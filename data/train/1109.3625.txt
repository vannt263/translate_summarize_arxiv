    "the four  nucleon ( 4n ) system has been object of intense studies in recent years . in first place , this system is particularly interesting as a  theoretical laboratory \" to test the accuracy of our present knowledge of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) and three nucleon ( 3n ) interactions .",
    "in particular , the effects of the nn p - waves and of the 3n force are believed to be larger than in the @xmath4 or @xmath5 systems .",
    "moreover , it is the simplest system where the 3n interaction in channels of total isospin @xmath6 can be studied . in second place",
    ", there is a number of reactions involving four nucleons which are of extreme importance for astrophysics , energy production , and studies of fundamental symmetries . as an example",
    ", reactions like @xmath7 or @xmath8 ( the @xmath9 process ) play important roles in solar models and in the theory of big - bang nucleosynthesis .    nowadays ,",
    "the 4n bound - state problem can be numerically solved with good accuracy .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the binding energies and other properties of the @xmath10-particle were studied using the av8@xmath11  @xcite nn interaction ; several different techniques produced results in very close agreement with each other ( at the level of less than 1% ) .",
    "more recently , the same agreement has also been obtained considering different realistic nn+3n force models  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has also been a rapid advance in solving the 4n scattering problem with realistic hamiltonians .",
    "accurate calculations of four - body scattering observables have been achieved in the framework of the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations  @xcite , solved in momentum space , where the long - range coulomb interaction is treated using the screening and renormalization method @xcite .",
    "also solutions of the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations in configuration space  @xcite and the application of the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) expansion method  @xcite to the solution of this problem have been reported  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these methods , the solution of the 4n scattering problem has been obtained also by using the resonating group model ( rgm ) method  @xcite .",
    "calculations of scattering observables using the green s function monte carlo method are also underway  @xcite .",
    "the 4n studies performed so far have evidenced several discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "let us consider first @xmath0 elastic scattering .",
    "calculations based on nn interaction models disagree  @xcite rather sizeably with the measured total cross section  @xcite , both at zero energy and in the `` peak '' region ( @xmath12 mev ) .",
    "this observable is found to be very sensitive to the nn interaction model  @xcite . at low energy ,",
    "the discrepancy is removed by including a 3n force fixed to reproduce the triton binding energy  @xcite , but it remains in the peak region .",
    "the analysis of the differential cross section has shown similar discrepancies , but definitive conclusions are difficult to extract since the experimental errors are rather large .    in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath1 elastic scattering is more interesting since there exist several accurate measurements of both the unpolarized cross section  @xcite and the proton analyzing power @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the calculations performed so far ( with a variety of nn and nn+3n interactions ) have shown a large discrepancy between theory and experiment for @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "in addition , at the triangle universities nuclear laboratory ( tunl ) , there has been recently a new set of accurate measurements of other @xmath1 observables ( the @xmath14 analyzing power @xmath15 and some spin correlation observables as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 mev , which has allowed a phase - shift analysis ( psa )  @xcite .",
    "a preliminary comparison with these data has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to have definite answer about the ability of the different interaction models to reproduce the experimental data it is certainly of interest to establish the accuracy reached by the theoretical methods in the solution of the @xmath25 scattering problem . in a previous benchmark",
    ", the results obtained by different groups working with different techniques were found to be at variance with each other  @xcite .",
    "clearly , this situation should be clarified before questioning the ability of present nn+3n force models to describe the experimental data beyond the binding energy of @xmath26he .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper , in which we present low energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering results obtained by three different groups , using independent methods to solve the four - body problem , i.e. , the ags equations , the variational hh expansion , and the fy equations .",
    "the potentials used in this paper are the i - n3lo model by entem and machleidt  @xcite , with cutoff @xmath27 mev , the argonne @xmath2 ( av18 ) potential model  @xcite , and a low-@xmath3 model derived from the cd - bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "the i - n3lo potential has been derived using an effective field theory approach and the chiral perturbation theory up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "the av18 potential is a phenomenological potential having a rather strong repulsion at short interparticle distances .",
    "the low@xmath28 potentials have been obtained separating the hilbert space into low and high momentum regions and using the renormalization group method  @xcite to integrate out the high - momentum components above a cutoff @xmath29 .",
    "the low@xmath28 potential adopted in this work is obtained starting from the realistic cd - bonn potential  @xcite and using a smooth cutoff @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the cut of the high - momentum part is reflected in configuration space in an almost total absence of the repulsion at short interparticle distances .",
    "note that the first and third model are non - local , while av18 is local in configuration space .",
    "the three potentials reproduce equally well the @xmath32 and @xmath33 data , and are a representative set of the large variety of modern nn potential models .",
    "we note finally that i - n3lo and av18 interactions , without the inclusion of a suitable 3n interaction model , largely underestimate the @xmath34 binding energy @xmath35 . on the contrary , with the adopted low-@xmath3 potential model we have @xmath36 mev , slightly overestimating the experimental value of @xmath37 mev .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : methods ] , a brief description of the methods used for this benchmark is reported . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , a comparison between the results obtained within the different schemes is shown . in section  [ sec : comp - theo - expt ] , the theoretical calculations are compared with the available experimental data .",
    "the conclusions will be given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in order to solve the 4n scattering problem we employ the ags equations , the hh method , and the fy equations .",
    "the various procedures are briefly described below .",
    "the total kinetic energy , @xmath38 , in the center of mass ( c.m . ) and the nucleon kinetic energy , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , in the laboratory reference frame are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reduced mass of the @xmath44 system , @xmath45 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath46 the magnitude of the relative momentum between the two clusters .",
    "the ags equations @xcite are integral equations for the four - body transition operators .",
    "they are well - defined only with short - range potentials .",
    "nevertheless , together with the screening and renormalization method @xcite , they can be applied also to the reactions involving charged particles . in the 4n system",
    "we use the isospin formalism and solve the symmetrized form of the ags equations @xcite . in this case",
    "there are only two distinct four - particle partitions , one of the @xmath47 type and one of the @xmath48 type .",
    "we choose those partitions to be ( 12,3)4 and ( 12)(34 ) and denote them in the following by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding transition operators @xmath51 for the initial states of the @xmath47 type , as appropriate for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering , obey the integral equations @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the free resolvent , @xmath54 being the energy of the 4n system and @xmath55 the free hamiltonian , and @xmath56 is the permutation operator of particles @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the ( short - range ) two - nucleon potential @xmath59 enters the ags equations via the two - nucleon transition matrix @xmath60 and the 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 subsystem transition operators @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the 3 + 1 elastic scattering amplitudes are given by @xmath64 where the factor 3 results from the symmetrization and @xmath65 are properly normalized initial / final channel state faddeev components .    in order to include the coulomb interaction @xmath66 between the protons in the @xmath1 scattering we use the screening and renormalization approach @xcite .",
    "we add to the nuclear @xmath33 potential the screened coulomb one @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the ags equations with @xmath68 are well - defined but all transition operators and the resulting amplitudes depend on the screening radius @xmath69 .",
    "the renormalization procedure in the @xmath70 limit yields the full @xmath1 transition amplitude @xmath71 |\\mathbf{p}_i \\rangle z_r^{-1 } ,      \\end{split}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the proper and screened coulomb amplitudes between the c.m . of two charged clusters , respectively ; the former is known analytically .",
    "the renormalization factor @xmath74 is defined in ref .",
    "thus , the long- and coulomb - distorted short - range parts in the scattering amplitudes are isolated and their infinite @xmath69 limit is calculated separately .",
    "the long - range part of the amplitude @xmath73 is of two - body nature and its @xmath70 limit after renormalization is @xmath72 .",
    "the coulomb - distorted short - range part @xmath75 $ ] is calculated by solving the ags equations for @xmath68 numerically at a finite @xmath69 that is sufficiently large to get @xmath69-independent results after the renormalization .",
    "in other words , the @xmath70 limit is reached with sufficient accuracy at finite @xmath69 .",
    "however , @xmath69 must be considerably larger than the range of the nuclear interaction thereby leading to a slower partial - wave convergence .",
    "the right choice of the screening , i.e. , the exponent @xmath41 , is essential in dealing with this difficulty . for a fast convergence with @xmath69 we have to ensure that @xmath76 approximates well @xmath77 for @xmath78 and simultaneously vanishes smoothly but rapidly for @xmath79 , providing a comparatively fast convergence of the partial - wave expansion . using the optimal value @xmath80 we obtain reasonably converged results with @xmath69 ranging from 10 to 15 fm and including two - proton partial waves with orbital angular momentum up to 10 .",
    "the @xmath69-convergence is slower at lower energies ; the worst cases are the @xmath81 waves at @xmath82 mev where we estimate the accuracy of our phase - shift results to be around 1% .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 results are converged very well , considerably better than 0.2% , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite where also the details on the included partial waves can be found .",
    "the wave function describing a @xmath0 or @xmath1 scattering state with total angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath83 , incoming relative orbital angular momentum @xmath84 , and channel spin @xmath81 ( @xmath85 ) can be written as @xmath86 where the part @xmath87 describes the system in the region where the particles are close to each other and their mutual interactions are strong .",
    "hence , @xmath87 vanishes in the limit of large inter - cluster distances .",
    "this part of the wave function is written as a linear expansion @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a set of basis functions constructed in terms of the hh functions ( for more details , see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the other part @xmath90 describes the relative motion of the two clusters in the asymptotic regions , where the @xmath44 interaction is negligible ( except eventually for the long - range coulomb interaction ) . in the asymptotic region",
    "the wave functions @xmath91 reduces to @xmath92 , which must therefore be the appropriate asymptotic solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "let us consider , for example , the @xmath1 case .",

    "moreover , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the regular and irregular coulomb function , respectively , with @xmath102 .",

    "( [ eq : psiom ] ) has been introduced to regularize @xmath101 at small @xmath104 , and @xmath105 as @xmath104 is large , thus not affecting the asymptotic behavior of @xmath91 .",

    "of course , the sum over @xmath113 and @xmath114 is over all values compatible with the given @xmath115 and parity @xmath116 . in particular ,",

    "is obtained for @xmath112 and @xmath122 .",
    "this linear system is solved using the lanczos algorithm .",
    "this method can be applied in either coordinate or momentum space , and using either local or non - local potentials  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an application to the @xmath125 scattering problem ) .",
    "the first step is a partial wave decomposition of the asymptotic functions @xmath126 , a task which can be rather time consuming , in particular for the @xmath127 state .",
    "after this decomposition , the calculation of the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kohn ] ) is fast .",
    "then , the problem reduces to the solution of the linear system , which is performed using an iterative method ( however , this solution has to be repeated several times due to the necessity to extrapolate the results , see below ) .",
    "the expansion of the scattering wave function in terms of the hh basis is in principle infinite , therefore a truncation scheme is necessary .",
    "the hh functions are essentially characterized by the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath128 , @xmath129 , associated with the three jacobi vectors , and the grand angular quantum number @xmath130 ( each hh function is a polynomial of degree @xmath130 ) .",
    "the basis is truncated to include states with @xmath131 ( with all possible re - coupling between angular and spin states appropriate to the given @xmath115 ) . between these states , we retain only the hh functions with @xmath132 . in the calculation",
    "we have included only states with total isospin @xmath133 .",
    "the numerical uncertainty comes from the numerical integrations needed to compute the matrix elements of the hamiltonian and the truncation of the basis .",
    "it has been checked that the numerical uncertainty of the calculated phase - shifts related to the numerical integration is small ( around @xmath134 % ) .",
    "the nn interaction has been limited to act on two - body states with total angular momentum @xmath135 ( at the considered energies , greater values of @xmath136 are completely unnecessary ) . the largest uncertainty is thus related to the use of a finite basis .",
    "the convergence with @xmath137 is rather fast and the value @xmath138 have been found to be sufficient .",
    "the main problem is related to the slow convergence of the results with @xmath139 .",
    "this problem can be partly overcome by performing calculations for increasing values of @xmath139 and then using some extrapolation rule ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) to get the `` @xmath140 '' result .",
    "this procedure has an uncertainty which can be estimated",
    ". a detailed study of this problem will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the quantities of interest in term of @xmath139 is slower when nn potentials with a strong repulsion at short interparticle distance are used such as for the av18 potential . in this case",
    "we have estimated the uncertainty to be of the order of @xmath141 % in the extrapolated phase - shifts .",
    "this problem is less relevant for the i - n3lo and the low-@xmath3 models . in these case , the uncertainty has been estimated to be at most @xmath142 % .      in late sixties ,",
    "yakubovsky  @xcite has managed to generalize the three - body equations derived by faddeev  @xcite to an arbitrary number of particles .",
    "these equations were primarily derived for a system of particles submitted to short range pair - wise potential @xmath143 .",
    "nevertheless it becomes possible to include also repulsive coulomb interaction if these , from now on called faddeev - yakubovsky equations , are formulated in configuration space .",
    "to this aim , we split the coulomb potential @xmath144 into two parts ( short and long range ) , @xmath145 .",
    "the splitting procedure is quite arbitrary , one should only take care that the long range part @xmath146 of the coulomb potential approaches sufficiently fast the full coulomb interaction @xmath144 when any of interparticle distances becomes large .",
    "the simplest application of fy equations is the problem of four identical particles .",
    "they result into a set of two differential equations coupling the two so called fy components , namely @xmath147 and @xmath148 , and have the form : @xmath149\\ , \\\\",

    "the label @xmath10 holds for the set of 10 intermediate quantum numbers describing a @xmath161 state in the partial wave basis .    the fy components @xmath156 are subject to dirichlet - type boundary condition imposed on a three dimensional rectangular grid .",
    "both components vanish on any of three @xmath162 , axes , as well as at the borders @xmath163 and @xmath164 of the chosen resolution grid . on contrary ,",
    "a boundary condition equivalent to eq .",

    "the expansion of the scattering wave function in terms of the partial wave basis is in principle infinite and a truncation scheme is necessary . in this work",
    "the partial wave basis was truncated to include all the states with @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , in the so - called @xmath170 coupling scheme  @xcite . by studying the convergence of the calculated phase - shifts with respect to the size of the partial wave basis",
    ", we have concluded that this truncation scheme should provide results accurate at 1% level .",
    "the numerical implementation of these equations is described in detail in ref .",
    "in this section we present the phase - shifts for the most relevant waves calculated using the three different methods described above .",

    "the states considered are those with @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",
    "the scattering in other @xmath178 states is dominated by the centrifugal barrier and therefore the phase - shifts are smaller and not very sensitive to the interaction and the method used to calculate them . note that , for the @xmath127 state , we have chosen to report only the @xmath179 phase - shift , since the @xmath180 phase - shift and the relative mixing parameter are in any case very small .",
    "nevertheless the coupling between the @xmath179 and @xmath180 waves has been included in the calculations , since the presence of the @xmath180 component in the asymptotic part of the wave function has a sizable effect on the @xmath179 phase - shift .",
    "let us remember that the @xmath81-matrix for elastic @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering has dimension 1 for @xmath175 states and dimension @xmath50 for @xmath181 . in the first case ,",

    "the strongest deviation , of the order of 0.4 deg , is observed with the fy results at the largest studied energy .",
    "this slightly larger deviation might be due to the necessity by the fy method to perform the transformation of the aforementioned potential to configuration space . in this respect ,",
    "we note that the ags calculation is fully performed in momentum space , while in the hh calculation , part of the needed matrix elements are calculated in momentum space ( those involving @xmath119 , which have to be calculated with more accuracy ) , and part in configuration space ( those involving @xmath194 ) .    in table",

    "also the @xmath196 and @xmath205 agree well , but for these cases the experimental errors are large . on the other hand , we note a sizeable underestimation of the large @xmath206 and @xmath179 phase - shifts .",
    "let us now see how the fairly good agreement found for the phase - shifts and mixing parameters calculated with the three different methods reflects on the observables .",

    "this observable is in fact rather sensitive to small variations of the phase - shifts in the kinematical regime considered in this paper .    in figs .  [",
    "fig : n3lo - nt ] and [ fig : n3lo - ph ] we have reported the results obtained using the ags equation ( solid lines ) , the hh expansion method ( dashed lines ) , and the fy equations ( dotted lines ) using the i - n3lo potential . as can be seen by inspecting the two figures , the three curves almost always perfectly coincide and can not be distinguished .",
    "we have also reported the experimental data for the @xmath0 differential cross section  @xcite and the three @xmath1 observables  @xcite .",
    "we note that the differences between the three calculations , where they can be appreciated , are in any case always smaller than the experimental errors .    the agreement between the three calculations when the av18 potential is adopted is again rather satisfactory , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : av18-nt ] and [ fig : av18-ph ] . a small disagreement can be observed only for the @xmath15 observable ( see the panels in the last row of fig.[fig : av18-ph ] ) .",
    "this observable is also rather sensitive to the small d - wave and f - wave phase - shifts not reported in tables  [ tab : nt - av18 ] and  [ tab : ph - av18 ] .",
    "we already know that the av18 model contains a stronger repulsion at short interparticle distance than the i - n3lo .",
    "as discussed above , the convergence of the hh method for this case is more problematic and consequently the calculations have a larger uncertainty . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "the agreement in the considered observables is still quite good .",
    "let us consider now the low-@xmath3 potential , which has no repulsion at short interparticle distance .",
    "consequently , in this case , we expect a good agreement between the results of the different techniques . for this potential",
    ", the calculations have been performed using the ags ( solid curves ) and hh ( dashed curves ) methods , only , and the corresponding results are reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : vlowk - nt ] and [ fig : vlowk - ph ]",
    ". the two curves are practically indistinguishable , confirming that for soft potentials the convergence of the calculations is excellent .",
    "finally , in the literature for @xmath1 scattering , there exist measurements of other spin correlation observables ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath20 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) .",
    "also for these observables we have found a good agreement between the predictions obtained by the three different methods , for all the potential models considered here .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical predictions and the experimental data for these observables will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss the comparison between the theoretical calculations and the experimental data .",
    "we consider here only @xmath1 scattering since for this process the experimental data are more abundant and precise .",
    "the figures presented in this section can be considered as an update of previous comparisons  @xcite .",
    "for the three observables considered so far ( @xmath207 , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 ) , the comparison between theory and experiment can be inferred already from figs .",
    "[ fig : n3lo - nt][fig : vlowk - ph ] . however , in order to better appreciate the differences in the predictions obtained by the three potential models as compared to the experimental data , we summarize again in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] the results for @xmath207 , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 . in order to take into account",
    "the ( slight ) different predictions obtained using the three different theoretical methods , we have decided to present the calculated observables for each potential as bands .",
    "each band contains the results obtained by using the three different methods . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , the differential unpolarized cross sections obtained using the i - n3lo potential ( red bands ) agree well with the experimental data . with the other two potentials we observe some disagreement , in particular around @xmath208 deg and in the large scattering angle region . the results obtained for @xmath13",
    "are found to depend on the potential model . here , we observe the well known underprediction of the experimental data by the theoretical calculations .",
    "interestingly , the results obtained with the low-@xmath3 potential are in a better agreement with the experimental @xmath13 .",
    "a similar situation is found also for @xmath15 , as can be seen in the three lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "it is worthy to note that the effect of supplementing the av18 potential with the urbana 3n force model  @xcite has been found to be almost negligible for this observable  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the new chiral 3n potential derived in ref .",
    "@xcite is under study  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a preliminary report ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , we report the results found for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 spin correlations at the three different proton energies . as can be seen , for these two observables the predictions obtained with the three potentials are almost identical .",
    "we observe that the calculated @xmath16 is slightly at variance with respect to the experimental data , while the @xmath17 observable is reasonably well reproduced by the calculations .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] we compare the results obtained for the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 spin correlation observables . in this case , only the @xmath209 proton laboratory energy is considered , since only for this energy experimental data exist . also in this case , the sensitivity to the different potential models is not significant .",
    "moreover , the calculations reproduce well the ( few ) experimental data .",
    "in this work , we have studied several low energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic observables by using three different approaches , the hh , ags and fy techniques . around four years ago , some of the authors of the present paper presented very accurate solutions of the 4-nucleon scattering problem using the ags technique  @xcite .",
    "they were able to take into account the long - range coulomb interaction using the screening - renormalization method  @xcite . in recent years , also the accuracy of the calculations performed using the hh and fy techniques increased  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it becomes appropriate to compare the results obtained by the different methods in order to test their capability to solve the 4n scattering problem .",
    "this is the primary aim of the present paper .",
    "another important motivation is to provide a set of solid converged results in the literature , which could represent useful benchmarks for future applications in @xmath25 scattering .    in the present paper",
    "we have shown that for i - n3lo and the selected low-@xmath3 potential model , which have a `` soft '' repulsion at short interparticle distances ( the low-@xmath3 model has no repulsion at all ) , the results obtained by the different techniques are in very good agreement . with the av18 potential , the agreement is not so perfect , although the ( slight ) differences can be appreciated only for some small polarization observables .",
    "we can conclude therefore , that the @xmath25 scattering problem is nowadays solved with a very good accuracy , better than 1% .    concerning the comparison with the experimental data ,",
    "we have confirmed the large underprediction of the @xmath1 @xmath13 observable , a problem already put in evidence some time ago  @xcite , and certainly related to the @xmath210 `` @xmath211 puzzle '' . for this",
    "observable we have observed a moderate dependence on the considered potential models .",
    "the low-@xmath3 potential is found to give a better description of the observable when compared with the experimental data .",
    "however , the same potential does not reproduce well the unpolarized cross section .",
    "we have also found a small underprediction of the theoretical @xmath15 and @xmath16 observables , while other measured observables , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 spin correlation coefficients , show less sensitivity to the potential models .",
    "they are in good agreement with the available ( sparse ) experimental data .",
    "the discrepancies found , in particular for @xmath13 , indicate a serious difficulty of the existing nn force models in describing the 4n continuum .",
    "this difficulty can hardly be solved by the inclusion of a standard type 3nf , used to reproduce the few - nucleon binding energies  @xcite .",
    "its origin could rather lie either in the nn forces themselves , or in the presence of a 3nf of unknown type .",
    "clearly , an eventual solution of the @xmath25 @xmath13 problem should be related in some way to the solution of the @xmath210 `` @xmath211 puzzle '' .    finally , we conclude noticing that it would be interesting to extend the present analysis to @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 scattering observables , which have already been calculated in the framework of the ags equations for different nn interactions   @xcite .",
