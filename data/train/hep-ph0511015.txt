    "the qcd phase diagram exhibits an astonishingly rich phase structure . the ( pseudo- ) critical line , which separates the phase dominated by quark and gluon degrees of freedom at large temperature @xmath0 and baryo - chemical potential @xmath1 from the one dominated by hadrons and resonances , has been investigated by means of lattice gauge theory  @xcite . from theoretical reasoning  @xcite for finite quark masses ,",
    "the phase transition is of first order at finite @xmath0 and large @xmath1 ending in a critical point of second order . for smaller @xmath1 ,",
    "thermodynamic observables change rapidly but continuously indicating a crossover regime . there ,",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) has been computed for @xmath2 quark flavours  @xcite . while the location of the critical end point ( cep ) showing a strong quark mass dependence  @xcite",
    "was determined by first principle qcd evaluations  @xcite , the extension of the critical region is fairly unknown .",
    "lattice qcd studies of the volume dependence of the binder cumulant  @xcite indicate that the cep belongs to the static universality class of the 3d ising model . at present",
    ", many investigations aim to study implications of such a fundamental issue of qcd .",
    "in particular , observable consequences of the occurrence of the cep as novel feature of qcd are discussed  @xcite . heaving in mind the successful hydrodynamical description of the expansion stage in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "one intriguing problem concerns the manner the eos of strongly interacting matter becomes modified by the cep .",
    "this is the subject of the present contribution .    in  [ sec :",
    "taylorcoeffs ] , the quasi - particle model is shortly reviewed and compared with recent lattice qcd results .",
    "we focus on the taylor series expansion coefficients  @xcite . in  [ sec : cep ] , cep effects on the eos are discussed for a toy model and for our qcd based quasi - particle model .",
    "the results are summarized in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "thermodynamic observables can be expressed as taylor series expansions in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "accordingly , the pressure is decomposed into @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 . in  @xcite",
    ", the taylor expansion coefficients up to @xmath8 have been presented basing on first principle qcd evaluations .    achieving a flexible parametrization of the eos",
    ", we formulated a model which describes the quark - gluon fluid in terms of quasi - particle excitations  @xcite @xmath9 here , @xmath10 denote thermodynamic standard expressions for quarks and transverse gluons with dynamically generated self - energies @xmath11 and a non - perturbative effective coupling @xmath12 as essential input .",
    "thermodynamic self - consistency is ensured through the stationarity conditions @xmath13 , imposing in turn conditions onto @xmath14 . from maxwell",
    "s relation for @xmath15 , a flow equation for @xmath12 follows  @xcite @xmath16 knowing @xmath17 on an arbitrary curve in the @xmath0 - @xmath18 plane ,  ( [ equ : flow ] ) can be solved as a cauchy problem . for convenience ,",
    "we adjust @xmath19 to lattice data at @xmath20 enabling a mapping into the finite chemical potential region via  ( [ equ : flow ] ) .",
    "the taylor expansion coefficients follow straightforwardly from  ( [ equ : pres2 ] ) as integral expressions involving @xmath17 and higher order derivatives of the effective coupling at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the latter can be computed by exploiting the flow equation  ( [ equ : flow ] ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in fig .  1 ,",
    "a fairly good agreement between taylor expansion coefficients from the quasi - particle model and lattice results is shown .",
    "-.5 cm [ fig : coeffs ]    4.9 cm     +    -4 mm    5.5 cm    1.3 cm    in particular , the peak in @xmath21 and the dipole structure in @xmath8 are reproduced .",
    "adjusting the parametrization of the effective coupling onto @xmath22 dictates a change in @xmath19 at @xmath23 mev from a regularized logarithmic dependence ( resembling the perturbative behaviour at large @xmath0 ) into a linear dependence .",
    "this change in the curvature of @xmath17 can be considered as implemented phase transition and is responsible for the pronounced structures in @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , these structures disappear when neglecting higher order derivatives of the effective coupling in the integral expressions of @xmath24 serving for a test of the flow equation  ( [ equ : flow ] ) .",
    "starting from a thermodynamic potential , e.  g. gibbs free enthalpy , it can be decomposed into an analytic and a non - analytic part where the latter is related to phase transitions and critical phenomena  @xcite . accordingly",
    ", the eos formulated in terms of the entropy density is given through @xmath25 . here , the analytic contribution @xmath26 has to be adjusted to the known eos outside of the critical region .",
    "the non - analytic part @xmath27 should embody the feature of being continuous left to the cep ( i.  e. at small chemical potentials ) whereas on the right ( at large chemical potentials ) it generates a first order phase transition .",
    "a convenient parametrization of @xmath27 for the 3d ising model characterized by a set of critical exponents is given in  @xcite .",
    "still , the corresponding variables employed usually in condensed matter physics including the order parameter need to be mapped into the @xmath0 - @xmath1 plane in the vicinity of the cep .",
    "details of this mapping and a useful formulation of the entropy density contribution can be found in the pioneering work  @xcite we rely on . in the following ,",
    "we estimate the phase border line to be given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 according to  @xcite and locate the cep at @xmath30 mev in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "-.5 cm [ fig : transbag ] -2 mm    as a simple toy model , let us employ the first terms in  ( [ equ : pres1 ] ) , however , with constant expansion coefficients .",
    "the entropy density contributions are given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath34 follows from  ( [ equ : entrdens ] ) via standard thermodynamic relations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) with integration constant @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the ansatz for @xmath27 has been chosen such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and the net baryon density vanishes at @xmath39 .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 describes the strength of the non - analytic contribution in the eos .",
    "we apply the same @xmath41 as in  @xcite assuming a fairly large critical region parametrized by @xmath42 mev , @xmath43 mev and a stretch factor @xmath44 .",
    "hence , cep effects on the eos and in particular on isentropic trajectories @xmath45 in the @xmath0 - @xmath1 plane can be demonstrated . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the influence of the strength parameter @xmath40 on the behaviour of isentropic trajectories is exhibited . for increasing @xmath46 ,",
    "the trajectories for large @xmath47 tend to be attracted towards larger @xmath1 due to the presence of the cep .",
    "in fact , the cep acts as an attractor on trajectories on the left whereas on the right a repulsive impact is found .",
    "evidently , the curves on the right side of the cep display the existence of the first order phase transition . by shrinking the critical region to @xmath48 mev , @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 , the influence of the cep decreases ( right panel of fig .",
    "2 ) in comparison with the results obtained for a large critical region ( left panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "in particular , the sections on the hadronic side become less affected when decreasing the extension of the critical region .",
    "the parameters in the non - analytic entropy density contribution and in particular @xmath40 have to be chosen such that standard thermodynamic consistency conditions are satisfied  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , during the adiabatic expansion of the system and its related cooling , both @xmath34 and @xmath51 must decrease . for @xmath52 with trajectories for large @xmath47",
    "bent to smaller @xmath1 due to the cep inclusion , however , these conditions are violated in the vicinity of the first order transition line .",
    "therefore , the pattern of the isentropic trajectories as exhibited in fig .  2    [ fig : isentrops ] -2 mm    -.1 cm    seems to be generic ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a different model with cep which involves a hadronic low - temperature and a partonic high - temperature phase ) .",
    "clearly , this statement decisively depends on @xmath51 in the hadronic phase where the simple toy model can not account for qcd .",
    "in contrast , being inspired by lattice qcd we construct the eos as truncated taylor series expansion including the coefficients @xmath53 of fig .  1 .",
    "these lattice based trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isentrops ] ( left panel ) where the pattern differs notably from the observations made in the above toy model . although first principle evaluations still suffer from too heavy quark masses and deviate consequently from the resonance gas trajectories in the low - temperature phase , the values @xmath47 on these lattice qcd deduced curves agree with the values at the according nearby chemical freeze - out points inferred from data  @xcite . furthermore , in the deconfined phase lattice results are trustable due to convergence radius studies  @xcite at least up to @xmath54 mev .",
    "therefore , adjusting the analytic contribution of the eos known from the lattice data by our quasi - particle model , critical end point effects should become visible only for larger @xmath1 implying a small critical region .",
    "we include the cep in line with the procedure outlined above in our quasi - particle model replacing @xmath55 by @xmath56 in @xmath27 and considering a small critical region characterized by @xmath48 mev , @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 with strength parameter @xmath59 . as exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : isentrops ] ( right panel ) , cep effects on isentropic trajectories are significant only for large @xmath1 with negligible impact on the hadronic sections .",
    "nonetheless , the baryon number susceptibility @xmath60 being a measure for baryon number fluctuations diverges for @xmath61 ( fig .  4 right panel ) due to the discontinuity evolving in @xmath34 in contrast to the analytic behaviour ( fig .  4 left panel ) stemming from the quasi - particle model not containing cep effects .",
    "-.5 cm [ fig : suscept ]",
    "our quasi - particle model without implemented cep was successfully compared with recent lattice qcd results of the taylor series expansion coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath62 . accordingly , our extrapolation procedure into the finite chemical potential region was tested .",
    "we considered simple models including phenomenologically the qcd critical end point and studied the effects on isentropic trajectories .",
    "we followed  @xcite and looked for indications of the cep acting generically as attractor or repulsor .",
    "in fact , this is of interest with respect to the question whether cep effects show up in heavy ion experiments only in a very narrow beam energy range .",
    "clearly , appropriate dynamical simulations are needed to account properly for such questions .",
    "the study of the pattern of isentropic trajectories is only a first step towards elucidating possible implications of the very existence of the cep in qcd .      c.  r.  allton et al .",
