    "one of the main theoretical challenges to understand the b meson phenomenology resides in the matrix elements calculation of the non - leptonic decay channels .",
    "several methods were developed in order to deal with these decays .",
    "the first to treat this problem were bauer , stech and wirbel , proposing the factorization assumption ( fa ) and applying it successfully to several decays @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , this method fails when there are important non - factorizable contributions .",
    "different approaches were developed later in order to make progress in these type of calculations .",
    "one way to proceed , based on the collinear factorization theorem , is the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) formalism as applied by brodsky _",
    "@xcite , where it is considered that the non - leptonic decays of heavy mesons are dominated by hard gluon exchange and the amplitudes are computed based on the hard exclusive hadronic scattering analysis developed by lepage and brodsky @xcite . a powerful method to deal with these decays",
    "has been proposed by beneke _",
    "@xcite-@xcite , which results from the union of the fa and pqcd in the collinear approximation , hereafter indicated by qcdf ( qcd factorization ) .",
    "these authors argue that the transition form factors , that enter in the calculation of @xmath0 meson decays , can not be obtained through perturbative methods because they are dominated by `` soft '' interactions , which is a problem that the pqcd advocates claim to be solved by the suppression due to sudakov factors . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - factorizable contributions are dominated by hard gluon exchanges .",
    "therefore , in qcdf the terms that are dependent on the transition form factors are parameterized as in the fa formalism , and the non - factorizable contributions are perturbatively calculated in the collinear approximation .    unfortunately",
    ", the formalisms based on the collinear approximations fail in the cases where there are non - factorizable contributions related to interactions with the spectator quark and for annihilation interactions due to the appearance of endpoint divergences , respectively at twist-3 and twist-2 , indicating the presence of non - perturbative physics and the breaking of the factorization hypothesis @xcite . in the qcdf formalism",
    "these divergences can be parameterized at the cost of some uncertainty in the calculation .",
    "these contributions are power suppressed in general , and are negligible in front of the factorizable contributions .",
    "this means that qcdf can be successfully applied by simply neglecting such contributions .",
    "however , annihilation diagrams can generate strong phases that are relevant for the cp violation .",
    "besides that , there are decays that occur only through annihilation diagrams .",
    "these are quite rare decays , and most of them are beyond the present experimental limits .",
    "it is expected that they will be detected soon , with the advent of lhcb ( lhc , cern ) , or even earlier by the experiment cdf ( tevatron , fermilab ) .",
    "these are the decays that we expect to be sensitive to the infrared qcd behavior .    in this work",
    "we compute some of the decay channels of @xmath1 and @xmath2 which occur only through the annihilation diagrams : @xmath3 and @xmath4 . working in the hard scattering",
    "collinear approximation of brodsky and lepage , we will use non - perturbative solutions for the gluon propagator and for the running coupling constant that were obtained with the help of the gluonic schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) .",
    "these non - perturbative solutions lead to a gluon propagator and coupling constant that are finite in the infrared , and this fact will naturally supplant , at leading twist , the divergences that we discussed in the previous paragraph by providing a natural infrared cutoff .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath0 mesons decays is known and thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "however , the same can not be said about the use of sde solutions in the strong interaction phenomenology , and for this reason it is interesting to recall some aspects of this approach .",
    "the sde form an infinite tower of coupled equations that in order to be solved must be truncated at some order .",
    "most of the solutions obtained so far are gauge dependent and differ among themselves .",
    "it is not surprising that sde for the qcd propagator and coupling constant lead to different solutions as long as they are solved with different truncations and approximations .",
    "there is a class of solutions for the gluon propagator that goes to @xmath5 as the momentum @xmath6 , as well as another solution that goes to a value different from @xmath7 at the origin of momenta , whose inverse value is usually denominated as a dynamical gluon mass .",
    "a discussion about the different solutions can be found in the introduction of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the main references are also quoted .",
    "only very recently it was claimed that a gauge invariant truncation of the qcd sde can be obtained systematically @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the infrared finite behavior of the gluon propagator has also been confirmed by lattice simulations @xcite , with strong evidence for a gluon propagator with a value at the origin of momenta different from zero @xcite . accepting the evidences for an infrared finite gluon propagator and coupling constant ,",
    "now we are faced with the problem of how to introduce these quantities in phenomenological calculations .",
    "there are several calculations where the sde solutions for the gluon propagator and coupling constant were used in phenomenological problems , see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite . in all these calculations",
    "the fact that the gluon propagator and coupling constant are finite is essential for the result , in such a way that no good agreement with the experimental data is obtained without appealing to such behavior .",
    "this happens , for example , in the case of a non - perturbative pomeron model @xcite or in a pion form factor calculation @xcite .",
    "note that an infrared finite coupling constant also appears in the context of the so called analytic perturbation theory @xcite-@xcite , and it improves considerably the series convergence of qcd perturbative calculations . on the other hand",
    ", we also expect that any infrared finite gluon propagator leads to a freezing of the infrared coupling constant @xcite , meaning that the use of an infrared finite gluon propagator must be accompanied by an infrared finite coupling constant .",
    "these finite expressions for the coupling constant and gluon propagator should be used in actual calculations in the sense of the dynamical perturbation theory ( dpt ) proposed by pagels and stokar many years ago @xcite .",
    "a finite coupling can also be interpreted as an effective charge , as performed in several perturbative qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "finally , the characteristic mass scale of these solutions is at least a factor @xmath8 above the qcd scale ( @xmath9 ) , and for some of the solutions the freezing of the coupling constant happens at a relatively small value @xcite . according to brodsky @xcite , the inclusion of such effects , as the freezing of the qcd running coupling at low energy scales , could allow to reliably capture the non - perturbative qcd effects at an inclusive level",
    ".    the physics of non - leptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons may furnish another important test in the quest of learning about the non - perturbative behavior of the gluon propagator and the running coupling constant .",
    "one of these non - perturbative sde solutions ( the one of ref .",
    "@xcite ) has already been used to compute the decay amplitudes of @xmath0 mesons @xcite-@xcite , although the effect of the associated infrared finite coupling constant was not taken into account in these studies . in this work",
    "we test several solutions and show that they lead to different predictions for the branching ratios of @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "of course , there are many physical quantities that can also modify the decay rates , but keeping unchanged all the same quantities ( like wave functions and others ) while varying only the coupling constants and gluon propagators we come to the conclusion that a systematic study of these decays will help to select a specific qcd infrared behavior .",
    "this paper is organized as following : in sec .  2 we present the basic approach to study the non - leptonic @xmath0 meson decays . in sec .",
    "3 we show the annihilation amplitudes for the different @xmath0 decays . in sec .  4 we discuss the different non - perturbative solutions for the gluon propagator and the running coupling constant .",

    "the effect of the infrared finite gluon propagators affects only the hard part of the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the introduction of an infrared finite gluon propagator means that as we lower the energy we can not neglect anymore the gluon dressing that is predicted by the sde .",

    "secondly , to also have an expansion consistent with a @xmath136 expansion for b meson decays it will be necessary to solve the coupled schwinger - dyson equations for the gluon and fermion propagators , and this is quite away from the present status of the theory .",
    "the only point that can be guessed at the moment is that the results for infrared finite gluon propagator will be only slightly changed by fermionic effects as far as the number of quarks remains equal to the known one .    in this section",
