    "novel probe technologies  @xcite are very important for studying electronic properties in nanoscale systems because they are often beyond the resolution of conventional imaging techniques like optical microscopy , and traditional transport measurements can only measure spatially averaged physical properties such as the conductance or the current .",

    "using this technique one can obtain spatially resolved measurement of the electronic properties , including the local electron density and , in principle , the wavefunction itself in the case of a one - electron system  @xcite(see discussions below ) .",
    "this imaging technique has been fruitfully applied to study the flow of ballistic electrons across a range of two dimensional heterostructures .",

    "both the voltage of the probe and its height above the surface can also be independently varied .",

    ", we consider the coulomb blockade peak @xmath31 of the transition from @xmath32 to @xmath33 electron ground states .",
    "the conductance through the quantum wire is maximum when the chemical potential difference between the lead and the wire , controlled by the voltage @xmath34 on a back gate , is equal to the ground state energy difference between the two states in question .",
    "we may write this condition as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a constant and @xmath37 is the proportionality constant between changes in the back gate voltage and the chemical potential in the quantum dot .",
    "we probe the electronic states in the quantum wire through the dependence of @xmath38 on the tip position @xmath23 and potential strength @xmath22 .",
    "an interesting set of spatially resolved information about the electrons in the wire can be extracted from this function , and we call this method `` coulomb blockade microscopy ''",
    ". it is a special application of the `` scanning probe microscopy '' developed by the westervelt group  @xcite . in calculations in this paper we focus on the transition from @xmath39 to @xmath26 electrons , but most of our conclusions are easily generalizable to other ground state transitions .",
    "finally , we note that for four non - interacting electrons with spin in a wire of radius @xmath40 , when the dot length @xmath41 , the lowest four single particle energy levels are all longitudinal modes .",
    "the shortest wire length we consider in this paper @xmath42 , we therefore expect the wires under consideration can be well approximated as strictly 1d under the assumption of weak interaction effects .",

    "thus we expect the quantum wire to be well approximated by a 1d model for all the parameters we explored in this paper .",
    "the existence of higher transverse modes will lead to a renormalization of the effective electron - electron interaction ( generally a softening of the potential at short distances ) even if the energies of the modes are well above the fermi energy .",
    "this is because two electrons that come close together in the lowest transverse mode will mix , virtually , with states where the electrons are in excited modes .",
    "as our calculations use , already , a crude phenomenological cut - off at short distances , we do not include explicitly effects of this renormalization .",
    "technically , the existence of higher transverse modes can also lead to three - body and four - body effective interactions , arising from three - body and four - body collisions , but we do not expect such higher body terms to be important in the wires under consideration .    we want to emphasize that although we choose a specific wire geometry and a specific form of interaction that model some characteristics of the setup of the westervelt group s on - going experiments , most features of the coulomb blockade micrographs we discuss below are applicable to any 1d quantum dot system under a mobile potential .",
    "indeed , our discussions of the qualitative features of coulomb blockade micrographs under both the weak - tip and the strong - tip limits rely only on the general properties of 1d electronic systems , independent of the specific geometry and interaction we adopt .",

    "the scenario is illustrated in fig .",

    "when tip is near the center of the wire , the electrons are partitioned @xmath85 and both electrons in each side reside in the single - particle ground state . as the tip moves rightward , the energy levels rise in the right partition and fall in the left .",
    "when the first excited level on the left partition crosses the ground state on the right , @xmath86 electrons will move to the left partition . therefore ,",
    "contrary to the interacting case , there is no energetically favorable state of @xmath87 partitioning in the non - interacting system . in the @xmath39 case ,",
    "the @xmath88 partition is not affected by this , and for non - interacting system the transition @xmath81 will coincide with the transition in @xmath26 , so the coulomb blockade micrograph will show only a single peak .",
    "this analysis can also be generalized to a wire containing multiple non - interacting electrons , such that all the @xmath89 partitionings of electron number will be missing .    as schematically",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : strong_schematic ] , panels @xmath90 , when we take electron interaction into consideration , the one and two electron state would no longer be degenerate in either partition , so contrary to the non - interacting scenarios in panel @xmath84 , here a @xmath87 partition can survive as an intermediate stage between the @xmath85 and @xmath91 partitions . with the non - interacting case in mind , we postulate that the distance between two peaks in @xmath39 to @xmath26 micrographs , corresponding to the tip positions where @xmath87 partitioning in the @xmath26 wire is stable , can serve as an indicator of the relative importance of the interaction energy versus the sum of kinetic and single particle potential energies .",

    "[ fig : length_strong_tip ] for a charge @xmath59 , even at @xmath98 .",

    "[ fig : micrograph_tip ] however , if we calculate the electron density in the wire when the tip is over the center of the wire ( @xmath100 ) , we find that a tip charge of @xmath94 is enough to substantially modify the density relative to the density in the absence of the tip .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_under_tip ] , the electron density below the tip , at @xmath47 is reduced by a factor of three relative to the density with no tip charge .",
    "nevertheless , the oscillations seen in @xmath48 remain qualitatively similar to structure seen in the absence of the tip .",
    "for example , the charged tip only pushes out the position of the secondary minimum in the density from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "in general , when we increase the tip potential to intermediate values , the resolution of our micrographs improves compared with the weak tip limit .",
    "this is evident in the fact that at @xmath95 we can already see signs of wigner crystallization at @xmath96 , in contrast with the weak tip case with @xmath57 where we can only detect quasi - wigner crystal at @xmath103 . on the other hand , at @xmath95",
    "there is _ no _ signature of wigner crystallization when the electrons are in a liquid state in a @xmath44 wire .",
    "thus we do not have `` false positive '' signature of quasi - wigner crystal , in contrast with the strong tip limit described in section[strong ] , where the micrographs show @xmath33 peaks for a @xmath33-electron wire regardless whether , in the wire in the absence of the tip , the electrons are in a liquid or a quasi - wigner crystal state .",
    "because of these two characteristics , an intermediate tip potential may help an experimentalist to reliably detect the presence of a quasi - wigner crystal state in a shorter , higher density wire closer to the crossover from a liquid state .",
    "beyond the system of interacting electrons discussed above , a possible further application of coulomb blockade microscopy is to experimentally `` map '' the rugged potential landscape produced by wire inhomogeneities and charged impurities in the substrate .",
    "one would focus on the transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 state , in which case the coulomb blockade micrograph would reveal information about the single particle density . by inverting the transformation in eq .",

    ", the ground state wavefunction @xmath104 has no nodes and can be chosen to be @xmath105 it is then straightforward to invert the schrdinger s equation to extract the potential landscape from the single particle wavefunction .",
    "in summary , in this paper we show that tracking the peak position shift as a charged mobile tip moves above and across a nanowire , a technique we term coulomb blockade microscopy , can reveal spatially - resolved information about the electronic density and states of a quantum 1d dot .",
    "a weak tip potential can serve as a probe with a tunable width , to reveal the spatial distribution of the electronic density in the wire .",
    "a strong tip potential that depletes part of the wire can be used to manipulate individual electrons from one partition to the other , and the accompanying coulomb blockade micrograph can indicate the transitions between different partitionings . furthermore , a feature of the resulting micrograph , the distance between peaks marking the @xmath89 partitioning , can serve as an indicator of the relative strength of the interaction .    in this paper",
    "we have chosen extreme values of the tip charge @xmath22 to illustrate the physics in the two limits .",
    "however , our calculations show that the discussions above hold true for a wider range of moderately small and large values of @xmath22 .    to obtain a quantitative description of the energy shifts expected in coulomb blockade microscopy , particularly in the intermediate coupling regime ,",
    "we see that it is necessary to perform a realistic calculation , which takes into account both the electron - electron interaction and the non - linear effects of the charged tip on the electronic state of the wire .",
    "if one is prepared to carry out such a calculation , however , coulomb blockade microscopy can be a powerful probe of interaction effects in the wire .",
