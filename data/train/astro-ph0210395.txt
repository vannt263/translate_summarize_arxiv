    "pg1605 + 072 is a high amplitude multiperiodic pulsating sdb star .",
    "multisite photometry over 15 nights by found up to 55 frequencies between 1.75mhz , although some may be artifacts of amplitude variation .",
    "amplitudes in white light are typically between 1 and 30mmag . from spectral analysis , determined @xmath2=32300k , log@xmath1=5.25 , log(he / h)=@xmath32.53 and @xmath4=39kms@xmath5 .    reported the detection of velocity variations in 5 balmer lines of pg1605 + 072 using small telescopes over 10 nights . in a more detailed study , detected 8 frequencies in velocity , with observations taken over 3 months",
    ". some of these may be artifacts of amplitude variation .",
    "presented 32h of 4 m spectroscopy and detected the dominant modes .",
    "equivalent width variations in the balmer lines have also been detected by , with large amplitude variations between different balmer lines .",
    "here we present rapid spectrophotometry of pg1605 + 072 based on the spectra of .",
    "using the spectra obtained by otoole et al .",
    "( 2002a ) we have calculated three spectrophotometric time - series : one of the entire spectrum , which we will call `` blue light '' ; one of the bluest continuum , which we denote @xmath6 ; and one between h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 , avoiding the he i 4471  line , which we denote @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath6 filter is centred on @xmath103700 , with a width of 110 , while the @xmath9 filter is centred on @xmath104570 , with a width of 175 .",
    "the blue light time - series is shown in figure [ fig : bluetime ] .",
    "variation over each night is due to variable slit losses and changing weather conditions .",
    "figure [ fig : photspec ] shows the amplitude spectra of each time - series .",
    "there appears to be some amplitude variation between the different passbands .",
    "we fit the frequencies found by otoole et al .",
    "( 2002a ) to each time - series and found that all modes we detected in the different passbands are in phase .",
    "the ratios of @xmath6 to @xmath9 amplitudes are also the same for each mode , which is consistent with them having the same @xmath11 value .",
    "we can not , however , be certain of this result , without detailed modelling .",
    "the phase differences between velocity and intensity for each mode are shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : velhewph ] , while the difference between balmer - line velocity and equivalent width are shown in figure [ fig : velhewph ] .",
    "we calculated the average phase difference between velocity and intensity variations ( @xmath12 ) to be @xmath13 degrees .",
    "positive velocity indicates redshift . for reference",
    "the sun has phase differences between @xmath10120 degrees and @xmath10130 degrees dependent on frequency    the average phase difference between velocity and equivalent width oscillations is @xmath14 degrees",
    ". therefore the equivalent width variations are approximately 180 degrees out of phase with the intensity variations , approximately what is expected - as the star gets hotter , the equivalent width of the balmer line decreases .",
    "these phase differences are a measure of the degree of non - adiabaticity of the oscillation in pg1605 + 072 and sdbs generally .    this work was supported by an australian postgraduate award ( sjot ) , the australian research council , the danish national science research council through its center for ground - based observational astronomy , and the danish national research foundation through its establishment of the theoretical astrophysics center ."
