    "<S> validity of modified finite - size scaling above the upper critical dimension is demonstrated for the quantum phase transition whose dynamical critical exponent is @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the @xmath1-component bose - hubbard model , which is exactly solvable and exhibits mean - field type critical phenomena in the large-@xmath1 limit . </S>",
    "<S> the modified finite - size scaling holds exactly in that limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , the usual procedure , taking the large system - size limit with fixed temperature , does not lead to the expected ( and correct ) mean - field critical behavior due to the limited range of applicability of the finite - size scaling form . by quantum monte carlo simulation </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the same holds in the case of @xmath2 . </S>"
