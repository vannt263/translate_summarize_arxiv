    "from the fact that @xmath2 when normalised to the stellar mass of a galaxy @xmath2 the specific globular cluster ( * gc * ) frequency @xmath6 is a factor of @xmath7 higher in ellipticals than in spirals , zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) predict that if elliptical galaxies are formed from one major spiral @xmath2 spiral merger the number of gcs formed during the merger- induced starburst should be of the same order of magnitude as the number of gcs present in the progenitor galaxies .",
    "the high burst strengths and star formation ( * sf * ) efficiencies in massive gas - rich spiral @xmath2 spiral mergers and in ir - ultraluminous galaxies led to expect the formation of star clusters so tightly bound that they are able to survive as gcs ( fritze @xmath2 v. alvensleben & gerhard 1994 ) .",
    "fritze @xmath2 v. alvensleben & gerhard ( 1994 ) predicted the metallicity range of stars and star clusters formed in massive gas - rich ( i.e. late type ) spiral@xmath2spiral mergers on the basis of the ism abundances of the progenitor galaxies to be @xmath8 or @xmath9 } \\lta -0.2 $ ] .    in many interacting galaxies and merger remnants , bright blue knots",
    "have by now been observed ( cf .",
    "e.g. lutz 1991 , holtzman 1992 , whitmore 1993 , hunter 1994 , oconnell 1994 , 1995 , conti & vacca 1994 , borne 1996 , meurer 1995 ) .",
    "these bright blue knots , of course , immediately raised the question as to their identity : are these young star clusters ( * ysc * ) @xmath2 or , at least , some of them @xmath2 the progenitors of gcs ? and , if the latter were true , how many of them are typically formed in a merger ?",
    "how many will be able to survive in the tidal field of two massive interacting spirals ?",
    "can such a higher metallicity subpopulation be identified in gc systems ( hereafter * gcs * ) around merger remnants and perhaps even around normal ellipticals ?",
    "could the metallicity distribution of a gcs give information about the origin of its parent galaxy ( cf .",
    "zepf & ashman 1993 ) ? or should all of these bright blue knots be open clusters / ob associations ( van den bergh 1995 ) most of which will disperse within few gyr ?",
    "the discussion of the nature of these yscs is focussed on two aspects , their effective radii r@xmath10 and their luminosity function . in mergers at distances of the antennae or ngc 7252 , effective radii as measured on wfpc1 images are clearly overestimated .",
    "however , it has been shown that for ysc systems close enough the mean effective radii do readily fall within the range of gc radii ( meurer 1995 ) .",
    "our focus in this paper is the luminosity and colour evolution of the ysc population in the antennae and , in particular , the future evolution of the ysc s lf .    in a previous paper , we model the evolution of star clusters for different initial metallicities in terms of broad band colours and stellar metallicity indices .",
    "we find important colour differences for clusters of various metallicities , already at young ages , and showed that once the stellar metallicity is known , rather precise age dating becomes possible .",
    "comparison with young star clusters in ngc 7252 ( whitmore 1993 ) , the two brightest of which have spectroscopy available ( schweizer & seitzer 1993 ) , confirmed a metallicity of @xmath11 predicted from our global starburst modelling in this sc @xmath2 sc merger remnant .",
    "the mean age of the young star cluster population was shown to agree well with the global burst age of @xmath12 gyr , and ages derived from solar metallicity models would differ by a factor @xmath7 ( see fritze @xmath2 v. alvensleben & burkert 1995 for details ) .",
    "observationally , the best case by now to study the lf of yscs are the antennae with more than 700 young star clusters detected by whitmore & schweizer ( 1995 , hereafter * ws95 * ) , a number large enough to allow for a statistical analysis . in this paper",
    ", we will examine the lf of the young star cluster system in the antennae .",
    "it seems clear that not all bright knots in the ngc 4038/39 system with its still ongoing starburst will probably be gcs , in particular those with large effective radii r@xmath10 might rather be open clusters or associations . therefore , after age dating the clusters in sect .",
    "2 . , we subdivide whitmore & schweizer s young star cluster sample into two subsamples containing the small knots and the more extended systems , respectively ( sect .",
    "3 . ) . in a first step , we assume a uniform age for the ysc population and we model the evolution of the yscs lf over a hubble time and compare to lfs of the milky way s and other nearby galaxies gcss ( sect.4 . ) . in an ongoing starburst like in the antennae ,",
    "the age spread among the yscs may not be negligible ( see also meurer 1995 ) . to examine the age spread effects on the lf we determe individual ages for all star clusters from their ( v - i ) colour and discuss the star clusters age distribution in sect .",
    "we calculate the resulting individual fading for all clusters in sect . 6 .",
    "alternative possibilities to subdivide the ysc sample and their consequences are discussed in sect .",
    ". the of a young gcs may not only change by fading but also by dynamical effects as e.g. stellar mass loss within the cluster and/or tidal interaction of a cluster with the galactic potential . for gc populations in non - interacting galaxies ,",
    "these effects were studied by chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) , their results are largely confirmed by the independent and more realistic approach of fukushige & heggie ( 1995 ) . in a recent paper vesperini ( 1997 )",
    "shows that in the milky way potential an initial log - normal mas distribution represents a quasi - equilibrium state that allows to preserve both its shape and parameters during a hubble time of dynamical evolution , even though up to 70 % of the initial cluster population get disrupted .",
    "in case of the antennae , i.e. in a still uncompleted merger with its gravitational potential being highly variable both in space and in time , however , external dynamical effects seem extremely difficult to model . referring ysc luminosities to a common age",
    "allows to recover the mass function of the ysc system when combined with model",
    "we discuss the possible influence of dynamical effects in sect .",
    "8 . and point out the possibility to observationally approach these dynamical effects by intercomparing star cluster populations in interacting galaxies and merger remnants of various ages .",
    "9 . summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the spatial distribution of the yscs @xmath2 and of their properties as derived here @xmath2 will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "details of our photometric evolutionary model can be found in fritze @xmath2 v. alvensleben & burkert ( 1995 , hereafter * fb95 * ) , where it has been used to age - date the young star clusters in ngc 7252 .",
    "similar to ngc 7252 , though less advanced , ngc 4038/39 seems to be a merger of two gas - rich spirals of comparable mass . though not known very accurately ,",
    "the progenitor spirals of the antennae may probably have been of type sc @xmath2 sc as in ngc 7252 on a similar kind of reasoning as in that case .",
    "observations of large amounts of hi within the body of ngc 4038/39 and along its tidal tails are from van der hulst ( 1979 ) , stanford ( 1990 ) report on molecular gas observations .",
    "thus , from the progenitor spiral s ism abundances a metallicity of @xmath13 is estimated for the stars and star clusters formed during the interaction triggered starburst in the antennae .",
    "this estimate would not change by much , if e.g. one of the progenitor spirals were of type sb or sd . as long as no spectroscopic abundance determination is available for young star clusters in ngc 4038/39",
    ", we will have to rely on this rough metallicity estimate .",
    "while a certain metallicity spread among young star clusters formed in the burst can not be excluded , in a first step we will @xmath2 for lack of better knowledge @xmath2 assume that all young clusters have this same metallicity of @xmath14 and we will derive a mean age of the ysc population from their mean @xmath15 colour .    in a second step ,",
    "we release the simplifying assumption that all yscs have the same age and we will derive ages for individual clusters from their @xmath15 to discuss the effect of an age spread among the very young star clusters .    for a mean dereddened @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "ws95 ) , our models give a mean cluster age of @xmath17 yr ( cf .",
    "if the metallicity were as low ( as high ) as @xmath18 ( as @xmath19 ) the clusters would be ascribed ages of @xmath20 yr ( @xmath21 yr )",
    ". these mean ages of the ysc population seem quite compatible with barnes ( 1988 ) dynamical time of @xmath22 yr since the last ( = first ) pericenter .",
    "@xmath23 colours are available for only 48 yscs .",
    "their mean dereddened @xmath24 would lead to a mean age of @xmath25 yr for @xmath11 .",
    "this younger age is not in conflict with our @xmath26 yr from @xmath15 since only the very brightest ysc in u are detected which @xmath2 of course @xmath2 are expected to be the bluest and youngest .",
    "both nuclei of ngc 4038 and 4039 are sites of ongoing or recent strongly enhanced star formation ( e.g. rubin 1970 , keel 1985 ) and contain sufficient reservoirs of molecular gas ( stanford 1990 ) to sustain their starbursts for a while .",
    "a typical burst duration in this kind of gas - rich spiral @xmath2 spiral merger is of the order of @xmath20 yr ( fritze @xmath2 v. alvensleben & gerhard 1994 , bernlhr 1990 , carico 1990 ) .",
    "in the course of mass loss through any mechanism whatsoever during secular evolution , the effective radius of a star cluster can only grow ( cf . sect .",
    "8) . from the observed range of effective radii r@xmath27 pc ( we use h@xmath28 throughout )",
    "it seems clear that not all bright knots in the antennae may be gcs , the more extended ones having a higher probability of being open clusters or associations . here",
    ", we are facing a significant difference to the case of ngc 7252 where from the larger mean age of @xmath12 gyr alone , most objects can be expected to be gcs . and indeed , the mean effective radius of the ngc 7252 clusters is @xmath29 pc , significantly smaller than the @xmath30 pc of all the antennae s clusters , despite the considerably larger distance to ngc 7252 .",
    "meurer ( 1995 ) argues that @xmath2 due to severe crowding on a bright and spatially variable galaxy background @xmath2 ysc effective radii in distant galaxies may be strongly overestimated .",
    "effective radii are generally determined from the luminosity difference in a small and a larger aperture centered on a ysc , where the large aperture in some cases might be contaminated by light from neighbouring star clusters .",
    "the observed clustering of yscs @xmath2 typically a dozen within one giant hii region ( ws95 ) @xmath2 tends to increase this overestimation of effective radii .",
    "meurer ( 1995 ) estimate the distance out to which this two aperture method should be expected to yield reliable r@xmath10 to be 9 mpc and emphasise that the mean r@xmath10 of yscs in all three starburst galaxies observed to date within this distance is indeed @xmath12 pc , i.e. even smaller than the median r@xmath31 pc of galactic gcs as given by djorgovski & meylan ( 1994 ) .",
    "tidal radii @xmath32 or core radii @xmath33 could not be determined for the antennae s clusters , so no information is available about their concentration parameters + @xmath34 ( @xmath35 before core collapse ) + which are crucial for the question of survival or destruction ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) .",
    "thus , we are left with effective radii as the only discriminating quantity between probable gcs and suspected open clusters ( but see also sects .",
    "4 & 5 ) .    in the following , we devide ws95 s original ysc sample into two subsamples of clusters with r@xmath36 pc , which probably will contain young gcs , and of clusters with r@xmath37 pc , which may contain open clusters or ob associations , but possibly young gcs , too .",
    "galactic gcs have effective radii in the range of 1 @xmath2 25 pc ( djorgovski & meylan 1994 ) .",
    "we chose a delimiting r@xmath10 of 10 pc in order not to have too low a number of objects in the small r@xmath10 subsample .",
    "table 1 compares the mean properties of the two subsamples .",
    "all throughout this paper , numbers after the @xmath38 sign are standard errors .",
    "it is seen that the subsample with r@xmath36 pc has @xmath39 pc as compared to the mean effective radius of galactic gcs of @xmath40 pc , while the subsample with r@xmath37 pc has @xmath41 pc .",
    "furthermore , table 1 shows that clusters with r@xmath36 pc , as compared to clusters with larger r@xmath10 , have slightly larger mean galactocentric distances r@xmath42 , a marginally higher v @xmath2 luminosity ( by 0.16 mag ) , are redder in @xmath15 by 0.02 and in @xmath23 by 0.08 mag with a smaller scatter in their colours .",
    "it is worth noting that if the observed colour difference is interpreted in terms of an age difference , our evolutionary model for @xmath43 indeed indicates a luminosity difference compatible with the one observed . ws95",
    "give an average correction for internal reddening of the yscs of @xmath44 mag .",
    "when compared to our @xmath45 models , the dereddened @xmath46 of the yscs with r@xmath36 pc corresponds to a mean age of @xmath47 yr with an age dispersion ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 yr , while with @xmath50 the clusters with r@xmath51 pc have a mean age of @xmath52 yr with an even larger dispersion ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 yr .",
    "with this mean age and the assumed metallicity the yscs with r@xmath36 pc will redden until an age of 12 gyr ( 15 gyr ) to a @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , respectively ) .",
    "this is significantly redder than the observed @xmath57 of the milky way , andromeda , lmc or smc gcs which are in the range 0.67 @xmath2 0.74 ( harris & racine 1979 ) .",
    "the red @xmath58 is due to the higher mean metallicity of these secondary generation clusters .",
    "gc systems in ellipticals have a mean metallicity typically higher by 0.5 dex than that of spiral galaxy gc systems and are therefore expected to have @xmath59 ( ashman 1995 ) .",
    "the reddest gc system known is that of the hydra cd ngc 3311 with @xmath60 } \\rangle = -0.31 $ ] dex ( secker 1995 ) .",
    "ashman s analysis using worthey s ( 1994 ) models as well as our own models ( fb95 ) suggest a @xmath61 for this extreme gc system , while for the metallicity we assume for the young antennae clusters a @xmath62 is predicted by ashman , close to the 15 gyr value we obtain .    *",
    "to conclude * , all the differences between the two ysc subsamples do not prove but are consistent with a scenario of a global starburst contracting in time with the yscs now observed with r@xmath36 pc formed on average in a slightly earlier and spatially somewhat more extended stage of the starburst with an age spread slightly smaller than that of the clusters with r@xmath51 pc that might still be forming now , at a somewhat later phase in a starburst region that already has contracted towards the center and/or with a star formation efficiency that has decreased at large radii .",

    "it is , however , the faintest bins that may be expected to be most severely depopulated in the course of dynamical evolution ( cf . sect .",

    "this supports our argument in favour of 2 distict episodes of cluster formation separated by a time span of more than 10 gyr .    * in summary * , it turns out that the bright star cluster population detected with wfpc1 in the antennae contains an important fraction of @xmath87 gyr old objects ( 69 out of 550 clusters for which age dating is possible ) most of which seem to be part of the bright end of the original spirals gc population .",

    "the bimodal metallicity distribution we predict for the antennae s gc system will result in a bimodal colour distribution similar to the one found by whitmore ( 1995 ) and elson & santiago ( 1996 ) for the m87 gc system .",

    "no @xmath15 observations are available .",
    "it is seen that the 69 red clusters populate an area within ngc 4038/39 somewhat more extended than the 481 blue ones .",
    "if dust were somehow concentrated to the center , the redder subsample should be less affected by dust than the bluer one , thus increasing the colour difference .",
    "plotted separately as projected on the sky , the blue yscs and the red gcs show very different spatial distributions .",
    "while the blue clusters tightly trace the tidal structure as seen on ws95 s hst image of the antennae , the red clusters show a more spherically symmetric distribution as expected for the original gc population .",

    "the mean effective radius of the red subsample is slightly smaller than that of the bluer clusters .",
    "if they are really old this can be understood in terms of a preferential destruction of large r@xmath10 clusters strong enough to overcome the increase in r@xmath10 caused by internal stellar mass loss ( @xmath161 in r@xmath10 ) and mass loss through tidal stripping ( cf . sect .",
    "the difference in r@xmath10 is surprisingly small , however , in view of our expectation that the old star cluster population should consist of gcs while the blue and young star population might comprise open clusters and ob associations , as well .",

    "it is clear that the old objects must almost all be globulars , even those with @xmath164 pc , except for a small number of very old open clusters as reported for the milky way by friel ( 1995 ) . among the old gc population",
    "the number ratio of objects with @xmath163 pc to those with @xmath164 pc is 23/46 while among the ysc population it is 178/303 .",

    "while the blue yscs trace the tidal structure , the red clusters rather show a spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "interestingly , the mean as well as the distribution of * effective radii are not significantly different for the bright end of the old gc population and for the less than 1 gyr old young star cluster population * which might be expected to also comprise an unknown fraction of open clusters and ob associations together with young gcs .      in figs .",

    "there is another plausible criterion to subdivide the ysc sample of ws95 into a subclass that might be expected to contain a significant number of young gcs as opposed to the rest of the sample that could possibly be dominated by open clusters and associations , and this is luminosity .",
    "one might conjecture that the most luminous objects might be young globulars while the fainter ones could also be open clusters / associations . to explore this hypothesis",

    "the fainter clusters , on average , seem to have larger galactocentric distances .",

    "all differences between the bright and faint subsamples increase if we chose a brighter limiting magnitude for our subdivision .",
    "the bright clusters have a mean age of their young population of @xmath170 yr , younger by almost a factor of 2 than that of @xmath171 yr for the fainter ones . in the age distribution of the bright subsample",
    "the vast majority of clusters is young , only 24/331 are 3 @xmath2 12 gyr old .",

    "however , the brighter subsample will keep a brighter final luminosity @xmath174 mag than the fainter subsample which will end up with @xmath175 mag . as shown in fig .",
    "8 , after 12 gyr , the lf for the bright subsample clearly shows a turn - over definitely brighter than the completeness limit and does closely resemble the gaussian lf of gcs with typical parameters @xmath176 mag , @xmath177 mag rather than the exponentially increasing lf of open clusters .",
    "the fact that this turn - over is slightly brighter than the one we expect on the basis of our metal prediction @xmath2 if it is true @xmath2 might indicate that a limiting magnitude @xmath178 is still so bright as to exclude part of the young gc population .",

    "it has marginally smaller @xmath182 than the bright one .",
    "unless errors of the effective radii are systematically different for the bright and faint subsamples , the larger @xmath183 of the bright sample seem to reflect an initial correlation of larger radii for higher luminosity clusters that overcomes the age effect of increasing the radius due to mass loss .",
    "the lf of the subsample of clusters brighter than @xmath167 mag evolved over 12 gyr closely agrees with a typical gc system s lf ( @xmath3 mag , @xmath177 mag ) , provided age spread effects are properly accounted for .",

    "the antennae are close enough to even identify the brightest members of the original gc population on these aberrated images . ws95",
    "expect reobservations with wfpc2 to go deeper by 2@xmath23 mag .",
    "if this is true and the completeness limit can really be pushed down that far we might be able to observe beyond the turn - over of the original gc population .",
    "then both the old gc population and the ysc population can directly be compared .",
    "it would be very interesting to have spectroscopy for some of the clusters to settle their metallicity range and to allow for better age - dating . at the same time",
    ", ysc spectra will provide information about the local dust distribution and , if spectral resolution allows , also about the kinematics of the ysc system .",
    "the very youngest star clusters will give us the chance to directly study the upper imf .",
    "it is generally accepted that an old gcs , as e.g. observed in the milky way , only encompasses `` the hardiest survivors of a larger original population '' ( harris 1991 ) .",
    "fall & rees ( 1977 ) were the first to discuss the erodive effect on a gcs through its environment .",
    "ostriker ( 1988 ) lists a number of @xmath2 partly interrelated @xmath2 processes , that modify star cluster properties and decimate the original cluster population .",
    "dynamical effects are conveniently distinguished into internal dynamical effects due to stellar mass loss and external dynamical effects from the parent galaxy potential .",
    "the most important external dynamical effect for clusters in the antennae is probably tidal shocking of clusters near the center and of clusters on highly eccentric orbits that pass close to the high density central parts of the merging system , in particular , if the antennae is to evolve into a high central density elliptical or s0 - like merger remnant .",
    "tidal shocking leads to evaporation and is strongest for low concentration clusters , which , in turn , tend to be those with lower luminosity ( djorgovski 1991 ) . dynamical friction , as well , may remove clusters near the center , and this process preferentially acts on the massive ones .    for gc populations in non - interacting galaxies ,",
    "these effects were studied by chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) , their results are largely confirmed by the independent and more realistic approach of fukushige & heggie ( 1995 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is the concentration parameter    c : = log r@xmath184/r@xmath185 (= log r@xmath184/r@xmath10 before core collapse )    that @xmath2 besides the orbital parameters @xmath2 plays the key role for the question of survival or destruction of a star cluster . due to the fact that tidal radii are not accessible observationally the concentration parameters of yscs as well as those of the old gcs in merger remnants like the antennae remain unknown .",
    "an estimate of c from correlations to other quantities ( eg . luminosity ) as found in observations on * old * gcss does not seem reasonable since it is not clear to what extent these correlations reflect intrinsic trends already present when these gcss were young or else are , themselves , the result of dynamical effects .",
    "recent semianalytic modelling of the galactic gcs by vesperini ( 1997 ) yields the interesting result that @xmath2 provided `` the mass function is initially taken to be a log - normal distribution similar to the one currently observed in our galaxy , its shape is not significantly altered during the entire evolution even though a significant number of clusters are disrupted before one hubble time '' .",
    "if the same were true in the case of the merging pair of the antennae galaxies , it would mean that the lf should not change its shape @xmath2 beyond what we found from the proper consideration of age spread effects @xmath2 during 12 gyr of dynamical evolution allthough a significant number of clusters will be destroyed .",
    "the process of referring the lf to a uniform age of the ysc system , as we have done in fig .",
    "6a properly accounting for age differences in the presently observed ysc population mimics a transition from a lf to a cluster mass function since at fixed age models indicate a fixed m / l for all yscs .",
    "6a thus shows that the mass function of the ysc system currently forming in ngc 4038/39 is similar to a gaussian , which , according to vesperini s results seems to represent a sort of quasi - equilibrium distribution capable of surviving a hubble time with its shape and parameters conserved .",
    "all these external dynamical effects are already difficult to model in a galaxy for which the potential is comparatively easy to describe and not variable in time .",
    "it seems extremely difficult , however , to model them in a quantitative way in an ongoing merger like the antennae .",
    "kinematic information from ysc spectroscopy with 10 m class telescopes together with a detailed dynamical modelling of the interaction process including gas dynamics and a sf criterion may bring further insight .",
    "internal dynamical effects are easier to estimate since they only weakly depend on the external tidal field and they are important since the dynamical evolution of young gcs is dominated by adiabatic mass loss due to stellar evolution ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 )    in addition to the photometric evolution , our models also give the mass ejection rates from stars as a function of time including stellar winds , sne , and pne .",
    "thus , they allow to directly follow the time evolution of the total stellar mass of a star cluster . in fig .",
    "9 , we present the time evolution of the relative fraction of stellar mass lost from a star cluster with a scalo ( 1986 ) or salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , a lower mass limit of 0.1 m@xmath186 and various upper mass limits and initial metallicities .",
    "for the case of a scalo imf , the time evolution of the mass loss rate can be well approximated by two linear regimes : a relative mass loss of about 2% per @xmath187 yr during the first @xmath188 yr , and of 1% of the total mass per gyr over the rest of the hubble time .",
    "within the first @xmath188 yr , @xmath189 of the total mass loss occurs , during the first gyr @xmath190 of the final mass loss is accomplished .",
    "these results confirm the idea that most of the young gcs that are going to be destroyed over a hubble time will not even survive their first gyr ( freeman 1995 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .    for comparison , we have also calculated models with upper mass limits of 10 and 60 @xmath191 and we do not find any significant differences in the mass loss rates .",
    "also , differences for clusters of various initial metallicities are small ( cf . fig .",
    "9 ) .    as compared to a scalo imf , a salpeter imf with the same normalisation to total mass contains more stars above 6.5 @xmath192 and below 0.5 @xmath192 .",
    "the latter ones , however , do not contribute to mass loss as their lifetimes are longer than a hubble time . at the same time",
    ", a salpeter imf contains less stars in the range 0.5 @xmath2 6.5 @xmath192 . for both types of imf",
    "the total mass loss over a hubble time is dominated by stars @xmath193 , more massive stars only account for @xmath194 % of the total mass loss .",
    "this explains why for a salpeter imf with same lower and upper mass limits , the total mass loss is less than for a scalo imf . by the end of the first gyr ,",
    "a cluster with scalo imf has lost @xmath195 % of its mass , with salpeter imf only @xmath196 % .",
    "after 3 gyr a scalo cluster has lost @xmath197 % and a salpeter cluster @xmath198 % of its mass through internal stellar evolutionary processes .    to maintain virial equilibrium , a star cluster s effective radius increases by the same percentage by which its mass decreases .",
    "the core collapse and subsequent reexpansion processes ( cf .",
    "bettwieser & fritze 1984 ) do not significantly affect the effective radius of a star cluster , they merely decouple the core radius from the effective radius .      if , as suggested by the similarity of gcss in galaxies of very different hubble types , luminosities and metallicities , the formation process of gcs does not strongly depend on details of environmental conditions , comparison of ysc systems in starbursts of different ages may offer the possibility to follow the time evolution of ysc properties and to study from an observational point of view the influence of dynamical effects on a ysc population which otherwise are difficult to model in the case of ongoing or recent galaxy mergers .",
    "using our method of evolutionary synthesis for various metallicities we present a first analysis of ws95 s wfpc1 data on bright star clusters in the ongoing merger - induced starburst in ngc 4038/39 . assuming a metallicity z @xmath199 on the basis of the progenitor spirals ism properties and applying a uniform reddening as given by ws95 we age - date the bright cluster population from their ( v@xmath2i ) colors and , as far as available , also from their ( u@xmath2v ) .",
    "it turns out that in addition to a large population of young clusters with a mean age of @xmath47 yr ( consistent with the dynamical time since pericenter ) part of the original spirals old gc population is also observed .",
    "a key question with far - reaching consequences as to the origin of elliptical galaxies is whether there are a significant fraction of young gcs among the ysc population .",
    "two basic properties discriminate open clusters / ob associations from gcs in our galaxy and others : the concentration parameter c = log ( @xmath200 ) and the lf which , in contrast to that for an open cluster system , is gaussian for * old * gcss .",
    "tidal radii and , consequently , concentration parameters not being accessible to observations in distant galaxies we examine the lfs of cluster subsamples with large and small effective radii .    in a first step , using a common mean age for all young clusters and a corresponding uniform fading to an age of @xmath87 gyr we find that while the lf for extended clusters at 12 gyr is definitely not gaussian , that for the low r@xmath201 clusters may well contain a gaussian (= gc ) subcomponent together with a strong overpopulation of the faint bins , which themselves , however , might be expected to be severely depopulated over a hubble time by dynamical effects not included in our models .",
    "since for an ongoing starburst the age spread among yscs may be of the same order as their ages , age spread effects are expected to reshape the lf .",
    "clusters from the bright end tend to be younger on average and fade more than clusters from the faint end .",
    "we therefore , in a second step , model the individual fading consistent with individual ages of the yscs as derived from their @xmath15 and @xmath23 colours , and we follow the lf changing its shape over a hubble time .",
    "surprisingly , accounting for these age spread effcets , we find the final lfs of large * and * small r@xmath202 cluster subsamples not to be significantly different any more .",
    "instead , the lf of * all * yscs evolved to a common age of 12 gyr is well compatible with a `` normal '' gclf .",
    "its turn - over occurs at @xmath203 mag , i.e. slightly fainter than the average value @xmath204 mag for 16 galaxies .",
    "this difference is readily explained in terms of a higher metallicity of the secondary cluster population .",
    "strikingly , neither the mean nor the distribution of effective radii is significantly different for the old gc sample and for the ysc sample .",
    "on the basis of these wfpc1 data we tentatively conclude that the bulk of the ysc population detected in the antennae might well be young gcs and that the open clusters / associations probably also present among the yscs do not seem to systematically differ from young gcs in terms of r@xmath202 .",
    "we are looking foreward to repeat this kind of analysis on wfpc2 data which may reach close to the old gcs s turn - over , reveal a number of fainter young objects , and will allow for more precise and definite conclusions .",
    "dynamical effects that eventually might further reshape the lf over a hubble time are discussed . referring the yscs luminosities to a uniform age",
    "allows to recover the intrinsic mass function of the ysc system .",
    "this mass function seems to be log - normal which , according to vesperini ( 1997 ) , represents a quasi - equilibrium distribution that is going to be preserved in shape though not in number of clusters over a hubble time of dynamical evolution .",
    "dynamical effects , however , are extremely difficult to model in detail in an ongoing merger .",
    "comparison of ysc populations in mergers / starbursts of various ages seems a promising tool in an attempt to understand these effects from an observational side .",
