    "the muonic wave function has a large overlap with the binding nucleus .",
    "precision measurements of muonic transitions to deeply bound states can therefore reveal nuclear structure information such as finite size , deformation , surface thickness , and polarization .",
    "the first x - ray spectroscopy of muonic atoms was performed in 1953 using a 4-meter cyclotron @xcite . today , large - scale facilities like triumf ( vancouver , canada ) or psi ( villingen , switzerland ) exist which are specialized in the efficient generation of muons and muonic atoms @xcite .",
    "new developments aim at the production of radioactive muonic isotopes for conducting spectroscopic studies on unstable nuclear species @xcite .",
    "muons bound in atoms are also able to catalyze nuclear fission @xcite and fusion @xcite reactions",
    ".    on a different front , the field of laser - nuclear physics is emerging @xcite .",
    "while lasers have always represented important tools for nuclear spectroscopy @xcite , in recent years their role is changing qualitatively and growing because of the tremendous progress in high - power laser technology .",
    "the interaction of intense short laser pulses ( @xmath3w/@xmath4 ) with matter can produce highly energetic electrons , protons and photons ( e.g. , via bremsstrahlung ) . in pioneering experiments ,",
    "this has led to the observation of laser - induced nuclear fission @xcite , nuclear fusion @xcite , and neutron production in nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "advanced laser sources might also pave the way to nuclear quantum optics @xcite and coherent @xmath2-spectroscopy using ultrashort pulses @xcite .    in light of this ,",
    "the combination of muonic atoms with intense laser fields opens promising perspectives .",
    "contrary to the traditional spectroscopy of muon transitions between stationary bound states , the exposure of a muonic atom to a strong laser field renders the problem explicitly time - dependent and the muon , thus , a _",
    "dynamic _ nuclear probe . in this setup",
    ", the muon is coherently driven across the nucleus which , for example , gives rise to the emission of radiation and , in general , allows for time - resolved studies on a femtosecond scale .",
    "the information on the nucleus gained by laser - assistance can in principle complement the knowledge obtained from the usual field - free spectroscopy of muonic atoms .    against this background",
    ", we have recently considered the process of high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) from strongly laser - driven muonic hydrogen and deuterium atoms @xcite .",
    "the process of hhg represents a frequency up - conversion of the applied laser frequency due to a nonlinear coupling of the atom with the driving external field ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "it can be understood within a three - step model , where the bound lepton is liberated from the atom by tunneling ionization , propagates in the laser field , and finally recombines with the core , returning its kinetic energy upon photoemission . by way of a comparative study",
    "it was demonstrated that the harmonic response from muonic hydrogen isotopes is sensitive to the nuclear mass and size @xcite .",
    "this shows that muonic atoms subject to strong laser fields can reveal information on nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "muonic deuterium molecules in superintense laser fields represent another interesting example towards this combined effort , where field - induced modifications of muon - catalyzed fusion have been investigated @xcite .",
    "muonic hydrogen atoms have moreover been studied as systems which could allow for observation of the unruh effect @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous study on hhg @xcite to hydrogenlike muonic atoms ( ions ) with nuclear charge number @xmath5 . to this end , the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the presence of the binding nucleus and a few - cycle laser pulse is solved on a numerical grid in one spatial dimension . from the resulting dipole acceleration the hhg spectrum is extracted and compared for different isotopes .",
    "characteristic effects arising from the finite nuclear mass and size are revealed .",
    "moreover , in the case @xmath1 the laser - driven particle dynamics becomes more complex because the center - of - mass of the atomic constituents does not stay at rest any longer . as a result",
    ", an effective muon charge appears in the schrdinger equation for the relative motion , which affects the harmonic cutoff position .",
    "the cutoff energies achievable with muonic atoms in the nonrelativistic domain of interaction are very large , reaching several mev .",
    "this holds in principle prospects for the production of coherent @xmath2-ray pulses of ultrashort duration .",
    "since muonic atoms are tightly bound systems , laser fields of extraordinary field strength and photon energy are required to influence the muon motion . in the ground state of muonic hydrogen , for example",
    ", the muon is bound by 2.5kev and experiences a binding coulomb field strength of @xmath6 v / cm corresponding to the field intensity @xmath7 w/@xmath4 .",
    "a comparison of these numbers with the parameters of the most advanced present - day and near - future laser sources is useful . in the range of optical and near - infrared frequencies ( @xmath8ev ) , the highest intensity presently attainable",
    "is @xmath9w/@xmath4 @xcite and the next generation of high - power lasers aims at intensities of @xmath10w/@xmath4 and beyond @xcite . in the vuv frequency domain ( @xmath11ev )",
    "a maximum intensity of @xmath12w/@xmath4 has been attained with a free - electron laser at the flash facility ( desy , germany ) @xcite .",
    "the linac coherent light source ( slac , stanford ) has recently entered the frequency domain @xmath8kev @xcite .",
    "near - future upgrades of such machines are planned to produce brillant x - ray beams ( @xmath13kev ) with peak intensities close to @xmath14w/@xmath4 .",
    "there are also efforts to generate ultrashort , high - frequency radiation ( @xmath15ev ) from plasma surface harmonics where considerably higher intensities might be reachable due to a high conversion efficiency @xcite . with these novel sources of intense coherent radiation it will become possible to influence the quantum dynamics of light muonic atoms with nuclear charge numbers @xmath16 .",
    "note that in principle the laser field strengths and frequencies experienced by the atoms can be enhanced further when a relativistic atomic beam is employed instead of a fixed target @xcite .    as to their lifetime",
    ", we point out that light muonic atoms and molecules may be regarded as quasistable systems on the ultrashort time - scales of strong laser pulses ( @xmath17ps ) , since their life time is determined by the free muon life time of 2.2@xmath18s . for the field parameters assumed in this paper ,",
    "the influence of the external laser field on the muon decay is immaterial as well @xcite . in deeply bound states of heavy atoms",
    ", the muon life time can be reduced due to absorption by the nucleus to @xmath19s which still exceeds typical laser pulse durations by orders of magnitude .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : section ii deals with the theoretical framework in which the separation into center - of - mass and relative coordinates of the two - body schrdinger equation for a hydrogenlike muonic atom in a laser field is performed .",
    "we also give here a scaling transformation between ordinary and muonic atoms , as well as suitable model potentials which allow us to incorporate the nuclear mass and size .",
    "section iii has been reserved for the presentation of our numerical results and their discussion .",
    "while sec.iii.a compiles the harmonic cutoff energies available from different low-@xmath0 muonic atoms , sects.iii.b and iii.c show a series of calculations devoted to the impact of the nuclear mass and size on the hhg spectra .",
    "a comparison of the nuclear signatures predicted for muonic atoms with those to be expected in highly - charged electronic ions is undertaken in sec.iii.d .",
    "the conclusion of the paper is given in sec.iv .",
    "we consider the nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of an initially bound muon in a few - cycle laser pulse described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . for our laser parameters of interest",
    ", we may ignore the space dependence of the laser field ( dipole approximation ) , treating it as a purely time - dependent electric field . due to the large muon mass ,",
    "the atomic nucleus can not be considered as infinitely heavy .",
    "we therefore start from the two - particle tdse written in the length gauge as :    @xmath20\\psi \\left(\\textbf{x}_{\\mu},\\textbf{x}_{n};t\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the muonic and nuclear masses , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the coordinate vectors for the muon and the nucleus , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 the corresponding momentum operators , respectively . besides , the nuclear charge number is @xmath0 , the elementary charge unit @xmath27 , the binding potential @xmath28 , and the laser electric field @xmath29 which oscillates with angular frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the application of the dipole approximation in eq.([tdse2 ] ) considerably simplifies the problem as it renders the schrdinger equation ( [ tdse2 ] ) for the muon - nucleus two - body system separable into relative and center - of - mass motion . by introducing relative and center -",
    "of - mass coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , with the total mass @xmath33 , one finds that the evolution of the center - of - mass is described by @xmath34\\psi\\left ( \\textbf{x},t\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath35 .",
    "equation([cmse ] ) is the non - relativistic volkov equation for a particle of charge @xmath36 and mass @xmath37 in the presence of a laser field . as a consequence , the",
    "center - of - mass motion does not emit higher harmonic frequencies and may therefore be ignored in the following .",
    "note that in the special case @xmath38 ( i.e. , hydrogen isotopes ) the center - of - mass moves freely , while the laser field only couples to the relative coordinate @xcite .",
    "the relative motion is governed by ( see also @xcite ) @xmath39\\psi \\left(\\textbf{x},t\\right)\\ ] ] with the reduced mass @xmath40 , the relative momentum @xmath41 , and the effective charge @xmath42 in the special case @xmath38 , the effective charge reduces to @xmath43 , whereas @xmath44 holds for atomic numbers @xmath1 .",
    "formally , eq.([rse ] ) is the schrdinger equation for a single particle of charge @xmath45 and mass @xmath46 in the presence of a nucleus and a laser field .",
    "the accelerated motion of the relative coordinate in the combined external fields therefore gives rise to the emission of higher harmonics .",
    "we note that , in physical terms , the relative coordinate accounts for the fact that both the nucleus and the muon oscillate in the laser field with different amplitudes in opposite directions ( see also fig.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that the effective charge in eq.([qeff ] ) has already been derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was also shown there that the two - body tdse in a laser field separates straightforwardly in the velocity gauge .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in contrast , the separability in the length gauge is a more subtle issue because the operations of performing gauge transformations and dipole approximations are not commutative @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "cross terms appear in the exact version of the two - body tdse in the length gauge which , strictly speaking , prevent the equation from being separable .",
    "the cross terms typically become important at the borderline to the relativistic regime when the value of the relativistic field parameter [ see eq.([rp ] ) ] approaches unity @xcite . for the nonrelativistic laser parameters applied in the present study ,",
    "however , these terms are very small and have therefore been neglected in eq.([tdse2 ] ) .      the form of eq.([rse ] ) is equivalent to the schrdinger equation for an ordinary hydrogen atom ( i.e. , an electron bound to an infinitely heavy proton ) in a laser field .",
    "the relation can be made explicit by virtue of a general method known as scaling transformation .",
    "for the special case of a laser - driven atom , the scaling procedure is nicely explained in @xcite .",
    "suppose , that we have a hydrogenlike muonic system of nuclear charge @xmath0 on the one side and an ordinary hydrogen atom on the other side .",
    "we introduce an electronic coordinate vector @xmath47 and time @xmath48 and relate them to the muonic coordinate @xmath49 and time @xmath50 of eq.([rse ] ) according to @xmath51 with the mass ratio @xmath52 and the electron mass @xmath53 . when rewritten in the scaled space and time , eq.([rse ] ) becomes @xmath54\\psi \\left(\\textbf{x}_{e},t_{e}\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath55 and the scaled laser frequency and field strength @xmath56 this means that a muonic hydrogenlike atom in a laser field with parameters @xmath57 and @xmath30 behaves like an ordinary hydrogen atom in a field with @xmath58 and @xmath59 given by eq.([scaling ] ) , provided that the binding potential @xmath60 arises from a pointlike nucleus . to give an example ,",
    "the typical parameters of an intense ti : sapphire laser @xmath61ev , @xmath62v / cm ( @xmath63w/@xmath64 ) translate to a muonic helium atom as @xmath65kev , @xmath66v / cm ( @xmath67w/@xmath64 ) .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that , despite the huge laser intensities applied in our computations , the laser - driven muon dynamics remains nonrelativistic due to the large muon mass .",
    "moreover , since the laser intensities required for hhg from muonic atoms are very large already for hydrogen isotopes and steeply increase with the nuclear charge , we restrict our consideration to muonic atoms with @xmath16 .",
    "an advantage of these systems as compared to heavier ones is that the relative differences in mass and size among isotopes are larger for low-@xmath0 atoms in the nuclear chart .",
    "we emphasize that the scaling procedure does not account for nuclear properties like the finite nuclear size or the nuclear shape .",
    "evidently , when the transition from , e.g. , a muonic hydrogen atom to an ordinary hydrogen atom is performed , the proton radius is not to be length - scaled in accordance with eq.([xete ] ) but remains fixed . as a consequence , for atomic systems where nuclear properties play a role ,",
    "not all physical information can be obtained from the knowledge of the ordinary - atom case via scaling . in sec.iii.c below we show results which display the influence of the nuclear size on the process of hhg .      since we restrict ourselves to the consideration of the interaction regime where the dipole approximation applies , we can further simplify the problem by reducing the dimensionality .",
    "we only treat the muon motion in one dimension ( 1d ) along the laser polarization axis .",
    "this is indicated , as in our case the 1d numerics still is a non - trivial task because of the fine grid spacing required to resolve the nuclear extension and the non - standard laser parameters employed . as regards ordinary atoms , the latter would correspond to intense fields in the mid - infrared , giving rise to large muon momenta and ponderomotive energies .",
    "1d models are widely used in strong - field physics @xcite as they retain the essential physical features of nonrelativistic laser - atom interaction for linearly polarized fields @xcite .",
    "the main shortcoming of the 1d approach is the neglect of the muon s wave packet spreading in transversal direction . during one laser period @xmath68",
    ", the spreading can be estimated as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the velocity width at the exit of the potential barrier which the muon tunnels through @xcite and @xmath71 denotes the atomic ionization potential . in an ultrastrong vuv field",
    "( @xmath72 w/@xmath4 , @xmath73 ev ) we obtain @xmath74 pm for muonic hydrogen , which is by a factor @xmath75 smaller than the spreading of an electron wave packet in an appropriately scaled infrared laser field [ cf .",
    "eq.([scaling ] ) ] .",
    "the wave packet spreading can substantially reduce the total harmonic yield .",
    "we stress , however , that the goal of the present study is to reveal _ relative _ differences between physical observables which typically are less sensitive to model assumptions than absolute numbers .    in order to unveil the effects of the nuclear mass and size in the hhg spectra of muonic atoms we employ the following potentials in the 1d version of eq.([rse ] ) :      numerical calculations in reduced dimensionality usually employ a soft - core potential to describe the muon - nucleus interaction @xcite . in this manner",
    ", the coulomb singularity of a pointlike nucleus at the origin is avoided .",
    "we also apply a standard soft - core potential in our computations , which after appropriate scaling reads @xmath76 it enables us to study the influence of the nuclear mass , which enters eq.([sc ] ) via the reduced mass contained in the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in sec.iii.b .      in order to describe the effect of the finite nuclear extension ,",
    "the softcore potential ( [ sc ] ) is not suitable .",
    "instead , we apply for this purpose the nuclear drop model and consider the nucleus as a sphere of uniform charge density within the nuclear radius @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding potential is @xmath78 which explicitly takes the nuclear radius into account .",
    "we point out that in the limit @xmath79 , the binding energy of the lowest lying state of this potential becomes infinite and , thus , unphysical @xcite .",
    "following a well - established procedure @xcite , we therefore start our calculation from the first excited state which has the correct binding energy . by monitoring the projection onto the unphysical state during the time evolution ,",
    "we take care that the occupation of this state always stays negligibly small .",
    "the tdse ( [ rse ] ) for the relative motion has been solved numerically in one spatial dimension via the crank - nicolson time - propagation scheme .",
    "the laser field is always chosen as a 5-cycle pulse of trapezoidal envelope having one cycle for linear turn - on and one for turn - off .",
    "the hhg spectrum is obtained from a fourier transformation of the dipole acceleration .",
    "since the conversion efficiency into high harmonics is rather low ( @xmath80 ) , it is generally desirable to maximize the radiative signal strength .",
    "in our situation , the optimization is of particular importance as the target density of muonic atoms is low .",
    "a sizeable hhg signal requires efficient ionization on the one hand , as well as efficient recombination on the other hand .",
    "the former is guaranteed if the laser peak field strength lies just below the border of over - barrier ionization ( obi ) where the coulomb barrier is suppressed all the way to the bound energy level by the laser field @xcite . from eq.([rse ] ) we obtain @xmath81 with the fine - structure constant @xmath82 .",
    "efficient recollision is guaranteed if the magnetic drift along the laser propagation direction can be ignored , which limits the relativistic parameter to @xcite @xmath83 the condition ( [ rp ] ) also confirms the applicability of the dipole approximation in eq.([rse ] ) .",
    "the eqs.([obi ] ) and ( [ rp ] ) above define a maximum laser intensity @xmath84 and a minimum laser frequency @xmath85 which are still in accordance with the conditions imposed . at these laser parameters ,",
    "the maximum harmonic cutoff energies are attained , while eqs.([obi ] ) and ( [ rp ] ) guarantee an efficient ionization - recollision process . note , however , that smaller driving frequencies generally lead to reduced harmonic signal strengths because of the more pronounced and unavoidable quantum wave - packet spreading @xcite ( for an exeption to this rule , see @xcite ) . for muonic hydrogen the lowest frequency according to eq.([wmin ] ) lies in the vuv range , @xmath86ev , while the maximum field intensity is @xmath87 w/@xmath4 . at these values",
    ", the harmonic spectrum extends to a maximum energy of @xmath88 mev . for light muonic atoms with nuclear charge number @xmath1 , the achievable cutoff frequencies are even higher , reaching several mevs .",
    "a summary is given in table[tablecutoff ] .",
    "for comparison we note that the highest harmonic cutoff energy which has been attained experimentally with ordinary ( helium ) atoms , amounts to @xmath89kev @xcite ; the corresponding harmonic order at the cutoff was @xmath90 .",
    "higher cutoff energies are difficult to achieve due to the detrimental effects of dephasing @xcite and electron drift motion ; various schemes have been proposed to overcome this obstacle ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "muonic atoms are advantageous in this respect since the large muon mass in principle allows for the generation of mev harmonics in the dipole regime of interaction .    as a result , muonic atoms are promising candidates for the generation of hard x - rays or even @xmath2-rays which might be employed to trigger photo - nuclear reactions .",

    "are chosen in accordance with eqs.([obi])-([wmin ] ) to allow for an efficient ionization - recollision process .",

    "the ponderomotive energy is given by [ see eq.([rse ] ) ] @xmath96 and is , thus , the larger the smaller the reduced mass is .",

    "both particles are driven into opposite directions by the laser field and when they recollide , their kinetic energies add up . in this picture",
    "the higher cutoff energy of the hydrogen atom arises from the larger ponderomotive energy of the proton as compared to the heavier deuteron @xcite .    in the opposite situation",

    "these common features are due to the hardcore potential used , in contrast to the softcore potential ( [ sc ] ) .",
    "in fact , a similar behaviour of the harmonic response was found in @xcite and attributed to so - called non - tunneling harmonics in very steep potentials .",
    "our main focus , however , lies on the relative difference between the two spectra .",
    "the harmonic signal from muonic hydrogen is larger ( by about 50% in the cutoff region ) than that from muonic deuterium .",
    "the reason is that in the case of muonic hydrogen the nuclear radius is smaller which generates a steeper potential near the origin [ see eq.([hc ] ) ] .",
    "this leads to a larger potential gradient in this region which accelerates the atomic dipole according to ehrenfest s theorem @xcite .",

    "when instead the frequency of fig.[fig3a](a ) is kept but the field intensity is decreased down to @xmath132 w/@xmath4 ( @xmath133 w/@xmath4 ) for muonic hydrogen ( deuterium ) , then the harmonic signals only differ by about 10% in the cutoff region , as shown in fig.[fig3a](c ) .    in the case of muonic helium isotopes ,",
    "the harmonic signal from @xmath112he is expected to be larger than that from @xmath111he . for @xmath112he , though containing one more neutron , is a doubly magic nucleus of very compact size ( see table[table ] ) .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by fig.[fig3d](a ) , where a relative difference of about 10% in the cutoff region is observed .",
    "the fact that the difference is reduced in comparison with the muonic hydrogen isotopes can be attributed to the smaller relative difference of the nuclear radii : @xmath134 , whereas @xmath135 . on the other hand , however , the muon comes closer to the binding nucleus when the charge number @xmath0 increases which should enhance the sensitivity to the nuclear size .",
    "this circumstance becomes important when we move on to muonic lithium ( @xmath136 ) . here",
    ", the difference between the harmonic signals from muonic @xmath137li versus muonic @xmath138li amounts to about 20% in the cutoff region [ see fig.[fig3d](b ) ] which is larger than for the helium isotopes although the ratio of the nuclear radii @xmath139 is similar here . in order to facilitate the comparison between helium and lithium , the laser parameters in fig.[fig3d ] were chosen to generate a uniform cutoff position .",
    "finally , a comparison of the radiative responses from muonic @xmath140ne and @xmath141ne at the corresponding field parameters reveals almost identical hhg spectra ( not shown ) .",

    "it is instructive to extend the consideration by varying the nuclear radius artificially in order to gain a more complete picture of the physical mechanisms involved . considering hydrogenic nuclei with charge number @xmath38 and radius @xmath77 increasing from 1fm to 5fm",
    ", we obtain a monotonously decreasing hhg signal , in accordance with the explanation given above regarding fig.[fig3a ] . for neon - like nuclei with @xmath151 , however , a minimum harmonic emission strength arises around @xmath152fm .",
    "when the nuclear extension is artificially enhanced further to @xmath153fm , the hhg signal is growing again ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "this different behavior can be attributed to the atomic ionization potential @xmath71 which significantly decreases in the neon - like case when @xmath77 in eq.([hc ] ) is increased .",
    "note that the atomic bohr radius of hydrogenlike muonic neon amounts to 25fm only , rendering this system more sensitive to strong deviations from a point nucleus .",
    "hence , the probability for tunneling ionization in the laser field , being the first step of hhg , is enhanced which leads to amplified harmonic emission for @xmath154fm .",
    "/s(r_0)$ ] , where @xmath155 denotes the near - cutoff signal strength for nuclear radius @xmath77 and @xmath156fm is the reference value .",
    "we point out that the nuclear size variation shown here largely extends beyond the ne isotopes which exist in nature where always @xmath157fm @xcite . ]    when considering laser - driven recollisions , the de - broglie wavelength of the returning quantum wave packet can be of importance as well .",
    "in fact , for the case of ordinary molecules it has been shown that the electron wavelength can become as small as the internuclear distance within the molecule , causing characteristic diffraction patterns @xcite . in the present case of muonic atoms ,",
    "a similar effect could in principle arise when the de - broglie wavelength of the recolliding muon compares with the nuclear size . however , the wavelength of a muon with a kinetic energy of a few mev ( see table[tablecutoff ] ) amounts to about 50fm which exceeds any nuclear radius substantially and thus prevents diffractive muon - nucleus scattering .    concluding this section , we have shown that the plateau height of hhg spectra from muonic atoms is sensitive to the finite nuclear size .",
    "smaller nuclei within the range of existing isotopes lead to enhanced harmonic emission .",
    "we note , however , that  contrary to the nuclear mass effect in sec.iii.b  the influence of the nuclear size might be overestimated by our 1d hardcore - potential approach as the muon meets the nucleus more often than in the real 3d case . a calculation in higher",
    "dimensionality could provide more accurate quantitative predictions on the nuclear size effect whose physical origin and basic features have been presented here .",
    "finite nuclear size effects  in the absence of any external laser field  have been revealed in high - precision spectroscopy of electron transitions in ( ordinary ) highly charged ions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent experiments ) .",
    "when such ionic systems are exposed to a superintense laser field @xcite , nuclear signatures may be present in their high - harmonic response as well .",
    "it is of interest to compare the expected effects with those found for laser - driven muonic atoms in sec .",
    "iii.c . to this end",
    "we perform a simple analysis which is based on nonrelativistic schrdinger theory ; the relativistic electron motion in highly charged ions is ignored in this rather qualitative discussion .",
    "we assume a hydrogenlike system of nuclear charge number @xmath0 and employ the mass scaling parameter @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( 5 ) , with @xmath158 for a muonic atom and @xmath159 for an electronic ion .",
    "the k - shell bohr radius , binding energy , and coulombic field strength amount to @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , respectively , where @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 denote the corresponding quantities for ordinary hydrogen . the nuclear radius can be approximated roughly as @xmath166 and has a typical relative variation among different isotopes of a few percent ( except for hydrogen vs. deuterium ) .",
    "similar finite nuclear size effects in the hhg spectra can be expected when the ratio @xmath167 has a similar value for two atomic systems that are compared .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , for electronic u@xmath168 ( where @xmath169 ) and muonic he@xmath170 ( where @xmath171 ) .",
    "the above relations imply , however , that the binding energy and electric field strength in the electronic ion are substantially larger than in the muonic atom when both have the same ratio of @xmath172 . as a consequence , the laser frequency and intensity that must be applied to the electronic highly charged ion in order to reveal finite nuclear size effects in the harmonic response , need to be larger than in the muonic atom case . against this background ,",
    "muonic atoms appear as more favorable systems than ordinary heavy ions to study the influence of the nuclear size on the hhg process .",
    "motivated by the sustained progress in the development of powerful laser sources , we have studied the harmonic radiation which is emitted by muonic atoms exposed to high - intensity , high - frequency laser fields .",
    "it was shown that maximum harmonic cutoff energies in the mev domain can be achieved , rendering this species of exotic atoms promising candidates for the generation of ( weak ) ultrashort coherent @xmath2-ray pulses which might be employed to trigger photo - nuclear reactions .",
    "our results demonstrate moreover that strongly laser - driven muonic atoms can , in principle , be utilized to dynamically gain structure information on nuclear ground states via their high - harmonic response .",
    "( 1 ) on the one hand , the harmonic cutoff position extends to larger values for isotopes of smaller mass . for the hydrogen isotopes",
    "this effect is fully explicable in terms of the reduced mass , whereas for atomic numbers @xmath1 an additional contribution stems from an effective muon charge which affects the relative motion generating the harmonics . ( 2 ) on the other hand , the harmonic signal strength additionally depends on the nuclear size , being enhanced for more compact isotopes .",
    "corresponding nuclear size effects in the high - harmonic emission from ordinary highly - charged ions are expected to be less pronounced .",
    "furthermore , we point out that the interaction of a muonic atom with ultrastrong laser fields may lead to excitation of the nucleus .",
    "nonresonant nuclear coulomb excitation has recently been studied when a bound muonic wave packet is driven into coherent oscillations by an external laser field @xcite ; the resulting nuclear excitation probabilities were found to be small , though .",
    "when the laser field is sufficiently strong to ionize the muon as in the hhg scenario , however , the kinetic energy gain in the continuum up to the mev range allows for nuclear excitation upon the muon - nucleus recollision .",
    "corresponding studies of laser - driven electron - impact excitation of the nucleus have been carried out in ordinary atoms and ions @xcite .",
    "it is even conceivable to conduct pump - probe experiments on excited nuclear levels : the periodically driven muon can first excite the nucleus and then probe the excited state and its deexcitation mechanism during a subsequent encounter .",
