    "in recent years an increased attention has been devoted to investigations of molecular motors , also known as motor proteins , that are crucial in many cellular processes @xcite .",
    "they transform chemical energy into the mechanical motion in non - equilibrium conditions . for most of molecular motors their motion along linear molecular tracks is fueled by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) or related compounds .",
    "it was suggested that a different mechanism is employed to power the motion of a protein collagenase along collagen fibrils @xcite .",
    "it probably utilizes the collagen proteolysis , cleaving the filament at specific sites .",
    "as the collagenase molecule is unable to cross the already broken bond , it leads to the biased diffusion along the filament .",
    "however , full understanding of mechanisms of collagenase motion is still not available .",
    "it was proposed that a good description of the collagenase dynamics could be provided by the so - called `` burnt - bridge model '' ( bbm ) @xcite . in this model , the motor protein is depicted as a random walker that translocates along the one - dimensional lattice that consists of strong and weak bonds . while the strong bonds remain unaffected if crossed by the walker in any direction , the weak ones ( termed `` bridges '' ) might be broken ( or `` burnt '' ) with a probability @xmath2 when crossed in the specific direction , and the walker can not cross the burnt bridges again , unless they are restored , which can occur with probability @xmath3 . in refs .",
    "@xcite an analytical approach was developed which permitted us to derive the explicit formulas for molecular motor velocity @xmath4 and diffusion constant @xmath5 for the entire ranges of burning probability @xmath6 and concentration of the bridges @xmath7 which were also confirmed by extensive monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "this theoretical method has been applied to several problems with periodic bridge distribution .",
    "however , the results in @xcite have been obtained only for irreversible bridge burning ( bridge recovery probability was taken to be @xmath8 ) , and also for unbiased random walker between bridges ( equal forward and backward transition rates ) . in present work ,",
    "we generalize our approach to allow for the possibility of bridge recovery as well as unequal hopping rates on the sites between bridges .",
    "it is more realistic to consider systems with reversible action of motor proteins since they are catalysts that equally accelerate both forward and backward biochemical transitions @xcite .",
    "according to our model , we view a motor protein as a random walker moving along an infinite one - dimensional lattice with forward and backward transition rates being @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspondingly , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the lattice spacing size is set to be equal to one .",
    "the lattice is composed of strong and weak bonds .",
    "there is no interaction between the random walker and strong bonds , however crossing the bridge in the forward direction ( from left to right ) leads to its burning with the probability @xmath0 , while the particle moves with the rate @xmath9 .",
    "after the weak link is destroyed , the walker is assumed to be on the right side of it .",
    "when the particle is trying to cross a broken bond , the bridge can be recovered with the probability @xmath1 , while the particle moves to the left with rate @xmath10 .",
    "it is assumed that initially , at @xmath11 , all bridges are intact .",
    "the details of breaking weak bonds in bbm have a strong effect on the dynamic properties of motor proteins @xcite .",
    "there are two different possibilities of bridge burning . in the first variant (",
    "the so called `` forward bbm '' ) , the weak bond is broken when crossed from left to right , but the intact bridge is not affected when the particle moves from right to left . thus the bridge recovery may occur if the walker attempts to cross a burnt bridge from right to left . in the second variant ( named `` forward - backward bbm '' ) , the weak link is destroyed if crossed in either direction @xcite . both variants are identical for @xmath12 , however for @xmath13 the dynamics is different in two burning scenarios , as was shown in @xmath8 case @xcite , although mechanisms are still the same . for reasons of simplicity , below we will only consider forward bbm , even though forward - backward bbm can also be solved using the same method .",
    "[ fig1 ]     there are five parameters that specify the dynamics of molecular motors in bbm : the probabilities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , the concentration of bridges @xmath14 , as well as transition rates @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ". the dynamic properties of the walker are also strongly influenced by the distribution of weak bonds @xcite .",
    "below we will study the case of periodically distributed bridges , when their concentration is @xmath15 and the weak bonds are located between the lattice sites with the coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with integer @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "this description is more realistic for collagenases dynamics @xcite .",
    "the model below will be studied using continuous time analysis as it better describes chemical transitions in motor proteins @xcite .",
    "to find the walker s velocity , we generalize the method used in @xcite ( for irreversible bridge burning , i.e. @xmath8 ) to allow for non - zero probability @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce a probability @xmath19 that the random walker is found @xmath20 sites apart from the last burnt bridge at time @xmath21 .",
