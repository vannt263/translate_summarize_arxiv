    "<S> with the lattice boltzmann method ( using the bgk approximation ) we investigate the dynamics of hele - shaw flow under conditions corresponding to various experimental systems . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the onset of the instability ( dispersion relation ) , the static properties ( characterization of the interface ) and the dynamic properties ( growth of the mixing zone ) of simulated hele - shaw systems . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the role of reactive processes ( between the two fluids ) and we show that they have a sharpening effect on the interface similar to the effect of surface tension .    </S>",
    "<S> viscous fingering occurs in the interfacial region between two fluids with different viscosities when a highly viscous fluid confined between two plates with a narrow gap ( hele - shaw geometry ) is displaced by a fluid with relatively low viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> most theoretical and numerical studies on hele - shaw systems start with darcy s law  @xcite assuming its validity under the simulation conditions , and thereby precluding discrimination between navier - stokes behavior or darcy behavior of the system . with the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) </S>",
    "<S> approach @xcite the discrimination problem can be addressed because the lb method starts with a kinetic theoretical analysis where the macroscopic description is not pre - established .    </S>",
    "<S> while the lb method has now become a standard approach to investigate fingering processes , it has mostly been applied to the formation and growth of a single finger in a channel @xcite . fingering in large systems </S>",
    "<S> have been studied and analyzed with lattice gas automata constructed to simulate porous media @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider fingering in spatially extended hele - shaw systems . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effects of surface tension and reactivity between the two fluids , and we demonstrate their role as determinant factors in the dynamics of the moving interface . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper gives a presentation of the essentials of the method and describes the main results of the work which will be discussed in detail elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the lb equation with the bhatnagar - gross - krook collision operator ( lbgk method ; see e.g. @xcite ) in two - dimensional geometry emulating 3-d flows by introducing a hele - shaw drag term thereby simulating a system with a virtual cell gap in the third dimension . using standard notation , the starting lbgk equation for multicomponent systems reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the label of the component with density @xmath2 and velocity @xmath3 . taking the long wavelength limit of the lbgk equation , </S>",
    "<S> one recovers the phenomenological equations of navier - stokes hydrodynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> additional features can be incorporated in the lbgk equation to account for the physics of the problem to be considered . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce ( i ) an _ interaction potential _ ( initially used to simulate non - ideal fluids @xcite ) for tunable miscibility ( `` surface tension '' ) ; ( ii )  an _ external force _ for the hele - shaw drag term ( a term that can also be used to incorporate tunable gravitational effect in density driven fingering ) , and ( iii ) a _ reactive term _ which quantifies changes in the `` chemical '' nature of the species which are susceptible to react with each other .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(i ) the interaction potential has the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 for @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the modulus of the relative velocity between particles . </S>",
    "<S> the potential enters the dynamics through the modified local velocity @xmath10 with @xmath11 the amplitude ( @xmath12 ) of the interaction term can be tuned from zero ( miscible fluids ) to practically total immiscibility .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) the external force ( here the hele - shaw drag term ) is introduced by a force term which modifies the momentum of species @xmath1 ; the new momentum reads @xmath13 for the classical situation where fluid @xmath14 invades fluid @xmath15 , the tunable drag coefficient is the ratio @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) reactive processes are taken into account by a formulation similar to that used in reaction - diffusion equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall use a typical reactive term @xmath17 for species @xmath14 ( and similarly for species @xmath15 with @xmath18 ) where @xmath19 is the kinetic constant . </S>",
    "<S> this form restricts the reactivity effects to the mixing zone  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the lbgk model sketched above was used for binary fluids ( @xmath20 ) on the @xmath21 square lattice with nine velocities oriented along the lattice axes and the bisecting directions plus a zero speed ( d2q9 model @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were performed on a @xmath22 lattice with the following initial conditions : fluid @xmath14 with lowest viscosity is injected from the upper boundary of the system filled with the highly viscous fluid @xmath15 ; periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the vertical boundaries ; the initial planar interface is perturbed with white noise to trigger the instability . </S>",
    "<S> as time evolves , the highly viscous fluid @xmath15 is displaced by fluid @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the color code used in fig.1 is from dark gray to light gray for @xmath23 so that the pictures show `` dark '' fluid invading from above the system initially filled with `` light '' fluid .    </S>",
    "<S> preliminary simulations were performed with a single phase fluid subject to a density gradient ( @xmath24 ) imposed along the vertical axis ( @xmath25 ) , and the average velocity @xmath26 was measured for various values of the gradient : @xmath26 was found to be a linear function of the pressure gradient ( @xmath27 ) according to darcy s law .    </S>",
    "<S> the top panel in fig.1 illustrates the case of miscible fluids ( @xmath28 in eq.([force ] ) ) where a distinguishable mixing layer can be quantified to measure the mixing length @xmath29 as a function of time @xmath30 for increasing values of the pclet number ( @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the diffusion coefficient ) . in agreement with experimental observation and numerical simulation @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a transition from the short time diffusive regime where @xmath29 scales as @xmath33 with @xmath34 to @xmath35 behavior characteristic of the non - linear regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the middle panel of fig.1 shows the effect of surface tension on the finger topology ( compare with upper panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the amplitude ( @xmath12 ) of the interaction term reduces drastically the width of the mixing layer which eventually vanishes , and the finger wavelength is modified correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> a quantification of this effect is given in fig.2 where we show typical dispersion curves .    </S>",
    "<S> reactive processes between two moving miscible fluids are expected to modify the fingering mechanisms as shown by phenomenological approaches based on a reaction - diffusion scheme @xcite , and experimental studies have indeed demonstrated that the interface properties depend strongly on chemical reactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have implemented a reactive mechanism by incorporating in the lb scheme a reaction term as described in ( iii ) above . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effects are illustrated in the lower panel of fig.1 which shows ( i ) a sharpening of the interfacial zone , and ( ii ) a modification of the topology of the fingering ( compare with top panel ) as quantified by the dispersion curves shown in fig.2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this short paper is to demonstrate the applicability of the lattice boltzmann method to the investigation of viscous fingering phenomena in spatially extended systems . in particular we have shown how surface tension and reactive processes can modify the dynamics and the characteristics of the fingering pattern . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper with a detailed description of the work . </S>"
