    "the spatial clustering of galaxies encodes useful information about their formation and evolution , which remain outstanding problems in modern cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "large redshift surveys at different epochs have enabled detailed studies of galaxy clustering and its evolution . in particular , the dependence of clustering on galaxy properties such as luminosity and color provides fundamental constraints on galaxy formation theories . in this paper , we model the luminosity - dependence of the galaxy two - point correlation functions at @xmath0 and @xmath1 measured for galaxies in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite to investigate the evolution of galaxies over the last @xmath37 billion years .    to make full use of the galaxy clustering measurements to test galaxy formation theories , one needs to extract and characterize the information available in the clustering data in a convenient and informative form . in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "hierarchical structure formation paradigm , the evolution of galaxies is coupled to that of the dark matter halos , defined as roughly spherical , virialized regions with over - density about 200 times that of the mean background density . the formation and evolution of dark matter halos are dominated by gravity and , with the help of improving computational power and @xmath7-body simulations , can be calculated accurately for any specified cosmological model .",
    "galaxy clustering data are particularly illuminating if one can relate galaxies to dark matter halos in a way that results in informative tests of galaxy formation theory .",
    "this can be achieved within the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , which describes the statistical relation between galaxies and dark matter halos ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hod characterizes this relation in terms of the probability distribution @xmath8 that a halo of virial mass @xmath9 contains @xmath7 galaxies of a given type and the relative spatial and velocity distribution of galaxies and dark matter within halos .",
    "contemporary large galaxy surveys , such as the sdss @xcite and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) , enable detailed studies of the @xmath4 galaxy population .",
    "hod modeling , or the closely related `` conditional luminosity function '' ( clf ) method @xcite , has been applied to interpret clustering data from these local surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , much effort has also been placed on studying the clustering of high redshift galaxies , from @xmath10 , such as the deep2 survey @xcite , the combo-17 survey ( classifying objects with medium band observations in 17 filters ; @xcite ) , the ndwfs ( noao deep wide - field survey ; @xcite ) , and the vvds ( vimos - vlt deep survey ; @xcite ) , up to @xmath11@xmath12 in many surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hod / clf modeling has also been used to explain the clustering properties of these high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy clustering data at different redshifts provide a goldmine of information from which to deepen our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "as an example , @xcite find evidence for merging or disruption of red galaxies in ndwfs from modeling the evolution of their clustering .",
    "recent studies of galaxy luminosity functions and two - point correlation functions at different redshifts with the clf approach also reveal some interesting evolutionary trends , such as a brightening of the luminosity of central galaxies at a fixed halo mass toward higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    as galaxies evolve , they grow in both stellar and dark matter mass .",
    "their stellar component continuously changes as the original stars age and new stars form .",
    "galaxies can also change their stellar contents and increase their mass as a result of mergers with other galaxies .",
    "different feedback or pre - heating mechanisms , such as those caused by star formation , active galactic nuclei , or the photo - ionizing ultra - violet background , can also impact at different stages of a galaxy s life .",
    "various evolutionary processes can change galaxy properties such as luminosity , color , mass and morphology . to observationally establish a connection between galaxy populations at different redshifts",
    "is therefore not trivial .",
    "much of the work to identify progenitors or descendants of certain galaxy types from galaxy clustering has been based on rather simple models with limited constraining power , such as the object - conserving or the merging model @xcite . by contrast",
    ", the hod framework converts the observed galaxy clustering data to a relation between galaxies and their host dark matter halos , placing galaxies in a cosmological context . using hod constraints at different redshifts derived from clustering data",
    "thus provides a physically motivated way to study galaxy evolution .",
    "the evolution of the hod reflects how the relation between galaxies and halos changes with time , which can be used to test galaxy formation models in a more transparent way .",
    "the evolution of dark matter halos can be solved with analytic approaches ( e.g. , @xcite ) and cosmological simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the hod evolution may potentially provide valuable constraints on the evolution of baryons in galaxies ( e.g. , accretion and consumption of gas , formation of stars ) and put powerful tests on galaxy formation theories .",
    "many recent studies of galaxy evolution have measured specific galaxy properties ( e.g. , the star formation rate or the star formation history ) as a function of the mass of the galaxy , where either the stellar mass or an estimate of the dynamical mass is used ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the unique aspect of the approaches presented and envisioned in this paper that make use of hod modeling of galaxy clustering at different redshifts is that we are able to study the evolution of galaxy properties as a function of the host dark matter halo mass , which is a fundamental parameter in galaxy formation and evolution .    in this paper",
    "we perform hod modeling of the luminosity dependence of the galaxy two - point correlation function for samples at two epochs , the @xmath0 deep2 galaxies and the @xmath1 sdss galaxies , to study the evolution of the hod and its implication for galaxy formation models .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in ",

    "we define our cosmological model and introduce the hod parameterization in   3 .",
    "the modeling results are presented in ",
    "5 we make a detailed comparison between the hods at the two epochs . in   6 we attempt to establish an evolutionary link between the two galaxy populations through the growth of dark matter halos .",
    "this allows us to infer the evolution of galaxies as a function of the host halo mass during the last @xmath37 billion years .",
    "we also discuss the star formation efficiency at the two epochs . finally , in   7",
    "we summarize our results and discuss how to extend the study in this paper to a powerful , comprehensive program to constrain galaxy formation and evolution theories . for a simple estimate , instead of using a full hod modeling , some applications of galaxy clustering assume one galaxy per halo . in the appendix we use an hod model to investigate the potential systematic errors introduced by this assumption .",
    "we use the projected two - point correlation functions measured by @xcite for luminosity threshold galaxy samples from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to constrain the hod at @xmath13 .",
    "the deep2 survey uses deimos @xcite on the 10-m keck ii telescope to survey optical galaxies at @xmath13 in a comoving volume of approximately 5@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16mpc@xmath17 .",

    "the three brightest samples ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) are volume - limited for blue galaxies , while the faintest sample ( @xmath30 ) is missing some fainter blue galaxies at @xmath31 .",
    "the samples are not entirely volume - limited for red galaxies , due to the @xmath32 selection of the deep2 survey ( for definitions of blue and red galaxies and a discussion of this selection effect see @xcite ) . by assuming little evolution in the red galaxy fraction at @xmath0 and using a volume - limited ( but smaller ) control sample at a slightly lower redshift",
    ", we estimate that , for each sample , about 10% of the full population is missed because of the red galaxies being not volume - limited .",
    "we address the impact of this sample selection on the galaxy evolution we attempt to establish in   [ sec : evolutionlink ] .",
    "we compare the deep2 clustering and modeling results to those obtained from the sdss at lower redshifts .",

    "the angular completeness is characterized carefully for each sector ( a unique region of overlapping spectroscopic plates ) on the sky .",
    "we use here the clustering results presented in @xcite for an sdss sample containing some @xmath36 galaxies extending over @xmath37 deg@xmath21 on the sky .",

    "@xcite have also performed detailed hod modeling of these clustering measurements .",

    "it has proven to be useful to parameterize the hod by separating contributions from central and satellite galaxies , through studies of subhalo hods in high - resolution , dissipationless @xmath7body simulations @xcite and galaxy hods in semi - analytic galaxy formation model ( sa ) and in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations @xcite . for galaxy samples defined by lower luminosity thresholds ,",
    "a simple parameterization of the mean occupation function has three parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the mean occupation function @xmath56 of central galaxies can be represented by a step - like function with a characteristic minimum halo mass @xmath57 , and the mean occupation function @xmath58 of satellite galaxies is approximated by a power law with the amplitude and slope as two free parameters .",
    "this simple three - parameter model can capture the basic features in the mean occupation function predicted by galaxy formation models .    however , there are some advantages in choosing a parametrization more flexible than the simple one . for example , at lower halo mass , the mean occupation function of satellites predicted by galaxy formation models drops faster than the extrapolation of the high mass power law @xcite . since , in the low - mass range , satellites have a substantial contribution to the galaxy two - point correlation function , with the simple three - parameter model , the best - fit power law slope in the satellite mean occupation function tends to reflect the effective slope in the low - mass range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "that is , the overall slope is adjusted to fit the amplitude of @xmath59 in the low - mass range , and it may become a poor description for the slope at high halo mass .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a slightly more flexible parameterization with five parameters , motivated by the results presented in @xcite .",
    "the mean occupation function of the central galaxies is a step - like function with a soft cutoff profile to account for the scatter between galaxy luminosity and host halo mass . that of the satellite galaxies is a power law modified by a low - mass cutoff profile in better agreement with predictions of galaxy formation models .",
    "this more flexible parameterization includes two parameters for the mean occupation function of central galaxies and three for that of the satellite galaxies , which are described in detail below .",
    "the mean occupation function of central galaxies is a step - like function parameterized by @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the error function @xmath62 there are two free parameters : @xmath57 , the characteristic minimum mass of halos that can host central galaxies above the luminosity threshold , and @xmath63 , the width of the cutoff profile .",
    "note that @xmath57 here can be interpreted as the mass of such halos for which half of them host galaxies above the given luminosity threshold , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "it is not identical to those used in three - parameter models ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath65 for an exponential cutoff profile and @xmath66 changes from 0 to 1 at @xmath57 for a sharp cutoff profile .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases , @xmath57 characterizes the minimum mass scales of the host halos . in the three - parameter model , @xmath56 , which uses one parameter @xmath57 ,",
    "can also have a soft cutoff profile , e.g. , an exponential profile as in @xcite .",
    "however , the two parameters @xmath57 and @xmath63 of the cutoff profile in equation  ( [ eqn : ncen ] ) have a more physical meaning . to see this",
    ", we briefly review the derivation of the form of @xmath56 .",
    "the motivation for such a form is the relation between the central galaxy luminosity and the host halo mass predicted by galaxy formation models .",
    "based on predictions of sa and sph galaxy formation models , @xcite show that the distribution of the central galaxy luminosity @xmath67 at fixed halo mass @xmath9 can be described by a log - normal distribution , and here we write it as @xmath68.\\ ] ] in halos of mass @xmath9 , the mean occupation function of the central galaxies above a luminosity threshold @xmath69 is an integration of equation  ( [ eqn : plc ] ) over @xmath70 , and the result turns out to have the same form as equation  ( [ eqn : ncen ] ) but with the argument of the @xmath61 function being @xmath71/(\\sqrt{2}\\sigl)$ ] .",
    "if the mass range of the cutoff profile is not large so that we can approximate the mean luminosity @xmath72 of central galaxies in halos of mass @xmath9 as @xmath73 , it is straightforward to see the meaning of the parameters in equation  ( [ eqn : ncen ] )  @xmath57 is the mass of halos in which the mean luminosity of central galaxies is the luminosity threshold @xmath69 , and the width of the cutoff profile is related to the scatter of the central galaxy luminosity in halos of mass @xmath9 as @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , by studying the hods of galaxy samples with different luminosity thresholds , we would learn the distribution ( mean and scatter ) of central galaxy luminosity as a function of halo mass , from the cutoff profile and the mass scale of @xmath56 .",
    "we follow the above explanation when interpreting our modeling results .    according to predictions from @xmath7body , sa , and sph galaxy formation models @xcite",
    ", the mean occupation function of satellite galaxies @xmath58 approximately follows a power law at the high halo mass end with the slope close to unity . at lower mass , @xmath58 drops steeper than the power - law extrapolation and can be parameterized by @xmath75^\\alpha$ ] , where @xmath76 is the mass scale of the drop , @xmath77 characterizes the amplitude , and @xmath78 is the asymptotic slope at high halo mass .",
    "applying the same cutoff profile of the central galaxies , we assume the following form for the mean occupation of satellite galaxies , for @xmath79 : @xmath80 \\left(\\frac{m - m_0}{m_1^\\prime}\\right)^\\alpha.\\ ] ]    for modeling the two - point correlation function of galaxies , we also need to know the second moment of the occupation number in addition to the mean .",
    "central galaxies simply follow the nearest - integer distribution @xcite , and for satellite galaxies , we assume a poisson distribution that is consistent with theoretical predictions @xcite . the spatial distribution of galaxies inside halos is assumed to be the same as the dark matter that follows the nfw profile , a reasonable assumption on scales we model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "overall , our basic hod parameterization has a total of five parameters  two for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 and @xmath63 ) and three for @xmath58 ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ) .",
    "with respect to the simple three - parameter model used in @xcite , our five - parameter model essentially introduces one additional parameter to @xmath56 and one to @xmath58 to characterize the cutoff profiles at low halo mass .    for theoretical calculations of galaxy two - point correlation functions",
    ", we adopt the method proposed in @xcite , which improves that presented in @xcite by incorporating a more accurate treatment of the halo exclusion effect .",
    "the method is calibrated and tested using mock catalogs and can reach an accuracy of 10% or better in calculating galaxy two - point correlation functions .",
    "more specifically , we adopt the `` @xmath81matched '' approximation ( see their appendix b ) for a more efficient calculation .",

    "the best - fit models for the two brighter samples have a shallow cutoff profile in @xmath149 .",
    "for the two fainter samples , the inferred cutoff profile in @xmath149 can be either sharp or shallow , which leads to the kink seen in the envelope of @xmath149 for models with @xmath147 .",
    "the general trend that the central galaxy cutoff profile is better constrained for brighter galaxies reflects the fact that the halo mass function and bias factor change steeply toward the high mass end , although the residual redshift - space distortion [ because of @xmath142 being derived from a finite projection ] could artificially increase the shallowness of the cutoff profile ( j. l. tinker , private communication ) .",

    "a full implementation of this would require modeling the data from all galaxy samples simultaneously , and there would be strong correlations among mean occupation functions of different samples . here",
    "we choose to model each sample individually . to roughly account for the above condition ,",
    "we drop some models that are in apparent conflict .",
    "specifically , the mean occupation functions of satellites for the @xmath23@xmath150@xmath151 sample from a small fraction of models have a cutoff at much higher mass than those for the @xmath23@xmath150@xmath152 sample , which is not realistic .",
    "we therefore only keep models for the @xmath23@xmath150@xmath151 sample with a satellite cutoff mass of @xmath76@xmath150@xmath153 for the following discussions .",
    "we note that the above consistency condition is automatically satisfied by adopting the clf method , with the hod of each sample obtained by integrating the clf over halo mass , although to reach a similar level of flexibility in the hod we use here , more parameters need to be introduced in the clf .",
    "the high - mass end slopes @xmath78 for mean occupation functions of satellites are found to be @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 in order of increasing luminosity threshold , where each value is quoted as the mean with error bars from the central 68.3% of the marginalized distribution ( i.e. , 1@xmath148 range ) .",
    "although the value for the most luminous sample is slightly larger , all values are close to unity , which agrees with predictions of galaxy formation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the best - fit hod model for the brightest deep2 sample ( @xmath27 ) has a larger @xmath143 than those of the other samples .",
    "much of the difference between the model and the data happens on small scales ( @xmath158 ) . on these scales ,",
    "the raw measurements of @xmath142 are affected by the undersampling of galaxies caused by the slitmask target selection algorithm , and they are corrected by using the mock galaxy catalogs of @xcite @xcite . in general ,",
    "the correction increases the amplitude and the slope of @xmath142 on small scales by a small amount . as a test of the robustness of our hod results to this correction",
    ", we perform an mcmc run with the uncorrected @xmath142 data for this sample and find @xmath159 .",
    "the inferred hod therefore seems to be robust against such a correction  there is almost no change , except for a slight decrease in the number of satellite galaxies in low - mass halos to account for the slightly reduced amplitude and slope of the uncorrected @xmath142 .",
    "the slitmask correction could in principle be improved by using catalogs generated according to the best - fit hod model and iterating the correction and model fitting a couple of times .",
    "however , given the robustness of the best - fit hod under the adopted parameterization , we do not intend to perform such iterations in this paper .",
    "we also tried to fit the data with a more flexible hod parameterization , which uses a spline line for the satellite mean occupation function ( similar to what is used in fig.19c of @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the hod is adjusted to fit almost every feature in @xmath142 , and the modeling may result in solutions that are not seen in galaxy formation models .",
    "for instance , for the brightest @xmath27 sample , the best - fit satellite mean occupation function has an inflection and flattens out toward the low halo mass end , which allows it to fit the high amplitude and steep slope of @xmath142 on small scales that are vulnerable to slitmask corrections .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this more flexible hod parameterization might be `` over fitting '' the data , and that to robustly interpret the present data does not require an hod form more flexible than our five - parameter model .",
    "the modeling results for sdss galaxies using the five - parameter model described in  3.2 are shown in figure  [ fig : wp_hod_sdss ] . to be concise , only the results of the samples that are most relevant to the evolution connection between deep2 and sdss galaxies ( see   [ sec : evolutionlink ] ) are plotted in this figure , although we perform hod modeling for all sdss samples with luminosity cuts ranging from @xmath160 to @xmath161 ( see table 1 ) .    unlike the deep2 samples ,",
    "the cutoff profiles of @xmath56 for the sdss samples are loosely constrained .",
    "this can be partly explained by noticing that in the mass range of @xmath162@xmath153 , both the halo mass function and the halo bias factor at @xmath46@xmath31 are steeper than those at @xmath46@xmath30 , and therefore the galaxy number density and the amplitude of the two - point correlation function at large scales lead to a better constraint in the cutoff profile for deep2 galaxies .",
    "we also note that complete freedom in @xmath63 [ eq .  ( 2 ) ] leads to a strong correlation between @xmath57 and @xmath63 in the sense that larger @xmath57 corresponds to larger @xmath63 , which results in poor constraints on @xmath57 .",
    "we assign a prior @xmath163 , being conservative according to theoretical predictions @xcite , for sdss galaxy samples with luminosity threshold fainter than @xmath2 ( @xmath164@xmath165@xmath166 ) .",
    "the transition scales from one - halo term to two - halo term for sdss samples are around @xmath167 , larger than those for deep2 galaxies .",
    "the cause of such a shift is that the one - halo term for sdss galaxies appears to be shallower than that for deep2 galaxies , which again reflects the change in the slope of the halo mass function in the mass range probed by deep2 and sdss galaxies ( note that , for the halo definition we adopt , at a given mass the comoving sizes of halos at the two epochs are the same ) .",
    "this also explains why the departure of the two - point correlation function from a power law becomes more prominent at higher redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , on the basis of the mcmc results presented in the previous section , we compare the hods of deep2 and sdss galaxies in detail .      as mentioned in   [ sec : hod ] , the low - mass cutoff profile of the mean occupation function of central galaxies encodes information about the distribution of central galaxy luminosities in halos with mass close to the cutoff mass . by modeling the galaxy two - point correlation functions for samples with different luminosity thresholds",
    ", we can derive the distribution of the central galaxy luminosity as a function of halo mass .",

    ", there is an offset of @xmath31.4 in @xmath168 between the deep2 and sdss relations .",
    "however , given that the two samples are selected in different rest - frame bands , this offset does not necessarily imply that @xmath0 deep2 galaxies are more luminous than @xmath1 sdss galaxies at a fixed halo mass .",
    "alternatively , at fixed @xmath168 there is an offset of @xmath169 in halo mass between the deep2 and sdss samples .",
    "similarly , the interpretation of such an offset is not immediately clear . in   [ sec : evolutionlink ] we attempt to establish a more meaningful evolutionary link between galaxies at the two epochs .    because of a large range in galaxy luminosity ,",

    ", a @xmath13 progenitor central galaxy would have @xmath2332.65.3@xmath234 ( higher luminosity for stars forming at higher redshift ) if they were passively evolving to @xmath1 .",
    "this is fainter than the @xmath1 central galaxies ( @xmath230 ) , which implies that additional stars must have been added to the system since @xmath0 , through star formation and/or galaxy mergers .",
    "the connection between luminosities of local central galaxies and their progenitors provides interesting information on the evolution of the stellar component of galaxies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "however , a comparison in terms of stellar mass would be more informative and straightforward to interpret , as stellar mass is a more fundamental physical parameter than luminosity . as with luminosities , the ideal way to make this comparison is to construct stellar - mass - selected galaxy samples and to perform hod modeling of the observed clustering of these samples , which we reserve for a future study . with the luminosity - selected samples used here , we use a simple estimation of stellar mass derived from the galaxy luminosity and color .",
    "while the correlation between stellar mass and galaxy luminosity can have a fair amount of scatter , we attempt here to extract useful information from the _ mean _ relation .",
    "the following analysis is presented as a proof of concept as to how one could attempt to study evolution of galaxies in terms of stellar mass and as a function of halo mass , and it serves only as a useful first - order approximation for analyses of stellar - mass - selected samples . with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "for the deep2 galaxies , stellar masses are derived by @xcite for the subset for which @xmath235-band imaging exists , assuming a chabrier stellar initial mass function ( imf ; @xcite ) .",
    "an empirically - derived relation between rest - frame @xmath236 colors , redshift , and stellar mass is then used to estimate masses for the rest of the deep2 sample ( c. n. a. willmer , private communication ) . for the sdss samples",
    ", we estimate the stellar mass from the @xmath237 color and the @xmath38band luminosity using the relation given by @xcite . the dominant source of uncertainty in estimating stellar mass using the above method",
    "is the imf of stars @xcite .",
    "the `` diet '' salpeter imf @xcite is used for the sdss galaxies .",
    "the effect of different imfs is largely an offset in the estimated stellar mass .",
    "for example , stellar mass with the diet salpeter imf ( chabrier imf ) is 70% ( 50% ) that with the salpeter imf .",
    "we multiply the deep2 stellar masses with the chabrier imf by a factor of 1.4 to convert them to a diet salpeter imf , so that stellar masses from both surveys can be compared .",
    "the mean stellar mass of galaxies and the scatter are calculated in a series of narrow luminosity bins .",
    "we can then convert the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass to that between stellar mass of central galaxies and halo mass . with the present - day central galaxies and their progenitors at @xmath0 linked through the @xmath219@xmath9 relation , we recast figures  [ fig : sdss_deep ] in terms of stellar mass , which is shown in figure  [ fig : mstar ] .",

    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mstarratio ] shows the ratio of the mean stellar masses in the @xmath0 progenitors and the @xmath1 central galaxies as a function of the present - day halo mass , which is expected to be insensitive to the choice of the imf . at @xmath238 , on average ,",
    "a central galaxy had @xmath320% of its present stellar mass in place at @xmath0 .",
    "the ratio gradually increases to @xmath333% around @xmath172 and is roughly constant up to the highest halo mass we can probe . for galaxies that reside in @xmath172 halos ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath229 galaxies ) , the increase in stellar mass from @xmath0 appears to be consistent with the luminosity comparison presented in   [ sec : luminosity_evolution ]",
    "if most stars in their @xmath239 progenitors do not form at a very high redshift and the luminosity is roughly proportional to stellar mass .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mstar]@xmath218 , at @xmath0 , progenitor halos have already reached more than 50% of their total present - day mass .",
    "therefore , in the mass range probed here , halos have most of their mass assembled by @xmath0 but have most of their central galaxy stars assembled / formed more recently .",
    "the mass scale of 12@xmath240 for present - day halos appears to be a transition scale , below which a relatively larger fraction of stars have been added to the central galaxies during the period from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .    in general",
    ", there are two processes that can add stellar components to central galaxies .",
    "one is star formation , and the other is galaxy merging , either merging of satellites with central galaxies or merging of central galaxies in different halos .",
    "the star formation includes that which occurs in the central galaxies and the star formation in the satellite galaxies that eventually merge onto central galaxies .",
    "if we know the halo occupation as a function of stellar mass at @xmath0 , we can evolve the subhalo and halo population at @xmath0 to @xmath1 using high - resolution @xmath7-body simulations or an analytic code ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming no star formation .",
    "such a calculation would give the amount of stars acquired through mergers . the difference between the evolved stellar mass occupation and the true stellar mass occupation in halos of a given mass ( inferred from @xmath4 data )",
    "would tell us the amount of stars formed during the period from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . while the samples we model are not well suited for such a sophisticated analysis , it is a goal we plan to pursue in future work .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ fig : mstarratio ] nevertheless allow us to place interesting limits on the amount of stars added to the present - day central galaxies by star formation and merging , in an average sense .",
    "as seen from figures  [ fig : sdss_deep ] and [ fig : mstarratio ] , for @xmath1 halos with @xmath241 , their @xmath0 progenitors have assembled @xmath370% of the @xmath1 mass while the progenitor central galaxies have @xmath320% of the stellar mass in place . for low - mass halos",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the stellar mass in the progenitor halo is dominated by those from central galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the progenitor halo therefore assembles the remaining @xmath330% mass by @xmath1 through smooth mass accretion and/or merging with one or more smaller halos .",
    "if the fraction of stellar mass inside this additional mass is the same as in the progenitor halo ( i.e. , smaller halos are assumed to have the same star - formation efficiency as the progenitor of the @xmath242 halo ) , then at most @xmath39% of the final stellar mass can be gained by this process .",
    "that is , the stellar mass in the progenitor galaxy and that in the smaller halos that could merge with it or the mass that is accreted can only amount to @xmath330% of the final stellar mass in the @xmath1 central galaxy . therefore , for central galaxies in @xmath1 halos with @xmath243 , @xmath370% of the stars should form between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "similar reasoning can be applied to higher mass halos , but one should keep in mind that the contribution of stellar mass in satellites increases with halo mass . for @xmath4 halos with the highest mass we can probe ( @xmath244 , which host galaxy groups ) , satellite galaxies contribute a substantial amount of the stellar mass in the halo .",
    "the @xmath0 progenitor of an average halo of this mass has assembled @xmath354% of the total mass , and the progenitor central galaxy has @xmath333% of its stellar mass assembled . neglecting star formation",
    ", the progenitor central galaxy can merge with other central galaxies ( with their total halo mass amounting to the remaining @xmath346% of the @xmath1 halo mass ) , and the total contribution to the stellar mass in the final @xmath1 central galaxy from all the merged progenitor central galaxies would be at most 60% .",
    "merging of satellites to the final central galaxy would make an additional contribution to the stellar mass .",
    "we crudely estimate this contribution as follows . in a halo",
    ", satellite galaxies are usually fainter than the central galaxy , and in galaxy groups , the brightest satellites are likely to be @xmath31.6 mag ( @xmath325% ) fainter than the central galaxies ( i.e. , the luminosity gap ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this means that even if all the brightest satellites in halos that are assembled into a @xmath4 @xmath245 halo are able to merge onto the final central galaxy , their contribution to the stellar mass is only about 25% of that from merging of central galaxies .",
    "thus , the total stellar mass from merging of central galaxies and satellites may likely account for @xmath246 of that in the final central galaxies .",
    "the remaining @xmath325% would then be the result of star formation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "using this same line of reasoning , we illustrate in figure  [ fig : contribution ] the different contributions to the @xmath4 central galaxy stellar mass in the halo mass range we are able to probe . in this plot , a linear interpolation in logarithmic halo mass , based on the above limits for the low- and high - mass ends , is assumed to estimate the contribution from satellite mergers . based on these crude estimations ,",
    "we find an interesting result : on average , a large fraction of stars in @xmath1 central galaxies residing in low - mass halos formed since @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xmath370% for @xmath247 halos ) , while only a small fraction of stars formed for central galaxies in high - mass halos ( e.g. , @xmath325% for @xmath248 halos ) over the same period .",
    "this trend seems to be a manifestation of the so - called downsizing  a pattern in which the sites of active star formation shift from high - mass galaxies at early times to lower - mass systems at later epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the trend continues to higher halo mass , beyond the luminosity range we probe in this paper , there may be no substantial star formation occurring between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in very massive halos .",
    "are these estimates reasonable ?",
    "we can compare them to values obtained from the global cosmic star formation history ( e.g. , @xcite ) , probed through different techniques .",
    "using a recent compilation of data in @xcite , we estimate that about 40% of all the stars in the present universe formed between @xmath232 and @xmath54 . based on stellar mass estimates from the combo-17 survey , @xcite find that the total stellar mass density of the universe has roughly doubled since @xmath0 .",
    "these numbers are well bracketed by our values .    the mass dependence of star formation that we find here",
    "can also be compared with other results .",
    "we find that the stellar mass growth rate of central galaxies depends on the host halo mass .",
    "since halo mass and central galaxy stellar mass are closely related , this implies that the growth rate depends on stellar mass itself .",
    "@xcite use spectroscopic modeling to infer the star formation histories of individual sdss galaxies and derive the mean star formation history as a function of galaxy stellar mass . by integrating the fraction of stellar mass in the last 6.8 billion years as a function of stellar mass ( sum of the dotted and all the solid lines in the top panel of their fig.4 ) , we find that for @xmath1 galaxies with stellar mass @xmath249 , @xmath370% of their stars formed between @xmath250 and @xmath1 . this fraction drops to @xmath340% for galaxies with a @xmath1 stellar mass of @xmath251 . using the star formation histories of sdss galaxies estimated by @xcite , which improves on the modeling in @xcite , the above numbers become @xmath360% and @xmath325% .",
    "our estimates show reasonable qualitative agreement with these results .",
    "it is worth noting that our method differs significantly from that of @xcite , who use stellar population modeling of @xmath1 sdss galaxies with no reference to @xmath0 galaxies , and do not use the clustering of either population .",
    "our present analysis uses the population synthesis model only to obtain stellar mass - to - light ratios ( not evolutionary ages ) , and our conclusions about stellar mass growth result from the hod modeling of clustering at the two different redshifts .",
    "the agreement between the results from the two methods is therefore impressive .",
    "our results can also be compared with studies of the evolution of star formation rates ( sfrs ) as a function of stellar mass . analyzing the aegis ( all wavelength extended groth strip international survey ) data out to @xmath0 , @xcite find that star - forming galaxies form a distinct sequence with a power - law dependence of the sfr on the stellar mass ( see also @xcite ) . converted to the `` diet '' salpeter imf",

    "modeling galaxy clustering data in more redshift slices between @xmath0 and @xmath1 would lead to a better understanding of the implication of the general growth rate .",
    "the numbers derived here should be taken as a first - order estimate , as we have performed an approximate calculation as a proof of concept .",
    "there are two limiting factors in the current data .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the samples used here are defined using galaxy luminosity , and modeling stellar mass - selected samples would be more appropriate for measuring the evolution of the stellar mass growth rate as a function of halo mass .",
    "the other complication is the different rest - frame color selections of the galaxies , in particular the effect that the deep2 samples used are not entirely volume limited for red galaxies ( see   [ subsec : deep2 ] ) .",
    "this could lead to an underestimate of the mean stellar mass , as red galaxies have a higher stellar mass than blue galaxies at a given luminosity .",
    "therefore , we may be overestimating the stellar mass evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "with smaller , volume - limited deep2 samples at a slightly lower redshift , we estimate that the fraction of galaxies missing in each deep2 sample is @xmath310% and we also find that the mean stellar mass is likely to be underestimated by 20%30% .",
    "this means that @xmath325% more of the stellar mass could have been in place in the @xmath0 progenitors than the numbers we quote here , which would move the line in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mstarratio ] ( and the lowest line in fig .",
    "[ fig : contribution ] ) up by @xmath325% . consequently , the top solid line in figure  [ fig : contribution ] would shift upward to the place of the dotted line .",
    "the star formation contribution to the stellar mass growth at the lower ( higher ) halo mass end we probe would change from @xmath370% ( @xmath325% ) to @xmath365% ( @xmath35% ) .",
    "however , despite these uncertainties , the general trend of the contribution to the stellar mass growth as a function of host halo mass remains the same . therefore , the halo mass - dependent evolution trend inferred from the data is a robust result .      with the relation between stellar mass and halo mass at two epochs in hand , we now present the evolution of the star formation efficiency and discuss the implications .",
    "assuming that the baryon fraction in halos equals the mean baryonic fraction @xmath259 in the universe , for which we adopt the value 15.7% ( see   [ sec : cosmology ] ) , then stellar mass can be used to study the star formation efficiency as a function of halo mass at @xmath1 and @xmath0 . specifically , we associate a halo of mass @xmath9 with a baryon mass @xmath260 and define @xmath261 as the star - formation efficiency , where @xmath253 is the stellar mass of the _ central _ galaxy in the halo .",
    "this star formation efficiency is , in essence , the value integrated from the redshift of formation to the epoch in consideration ( @xmath0 for deep2 galaxies and @xmath1 for sdss galaxies ) and reflects the fraction of baryons associated with halos that have been converted to stars in the central galaxies by the given epoch . in practice ,",
    "the baryon fraction in a halo may not equal the global fraction , due to various physical processes .",
    "for example , in a low - mass halo there may be a smaller fraction of baryons accreted because of the shallow potential well .",
    "therefore , more accurately , the halo star formation efficiency defined here is the true star formation efficiency times the baryon accretion efficiency of the halo .",
    "nevertheless , it is still an instructive quantity that can be interpreted as an apparent star formation efficiency .",
    "we note that by definition this efficiency does not include stars in satellite galaxies , whose contribution increases with halo mass ( about a few percent at @xmath238 and @xmath340% at @xmath245 , according to the estimates in ",
    "[ sec : stellarmass_evolution ] ) .    figure  [ fig : mstarfrac ] shows this star formation efficiency , reflecting the fraction of baryons that are converted into stars at the two epochs .",
    "both lines are calculated from the ratio of the arithmetic mean stellar mass of central galaxies in halos of a given mass to the average baryon mass associated with these halos .",
    "at @xmath1 , there is a characteristic mass scale of halos , @xmath262 , where the average conversion efficiency from baryons to stars in central galaxies reaches a maximal value . even at this peak ,",
    "only @xmath327% of the baryons in the halo are converted into stars of the central galaxy .",
    "the star formation efficiency drops steeply at lower halo masses and declines more slowly at higher halo masses .    at @xmath0 ,",
    "our inferred average conversion efficiency has a similar behavior to that at @xmath1 , but the overall conversion efficiency decreases and the peak is reached at a larger halo mass ( @xmath3@xmath153 ) with a value of @xmath312% . while the absolute value of the efficiency depends on the imf , the trend as a function of mass and thus the characteristic halo mass should not .    @xcite infer the star formation efficiency at @xmath1 by matching the observed galaxy stellar mass function with the theoretical halo mass function .",
    "their result ( see the dashed line in their fig.5 ) is in a good agreement with ours on the trend of the efficiency with halo mass ; our values are slightly lower than theirs but are well within the error bars .",
    "@xcite perform hod modeling of galaxy - galaxy lensing for stellar mass - selected sdss galaxy samples .",
    "the stellar mass in their study assumes the @xcite imf , which is about 30% lower than the diet salpeter imf we adopt here .",
    "with the imf difference corrected , our estimate of the dependence of the @xmath1 star formation efficiency on halo mass agrees well with their results ( see their table  3 ) . after correcting for differences in the adopted imf and halo definitions , in the relevant halo mass range our results at @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath0 also agree with those reported by @xcite based on a weak gravitational lensing study of the _ hubble space telescope _ gems ( galaxy evolution from morphologies and sed ) survey .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our results follow from the mass distribution of cdm halos and the galaxy assignment required to reproduce the observed clustering , while the galaxy lensing results are from direct measurements of the dark matter halos through their weak - lensing effects .",
    "the agreement between our results and the lensing results is therefore , again , impressive .    what determines the halo mass scale where the average conversion efficiency reaches a maximum ?",
    "it could be star formation feedback or preheating .",
    "@xcite argue that present day halos less massive than @xmath153 were embedded in pancakes of @xmath263 at @xmath264 , whose formation heats and compresses the gas , leading to a cooling time longer than the age of the universe at @xmath265 .",
    "therefore , in halos below @xmath153 , there is not much cold gas available for star formation , which leads to the drop in the conversion efficiency .",
    "our @xmath1 mass scale is roughly consistent with their prediction . on the other hand ,",
    "our results indicate that this halo mass scale shifts to a higher mass at @xmath0 . if true , preheating alone may not be sufficient to explain this mass scale . the intensity of star formation and the subsequent feedback as a function of halo mass and redshift may also be an important factor .",
    "the shift of the peak of star formation efficiency from high - mass halos to low - mass halos with time can be regarded as another manifestation of the downsizing pattern seen in star - forming galaxies . for both deep2 and sdss galaxies ,",
    "the drop of conversion efficiency above the characteristic halo mass could be in part due to the fact that we only consider stars in central galaxies , and in high - mass halos the stellar mass contributions from satellite galaxies can be substantial . in addition , in high - mass halos gas accretion becomes less efficient because of the high virial temperature .",
    "we note again that the stellar mass results presented here are shown mainly as a proof of concept and any conclusions based on these should be regarded as tentative .",
    "we perform hod modeling of the projected galaxy two - point correlation functions @xmath142 for luminosity threshold samples of deep2 and sdss galaxies at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the hod modeling , which converts galaxy pair statistics to relations between galaxy properties and dark matter halos , reproduces well the galaxy correlation functions at these two redshifts , including the rise on small scales seen at @xmath0 .",
    "we infer the relationship between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass at @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that at both redshifts the mean central galaxy luminosity @xmath168 increases with halo mass . in low - mass halos below @xmath266 , @xmath168 increases more rapidly with halo mass , and the scatter in the central galaxy luminosity in halos of fixed mass appears larger , possibly reflecting the broad distribution of major star formation epochs in these halos .",
    "we find evolution in the hod in that galaxies at a given halo mass are @xmath31.4 times more luminous at @xmath0 and for a given luminosity the halo mass is @xmath31.6 times greater at @xmath1 , with the caution that luminosities of deep2 and sdss are in different rest - frame bands .",
    "in addition , central @xmath2 galaxies are found to be in halos a few times more massive at @xmath0 than at @xmath1 .    for both deep2 and sdss galaxies",
    ", there exists a scaling relation between @xmath57 , the characteristic minimum mass of the halo that can host a central galaxy above a given luminosity threshold , and @xmath144 , the mass scale of a halo that on average is able to host one satellite galaxy above the same luminosity threshold .",
    "there is little difference between the scaling relation at @xmath0 ( @xmath267 ) and that at @xmath1 ( @xmath268 ) .",
    "the fraction of galaxies that are satellites decreases with increasing galaxy luminosity at both redshifts . at a fixed luminosity threshold ( in units of @xmath2 )",
    "sdss galaxies have a larger satellite fraction than deep2 galaxies , e.g. , @xmath320% versus @xmath310% for @xmath269 galaxies .    the ultimate goal in modeling galaxy clustering at different redshifts",
    "is to learn about galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "these hod modeling results provide us with relationships between galaxies and dark matter halos at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , spanning half the history of the universe .",
    "we use the typical growth of dark matter halos as determined from simulations to establish an evolutionary link between deep2 and sdss galaxies and extract information about galaxy evolution over the last 7 billion years .",
    "we establish such a connection , on average , by linking @xmath1 central galaxies to @xmath0 central galaxies residing in the progenitor halos of the @xmath1 halos .",
    "we relate the luminosities of @xmath1 central galaxies to those of their @xmath0 progenitors ; however , the interpretation is complicated somewhat by the different rest - frame selection bands of sdss and deep2 galaxies . as a proof of concept , we use stellar masses determined by galaxy color and luminosity to roughly estimate the evolution of the dependence of stellar mass on host halo dark matter mass . at @xmath0",
    "the mean fraction of baryons that have been converted into stars is below @xmath315% , peaking at a halo mass of @xmath153 . at @xmath1",
    "this fraction is below @xmath330% and the peak of the star formation efficiency is at a lower halo mass of @xmath262 .",
    "we find that , on average , the majority of stars in @xmath1 central galaxies in low - mass halos ( a few @xmath270 ) formed between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while only a small fraction of stars formed in central galaxies of halos as massive as @xmath6 .",
    "this reflects the downsizing pattern seen for star - forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass , shown now as a function of their host halo mass .",
    "the stellar mass results presented here are preliminary , as the galaxy samples we model are defined by luminosity , not stellar mass .",
    "in addition , the sdss and deep2 surveys have different rest - frame selection functions , which complicates comparing the results at the two redshifts .",
    "ideally we would like to have stellar mass - selected galaxy samples at different redshifts from surveys that have the same rest - frame selection functions .",
    "while our results apparently agree with other studies in many aspects , we regard our conclusions on the details of the stellar mass evolution as tentative .",
    "nevertheless , the halo mass - dependent evolution trend we infer appears to be robust , and the exercise serves as a starting point and guide for future work .",
    "hod modeling of galaxy clustering for stellar mass - selected samples at different redshifts would be a great tool for gaining insight on galaxy formation and evolution , and we plan to pursue this in future work . unlike the simple estimates presented in this paper , which are based on a mean relationship between the final halo mass and progenitor halo mass , a comprehensive program would be more sophisticated .",
    "halos at high redshift , populated with galaxies as a function of stellar mass in accordance with the hod results , would serve as initial conditions . then , assuming no star formation , these halos would be evolved forward in time to lower redshift , following the merging histories and satellite dynamics determined from simulations or analytic models .",
    "this method is similar to the semi - analytic galaxy formation model in merging of halos and dynamically evolving satellites , but here the initial conditions are set by the hod modeling results .",
    "this method differs from semi - analytic models in that only dark matter evolution and dynamics , not baryon physics , are involved in the calculation .",
    "the difference between the evolved hod and the hod inferred from galaxy clustering at low redshift would then provide a wealth of information on star formation as a function of halo mass .",
    "for example , the contributions to stellar mass in central galaxies can be separated  what fractions are from star formation , from central galaxies in other halos that merge with them , and from minor mergers with satellite galaxies .",
    "we would also infer the average star formation history in satellite galaxies .",
    "if galaxy clustering is modeled at a series of redshifts , then the average _ continuous _ star formation history and the average stellar mass growth history from other modes ( i.e. , major and minor mergers ) as a function of halo mass can be determined .",
    "such empirically - derived results would shed light on the physics of galaxy formation , and comparisons with predictions of galaxy formation models would provide stringent tests for galaxy formation theory .",
    "an example of the effort starting along some of these lines is @xcite , which uses @xmath7-body simulations in combination with hod modeling of clustering to put constraints on merging of luminous galaxies from @xmath271 to @xmath272 .    additionally , the envisioned program may also help test the role of environment on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "one of the main assumptions in the current hod framework is that the galaxy content in halos depends only on the halo mass and is statistically independent of the halo s larger scale environment .",
    "@xcite find in simulations a signature of age - dependent halo clustering ( the so - called halo assembly bias , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the environmental effect on halo clustering is essentially negligible for halos above the nonlinear mass scale and becomes stronger for lower mass halos . with the method outlined above we may be able to test the effect of large - scale environment on galaxy evolution .",
    "it is likely that the environment - dependent halo clustering does not play a significant role in interpreting the observed galaxy clustering at high redshift due to the fast drop of the nonlinear mass ( e.g. , from @xmath232 to @xmath54 , the nonlinear mass increases by a factor of @xmath325 , while halos only grow by a factor of about 2 in a large range of mass ) .",
    "when we passively evolve a high - redshift hod , which is insensitive to the environment , to lower redshift , the environmental effect during the evolution can be fully taken into account .",
    "comparing then the evolved hod ( which accounts for the environmental effect ) with the hod inferred from the low redshift data ( which ignores the environmental effect ) may provide insight on how environment shapes the hod and determines properties of galaxies in low - mass halos , increasing the constraining power of galaxy clustering on galaxy formation processes .",

    "given a measured two - point correlation function for a galaxy population , hod modeling is the ideal path to infer information about the host halos .",
    "however , this involves non - trivial modeling efforts , and therefore approximations are often used in the literature .",
    "one commonly - used method assumes that there is one galaxy per halo and connects galaxies to halos through the large - scale bias factor .",
    "this assumes that all galaxies in the sample are central galaxies , while in reality a small fraction are satellite galaxies . using a simple hod model , we quantify the resulting systematic bias in the inferred halo mass and the duty cycle of galaxies from this assumption .",
    "we consider galaxy samples defined by a lower threshold in luminosity or stellar mass . the usual procedure associated with the `` one galaxy per halo ''",
    "assumption is as follows .",
    "the large - scale bias factor of galaxies is obtained from the ratio of the measured galaxy two - point correlation function and the theoretical matter two - point correlation function under the assumed cosmology .",
    "this large - scale bias factor is the same as that of halos above a mass threshold . since for an assumed cosmology the latter is a known function of mass threshold ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the halo mass threshold @xmath57 can be determined .",
    "the number density of halos above the mass threshold @xmath57 can be inferred from the halo mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the observed galaxy number density to the inferred halo number density is used to determine the duty cycle of galaxies .",
    "more exactly , the `` one galaxy per halo '' assumption should be called `` @xmath273 galaxy per halo , '' where @xmath273 is a positive constant smaller than unity representing the duty cycle .    if satellite galaxies are taken into account , using the same galaxy bias factor measured from the data , a different @xmath57 would be inferred . to see how large the difference is",
    ", we assume a simple mean occupation function to represent the `` truth ; '' this model is the sum of a step function for central galaxies and a power law for satellite galaxies , @xmath274 for @xmath275 . following galaxy formation model predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hod modeling results ( e.g. , this paper ; @xcite ) , we use @xmath276 .",
    "the above @xmath277 can have an overall normalization factor smaller than unity ( duty cycle factor ) , and none of our results below change .",
    "the bias factor @xmath224 for a given galaxy sample ( in which all galaxies reside in halos of mass @xmath275 ) can be calculated as @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the halo mass function and @xmath280 is the bias factor of halos of mass @xmath9 ( following @xcite ) .",
    "solid lines in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : appendix ] show the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath281 at different redshifts .",
    "assuming one galaxy per halo , the bias is calculated by replacing @xmath282 with unity in equation  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) .",
    "dotted lines in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : appendix ] show this relation . at a given bias factor ( measured from the galaxy two - point correlation function ) , the value of @xmath57 with the assumption of no satellite galaxies ( _ dotted lines _ ) is always higher than the `` true '' value ( _ solid lines _ ) because massive halos ( with high halo bias ) are weighted more as the number of satellites increases with halo mass .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : appendix ] shows the ratio of the @xmath57 from the `` one galaxy per halo '' method to the true value at each redshift , as a function of the galaxy bias .",
    "when the bias is high , the corresponding halos are in the exponential tail of the mass function and the weight from the satellite galaxies residing in massive halos is less significant , therefore , the value of @xmath57 inferred from the approximate method approaches its true value .",
    "however , the difference increases for lower galaxy biases , corresponding to the shallower part of the halo mass function , and at higher redshift .",
    "for instance , at @xmath54 , for a galaxy sample with @xmath283 , the estimated @xmath57 can be a factor of 2 higher than the true value .",
    "the difference in the inferred values of @xmath57 leads to a difference in the inferred number densities of halos above @xmath57 .",
    "the halo number density @xmath284 is calculated as @xmath285 the right panels of figure  [ fig : appendix ] compare the inferred ( from `` @xmath273 galaxy per halo '' ) and the true number densities of halos as a function of galaxy bias . for a given galaxy bias , the halo number density derived from the approximate",
    "@xmath57 is always lower than the true value because without satellites in massive halos , a larger value of @xmath57 is needed to reach the given bias factor . as with @xmath57 , the estimated halo number density approaches the true value for highly biased galaxy samples , while for low bias factors , the difference can again be substantial .",
    "for example , at @xmath54 , the number density of host halos for galaxies with @xmath283 is underestimated by a factor of 2 . as a consequence , the duty cycle ( the fraction of halos hosting galaxies of that type )",
    "is overestimated by using the underestimated halo number density .    for galaxy samples defined by a lower threshold ( e.g. in luminosity ) , figure  [ fig : appendix ] can be used to better estimate the minimum host halo mass and number density from the measured galaxy bias value , instead of assuming one galaxy per halo .",

    "<S> we find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass . on average , the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in @xmath1 low - mass halos ( @xmath5 ) is the result of star formation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high mass halos ( @xmath6 ) is the result of star formation over this period . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time . with appropriately defined galaxy samples at different redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> future work can combine hod modeling of the clustering with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a brief discussion of systematic biases related to the assumption of `` one galaxy per halo '' in estimating the mass scale and number density of host halos from the observed clustering strength of galaxies . </S>"
