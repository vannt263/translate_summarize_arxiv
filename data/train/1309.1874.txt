    "materials exhibiting more than one ferroic ordering phenomena in a single phase are defined as multiferroics @xcite . over the last few years",
    ", magneto - electric multiferroics have received a special attention from solid - state and materials researchers for the exciting possibility of controlling magnetization by external electric field and electric polarization by external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that there is a scarcity of materials that simultaneously exhibit ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "in fact , it appeared that a ferroelectric order rarely coexists with any long - range magnetic order @xcite .",
    "this was attributed to the fact that ferroelectric materials typically have a @xmath0 electronic configuration , whereas it is the partial filling of @xmath1-levels that is responsible for magnetism in a large number of compounds . following this observation researchers started to search for materials that are exceptions to this _",
    "rule_. over the course of last decade , the original definition of magneto - electric multiferroic order has been extended to include materials which exhibit ferroelectric order together with any long - range magnetic order @xcite . within this new definition of multiferroics , a large class of new multiferroic compounds have been discovered , which range from transition - metal oxides to organic crystals @xcite . on the theoretical side , many new mechanisms were proposed that allow the ferroelectric order to coexist with a magnetic order @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations for such immense interest in this research field is the possibility of designing powerful memory devices using multiferroic materials , where an electrical writing and a non - destructive magnetic reading is allowed @xcite .",
    "therefore , switching magnetization ( polarization ) by an external electric ( magnetic ) field are the most desirable characteristics for a useful multiferroic material .",
    "the necessary condition for this special feature to be present in multiferroics is the existence of a strong coupling between the ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters .",
    "therefore one guiding principle has been to search for systems where the magnetic and ferroelectric orders are not independent of each other .",
    "strong magneto - electric coupling was discovered in some systems with a spiral type long - range magnetic order , where the ferroelectricity is induced by the spiral spin states @xcite .",
    "typically , such spiral spin states emerge either from competing interactions or from the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions , and therefore these states exist only at low temperatures .",
    "indeed , such spiral magnetic phases have been observed below @xmath2 in some manganites @xcite .",
    "the ferroelectrics where the magnetic order is responsible for the ferroelectricity have come to be known as improper ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "incidentally , there have been very few examples of systems where a magnetic order is induced by a ferroelectric order @xcite .",
    "while the low - temperature multiferroics help us in understanding various mechanisms , they are far from being useful in any realistic applications .",
    "therefore , the second challenge in this field is to find a multiferroic material with high transition temperatures .",
    "although , the most well known multiferroic , bifeo@xmath3 , has large magnetic and ferroelectric ordering temperatures , the coupling between the two order parameters is rather weak @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnetism in bifeo@xmath3 comes from the fe , whereas ferroelectricity arises due to off - centering of the bi ions",
    ". the temperature scales for magnetic and ferroelectric ordering are very different , which is also an indication of the independent origins of the two ordering phenomena in this material .",
    "interestingly , it is an oxide of cu that emerges as a promising candidate with high transition temperatures and strong magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "oxides of cu have a very special place in the history of condensed matter physics thanks to the famous high - temperature superconductors , the cuprates @xcite .",
    "another oxide of cu , cupric oxide ( cuo ) , has been of research interest due to its intriguing magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "synthesis of cuo in tetragonal phase has caused much excitement in the scientific community for its possibly large value of neel temperature @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "recent discovery of a ferroelectric behavior in cuo at @xmath5k has revived research interest in this material from the point of view of multiferroics @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is the high - tc material as far as the multiferroics with large magneto - electric coupling are concerned @xcite .",
    "the only disadvantage appears to be the narrow range of existence of the ferroelectric order , which coincides with a non - collinear magnetic order observed between @xmath6k and @xmath7k .",
    "however , recent theoretical studies have predicted that the range of stability as well as the neel temperature of the non - collinear magnetic order can be tremendously increased by external pressure , leading to a possible room - temperature multiferroic behavior in cuo @xcite .",
    "the discovery of this high - tc multiferroic material posed various questions regarding the microscopic understanding of the phenomena .",
    "a number of theoretical investigations have been reported since the discovery of high - temperature ferroelectricity in cuo @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the magnetic interactions in cuo are rather complicated , and lead to competing ground states .",
    "there is still no consensus on the experimental values of the various exchange parameters @xcite .",
    "similarly , the outcome of the theoretical calculations of the exchange parameters depend on the details of the method used @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most theoretical models point to a near degeneracy of magnetic states in this system .",
    "proposed that the competition between a small uniaxial anisotropy and weak dm interactions leads to the observed experimental behavior of the ferroelectric polarization .",
    "the model was further improved by jin _",
    "et al . _ by explicitly including the lattice parameters in the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "both these models point towards a crucial role played by entropic effects in stabilizing the non - collinear magnetic phase at high temperatures .",
    "the high temperature crystal structure of cuo is centrosymmetric and the inversion symmetry breaking occurs at the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "in fact , the non - collinear magnetic order explicitly breaks the inversion symmetry and the symmetry breaking in the crystal structure can be seen as a secondary effect via the inverse dm mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to ask if the non - collinear magnetic order observed in cuo can be explained via pure spin hamiltonians arising out of electron - electron interactions , without including the effects of lattice distortions .",
    "the ferroelectric distortions can then be understood in terms of the inverse dm effect .    in this work",
    "we explore some features of the magnetic ordering phenomena in cuo without taking into account the detailed crystal structure of the material . in order to keep the scope of this work general we use a simple two dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice with nearest and next - nearest neighbor magnetic exchange couplings .",
    "the model does not include an explicit symmetry breaking term such as a dm interaction , however it includes higher order spin - spin interaction terms .",
    "such terms arise in the fourth order in strong coupling expansion of the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "although the strength of the higher order terms is much weaker than the heisenberg exchange terms , the former become important due to near degeneracy of states in the pure heisenberg model .",
    "we present extensive monte carlo simulation results on a 2d bilinear - biquadratic heisenberg model .",
    "we find that the biquadratic coupling drives a first order phase transition between a collinear up - up - down - down type antiferromagnet ( denoted as eaf ) and a spiral antiferromagnet at low temperatures . at finite temperatures",
    "the non - collinear phase is found to be more stable compared to the collinear phase .",
    "this leads to a sequence of phase transitions from a high - temperature paramagnetic state to a non - collinear state , and finally to a collinear eaf phase at low temperatures .",
    "this is precisely the behavior reported in the experimental studies of cuo .",
    "we find that a pure electronic hamiltonian is sufficient to describe the magnetism in cuo provided higher - order interaction terms are taken into account . while our model study is of general importance for magnetic materials and models , the conclusions are of particular relevance to the magnetic and ferroelectric ordering phenomena in cuo .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe possible extensions of the standard heisenberg model for spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath9 magnetic moments .",
    "we discuss the relevance of these models and their relation with each other in the classical limit .",
    "section ii ends with a description of the variational , and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation methods used in this work .",
    "section iii begins with a discussion of the ground state phase diagrams of the two models using variational calculations .",
    "next , a comparison between variational calculations and mc simulations at low temperatures is presented .",
    "finally , the finite - temperature behavior of the bilinear - biquadratic model is discussed .",
    "the main focus is on the presence of a non - collinear magnetic phase with finite spin current at high temperatures .",
    "conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "we begin with a heisenberg hamiltonian on a square lattice given by ,    @xmath10    here , @xmath11 denotes the nearest neighbor ( nn ) heisenberg exchange coupling and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) couplings as shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the single and double angular brackets denote the sum over nn and nnn sites , respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the summation indices specify the two inequivalent nnn directions . for most spin systems with square lattice geometry ,",
    "one is typically interested in the parameter regime given by , @xmath16 .",
    "however , another interesting limit of this model is realized when @xmath12 and @xmath13 have opposite signs and are much larger in magnitude compared to @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding model for ising spins was recently analyzed by a. kalz and g. chitov , and the existence of an unusual topological floating phase was reported @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that in this limit , the magnetic system gets divided into two sub - lattices which interpenetrate each other . @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 ensure that each sub - lattice has a well defined order at low temperatures , but the nn heisenberg coupling @xmath11 is not sufficient to generate a long - range magnetic order .",
    "therefore , in this parameter regime higher order spin - spin interaction terms become relevant .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic model for cuo corresponds to a similar sub - lattice order in three dimensions ( 3d ) where each sub - lattice has a well defined order but the magnetic ground state is degenerate and additional weaker couplings , such as the magneto - crystalline anisotropy and the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , are considered important .",
    "however , the higher order spin - spin interactions should be given equal importance in this regime .",
    "proceeding with this viewpoint , our first extension of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath18 is achieved by including a four - spin ring - exchange interaction , leading to the hamiltonian ,    @xmath19 } \\left [ ( { \\bf s}_i\\cdot{\\bf s}_j ) ( { \\bf s}_m\\cdot{\\bf s}_n ) + \\right .",

[ fig1](b ) ) . starting with a one - band hubbard model at half - filling , the 2nd order perturbation theory in hopping leads to the heisenberg exchange @xcite .",
    "if we go beyond the second order , the next contribution is from the fourth order term leading to the ring - exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 is the microscopic hamiltonian for spin-@xmath8 moments on a square lattice .",
    "if the magnetic moments are spin-@xmath9 , then the next order term is a biquadratic one involving two sites @xcite .",
    "we define our 2nd hamiltonian , @xmath22 , by including a biquadratic term to @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by ,    @xmath23    here , @xmath24 is the coupling strength of the biquadratic interaction , which we have taken to be present only on the nn bond along the x - direction ( see fig . [ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "@xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the spin hamiltonian containing interaction terms up to 4th order for spin-@xmath8 ( spin-@xmath9 ) magnetic moments .",

    "the boundaries between the spiral phase and the eaf phase are first - order in nature since the order parameter of one phase is not continuously connected to that of the other .",
    "the two most relevant phases are the eaf and the orthogonal ( spiral with @xmath51 ) phase .",

    "the variational results highlight the rich behavior of the models @xmath21 and @xmath22 in terms of the presence of a variety of phases and phase boundaries .",
    "the results further suggest that while the form of higher - order spin - spin interactions arising from a strong - coupling expansion is different for spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath9 magnetic moments , their classical versions lead to phase diagrams with strong similarities .",

    "we then begin with an afm state at @xmath82 and trace back to @xmath81 .",

    "[ fig7 ] . since the order parameter for a spiral state does not evolve continuously to that of an eaf state a hysteresis is present in the computed physical quantities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( a ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "indeed , according to the variational phase diagram the regime of eaf state is between @xmath85 , which is well captured by the monte carlo results .",
    "the eaf phase is absent in the phase diagram for @xmath86 , and therefore the spiral state connects a fm ( spiral with wave - vector @xmath87 ) continuously to an afm ( spiral with wave - vector @xmath88 ) , hence no hysteresis behavior is found in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( b ) and ( d ) . in order to make these comparisons quantitative , we plot @xmath84 obtained from variational calculations ( blue circles in fig .",

    "monte - carlo simulations performed directly at low temperature accurately capture the variational results .",
    "the above checks confirm the validity of ground state phase diagrams obtained via the variational method .",
    "they also serve as a benchmark for the efficiency of our monte - carlo simulations .",
    "in addition to the above checks , we also compared the energies obtained from the mc at low temperatures ( @xmath89 ) with those obtained in the variational calculations , for different choices of parameters belonging to different ground state magnetic phases .",
    "these energy comparisons are shown in table i.    .comparison of energy per spin obtained in variational calculations and that obtained in monte carlo simulations at low temperature ( @xmath89 ) , for different choices of parameter sets .",

    "we also verify using the spin - structure factor @xmath63 that the ordered phases obtained in the mc are same as those shown in the variational phase diagrams for each choice of the parameter sets listed in table i.    having established a correspondence between the variational results and the mc simulations for the ground state phase diagrams of @xmath22 , we now proceed to describe the finite temperature properties of the model using extensive monte carlo simulations . in order to retain the focus",
    ", we again refer to the similarities of the present model with those proposed for cuo . therefore , for the remainder of the paper we focus on a parameter regime which highlights this similarity .      if the hierarchy of the coupling strengths is such that @xmath90 , then it is easy to see that the square lattice separates into two sub - lattices which are interpenetrating each other , but are weakly coupled .",
    "in fact , for @xmath91 these sub - lattices are completely decoupled .",
    "while this situation appears only a theoretical possibility in the present model , as the nnn couplings are stronger than the nn couplings , it can be realized in 3d oxide structures where the strength and the sign of a superexchange interaction crucially depends on the locations of the bridging oxygens in the crystal structure .",
    "cuo presents one example , where not only cu - o - cu superexchange is important but also the cu - o - o - cu super - superexchange contribution is significant @xcite .",
    "such a decoupling into two sub - lattices has been highlighted in tetragonal cuo , where the intra - sublattice exchange parameters are almost six times larger than the inter - sublattice couplings @xcite .",
    "we begin by analyzing the effects of biquadratic coupling on the ground state in a simple variational picture .",
    "lets assume that the vector order parameters of the decoupled sub - lattices make an angle @xmath92 with each other .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig [ fig8 ] where solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) lines highlight the two sub - lattices .",
    "within each sub - lattice the spins are arranged ferromagnetically along one diagonal and antiferromagnetically along the other .",
    "the relative orientation of the spins on two sub - lattices is parameterized by angle @xmath92 .",
    "the ground state energy of the system in the absence of bi - quadratic couplings is independent of @xmath92 , and hence there is a degeneracy of magnetic states in the system .",
    "the additional energy contribution due to the biquadratic coupling @xmath24 can be written as @xmath93 . minimizing the energy by demanding @xmath94 and @xmath95 , leads to two possible solutions : @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the introduction of a biquadratic coupling term lifts the degeneracy and stabilizes two specific phases , the eaf state or the orthogonal spiral state , depending on the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "these two phases are analogous to the af@xmath52 and af@xmath53 magnetic states of cuo .",
    "one of the interesting features in cuo is the existence of a non - collinear af@xmath53 magnetic state at high temperatures .",
    "this magnetic state supports a finite spin current due to its spiral nature and therefore is responsible for the high - temperature ferroelectric behavior of cuo .",
    "this is unusual as in most frustrated magnets , it is the low - temperature phase that supports a non - collinear magnetic phase and hence the ferroelectricity is observed only at low temperatures . given the similarity of the present model with that of cuo , it is natural to ask if a spiral magnetic order exists at high temperatures within the present model .    in order to answer this",
    ", we compute the spin current as a measure of the spiral nature of non - collinear magnetism .",
    "note that a canted phase is also non - collinear but this will not lead to a finite spin current . following katsura _",
    "_ we define spin current as @xcite    @xmath100    where the vertical bars denote the magnitude of the vector and the angular brackets denote thermal average .",
    "@xmath101 can be regarded as a local measure of spin current on a given bond along x - direction originating at lattice site @xmath102 .",
    "temperature dependence of the spin current @xmath103 is shown in fig . [ fig9](a ) for negative values of @xmath24 .",
    "the monte carlo results are consistent with the variational analysis and @xmath103 indeed vanishes at low temperatures .",
    "the high temperature behavior is intriguing : there is a window in temperature where @xmath103 becomes finite , indicating the existence of a non - collinear magnetic state at finite temperatures .",
    "interestingly , the temperature range of stability of the non - collinear magnetic state increases upon decreasing the magnitude of @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that the non - collinear phase may be entropy driven , as a large negative @xmath24 favors the collinear state and hence competes with the non - collinear state at high temperatures , narrowing the window of stability of the later state .",
    "we also notice that the spin current shows large fluctuations , which is the origin of relatively large error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a),(c ) .    recalling the definition eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we note that @xmath104 at @xmath105 ( denoted as @xmath106 ) is an order parameter for the eaf phase .",
    "@xmath107 represents the local degree of collinearity between neighboring spins along @xmath68-direction .",
    "note that in the eaf phase , the dot - product between neighboring spins have a perfect staggered order .",
    "this motivates the use of @xmath106 as an order parameter for the eaf phase , much like the staggered magnetization is an order parameter for the afm state .",
    "the temperature - dependence of @xmath106 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( b ) for @xmath99 .",
    "the ground state is collinear as the order parameter rises smoothly to its maximal value upon reducing temperature in our simulations .",
    "the temperature at which @xmath106 shows an abrupt rise , correlates well with the temperature at which the spin current begins to fall .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of @xmath103 and @xmath106 can be used to assign characteristic temperatures at which the collinear and the spiral magnetic orders set in .",
    "next , we study the behavior of the model for positive values of @xmath24 . in agreement with the variational results ,",
    "the ground state supports a non - collinear order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "@xmath108 indeed corresponds to the orthogonal magnetic phase where neighboring spins point at an angle of 90@xmath109 to each other .",
    "therefore the transition between a collinear and non - collinear magnetic orders as a function of @xmath24 is well captured in our simulations .",
    "however , the finite - temperature behavior of the model is quite different for positive @xmath24 .",
    "the spin current shows a non - monotonic dependence on temperature , which is similar for different values of @xmath24 . upon",
    "increasing temperature @xmath103 decreases smoothly from its maximum value and then shows a weak rise before decreasing again .",
    "the collinear order parameter does not show any considerable rise in the intermediate temperature range . for @xmath110 , we find that @xmath111 in the high - temperature pm state . the maximum value of @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ fig9](d ) is only about two times larger .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the behavior of spiral order parameter @xmath103 , which in the negative @xmath24 regime shows a value about 30 times larger than that in pm state ( see fig . [",
    "fig9](a ) ) .",
    "clearly , the collinear state is only energetically stable and exists at finite temperatures only when @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that the non - collinear phase at high temperatures is stabilized by entropic effects .",
    "this is in agreement with previous material - specific models for cuo @xcite .",
    "however , our results show that these results are a general feature of a model where the standard heisenberg term leads to a degeneracy of magnetic states , and the ground state selection relies on weaker higher - order couplings . one clear advantage of the bilinear - biquadratic model is that the competition is only between eaf and orthogonal spiral states .",
    "this is unlike the models invoking dm coupling and magnetocrystalline anisotropy where it is possible to stabilize a spiral phase with arbitrary @xmath64 depending on the relative strengths of the dm coupling and anisotropy @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the real - space approach is that we can investigate the spatial character of the finite - temperature non - collinear magnetism . for this purpose , we plot the real - space snap - shots of the local collinear and non - collinear order parameters , @xmath107 and @xmath113 . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the ground state is the up - up - down - down type antiferromaget which corresponds to @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( denoted as eaf ) . the real space pattern at finite temperature ( @xmath115 ) show regions with strong non - collinear spin order ( see fig . [ fig10](a ) ) . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the ground state supports a perfect orthogonal spiral order , where neighboring spins make an angle of @xmath116 with each other . at finite temperatures , regions with weak spiral order",
    "are present as inferred from the real - space distribution of @xmath113 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) ) .",
    "[ fig10](c),(d ) show the corresponding snap - shots of the collinear order , @xmath107 .",
    "collinear order is absent at finite temperatures .",
    "while we only show @xmath113 and @xmath107 for a single configurations here , we have verified that these are typical configurations for @xmath115 .",
    "these real - space patterns also highlight the asymmetry w.r.t . @xmath24 that we discussed earlier .",
    "while at low temperatures the sign of @xmath24 decides the nature of the ordered magnetic state , at finite temperatures it is the non - collinear state that dominates irrespective of the sign of @xmath24 . at finite temperatures",
    "there are many different configurations of spins that are involved in the final thermal average .",
    "the spin current shows strong fluctuations at intermediate temperatures as we noticed in fig . [",
    "fig9](a),(c ) .",
    "however , the energy as a function of temperature ( not shown ) behaves smoothly with error bars less than the typical symbol size in our figures .",
    "strong fluctuations in spin current with weak fluctuations in total energy indicate an unusual energy landscape in configuration space where many different configurations are present within a narrow energy range , and the system easily accesses these configurations .",
    "this explains why the spiral order wins over collinear order at finite temperatures : the availability of many different magnetic configurations with finite spin current increases the entropy of the system .",
    "therefore , the system prefers to visit such configurations more often leading to a finite spin current .",
    "this highlights a key role of entropy in stabilizing the non - collinear magnetic order at finite temperatures .",
    "moreover , our results suggest that the finite temperature spiral phase is inhomogeneous . this compares favorably with recent experimental investigations , where the presence of an inhomogeneous ferroelectric phase in cuo has been reported @xcite .",
    "we summarize the results discussed in this section in a finite - temperature phase diagram .",
    "clearly , in the thermodynamic limit there is no long - range order at non - zero temperatures in two - dimensions for a classical continuous - spin model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , numerical simulations on finite lattices can be used to identify characteristic temperatures at which the correlation length for a particular magnetic order exceeds the system size . if the model is extended to three dimensions by allowing a weak interplanar coupling between the 2d layers , the characteristic temperature scales discussed here will be relevant to the genuine phase - transition temperatures .",
    "we use the temperature - dependence of @xmath106 and @xmath103 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) to identify such characteristic temperature scales for collinear eaf and spiral orderings , respectively .",
    "these are brought together as a phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "the ordering between the pm and the inhomogeneous spiral phase is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "this corresponds to the onset of ordering of the two sub - lattices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , which is decided by the strengths of the couplings @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the inhomogeneous spiral phase corresponds to a state where pm regions coexist together with regions supporting large values of spin current . upon reducing temperature further , the system orders into a collinear or non - collinear state depending on the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "the similarity of our results with those obtained on material - specific models for cuo is apparent @xcite .",
    "the experimental situation of cuo is captured well in our model if we assume a small negative value of the biquadratic coupling @xmath24 , where a window of stability of the non - collinear state exists between the collinear eaf and the fully disordered pm state .",
    "our results suggest that this intermediate spiral phase contains inhomogeneities with patches of spiral patterns coexisting with magnetically disordered regions .",
    "we use a combination of variational calculations and monte carlo simulations to study a classical spin model on a 2d square lattice with nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor heisenberg exchange interactions and nearest neighbor biquadratic interactions .",
    "motivated by the existence of a non - collinear magnetic state at high temperatures in cuo @xcite , we study this model in a specific parameter regime where the nnn couplings are inequivalent and are much larger than the nn exchange interactions . in this limit",
    ", the system is decoupled into two sub - lattices and lead to a situation where even a weak biquadratic coupling is vital in selecting the ground state magnetic order .",
    "we also compare the ground states of the bilinear - biquadratic model with those of a model containing a four - spin ring exchange coupling .",
    "it is the ring - exchange coupling that is physically relevant for a spin-@xmath8 system such as cuo .",
    "however , we demonstrate that the classical versions of the quantum models for spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath9 have strong similarities in the parameter regime considered here .",
    "the finite - temperature study of the bilinear - biquadratic model using monte carlo uncovers an inhomogeneous non - collinear magnetic state .",
    "the @xmath117 phase diagram of the model captures the main features of the phase diagrams reported in material - specific models for cuo , which considered the role of dm coupling and weak anisotropy .",
    "the present work helps in understanding the finite - temperature magnetism in cuo within a pure spin model in a general setting without taking into account the details of the crystal structure .",
    "we have shown that if the stronger interactions are such that they compete and lead to a degeneracy of magnetic ground states , then the role of the much weaker higher - order interactions can not be ignored .",
    "these interactions are as important as other weak effects like the magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the spin - orbit induced dm interactions . using the real - space analysis",
    "we also find that the high - temperature spiral phase is inhomogeneous with islands of spiral phase coexisting with paramagnetic regions .",
    "the common feature with the previous model studies is that the entropic effects are crucial in stabilizing the non - collinear state at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "while there have already been some experimental reports that point to an inhomogeneous ferroelectric state in cuo @xcite , it would be very interesting to probe further the spatial nature of the high - temperature non - collinear phase in cuo .",
