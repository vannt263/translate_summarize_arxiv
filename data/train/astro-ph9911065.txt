    "galaxy scaling relations provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution of stellar populations through intermediate redshifts ( @xcite , 1997 ) . since their discovery ( @xcite ) , such scaling laws have been used primarily to measure distances , with a reliability seemingly limited only by measurement errors and the homogeneity of the galaxies in question .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and wfpc2 have enabled high @xmath17 imaging of intermediate redshift galaxies with a resolution similar to ground - based imaging of galaxies in the coma cluster . using the high spatial resolution and @xmath17 of wfpc2 , and efficient spectrographs at large aperture telescopes like the keck 10 m",
    ", we can directly measure galaxy scaling relations up to redshifts of unity in an effort to understand their origins , and how galaxies evolve ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite )",
    ".    of the known scaling relations , the fundamental plane ( @xcite ) has the lowest observed intrinsic scatter , only 15% in distance for a given galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is an empirical correlation between effective radius , @xmath2 , central velocity dispersion , @xmath18 , and surface brightness , @xmath19 , for early - type galaxies . in a study of 11 nearby clusters",
    "jrgensen  ( 1996 ) found , in gunn @xmath20 , @xmath21 with a low ( _ rms _ ) scatter of @xmath22 dex in @xmath2 . in coma ,",
    "the scatter is even lower , @xmath23 in distance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental plane of virgo ellipticals also has a very low internal scatter of @xmath24 in distance ( @xcite ) . using the virial theorem and assuming that early - type galaxies are an homologous family",
    ", the low scatter in the fundamental plane implies a scatter of only @xmath22 in @xmath25 ratio for a given a galaxy mass .",
    "the utility of the fundamental plane for probing the luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies has been clearly demonstrated by van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) , kelson  ( 1997 ) , and van dokkum ( 1998b ) , who measured the evolution of the fundamental plane zero - point out to @xmath26 .",
    "the implied evolution of the @xmath27 ratios is consistent with a high redshift of formation for stars in early - type galaxies in rich clusters .",
    "projections of the fundamental plane , such as the @xmath28 relation ( @xcite ) and the 1-parameter @xmath29 faber - jackson relation ( @xcite ) , have also been used by other authors to study early - type galaxy evolution to high redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "other studies of high redshift cluster galaxies have confirmed the notion that early - type galaxies are homogeneous , and likely to be old ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , dressler  ( 1997 ) showed that there has been substantial evolution in the numbers of s0 galaxies between redshifts @xmath30 and the present .",
    "however , many such results derive from limited imaging of cluster cores .",
    "recently , van dokkum  ( 1998a ) used the color - magnitude relation of early - type galaxies to show that the uniformity of age extends to large radii for the ellipticals of cl1358 + 62 , and that the most recent star - formation in massive clusters has occurred in the outer parts , in galaxies with disks .",
    "van dokkum  showed that the stellar populations of galaxies with disks are less homogeneous than pure bulge systems , but only at cluster radii which are outside the standard wfpc2 footprint ( at the distances of intermediate redshift clusters ) .",
    "evolution in cluster galaxies may be best detected in large , wide - field surveys of clusters : cluster membership , wide spatial extent , and large samples inclusive of all morphological types are all crucial for finding , and measuring the evolution in cluster populations . surveys which are specifically biased towards ellipticals may miss much of the recent ( @xmath31 ) evolution in cluster galaxies because the samples are biased against those morphologies which have undergone the most recent epochs of star - formation .    the first detailed study of membership in cl1358 + 62 was performed by fabricant  ( 1991 ) , who measured a blue and active galaxy fraction of 15% .",
    "complete membership to @xmath32 mag is discussed by fisher  ( 1998 ) and a small subsample was used by kelson  ( 1997 ) to find the fundamental plane zero - point for the cluster .",
    "van dokkum  ( 1998a ) has made a complete analysis of the color - magnitude relation of 194 confirmed cluster members within the @xmath33 hst mosaic .",
    "the imaging consists of two colors ( f606w and f814w ) in 12 cvz pointings .",
    "this wfpc2 imaging of cl1358 + 62 is a superb foundation for building a detailed history of cluster galaxies , from the current epoch , through intermediate redshifts .",
    "future work will concentrate on mosaics of wfpc2 imaging in the clusters ms205304 ( @xmath34 ) and ms105403 ( @xmath26 ) .    since the publication of kelson  ( 1997 )",
    ", we have completed the surface photometry for a high - resolution spectroscopic sample of galaxies within the hst mosaic s field .",
    "this subset of the large membership database will be used for analysis of the fundamental plane and absorption line strength properties .",
    "the data are discussed in  [ data ] .",
    "the photometric calibration , the transformation to redshifted johnson colors , and sources of systematic calibration errors , are discussed ",
    "[ calib ] .",
    "the techniques used to fit @xmath1-law profiles to the data are discussed at length in  [ deriv ] . in  [ psferr ]",
    "we discuss such instrumental issues as the under - sampling and point - spread function errors .",
    "deviations from the de vaucouleurs profile are explored at some length in sections [ genprof ] and [ scomp ] using @xmath5-laws ( @xcite ) and bulge - disk decomposition of the circularized profiles .",
    "tables of the structural parameters are given in  [ adopt ] and",
    "our results are summarized in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the hst imaging consists of 12 contiguous pointings , making up a large mosaic of the cluster environment , about @xmath35 mpc on a side ( where @xmath36 -1 ) .",
    "each pointing consists of three 1200 s exposures in each of f606w and f814w .",
    "the data were preprocessed by the standard pipeline procedures which are discussed elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper was performed on the images processed by van dokkum  ( 1998a ) , who cleaned the images of cosmic rays , modeled and removed the complicated background , and combined the individual exposures .",
    "the most demanding task was the removal of the scattered earth light that resulted from the observations being performed in the continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in some of these observations , the background was higher by factors of two to three .",
    "this scattered light increases the counts in the sky background , and the secondary mirror supports cast shadows in the pattern of an `` x , '' in which the background counts are typically not elevated .",
    "the excess in the background , and contrast between the shadowed and illuminated regions of the ccds can vary greatly , and its magnitude depends on the position of the telescope in its orbit when a cvz exposure is taken .",
    "fortunately , in each set of three exposures , in a given pointing and filter , at least one frame had minimal or no scattered light , thereby allowing accurate modeling of the scattered earth light .",
    "large - order ( @xmath37 ) bivariate polynomials were fit to the background and subtracted .",
    "more details of this modeling are given by van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "the selection of our fundamental plane sample is discussed in kelson  ( 1999a ) .",
    "briefly , we randomly selected cluster members within the field of view of the hst mosaic , to @xmath38 mag .",
    "the selection was performed to efficiently construct multi - slit plates for the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used three masks , with different position angles on the sky .",
    "the region of maximum overlap is in the center of the cluster , and thus the fp sample is concentrated towards the core of the cluster .",
    "morphology was not a factor in the selection of our sample . in the random selection process ,",
    "three e+a galaxies were included ; these will be compared with those cluster members that have normal , early - type spectra .",
    "the sample is about @xmath39 complete for @xmath40 mag ( see @xcite for details on the statistical completeness of the original redshift catalog ) .",
    "three galaxies fainter than @xmath32 mag were added to test the quality of velocity dispersion measurements for faint galaxies .",
    "these spectroscopic observations and their reductions are detailed in kelson  ( 1999a ) . in total",
    ", we have central velocity dispersions for 55 galaxies in the cluster .",
    "unfortunately , two of the galaxies were imaged too close to the wfpc2 ccd edges to obtain reliable structural parameters .",
    "thus , there are a total of 53 cluster members in our determination of the fundamental plane in cl1358 + 62",
    ".    images of these 53 galaxies are shown in figure [ images ] .",
    "the images clearly show a wide range of morphologies , from ellipticals to early - type spirals .",
    "optical morphologies have been taken from fabricant  ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors classified several hundred galaxies in the hst mosaic according to morphological type , @xmath41 . the galaxies in our high - resolution spectroscopic sample",
    "have @xmath42 ( e , e / s0 , s0 , s0/a , sa , sab , sb , respectively ) . the galaxy morphologies are listed in table [ params ] , in which there are 11 e , 6 e / s0 , 14 s0 , 13 s0/a , 6 sa , 2 sab galaxies and 1 sb galaxy .",
    "this distribution is quite similar to nearby massive clusters ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to produce surface photometry for use in the analysis of the fundamental plane in the cluster . to enable comparison of the cl1358 + 62 fundamental plane with equivalent observations of nearby galaxies ,",
    "the calibrated hst photometry must be transformed to a standard system .",
    "such transformations to a photometric system of redshifted johnson @xmath43 and @xmath44 bandpasses will allow us to compare our observations directly to observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "precisely these transformations and calibration steps have been used previously by kelson  ( 1997 ) and van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "each step has its own uncertainties , which will be summarized at the end of the section .      in this section ,",
    "we describe the multiple components in the zero - point calibration of the hst photometry in f606w and f814w .",
    "the starting points of the calibration are the zero - points for f606w and f814w derived by holtzman  ( 1995 ) using photometry of stars ( point sources ) with an aperture of @xmath45 .",
    "our measured surface brightnesses have an effective aperture defined by the extent of our adopted point - spread functions , in this case @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we must correct our magnitudes from the @xmath46 aperture to an effective aperture of @xmath45 . using the encircled energy curves in the _ hst data handbook _",
    ", we estimate the correction to be @xmath47 mag .",
    "the holtzman  ( 1995 ) calibration is also valid for data taken using a gain of @xmath48/adu .",
    "therefore we also incorporate the gain ratios for the individual ccds as given by the handbook .",
    "furthermore , the hst distance scale key project has measured a difference of @xmath49 mag between long and short exposures of identical fields ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) such that long integrations have more counts than would be expected by simply scaling the shorter exposures .",
    "thus , the wfpc2 zero - points , which were derived from short integrations of star fields , are not appropriate for long integrations , and need to be corrected by @xmath50 mag .    in summary ,",
    "the f606w and f814w magnitudes are defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents the ratios of the high- to low - gain modes for the four wfpc2 ccds , respectively : @xmath53 .",
    "the total exposure time for each point was 3600 s per filter .      in order to compare the surface brightnesses and @xmath25 ratios of distant galaxies to equivalent observations made nearby",
    ", we must transform the photometry to a consistent system . towards this end , we define @xmath55 and @xmath56 as the johnson @xmath43 and @xmath44 filter bandpasses redshifted to @xmath0 , the observed frame of the galaxies . as one can see in figure [ filter ] , the @xmath55 and @xmath56 bands fall at roughly 5500   and 7000  , overlapping substantially with the observed f606w and f814w bandpasses . without the color information , one would be required to extrapolate to , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath44 magnitude using @xmath57 corrections",
    ". however , we can derive an accurate transformation from the wfpc2 system to the redshifted johnson system by interpolation using the color information .",
    "as in van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) , the flux in the redshifted filter can be written as a function of the fluxes in the observed bandpasses : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a color term in this transformation ( see below ) . in order to relate the flux in a given bandpass to a standard magnitude , one must use filter constants ( see below ) . solving for @xmath56 as a function of the observed magnitudes and the filter constants , @xmath60 , finds :",
    "@xmath61 + 2.5\\log(1+z)&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the additional factor of @xmath62 compensates for the stretching in wavelength of the redshifted bandpass .",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath56 magnitudes are redshifted measures of the fluxes , not restframe quantities .",
    "removal of the @xmath63 surface brightness dimming is required to convert these data to magnitudes in the restframe of the galaxies .",
    "the filter constants , @xmath60 , are used to convert the @xmath56 , f814w , and f555w magnitudes to a system of flux units in a given filter .",
    "this system can be thought of as similar to an ab system .",
    "these constants are defined by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the magnitude , through filter @xmath65 , in the standard system .",
    "one can calculate the @xmath66 magnitudes of vega in the different filters , and , using the reported magnitudes in the literature for vega ( @xcite ) , define the transformation from the standard ( johnson ) system to an @xmath66 system , based on absolute flux units .",
    "we used the vega spectrum from bohlin ( 1996 , @xcite ) , the filter transmission curves for the wfpc2 filters , and the johnson filter curves ( @xcite ) , as well as the wfpc2 ccd response curve to determine the @xmath66 magnitudes of vega in the various filters .",
    "these @xmath66 magnitudes are zero - pointed to vega , not the spectra of f dwarfs ( _ i.e. _ ab79 , @xcite ; see @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "using the seds of e / s0 galaxies ( @xcite ) , one integrates over the observed and redshifted filter curves to solve for @xmath59 , for a given sed : @xmath67 to find @xmath68 for galaxies with e / s0 spectra at @xmath0 . using seds typical of spirals yield transformations which differ by only @xmath69 mag .",
    "as noted above , these transformations are identical to those used by kelson  ( 1997 ) and van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "colors in the wfpc2 filters are taken directly from van dokkum ( 1998a ) .",
    "they measured @xmath70 colors within @xmath2 for each of the cluster members within the hst mosaic ; their color errors ( random ) are on the order of @xmath69 mag . for the purposes of the photometric calibration , the absolute color uncertainties should approximately equal the quadrature sum of the two holtzman  ( 1995 ) zero - point errors .",
    "other effects , such as the exposure time correction , the charge - transfer effect , gain variations and aperture corrections , cancel since they are equal contributors to the calibration of each bandpass .",
    "we comment more on color uncertainties below .",
    "galactic extinction has been taken from burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) and used in conjunction with cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) to derive the extinctions in the hst filters .",
    "the burstein & heiles @xmath71 color excess is @xmath72 mag . using cardelli , we find @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus , we correct both the measured colors and the redshifted @xmath44 surface brightnesses by @xmath77 mag . because the galactic reddening is low in the direction of cl1358 + 62 , reddening uncertainties will contribute little to the following error budget .",
    "errors in the final calibration of the redshifted @xmath56-band surface brightnesses can arise from three sources : ( 1 ) errors in the hst zero - point calibration , ( 2 ) errors in the measured colors , and ( 3 ) errors in the transformation from the observed to redshifted bandpasses .",
    "we now attempt to summarize these uncertainties , and estimate the total error in our calibrated @xmath56 magnitudes .",
    "each step in the calibration of hst photometry introduces uncertainties . in the previous section",
    ", we showed that the @xmath56-bandpass is very closely tied to f814w , with a moderate color term .",
    "thus , errors in the holtzman  ( 1995 ) zero - point for f814w propagates directly to systematic errors in the @xmath56 magnitudes",
    ". the f814w zero - point uncertainty is listed by holtzman  ( 1995 ) as @xmath78 mag .",
    "their calibration , however , is explicitly valid for the spectral energy distributions of stars , so the calibration has larger uncertainties when applied to the seds of galaxies , probably on the order of 1 - 2% .",
    "furthermore , the holtzman  ( 1995 ) zero - point is valid for @xmath79 radius aperture magnitudes .",
    "our surface brightnesses will have been measured using data deconvolved with a point - spread function with a finite radius ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "therefore , we must correct our data from an effective aperture of @xmath46 to an effective aperture of @xmath45 .",
    "a reasonable estimate for the uncertainty in this correction is @xmath69 mag .",
    "another source of error arises from uncertainties in the extragalactic distance scale key project s correction to the zero - point ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) ; we estimate that it introduces an uncertainty on the order of @xmath81 mag ( half the effect ) .",
    "the color term in the transformation to redshifted @xmath56 is small , with the result that errors in @xmath56 due to uncertainties in the @xmath82 colors are diminished by nearly a factor of five .",
    "these color errors include the uncertainty in the f606w zero - point , which we assume to be on the order of @xmath83 mag , compared to the estimate by holtzman  ( 1995 ) of @xmath84 mag ( the f606w zero - point was determined theoretically , and no additional calibration since holtzman  ( 1995 ) has been attempted ) .",
    "with regard to the colors , any systematic variations in the ccd gain and charge transfer , for example , cancel .",
    "as stated earlier , the error in the adopted galactic reddening is likely to be small , no greater than @xmath69 mag .",
    "thus , the primary component of systematic error is the f606w zero - point .",
    "if the @xmath85 color error can be thought of as the quadrature sum of the holtzman  ( 1995 ) zero - point errors , then the resulting error in @xmath56 from galaxy colors is still @xmath86 mag .",
    "color gradients within the galaxies themselves could be a larger factor , but van dokkum  ( 1998a ) showed that , in the mean , the colors change very little as one adopts different standard radii for measurement of the colors .",
    "errors in the coefficients in the transformation come from several sources .",
    "uncertainties in the filter constants are estimated to be @xmath87 mag in the final transformation .",
    "variations in the intrinsic galaxy seds lead to ( slightly ) different values for the color and constant terms in the transformations themselves , introducing an uncertainty of @xmath69 mag .",
    "lastly , adoption of the hayes ( 1985 ) spectrum of vega may also lead to errors if the wfpc2 photometric calibration sources were not strictly on the same spectrophotometric system as the hayes spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , the magnitude of this uncertainty is not well known , though we estimate it to be no larger than @xmath88 mag based on the agreement of several sources of filter constants with with holtzman  ( 1995 ) .    by adding these contributions in quadrature",
    ", we estimate a total error of @xmath89 mag in @xmath56 and @xmath88 mag in @xmath90 color . for the analysis of the fundamental plane ,",
    "these uncertainties can be treated as systematic errors .",
    "the photometric parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath19 , were obtained by fitting @xmath1-law profiles to the galaxies and two distinct approaches were used to fit @xmath1-laws to the data .",
    "the first approach involved restoration of the data ( deconvolution ) using the clean procedure ( @xcite ) , isophote fitting using galphot ( @xcite ) , the derivation of a circularized , integrated surface brightness profile ( _ i.e _ , a `` growth '' curve ) , and its fit with an integrated @xmath1-law .",
    "the second approach involved fitting two - dimensional galaxy models to the images directly ( cf .",
    "the algorithm involves convolving two - dimensional @xmath1-laws with a psf , iteratively adjusting the parameters until the model provides a good fit to the wfpc2 images .",
    "nearby , contaminating objects can be handled elegantly , since multiple objects can be fit simultaneously ( see also simard 1998 ) . for both of these procedures we used artificial psfs for each galaxy .",
    "these psfs were created using tiny tim 4.0b ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the effects of psf errors in  [ psferr ] .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the procedures used for fitting the integrated profiles derived from the wfpc2 images . before deriving the surface photometry",
    ", the images must be deconvolved because the structural parameters @xmath2 and @xmath91 can be seriously affected by the wfpc2 psf and its broad wings .",
    "we chose to use the clean method of deconvolution because it is fast , efficient , and simple ( @xcite ) .",
    "the output images were convolved with a gaussian smoothing function to reduce the noise in the output image .",
    "the residual maps typically contained @xmath92 of the counts in the original image but were nevertheless added to the output frames in order to preserve flux .",
    "we fitted elliptical isophotes using the program galphot ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radii were spaced logarithmically , with an inner isophote radius of @xmath93 pixels , extending out to radii typically five times larger than @xmath2 .    in deriving structural parameters for our galaxies",
    ", we duplicated the procedures used on nearby galaxies , fitting the integrated profiles rather than the profiles themselves .",
    "the flux in the cleaning process has been restored with an effective psf , chosen to be a gaussian with @xmath94 pixel . at",
    "any given radius , one needs to correct the analytical @xmath1-law growth curve for the convolution by the restoration psf .",
    "the enclosed flux within a given radius for an @xmath1-law profile is analytically simple : @xmath95 the least - squares fit can be linearized straightforwardly , since the derivatives of equation [ anal4 ] , with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath91 ( or @xmath19 ) , are also analytically simple .    for a given set of structural parameters @xmath96 , one can readily compute how much interior flux should be redistributed outside of a given radius in the growth curve . in this fashion ,",
    "one adjusts the growth curve due to the smearing by the restoration psf ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . at each radius ,",
    "one computes a set of aperture corrections to correct the model to a `` seeing''-convolved model ( assuming circular symmetry ) .",
    "these corrections are determined numerically for each set of structural parameters tested in the search for @xmath97 minimum .",
    "the expression for the convolved model growth curves is @xmath98 where the restoration psf is described by its transform , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are zeroth and first order bessel functions . for @xmath102 , we use the fitted profile .",
    "we use the levenberg - marquardt method to perform the @xmath97 minimization , fitting @xmath103 to the integrated surface brightness profiles . , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the convolved and unconvolved values of the cumulative flux .",
    "] once the set of structural parameters has been found which minimizes @xmath97 , we have @xmath2 , @xmath91 , and @xmath19 for the fitted model .",
    "once the model has been fit , the galaxy profile may not be perfectly fit by the model within @xmath2 , the radius within which @xmath19 is defined .",
    "therefore , we use the observed @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ , the enclosed flux within @xmath2 for the observed profile instead of the enclosed flux for the model , and have corrected this surface brightness for the smearing effects of the restoration psf ( see equation [ seeing ] ) . using either the observed or model @xmath19 has an effect on @xmath106 of less than @xmath107 in the mean .    in figure",
    "[ profile ] , we show the calibrated f814w surface brightness profiles and integrated surface brightness profiles .",
    "the fit by the integrated de vaucouleurs profiles are shown by thick solid lines in the right - hand panels .",
    "the implied @xmath1-law profiles are shown in the left - hand panels .",
    "the residuals are shown in the lower panels , using thick solid lines as well .",
    "in general , the quality of the fit to the integrated profiles is good .      in the fitting process",
    ", one must select a range of radii over which to fit the integrated surface brightness profiles . at small radii ,",
    "the profile shapes are affected by psf errors which may have been exacerbated by the ( de)convolution procedures .",
    "secondly , at large radii the profiles themselves become noisy , and thus the growth curve shapes can become suspect .",
    "three effects limit the choice of inner radius in the fit : ( 1 ) the clean procedure may not be perfect and noiseless ; ( 2 ) the tiny tim construction of the wfpc2 psf may not be perfect ; and ( 3 ) the correction for the smearing by the restoration psf may not be perfect .",
    "these effects are exacerbated by the under - sampling of the data .",
    "the outer radius was chosen in order to minimize the effects of sky - subtraction errors .",
    "the shape of a galaxy s outer profile can be greatly affected by errors in the sky background , even though fitting of a parameterized growth curve is intended to be robust against such uncertainties .",
    "we find that the results are quite stable to the choice of inner and outer fitting radii .",
    "we varied the outer fitting radius between @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and the inner fitting radius between 0 , 0.5 , 1 pixel , and 2 pixels .",
    "( for @xmath3 -1 and @xmath4 , one wfpc2 pixel corresponds to @xmath111 kpc , equivalent to @xmath112 at the distance of coma . ) for all combinations of the fitting range , mean and median differences in @xmath2 are less than @xmath113 .",
    "we found that @xmath114 was a suitable compromise for the outer radius in fitting the growth curve . after investigating the uncertainties due to psf errors and the under - sampling (  [ psferr ] ) , we adopted an inner fitting radius of @xmath115 pixel .    in the extreme case",
    ", changing the inner and outer fitting radii to @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the mean systematic offset in @xmath2 is about 1% , with an  scatter in the @xmath2 values of @xmath118 .",
    "the systematic offset in @xmath119 , the combination of the structural parameters which appears in the fundamental plane , is negligible , with an  scatter of 0.1% .",
    "the stability of the effective radii to the inner fitting boundary gives us confidence that the procedure outlined above properly corrects for the convolution by the restoration psf .",
    "one important source of error not addressed by varying the inner and outer fitting radii was uncertainties in the determination of the sky background .",
    "when the imaging data were processed in van dokkum ( 1998a ) , the background was modeled and subtracted using order @xmath37 polynomials .",
    "however , for any given galaxy there may still be residual background fluctuations that were not accurately removed by the modeling .",
    "thus , we followed the procedure in jrgensen  ( 1992 ) , where low - order power laws ( @xmath120 ) are fit to the outer parts of the profiles using an unweighted least - squares routine .",
    "the sky value is estimated from the asymptotic convergence of @xmath121 .",
    "the  scatter in extrapolated sky values was 5@xmath122 ( 24 mag/@xmath123 ) . by ignoring this fit for the local background , the effect on @xmath2",
    "is about 1% , in the mean , with a standard deviation of 3% .",
    "no effect on the fundamental plane parameters was found .    in summary ,",
    "the fundamental plane parameters derived from the fitting of the integrated profiles , for all combinations of the inner and outer fitting radii , are extremely robust against the choice of fitting range .",
    "the insensitivity to the fitting range and to uncertainties in the sky subtraction suggest to us that the growth - curve parameters are well - determined .      in this section ,",
    "we derive structural parameters by fitting two - dimensional model galaxies directly to the wfpc2 images ( see @xcite for a discussion of the technique used here , and other authors for variants of the method _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "images of model galaxies , for a given set of structural parameters , are convolved with the tiny tim psfs and compared directly to the data frames .",
    "the structural parameters are adjusted until @xmath97 , or some other measure of the goodness of fit , is minimized .",
    "the local topology of @xmath97 is generally used to estimate the uncertainties in the fit .",
    "procedures for fitting the images directly have the advantage that one performs a convolution rather than deconvolution .",
    "the advantages of such a process include the preservation of the image s noise characteristics , and the fitting of multiple objects simultaneously .",
    "the current disadvantage is that the 2d models are built using a single , global ellipticity and position angle for each galaxy . nonetheless , as the apparent information content continues to shrink with the decreasing angular sizes of high redshift galaxies , useful structural parameters are still extractable via such modeling , so long as the psf is reasonably well known .",
    "such fitting methods assume a functional form to the galaxy profile , such as an @xmath1-law , but can be expanded to include multiple components ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath1-law bulge plus exponential disk ) .",
    "the parameters of the least - squares fit to an @xmath1-law are : ( 1 ) @xmath124 position of the center ; ( 2 ) @xmath125 , the apparent ellipticity ; ( 3 ) position angle ; ( 4 ) effective radius ; ( 5 ) surface brightness at the effective radius ; and ( 6 ) the sky background . multiple - component ( _ e.g. _ , bulge - plus - disk ) fits require additional parameters and complicated minimization algorithms , but even such expanded profile shapes do not yet take into account deviations from purely elliptical isophote shapes , or twisting of the isophotes with radius .",
    "using the fitting procedure of van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) , we derived the @xmath1-law structural parameters for the galaxies .",
    "given the potential uncertainties in the processing of the sky background in the ccd images , we performed the fitting first with the sky background fixed at zero , and a second time while fitting for the local sky background . when the sky background is fit , the @xmath2 changes by a mean ( median ) of @xmath126 @xmath127 , with a scatter of nearly @xmath128 .",
    "the additional fitting of local sky has a negligible effect on the fundamental plane parameter in the mean ( @xmath129 ) , with a scatter of @xmath130 .",
    "for some galaxies , @xmath2 could change by as much as 30 - 40% , but even for these extreme cases the fundamental plane parameter only changes by @xmath131 .    in figure [ residuals ] , we show the galaxy images , after subtraction with the best - fit 2d @xmath1-law models .",
    "many disk - like structures are clearly visible in these residuals and bulge - plus - disk fits to the 1d profiles are discussed in  [ scomp ] .",
    "ideally the two fitting procedures should yield similar , or even identical structural parameters . in practice",
    "this will not be the case for several reasons .",
    "for example , the two procedures have intrinsically different weighting schemes in the fitting process .",
    "furthermore , galaxies do not have surface brightness profiles which obey perfectly an @xmath1-law , or any other simply parameterized function . while the internal tests listed above , such as varying the fitting range of the integrated surface brightness profiles , or allowing the image modeling to fit the sky background , help estimate some of the uncertainties in the measurements , the methods themselves suffer from their own systematics . therefore ,",
    "we now compare the structural parameters derived from the two methods in order to help estimate remaining systematic uncertainties .",
    "the comparison of effective radii derived by the two algorithms is surprisingly good , considering the range of apparent morphologies covered by the sample .",
    "the median difference in effective radii between the two algorithms is only @xmath132 .",
    "the standard deviation is @xmath133 in @xmath2 , precisely the quadrature sum of the  scatter derived in the individual internal tests .",
    "the median offset in effective surface brightness is @xmath134 .",
    "thus , there is a systematic offset in the effective fundamental plane parameter of @xmath135 , with a standard deviation of @xmath136 .",
    "nominally , one would expect that the error in the fundamental plane parameter should be smaller than the error in the individual structural parameters , because of the correlation between @xmath2 and surface brightness .",
    "however , the two fitting methods weight the data differently and are therefore affected differently by the under - sampling and psf errors , which are addressed in the next section .",
    "nevertheless , these results indicate that the errors in the fundamental plane parameters are small .",
    "while the above tests show that the fundamental plane parameters appear well constrained , there are potential sources of error in common to both methods .",
    "the two most important effects are ( 1 ) the under - sampling ; and ( 2 ) the use of model point - spread functions .",
    "even those these effects are common to both methods , the data are weighted differently in the @xmath97 calculation . as a result ,",
    "the two fitting methods are not affected identically .      in order to test the effects of under - sampling , and the dependence of the psf on sub - pixel positioning , we generated a @xmath137 subsampled tiny tim psf .",
    "we created a set of noiseless subsampled @xmath1-law galaxy images using the subsampled psfs .",
    "we then created two sets of wf ccd sampled versions of these model galaxies .",
    "the first set were simply block - averaged to the nominal wf ccd sampling and convolved with a charge - smearing kernel ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the galaxy centroids were located at the precise corner of a wf ccd pixel .",
    "the second set were created by shifting the subsampled model galaxy images by @xmath138 ( half a wf ccd pixel ) , then block - averaged , and convolved with the charge - smearing kernel . in each case , the block - averaged subsampled psfs are equivalent to the ( under-)sampled , real ones .",
    "thus , we had two sets of model galaxy images which differed in position by half a wf ccd pixel .",
    "we then used the nominally sampled tiny tim psf , centered at the integer pixel location , to derive structural parameters for these galaxies .",
    "the model images were analyzed in the same manner as the cl1358 + 62 galaxies , as described in  [ growthfit ] and  [ r4fit ] .",
    "the systematic errors in @xmath2 varied with galaxy size , as did the errors in @xmath119 . for @xmath139 pixels ,",
    "the error in the fundamental plane parameter was only @xmath140 . for @xmath141 pixels ,",
    "the error is @xmath142 . for these tests",
    ", we restricted the growth curve fitting to radii @xmath143 pixel . by fitting to the very center ,",
    "the systematic error in @xmath119 was nearly @xmath144 for galaxies as small as @xmath141 pixels . even by directly fitting the images with the two - dimensional models , the derived structural parameters are susceptible to errors due to the under - sampling . for galaxies with @xmath145 pixel",
    ", the systematic errors due to under - sampling can be as large as @xmath39 in @xmath2 , and @xmath146 in @xmath147 .",
    "fortunately , the smallest galaxy in our sample has @xmath148 pixels ; the median effective radius is @xmath149 pixels .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the net systematic effect of the under - sampling on the fundamental plane is small , being 1 - 2% on average .",
    "we caution against fitting profiles or growth curves too close to the centers of galaxies , even when deconvolution of the wfpc2 images has taken place , because the under - sampling makes fitting small galaxies quite problematic .",
    "techniques which improve the sampling , such as `` drizzling '' ( @xcite ) should improve the usefulness of the data for such objects .      in both procedures ,",
    "we have relied on the assumption that the tiny tim point - spread function ( @xcite ) is an accurate match to the psf of the observations .",
    "even when this assumption is be correct for a single exposure , the process of combining multiple exposures in each pointing introduces extra `` jitter '' in the psf of the resulting image .",
    "the situation is actually worse because one has only a finite number of images , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath150 , and not the limit of @xmath151 images .",
    "therefore the individual jitter vectors are not going to be isotropically distributed , for each galaxy ( or star ) in a given pointing .",
    "therefore , we tested to what extent our results are effected by errors in the model psf .",
    "we built model galaxy images using a bright star as the _ observed _ psf , and then analyzed these images using a tiny tim model psf .",
    "the star was located at approximately @xmath152 in ccd @xmath153 of pointing @xmath154 .",
    "we performed this test using observed stellar and tiny tim psfs with @xmath80 diameter .",
    "we generated a @xmath137 subsampled model psf at the integral pixel location of the star , shifted and resampled it to the pixel size of the wf ccds , and then convolved with the charge - smearing kernel .",
    "we measured the flux - weighted centroid of this nominally sampled psf and adjusted the sub - pixel shift until its centroid coincided with that of the star .",
    "the effects due to under - sampling in the star and tiny tim point - spread functions should cancel out , because they are positioned at identical sub - pixel locations ( to within 5% of a pixel ) .",
    "we created a set of 2d model galaxy images which had been convolved with the stellar image .",
    "the models had pure @xmath1-law profiles with effective radii @xmath155 pixels .",
    "using the sub - pixel shifted tiny tim psf , we then measured the structural parameters of the model using the direct image fitting .",
    "the measured effective radii underestimated the correct values by 17% , 12% , 8% , 6% , and 4% , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the model psf was broader than the star , but because of the under - sampling , this difference in width was not initially obvious .",
    "the fundamental plane parameters were systematically larger by 6.8% , 3.6% , 1.8% , 0.8% , and 0.2% , respectively .",
    "these offsets are independent of model ellipticity .",
    "the smallest galaxy in our sample has an effective radius of @xmath156 pixels ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the median half - light radius of the sample is 06 , with 25 and 75 percentiles of 035 and @xmath112 .",
    "thus , for the upper half of the sample , the uncertainties on the fundamental plane parameters , due to improper matching of the point - spread functions , are @xmath92 . for the 25% of the sample with @xmath158 , the effects are @xmath159 . for the remainder",
    ", the uncertainty is @xmath160 . for galaxies at higher redshift , or for galaxies farther down the luminosity function , one must take extreme care to match the point - spread function to the data , given the potentially large systematic uncertainties at @xmath161 pixels .    using two distinct fitting methods ,",
    "we have reliably derived effective radii and surface brightnesses .",
    "the uncertainties in the effective radii of the de vaucouleurs profile fits are small , at the level of 13% , with a mean offset of only 1% .",
    "the measurements are robust against fitting range , uncertainties in the sky background , and fitting method .",
    "the uncertainties in the fundamental plane parameters themselves is even smaller , 2.5% , with potential systematic uncertainties at the level of @xmath159 , due to errors in the psf , under - sampling , and differences between the fitting methods .",
    "however , other sources of uncertainty in half - light radii may persist , due to deviations in galaxy profiles from the @xmath1-law form .",
    "therefore , we continue with a discussion of systematic deviations from the @xmath1-law .",
    "the actual surface brightness profiles of galaxies often deviate from pure @xmath1-laws . in the sample presented here , both bulge and disk components are readily visible in many of the images ( see figures [ images ] and [ residuals ] ) .",
    "we now investigate the fitting of more generalized surface brightness profiles to our data to test ( 1 ) if a more complex profile is better suited to the profiles of the cl1358 + 62 galaxies ; ( 2 ) if such departures from an @xmath1-law are important for the determination of their structural parameters ; and ( 3 ) if they allow for accurate and objective morphological classification .    in this section ,",
    "we generalize the parameterization of the surface brightness profiles to the @xmath5-law ( @xcite ) , where @xmath6 , in the case of this paper , is restricted to the set of integers @xmath162 .",
    "note that the case of @xmath7 corresponds to an exponential disk , and @xmath163 is equal to the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath6 serves two purposes .",
    "first , the best - fit @xmath6 is a a quantitative descriptor of galaxy morphology .",
    "graham  ( 1997 ) found that the giant cluster ellipticals and bcgs follow @xmath164 profiles .",
    "furthermore , saglia  ( 1997 ) showed that @xmath5 is equivalent to a subset of bulge - plus - disk models , though the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath165 is not a straightforward one .",
    "integrated @xmath5-laws , with @xmath166 have been fit to the growth curves of  [ growthfit ] . the enclosed flux within a given radius for an @xmath5-law profile can be simply expressed : @xmath167 where @xmath168 refers to the half - light radius of the corresponding @xmath5-law fit .",
    "fundamental plane parameters will be expressed as @xmath169 and @xmath170 .    as in the case of the de vaucouleurs fitting ( @xmath163 )",
    ", we adopt structural parameters derived from an inner fitting radius of 1 pixel , and an outer radius of @xmath171 .",
    "we tested the structural parameters from these fitting functions with direct image model fitting using the @xmath5-laws for a restricted set of @xmath6 ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "comparisons of the structural parameters derived from the image and growth - curve fitting for @xmath173 were similar to the comparisons for @xmath163 discussed in  [ growthvsdirect ] ( in which differences in @xmath174 were 1.5% in the mean , with 2.5%  scatter ) .      by expanding our growth curve fitting to a range of profile shapes , one expects to gain additional knowledge about the galaxy sizes and morphologies . in this section",
    ", we investigate whether or not the new measures of half - light radii are necessarily more accurate than those obtained with the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "figure [ rrat](a ) shows the distribution of the ratio @xmath175 ( where @xmath176 ) using the best - fit @xmath6 for a given galaxy .",
    "this distribution is quite broad , suggesting that the fit of a pure de vaucouleurs profile can lead to large errors in half - light radius , similar to what has been found for nearby samples ( @xcite ) .    for a given @xmath6 ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath177 appears to be a well defined function .",
    "as shown in figure [ sfn](a ) , @xmath178 , almost irrespective of the true shape of the galaxies , with a scatter of less 5% .",
    "thus , the fit of an @xmath179 profile to an intrinsically @xmath180 galaxy will find too large a half - light radius by nearly a factor of three . as a result ,",
    "a large bulk of an @xmath179 profile is fit to parts of the growth curve which are more susceptible to errors in the sky subtraction . in crowded regions , where a large source of systematic error is the background determination , residual background light can easily appear as a shallow envelope in the integrated surface brightness profiles , masquerading as the profile of an @xmath181-law , or worse yet , even larger values of n. of course , the other extreme is also possible . by",
    "over - estimating the sky , one can effectively decrease the @xmath6 derived for a given galaxy .",
    "therefore , when expanding the profile fitting to include the overall shape ( @xmath6 ) , one must treat the background subtraction with care .",
    "while for fixed values of @xmath6 , the individual parameters of @xmath168 and @xmath182 are not particularly sensitive to errors in background subtraction ( see the earlier case of @xmath163 ) , the chief uncertainty is _ which _ value of @xmath6 to assign to a given galaxy . by varying the range of radii over which one",
    "compares the different @xmath5 fits , one begins to test the sensitivity of @xmath6 to the uncertainties in sky subtraction . a 3% error in sky subtraction (  [ deriv ] ) can lead to changes in @xmath6 , @xmath183 , and errors in half - light radius of 20 - 30% .",
    "the typical scatter introduced in @xmath6 due to the sky extrapolation alone is of order @xmath184 .",
    "nearly a third of the sample , however , have @xmath185 values larger than this , and many of these are the @xmath186 galaxies for which uncertainties in @xmath6 on the order of unity are not uncommon .",
    "we adopt @xmath185 as the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath6 , and the faintest galaxies , as expected , tend to have the largest uncertainties . we conclude that the @xmath5-law does not yield more accurate estimates of half - light radii , especially for galaxies fit by @xmath187 .",
    "several authors have commented upon a trend of galaxy shape parameter , `` @xmath6 , '' with galaxy size ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in figure [ sfn](a ) we saw that the ratio of @xmath177 scales in a well - defined manner . by fitting a low-@xmath6 profile to a galaxy ,",
    "one will automatically find a smaller half - light radius than when fitting a larger @xmath6 profile .",
    "the half - light radii from low-@xmath6 fits are simply smaller than the half - light radii one derives when fitting larger-@xmath6 profiles , independent of the true shape of the galaxy profile",
    ". this bias may complicate the nature of the trend of @xmath6 with galaxy size .",
    "ideally , the fundamental plane should be insensitive to the detailed profiles of ( early - type ) galaxies .",
    "however , the fundamental plane parameter constructed with the surface brightness at an effective radius is not robust .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ sfn](b ) , the ratio of @xmath188 to @xmath189 is a factor of @xmath109 . the ratios of the @xmath190 to each other are _ independent of the real shapes of the galaxy profiles _ , to better than a few percent . in figure [ sfn](c ) , however , we see that the fundamental plane parameter constructed with the _ mean surface brightness _ ( within @xmath168 ) is much more robust with respect to @xmath6 , showing only @xmath191 peak - to - peak difference in @xmath192",
    ". the typical scatter about this relation is only a few percent .",
    "the ratio of @xmath170 to @xmath193 is virtually independent of galaxy profile as well .",
    "this indicates that every @xmath180 galaxy fit by a de vaucouleurs profile is actually measured incorrectly in precisely the same way as every other @xmath180 galaxy , independent of galaxy size .    in summary ,",
    "the fitting of the sersic @xmath5-law profiles does not lead to more accurate photometric parameters for the purposes of fundamental plane analysis .",
    "the derived half - light radii are correlated with the best - fit @xmath6 , which is sensitive to errors in the sky background .",
    "fortunately , the fundamental plane is insensitive to these uncertainties in the photometric parameters , because the fundamental plane parameters , when constructed using mean effective surface brightnesses , remain constant at the level of 3% .",
    "classifying galaxies by morphology becomes increasingly difficult at high redshifts .",
    "distant galaxies are typed using images taken with ( linear ) ccd detectors , while nearby samples have been primarily typed using ( non - linear ) photographic plates .",
    "furthermore , the distant galaxies typically span fewer resolution elements , and the images have poorer @xmath17 than images of the nearby prototype elliptical and lenticular galaxies with which we wish to make comparisons . in order to maximize the use of our data in determining galaxy morphologies",

    "the visual classifications have been taken from fabricant  ( 1999 ) .    in the previous section , we derived the @xmath6 parameters for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "as stated earlier , the sersic ( 1968 ) @xmath6 profiles are a `` restricted '' subset of bulge - plus - disk models ( @xcite ) . in fitting the growth curves , the use of @xmath6 as a descriptor of morphology is formally more robust than bulge - disk decompositions .",

    "most of the galaxies with larger bulge fractions show evidence for central exponential components in their surface brightness profiles .",
    "this does not appear to be an artifact of the fitting procedures or errors in the psf , as many of these central `` disk '' components persist at radii @xmath198 pixel .",
    "evidence of such structures might appear in the kinematic profiles but seeing would complicate the interpretation of such data ( @xcite ) .",

    "the slope running parallel to the fundamental plane , @xmath220 , is shown by the solid line .",

    "half of the sample shows evidence for disky structures after subtracting two - dimensional @xmath1-law models from the galaxy images .",

    "<S> using wide - field , two - color hst imaging of the cluster cl1358 + 62 ( @xmath0 ) , we derive structural parameters for a large , magnitude - limited sample of cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> these structural parameters are combined with accurate velocity dispersions in another paper to investigate the fundamental plane in the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we fit integrated @xmath1-laws to the integrated surface brightness profiles , and fit two - dimensional @xmath1-law model galaxies to the images directly . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the results from the two methods shows that the derived half - light radii , @xmath2 , agree very well , with an  scatter of only 13% . the half - light radii range from approximately 1 to 20 kpc , with a median of about 3 kpc ( @xmath3 - 1 , @xmath4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the stability of @xmath2 by comparing the @xmath1-law fits to the half - light radii derived using other commonly used surface brightness profiles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we fit sersic @xmath5-laws ( finding the best - fit @xmath6 ranging between @xmath7-@xmath8 ) and superpositions of @xmath1-law bulges with exponential disks . </S>",
    "<S> the half - light radii derived from the best - fit sersic profiles varied with respect to @xmath2 from the @xmath1-law fits by only 1% in the median , but with a standard deviation of more than 40% in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for the bulge - plus - disk fits , the derived half - light radii were offset from @xmath2 of the @xmath1-law fits by 10% in the mean , also showing a large standard deviation of more than 40% . by comparing the fitted half - light radii from the sersic laws with those derived from the bulge - plus - disk fitting , one also finds a large scatter of 30% . </S>",
    "<S> based on these tests , we conclude that , in general , half - light radii are only measured with a typical accuracy of 30 - 40% .    while there are large uncertainties in half - light radii , these do not impact the subsequent fundamental plane analysis because the combination @xmath9 , which enters the fundamental plane , is extremely stable . </S>",
    "<S> the  scatter in @xmath10 is less than 3% , regardless of the form of the profile fit to the galaxies .    by fitting bulge - plus - disk profiles , we find that the median bulge fraction of the sample is 84% and that the few e+a galaxies in this sample have disks which make up about 10 - 35% of their total light . </S>",
