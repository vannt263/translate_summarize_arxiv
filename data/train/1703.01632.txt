    "post - selected weak measurements have proven to be useful for metrology of parameter estimation during the recent years  @xcite .",
    "these techniques consist of weakly coupling a system to an ancillary meter and then measuring the meter only when a successful post - selection on the system occurs . weak - value amplification ( wva )",
    "is one such technique , where strong discarding of data is part of the requirements to induce a large signal proportional to the parameter of interest .",
    "the technique was initially proposed almost thirty years ago  @xcite , and has been extensively studied and applied after the first experimental demonstration twenty years later  @xcite .",

    "it was also shown than a wva - like response can be obtained in the difference signal of the two - detector protocol  @xcite . simulating an anomalous amplification in a homodyne detection procedure",
    ", the technique has been dubbed almost - balanced weak values ( abwv ) .",
    "the abwv technique has been used to measure angular velocities of the linear polarization of laser pulses with a precision of 22 nrad / s after @xmath011 hours of integration time  @xcite , and more recently , to measure angular velocities of a rotating mirror with a precision of @xmath04.9 nrad / s with one minute of collection time  @xcite .",
    "wva has been successfully used to measure ultra - small linear velocities of a moving mirror in a michelson interferometer on a table - top configuration  @xcite .",

    "@xmath3 is the peak power and @xmath4 is the characteristic length of the pulse . the piezo - mounted mirror can be precisely controlled to set the optical outputs in a bright / dark or an almost balanced configuration .",
    "the wva configuration is obtained by tracking only the dark port .",
    "this arrangement is done by setting one output beam as the bright port and then blocking it to avoid its detection .",

    "the parameter @xmath9 is the relative transmission amplitude between both arms of the interferometer at the given port .",

    "[ fig : shifts ] , we notice the following : first , the abwv technique offers larger amplification ( i.e. larger time shifts ) than wva , and second , the amplification monotonically grows for small values of @xmath6 ( wva breaks down for @xmath41 rad ) .",
    "the former was noted when the technique was originally proposed  @xcite , and the latter was subsequently experimentally demonstrated  @xcite . for a given frequency @xmath30 ( and velocity @xmath7 ) ,",

    "the maximum amplification in the abwv case was on average 13 times larger than the optimal case in wva .",
    "the lowest amplification ratio was 5.7 for @xmath42 mhz and the largest was 21 for @xmath43 hz .",
    "these amplification gain differences are due to the experimentally - allowed minimum values for @xmath6 obtained in the abwv case for each frequency @xmath30 .",
    "it is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shifts ] that the abwv technique shows a relatively consistent precision ( size of error bars ) for all data points .",

    "the abwv case ( blue circles ) offers in average @xmath44 larger signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) than the wva case ( red squares ) .",

    "values for the abwv ( wva ) case are represented as blue circles ( red squares ) . ]",
    "the consistency of the snr results of the abwv technique over the wva technique relies on technical details that makes the implementation of the almost - balanced case advantageous .",
    "these advantages are :    * the abwv protocol is more robust to slow fluctuations of the input laser power than the wva one .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath3 must be independently measured in the wva case before setting the interferometer in the dark port . for the abwv case",
    ", we approximated eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) as @xmath45 since @xmath27 , and obtained real - time values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for each pulse .",
    "this fact alone allows for longer collection times in the abwv case . in order to improve the estimates for the wva case , we separately estimated the power drift of the 118 pulses collected for each data point in fig .",
    "[ fig : shifts ] .",
    "we then corrected for the drift in eq .",
    "( [ wva ] ) before running the numerical fittings .",
    "the drift - subtracted results for wva are not better than the raw fittings for abwv , as shown in fig .",

    "a systematic error - free estimation of @xmath9 , @xmath39 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 were performed from numerical fittings to the difference signal in eq .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we conclude that the technique of abwv is more robust to slow drifts than wva , and it also offers background subtraction . as a result , the technique gives one the possibility for longer collection times and larger signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we proceed now to improve the state - of - the - art wva result for velocity measurements . by averaging 78 pulses in a similar configuration to fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , the best reported averaged velocity in ref .",
    "@xcite was of 400@xmath46400 fm / s .",
    "such a result gives a sensitivity of @xmath47 pm / s per averaged pulse when using wva .",
    "in our case , using abwv , we set a frequency of @xmath482.5 mhz , a voltage on the piezo of @xmath490.3 mv , and a time constant of @xmath50 s. we used an average value of @xmath51 mrad for 358 collected pulses and obtained a estimated average velocity of 380 @xmath46 60 fm / s .",
    "the obtained sensitivity was of @xmath52 pm / s per averaged pulse . note that 358 pulses at a repetition rate of 2.5 mhz corresponds to a total acquisition time of about 40 hours .",
    "as a merit of comparison , our precision in velocity corresponds to a doppler shift in the laser light of @xmath53 nhz .",
    "measuring such a shift in a standard continuous - wave homodyne configuration would produce a beat note of about 11 weeks !",
    "we have compared the recently - proposed technique of using two detectors to subtract the signals produced by two almost - equal weak values ( abwv ) to the better known technique of amplification due to one large anomalous weak value ( wva ) .",
    "we performed precision measurements of linear velocities of one of the mirrors in a michelson interferometer , and further expand the already - known advantages of the abwv technique over wva .",
    "we confirm that practical advantages of balancing signals make the abwv technique more robust against slow drifts and systematic errors than the wva protocol .",
    "the technique of abwv offers larger signal - to - noise ratios than wva , however the well - behaved range for the parameter @xmath6 extends only up to @xmath54 rad . on the other hand ,",
    "the technique of wva breaks down for angles below @xmath54 rad , but it offers good performance for angles above it .",
    "small values of @xmath6 are always desired in weak - values metrological techniques .",
    "however , we have found here that abwv and wva complement each other to allow precision measurements for almost any given value of @xmath6 in the range from 10 to 800 mrad ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shifts ] ) .",
    "we were able to measure a doppler shift of @xmath0950 nhz with a precision of @xmath55 nhz after 40 hours of integration time .",
    "we note that the competitive techniques of continuous - wave homodyne detection would require at least 11 weeks to resolve the corresponding beating signal .",
    "experimental demonstrations of the abwv technique have been done for measurements of time shifts in pulses  @xcite , as we do here .",
    "the technique of wva has successfully been used in configurations that require split detection to track the field s transverse distribution of a continuous - wave laser beam . as a future work",
