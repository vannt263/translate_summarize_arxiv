    "<S> although our analytical analysis focuses on the vicinity of the bragg point , the asymptotic decay is characteristic of the majorana states in the entire topological phase when @xmath100 as previously established numerically @xcite . figure [ fig : wv](c ) shows that the analytical solution ( [ inverse_laplace ] ) is in excellent agreement with numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> _ nontopological phase._when the bragg point @xmath43 falls into the topological phase for finite @xmath5 [ i.e. , along the yellow line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : beff](a ) ] , the nontopological side of the phase transition ( @xmath101 ) can be understood as an effective two - channel wire @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this phase exhibits two subgap states for each end . in long chains , @xmath102 , </S>",
    "<S> their wavefunction and energy can be obtained analytically by an extension of the technique used for @xmath103 . here , we sketch the results and defer details to the supplementary material @xcite .    the two positive - energy subgap states become degenerate for large @xmath104 and to leading order in @xmath105 , we find that their energy scales as @xmath106 , consistent with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wv](a ) . similarly , the nambu wavefunction @xmath51 for the state at the left end @xcite has @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with @xmath82 the exponential solution at the critical point and @xmath90 a power - law tail @xmath109 as for @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron component @xmath111 decays exponentially with a decay length which diverges for @xmath112 , reflecting the phase transition and the disappearance of one subgap state . </S>",
    "<S> the hole component @xmath113 smoothly evolves into the majorana bound state on the topological side .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions._as a consequence of the long - range coupling , helical shiba chains display an unconventional topological critical point at the bragg point @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for finite chains , the majorana end states persist at the critical point and display remarkable localization properties . by the competition between bragg reflection and long - range coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the majorana end states are exponentially localized at the critical point but develop a power - law tail in the topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts in an interesting way with the decay of correlations around conventional critical points .    </S>",
    "<S> this is also an encouraging prediction for experiment , as the exponential localization at the critical point is on the scale of the lattice spacing and entirely unrelated to a topological gap . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the majorana end states may remain well localized even in chains whose length is comparable to the coherence length of the host superconductor . at the same time , the power - law localization within the topological phase raises interesting questions with regard to its stability against perturbations such as disorder .    _ </S>",
