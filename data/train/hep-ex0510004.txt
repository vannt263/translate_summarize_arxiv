    "the na48/2 experiment at the cern sps is searching for the charge asymmetry in the decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the experiment uses two simultaneous oppositely charged beams with a central momentum of 60 gev / c and a momentum band @xmath5 , propagating along the same beam line .",
    "the decay volume is a 114 m long vacuum tank with a diameter of 1.92 m for the first 66 m , and 2.4 m for the rest .",
    "the detected particles are dominated by the @xmath6 decay products .",
    "charged particles are measured by the magnetic spectrometer , consisting of four drift chambers @xcite and a dipole magnet , located between the second and third chambers .",
    "charged particles are magnetically deflected in the horizontal plane by an angle corresponding to momentum kick of 120 mev / c .",
    "the momentum resolution of the spectrometer is @xmath7 ( @xmath8 in gev / c ) .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer is followed by a scintillator hodoscope consisting of two planes segmented into horizontal and vertical strips and arranged in four quadrants .",
    "a liquid krypton calorimeter @xcite is used to reconstruct @xmath9 decays .",
    "it is segmented transversally into @xmath10 cm cells by a system of cu - be electrodes .",
    "the calorimeter is 27 @xmath11 thick and absorbs the electromagnetic showers almost completely .",
    "its energy resolution for gamma - quanta is @xmath12 e in gev .",
    "the space resolution for single electromagnetic showers can be parametrized as @xmath13 cm for each transverse coordinate @xmath14 .",
    "a neutral hodoscope consisting of a plane of scintillating fibres is installed in the liquid krypton calorimeter at a depth @xmath15 .",
    "it is divided into four quadrants , each consisting of eight bundles of vertical fibres optically connected to photomultiplier tubes .",
    "data have been collected in 2003 and 2004 , providing samples of about @xmath16 @xmath4 decays . here",
    "we report the analysis results of a partial sample @xmath17 decays recorded in 2003 .",
    "@xmath1 decays are selected by a two - level trigger .",
    "the first level requires a signal in at least one quadrant of the scintillator hodoscope in coincidence with the presence of energy depositions in calorimeter consistent with at least two photons . at the second level ,",
    "a fast on - line processor reconstructs the momentum of charged tracks and calculates the missing mass , assuming the decay @xmath18 of a 60 gev / c kaon flying along the beam axis .",
    "the requirement that the mass of missed system @xmath19 is not consistent with the @xmath20 rejects the main @xmath21 background .",
    "events with at least one charged particle having a momentum above 5 gev / c , and at least four energy deposit clusters in liquid krypton calorimeter , each above the energy threshold of 3 gev and close in time to the track , are selected for the further analysis . the distance between any two photons in calorimeter",
    "is required to be larger than 10 cm , and the distance between each photon and the impact point of any track on calorimeter must exceed 15 cm .",
    "fiducial cuts on the distance of each photon from the calorimeter edges and centre are applied to avoid the shower energy leakage .",
    "the distance between the charged particle track and the beam axis at the first drift chamber is required to be larger than 12 cm .    for each possible pair of photons",
    "we assume that it originates from @xmath22 decay , and calculate the distance between the decay vertex and the front plane of calorimeter :    @xmath23}}{m_{\\pi^0}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the energies of the two photons and @xmath14 are their impact point coordinates on calorimeter .",
    "the two photon pairs with the smallest @xmath26 difference are selected as the best combination consistent with two @xmath20 mesons from @xmath1 decay , and the arithmetic average of two @xmath27 values is used as the decay vertex position .",
    "the final event selection requires that the @xmath28 invariant mass differs from the pdg charged kaon mass by at most @xmath29 mev .",
    "the invariant mass of @xmath30 subsystem ( @xmath31 ) in @xmath32 decays has been studied to search for possible anomaly at the threshold region : @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ s2_1](a ) shows the @xmath31 distribution , without any acceptance correction , for the selected events .",
    "fig.[s2_1](b ) shows the same distribution in the region close to the threshold @xmath34 .",
    "the slope change at the threshold is clearly visible .",
    "such an anomaly has not been observed in previous experiments .",
    "the sudden change of slope observed in this plot suggests the presence of a threshold `` cusp '' effect from the decay @xmath35 contributing to the @xmath32 amplitude through the charge exchange reaction @xmath36 .",
    "the presence of a cusp at @xmath37 in @xmath30 elastic scattering due to the effect of virtual @xmath38 loops has been discussed first by meiner et al .",
    "for the case of @xmath32 decay cabibbo @xcite has proposed a simple re - scattering model describing the decay amplitude as the sum of two terms representing `` unperturbed amplitude '' and contribution from the @xmath35 decay amplitude through @xmath36 charge exchange .",
    "the latter contribution is proportional to @xmath39 , the s - wave @xmath40 charge exchange scattering length . in the limit of exact isospin symmetry @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the @xmath44 scattering lengths in the i=0 and i=2 states , respectively .",
    "recently cabibbo and isidori @xcite have proposed a more complete model , that takes into account all rescattering processes in two - loop approximation . in the limit of exact isospin symmetry",
    "the amplitude depends on five s - wave scattering lengths , that can be expressed as linear combinations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this model have been used in order to extract @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the fit to the data .",
    "the decay amplitude depends not on @xmath45 only , but also on the two @xmath46 masses squared @xmath47 .",
    "we replace them with the average values to avoid multidimensional integration in the fit procedure :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 .    in order to extract the decay amplitude parameters , the following function @xmath50 of the measured @xmath0 mass was fitted to the experimental @xmath51 spectrum :    @xmath52    here @xmath53 is the theoretical distribution from @xcite of kaon decays over the true value of two - pion invariant mass @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is the function , describing the experimental setup resolution and acceptance , that is obtained by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the fit by this model in the interval @xmath56 allows to extract four parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( the slope ) , @xmath60 ( a quadratic term in the dalitz distribution over @xmath61 variable ) and one parameter for normalization .",
    "it leads to @xmath62 for 146 degrees of freedom .",
    "the better fit ( @xmath63 ) is obtained by adding to the model a term describing the expected formation of a @xmath38 atom ( `` pionium '' ) decaying into @xmath30 at @xmath64 .",
    "the fit value for the rate of @xmath65 decays is @xmath66 , which is in good agreement with the predicted value @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "sensitivity of the measured @xmath57 to the pionium production branching ratio is rather small : @xmath68 .",
    "the model used do not include radiative corrections , which are particularly important near @xmath69 , and contribute to the formation of the pionium .",
    "for this reason a group of seven consecutive bins with the width of @xmath70 , centered at @xmath64 have been excluded from the fit in one of the versions of analysis .",
    "in such a case the measured @xmath57 value becomes lower by 0.008 , that is taken into account as the contribution to the systematical error .",
    "there were made three independent analyses which use different event selection criteria and different monte carlo simulations to take into account acceptance and resolution effects .",
    "two of them use a fast monte carlo code , tuned to the experimental resolutions and taking into account the geometry and kinematics . for the third analysis",
    "the full scale geant - based @xcite simulation of the detector is implemented . in all the analyses",
    "the extensive checks for the accordance between the simulation results and data have been made .",
    "the difference between two simulations leads to slightly different second derivative of the acceptance as a function of @xmath31 , that does nt affect the parameter @xmath57 .",
    "study of systematics shows that no corrections are needed .",
    "however , the corresponding uncertainties were taken into account .",
    "for measured @xmath57 parameter the major ones are shown in the table [ system ] .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      +",
    "a critical parameter of the models @xcite and @xcite is the ratio @xmath71 between weak amplitudes of @xmath35 and @xmath32 decays . the corresponding `` external '' uncertainty should be complemented by an additional theoretical error of @xmath72 as the result of neglecting higher - order terms and radiative corrections .",
    "this value is compatible withing the errors with the results obtained in the e865 bnl @xcite and the dirac @xcite experiments , as well as with the chpt calculation result @xcite , @xcite ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "it is also in good agreement with the result of fit to low energy experimantal data using dispersion relations @xcite ( @xmath75 ) .    in the forthcoming stages of analysis we plan to decrease the systematical uncertainty and to take into account the isospin symmetry breaking . at tree level , omitting the one - photon exchange diagrams , isospin symmetry breaking contributions to the elastic @xmath44 scattering amplitude can be expressed as a function of one parameter @xmath76 @xcite . in particular , the amplitudes at the threshold of @xmath77 mass are corrected by a factor of @xmath78 for the processes @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; by @xmath82 for @xmath83 ; and by @xmath84 for @xmath36 .",
    "implementing of such a correction will lead to the corresponding decrease of measured @xmath57 .",
