    "lattice fermion systems in _ one _ dimension can be studied successfully by various different methods and are by - now well understood .",
    "one powerful approach is to perform a particular continuum limit leading to a low - energy effective model which can be solved analytically .",
    "this limit amounts to linearizing the 1d tight - binding band relation at the locations of the non - interacting fermi surface ( consisting of two points ) and then removing the ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff . in the simplest case of spinless lattice fermions with short - range interactions away from half - filling ,",
    "one thus obtains the luttinger model @xcite which can be solved exactly using bosonization @xcite ; see @xcite for closely related pioneering work .",
    "it is worth stressing that exact solubility means a lot in this case : not only the partition function but also all green s functions of the model can be computed by analytical methods ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "this method can be generalized to 1d hubbard type systems and is the basis of a paradigm for 1d interacting fermion systems @xcite ; see e.g.@xcite for a textbook presentation .",
    "we note that bosonization is based on precise mathematical results ; see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a similar approach in two dimensions . starting from a 2d analogue of the spinless lattice fermion system mentioned above , we propose a particular partial continuum limit that makes this system amenable to an analytical , non - perturbative treatment in a finite doping regime away from half filling .",
    "this limit leads to a model that , as we suggest , is a natural 2d analogue of the luttinger model .",
    "different from 1d , only parts of the fermion degrees of freedom of this model can be bosonized and thus treated exactly . we propose to treat the remaining degrees of freedom using mean field theory .",
    "we also argue that there is a finite doping regime away from half filling at which these remaining degrees of freedom have an energy gap and that in this regime an exactly solvable truncation of the model can be used .",
    "our approach is applicable beyond weak coupling .",
    "previous work on bosonization in 2d @xcite is shortly discussed at the end of section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "our derivation of this 2d analogue of the luttinger model relies on approximations that we justify by physical arguments ; see section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "our proposal that this model gives a low energy effective description of 2d lattice fermions is therefore , from a mathematical point of view , a conjecture . at any rate , this model is mathematically well - defined and can be treated rigorously . to our opinion",

    "( proof outlined in section  [ sec6 ] . )    as discussed in section  [ sec6 ] , his theorem provides the means to exactly map @xmath87 to a bosons hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the model above is equivalent to a model of non - interacting bosons coupled linearly to the antinodal fermions .",
    "it is therefore possible to integrate out the nodal fermions exactly and thus obtain an effective antinodal model .",
    "we also discuss how these results can be used to obtain physical information about the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "our aim is to rewrite and modify the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model such that , ( i ) the resulting model can be treated by bosonization , ( ii ) the low energy physics is changed as little as possible . for that we adopt the following hypothesis that has been successful in 1d :    * h1 : * _ there exists some underlying fermi surface dominating the low energy physics , and we can modify , ignore or add degrees of freedom far away from this surface _ ( in the latter two cases we need to correct the definition of doping , of course ) .",
    "we note that , at half filling and without interactions , the relevant fermi surface is the square @xmath88 ( the large diamond in figure  1 ) .",
    "we assume that the underlying fermi surface remains close to this square even in the presence of interactions and away from half filling .",
    "we observe that the band relation has a qualitatively different behavior in different regions of the brillouin zone close to such a surface . to make this explicit , we select six representative points",
    "@xmath89 labeled by two indices @xmath50 and @xmath51 as follows , @xmath90 for some @xmath91 ( the dots in figure  1 ) .",
    "we then approximate the band relation close to these points by truncating the taylor series at the lowest non - trivial order , @xmath92 with @xmath93 and the constants @xmath60 and @xmath59 in ( [ vf ] ) . at half - filling",
    "we expect @xmath94 , and , for symmetry reasons , the underlying fermi surface should always contain four such points @xmath95 , @xmath50 , for some value of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the band relation is hyperbolic close to the vertices @xmath97 of the square surface , and it is linear with a constant fermi velocity @xmath59 close to the midpoints of the sides @xmath98 .",
    "we use the terminology of experimental physicists studying cuprate superconductors with arpes @xcite and refer to the regions in fourier space close to @xmath97 and @xmath98 as antinodal and nodal , respectively .",
    "as will become clear in the next section , hypothesis  h1 is not enough to justify the approximations we make . for that the following somewhat stronger hypothesis",
    "is needed .    * h1 : * _ the low energy properties of the model are not ( much ) changed if we modify the band structure and the interactions for fermion degrees of freedom far away from the six fermi surface points @xmath89 in ( [ vq ] ) .",
    "_    there are physical arguments suggesting that , at half filling and sufficiently large coupling , the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model has a charge density wave ( cdw ) groundstate which is insulating ; see e.g.  section  iv.a in ref .",
    "@xcite . in mean fields theory this state",
    "is characterized by a cdw gap @xmath99 changing the band relations to @xmath100 , and this corresponds to a fully gapped underlying fermi surface .",
    "moreover , arpes results on cuprate superconductors show that there exists an interesting doping regime away from half filling where , in these materials , the antinodal fermions are gapped while the nodal fermions have no gap but fermi surface arcs @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the nodal- and antinodal fermion degrees of freedom can have different physical behavior , and it motivates us to rewrite the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model so that nodal- and antinodal fermion degrees of freedom can be easier treated by different computation methods .",
    "the model thus obtained can be further simplified by the following hypothesis motivated by the arpes results mentioned above .    *",
    "h2 : * _ there exists a finite doping region away from half filling where the nodal points on the underlying fermi surface move to @xmath98 with @xmath101 , and in this regime the cdw gap is absent in the nodal regions while it is still present in the antinodal regions . _    in this regime , the parameter @xmath96 is determined by doping .",
    "this hypothesis is also suggested to us by results from renormalization group studies @xcite and mean field theory @xcite .",
    "we now outline a derivation of the model in ( [ hl])([mua ] ) from the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model , emphasizing the approximations that are made .",

    "we also assume @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( the latter restriction becomes irrelevant in the limit @xmath110 ) .",

    "we now make our first approximation :    * a1 : * _ taylor expand the exact band relations in the vicinity of the fermi surface points @xmath89 and keep only the leading non - trivial terms , i.e.  replace @xmath120 in @xmath121 above by @xmath122 in ( [ epsrs ] ) .",
    "_    we thus obtain @xmath123    in this approximation , we neglect terms of higher order in @xmath124 .",
    "we expect that the low energy properties of the model are dominated by states close to the fermi surface points for which these higher order terms are negligible .    to modify the interaction part of the hamiltonian in a way suitable for our purposes we use ( [ i d ] ) to rewrite @xmath125 and make our second approximation :    * a2 : * _ replace the interaction hamiltonian in ( [ hint1 ] ) by @xmath126 _",

    "the operators in ( [ rhors ] ) have the natural physical interpretation as fourier transformed density operators .",
    "it is remarkable that we only get interaction terms of density - density form .",
    "our assumption @xmath133 is important since otherwise one obtains additional terms that can not be treated in a simple manner by bosonization , similarly as in 1d @xcite .",
    "such terms might cause a nodal fermion gap .",
    "this is consistent with our hypothesis  h2 in section  [ sec4 ] since @xmath94 corresponds to half filling , as shown below .    to obtain a model that can be bosonized we want to remove the uv cutoff for the nodal fermions orthogonal to the fermi surface arcs . before we can do that we have to normal order all fermion operators with respect to some suitable reference state @xmath68 ( `` dirac sea '' ) with fixed fermion density @xmath136 .",
    "we choose this state such that the nodal fermion states are filled up to the fermi surface through the points @xmath98 parallel to the half - filled one ( the four dashed lines in figure  1 ) . for simplicity",
    "we also assume that the antinodal fermions are half - filled ( one can show that this follows from our hypothesis  h2 ) , but this is not essential ( see @xcite for a more general treatment )",
    ". this reference state can be defined by the conditions in ( [ vac ] ) _",
    "ff_. by simple geometric considerations we find that the contributions of the different regions @xmath111 to the total filling @xmath137 of this state are @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively , and thus @xmath140 .",
    "normal ordering of the hamiltonian @xmath141 amounts to the following : rewrite @xmath142 in terms of the normal ordered fermion densities @xmath143 and normal order @xmath121 and @xmath144 , dropping an irrelevant additive constant .",
    "an important consequence of this and approximation  a1 is a change of the chemical potential term @xmath145 in the hamiltonian to @xmath146 , and we find by straightforward computations the following renormalized chemical potentials : @xmath147 and @xmath148v\\equiv\\mu_n$ ] . to have an underlying fermi surface as assumed in h2 we set @xmath149 .",
    "this fixes @xmath150 and implies ( [ mua ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath62 changes sign under the transformation @xmath151 , as required by invariance under particle - hole transformations .    by assumption the groundstate expectation values of @xmath152 all are zero in the parameter regime of interest to us , and thus the filling factor of the groundstate is identical with @xmath153 .",
    "this fixes @xmath96 as in ( [ vf ] ) .",
    "we now can partially remove the uv cutoff for the nodal fermions .",
    "we do this by a sequence of three approximations :    * a3 : * _ replace in the interaction part of the hamiltonian the normal ordered nodal densities @xmath154 by @xmath155 with the cutoff functions @xmath156 in ( [ chi ] ) . _    * a4 : * _ replace the nodal fourier space regions @xmath157 by the sets @xmath158 in ( [ lrs ] ) , i.e. , drop the restriction on @xmath159 . _    * a5 : * _ replace in the interaction part of the hamiltonian the normal ordered nodal fermion densities @xmath160 by the ones in ( [ jrs ] ) , i.e.  add the umklapp terms @xmath161 parallel to the fermi surface arc . _    we thus obtain the model in ( [ hl])([mua ] ) .",
    "note that in approximations  a4 and a5 we add terms to the nodal fermion densities , and we therefore increase the number of interaction terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "approximation  a2 partly compensates for this . to be more specific : before a3",
    ", the number of terms included in the nodal fermion density @xmath162 decreases linearly with @xmath163 and @xmath164 until @xmath165 when it becomes zero .",
    "however , after a4 and a5 this number of terms becomes infinite and independent of @xmath7 .",
    "it therefore is natural to restrict the interaction terms involving nodal fermions densities by imposing a cutoff on @xmath7 .",
    "we do not know a physical argument that fixes this cutoff in a unique manner .",
    "however , we believe that the properties of the model are not sensitive to changes of this cutoff .",
    "we therefore choose here a cutoff that is particularly simple ; see @xcite for a more general treatment .",
    "our arguments above can be generalized to lattice models with more general band relations , and our choice for the regions @xmath166 can be generalized by introducing an additional parameter allowing to change the widths of the nodal regions @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not necessary to use the simplified band relations @xmath168 and interaction vertices for the antinodal fermions , and we only do this here for aesthetic reasons",
    ". it also is possible to relax hypothesis  h2 @xcite , as already mentioned",
    ".    it would be interesting to check in more detail if the approximations above indeed do not change the low energy properties of the model .",
    "this can be done , in principle , using our results : one can bosonize also the terms that we added or dropped in our approximations , and one should be able investigate the effect of these terms on the groundstate using renormalization group methods .",
    "this is an interesting project for the future .",
    "the arguments in this section can be made mathematically precise @xcite .",
    "we first outline a proof of the theorem in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "for that it is useful to formally write the model in ( [ hn])([jrs ] ) in position space as follows ( we suppress arguments @xmath169 below ) , @xmath170 for the nodal part ( @xmath171 means @xmath172 ) , and @xmath173 for the antinodal including the mixed parts , with @xmath174 the normal ordered fermion densities .",
    "the proper interpretation of these formulas follows from the precise definition of the model in fourier space : different fermion flavors @xmath175 come with different fourier space regions @xmath176 , and thus the spatial variable @xmath169 in @xmath177 lives on different spaces : for the fermions @xmath178 only the variable @xmath179 is continuous while @xmath180 lives on a 1d lattice with lattice constant @xmath181 and length @xmath10 , and similarly for @xmath182 with @xmath179 and @xmath180 interchanged ( note that the umklapp terms with @xmath161 in ( [ jrs ] ) are needed for this interpretation to be consistent with fourier transformation ) .",
    "thus the integrals here should be ( partly ) interpreted as riemann sums @xcite . in particle physics parlance",
    ", @xmath183 is a uv cutoff needed to give a precise mathematical meaning to the model .",
    "thus @xmath178 in ( [ hn1 ] ) can be treated as a collection of 1d dirac fermions where @xmath179 plays the role of the 1d space coordinate and @xmath180 of a flavor index .",
    "we therefore can use the standard mathematical results of 1d bosonization ; see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite .",
    "these imply that the densities @xmath184 obey the following commutator relations , @xmath185 = \\delta_{r , r ' } r    \\frac{1}{2\\pi{{\\rm i}}\\tilde a } \\partial_+\\delta^2({{\\bf x}}-{{\\bf y}})\\ ] ] where @xmath186 here means @xmath187 , and @xmath188 where @xmath189 stands for @xmath190 .",
    "these and similar formulas for @xmath191 imply ( [ jj ] ) and ( [ hnboson ] ) .",
    "the other relations stated in part ( a ) of the theorem in section  [ sec3 ] follow from well - known corresponding results in 1d .",
    "we now describe how to exactly diagonalize the bosonized nodal hamiltonian @xmath87 . for simplicity",
    "we continue our discussion in position space and ignore uv cutoffs that do not affect the results we mention ( a more detailed solution , including all cutoffs explicitly , can be found in @xcite ) .",

    "it is important to note that this hamiltonian is positive definite only if @xmath196 , and this implies an upper bound on the interaction strength mentioned in the theorem in section  [ sec3 ] , similarly as in 1d .",
    "fortunately , this bound is satisfied for interesting parameter values ( @xmath197 from @xmath28 up to @xmath198 or so ) .",
    "we thus obtain an exact representation of the 2d analogue of the luttinger model as a system of non - interacting bosons coupled linearly to the interacting antinodal fermions .",

    "we believe that , after bosonization , it is possible to make mathematical sense of the continuum limit @xmath209 of the nodal hamiltonian , but we expect that this requires non - trivial additive and multiplicative renormalizations , similarly as in 1d @xcite . this would give further support to our conjecture that the approximations in section  [ sec5 ] do not affect the low energy properties of the model .",
    "we argued that there exists a parameter regime away from half filling where the antinodal fermions @xmath210 are gapped .",
    "we propose that , in this regime , the nodal hamiltonian in ( [ hn ] ) alone accounts for the low energy physics of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",

    "we believe that a mean field treatment of the antinodal fermions is appropriate to compute phase diagrams .",

    "@xcite for previous work on mattis model .",
    "our work can be regarded as a particular implementation of the idea promoted by anderson @xcite that 2d interacting fermions systems can be understood by bosonization in each direction of some fermi surface .",
