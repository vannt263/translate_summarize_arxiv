    "high temperature superconductivity in cuprates has taken the centre stage of modern condensed matter physics since its discovery in 1987 because of the unusual normal state properties of these materials combined with the very rich phase diagram , besides the superconducting transition temperatures in the range of 40k-164k .",
    "these systems exhibit deviations from the fermi liquid phenomenology in large regime of stoichiometric compositions .",
    "moreover , the conventional microscopic theory is not always successful to explain the properties in the superconducting phase satisfactorily . on a phenomenological level",
    ", the behaviour below the optimal doping in the normal phase seems to display ` marginal fermi liquid ' ( mfl ) behaviour in the normal phase [ 19 ] .",
    "+ one of the most important features observed in experiments in the normal phase of the cuprates is the linear temperature dependence of dc resistivity , which below the optimal doping persists in an enormous temperature range from a few kelvin to much above room temperature . + the studies of the electrodynamic properties in the superconducting phase provide a clear phenomenological scenario , reveal information regarding the pairing state , the energy gap and the electronic density of states and",
    "thus provide important indications on the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "a phenomenological model describing the marginal fermi liquid behaviour of cuprates has been put forward by varma and co - workers but its microscopic origin remains highly controversial . to our knowledge",

    "super - electrons and normal electrons .",
    "the perfectly ordered state occurs only at zero temperature and consists of super - electrons only and 2 .",
    "the order parameter associated with the superconducting state is proportional to the number density of super - electrons and is dependent on temperature .",
    "let x represent the volume fraction of electrons belonging to the normal fluid and @xmath2 , that belonging to the superfluid .",

    "the brothers , h. london and f. london in 1935 [ 13 ] gave a phenomenological description of the electrodynamic properties of superconductors by proposing a scheme based on a two fluid type concept with super fluid and normal fluid densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 associated with velocities @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively.the zero frequency penetration depth is a measure of the distance scale on which a static magnetic field will penetrate into a superconductor . although the superconductor in the bulk has the property that it excludes all the magnetic flux , because of the superconducting screening current , it is in the surface layer that the field may still penetrate [ 19 ] .",

    "this implies that these materials can not satisfactorily be described by the conventional fermi liquid picture .",
    "varma et al [ 20,22 ] postulated that in the copper oxide system , there are charge and spin density fluctuations of the electronic system , which are significantly distinct from those in the conventional fermi liquid .",
    "these two excitations however have similar behaviour .",
    "these fluctuations lead to a new contribution to the polarisability of the electronic medium that would renormalize the electron through the self energy in accordance with the observed scattering rates .",
    "+ their proposal for this contribution to the polarisability is as follows : + @xmath37 + where n(0 ) is the single particle density of states at the fermi energy [ 1 ] .    kuroda and varma [ 3 ] calculated the specific heat of the marginal fermi liquid in the normal phase using a fermi liquid - like formula in the presence of electron - boson coupling constant .",
    "this boson is taken to be the itinerant particle - hole pair ( exciton ) itself in the normal state .",
    "they obtained the electronic specific heat @xmath38 of the marginal fermi liquid as    @xmath39    where @xmath34 is the characteristic temperature corresponding to the energy of the excitonic boson in the marginal fermi liquid theory and assuming coupling coefficient @xmath40=1 .",

    "if we extend our calculation to the bcs strong coupling regime , we hope to get a result closer to the experimental result .",
    "in this research , we have applied the results from the marginal fermi liquid theory to the @xmath98 gorter - casimir two fluid model and @xmath99 london theory and used these to calculate some thermodynamic properties like the specific heat jump and the temperature dependence of the critical magnetic field .",
    "we also calculated the electrodynamic property in particular magnetic field penetration depth .",
