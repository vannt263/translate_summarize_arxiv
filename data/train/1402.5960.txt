    "most psn models to date have been one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite . in the initial stages of a supernova , however , spherical symmetry can be broken by fluid instabilities that require multidimensional simulations .",
    "recent two - dimensional ( 2d ) models of pop iii psne by @xcite found that in most cases either no instabilities or only mild ones arose in the explosion .",
    "but their models proceeded from ` kepler ` profiles in which explosive burning was already complete . in reality",
    ", instabilities could be seeded at earlier times by core contraction and nuclear burning .",
    "they could alter the energetics and chemical yields of the explosion itself by mixing hot ash with fuel and enhancing burning .",
    "@xcite examined initial core contraction and bounce in psne in 2d but did not evolve the shock to breakout .",
    "@xcite modeled the psne of rotating stars with different masses in 2d .",
    "however , due to the rotation and metallicity effects , their study was limited to psne of blue supergiants . here",
    ", we consider the psne of non - rotating blue supergiants and red supergiants from 150 - 250 @xmath4  in 2d to investigate the formation of dynamical instabilities during the explosion and their impact on energetics and elemental yields .",
    "we describe our numerical methods and progenitor models in section 2 .",
    "the explosions , dynamical instabilities and internal mixing are examined in section 3 .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "self - consistent multidimensional stellar evolution models from the onset of hydrogen burning to eventual core contraction and explosion remain beyond the realm of contemporary computational power .",
    "we instead evolve psn progenitors in the 1d lagrangian code ` kepler ` @xcite up to the onset of explosive oxygen burning , just a few tens of seconds before maximum core compression . at this time , the central temperature of stars is about @xmath12 k and the explosive silicon burning , which produces most of @xmath10 and explosion energy , is about to occur .    we then port the ` kepler ` profile onto a 2d cylindrical coordinate grid in ` castro `   @xcite and evolve the star through core bounce , explosive burning , and shock breakout from the surface .",
    "this approach captures the most important features of the explosion and is computationally tractable .      in massive primordial stars , hydrogen burning proceeds by the carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ( cno ) cycle as in their metal - rich counterparts , except that carbon must first be formed by helium fusion via the triple alpha process .",
    "only very small metal mass fractions are required to initiate the cycle .",
    "typical cno mass fractions are @xmath13 for central h burning and @xmath14 for h shell burning .",
    "the cno cycle proceeds at a higher density and temperature , and overall lower entropy , than at higher metallicities . unlike metal - rich stars",
    ", primordial stars have a very small entropy barrier between the hydrogen shell and the helium core during helium burning . in massive stars , radiation dominates the pressure and facilitates convection .",
    "the central convection zone , which is rich in carbon and oxygen , can come close to the hydrogen - burning shell and even mix with it if there is sufficient convective overshoot or other convective boundary mixing @xcite .",
    "if mixing occurs , then carbon causes hydrogen to burn at a much higher rate that is proportional to the enrichment in cno , if temperatures and densities were fixed .",
    "depending on the degree of mixing , the higher burning rates can inflate the h envelope by about an order of magnitude in radius and turn the star into a red supergiant . if convective overshoot is weak , the star does not expand , and it evolves into a blue supergiant instead .",
    "the degree of mixing in any given star can not be predicted _ a priori _ and is usually a free parameter in 1d models @xcite .",
    "we adopt 150 , 200 , and 250 @xmath4  non - rotating progenitor models from @xcite for our simulation suite .",
    "they were evolved with either weak or strong convective mixing and therefore die as blue supergiants or red supergiants whose internal structures bracket those expected for very massive primordial stars .",
    "our models are designated as ` xyyy ` , where ` x ` indicates if the star is a red ( r ) or blue ( b ) supergiant and ` yyy ` is the mass of the star ( 150 , 200 , or 250 @xmath4 ) . as with the usual convention that massive pop iii stars do not lose mass over their lives @xcite , mass loss",
    "is turned off in our models .",

    "` castro ` is a massively parallel , multidimensional eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) radiation hydrodynamics code for astrophysical applications . `",
    "castro ` has an unsplit piecewise - parabolic method ( ppm ) hydro scheme @xcite and block - structured amr .",
    "we use the helmholtz equation of state @xcite , which includes contributions by both degenerate and non - degenerate relativistic and non - relativistic electrons , electron - positron pairs , ions and radiation .",
    "the monopole approximation is used for self - gravity , in which a spherically symmetric gravitational potential is constructed from the radial average of the density and then applied to gravitational force updates everywhere in the amr hierarchy @xcite . even with dynamical instabilities , this is a reasonable approximation to the matter distribution of the star and is very efficient .",
    "our models include multispecies advection for the 19 elements listed below .",
    "we implemented the 19-isotope approx reaction network in ` castro ` to follow nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "this is the same network used in our ` kepler ` models , and it evolves mass fractions for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath10 , protons ( due to photo - disintegrations ) , and neutrons .",
    "it includes alpha - chain reactions , a heavy - ion reaction network , hydrogen burning cycles , photo - disintegration of heavy nuclei , and energy loss due to thermal neutrinos .",
    "nuclear burning is self - consistently evolved with hydrodynamics . since explosive burning of @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and @xmath23 is what primarily drives the energetics and yields in our psn models , this network is sufficient for capturing the energy of the explosion and the synthesis of key isotopes .",
    "the most powerful of our explosions produces up to @xmath31 of @xmath10 .",
    "our network also includes energy release from radioactive decay of @xmath10 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath32 @xmath34 .    to test the approx network in ` castro ` , we ran the b200 psn in ` kepler ` and ` castro ` in 1d for about 100 seconds .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : kc ] , temperatures , densities and @xmath10 yields for the two runs are in good agreement , with a deviation in final explosion energy of less than 1% .      differences between codes in dimensionality and coordinate mesh can lead to numerical artifacts such as violation of conservation of mass , energy , and momentum when mapping a blast profile from one code to another .",
    "the simplest approach is to initialize fluid variables at a given point on a 2d grid by linearly interpolating between those on the 1d grid that bracket it in radius .",
    "but this practice can fail to resolve critical length scales in the original stellar model , such as those associated with nuclear burning .",
    "this is especially true when porting profiles from 1d lagrangian codes , which can resolve very small features with a just a few zones in mass , to eulerian grids that may require far more mesh points to resolve the same features in space .",
    "even minor violations in conservation can lead to serious errors in simulations because some processes , like nuclear burning , are very sensitive to temperature .",
    "slight errors in the mapping process can therefore lead to very different outcomes in a run .",
    "we therefore use a new procedure to map our 1d psn profiles from ` kepler ` onto 2d grids in ` castro ` that preserves the conservation of fluid variables at any resolution @xcite .",
    "the grid is then seeded with turbulent perturbations from a kolmogorov spectrum @xcite rather than the simple random perturbations used in earlier work to approximate the convective velocities that would be present in a star .",
    "our ` castro ` root grid is a 2d cylindrical coordinate mesh with 256 zones in both @xmath35 and @xmath36 . up to 3 levels of amr refinement",
    "are allowed , each of which is a factor of 4 greater in resolution , for a maximum resolution 64 times that of the coarse grid .",
    "the grid is refined on gradients in density , velocity , and pressure . because we simulate only one quadrant domain of the star , reflecting and outflow boundary conditions are used on the lower and upper boundaries of the grid , respectively , in both @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "simulations with nuclear burning are very different from purely hydrodynamical ones because much higher spatial and temporal resolution is required to resolve the scales on which burning occurs . since nuclear burning is very sensitive to temperature , errors in energy release and nucleosynthesis rates can easily arise in regions that are not fully resolved .",
    "we performed a series of runs in 1d in ` castro ` to determine the resolution required to resolve burning in our 2d models . in each 1d run",
    "we evolved the star from initial core contraction until the end of all explosive burning , and then computed the total energy of the sn by summing the gravitational , internal , and kinetic energies .",
    "the total energy converged at a grid resolution of @xmath37 , but because the required resolution may vary slightly in different models we adopted a more conservative resolution of @xmath38 for our 2d ` castro ` runs .    in principle",
    ", it would be possible to accommodate the entire star on the grid , whose radius can be up to a few times 10@xmath39 cm , and still resolve explosive burning .",
    "but 6 levels of amr refinement would be required to achieve the required dynamical range of 10@xmath40 instead of 3 , and the manner in which time steps between adjacent levels are sub - cycled in ` castro ` causes the simulation to run much more slowly if more than 5 levels are used . as a result , even a 2d simulation of the entire star would require 500,000 cpu hours . instead of modeling the entire star at once ,",
    "the initial coarse grid encloses just the core of the star with enough zones to resolve explosive burning . when the sn shock reaches the boundary of the grid we halt the simulation , resample the blast profile onto a larger mesh , and then restart the run .",
    "we map the original profile of the star from the radius of the shock to the new outer boundary onto the grid prior to relaunching the run .",
    "we repeat this procedure until the entire star resides on the grid . in each regrid",
    ", we retain the same total number of grids , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : expand ] .",
    "we want to simulate a domain about 10 times larger than the size of star which requires 8 levels amr . by using the homographic expansion",
    ", we can break one simulation of 8 levels amr into five simulations of 3 levels amr .",
    "this increases the stability of simulations and saves @xmath41 of cpu time .",
    "the travel time of the shock through the star is at most a few days , much less than the timescales on which the star itself evolves ( a few thousand years ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the envelope of the star does not change in the time it takes for the shock to break out of the star .",
    "this can also be seen from the free - fall time of the envelope , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the gravitational constant and @xmath44 is the density .",
    "if we take the density of the envelope to be @xmath45 , we find that @xmath46 is a few hundred years , which is much longer than the time it takes the shock to cross the star . furthermore , although the spatial resolution decreases after each expansion of the grid , it does not affect the simulation at later times because burning is finished before the first expansion and the dynamical instabilities are well resolved by later grids .",
    "minor sound waves can appear at the boundaries as numerical artifacts of the regrid process .",
    "but the shock has a much higher mach number , @xmath47 , and reaches the outer boundaries before the acoustic waves can affect either explosive burning or the formation of instabilities .",
    "periodically enlarging the grid throughout the run with fewer levels of refinement allows us to evolve the psn in much shorter simulation times while maintaining full fidelity to the solution .",
    "at the onset of core contraction in ` castro ` , energy loss by emission of neutrinos from pair production exceeds energy production by nuclear burning .",
    "a few seconds later , the core reaches a temperature @xmath48 4 @xmath49 10@xmath5 k , which ignites silicon burning .",
    "central silicon burning and oxygen and carbon shell burning proceed out of hydrodynamical equilibrium .",
    "explosive burning lasts 10 - 20 seconds but releases enough energy to reverse the ram pressure of core contraction and drive a shock that completely disperses the star . in figure",
    "[ fig : ivel ] we show spherically averaged 1d velocities from the beginning of core contraction to bounce .",
    "the outer layers of the core begin to contraction at 2 - 5 @xmath49 10@xmath50 cm sec@xmath51 and then accelerate in a free fall to several 10@xmath5 cm sec@xmath51 prior to reversal by explosive burning . in the r250 run , infall simply continues , accelerating to @xmath1 2 @xmath49 10@xmath5 cm sec@xmath51 , or nearly @xmath52 of the speed of light . in this model ,",
    "most of the energy from burning goes to photo - disintegration of heavy nuclei rather than a shock , and the star likely collapses to a black hole . in ` kepler ` simulations , this star develops a large helium core , @xmath1 @xmath53 and eventually dies as a black hole @xcite .",

    "burning in the @xmath23  core does not trigger visible instabilities in any of the models .",
    "they may not appear because the density and temperature profiles for @xmath58 cm , where @xmath10  is created , are nearly flat , and this plus the absence of any interface or discontinuities may suppress their formation .    nuclear burning ( of mostly helium ) by the shock at the interface between the oxygen / carbon and helium shells enhances the entropy gradient across them and triggers the formation of instabilities there , as seen in the outer contours in the b150 and b200 runs .",

    "we show an enlarged view of these features in figure  [ fig : i2dzoom ] .",

    "if the gas pressure , @xmath59 , and the density , @xmath44 , satisfy the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) criterion for a fluid @xcite @xmath60 then instabilities will form .",

    "the shock velocity can then be obtained from dimensional analysis : @xmath65    the evolution of the shock velocity depends on @xmath66 . if @xmath67 , the shock velocity is independent of time . if @xmath68 , the hot gas at high pressure behind the shock accelerates the shock . if @xmath69 , the material swept up by the shock decelerates the shock .",
    "this deceleration is communicated to the fluid behind by the shock at the sound speed , and it sets up a pressure gradient in the direction that the material was decelerated .",

    "the two peaks in each star are its helium core and hydrogen envelope , respectively . because the red supergiants have more extended hydrogen envelopes than the blue supergiants , they have much higher second peaks that favor the formation of reverse shocks and the development of rt instabilities .",
    "the instabilities due to the reverse shock grow until the forward shock breaks out of the star .",

    ", instabilities seeded during core contraction and explosive burning in principle can alter the yield of the sn by mixing hot ash with fuel and accelerating burning , unlike instabilities that develop in the reverse shock at later times after the end of burning .",
    "although instabilities do appear at these early stages , they do not affect nucleosynthesis or energy generation for two reasons .",
    "first , most of the explosive silicon burning occurs at the very center of the star , not at the base of the oxygen - burning shell where the instabilities form , so there is no evidence of mixing of hot ash in the core .",
    "second , burning time scales are so short compared to dynamical times that instabilities do not have time to become large enough to dredge material up from the core and drive mixing .    later , when the sn shock reaches the helium layer , it burns @xmath17 into @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the energy released creates pressure gradients opposite to the gradients in density and mass fractions , causing the formation of rt instabilities that also , in principle , could accelerate helium burning .",
    "but these instabilities do not survive for long because temperatures behind the shock rapidly fall as the star expands .",
    "about 100 seconds after core bounce , the postshock gas has cooled to @xmath75 , and nuclear burning becomes too weak to drive further instability growth .",
    "they then become frozen in mass coordinate until the reverse shock forms .",
    "although they may briefly enhance helium burning , it does not affect the speed of the shock or its energy .",
    "instabilities are too weak to dredge @xmath10  up from the core at early times in psne in either red or blue supergiants .",
    "later , when instabilities with much larger amplitudes form in red supergiants because of the reverse shock , they still do not transport much @xmath10  up from lower depths and most of the energy from its decay is deposited locally in the ejecta .",
    "our simulations therefore suggest that internal mixing in these events will probably not be visible in their observational signatures , in either the order that lines from metals appear in the spectra over time or the appearance of gamma rays from @xmath10  decay .",
    "the conclusions about the detectability of psne at high @xmath36 derived from prior 1d radiation hydrodynamics calculations therefore still hold .",
    "we note that if these explosions occur at high redshift , neither x - rays and hard uv from shock breakout nor the leakage of gamma rays from @xmath10  at later times would be detected because of absorption by the neutral intergalactic medium and the outer layers of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we find that instability growth in pop iii psne is generally much weaker than in 15 - 40 @xmath4  type ii sne , which exhibit rampant mixing @xcite .",
