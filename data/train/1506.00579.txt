    "in recent years , high - resolution spectroscopic analyses of samples of stars with metallicities significantly below solar have grown to the point that one can begin to establish the general behaviors of elemental abundance ratios associated with production by the first few generations of stars to form the galaxy ( for a recent review see , e.g. , frebel & norris 2015 ) .",
    "these `` statistical '' samples are particularly valuable when the data are analysed in a self - consistent manner ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that comparisons of derived abundance ratios are not plagued by the scatter introduced from the different assumptions and procedures used by individual researchers , which can be sufficiently large as to obscure important details .    of particular interest to this effort is the class of stars that , despite their overall low abundances of iron - peak elements , exhibit large over - abundances of c ( as well as n and o ) in their atmospheres , the so - called carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars @xcite .",
    "this class comprises a number of sub - classes ( originally defined by beers & christlieb 2005 ) , based on the behavior of their neutron - capture elements : ( 1 ) cemp-@xmath2 stars , which exhibit no over - abundances of n - capture elements , ( 2 ) cemp-@xmath3 stars , which show n - capture over - abundances consistent with the slow neutron - capture process , ( 3 ) cemp-@xmath4 stars , with n - capture over - abundances associated with the rapid neutron - capture process , and ( 4 ) cemp-@xmath5 stars , which exhibit n - capture over - abundances that suggest contribution from both the slow and rapid neutron - capture processes .",
    "each of these sub - classes appear to be associated with different element - production histories , thus their study provides insight into the variety of astrophysical sites in the early galaxy that were primarily responsible for their origin .",
    "the cemp-@xmath2 stars are of special importance , as the preponderance of evidence points to their being associated with elemental - abundance patterns that were produced by the very first generation of massive stars @xcite , thus they potentially provide a unique probe of the first mass function in the early universe along with providing information on the nucleosynthesis and properties of the first stars .    in a previous paper , @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) provided a detailed study of the elemental abundances for a sample of four ultra metal - poor stars with @xmath0 } < -4.0 $ ] , three of which are clear examples of cemp-@xmath2 stars . here",
    "we supplement this sample with an additional 19 stars , exploring a wider range of metallicity .",
    "this allows for the inclusion of additional examples of cemp-@xmath2 , cemp-@xmath3 , cemp-@xmath4 , and cemp-@xmath5 stars ( two of which qualify as possible nitrogen - enhanced metal - poor ( nemp ) stars ) , providing a more complete picture of the variety of elemental - abundance patterns for stars of very low metallicity .    this paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes our observations and data analysis techniques .",
    "section 3 presents our abundance analysis results , while section 4 provides a summary and brief discussion of their implications .",
    "our sample of 23 very metal - poor ( vmp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) , extremely metal - poor ( emp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath9 ) , ultra metal - poor ( ump ; [ fe / h ] @xmath10 ) stars presented here were originally selected from the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , followed up with medium - resolution spectroscopy on a variety of 2-m to 4-m class telescopes ( aat  3.9 m , ctio  4 m , ctio  1.5 m , eso  3.6 m , kpno  4 m , soar  4 m , sso  2.3 m , and ukst  1.2 m ) , and then observed at high spectral resolution with vlt / uves @xcite .",
    "paper  i describes the observations and analysis of the four ump stars in this sample .",
    "the high - resolution spectroscopy of the stars in our sample was performed with uves using the dichroic ( dic ) beam splitter , allowing simultaneous observation with the blue and red arm , in order to cover a spectral range including a large number of chemical elements .",
    "three different settings were used : dic ( blue central wavelength + red central wavelength ) , covering the following wavelengths ",

    "the spectral resolving power varies with the choice of wavelength setting and slit width . the average resolving power of the spectra is r @xmath12 45,000 .",
    "positions , observation dates , exposure times , and specific settings for the individual stars in the sample are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the uves reduction pipeline version 4.9.8 .",
    "radial - velocity shifts of the spectra were obtained using the iraf task fxcor .",
    "individual spectra were cross - correlated with a template spectrum obtained during the same observation run .",
    "for the 2005 run , he  0134@xmath131519 and hd  2796 were used as templates , for which we find @xmath14 = 244.0 km  s@xmath15 and @xmath16 km  s@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "for the 2006 run , hd  140283 was used , for which we find @xmath17 km  s@xmath15 . for stars with multiple observations ,",
    "the individual spectra were co - added with the iraf scombine task .",
    "finally the radial - velocity shifted ( and combined ) spectrum was normalized .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] lists the derived radial velocities and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios at specific wavelengths for the different spectra . when a wavelength region is covered by more than one setting , the one having the highest s / n ratio is listed .",
    "note that , because the spectra were only obtained spanning at most a few nights , these data are not suitable for evaluation of the binary nature of our stars .",
    "however , the high accuracy of our derived radial velocities ( typically better than 1 km  s@xmath15 ) should prove useful for comparison with future binarity studies .",
