    "understanding the extraordinary viscous slowing down that characterizes the glass formation is a major scientific challenge @xcite . from a microscopic point of view , when a liquid approaches the glass transition , the particles are subjected to prolonged trapping by their surroundings and the structural relaxation time @xmath1 , i.e the average escape time from the cage of the first neighbors , increases from a few picoseconds up to thousands of seconds . during the trapping period",
    "the rattling motion inside the cage occurs on picosecond time scales with mean square amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "henceforth @xmath3 will be referred to as `` fast mobility '' .",
    "the temporary trapping and subsequent escape mechanisms lead to large fluctuations around the averaged dynamical behavior with strong heterogeneous dynamics @xcite and non - exponential relaxation @xcite .",
    "pioneering @xcite investigations and recent theoretical @xcite studies addressed the rattling process in the cage to understand the structural relaxation - the escape process - gaining support from numerical @xcite and experimental works on glassforming liquids @xcite .",
    "renewed interest about the fast mobility was raised by extensive molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations evidencing the universal correlation between the structural relaxation time @xmath1 and @xmath4 were reported in polymeric systems @xcite , binary atomic mixtures @xcite , colloidal gels @xcite and antiplasticized polymers @xcite and compared with the experimental data concerning several glassformers in a wide fragility range ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "one major finding was that statesof a given physical system , say x and y , with equal fast mobility @xmath4 have equal relaxation times @xmath1 too : @xmath6 the generalisation of eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] to deal with states of different physical systems is discussed elsewhere @xcite and exemplified in sec.[dynamic ] .",
    "after proper account of the molecular - weight dependence eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] extends to longer time scales in polymers where states with equal fast mobility exhibit also equal chain reorientation rate @xcite and diffusivity @xcite .",
    "correlation between diffusion and fast mobility was observed in atomic mixtures too @xcite .",
    "a more general relation leading to eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] is provided by the particle displacement distribution , i.e. the incoherent , or self part , of the van hove function @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath7 is direct .",
    "the product @xmath8 is the probability that the particle is at a distance between @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the initial position after a time @xmath11 . in terms of @xmath12",
    "the relation between fast and slow dynamics is expressed by stating that , if two statesof a given physical system are characterized by the _",
    "same _ displacement distribution @xmath13 at the trapping time @xmath14 , they also exhibit the _ same _ distribution at long times , e.g. at @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath15 the precise definition of the trapping time @xmath14(not to be confused with the peak position of the non - gaussian parameter ) will be given in sec.[dynamic ] where it will be also shown that eq.[vanhovescaling ] implies eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] .",
    "actually , the coincidence of the two incoherent van hove functions extends across all the time interval between @xmath14 and at least @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "eq.[vanhovescaling ] holds even in the presence of very strong dynamical heterogeneity where both diffusive and jump - like dynamics are observed @xcite . from this respect ,",
    "it offers an interpretation of the scaling of the breakdown of the stokes - einstein law in terms of the fast mobility @xcite and is consistent with previous conclusions that the long - time dynamical heterogeneity is predicted by the fast heterogeneities @xcite .",
    "several approaches suggest that structural aspects matter in the dynamical behavior of glassforming systems .",
    "this includes the adam - gibbs derivation of the structural relaxation @xcite - built on the thermodynamic notion of the configurational entropy @xcite - , the mode- coupling theory @xcite and extensions @xcite , the random first - order transition theory @xcite , the frustration - based approach @xcite , as well as the so - called elastic models @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that the proper inclusion of many - body static correlations in theories of the glass transition appears crucial for the description of the dynamics of fragile glass formers @xcite .",
    "the search of a link between structural ordering and slow dynamics motivated several studies in liquids @xcite , colloids @xcite and polymeric systems @xcite .",
    "we also note that the elastic models of the glass transition conclude that the relaxation is related to the elastic shear modulus , a quantity which is set by the arrangement of the particles in mechanical equilibrium and their mutual interactions @xcite .",
    "the present work is carried out in the spirit of the cell theory of the liquid state @xcite .",
    "each cell is identified by the voronoi polyhedron ( vp ) which , as originally suggested by rahman @xcite and later studies @xcite , provide useful information about the local molecular environment , e.g. to get to the equation of state of the hard sphere liquid @xcite . for a given configuration , the vp surrounding a particle encloses all the points which are closer to it than to any other one . following a preliminary report @xcite",
    ", we investigate by thorough molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations the particle fast mobility and relaxation of linear molecules and binary atomic mixtures .",
    "the purpose is the assessment of the correlations of the fast mobility @xmath3 with the size and the shape of the cage formed by the nearest neighbors of the trapped particle .",
    "the local geometry is characterized by the volume and the asphericity of the associated vp .",
    "alternatives are reported @xcite .",
    "asphericity has been considered in polymers @xcite , water @xcite , silica @xcite , small molecules @xcite , packed beds of particles @xcite , hard @xcite and soft @xcite spheres and its better ability to discriminate different local structures with respect to other features of the voronoi polyhedron has been noted @xcite .",
    "the motivation for searching for a connection between cage geometry and fast mobility is that it is intuitively expected .",
    "nonetheless , we find that the correlations are rather weak on a per - particle basis .",
    "more insight is provided by grouping the ensemble of particles in ( nearly ) iso - volume , iso - asphericity and iso - mobility subsets which reveals the increase of the fast mobility in cages with increasing size and asphericity .",
    "however , the correlations are weak and differ in states with equal relaxation time , thus preventing the microscopic interpretation of eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] , eq.[vanhovescaling ] in terms of the cage geometry alone .",
    "it is found that the local forces between a tagged particle and the first - neighbour shell do not correlate with the fast mobility in the molecular liquid .",
    "we offer arguments suggesting that the single - particle fast mobility is affected by regions extending beyond the nearest neighbours in agreement with other studies @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[numerical ]",
    "the md algorithms are outlined , and the atomic and the molecular models are detailed . the results are presented and discussed in sec.[resultsdiscussion ] . in particular , in sec.[dynamic ] the fast rattling motion and the long - time relaxation are characterised , whereas sec.[correlations ] expounds for the first time on the search of cross correlations between the cage geometry and the fast dynamics .",

    "fig.[u2-asfericita ] plots the _ initial _ average asphericity of the cage versus the _ subsequent _ average fast mobility of the two classes of subsets .",
    "it is seen that the mobility increases with the cage asphericity .",
    "there is no clear signature of this intuitive result in fig.[contorplot_a ] .",
    "this is due to the weak correlations which manifest in fig.[u2-asfericita ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath184 is weakly dependent on @xmath158 ( fig.[u2-asfericita ] , main panels ) , and @xmath162 is weakly dependent on @xmath161 ( fig.[u2-asfericita ] , inserts ) .",
    "the subset analysis is now applied to the cage size .",
    "fig.[u2-volume ] summarizes the results concerning the volume and the fast - mobility subsets as a plot of the _ initial _ average volume of the cage versus the _ subsequent _ average fast mobility .",
    "it is seen that the mobility increases with the cage size in both kind of subsets .",
    "similarly to the asphericity , there is no clear signature of this second intuitive result in fig.[contorplot_v ] due to the weak correlations .",
    "the weak increase of the mobility with the vp volume has been also noted in colloids and polymers by considering the displacements of 10 % fastest and 10 % slowest particles @xcite .",
    "all in all , fig.[u2-volume ] confirms that the vp volume is of modest interest @xcite .",
    "one disappointing conclusion drawn by both fig.[u2-asfericita ] and fig.[u2-volume ] is that the increase of the mobility with either the cage size or asphericity is _",
    "state dependent_. in particular , the increase is different even if the states have equal relaxation time .",
    "such states have identical distribution of the fast mobility , eq.[pu2 ] .",
    "then , if x and y are two iso - relaxation states , one has from eq.[u2s ] : @xmath185 eq.[u2z ] states that , if the states have equal relaxation time , the fast - mobility subsets have _ equal _ average value of the fast mobility .",
    "nonetheless , the inserts of fig.[u2-asfericita ] and fig.[u2-volume ] show that the _ initial _ average size and shape of the cages embedding these particles are _",
    "different_.    as a final remark , we remind that both the fast mobility @xmath3 and the structural relaxation time have relation with the voids between particles , as measured by the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the pals lifetime , which is related to the average size of the cavity where the annihilation takes place @xcite .",
    "our findings about the poor correlation between the fast mobility and the cage size are seemingly at variance with this experimental results .",
    "however , it must be noted that pals is sensitive to the _ unoccupied volume _ which is more closely represented by the volume of the tetrahedra following the delaunay tessellation @xcite .",
    "our study is concerned with the voronoi tessellation .",
    "the difference between the two tessellations is that the delaunay tetrahedron describes the shape of the cavity between the particles whereas the voronoi polyhedron describes the coordination of the nearest - particles .",
    "the investigation of the possible correlation between the fast mobility and the size/ shape of the delaunay tetrahedra is beyond the purpose of the present paper .",
    "ultimately , the mobility of a tagged particle is set , in addition to kinetic aspects , by the total force @xmath188 exerted by the surroundings which , in turn , depends on the geometry of the particles arrangement _ and _ the interaction potential .",
    "our present results point to the conclusion that the _ local _ geometry correlates poorly with the fast mobility . in order to understand",
    "if , in spite of the minor role of the cage geometry , states with identical fast mobility exhibit common aspects of the total force acting on a particle , we investigated the distribution of the modulus @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the mean square force ( msf ) @xmath190 which includes both binary and triplet force contributions @xcite .",
    "msf is related to the second frequency moment of the velocity correlation function @xmath191 : @xmath192 @xmath193 being the particle mass @xcite .",
    "@xmath194 is largely contributed by local forces , i.e. the ones between the tagged particle and the first - neighbour shell , @xcite and represents the frequency at which the tagged particle would vibrate if it were undergoing small oscillations in the potential well produced by the surrounding particles when kept fixed at their mean equilibrium positions around the tagged particle @xcite .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath195 is a measure of the local stiffness .",
    "[ forcedistribut ] shows that states of the molecular liquid with equal fast mobility have quite different distributions of the total force .",
    "they also exhibit different local stiffness ( fig .",
    "[ forcedistribut ] , inset ) .",
    "note also that states with rather different relaxation times have rather similar local stiffness .",
    "even if other states , in particular much closer to the glass transition , should be investigated to provide wider evidence , we preliminarily conclude that the fast mobility in a mildly - supercooled _ molecular _ liquid is not driven by the force exerted by the closest neighbours . notice that iso - mobility and iso - relaxation time states of an _ atomic _ liquid , with equal density and temperature , exhibit identical local force distributions @xmath189 , and then equal msf @xcite .",
    "this different behaviour needs further investigation .     with equal fast mobility .",
    "the inset shows the poor correlation between the fast mobility of the same states with the local stiffness.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      the present study reaches three major conclusions :    * there are weak correlations between fast mobility , i.e. the rattling of the particle trapped by the cage of the neighbours , and the cage geometry itself . *",
    "the cage geometry is unable to provide a microscopic interpretation of the correlation between the cage rattling and the slow structural relaxation as expressed by eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] , eq.[vanhovescaling ] .",
    "in fact , it is found that two iso - relaxation states have quite clear correlations between their fast dynamics , but no obvious relations between their cage geometries .",
    "* local forces between a tagged particle and the first - neighbour shell do not correlate with the fast mobility in mildly supercooled states of the molecular liquid .",
    "why these failures ? our results must not lead to the conclusion that no correlation between the structure and the dynamics exists , in that the coupling between the dynamic and the structure is reported in the atomic mixture @xcite and the molecular liquid @xcite under study , also due to the harsh short - ranged repulsive character of the potentials .",
    "instead , we notice that the vp volume and asphericity are mainly controlled by the closest neighbours of the particle and then poorly sensitive to the liquid structure beyond the first shell",
    ". this aspect matters .",
    "the influence of structure on dynamics is much stronger on long length scales than on short ones in the atomic mixture @xcite .    furthermore , there are evidences in the molecular liquid studied here that the fast motion follows from the collective motion of regions extending more than the first coordination shell , a finding which is consistent with elastic models @xcite .",
    "one piece of evidence comes from the identical fast mobility of _ separate _ parts of the molecule , i.e. the end and the central monomers of the molecule , irrespective of the different asphericity and size of their cages , see fig.[contorplot_a ] and fig.[contorplot_v ] of the present paper , as well as fig.6 of ref.@xcite where the same result is found in much longer chain molecules .",
    "furthermore , it has been evidenced that a given monomer and the surrounding particles up to the next - next - nearest neighbours undergo _ simultaneous , correlated _ , rapid displacements within the trapping time @xmath14 over which the fast mobility is evaluated ( see eq.[st - msd ] ) @xcite",
    ". one appealing feature of the correlations between the fast displacements is that both their _ strength _ and _ spatial extension _ are _ identical _ in states with _ equal _ relaxation time and increase with the latter , thus suggesting non - local interpretations of the link between the cage rattling and the slow structural relaxation ( eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] , eq.[vanhovescaling ] ) @xcite .",
    "the non - local view is in harmony with the finding that the structural relaxation does not correlate with the infinite - frequency elastic response , which is _ local _ in nature , but with the _ quasi - static _ elastic response at zero wavevector ( k=0 ) which occurs under _ mechanically equilibrium _ ( @xmath196 ) @xcite .",
    "this has important implications .",
    "in fact , the deformation field at low frequency is quite extended and , indeed , is scale - free in simple examples , e.g. it decays as @xmath197 with @xmath198 for a localised force and @xmath199 for cavity expansion .",
    "the suggested presence of non - local fast collective motion agrees with the evidence of quasi - local soft modes , i.e. with an extended component , in md simulations of 2d binary mixtures and the finding that the regions of motion of the quasi - local soft modes exhibit striking correlation with the regions of high debye - waller factor @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed that structural relaxation in deeply supercooled liquids proceeds via the accumulation of eshelby events , i.e. local rearrangements that create long - ranged and anisotropic stresses in the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "the present md study aims at clarifying the role of the cage geometry in affecting the fast mobility @xmath3 , namely the rattling amplitude of the particles temporarily trapped by the cage of the neighbors , in mildly supercooled states .",
    "the fast mobility is a very accurate predictor of the long - time relaxation , as summarized by eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] , stating that two states with equal fast mobility have equal relaxation time as well @xcite , and the more general eq.[vanhovescaling ] linking the single - particle fast dynamics and slow relaxation @xcite .",
    "the cage geometry has been characterised by the volume @xmath141 and the asphericity @xmath142 of the voronoi polyhedra following the tessellation of the configurations of both a molecular and an atomic liquid . a novel cross - correlation analysis between the fast mobility and the voronoi volume and",
    "shape has been performed .",
    "signatures of connection between the fast mobility and the cage geometry are not found in either the joint ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) or the marginal ( @xmath165 and @xmath167 ) distributions .",
    "weak correlations are identified by partitioning the voronoi cells in asphericity and size subsets , as well as by dividing the particles in fast - mobility subsets .",
    "the procedure reveals the increase of the average fast - mobility with the average size and asphericity of the different subsets .",
    "the observed correlations are not the same in states with equal relaxation time , leading us to the conclusion that the cage geometry is unable to provide a microscopic interpretation of the link between the cage rattling and the slow structural relaxation , as expressed by eq.[vanhovescaling2 ] , eq.[vanhovescaling ] .",
    "local forces between a tagged particle and the first - neighbour shell do not correlate with the fast mobility in the molecular liquid .",
    "we suggest that the single - particle fast mobility follows by modes extending beyond the first neighbours ."
