    "this estimate of the diffusion of x - ray line photons in m87 has been motivated by the exceptionally low abundances of iron , silicon and oxygen within @xmath0 kpc of the center of m87 as recently observed by bhringer et al ( 2000 ) with xmm - newton .",
    "we explore the possibility that these abundance variations are artifacts of the outward diffusion of optically thick x - ray lines as suggested by gilfranov et al .",

    "we find that the expected outward migration of line photons does occur , but is insufficient to account for the central photon depletion observed . instead , an additional source of continuous absorption is indicated , as suggested by buote ( 2000 ) , and we speculate about its physical nature . before discussing our results , we begin with a review of the properties of the m87 cooling flow and describe our line transfer calculation .",
    "the electron density distribution in the m87 cooling flow is taken from nulsen and bhringer ( 1995 ) , corrected to distance 17 mpc ( 1 = 4.945 kpc ) : @xmath2^{-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 kpc is the effective radius . according to bhringer et al .",

    "this inner density distribution is based on rosat hri observations reported in bhringer ( 1999 ) . since the central x - ray emission in m87",
    "is known to be partly non - thermal ( and time variable ) , this latter density determination may be uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , in the following we assume that @xmath13 is given by the maximum of @xmath14 and @xmath15 which intersect at 11.9 kpc .",
    "the ( single - phase ) gas temperature distribution is found by combining the results of bhringer et al .",

    "this temperature profile rises from the center toward a broad maximum , similar to thermal profiles in other well - observed bright elliptical galaxy cooling flows ( brighenti & mathews 1997 ) .",
    "the location of the temperature maximum in m87 is at an unusually large radius presumably due to the relatively high ambient temperature ( 2 - 3 kev ) in the virgo cluster .",
    "the central cooling of the gas can be understood as the mixing of hot inflowing gas from the virgo cluster with gas lost from evolving stars in m87 which orbit with a lower virial temperature than that of the surrounding cluster ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ) .",
    "the characteristic deep central temperature minimum in m87 indicates that most of the gas in m87 has not been substantially heated by the jet and radio source .",
    "we assume meteoritic solar abundances with @xmath22 and @xmath23 for o and si respectively .",
    "the radial abundance variation of each element in the hot gas relative to solar meteoritic is represented with @xmath24 .",
    "the line emissivity is assumed to vary with local temperature according to the emission coefficients @xmath25 determined by landini & monsignori fossi ( l - mf ; 1990 ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a factor of order unity that corrects l - mf abundances to solar meteoritic and @xmath28 is the local proton density in a plasma with molecular weight @xmath29 .",
    "the emission lines that we consider arise from the ground state and are doppler broadened by thermal and turbulent velocities .",
    "the absorption coefficient is @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the local abundance of the line - emitting element and @xmath32 is the fractional abundance of the line - emitting ion interpolated from the results of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) for collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "photons are assumed to be emitted in a gaussian profile centered on the line energy @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the dimensionless line frequency with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the atomic weight of element e. the line center optical depth in the radial direction is found by integrating @xmath37 .",
    "we are taking @xmath38 and @xmath39 from two different sources .",
    "however , the error from this possible inconsistency is unlikely to be large since collisional ionization fractions @xmath38 found by most authors , including l - mf , are in good agreement with those of arnaud & rothenflug ( 1985 ) .",
    "to estimate the diffusion of x - ray line photons , we represent the inner cooling flow of m87 with @xmath40 radial zones , each having different but individually uniform temperature and density .",
    "the zone spacing @xmath41 is chosen so that the line luminosity is the same from each zone .",
    "the monte carlo process begins by choosing the zone of origin of each photon based on equal weighting among the zones .",

    "if the photon continues to move through several zones without scattering , @xmath59 and @xmath48 remain constant and equation ( 5 ) can be used to find the total path length moved @xmath60 .",
    "the distance @xmath61 traversed by the photon across each zone must be compared to the free path in the zone : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the absorption coefficient of the photon in zone @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath65 varies from zone to zone it is necessary to rescale the frequency to the local zone @xmath64 ( @xmath66 ) : @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath68 , the photon moves into the next zone , but if @xmath69 the photon is scattered at radius @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the photon is then scattered into a new random direction beginning a new trajectory with @xmath72 , assuming complete redistribution in the gaussian line profile .",
    "the scattering is conservative so all photons must ultimately flow out beyond the outermost zone . when the photon reaches the outer boundary of the gas @xmath73 , where the optical depths are very small , it is assumed to escape freely .",
    "we describe transfer calculations for two lines : sixiv 2.003 kev ( l@xmath27 ) and oviii 0.652 kev ( l@xmath27 ) , both having f - values @xmath74",
    ". since these resonance lines are among the most optically thick lines of si and o at m87 gas temperatures , the apparent abundance distribution inferred from each of these lines  subsequent to spatial diffusion  must correspond to the largest possible central abundance depletion . for each line - emitting element",
    "the apparent radial abundance profiles observed with xmm - newton can be fit with @xmath75^{-1}.\\ ] ] the apparent ( meteoritic ) abundance dependence of si and o are approximated with : ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) = ( 0.1 , 7.4 , 0.34 , 0.7 ) and ( 0.05 , 8.0 , 0.5 , 0.94 ) respectively ; @xmath77 and @xmath78 are in kpc .",
    "the line center optical depths in the three lines evaluated with @xmath80 ( fig . 1 ) are smaller than those suggested by bhringer et al ( 2000 ) in part because we use the higher temperatures observed instead of their isothermal approximation . if the observed abundance maxima are due to outward photon diffusion by conservative scattering before escape , the total x - ray line luminosity within some larger radius ( where @xmath81 ) is unaffected by the radiative transfer .",
    "according to this line diffusion hypothesis , the true radial abundance profiles are expected to decrease monotonically as we represent with @xmath82 the first term accounts for the local enrichment by stellar mass loss and snia explosions , and the second term represents the abundance of cluster cooling flow gas flowing into m87 , but the parameterized fit is not intended to exactly quantify these two enrichment sources .",
    "the coefficients in equation ( 7 ) are chosen so that the total line luminosities within 50 kpc are very close to luminosities based on @xmath83 ( see below ) : ( @xmath84 , @xmath85(kpc ) , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) = ( 1.0 , 35 , 1.4 , 0.15 ) and ( 0.4 , 12 , 2 , 0.14 ) for si and o respectively .",
    "the @xmath87 are chosen for agreement with the xmm - newton abundances at @xmath88 kpc ; @xmath85 is assumed to be similar to @xmath7 kpc appropriate for a stellar contribution ; @xmath86 is chosen for a reasonable fit to the xmm - newton data in @xmath89 kpc ; @xmath84 is adjusted until the total luminosity within @xmath90 kpc ( where all lines are optically thin ) matches that of each line computed with @xmath80 . with these assumed intrinsic abundance profiles",
    "@xmath24 , the total line luminosities within 50 kpc exceed the approximate observed luminosities of the si and o lines by about 2 and 13 percent respectively .",
    "we exceed the oxygen line luminosity based on @xmath91 since this abundance is less accurately determined by the xmm - newton data .",
    "the cumulative line center optical depths are somewhat greater when evaluated with @xmath24 than with @xmath80 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "monte carlo radiative transfer for each line has been calculated with @xmath92 photons , 50 spatial zones and abundances @xmath24 .",
    "results are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the light dotted histograms show the abundance of each element that would be inferred by observing each line in the optically thin limit , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the number of photons created in each zone and @xmath95 is the mean number of photons per zone .",
    "the adjacent light - line histograms show the variation of the apparent abundance indicated by each line after radiative diffusion , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the number of photons that escape from each zone with no further scattering .",
    "@xmath98 can be compared directly with the observed abundances .",
    "the light solid - line histograms clearly indicate central photon depletions or flattening within @xmath0 kpc . the apparent si abundance based on the 2.003 kev line is clearly self - absorbed and matches the observations quite well at @xmath99 kpc .",
    "but the amount of photon depletion with conservative scattering is clearly insufficient to explain the observed o abundance .",
    "it is not possible to deepen the central minima by increasing the o abundance @xmath100 ( and line opacity ) in @xmath101 kpc since the global line luminosities would exceed those observed .",
    "the oviii line luminosity may already be too high by about 13 percent .",
    "the central oxygen line luminosity ( abundance ) only levels off and does not decrease toward the origin as observed .",
    "evidently line photons are being lost by absorption .",
    "the central abundances of si and o  @xmath102 and 0.54 respectively  can not be trusted if the line scattering is non - conservative .",
    "since the continuous opacity in a warm plasma with @xmath103k decreases rapidly with photon energy , @xmath104 , the oviii line should suffer @xmath105 times more absorption than the sixiv line , in qualitative agreement with the profiles in figure 2 .",
    "shigeyama ( 1998 ) noted that if the outward diffusion of strong x - ray lines is not considered in the data reduction , the central gas density can be underestimated by @xmath106 percent . to explore this",
    ", we repeated the calculations with @xmath107 increased by 1.5 .",
    "our conclusions are strengthened by this adjustment in the gas density . with higher",
    "@xmath107 the luminosity of the lines within 50 kpc can be matched with a slightly lower central abundance , resulting in central minima in @xmath108 even less pronounced than those in figure 2 .",
    "studies of optical line emission in the central regions of galactic and galaxy group cooling flows reveal widespread random motions typically about @xmath109 of the sound speed in the hot gas ( heckman et al .",
    "1989 ; caon et al .",
    "2000 ) . since small , optically visible line - emitting regions at @xmath110",
    "k are likely to be strongly coupled to the ambient hot gas , we infer that the hot gas must share the same turbulent velocities .",
    "turbulence is expected to strongly influence the spatial distribution of x - ray resonance lines , particularly for more massive line - emitting ions ( equation 4 ) .",
    "to demonstrate this , we repeated the transfer calculations for both lines with @xmath111 assuming a turbulent mach number @xmath112 . in the presence of turbulence , which we regard as more realistic , the line center optical depths",
    "are greatly reduced ( fig .",
    "1 ) , there is less outward diffusion ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and the apparent central depletion of silicon photons is significantly reduced .",
    "we have also computed line profiles for the fexxv 6.69 kev ( he 4 ) resonance line discussed by bhringer et al . but have not discussed its profile here because emission in this line is unlikely to be representative of the intrinsic iron abundance .",
    "the fexxv 6.69 kev line is very sensitive to the ( low ) cooling flow temperatures @xmath113 in @xmath114 kpc where the line transfer is most relevant ( e.g. fig . 2 of buote , canizares & fabian 1999 ) and relatively few fexxv line photons",
    "are created in this low temperature region . because of this , the @xmath115 iron abundance determination in m87 by bhringer et al .",
    "is dominated by the multitude of strong fe l lines near @xmath116 kev .",
    "the many lines that constitute the fe l feature have different atomic parameters , so no single l line can faithfully represent the iron abundance , as we have assumed for the o and si lyman-@xmath27 lines . since the continuous plasma opacity varies as @xmath104 , the opacity at the fexxv 6.69 kev is @xmath117 times less than the opacity at the oviii 0.652 kev line .",
    "an observation of the equivalent width of the essentially unabsorbed fexxv 6.69 kev line with projected radius in m87 would allow a calculation of the intrinsic iron abundance distribution , provided @xmath113 is sufficiently well determined .",
    "we conclude that the central minima in apparent abundances and line luminosities in m87 can not be understood solely in terms of conservative photon scattering .",
    "an additional source of continuous opacity seems to be required .",
    "we speculate that the source of this opacity is the warm absorbing gas at @xmath1 k as suggested for m87 by buote ( 2000 ) .",
    "buote s conclusion is derived from modeling the rosat pspc data of m87 with coronal plasma emission modified by a single absorption edge and galactic absorption .",
    "the rest energy of the edge is determined to lie at @xmath118 kev , near the position of the oviii l@xmath27 line .",
    "the absorption derived from the rosat data ( @xmath119 ) is spatially more extended than that required to account for central minima in the x - ray resonance lines .",
    "because of the limited energy resolution of rosat , the effect of using a simple absorption edge can not be distinguished from a model in which the o abundance is allowed to take low values as done by bhringer et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "the central declines in fe and si abundances in the bhringer et al .",
    "data are difficult to understand since we expect hot gas closer to the galactic core to be more enriched by centrally peaked stellar mass loss and type ia supernovae ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) . since the oxygen abundance found by bhringer et al .",
    "has a generally negative gradient beyond @xmath120 , it is apparent that the stellar and type ia ejecta are more oxygen - rich than cooling flow gas entering m87 from larger radii , so a central peak in the o abundance would also be expected .",
    "the need for an additional source of continuous opacity in our line transfer calculations lends new support to the absorption interpretation .",
    "if this absorption arises from warm gas , then its mass is similar to that of the hot gas ( buote 2000 ) .",
    "the energy source that heats the warm gas is of great interest .",
    "while some of the cooling flow gas may be heated by the m87 jet , this region is avoided in the bhringer et al .",
    "observations ; the deep central minimum in their @xmath113 shows no evidence of agn heating .",
    "the most likely energy source for heating the warm gas is the turbulent motion of the hot gas as indicated by the dispersion velocity of optical emission lines @xmath121 km s@xmath122 in m87 ( heckman et al . 1989 ) .",
    "these velocities are subsonic in the hot gas , but would be supersonic in the warm , x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "colliding regions of warm gas would be shock - heated at at a rate @xmath123 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath122 where @xmath124 is the filling factor of warm gas clouds of mean radius @xmath125 and electron density @xmath126 .",
    "although we expect that some net cooling occurs , if shock heating balances radiative cooling @xmath127 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath122 then the cloud size can be estimated : @xmath128 pc for @xmath129 km s@xmath122 , @xmath130 @xmath4 and cooling coefficient @xmath131 erg @xmath132 s@xmath122 . with @xmath133 , this cloud size is consistent with the scale of irregularities observed in the optical line emission and the relative uniformity of the warm plasma absorption .    finally , we speculate further that such extended absorbing regions are generally present in cooling flows and account for the apparent deficiency of emission lines characteristic of cooling ions in the centers of these flows ( e.g. peterson et al .",
