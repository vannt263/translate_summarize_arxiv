    "recently there has been considerable progress in the determination of the vector and axial - vector hadronic spectral functions from the semileptonic decays of the @xmath0 lepton @xcite@xcite . using the qcd predictions for the moments of these spectral functions",
    "one may obtain constraints on @xmath3 and the parameters characterizing the nonperturbative qcd dynamics ( @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the accuracy of the obtained value of @xmath3 appears to be quite high . in order to have a proper understanding of the phenomenological relevance of this determination of @xmath3",
    "it is important to make a careful estimate the theoretical uncertainties in the qcd predictions @xcite@xcite . in this note",
    "we investigate the uncertainties in the evaluation of the perturbative part of the qcd prediction for the spectral moments , for which the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) approximation is available .",
    "we study in some detail the sensitivity of the perturbative qcd predictions to the choice of the renormalization scheme ( rs ) and the effect of the rs dependence on the fitted values of the qcd parameters .",
    "let us begin by summarizing the theoretical framework adopted in the analysis of the @xmath0 decay data @xcite@xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested to use the @xmath4 moments , defined by the relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the invariant mass distribution for the cabbibo allowed semileptonic @xmath0 decays in the vector ( v ) or axial - vector ( a ) channel and @xmath7 denotes the electronic width of the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "the qcd predictions for @xmath4 have the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ckm matrix element ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 represents the correction from electroweak interactions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 factor denotes the parton model prediction  for later use we shall need @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 term denotes the perturbative contribution , evaluated for 3 massless quarks .",
    "( the @xmath16 and @xmath17 quark mass effects are negligible , the @xmath18 quark mass effects are very small for non - strange decays and the @xmath19 quark is considered to be decoupled @xcite . ) the @xmath15 term is universal for the v and a channels . the @xmath20 term in  ( [ eq : rklpred ] )",
    "denotes the contribution from the nonperturbative qcd effects , which are estimated using the svz approach  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the vacuum expectation values of the gauge invariant operators of dimension @xmath23 and @xmath24 are coefficients specific for the considered spectral moment and the type of the operator .",
    "the @xmath24 coefficients are in principle power series in the strong coupling constant .",
    "the object of greatest interest is of course the total decay rate for the cabbibo allowed semileptonic @xmath0 decays in the vector / axial - vector channels , @xmath25 .",
    "the perturbative correction to this moment is sizeable and it is highly sensitive to the value of the strong coupling , due to the low characteristic energy scale of @xmath26 .",
    "the higher @xmath27 moments are introduced to take advantage of the the full information contained in the hadronic spectral functions . by using the predictions for",
    "several @xmath27 moments one may obtain a simultaneous fit of @xmath1 and of some of the condensates @xmath22 . in this way",
    "the whole analysis becomes self - consistent and in addition one obtains a check on both the perturbative and the nonperturbative qcd contributions .",
    "the perturbative qcd corrections @xmath28 are evaluated using a contour integral expression @xcite , which relates them to the qcd correction @xmath29 to the so called adler function @xcite , i.e. the logarithmic derivative of the transverse part of the vector / axial - vector current correlator @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eq : defadler}\\ ] ] ( in the approximation of massless quarks the perturbative contributions to the adler functions for the vector and axial - vector current correlators are identical . ) we have : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a weight function specific to the considered moment and @xmath34 is a contour running clockwise from @xmath35 to @xmath36 away from the region of small @xmath37 . in the following",
    "we shall need the weight functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 @xmath41    the nnlo renormalization group improved perturbative expansion for @xmath29 may be written in the form : @xmath42 , \\label{eq : dpert}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes the running coupling constant that satisfies the nnlo renormalization group ( rg ) equation : @xmath44 in the modified minimal subtraction @xmath2 scheme ( i.e. using @xmath2 subtraction procedure and choosing @xmath45 ) we have @xcite@xcite for @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the renormalization group coefficients for @xmath46 are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the qcd predictions for the @xmath28 are usually calculated in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath2 ) renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "however , in the nnlo approximation with massless quarks there is a two - parameter freedom in choosing the rs .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in each order of perturbation expansion the finite parts of the renormalization constant for the coupling constant may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "different choices of the finite parts of the renormalization constant result in different definitions of the coupling constant , which are related by a finite renormalization .",
    "this results in a change of values of the coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "( we restrict our discussion to the class of mass and gauge independent schemes , for which the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 are universal . )",
    "the formulas describing how the redefinition of the coupling affects the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath54 are collected for example in  @xcite .",
    "the dimensional qcd parameter @xmath58 also depends on the choice of the rs  @xcite . in the nnlo there",
    "exists however a rs invariant combination of the expansion coefficients  @xcite@xcite : @xmath59 for the @xmath60 we have @xmath61 .",
    "the change in the expansion coefficients and the change in the coupling constant compensate each other , but of course in the finite order of perturbation expansion such compensation may only be approximate , which results in the numerical rs dependence of the perturbative predictions .",
    "this rs dependence is formally of higher order in the coupling constant , but in the case of the @xmath0 decay it may be significant numerically , since the coupling is not very small at the energy scale of @xmath62 .",
    "it is therefore very important to verify to what extent the rs dependence affects the predictions and the fits to the experimental data .",
    "the authors of @xcite used the @xmath27 moments with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and fitted the @xmath65 condensates . since the aim of this note is primarily to study the theoretical uncertainties in the whole procedure we shall adopt a simplified approach , which still has considerable phenomenological relevance .",
    "this approach is based on the fact that the dominant nonperturbative contribution to @xmath25 in the svz expansion comes from the @xmath66 term @xcite , because the @xmath67 term is suppressed by additional power of @xmath3 .",
    "we shall therefore neglect the @xmath67 contribution to the total decay rate and  for consistency  the higher order correction to the @xmath66 coefficient .",
    "( such an approximation was in fact made already in @xcite . ) in the following we shall also neglect contributions from the @xmath68 condensates . in order to be able to fit the @xmath66 condensate together with @xmath3 we shall use the qcd prediction for the @xmath69 moment , which similarly to @xmath25 has a suppressed contribution from the @xmath67 condensate . neglecting in @xmath69 the contributions from @xmath68 condensates we obtain a simple set of self - consistent formulas . in our approximation : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the leading @xmath66 contribution to the transverse part of the hadronic vacuum polarization function : @xmath72 this contribution is dominated by the four - quark condensates @xcite . in the phenomenological analysis",
    "it is usually expressed in a simplified form , motivated by the chiral symmetry and the vacuum saturation approximation  @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the quark condensate , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is an effective parameter , characterizing the deviation from the strict vacuum saturation .    in our study of the rs dependence effects",
    "we parametrize the freedom of choice of the rs by the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath54 , following the conventions of our previous work  @xcite . to obtain the perturbative qcd corrections @xmath28 we evaluate the contour integral numerically , using under the integral a numerical solution of the rg equation ( [ eq : rge ] ) in the complex energy plane . in this way",
    "we take full advantage of the rg - invariance properties of the perturbative prediction and we resum to all orders some of the large terms which would otherwise appear in the perturbation expansion  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the integration contour @xmath34 is a circle @xmath78 , @xmath79 $ ] . to determine the numerical value of the running coupling constant on the contour @xmath34 we solve the transcendental equation , which results from integration of the rg equation ( [ eq : rge ] ) with a suitable boundary condition and analytic continuation to the complex energy plane : @xmath80 where in nlo @xmath81 and in nnlo for @xmath82    @xmath83    the presence of @xmath84 in the expression valid for arbitrary scheme follows from our taking into account explicitly the relation between @xmath58 parameters in different schemes @xcite and using @xmath84 as a reference parameter .",
    "after evaluating the predictions for @xmath85 and @xmath86 we perform the fits to the experimental data for @xmath25 and @xmath87 .",
    "we use the experimental values reported recently by aleph @xcite : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 . in the fits",
    "we assume for simplicity that the experimental errors for @xmath92 and @xmath93 are not correlated .",
    "we express the results of our fits in terms of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "( we actually fit the value of @xmath84 , which we then convert to @xmath94 using the rg equation in the @xmath96 scheme . ) for comparison with other determinations of the strong coupling constant we extrapolate @xmath3 from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "our procedure for extrapolation relies on the matching formula relating @xmath99 to @xmath100 : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the running quark mass @xmath104 of the heavy quark evaluated at the scale @xmath105 .",
    "( the nnlo matching formula of that form was originally proposed in @xcite , see also discussion in @xcite . however , in @xcite it was found that a numerical coefficient in the nnlo term is actually different , which was subsequently confirmed in @xcite .",
    "we use the coefficient of @xcite . ) in order to evolve @xmath3 from scale @xmath106 to the scale @xmath107 we solve the equation : @xmath108 to obtain @xmath109 from the given value of @xmath1 we first evolve @xmath3 from the scale @xmath62 to the scale of @xmath110 using the @xmath46 rg equation , then we use the matching formula ( [ eq : match ] ) to obtain @xmath111 , evolve this to the scale of @xmath112 using the @xmath113 rg equation , use the matching formula to obtain @xmath114 , and finally evolve this to the scale of @xmath115 using the @xmath116 rg equation .",
    "we use @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which are the central values recommended by the review of particle properties @xcite . in table",
    "[ tb : match ] we give for reference some values of @xmath1 and @xmath109 as a function of @xmath119 in the nnlo approximation .",

    "it is clear that regardless of our choice of the concrete optimal scheme there is a continuum of schemes , which seem to be equally reasonable .",
    "predictions in such schemes should also be somehow taken into account in the phenomenological analysis .",
    "a natural way to do this is to supplement the prediction in a preferred scheme with an estimate of the variation of the predictions over a whole set of _ a priori _ acceptable schemes .",
    "a concrete realization of this idea was presented in @xcite , based on the existence of the rs invariant @xmath120 , which provides a natural rs independent characterization of the magnitude of the nnlo corrections for the considered physical quantity . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed to calculate variation of the predictions over the set of schemes for which the expansion coefficients satisfy the condition : @xmath121 where @xmath122 a motivation for the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) is that it eliminates schemes in which the expansions ( [ eq : dpert ] ) and ( [ eq : rge ] ) involve unnaturally large expansion coefficients that introduce large cancellations in the expression for the rs invariant @xmath120 .",
    "the constant @xmath123 in the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) controls the degree of cancellation that we want to allow in the expression for @xmath120 . in our case",
    "we have for the pms parameters @xmath124 , so in order to take into account the schemes , which have the same  or smaller  degree of cancellation as the pms scheme we take @xmath125 .",
    "one may expect , that the estimate of the rs dependence obtained according to this prescription would be useful for a quantitative comparison of reliability of perturbative predictions for different physical quantities , evaluated at different energies .",
    "it is also clear that any large variation of the predictions over a set of schemes satisfying the constraint ( [ eq : condition ] ) with @xmath125 would be an unambiguous sign of a limited applicability of the nnlo expression .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfitvecrsdep ] we show how the value of @xmath94 resulting from the fit depends on the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath54 specifying the renormalization scheme in nnlo . in the region of scheme parameters satisfying condition  ( [ eq : condition ] ) with @xmath125 the minimum value of @xmath126 ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 )",
    "is attained for @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and the maximum value of @xmath131 ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) is attained for @xmath134 and @xmath130 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath2 scheme parameters lie outside the @xmath125 region , but the fitted value of @xmath1 in this scheme coincides with the maximal value quoted above .",
    "it is also important to note that one of the other potentially interesting schemes , for which the nnlo expressions recently became available @xcite  the so called v  scheme @xcite  corresponds to the rs parameters @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which lie very far outside the @xmath125 region .",
    "it seems that the large value of @xmath54 in the v  scheme restricts its usefulness for the low energy perturbative predictions , because of the influence of the landau pole in the rg equation .",
    "it is of some interest to perform the same fits using instead the nlo predictions . using the nlo predictions in the @xmath2 scheme ,",
    "we obtain @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which translates via nlo rg equation into @xmath139 , which in turn corresponds via nlo extrapolation to @xmath140 .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath141 is practically identical to that obtained in the nnlo fit .",
    "however , the value of the strong coupling constant is surprisingly high and it is significantly different from the nnlo value .",
    "using the nlo predictions in the pms scheme we obtain @xmath142 and @xmath143 , which corresponds to @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we see that although the difference in the nlo and nnlo values of @xmath84 obtained in the pms fits is still considerable , it is nevertheless much smaller than in the case of the @xmath2 scheme .",
    "( if we look at @xmath146 instead of @xmath84 this difference is even smaller , although this may be partially a result of a fortuitous compensation between different factors influencing the evaluation of @xmath3 in various orders . ) for completeness we give the nlo results in the ec scheme : @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "these numbers provide a nice illustration of the fact , that the difference between the nlo and nnlo predictions is strongly scheme dependent . therefore ,",
    "if such a difference is to be used in any way to estimate the precision of the qcd prediction , some way of making a preferred choice of the renormalization scheme must be employed .",
    "so far our discussion was concentrated primarily on the value of @xmath94 coming from the fit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d6fitvecrsdep ] we show the rs dependence of the fitted value of @xmath141 .",

    "using the eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacsat ] ) we may translate this into the range @xmath150 for the commonly used parameter @xmath151 .",
    "this seems to be in reasonable agreement with the values obtained previously by other authors , for example @xmath152 obtained in the original work of svz @xcite or @xmath153 obtained in a more recent analysis @xcite .",
    "similarly as in the case of the vector channel we start with the fit in the @xmath2 scheme .",
    "we obtain @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which corresponds to @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the result of this fit should be compared with @xmath158 , obtained by aleph in a more complete fit @xcite .",
    "we find that the difference between our results and the aleph result is slightly bigger than in the case of vector channel .",
    "it should be noted however that the aleph fit in the axial - vector channel has surprisingly large @xmath67 contribution , which would be difficult to justify theoretically .    performing the nnlo fit in the pms scheme we obtain @xmath159 and @xmath160 , which corresponds to @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "similarly as in the case of the vector channel we find appreciable reduction in the extracted value of @xmath1 as compared to the values obtained in the @xmath2 scheme .    to make our results useful in the case of future improvements of the experimental analysis we show in fig .",

    "we also perform the nlo fits . using the @xmath2 scheme , we obtain @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which translates via nlo rg equation into @xmath174 , which in turn corresponds via nlo extrapolation to @xmath175 . in the pms scheme",
    "we obtain @xmath176 and @xmath177 , which implies @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "similarly as in the vector channel case we note a rather large difference between nlo and nnlo in the case of the @xmath2 scheme , which is significantly reduced if the preferred scheme is pms . in nlo in the ec scheme",
    "we obtain @xmath176 and @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "our discussion of the rs dependence of the qcd predictions and the fits may be summarized as follows :    * changing the scheme from the @xmath2 scheme to the pms scheme we obtain a reduction in the extracted value of @xmath94 by approximately 0.01 ( @xmath182 is reduced by 0.001 ) .",
    "also , the difference between the nlo and nnlo results is much smaller in the pms scheme than in the @xmath2 scheme . * varying the scheme parameters @xmath52 and @xmath54 in the region satisfying the condition  ( [ eq : condition ] ) with @xmath125 we obtain an uncertainty in the extracted value of @xmath94 of approximately 0.02 ( uncertainty in @xmath182 is 0.002 ) .",
    "as was argued in the text , this set of scheme parameters seems to be a minimal set that one should take into account in the discussion of the rs dependence .",
    "our general conclusion is that the perturbative predictions for the qcd effects in the inclusive decay rates for the semileptonic @xmath0 decays appear to be relatively precise , despite the rather low energy scale .",
    "it should be emphasized however , that in the discussion of the final precision of @xmath3 extracted from the @xmath0 decays one should also take into account the approximate character of the svz expansion itself @xcite .",
