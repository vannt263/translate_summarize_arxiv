    "in quantum information science it is a crucial problem to develop techniques for generating entanglement among stationary qubits .",
    "entanglement as unique feature of quantum mechanics  can be used not only to test fundamental quantum - mechanical principles @xcite , but to play a central role in applications @xcite .",
    "especially , multipartite entanglement has been recognized as a powerful resource in quantum information processing and communication .",
    "there are two typical multipartite entangled states , greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w states , which are usually referred to as maximal entanglement .",
    "numerous protocols for the preparation of such states have been proposed @xcite .",
    "most of them are scattering - based schemes which utilize two processes : the natural dynamic process of an always on system and the final project process carried out by a subsequent measurement .",
    "another feature of such kind of schemes is that there are two kinds of qubits involved in : target qubits and flying qubit .",
    "the target qubits are the main entities that will be entangled by the above two processes , which are usually stationary and can be realized by atoms , impurities , or other quantum devices .",
    "the flying qubit is amediator to establish the entanglement among the target qubits via the interaction between them , which is usually realized by photon or mobile electron .    in this sense ,",
    "the type of interaction between stationary qubits and the flying qubit as a mediator and the transfer of the flying qubit are crucial for the efficiency of the entanglement creation . in general ,",
    "such two processes are mutually exclusive",
    ". the scattering between stationary and flying qubits can convert information between them , while it also reduces the fidelity of the flying qubit , which will affect the efficiency of the entanglement , especially for multi - particle system .",
    "it is still a challenge to create entanglement among massive , or stationary qubits .    in this paper",
    ", we consider whether it is possible to use an arrangement of qubits , a spin network , to generate multipartite entanglement among stationary qubits via scattering process .",
    "we introduce a scheme that allow the generation of the ghz and w states of stationary qubits in spin networks . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the flying qubit is a gaussian type single - flip moving wave packet on the ferromagnetic background , which can propagate freely in @xmath4 chain .",
    "the stationary qubit is consisted of two spins coupled by ising type interaction with strength @xmath5 .",
    "a single spin flip can be confined inside such two spins by local magnetic field @xmath6 to form a  double - dot ( dd ) qubit .",
    "the system of an @xmath4 spin chain with a dd qubit embedded in exhibits a novel feature under the resonance scattering condition @xmath7 , that a single - flip moving wave packet can completely pass over a dd qubit and switch it from state @xmath8 to @xmath9 simultaneously .",
    "we show that the scattering between a flying qubit and a dd qubit can induce the entanglement between them and the operation on the dd qubit can be performed by the measurement of the output flying qubit .",
    "it allows simple schemes for generation of multipartite entanglement , such as ghz and w states by simply - designed spin networks .",
    "we also investigate the influence of near - resonance effects on the success probabilities of the schemes .",
    "it is found that the success probabilities are @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath2  for the generation of ghz and w states , respectively .",
    "here @xmath3 is the transmission probability amplitude for a single dd qubit and @xmath0 is the number of the dd qubits .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the dd qubit and spin network are presented . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the resonance - scattering process between the flying and stationary qubits .",
    "iv and v are devoted to the application of the resonance scattering on schemes of creating ghz and w states .",
    "section vi is the summary and discussion .",
    "the spin network we consider in this paper is consisted of spins connected via the @xmath12 interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath13 \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i}h_{i}\\sigma _ { i}^{z } ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xmath16 are the pauli spin matrices for the spin at site @xmath17 .",
    "the total @xmath18-component of spin , or the number of spin flips on the ferromagnetic background , is conserved as it commutes with the hamiltonian .  for @xmath19",
    ", it reduces to @xmath4 spin network , which has received a wide study for the purpose of quantum state transfer and creating entanglement between distant qubits by using the natural dynamics @xcite . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the hamiltonian describes isotropic heisenberg model . in the antiferromagnetic regime ( @xmath21 ) , a ladder geometry spin network , a gapped system @xcite , has been employed as a data bus for the swapping operation and generation of entanglement between two distant stationary qubits .",
    "it has been shown that a moving wave packet can act as a flying qubit @xcite like photon in a fiber .",
    "on the other hand , the analogues of optical device , beam splitter can be fabricated in quantum networks of bosonic plenio , spin and ferimonic systems @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a new type of qubit , double - dot qubit , which can be embedded in such spin networks .",
    "a dd qubit consists of two ordinary spins at sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 connected via ising type interaction in the form@xmath24when such kinds of two spins are embedded in the spin networks with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , a spin flip is confined within it and forms a dd qubit with the notations @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we will show that such a new type of qubit has a novel feature when it interacts with another spin flip in the spin networks .",
    "the main building block in the spin network of our scheme is the dd qubit .",
    "it acts as a massive or stationary qubit , like atoms or ions in cavity - qed - based schemes . to demonstrate the property of a dd qubit in a spin chain",
    ", we investigate a small system of @xmath29-site , a dd qubit connecting to two spins . in order to provide a clear exposition , we firstly assume a specific coupling configuration with @xmath7 , which leads to the following @xmath29-site hamiltonian@xmath30there is a quasi - invariant subspace with the diagonal energy being @xmath6 and under the condition @xmath31 , which is spanned by basis@xmath32the matrix of the hamiltonian in this subspace reads@xmath33\\]]with eigenstates @xmath34 and eigen energies @xmath35  @xmath36  being @xmath37obviously , in the invariant subspace , such a @xmath29-site system acts as a normal @xmath38-site system . note that the dd qubit as the center of the @xmath38-site system can be in two different states @xmath8 or @xmath39 while another spin flip is at left or right site .",
    "thus a time evolution process can accomplish the transformation @xmath40 or @xmath41  with 100% success probability .",
    "such a feature is desirable for the quantum information processing .",
    "it is because that , on one hand , a spin flip passing over a dd qubit can operate the qubit state ; and on the other hand , the state of a dd qubit can indicate whether there is a spin flip passing over it . a similar transformation has been proposed through the cavity input - output process in adiabatic limit @xcite .",
    "a particular merit of the present scheme is that it is based on a natural dynamic process rather than an adiabatic process .",
    "now we consider the dynamic process of the interaction between a moving wave packet and a dd qubit .",
    "we embed a dd qubit into a chain as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "it has been shown that a single - spin - flip wave packet in the form @xcite@xmath42can propagate along a uniform spin chain without spreading approximately , where the vacuum state is fully ferromagnetic state @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the normalization factor , @xmath45  is the center of the wave packet at @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the number of sites of the chain . at time",
    "@xmath3 , it will evolves to @xmath48 .",
    "let us firstly assume that initially the qubit is in the state @xmath49 , while a wave packet of type ( [ single p ] ) @xmath50 @xmath51 is coming from the left .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 to denote a transmitted or reflected wave packet after scattering . in the strong local field regime , @xmath56 ,",
    "the spin flip is firmly confined in the dd qubit . from the analysis of the above @xmath29-site system , which is called the resonant case with @xmath7 , the wave packet will pass freely through the dd qubit . comparing to the case without the embedded dd qubit , the output wave packet gets a forward shift with a lattice space , while switches the dd qubit from @xmath57  to @xmath58 , i.e. ,    @xmath59    in contrast , if the qubit is in state @xmath9 ,",
    "the scattering process is    @xmath60    i.e. , the incoming wave packet is totally reflected and maintains the qubit to be in state @xmath58 .",
    "interestingly , the states of wave packet and the dd qubit  are both  altered through this process , i.e. , being shifted with a lattice space .",
    "however , such a shift brings about totally different effects on the dd qubit and the wave packet , respectively : it switches the dd qubit from @xmath61  to @xmath62 , but does not  alter the wave packet in the same manner  as _ classical _ perfect elastic collision .",
    "it is worthy to point out that the dd qubit and the wave packet are not  entangled in such resonant case . in the case of non - resonance @xmath63 , or",
    "initially the dd qubit and/or the incident wave packet are in a superposition states as    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are arbitrary coefficients satisfying @xmath67 .    in practice",
    ", the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath5 will leads to the reflection of the incident wave packet .",
    "then the scattering process can be expressed as    @xmath68    with @xmath69 .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath70 is a crucial factor in the following schemes for quantum information processing . on the other hand",
    ", the strength of the local field @xmath6 also results the spreading of the spin flip from state @xmath58  and reduces @xmath71 .",
    "we perform numerical simulation for the scattering process in order to investigate such phenomenon .",
    "numerical result for @xmath72  with @xmath73 is plotted in fig .",
    "it shows that the transmission coefficient is close to @xmath74 if @xmath75 , which is feasible in practice .",
    "it ensures that a spin network with an embedded dd qubit in a spin chain can perform the transformation ( [ tran1 ] , [ tran2 ] ) via a natural dynamic process rather than an adiabatic process .",
    "now we focus on the practical application of resonant scattering effect on the quantum information processing .",
    "as mentioned above , although the totally transmitted wave packet switches the state of the dd qubit from @xmath76  to @xmath58 , there is no entanglement between the dd and the wave packet arising from such a process .",
    "however , if the incoming wave packet is not polarized in @xmath18 direction , but in the form    @xmath77    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are restricted to be real for simplicity in the following context , the entanglement between the dd qubit and the scattered wave packet can be established .",
    "actually , the corresponding resonant scattering process can be expressed as    @xmath78    the reduced density matrix of the final state in the basis @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is@xmath83 , \\]]which has concurrence @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the concurrence between them reaches to the maximum @xmath86 .",
    "a flying qubit ( [ wp_in ] ) can be generated from wave packet ( [ single p ] ) via a @xmath87-beam or @xmath88-beam splitter @xcite .",
    "we consider the spin network with the geometry of two connected @xmath87-beam splitters .",
    "these two @xmath88-beam splitters are characterized by @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively , which are schematically shown in fig .",
    "fig3(a ) . there is a dd qubit embedded in one of the two arms .",
    "now we consider the dynamic process with the initial state being @xmath91 , where @xmath92,denotes an incoming wave packet along the left chain . in the first step , through the beam splitter @xmath93",
    ",  @xmath94  is divided into two wave packets @xmath95  and @xmath96  along @xmath97 and @xmath98 arms , respectively . in the second step ,",
    "sub - wave packet @xmath99 passes over dd qubit and becomes @xmath100 , while sub - wave packet @xmath101 propagates along @xmath98 arm and meets @xmath102 at the joint of beam splitter @xmath90 . in the third step , wave packets @xmath103  and",
    "@xmath101are reflected and divided by beam splitter @xmath104 , and contribute to the output wave packet @xmath105 .",
    "then the whole process can be expressed as    @xmath106    from step 2 to step 3 we have used formulas ( [ alfa in ] , [ beta in ] ) derived in appendix a. when @xmath107 is measured in the output lead , the operation @xmath108is implemented .",
    "the success probability of this operation is @xmath109 . in the optimal case with @xmath110 @xmath111",

    "multipartite entangled ghz state can be generated .",
    "this provides a simple way of entangling @xmath0 stationary qubits through scattering with a flying qubit . in the near - resonance scattering case , the transmission probability amplitude @xmath3 will effect the success probability to be @xmath118under the optimal conditions @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "note that the success probability is reduced exponentially as the number of qubits increases .",
    "now we turn to the scheme of the generation of another type of multipartite entangled state , w state . the configuration of the spin network we utilized consists of two @xmath121-beam splitters  with one dd qubit embedded in each parallel arm in the same way , as illustrated in fig . [",
