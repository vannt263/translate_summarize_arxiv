    "our knowledge on deep inside of matter has been essentially provided by means of lepton - hadron collisions .",
    "for example , electron scattering on atomic nuclei reveals structure of nucleons in hofstadter experiment @xcite .",
    "moreover , quark parton model was originated from lepton hadron - collisions @xcite . extending the kinematic region by two orders of magnitude",
    "both in high @xmath1 and small x , hera with @xmath2 tev has shown its superiority compared to the fixed target experiments and provided parton distribution functions ( pdf ) for lhc experiments .",
    "unfortunately , the region of sufficiently small x ( @xmath3 ) and high @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) , where saturation of parton densities should manifest itself , has not been reached yet .",
    "hopefully , lhec @xcite @xmath5 tev will give opportunity to investigate this region .",
    "construction of linear @xmath6colliders ( or special linacs ) and muon colliders tangential to the future circular collider ( fcc ) as shown in fig .",
    "1 will give opportunity to achieve multi - tev center of mass energy in lepton - hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "fcc is the future 100 tev center - of - mass energy pp collider proposed at cern and supported by european union within the horizon 2020 framework programme for research and innovation .",
    "main parameters of the fcc pp option @xcite are presented in table i. the fcc also includes an electron - positron collider option at the same tunnel ( tlep ) @xcite , as well as several ep collider options @xcite .",
    ".main parameters of proton beams in fcc . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as one can see from the third column of the table vii number of protons in bunches are huge in options corresponding to the highest energy electron beams , therefore one may wonder about ibs growth times . for this reason we estimate horizontal ibs growth times using wei formula @xcite .",
    "obtained results are presented in the last two columns of the table vii . in numerical calculations we used fodo cell lengths values @xmath7=106.9 m ( same as lhc ) and @xmath7=203.0 m considered in @xcite .",
    "it is seen that ibs growth times are acceptable even for @xmath8 gev case .",
    "in this study it is shown that for ilc@xmath9fcc and pwfa - lc@xmath9fcc based ep colliders luminosity values up to @xmath0 are achievable with moderate upgrade of the fcc proton beam . even with these luminosity values bsm",
    "search potential of ep colliders essentially exceeds that of corresponding linear colliders and is comparable with search potential of the fcc pp option for a lot of bsm phenomena . in principle , `` dynamic focusing '' scheme @xcite , which was proposed for thera , could provide @xmath10 for all ep collider options considered in this study .",
    "concerning ilc@xmath9fcc based ep colliders , a new scheme for energy recovery proposed for higher - energy lhec ( see section 7.1.5 in @xcite ) may give an opportunity to increase luminosity by an additional one or two orders , resulting in @xmath11 exceeding @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , this scheme can not be applied at pwfa - lc@xmath9fcc .",
    "acceleration of ion beams at the fcc @xcite will give opportunity to provide multi - tev center of mass energy in electron - nucleus collisions .",
    "in addition , electron beam can be converted to high energy photon beam using compton back - scattering of laser photons ( see @xciteand references therein ) which will give opportunity to construct lc@xmath9fcc based @xmath13 and @xmath14 colliders ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in conclusion , construction of ilc and pwfa - lc tangential to the fcc will essentially enlarge the physics search potential for both sm and bsm phenomena .",
    "therefore , systematic study of accelerator and detector , as well as physics search potential , issues of lc@xmath9fcc based lepton - hadron and photon - hadron colliders are essential to foreseen the future of high energy physics .",
