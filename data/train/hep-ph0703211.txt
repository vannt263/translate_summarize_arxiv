    "as we know there are stringent experimental constraints against the existence of tree - level flavor changing scalar interactions(fcsi s ) for light quarks . it leads to the suppression of the flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) couplings at the lowest order .",
    "this is also an important feature of the standard model(sm)@xcite .",
    "even the one - loop flavor changing effect in the sm is still small , due to the suppression of the glashow - iliopulos - maiani(gim ) mechanism@xcite . in extension models beyond the sm when new non - standard particles exist in the loops , significant contributions to flavor changing transitions",
    "may appear . among various new physics models ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension(mssm)@xcite is widely considered as the one of the most appealing extensions of the sm .",
    "the mssm not only can explain the existing experimental data as the sm does , but also can be used to solve various theoretical problems in the sm , such as the huge hierarchy problem between the electroweak symmetry - breaking and the grand unification scales . in the mssm there exist two higgs doublets to break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "after symmetry breaking , there are five physical higgs bosons : two cp - even higgs bosons(@xmath3 ) , one cp - odd boson(@xmath4)and two charged higgs bosons(@xmath5)@xcite",
    ". significant difference exists between the couplings involving higgs boson in the mssm and those in the sm . in susy models ,",
    "an important feature is that the fermion - higgs couplings are no longer strictly proportional only to the corresponding mass as they are in the sm .",
    "for example , the b - quark coupling with neutral higgs boson @xmath4 in the mssm becomes enhanced for large @xmath6 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values@xcite .",
    "thus , different features can be presented due to the existence of the five higgs bosons in the mssm which might lead different coupling strengths , decay widths and production cross sections compared with in the sm .",
    "the understanding of flavor sector is a major challenge for various extension models of the sm . in the mssm ,",
    "the minimal flavor violation is realized by the ckm - matrix@xcite . while in the general mssm with flavor violation , a possible flavor - mixings between the three sfermion generations are allowed and lead to flavor changing effects .",
    "the flavor changing effects originating from such sfermion - mixing scenario normally can not be generated at the tree - level , but could show up at the one - loop level and induce significant contributions to be observed in specific regions of the mssm parameters .",
    "searching for scalar higgs bosons is one of the major objectives of present and future high energy experiments . in most extensions of the sm , the mass of a charged higgs boson(@xmath7 )",
    "is predicted to be around the weak scale .",
    "however , the higgs bosons havent been directly explored experimentally until now . at hadron colliders , such as the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider(lhc )",
    ", a light charged higgs boson can be produced from the decay of top quark via @xmath8 , if @xmath9@xcite .",
    "otherwise , if the charged higgs boson is heavier than top quark , there are three major channels to search for charged higgs boson : ( 1)charged higgs boson pair production@xcite ; ( 2)associated production of a charged higgs boson with a w boson@xcite ; ( 3)associated production of a charged higgs boson with a top quark @xmath10@xcite ; ( 4)single charged higgs production @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the decay of the charged higgs boson has two major channels : @xmath12@xcite , and @xmath13@xcite . at the lhc ,",
    "the most promising channel to search for the charged higgs boson in some specific parameter space , is @xmath14 , whose qcd corrections have been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 process is another important alternative channel especially considering the contributions from squark - guino loops with flavor mixing structure .",
    "diaz - cruz , et al .",
    ", analyzed susy radiative corrections to the @xmath1 and @xmath15 couplings including squark - mixing effects , and showed that these couplings can reveal exciting new discovery channels for the higgs boson signals at the tevatron and the lhc@xcite .",
    "he , et al , . studied the single",
    "charged higgs production process at linear colliders , such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19@xcite .",
    "the flavor changing effect on the neutral higgs boson production associated with a bottom - strange quark pair in the mssm at the linear collider was studied in ref.@xcite .    as we know , among the three generations of fermions , the top - quark is the heaviest one with its mass as high as the electroweak scale .",
    "the large top - quark mass will enhance flavor changing yukawa coupling @xmath1 at the loop level and make the single charged higgs production process @xmath0 to be an important channel for probing flavor violation and searching for charged higgs boson at hadron colliders .",
    "furthermore , when the neutral scalar(@xmath20 ) and the charged scalar ( @xmath21 ) form a su(2 ) doublet , the weak isospin symmetry connects the flavor - changing neutral coupling(fcnc ) @xmath22 to the flavor - mixing charged coupling ( fmcc ) @xmath23 through the ( s)quark - mixing matrix .",
    "therefore , if we can directly measure the coupling of fmcc at future high energy colliders , it would provide the detailed information on the fcnc and may give more precise constraints on the fcnc than that inferred from kaon and bottom physics obtained from low energy experiments .",
    "although the electroweak corrections can contribute to the flavor changing effect on the process @xmath0 , but the susy qcd corrections via squark - gluino loops are dominant over the previous ones , at least one order larger in magnitude . in this work , we calculate the single charged higgs boson production process associated with a bottom - charm pair @xmath0 in the mssm with left - handed up - type squark mixings at qcd one - loop level at the cern lhc .",
    "we shall show the importance of squark - mixings in the enhancement of production rate for @xmath0 process .",
    "we analyze the susy qcd radiative contributions to the process @xmath0 by adopting the relevant mssm parameters at the snowmass point sps 4 with large @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as below : in section 2 we present a brief outline on the up - type squark mass matrix considering the left - handed up - type squark mixings , and diagonalize it to obtain the mass eigenstates matrix of squarks . in section 3 ,",
    "we give the calculations of the cross sections of @xmath25 up to the order @xmath26 in the mssm .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , a short summary is given .",
    "in the supersymmetric models , the sm flavor mixings between quarks of three generations can be extended to include the superpartners of quarks and leptons by introducing the supersymmetry soft - breaking meachanism .",
    "these models leave further puzzles to the flavor physics , since the soft - breaking lagrangian of the supersymmetry , which gives a mass spectrum of the supersymmetric particles , involves numerous unconstrained free parameters . in order to fit with low - energy fcnc data , we have to make specific assumptions to these free parameters .    in the study of the @xmath27 production at hadron colliders",
    ", only the flavor mixing in squark sector is concerned . for the down - type squark mixings ,",
    "there are possible strong constraints on the mixing parameters from the low - energy experimental data .",
    "for example , the mechanism with down - type squark mixings in large @xmath24 could enhance the fcnc @xmath28decays by several orders@xcite and seems to be ruled out by @xmath29-factory experiments .",
    "but the up - type squark mixing between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is subject to no strong low - energy constraint@xcite .",
    "such @xmath30-@xmath31 squark mixing is well motivated in low - energy supergravity models ( sugra)@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite shows that at low energy the @xmath30-@xmath31 mixing may be significant due to very heavy top quark , and the mixing between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is most likely to be large , which is proportional to a sum of some soft masses .",
    "for theoretical simplicity in this work , we focus on the mssm with the squark - mixing assumption that only the left - handed up - type squarks in three generations can mix with each other@xcite . in the super cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) basis @xmath34 , the @xmath35 squark mass matrix @xmath36 of up - type squark sector takes the form as@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the mass of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 the up - quark mass and charge . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are mass parameters of supersymmetry soft breaking .",
