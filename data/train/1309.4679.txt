    "the current paradigm of planet formation includes a stage where solid bodies ( `` planetesimals '' ) that have become large enough start decoupling from the aerodynamic drag provided by the gas disk and interacting with each other via gravity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "this regime traditionally comprised objects that have a radius of order of a few kilometers , as predicted by the classical instability scenarios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the role of km - sized planetesimals as the fundamental building blocks of planetary cores is , at best , precarious for the newly discovered circumbinary planets @xcite . indeed ,",
    "simplified simulations of planetesimal accretion have shown that the interplay between the gravitational perturbations of the stellar binary and the aerodynamic drag of the gaseous disk can inhibit planet formation in the inner few aus of the protoplanetary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter m12 ) investigated planetesimal dynamics in the kepler-16 system and found that planetesimal collisions inside at least 4 au ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the binary semi - major axis ) were largely destructive , due to the high collisional velocities .",
    "we proposed that kepler-16 b formed in the outer regions of the disk , and subsequently migrated to its currently observed location ( @xmath4 ) , likely via tidal interaction with the gas disk @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite found that turbulent density fluctuations can potentially further increase impact speeds , pushing the accretion - friendly region out to 10 au ( although a more sophisticated treatment of the stochastic torques might be warranted ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the analysis of m12 , however , assumed a static , axisymmetric gas disk as the source of aerodynamic drag for the sake of computational expediency .",
    "simulations that included the hydrodynamical evolution of the gas disk suggested an even more disturbed environment , due to the development of bulk eccentricity and spiral perturbations in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite self - consistently followed the hydrodynamical evolution of the disk together with a swarm of planetesimals ( with radii of 5 and 25 km ) .",
    "this setup allowed them to record a large number of planetesimal impact events throughout the disk .",
    "the inferred impact velocities ( on the order of 100 - 1000 m  s@xmath5 ) were beyond the critical value for planetesimal destruction .",
    "therefore , they concluded that embryo formation is inhibited everywhere inside about 10 au for km - sized planetesimals , again suggesting the planetary core is formed far from the binary .",
    "the migration scenario is not without its downsides , however .",
    "chiefly , it requires a substantial amount of migration of the planet from the outer disk to its current location ( either through gas torques , or , less likely , driven by a fossil planetesimal disk , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally ,",
    "although impact speeds are reduced below the critical value for destruction outside 10 au , they will still be high enough to preclude runaway growth ; therefore , even if planetesimals are able to accrete , they will do so at a slower rate than that traditionally assumed in single - star environments .",
    "alternatively , in - situ formation at the inferred collision speeds could be possible if we allowed for rapid formation of planetesimals at least 100 - 300 km ( depending on the material strength of the planetesimals ) in size , according to the destruction criterion of @xcite .",
    "such large planetesimals would be essentially indestructible and accrete in spite of the large impact velocities .",
    "recent planetesimal formation theories actually seem to favor the direct formation of massive bound clumps ( between a fraction to several times the mass of ceres ) through the streaming instability @xcite , lending credence to the latter scenario .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the results of the numerical simulations of the streaming instability are applicable to the circumbinary context .",
    "firstly , the instability is modeled numerically within a corotating shearing box , which is assumed to be representative of the disk .",
    "this approximation is manifestly inaccurate in the binary environment , which is subject to time - dependent perturbations from the central binary ( which in turn will excite non - axisymmetric , time - dependent perturbations in the gas disk ) .",
    "therefore , it might be premature to expect that this mechanism can operate in the same manner within the circumbinary environment .",
    "secondly , meter - sized boulders ( the building blocks that concentrate and gravitationally collapse in overdense regions ) are expected to collide at very high speeds and fragment due to the binary perturbations ( regardless of the amplitude of stochastic turbulent torques , which is the main limiting factor in the aforementioned simulations ) . finally , although direct formation of large planetesimals appears to be bolstered by the properties of the asteroids census in the solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , other authors disagree ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is fair to state that at present , there is no consensus on how planetesimals form is in the circumbinary environment , including an appropriate initial size spectrum .",
    "although the results of @xcite appear to preclude in - situ planet formation from km - sized planetesimal , their simulations have a number of limitations ( chiefly due to the high computational requirements of their approach ) .",
    "the simulations only spanned a limited time interval ( @xmath6 years ) , and did not allow for planetesimal accretion and fragmentation .",
    "therefore , they were restricted to measuring impact speeds and deeming the disk inside 10 au accretion - unfriendly .",
    "the evolution of the planetesimal size spectrum , in particular , can change the boundary of the accretion - friendly zone , as shown by @xcite ( hereafter p12 ) .",
    "in particular , if a fraction of planetesimals could survive collisional grinding and acquire an alternative pathway to growing large enough to become indestructible ( @xmath7 km ) , then planet formation could proceed even at the significant impact speeds found close to the central binary .    radial drift could be potentially helpful to this goal .",
    "solid objects in keplerian orbits will lose angular momentum due to the aerodynamic drag acceleration @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the gas and plantesimal density , respectively , @xmath11 is the local sound speed and @xmath12 is the relative velocity between the gas streamline and the planetesimal .",
    "the specific form of the function @xmath13 ( i.e. whether the epstein or quadratic regime is appropriate ) will depend on the radius of the body @xmath14 .",
    "the gas speed is given by @xmath15 \\",

    "the second equality holds for a disk with constant aspect ratio @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the local scale height ) and an isothermal equation of state @xmath24 . for typical surface density profiles",
    "( with @xmath25 ) , the gas speed is lower than the local keplerian speed , resulting in the solid body experiencing a headwind and spiraling inwards . while the surface density gradient can be assumed to be negative in single stars environments ( until very close to the central star ) , the presence of a central binary will truncate the disk starting at a specific radius ( @xmath26 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a density gradient inversion and a local pressure maximum . at this locus",
    ", solid bodies could be `` trapped '' , since the drag force will change sign across the pressure maximum ( vanishing at the pressure maximum ) .",
    "therefore , solids will tend to accumulate at the boundary between super - keplerian / sub - keplerian gas speeds , as seen in numerical simulations that include a non - uniform pressure profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this trapping was also observed by @xcite , who remarked that , in their simulations , small bodies ( 100 m in size ) concentrated in the inner regions of the disk surrounding a binary star .",
    "planetesimals are also liable to accumulating in the same region , although on a much longer timescale than meter - sized debris . the drifting speeds for a swarm of km - sized planetesimals in low - eccentricity orbits embedded in an axisymmetric disk ( the typical situation in single - star environments ) are typically very low ( of order @xmath27",
    " @xmath28 au / yr , depending on the planetesimal location ) .",
    "however , in the setup considered in this paper the central binary will force a large eccentricity on the planetesimals , such that the velocity differential @xmath29 is increased , enhancing drift speeds by an order of magnitude or more ( as we will show in section [ sec : drift ] ) .",
    "this implies that planetesimal drift could be significant on the timescales relevant to planet formation .",
    "in particular , any planetesimals that survive grinding will migrate and stop at the trapping locus .",
    "the radial drift of debris and planetesimals suggests an alternative to the migration of the planetary core scenario . assuming that planetesimals are formed rapidly throughout the disk , then the following sequence creates an accretion - friendly planetesimal belt in the inner disk where lucky `` survivors '' might thrive and grow :    1 .",
    "a majority of planetesimals undergo rapid grinding throughout the disk , creating a large amount of small debris ( `` dust '' ) .",
    "the dust created by planetesimal grinding quickly drifts into the pressure maximum , and persists there ( it can not drift further in due to the combined action of the aerodynamic drag and the angular momentum barrier ) .",
    "planetesimal grinding continues until collision timescales become longer than drift timescales .",
    "planetesimals that survived fragmentation can therefore migrate and stop into the debris belt .",
    "4 .   within the belt , planetesimals can grow by sweeping up dust ( a localized version of the  snowball model  of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the ongoing accumulation of debris within the belt ,",
    "then planetesimals might quickly become large enough to be indestructible .",
    "these bodies may become `` seeds '' for runaway growth and start accreting other planetesimals , ultimately accumulating into a single planetary core .",
    "further planetesimal drift extend the feeding zone of the core .",
    "we sketch this process in figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "although this scenario might seem plausible at face value , the arguments presented so far still represent a substantial simplification of the complex physical setup .",
    "indeed , both the gas disk and the swarm of planetesimals will develop significant eccentricity and precession due to the gravitational perturbations of the central binary .",
    "therefore , it is not immediately clear that planetesimals and debris could reside in a well - confined belt , as hypothesized above .",
    "this paper attempts to ascertain whether the `` destruction - drift - reaccumulation '' process sketched above can be physically feasible in a realistic circumbinary environment .",
    "we developed a numerical approach that , despite numerous simplifications , strives to model the various physical processes at work for the long timescales involved ( up to about @xmath1 years ) as faithfully as possible .",
    "we discuss our code and planetesimal dynamics in section [ sec : drift ] . in section [ sec : results ] , we build from the results of section [ sec : drift ] and create a toy model that follows planetesimals growth in the belt . finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "to validate the scenario proposed in the introduction , we first need to verify that planetesimals will halt their migration close to the pressure maximum .",
    "this will require a more sophisticated approach than that employed in m12 , which assumed an axisymmetric and static gas background .",
    "on the other hand , given that we aim to model planetesimal dynamics for long timescales , the self - consistent simulations of @xcite would be exceedingly expensive .",
    "therefore , we decided to take a hybrid approach , whereby we first run high - resolution , two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for @xmath30 years .",
    "we then evaluate the output of the simulations in order to derive a highly simplified model of the gas dynamics .",
    "this model allows us to provide a more realistic approximation for the aerodynamic drag and a gravitational term arising from the disk , coupled with our @xmath0-body code .",
    "as shown below , an eccentric , rigidly precessing disk is a reasonable ( if crude ) approximation to the full hydrodynamical output .",
    "finally , we run our @xmath0-body code fitted with the gas model to verify whether planetesimals are trapped close to the truncation radius .",
    "+   +    we ran a host of two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using the isothermal fargo code @xcite .",
    "we modified the code to work in barycentric coordinates .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we consider the binary parameters of the kepler-16 system ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 days , @xmath34 ) for easy comparison with previous works .",
    "the keplerian orbital elements of the binary are fixed .",
    "we employ a simple thin disk model as our initial configuration .",
    "we assume a disk with surface density @xmath35 ( with the same normalization as the minimum - mass solar nebula ; * ? ? ? * ) and constant aspect ratio @xmath36 ; the disk is initially circular .",
    "the disk is modeled by a grid with @xmath37 512 azimuthal divisions and @xmath38 384 radial divisions ( with an arithmetic spacing ) .",
    "the radial direction covers between 0.4 au and 10 au and ends with an open boundary on either side of the grid .",
    "we added an exponential taper to the surface density close to the inner and outer boundary .",
    "this setup is similar to that of @xcite , although we take a different slope for the surface density and we neglect the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "finally , we assume a constant kinematic viscosity for the disk ( @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 at 5 au ) .    we evolve our disk model for 10,000 years ( more than @xmath1 binary orbits ) .",
    "the disk very quickly opens an inner cavity ( within a few tens of binary orbits ) .",
    "after an initial period of activity near the cavity , the surface density evolves very little throughout the simulation , except for a slow expansion of the inner cavity ( with the surface density maximum moving outwards , as expected for a viscous external disk ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the evolution surface density is shown in the top panels of figure [ fig : hydro ] .",
    "subsequently , we calculated the semi - major axis of each cell and averaged the eccentricity in each semi - major axis bin ( figure [ fig : hydro ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the eccentricity is calculated from the velocity components of each grid cell .",
    "the eccentricity peaks close to the inner cavity and rapidly declines , such that the outer disk ( outside @xmath41 au ) has negligible eccentricity .",
    "we find this situation to be qualitatively similar to the results of @xcite , but quite different from the results of @xcite .",
    "the latter simulations included more realistic disk thermodynamics than our simple isothermal assumption .",
    "the simulation was run at a higher resolution as well ( with @xmath42 and @xmath43 grid points ) in order to investigate the sensitivity of the numerical results to the grid resolution .",
    "we found that the output of our higher - resolution runs are consistent with our standard - resolution runs , aside from small differences in the disk eccentricity and surface density close to the inner edge ( figure [ fig : hydro ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : hydro_byr ] shows the eccentricity and longitude of periastron evaluated at a few select radii . although the eccentricity has an average value that is approximately constant throughout the simulation , there are substantial periodic oscillations .",
    "the inner disk ( inside @xmath41 au ) appears to be librating with a very large amplitude and a period of about 1,000 binary orbits ( almost to the point of rigid precession ) , whereas the outer disk appears to be librating around @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the eccentricity thus found is derived assuming a keplerian potential around a body placed in the center of mass of the binary with mass @xmath45 ( i.e. , such that the potential is @xmath46 ) .",
    "this might add a substantial eccentricity in the initial conditions of the disk , due to the fact that the azimuthal velocity of the fluid cells are started at a lower speed than a circular orbit in the true axisymmetric potential @xcite .",
    "the fictitious eccentricity does not modify the overall dynamics , as the orbital elements of the disk influence the planetesimal dynamics through equation [ eqn : drag ] only ; this means that the orbital elements are converted back into a physical velocity vector at each location within the disk ( i.e. , the orbital elements are just a convenient intermediate representation ) .",
    "however , it does imply that the disk is not initialized in a `` true '' circular state .",
    "for the specific case of the kepler-16 system , the fictitious eccentricity should be of the order of @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 expressed in au , using formula 26 of @xcite ) .",
    "ideally , we would like to follow planetesimal drift self - consistently by coupling test particles ( planetesimals ) to the hydrodynamical evolution of the disk .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , this approach is prohibitively expensive since , despite the comparatively rapid drift experienced in the inner 2 au of the disk , the relevant timescales are much longer than those modeled above ( up to a factor of 100 ) .",
    "therefore , it is desirable , if not entirely self - consistent , to model the gas evolution in an approximate fashion , such that the evolution of a large population of planetesimals can be followed for at least @xmath49 years .",
    "we follow the spirit of the formulation of @xcite by assuming that the gas disk can be represented as an eccentric , rigidly precessing disk .",
    "we assume that each hydrodynamical quantity @xmath50 ( i.e. surface density , sound speed and scale height ) is constant on each eccentric streamline @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 $ ] , where @xmath53 is the gas semi - major axis , @xmath54 is the gas eccentricity and @xmath55 is the longitude of periastron . the eccentricity at each semi - major axis is assumed constant for the duration of the simulation ( figure [ fig : hydro ] ) , while the longitude of pericenter is assumed to be precessing with a constant period @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 ( although the outer disk is librating in our simulation , the eccentricity there is small enough to have a negligible effect on the planetesimal dynamics ) .",
    "finally , we assume that the gas speed at each eccentric streamline is given by @xmath58 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 ( as in equation [ eqn : gasspeed ] ) and @xmath60 is the keplerian orbital speed along the streamline .",
    "therefore , in our model the speed differential is determined by the local surface density gradient ( as opposed to being constant , an assumption of the simplified model of * ? ? ?",
    "the disk model is then completed by specifying a surface density profile @xmath61 , an eccentricity profile @xmath62 and the precession period @xmath63 .    once the model is specified as above , we bin the hydrodynamical quantities over a 2d grid ( with 512 radial and 512 azimuthal zones ) for computational convenience .",
    "this step allows us to efficiently compute hydrodynamical quantities local to the planetesimal , and optionally , the gas potential .",
    "planetesimals are represented as a swarm of non - interacting test particles , subject to the sum of the gravitational force of the binary system , the aerodynamic drag and the gas potential .",
    "the aerodynamic drag is given by equation [ eqn : drag ] , with @xmath13 taking the following form in the quadratic regime : @xmath64 ( where the coefficient @xmath65 for spherical bodies ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical quantities ( @xmath66 ) are efficiently interpolated at the planetesimal location ( using bilinear interpolation ) .",
    "the planetesimal orbits are evolved forward in time using the code @xcite , which employs an 8-th order runge - kutta integration scheme .",
    "the model described above makes a number of approximations for the sake of computational expediency .",
    "the most important limitation is the choice of an isothermal equation of state for our hydrodynamical simulations , which appears to effect the gas dynamics .",
    "@xcite finds that adding a realistic energy equation to the hydrodynamical model results in a much more active disk , such that the eccentricity profile and potential change rapidly as a function of time .",
    "taking these effects into account in our model may be difficult .",
    "however , it is possible that these time - dependent variations might be transient and become less important over longer timescales .",
    "our model assumes that the local hydrodynamical properties of the disk can be usefully represented by assuming they are constant over an eccentric streamline .",
    "this assumption simplifies an inherently two - dimensional problem ( the evolution of a hydrodynamical quantity @xmath67 $ ] ) into a one - dimensional problem ( @xmath68 $ ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite showed that this approximation is unwarranted if the disk eccentricity varies as a function of semi - major axis ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is exactly the case in our hydrodynamical simulation ( see the bottom panel of figure [ fig : hydro ] ) . at a given semi - major axis ,",
    "there is substantial scatter in @xmath18 and other quantities , especially close to the central binary ( i.e. @xmath70 au ) where the perturbations are strongest .",
    "therefore , the one - dimensional approximation presented in this section ( and further developed into a model in section [ sec : evolving ] and [ sec : results ] ) is not strictly correct .    we will summarize a number of caveats related to our simplified treatment of the background gas disk in section [ sec : caveats ] .",
    "we first show planetesimal drift as computed assuming the fixed , axisymmetric gas background of m12 .",
    "figure [ fig : drift ] shows the planetesimal drift ( semi - major axis as a function of time ) for planetesimals with radius @xmath71 km .",
    "the planetesimal disk inside @xmath72 au is depleted within @xmath49 years .",
    "the drift speed is larger than that expected in single - star systems , due to the large eccentricity excited in the planetesimal disk @xcite .",
    "planetesimals do not migrate all the way to the instability limit @xcite , however .",
    "the presence of the central binary dictates that as they migrate inwards , they are liable to being captured in a resonance with the stars ( analogously to the resonant capture of migrating planets ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in our case , the semi - major axis is fixed ; therefore , planetesimals will converge to a fixed location .",
    "for the set of parameters considered in this paper , planetesimals are captured just outside the 5:1 resonance ( where the planet also resides ; * ? ? ?",
    "to investigate planetesimal evolution within a more realistic gas background , we subsequently ran a simplified model where the surface density profile is fixed to that derived from the hydrodynamical snapshot at @xmath73 years ( i.e. ignoring any further viscous evolution of the disk for the duration of the simulation ) .",
    "while this is approximation is unwarranted ( given that significant viscous evolution is bound to happen over the time range explored below ) , it speeds up our code , since the gridding procedure can be run once at the beginning of the simulation ( every hydrodynamical quantity is constant ) . to compute the hydrodynamical quantities precessed by @xmath74",
    ", we simply rotate the azimuthal angle accordingly .    for the fixed surface density model , we additionally take the gas disk potential @xmath75 into account .",
    "@xcite showed that including the disk potential can raise the eccentricity of the planetesimals , potentially increasing the drift speed .",
    "the disk potential is calculated by direct summation once at the beginning of the simulation , and then rotated according to the precession frequency .",
    "figure [ fig : vr ] shows the drift speed of 2.5-km planetesimals , with and without the gas potential .",
    "the drift speed is increased by a factor of 2 compared to the axisymmetric , static background .",
    "this increase in drift speed for eccentric , precessing disks was anticipated in the analytic models of @xcite .",
    "for the model including the gas potential , there is a spike in drift speed between approximately 2 and 3 au ; this is due to an enhanced planetesimal eccentricity in that region ( see figure [ fig : ecc_lop ] ) .",
    "this region of eccentricity excitation is a secular resonance located where the secular precession amplitude @xmath76 equals the planetesimal precession @xmath77 induced by the gravity of the gas disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* note that we do not take the binary precession term @xmath78 into account ) .",
    "evaluating the the secular equations of @xcite with the parameters of our simulations yields a location for the resonance @xmath79 au , which is approximately consistent with figure [ fig : ecc_lop ] .",
    "the increase in eccentricity was also observed in @xcite . in this narrow region , planetesimals are rapidly depleted .",
    "the drift speed decreases steeply ( and actually changes sign ) at @xmath80 au ( @xmath81 ) , very close to the current observed location of the planet .",
    "this semi - major axis is close to the location of the pressure maximum ( @xmath82 au ) .",
    "we expected that @xmath83 and @xmath84 would not precisely coincide , since equation [ eqn : gasspeed ] is derived in an axisymmetric approximation ( neglecting the eccentricity of the planetesimals and the gas , and the time - dependent potential of the central binary ) .",
    "we observe that planetesimals appear to smoothly halt at @xmath83 , and once they reached that radius , they show little semi - major axis variation ( figure [ fig : drift ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "+   +    as mentioned at the beginning of the previous subsection , ignoring the viscous evolution of the disk is an unwarranted simplification , since the viscous timescale @xmath85 years at 2 au .",
    "therefore , we need a recipe for evolving @xmath61 as a function of time .",
    "we model the surface density of the disk with the usual viscous evolution equations @xcite , with the addition of an angular momentum source term representing the binary torque @xcite .",
    "again , we effectively assume in our formulation that the surface density is approximately constant on each eccentric streamline ( labeled by @xmath86 ) , rather than on a circular radius @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , for the sake of the simplified model presented in this paper , we write the one - dimensional evolution equations as : @xmath88^{1/2}}\\right ] \\ .\\label{eqn : onedev}\\ ] ] the term @xmath89 represents the torque exerted by the central binary and is written as @xcite : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the binary mass ratio .",
    "the surface density profile predicted by equation [ eqn : onedev ] generates surface density profiles that are more depleted at small radii ( @xmath92 au ) than the one derived from the hydrodynamical simulation at equal times .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the torque prescribed by equation [ eqn : torque ] does not allow any accretion on the disk and quickly pushes material in the inner disk outwards , while in our full hydrodynamical simulations material continues to accrete onto the binary via non - axisymmetric streams .",
    "we set the dimensionless parameter @xmath93 to match the density profiles generated by equation [ eqn : onedev ] with the outputs of our fargo runs ( section [ sec : fargo ] ) . while not a perfect match , it is adequate for the order - of - magnitude model presented in this paper .",
    "the viscous evolution dictated by equation [ eqn : onedev ] quickly reduces the gas surface density during the first few @xmath30 years ; correspondingly , drift speeds are also reduced .",
    "we therefore consider a more massive disk ( 2 times the standard mmsn normalization of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that drift speeds are comparable to those observed in the previous section .    we couple this 1d model to the code , and update @xmath61 ( and , therefore , @xmath29 ) at each time - step .",
    "we neglect the gas potential ( which would also need to be recalculated at each time - step ) to ease the computational burden .",
    "the previous section showed that the main consequence of including the gas potential was to speed up drift between 2 and 3 au , while drift speed was essentially the same elsewhere in the disk .",
    "the planetesimal drift in this model is shown in figure [ fig : drift_ev ] .",
    "drift speeds are comparable to those observed in the previous section .",
    "planetesimals in the outer disk drift inwards and tend to converge to the trap at @xmath94 au .",
    "planetesimals with initial semi - major axes inside the trap rapidly drift outwards , with a speed that increases sharply at small radii ( due to the steep decrease in surface density , which results in a steep positive pressure gradient ) .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : tr_ecc_lop ] shows the distribution of semi - major axes of planetesimals throughout a simulation .",
    "as noted in the previous section , planetesimals that are captured in the belt tend to be confined to a narrow range in semi - major axis ( @xmath95 au ) .",
    "we note that trapped planetesimals occupy a well - defined locus in eccentricity and longitude of pericenter as well .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : tr_ecc_lop ] shows a snapshot of the simulation ( @xmath96 years ) where planetesimals in the belt are confined to @xmath97,\\ { \\varpi}- { \\varpi}_b \\in [ -15^\\circ , 15^\\circ]$ ] ( i.e. aligned with the central binary ) .",
    "in section [ sec : drift ] , we verified that km - sized planetesimals in a circumbinary disk will tend to drift inwards , until they encounter a pressure maximum . at the pressure maximum , the aerodynamic drag vanishes ; therefore , solids tend to be stranded in a well - confined `` belt '' ( close to 1 au for the nominal set of disk parameters ) .",
    "smaller debris ( `` dust '' ) produced by planetesimal - planetesimal destructive collisions will also tend to converge to the same region .",
    "therefore , surviving planetesimals that drift into the belt will find themselves in a solid - rich region . assuming that the efficiency of accreting dust is high",
    ", planetesimals could conceivably accrete mass from the debris reservoir to become indestructible ( @xmath98 km ) and subsequently form the building blocks of a planetary core .",
    "the crux is now establishing that this process is quick enough to produce a core within a reasonable time scale .",
    "a rigorous approach to the problem at hand would involve tracking planetesimal destruction and dust accretion self - consistently in the manner of @xcite and p12 . in their simulations , the cascade of fragments produced by collisions is followed down to a certain size , where it is deemed as `` dust '' .",
    "the numerical model of p12 has a number of downsides .",
    "firstly , it is assumed that there is no pressure gradient in the static background disk ( an ad - hoc assumption to simplify the model ) ; therefore , in their simulations planetesimals and dust do _ not _ drift .",
    "secondly , dust produced by the planetesimal collisions is accumulated in - place into circular radial bins .",
    "rather , we should expect dust ( which is strongly coupled to the gas through aerodynamic drag ) to settle into the eccentric streamlines followed by the gas disk .",

    "we take the nominal value of @xmath167 g @xmath105 ( the solid surface density normalization ) and consider three different values for @xmath106 ( the thickness of the dust disk relative to the gas disk , a proxy for the amount of turbulence in the disk ) : strong ( @xmath168 ) , intermediate ( @xmath169 ) and weak ( @xmath170 ) turbulence , following @xcite .",
    "the strong turbulence value is the least favorable to planetesimal growth , since it limits the rate at which planetesimals can accrete dust .",
    "we plot the size evolution for strong and weak planetesimals ; we expect the size evolution of a realistic planetesimal population to reside between the two extremes .",
    "initially , planetesimals in the belt grow exclusively by accreting dust .",
    "dust accretion in our model is relatively fast , since the dust annulus is fed by planetesimal grinding throughout the disk , leading to high dust surface densities .",
    "still , the median size of planetesimals grows slowly ( middle panel of figure [ fig : rpl ] ) .",
    "this is the result of the competition between dust accretion ( which increases the radius only linearly ; equation [ eqn : radev ] ) , the continual grinding by mutual collisions and the drifting of new 5-km planetesimals drifting in from the outer disk . on the other hand",
    ", a fraction of `` lucky '' planetesimals that suffer fewer collisions can continue growing to larger sizes , creating a size spectrum in the belt .",
    "bodies residing in the tail of the size spectrum ( the seeds ) become large enough that a significant fraction of the possible impact speeds results in accretion rather than destruction .",
    "this opens a new growth channel that is not available to the sea of small planetesimals in the belt .",
    "therefore , the indestructible seeds start growing at a much faster rate than the background planetesimals , and can very rapidly reach the runaway growth stage .",
    "the timescale for reaching the critical size is determined primarily by @xmath106 , spanning from just @xmath171 years ( @xmath170 ) to @xmath172 years ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath106 sets the dust accretion rate , and consequently the time it takes for bodies to reach the indestructible size .",
    "the material strength also plays a role : strong seeds are able to start accreting other planetesimals at a smaller size than their weak counterparts , reaching the critical size earlier .",
    "finally , the bottom panel of figure [ fig : rpl ] shows a snapshot of the size distribution of planetesimals at the end of each simulation .",
    "we note that , again , the size distribution is primarily set by @xmath106 : faster accretion rates imply that planetesimals are able to leave the 5-km size bin rapidly and become less susceptible to destructive encounters .",
    "consequently , the size distribution becomes steeper as the turbulence parameter @xmath106 is increased .",
    "we also considered three different normalizations for the initial solid surface density ( 5 , 10 , and 20 g @xmath105 ) , where 10 g @xmath105 is our nominal mmsn value .",
    "the larger normalization reflects the likely possibility that the primordial solid inventory in an mmsn - like nebula was larger ( by a factor of 2 - 3 ) , but lost due to inefficiencies in the planet formation process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the smaller normalization takes into account the possibility of a less solid - rich nebula ; this normalization could be appropriate for the sub - solar metallicity of kepler-16 ( [ fe / h @xmath173 ) .",
    "we plot the growth curves in the top panel of figure [ fig : rplsigma ] , where we took @xmath169 ( corresponding to an intermediate turbulence level ) .",
    "as expected , a larger initial surface density results in a faster growth , due both to the higher surface density of the dust annulus and the larger number of planetesimals available to accrete .",
    "similarly , in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : rplsigma ] we considered three different normalizations for the radial extent of the dust annulus @xmath174 ; higher values of @xmath108 reduce the surface density of dust @xmath175 , and therefore slow down the initial accretion of dust by the planetesimals .",
    "we note that the dust accretion rate determines the timescale for the onset of planetesimal accretion ( and the subsequent runaway phase ) .",
    "the dust accretion rate depends on the ratio of @xmath175 and @xmath106 ( equation [ eqn : radev ] ) , and @xmath176 itself depends on @xmath108 ( equation [ eqn : dust ] ) .",
    "consequently , the timescale is strongly degenerate with respect to the initial surface density in planetesimals ( @xmath104 ) , the level of turbulence ( @xmath106 ) and the radial concentration of the dust ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "even a less massive planetesimal disk could produce indestructible seeds if the level of turbulence is correspondingly reduced or the radial concentration of the dust is increased .",
    "however , the final mass of the core will still ultimately be determined by @xmath104 ( which sets the _",
    "total _ mass in solids available to be accreted ) .",
    "in - situ formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have recently become _ en vogue _ , bolstered by the discovery of the large , close - in kepler exoplanets and the ostensible inability of population synthesis models to reproduce the planets observed properties . in the same spirit , we presented here a model that side - steps the km - size bottleneck in circumbinary configurations , allowing planetesimal accretion to proceed near a pressure trap .",
    "we identified a potential trap imposed by the density gradient inversion near the central binary , and postulated that solid bodies will tend to drift in and stop at that radius .",
    "we then sketched a possible scenario that takes into consideration planetesimal grinding , drift and reaccumulation .",
    "we validated this scenario using a combination of 2d hydrodynamical and n - body simulations .",
    "we first showed that radial drift can be very fast for both small debris and km - sized planetesimals , and the pressure structure in the disk tends to accumulate both close to the central binary .",
    "subsequently , we modeled the destruction - drift - reaccumulation process using a simplified numerical scheme , informed by our numerical simulations where possible . within this model , we showed that if a population of primordial km - sized planetesimals is formed throughout the disk , a large fraction will be destroyed , the resulting debris accumulating close to the pressure trap .",
    "surviving planetesimals will also drift into the trap , finding a solid - rich environment .",
    "a few seeds will grow large enough to become indestructible , start to accrete other planetesimals in the belt and entering a runaway growth phase .",
    "our toy model does not describe the evolution of the system beyond this critical size , since the large seeds will start stirring the planetesimal belt and the velocity dispersion will no longer be set by the binary / disk system alone .",
    "a full @xmath0-body simulation will be warranted to proceed further .",
    "however , the largest seeds should end up consolidating into a single , small core , which can then accrete the rest of the solid inventory in the belt ( dust and planetesimals ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the entire solid content within 3 au is available for accretion by the planetary core .",
    "is there enough solid material to form a core matching the core masses inferred for the circumbinary kepler planets ?",
    "again , kepler-16 b represents the most stringest test among the observed circumbinary planets.the core of kepler-16 b is expect to contain 40 to 60 earth masses in heavy elements @xcite , despite the low metallicity of the central binary ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath177 ) . assuming the standard mmsn normalization ( 10 g @xmath105 ) , there are only about 3 earth masses in heavy elements between 1 and 3 au .",
    "however , for close - in kepler planets this normalization is likely underestimating the solid inventory . in particular",
    ", @xcite derived a `` minimum - mass extrasolar nebula '' ( mmen ) assuming the close - in kepler planets were formed in situ .",
    "the resulting normalization at 1 au is approximately 50 g @xmath105 .",
    "accounting for some inefficiency in the planet formation process , then there might be just enough mass in solids to form the core of kepler-16 b. this need for an enhanced normalization of the solid disk is common to all in - situ formation models @xcite .",
    "we also remark that our model , for a given set of binary orbital elements , predicts a range of radii for the pressure trap , where we expect the planet to form . for the kepler-16 binary parameters and nominal values for the disk parameters ,",
    "the distance of the trap from the central binary is close to the current observed locations of the planet . to explain any discrepancy between the observed location of the planet and the position of the trap ( @xmath178 au for kepler-16 in this paper )",
    ", we can simply deviate from the nominal scale height normalization @xmath21 considered in this paper and fine - tune it to match the two radii ( equation [ eqn : drag ] ) .",
    "another possibility is to change the @xmath179 parameter that determines the viscosity of the disk .",
    "the option of fine - tuning the radial location of the trap by varying the physical parameters of the disk slightly diminishes the determinism inherent to our model , so that we can not uniquely predict ( or postdict ) the location of the planet given the binary parameters .",
    "unfortunately , models in which the core formed far out and subsequently migrated in can also make analogous predictions , provided that @xmath21 and @xmath179 are appropriately adjusted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is due to the fact that migrating cores will also stall close to the truncation edge @xcite .",
    "the current scenario for circumbinary planet formation ( formation of the core far from the binary , with subsequent migration ) remains the most likely explanation for the origin of kepler-16 b and the other circumbinary planets .",
    "its main requirement is the existence of a migration mechanism ( type - i migration ) which we _ already _ know is at work within protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has shaped the planetary census .",
    "on the other hand , the alternative scenario presented in this paper makes a number of requirements ( primarily , the existence of a primordial population of planetesimals to grind and the capture of both debris and lucky planetesimals close to the binary ) in order to achieve the outcome of planet formation . an improved simulation addressing the crude simplifications and caveats listed in the next section",
    "will help shed light on the viability of the model .",
    "as mentioned throughout the paper , our approach required a number of simplifying assumptions in order to attempt to capture the physical processes at work within the computational constraints .",
    "not all of these assumptions are fully self - consistent , but were chosen for the sake of simplicity and to allow the modeling of the system over @xmath1 years . in this respect ,",
    "given the crude approximations mentioned in section [ sec : results ] , the scheme for planetesimal evolution presented here should be considered an `` order of magnitude '' approach to modeling the coupled evolution of the disk , destruction , drift and debris accretion on stalled planetesimals .",
    "this mainly allows us to derive a range of plausible timescales over which this process can be at work to produce a core .",
    "only a more sophisticated treatment will verify whether some ( or all ) of the approximations detailed throughout the paper significantly alter , or even completely inhibit , the process described here .",
    "an @xmath0-body approach in the manner of p12 would lift some of the limitations of our model , while being able to model the collisional dynamics far more accurately .",
    "such an improved simulation should try to address the following issues :    _ planetesimal and debris sizes . _",
    "the limitation of a single - sized initial population is dictated by numerical convenience .",
    "indeed , if we were to allow for a spectrum of sizes throughout the disk , then the numerical scheme would need to track planetesimal size evolution everywhere and lose much of its simplicity .",
    "similarly , we do not follow the debris evolution in a detailed manner , but rather we lump them regardless of their size and categorize it as `` dust '' and assume it is instantaneously shepherded into the pressure maximum .",
    "we will lift this limitation in a future work ( at the expense of increased computational burden ) .    as mentioned in section [ sec : dustaccr ] , we calculate @xmath131 ( the dust accretion efficiency ) by averaging over the possible encounter speeds @xmath132 between the planetesimals and the dust , assuming that @xmath135 if @xmath180 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the bulk of the encounter speed arises from the mismatch between the gas eccentricity and the planetesimal eccentricity . for the small planetesimal size considered here ( 5 km ) , initially @xmath181 , meaning that a majority of encounters would happen at high speeds ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "our averaging implicitly assumes that such high - speed collisions do _ not _ affect the target planetesimals ( i.e. the dust flows around the planetesimal , or bounces without cratering ) .",
    "this is potentially the most problematic of the assumptions implicit in our model , considering that the high - speed collisions might `` sandblast '' the planetesimal instead .",
    "we note that only a detailed treatment of the accretion of dust of different sizes on the planetesimal ( considering the balance between cratering and accretion ) can give a more definite value for @xmath131 . only for bigger planetesimals ( @xmath183 km )",
    "the escape velocity is large enough that @xmath109 is always equal to 1 ( @xmath132 is always less than @xmath184 .",
    "we also note that we measured @xmath123 ( the planetesimal collision speed throughout the disk , which determines the balance between the amount of dust produced and the number of planetesimals that survive long enough to drift into the belt ) and @xmath185 from an evolved distribution of planetesimals , so that any initial transients due to eccentricity oscillations have evolved towards an equilibrium profile .",
    "this essentially implies that the planetesimals would be born with the equilibrium orbital elements `` ab initio '' .",
    "_ disk eccentricity and high-@xmath186 , non - axisymmetric perturbations . _ for simplicity , we chose to neglect the non - axisymmetric perturbations from the disk beyond the simple bulk disk eccentricity .",
    "these time - dependent perturbations could potentially disturb the formation of the planetesimal and dust rings .",
    "however , we remark that in our hydrodynamical simulation the amplitude of the @xmath187 modes is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the eccentric mode at 1 au .    as noted in section [ sec : model_setup ] , the assumption that each hydrodynamical quantity is constant along eccentric streamlines is strictly inconsistent with a non - constant disk eccentricity @xcite .",
    "indeed , we find that throughout the hydrodynamical runs , there is substantial scatter of @xmath18 at each semi - major axis .",
    "this issue is especially problematic close to 1 au , where it is crucial to correctly model the dynamics of planetesimals in order to ascertain that planetesimals are captured close to the pressure maximum .",

    ", this means that both the disk and the planetesimals are initialized with some initial eccentricity , potentially increasing both drift speeds and collision speeds . while this effect should be small compared to the eccentricities excited by the central binary , we will ascertain the impact of changing the initial conditions in a future @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "_ disk potential and self - gravity .",
    "_ @xcite also showed that including the contribution of the disk potential can have profound effects on both the planetesimal and binary dynamics .",

    "this effect could potentially affect our results as well , since @xcite argues that fast binary precession could suppress the development of eccentricity in the disk .",
