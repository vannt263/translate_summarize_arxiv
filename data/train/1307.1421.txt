    "experimentally , since the maximal n2/n1 ratio is @xmath158 , we have not been able to reach this critical value .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the dos behavior near the lower edge is presented in appendix  [ app : numerics ] .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the propagation of microwaves in an array of dielectric resonators is well described by a tight - binding model , allowing the realization of `` artificial graphene , '' where the microwaves play the role of the electrons in graphene . by changing the distance between resonators ,",
    "we have experimentally studied the role of higher order coupling terms in the frame of the tb regime .",
    "we observe a clear modification of the density of states , with a dissymmetry of the spectrum and a shift of the energy of the dirac points .",
    "meanwhile , the major characteristics of the dos  two bands touching at a ( dirac ) point with a vanishing dos , two logarithmic divergences  as well as the overall structure of the eigenstates are preserved .",
    "this complete characterization of the `` artificial microwave graphene '' may open the way to new experiments in order to easily simulate the fascinating properties of graphene and related systems exhibiting dirac cones .",
    "_ breit - wigner expression._the frequency range used in the experiment being of the order of or less than @xmath159mhz , the coupling to the antenna @xmath43 may be assumed to be nearly constant.@xcite thus , the reflection reads ( @xmath160 being the position of the antenna connected to the port 1 of the network analyzer ) @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the regularized green s function : @xmath163 the green s function is the resolvent of the tight - binding hamiltonian : @xmath164 where @xmath165 . + by introducing the eigenfunctions @xmath166 and the eigenvalues @xmath167 of @xmath115 , expression ( [ s11 ] )",
    "can be recast in a breit - wigner - form , for isolated resonances : @xmath168 one can legitimately assume that the width @xmath44 corresponds to _ homogeneous _ damping . indeed ,",
    "since the damping is essentially due to the ohmic losses in the bottom and top metallic plates sandwiching the dielectric resonators , a constant and uniform decay rate for all the eigenmodes ( @xmath169 ) is expected.@xcite the local density of states is given by : @xmath170    _ isolated resonance._for an isolated resonance , the sum in ( [ bw ] ) contains only one term @xmath171 thus , the amplitude of the reflected signal  the network analyzer does not fix an absolute phase reference  can be related to the intensity of the wave function [ neglecting the @xmath172 term ] : @xmath173 close to the eigenfrequency @xmath19 , one has @xmath174    _",
    "@xmath75 function._one defines the `` @xmath75 function '' by @xmath175 where @xmath176 indicates an averaging over the whole range of the frequency spectra , @xmath177 is the phase of the reflected signal : @xmath178 , and where @xmath179 denotes its derivative with respect to the frequency . to avoid non physical singularities in the derivative due to the modulo-@xmath180 occurring in the @xmath181 function , we use the following expression of @xmath179 : @xmath182 in the regime of non overlapping resonances , this quantity takes non zero values only in the vicinity of the eigenfrequencies .",
    "close to a given eigenfrequency , the real and imaginary part of @xmath183 @xmath184 exhibit the following dominant behaviors ( @xmath185 ) : @xmath186 it follows that @xmath187 and @xmath188 having in mind that @xmath44 , the resonance width , gives the frequency resolution , the quantity @xmath189 can be viewed as a discrete version of the delta function @xmath190 .",
    "thus , we obtain through the @xmath75-function an approximated evaluation of the density of states : @xmath191 we get @xmath192 by taking @xmath193 for each position @xmath160 .",

    ", a divergence of the dos appears at the lower edge of the spectrum .",
    "the reason is the following : near the lower edge of the spectrum , that is around @xmath201 , we have @xmath202 with @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",

    "[ fig : dosnob ] ) .",
    "\\(i ) for @xmath208 , we have @xmath209 and @xmath210 . since @xmath211 , the dos is almost constant near the edge ( as expected for a quadratic dispersion relation in 2d ) , with a linear correction . @xmath212 the linear term becomes negative for @xmath213 ( i.e. , when @xmath214 and @xmath215 ) .",
