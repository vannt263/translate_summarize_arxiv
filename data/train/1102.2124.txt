    "@xmath3 is the unique bracketing of size 1 ,    \\2 .",
    "the bracketings of size @xmath0 are exactly the strings of form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are bracketings of size @xmath9 resp .",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath11 .    _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath12 is the only bracketing of size 2 , and @xmath13 is a bracketing of size 5 . note that we always use an outermost pair of parentheses whenever @xmath14 , in contrary to the everyday usage of parentheses .",
    "we shall denote bracketings by capital letters , and @xmath15 stands for the size of @xmath16 .",
    "bracketings are , in fact , the elements of the free groupoid with one free generator @xmath3 ( _ cf . _",
    "[ 1 ] , p. 133 ) , or , equivalently , they are the unary groupoid terms .",
    "the corresponding unary term operations on special groupoids were investigated by several authors ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ [ 5,7 ] ) . in any bracketing of size",
    "@xmath0 we can indicate the position of symbols @xmath3 by subscripts @xmath17 , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath18 .",
    "thus , a bracketing of size @xmath0 provides also an element of the free groupoid with free generators @xmath19 , _",
    "i.e. _ , an @xmath0-ary groupoid term ( although , of course , not all @xmath0-ary groupoid terms originate from bracketings in such a way ) . here",
    "we always study bracketings considered as @xmath0-ary groupoid terms , even if in some cases we omit the subscripts @xmath17 . on every groupoid @xmath20 , these terms give rise to @xmath0-ary term operations .",
    "we call them _ regular _ @xmath0__-ary operations of _ _ @xmath20 ( or , _ regular over the operation of _",
    "@xmath20 ) , and , in concrete cases , _ operations induced by given bracketings_. for notation of the regular operation induced by the bracketing @xmath21 _ etc .",
    "_ we use the corresponding lowercase letters @xmath22 _ etc_.    if @xmath20 is associative , then by the generalized associative law there is exactly one regular @xmath0-ary operation for each @xmath0 . in the general case , we have a sequence @xmath23 of positive integers with @xmath24 denoting the number of distinct @xmath0-ary regular operations of @xmath20 . _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath25 for every groupoid @xmath20 , and @xmath26 if and only if @xmath20 is nonassociative , as then the two possible bracketings of size 3 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 induce different ternary term operations .    the sequence @xmath29 measures , in some sense , the distance of @xmath20 from associativity : the smaller its entries are , the closer the operation of @xmath20 is to being associative .",
    "hence we call this sequence _ the associative spectrum of _ @xmath20 ( or , _ of the operation of _",
    "@xmath20 ) . instead of @xmath24",
    "we write @xmath30 if this can not cause misunderstanding . usually we also omit @xmath31 and @xmath32 , bearing no information about @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    "we study the introduced notion from several points of view .",
    "the next section contains some well - known facts , simple observations , and auxiliary results on bracketings and associative spectra ; there and later , the routine inductive proofs will often be omitted .",
    "most frequently we use induction on size ; we leave out the words on size  in these cases .",
    "the third section contains samples of determining associative spectra of some familiar nonassociative operations .",
    "the problem of characterizing all associative spectra of operations on a set with a given power seems to be hard .",
    "however , the case of the two - element set is , as it might be expected , easy ( section 4 ) , and a lot of three - element groupoids are accessible ( section 5 ) . in the final section we present some facts on the general behavior of associative spectra , and formulate several problems .    further on , we write",
    "simply _ spectrum _ for associative spectrum .",
    "for any bracketing @xmath16 of size @xmath33 , we can _ pair _ its left and right parentheses in a natural way ( [ 9,15 ] ) .",
    "induction shows that we can always choose a consecutive quadruple @xmath12 in @xmath16 ; its left and right parentheses will be associated to form a pair . replacing then @xmath12 with @xmath3",
    "we obtain a bracketing @xmath34 of size @xmath4 , for which the preceding process can be repeated until no unpaired parentheses remain .",
    "this way of forming pairs involves that any pair together with the symbols between them is also a bracketing .",
    "it is called a _ subbracketing of _ @xmath16 ; _ e.g. _ , if @xmath35 , then @xmath7 and @xmath8 are subbracketings of @xmath16 , as outermost parentheses of any bracketing are paired .",
    "we call @xmath7 and @xmath8 the ( _ left _ resp . _ right _ ) _ factors _ of @xmath16 .",
    "the symbols @xmath3 are considered as subbracketings of size 1 , too . observe that pairing is unique , and if a parenthesis lies between a pair then its associate also lies between them .",
    "hence the representation of bracketings of size @xmath36 in form @xmath6 is unique , too .    substituting @xmath3 for one or several disjoint subbracketings in @xmath16 we obtain _ a quotient bracketing _ of @xmath16 . _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath37 and @xmath38 are ( disjoint ) subbracketings of @xmath39 , and replacing them with @xmath3 provides the quotient bracketing @xmath40 of @xmath16 .",
    "a bracketing is a _ nest _",
    "if it is either of size 1 ( _ a trivial nest _ ) or one out of its factors is @xmath3 , and the other one is a nest ( [ 5,7 ] ) .",
    "_ e.g. _ , all bracketings of size 4 save @xmath41 are nests .",
    "given a bracketing @xmath16 , there are subbracketings of @xmath16 which are nests ; in particular , each @xmath42 is contained in a unique maximal nest .",
    "we call these maximal nests simply _ the nests of _ @xmath16",
    ". a nontrivial nest has a unique subbracketing of form @xmath43 ; we say that @xmath44 are _ the eggs of the nest_.    the _ catalan numbers _",
    "@xmath45 are defined recursively by    @xmath46 @xmath47 ,    @xmath48 @xmath49 ,    or , equivalently , by the formula@xmath50 compare ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with the formal definition of bracketings in the introduction , and take into account the unicity of the representation of bracketings in form @xmath6 .",
    "then the following standard result follows :    2.1 . _",
    "the number of bracketings of size _ @xmath0 _ _  equals _ _ @xmath51 ( see , _ e.g. _ [ 8 ] ) .",

    "another inequality also follows from the definition of bracketings :    2.3 . _",

    "@xmath52 _ _ , _ _ @xmath55",
    "_ holds for every _ @xmath56__. _ _    hence if @xmath57 then @xmath58 for every @xmath59 .",
    "the following trivial observations are useful , too :    2.4 . _  if the groupoids _ @xmath20 _ _  and _ _ @xmath60 _ _  are isomorphic or antiisomorphic , then their spectra coincide .",
    "_ _    2.5 . _  if the groupoid _ @xmath60 _",
    "_  is a subgroupoid or a factorgroupoid of _",
    "_ @xmath20 _ _ , then _ _",
    "@xmath61 _ holds for every _",
    "@xmath0__. _ _    by 2.5 , in order to show that @xmath20 is catalan it is sufficient to find a catalan subgroupoid or factorgroupoid of @xmath20 .",
    "the next fact goes back to ukasiewicz ( for a proof , see [ 3 ] , ch .",
    "3.2 , or [ 11 ] , exercise 1.38 ) :    2.6 . _",
    "bracketings are uniquely determined by the places of their right ( or left ) parentheses between the symbols _",
    "_    next we introduce sequences of nonnegative integers which arise naturally from bracketings , and also contain full information on them .",

    "there exist finite maximal prefix - free sets ( _ fmpf - sets _ in short ) in @xmath62 , _",
    "e.g. _ , the set containing the empty word @xmath63 only , the sets @xmath65 _ etc_. assign to each bracketing an ordered sequence of words in @xmath62 inductively by the rule :    \\(a ) @xmath66 ,    \\(b ) if@xmath67and@xmath68then@xmath69    @xmath70    it is a routine to check that , in this way , a unique , lexicographically listed fmpf - set of @xmath0 words is assigned to every bracketing of size @xmath0 .",
    "now we can use the defining properties ( 1),(2 ) of catalan numbers to show that the number of distinct fmpf - sets of @xmath0 elements equals @xmath51 .",

    "similarly , _",
    "e.g. _ the right depth of @xmath42 in @xmath16 is the number of those subbracketings in which @xmath42 is contained in the right factor .",
    "the sequence consisting of the depths of @xmath19 in @xmath16 will be called _ the depth sequence of _ @xmath16 . _",
    "left _ and _ right depth sequences of _ @xmath16 are defined analogously .",
