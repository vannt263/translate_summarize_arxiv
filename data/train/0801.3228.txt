    "within the study of quantum computation , it is desirable to find ` natural ' problems for a quantum computer to solve i.e.  those that exhibit intrinsically quantum properties which elucidate the power of the device .",
    "for example , feynman first proposed the quantum computer as a device that naturally simulates hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "more recently , it has become apparent that finding the ground state energies of hamiltonians is qma - complete @xcite i.e.  this is a natural problem for the class where solutions can be efficiently verified on a quantum computer .",
    "the question that naturally arises with regards to both of these problems is that of the minimal properties that any such hamiltonian must posses . the same question , viewed from another perspective demands when we should expect efficient classical approximations to the properties and dynamics of hamiltonians .",
    "it is often found that the presence of symmetries , such as translational or rotational invariance , vastly simplify a problem .",
    "it may be hoped that accounting for these properties could make classical simulations of ground state , thermal or dynamic properties tractable and yet pertinent to physical phenomena .",
    "a straightforward example of this reduction is the description of a two - qubit mixed state @xmath0 . to do this",
    "ordinarily requires 15 real parameters .",
    "however , if the state is rotationally invariant , i.e.  @xmath1 for all single - qubit unitaries @xmath2 , then the family of possible states , the werner states @xcite , is parametrised by a single number . similarly , under the discrete permutation symmetry , @xmath3 , the family of states only contains 10 real parameters . the hope that the introduction of translational invariance reduces the complexity of finding ground states underpins studies such as matrix product states @xcite .    in this paper , we are primarily concerned with the effects that these symmetries have on the ability to efficiently simulate hamiltonian dynamics , and report that , in fact , the symmetries have no bearing ; the problem is bqp - complete i.e.  as hard as any quantum computation is to simulate on a classical computer .",
    "we will show this by constructing hamiltonians that implement arbitrary quantum computations .",
    "the first steps towards incorporating translational invariance , for both hamiltonian evolution and ground state properties , were taken in @xcite , which traded the spatial variation for another property such as the local hilbert space dimension , which grew as @xmath4 for @xmath5 spins .",
    "necessary to this construction was the inclusion of both a time label ( clock ) and position label at each site , so that all the information was available locally .",
    "processing was then achieved by implementing a read head that moved backwards and forwards over the system data .",
    "here , we use global control ( gc ) schemes @xcite to remove the necessity of both time and position labels . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we will describe how to apply global commands through hamiltonian evolution leading , in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , to the realisation of a translational invariant , nearest - neighbor hamiltonian of fixed local hilbert space dimension that implements arbitrary quantum computations , thus implying the classical intractability of simulation of the dynamics , of which there is already some evidence @xcite .",
    "the construction is easy to motivate because a gc scheme typically works by repeated application of a finite set of pulses ",
    "@xmath6 \" ,  @xmath7 \" etc . , which are local gates applied uniformly to all qubits in the system .",
    "as such , we immediately lose the need for spatial resolution in our hamiltonian . to remove the time resolution ,",
    "the program sequence is written on the initial state of some of the spins instead of encoding it in the hamiltonian .",
    "proceeding to a proof of qma - completeness for ground state properties still requires the introduction of spatially varying magnetic fields ( sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] ) , but this in turn has severe implications for the cooling of physical systems in the presence of random external fields .",
    "lloyd and co - workers proposed the concept of a universal quantum interface ( uqi ) @xcite .",
    "they proved that through manipulation of a single spin which is coupled to a larger system , the entire quantum system can be controlled , such that a quantum computation can be implemented on it .",
    "the proof was non - constructive , and there has recently been some interest in how such a device might be implemented @xcite .",
    "an example of one of the potential benefits of such a scheme is that it would in principle allow one to isolate the bulk system from the environment so that it s much less susceptible to noise . in comparison to schemes for hamiltonian evolution , the uqi protocol also incorporates the ability to prepare the initial state of the system , although we will not explore that aspect here .",
    "control theory proves the existence of solutions and offers numerical techniques to determine high - fidelity control @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we realise an exact uqi constructively .",
    "this will allow us to introduce most of the concepts required throughout the paper .",
    "indeed , we will use the uqi as a building block in the design of our computing hamiltonians .    consider a linear chain of @xmath5 4-dimensional spins .",
    "these 4-level spins can be assigned a structure as the tensor product of two qubits , labelled @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "systems @xmath9 will contain computational qubits , and systems @xmath8 will be used as a ` read head ' . if the spins are coupled by an interaction @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the swap operation between computational qubits @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the standard pauli operators , then control of just spins 1 , 2 and @xmath5 is sufficient to realise universal quantum computation .",
    "we can understand this by transforming the hamiltonian into a state transfer system .",
    "we are interested in the subspace when all the @xmath8 qubits are in the state @xmath16 , except for qubit @xmath12 which is in the state @xmath17 .",
    "we choose to denote that as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the state of the computational qubits in that step , and satisfies @xmath20 . with this definition",
    ", one can see that @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 are taken to be @xmath24 ) which is just the same as the model of state transfer studied by bose @xcite , except that one needs to apply local magnetic fields on spins 1 and @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , bose studied the evolution @xmath25 @xcite , where one can achieve an arrival probability of @xmath26 within a time @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "moreover , this transfer is heralded  by measuring system @xmath8 on qubit @xmath5 , we know whether or not the transfer has occurred without disturbing the computational qubits .",
    "if the transfer is not finished , we simply wait and try again . with this strategy",
    ", one can achieve an evolution which fails with probability less than @xmath28 in a time @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : uqi ] .     and @xmath9 .",
    "all the @xmath8s are initialised as @xmath16 .",
    "a @xmath30 is input at site 1 , and its arrival at site @xmath5 is monitored .",
    "the hopping hamiltonian is such that as the excitation moves between site @xmath12 and @xmath13 , a unitary @xmath31 is enacted on the computational qubits @xmath9 .",
    "thus , upon arrival at site @xmath5 , the unitary @xmath32 has been implemented .",
    "furthermore , this transfer is efficient.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the computational scheme now proceeds as follows .",
    "we assume the state to be initialised with all the @xmath8 qubits in @xmath16 , and the computational qubits are in state @xmath33 .",
    "the read head is initialised by placing the @xmath8 qubit of spin 1 in the @xmath17 state , and we perform a heralded transfer to spin @xmath5 , which means that when it is observed that the excitation has arrived at @xmath34 , we reset the spin to @xmath16 , and the computational qubits have changed to @xmath35 , which is simply a cyclic permutation of the computational qubits .",
    "this can be repeated , allowing any computational qubit to be placed on spin 1 .",
    "similarly , by starting the excitation on spin 2 , and removing it from spin @xmath5 , the computational qubits @xmath36 to @xmath5 undergo a cyclic permutation , allowing us to place any single qubit on spin 2 without disturbing spin 1 .",
    "one we have any arbitrary pair of qubits on spins 1 and 2 , which requires no more than @xmath37 cycles , our control of these two qubits allows the implementation of an arbitrary one- or two - qubit gate , which is sufficient for universal quantum computation .",
    "having demonstrated a relatively simple way to implement a uqi , we will now show how to modify the scheme to improve its capabilities .",
    "our first observation is that we can replace the swap gate , @xmath38 in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : uqi ] ) with any unitary @xmath39 , and the transfer @xmath40 implements the operation @xmath41 .",
    "the only difference is that we must ensure that the hamiltonian remains hermitian , which we do by writing it as @xmath42 the hamiltonian remains translationally invariant provided @xmath31 is the same as @xmath43 , just acting on different qubits .",
    "the next step is to see how to implement @xmath31 only on every second qubit .",
    "we achieve this by increasing the dimension of system @xmath8 to 3 .",
    "the idea is that instead of having a hamiltonian where the read - head hops to the right , implementing @xmath2 as it goes , it will alternate its value between 1 and 2 as it hops , and will only implement @xmath2 if it s hopping from 1 to 2 , and not 2 to 1 .",
    "thus , the new hamiltonian reads @xmath44 when we initialise the read - head on spin 1 , whether it s in the state @xmath17 or @xmath45 determines which pairs of computational qubits the @xmath2 is applied to , pairs @xmath46 or @xmath47 , and also what state we should be checking for on spin @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is odd , the read - head undergoes an even number of steps and arrives in the same state it started on spin 1 .",
    "finally , we might like the choice of applying more than one different @xmath2 , say @xmath2 and @xmath48 .",
    "again , we can achieve this with the system @xmath8 having 3 levels . @xmath49 by initialising the read - head on spin 1 as @xmath30 , the @xmath30 hops from site to site , and as it hops it implements @xmath2 . similarly",
    ", initialising spin @xmath50 in the state @xmath51 causes @xmath48 to be implemented .",
    "these constructions are readily combined so that if we want to implement , say , two different global commands , each of which only acts on every second qubit , then we can construct a translationally invariant hamiltonian that does it , using a read - head of dimension 5 , and thus an overall spin dimension of 10 .",
    "it is notationally convenient at this stage to decompose the 5-dimensional read - head at each site @xmath12 into @xmath52 the state @xmath53 ( the equivalent of @xmath22 in the previous notation ) , is the state which all the read - head systems are initialised in , except for one , and is used to indicate the absence of the read head .",
    "the systems @xmath54 and @xmath55 are both qubits .",
    "@xmath54 indicates if the read - head is ` active ' , and @xmath55 contains the ` program information ' , i.e.  which of the two gates to implement .",
    "when we propagate the read - head to the right , the interaction that is implemented on the data qubits is conditioned on the value of the read - head , and whether the read - head is active .",
    "as the read - head hops , we flip the active setting , so that it only applies an operation on every second qubit .",
    "in @xcite , a global control scheme was developed based on just two nearest - neighbor gates , swap ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 these gates need to be applied to distinct qubit pairings @xmath46 and @xmath47 across the entire lattice .",
    "evidently , this ties in very usefully with our uqi construction .",
    "if we implement these two gates within the hamiltonian , then the 10 level system is capable of universal quantum computation , where we only need single - spin control of spins 1 and @xmath5 to perform the transfer of the read - head , and to specify the program sequence ( i.e.  the order in which global commands are implemented ) .",
    "our aim is now to construct a hamiltonian that implements the entire evolution of the computation without even this basic level of control , but instead retaining the ability to prepare the system in some initial state .",
    "the first step is to remove the asymmetry between operations at either end of the chain ; we introduce periodic boundary conditions and a special marker state .",
    "the read - head will be emitted from one side of the marker state , and will arrive at the other side .",
    "it will then be down to our preparation of the initial state to select where this marker state is .",
    "the second step is to incorporate the program sequence .",
    "again , we will do this by writing the additional information in the initial state .",
    "this will require an additional two - level system at each site to denote whether that site constitutes a computational qubit or a spin that holds the program data .",
    "the previously mentioned marker will then be used to denote which of the program spins is the one that s being actively implemented .",
    "again , the read - head will be emitted from one side of this marker , but when it arrives on the other side , it will move the marker onto the next program spin ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic2 ] ) . the natural start and end points to the computation",
    "are when the active program marker is at either end of the program bus , and are detected by a change in the @xmath58 label between program and data spins .    .",
    "the read - head applies a unitary to each computational qubit consecutively , controlled off its value .",
    "when it reaches the active program region , it exchanges its data with the next step in the program.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to be specific , consider a 1d chain of spins of local dimension 31 , which can be decomposed into several subsystems @xmath59 the system @xmath60 is a qutrit , serving two different purposes depending on the label of the qubit system @xmath58 .",
    "if the label is @xmath16 , then @xmath61 , @xmath62 encode a computational qubit ( the system @xmath9 in the uqi construction ) , otherwise the qutrit @xmath60 contains program information  `` skip '' , @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "there is a single state which is not used yet , @xmath65 , and is reserved as the marker to denote which program trit is active .",
    "the single level @xmath66 is used to help moving the marker over a ` skip ' label .    whether a particular global gate works on pairings of qubits @xmath46 or @xmath47 is solely determined by the alignment of the active program trit with respect to the start of the block of data qubits , which is why we require skip ; such that the relative alignment changes . assuming that there are an odd number of spins in the system , if a read - head leaves a program trit in the active state , it returns in the inactive state .",
    "consequently , an inactive read - head in the location of the active program trit can be used to indicate that the read - head should move the active trit to the next one .",
    "the main term in the hamiltonian @xmath67 involves read - head propagation , and comes directly from the uqi construction . as such , we will not repeat it here .",
    "we must additionally incorporate a term to stop the read - head propagating if the state @xmath65 is present i.e. @xmath68 next , program manipulation ( when the read - head is in the neighborhood of the currently active program state ) : @xmath69 except that this does nt ( yet ) handle the skip .",
    "first , if we re in a region where we ve just arrived back from doing a loop , and should be moving onto a skip label @xmath70 and , secondly , the step over the skip label @xmath71 finally , the total hamiltonian is @xmath72 which is entirely a sum of two - body terms , so it can be represented as @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , for the permutation operator @xmath74 we have that @xmath75 i.e.  the hamiltonian is translationally invariant .",
    "if there are @xmath5 computational qubits in the system , then any efficient quantum algorithm is described by @xmath4 bits , and the total number of qubits in the system is @xmath76 , the sum of these two . again , we can invoke the fact @xcite that after an evolution time @xmath77 , the probability of having successfully completed the computation of @xmath78 , which is an efficient implementation .",
    "so , this translationally invariant , nearest neighbor hamiltonian evolution can implement any quantum computation , starting from a separable state .",
    "the fact that it starts from a separable ( although not translationally invariant ) state is important since it ensures that we are not encapsulating the difficulty of the problem within the preparation of the initial state .",
    "we conclude that the problem is bqp - hard .",
    "however , it is also known how to simulate hamiltonian evolution on a quantum computer @xcite , so the problem is bqp - complete .",
    "thus , as strongly as we believe that quantum computation is more powerful than classical computation is how strongly we believe that simulation of hamiltonian dynamics , even under the translational invariant restriction , is hard to simulate on a classical computer .",
    "so far , we have seen how a 1d hamiltonian with fixed local hilbert space dimension and fixed range interactions , which is translationally invariant , can implement an arbitrary quantum computation . however , this discrete symmetry is not nearly as restrictive as the continuous symmetry of rotational invariance , which requires the hamiltonian to satisfy @xmath79 for all single qubit unitaries @xmath2 .",
    "we will now show how to build this into the hamiltonian , retaining translational invariance and the ability to perform arbitrary quantum computations .",
    "the first step is to take the 31 dimensional construction @xmath80 , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ham_final ] ) , and replace each spin with 10 qubits . between these 10 qubits",
    ", there are several decoherence - free subsystems @xcite . for an @xmath5 qubit system ( @xmath5 even ) , there are decoherence - free subsystems which have @xmath81 levels for @xmath82 .",
    "these subsystems enable the storage of quantum information in a way that is not affected by collective decoherence @xmath83 .",
    "thus , encoding within one of these subsystems stores the information in a rotationally invariant way .",
    "we select any one of the 4 subsystems ( @xmath84 ) that is large enough to encode the 31 levels .",
    "transcribing @xmath80 into this new form automatically makes it rotationally invariant , although instead of being translationally invariant , it is periodic , with a repetition length of 10 qubits . we can thus write it as @xmath85 denoting the blocks of logical spins",
    "a summary of this is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ham_conversion ] .",
    "note that the initial state that the hamiltonian evolution acts on must also be encoded .",
    "however , it is encoded into fixed sized blocks which are separable from each other .",
    "thus , the initial state can still be efficiently represented on a classical computer , so we have not transformed the problem of simulation into the preparation of the initial state ",
    "it s still contained within the hamiltonian evolution .        in order to reintroduce translational invariance , we want to incorporate a local patterning of states that enables us to detect the alignment of the blocks of qubits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ham_conversion](c ) ) .",
    "the technique that we use is much clearer if we concentrate , initially , on restricting the arbitrary rotations to rotations about a single axis , @xmath86 .",
    "our problem is that a translationally invariant hamiltonian will be made up of sums of terms , each of which acts on a block of qubits , comprised of two logical spins .",
    "we need to make sure that if a hamiltonian term is not perfectly aligned with the block - wise patterning of the initial state , then it does not contribute to the evolution . to do this ,",
    "we introduce a patterning of the qubits which is still rotationally invariant , and yet flags the start of each block of spins . for @xmath87-rotation invariant states ,",
    "this can be done by taking each set of qubits that constitutes a logical spin , and introducing a qubit in the @xmath16 state between each of them .",
    "this means that in the initial state , there is never a pair of neighboring qubits in the @xmath88 state .",
    "thus , we use this to flag that a block of logical qubits is starting .",
    "so , each logical spin now constitutes 23 qubits , of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 was the previous logical spin encoded into a decoherence - free subsystem , and the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath91 .",
    "are repeated 8 times , handles a relative shift of an even number of qubits .",
    "section c does the same for an odd number of qubits , and the states @xmath92 are repeated 9 times .",
    "the difference in the number of repetitions of @xmath92 handles an edge effect that arises otherwise.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for @xmath87-rotations , we have the advantage that the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are rotationally invariant ( but not superpositions of them ) . for arbitrary rotations @xmath2 ,",
    "the construction of suitable flag states is much more involved , and is based on the fact that @xmath93 is a rotationally invariant two - qubit state .",
    "hamiltonian terms can be constructed which detect the presence , @xmath94 , or absence , @xmath95 , of such a state .",
    "there will be a correspondence between the hamiltonian term that detects the flag state , and the flag state itself , the only difference is that if the hamiltonian includes a term @xmath96 , the flag state can be made out of any two - qubit pure state orthogonal to @xmath97 , such as @xmath98 .",
    "we proceed by observing that it is relatively easy to suppress misalignments between the flag state and the hamiltonian term when the misalignment is by an even number of qubits , one simply ensures that a @xmath97 in the flag state and a @xmath96 in the hamiltonian align .",
    "this trick can be repeated for a misalignment by an odd number of qubits greater than 1 .",
    "there are two concerns remaining .",
    "firstly , whether there any edge effects arising and , secondly , how to deal with an offset of just one qubit .",
    "the first concern is overcome simply by using a large enough flag state , which is larger than the 10 qubits in the logical spin .",
    "an offset of one qubit is handled by incorporating four additional qubits in the flag state in the form @xmath99 .",
    "the interleaving of the two projectors ensures overlap after just a single shift .",
    "the entire state is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : heralding ] and requires 43 qubits in total .",
    "the projector onto the state is written as @xmath100 thus , the overall translationally and rotationally invariant hamiltonian acts on blocks of 106 qubits which are local on a 1d lattice .",
    "it is of the form @xmath101 where the @xmath102 are the same as in @xmath103 .",
    "the majority of the cost in terms of the range of the hamiltonian terms is due to the flag state , which we have made little attempt to optimise ; the important element is that the range of the terms is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "in previous studies , hamiltonian evolution has been used as a basis for classifying the problem of finding ground state energies of hamiltonians with similar properties as qma - complete . in the present case , this is not expected to be possible as there seems to be no way to encode the verifier s computation while retaining translational invariance . however , by breaking the translational invariance of @xmath80 , one arrives at similar results to @xcite , but only using local magnetic fields . to achieve this , we need to add several energy penalties ; to detect the solution to the verifier circuit , to initialise ancillas in @xmath16 and to prepare the initial state of the program tape for a specific computation corresponding to the verifier of the qma problem . to implement these penalties , we need to be able to locally detect that we are either at the beginning or end of a computation , requiring an increase in the local hilbert space dimension , such that the system @xmath104 has 2 levels .",
    "@xmath105 will be used as before , to indicate that the read - head is inactive .",
    "@xmath106 is a program command that will only get used once , as the first command .",
    "it is not necessary to program it , because two - body terms can readily detect the transition between the data and program spins .",
    "a further change is that the system @xmath8 must be increased to dimension 3 , leaving the overall hilbert space dimension as 49 .",
    "the extra level in @xmath8 serves a dual purpose .",
    "firstly , it can be used in the same way as @xmath106 , but to indicate the end of the computation , such that we can penalise the output qubit .",
    "secondly , it is used to help ensure that the correct computational sequence occurs .",
    "we will adapt the hamiltonian propagation such that if a read - head in either @xmath22 or @xmath30 arrives at the region of transition from data to program spins , it is converted into @xmath51 , which will continue to propagate through the program region until it gets to the active program spin , where it releases its information and gets reinitialised in @xmath30 .",
    "if the read - head reaches the end of the program region in the @xmath51 state , it is deactivated , and the computation ends . in particular , this means that if the system were to be initialised without an active program label , the computation is much shorter than it would otherwise have been .",
    "the hamiltonian is readily revised to take these alterations into account .",
    "an energy penalty for when the read - head passes a particular qubit in either @xmath106 or @xmath51 behaves exactly like the initial and final penalties that we require , so we simply use penalties @xmath107 where the tape value should be @xmath108 ( @xmath109 for ancillas ) , and hence @xmath110 implies a sum over all other possible program ( data ) states , including the active label @xmath111 . the final result term ( to test the output of the verifier on qubit @xmath112 ) is similar : @xmath113 we have to be sure that the computation is initialised correctly , with all the spins correctly arranged .",
    "this is achieved by adding a constant term @xmath114 . on program spins , this term is @xmath115 , ensuring that they are never data qubits . on data spins ,",
    "this term is the opposite , @xmath116 . taking all of this into account",
    ", one can directly apply the projection lemma of @xcite ,    let @xmath117 be the sum of two hamiltonians operating on some hilbert space @xmath118 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath119 is such that @xmath120 is the ground state eigenspace ( with eigenvalue 0 ) and the eigenvectors in @xmath121 have eigenvalue at least @xmath122 .",
    "then , @xmath123 @xmath124 denotes the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath125 .",
    "for example , with @xmath126 , one obtains @xmath127 we start with the total hamiltonian @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath80 takes a slightly different form to standard proofs since instead of mapping to a heisenberg chain , it maps to an xx model , and hence the eigenvalues are @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "there is an energy gap for computations that are fewer than @xmath76 steps , as well as a gap to the first excited state , @xmath132 for some constant @xmath133 . in the case",
    "where ` yes ' solutions exist , @xmath134 . in the case where there are only ` no ' solutions , we assign @xmath135 to find that @xmath136 and , furthermore , @xmath137 provided @xmath138 , imposing a polynomial relation between @xmath139 and @xmath140 . repeating the process on @xmath141 with @xmath142",
    ", shows that provided @xmath143 , @xmath144 where the verifier circuit of our qma problem accepts the result with probability less than @xmath28 .",
    "thus , by selecting @xmath145 all the terms @xmath146 and @xmath147 are polynomial in @xmath76 , and @xmath148 distinguishing the ground state energy of this hamiltonian to within @xmath149 determines the existence of ` yes ' solutions , and thus finding the ground state energy is qma - complete . in comparison",
    "to @xcite , all of the spatially varying terms are local magnetic fields .",
    "an identical proof holds using @xmath150 , our qubit hamiltonian which is both translationally and rotationally invariant , although the penalties are no longer local magnetic fields and are , instead , 53-body .",
    "making use the gc scheme introduced in @xcite , we have developed three main results .",
    "firstly , the universal quantum interface was described , and used as a building block for the second part , which showed that the evolution of a fixed hamiltonian which is translationally invariant on a nearest - neighbor chain and has fixed spin dimension can simulate any arbitrary quantum computation , thereby suggesting that the evolution is hard to simulate classically because it is a bqp - complete problem .",
    "even simulations over short time scales , @xmath151 , reveal the solution since we can project onto the heralded outcome .",
    "we have also extended this result to include qubit hamiltonians which are translationally and rotationally invariant , and still act on @xmath152-nearest neighbors which are local on a 1d lattice .",
    "finally , finding the ground state of a translationally invariant hamiltonian in the presence of a specific sequence of local magnetic fields is qma - complete .",
    "this has a more useful interpretation as a specific example of a random magnetic field i.e.  finding the ground state of a translationally invariant hamiltonian on @xmath76 spins in the presence of a random local magnetic field of size @xmath153 is qma - complete .",
    "this has some important consequences for physical scenarios involving cooling .",
    "for example , if one were to couple a refrigerator to a quantum system in an attempt to cool it , if the coupling is too strong , it would take a prohibitively long time to reach the ground state of the system , and that ground state is not the same ground state when it s not coupled to the refrigerator .",
    "conversely , the weaker one couples the system to the refrigerator , the longer it takes to cool .",
    "this helps to provide a motivation for the use of topological and self - correcting systems , which are carefully designed such that local magnetic fields can not affect the system degeneracy @xcite .",
    "since completing this work , we have been made aware of related work on evolution by translationally invariant hamiltonians @xcite and subsequent work @xcite which reduces the local hilbert space dimension in that case .",
    "this could presumably be used to reduce the number of levels required for the other results presented in this paper .    in the future , we intend to examine whether the present work enables any useful insights into the problem of determining ground states for translationally invariant systems .",
    "it certainly leads to some natural conjectures which we are working to prove .",
    "also , the technique for converting translationally invariant hamiltonians into translationally and rotationally invariant hamiltonians may be usefully applied to show that the two ground state problems have the same computational complexity ",
    "it is certainly true that the eigenstates of @xmath80 map through to @xmath150 .",
    "it remains to prove that the ground state of @xmath80 maps to the ground state of @xmath150 ."
