    "<S> we furthermore discuss the constraints limiting the maximum probability for emitting any desired photon , and use these to estimate upper bounds for the efficiency of the process . </S>",
    "<S> the model is not only valid for vacuum - stimulated raman adiabatic passages ( v - stirap ) in the strong - coupling and bad - cavity regime , but it generally allows controlling the coherence and population flow in any raman process .    driven by a wide range of possible applications in quantum information physics @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite , a large variety of single - photon emission schemes has been explored experimentally and theoretically throughout the last decade @xcite . amongst these , </S>",
    "<S> only cavity - based single - photon sources @xcite are in principle able of deterministically producing streams of single photons emitted into narrowband and indistinguishable radiation modes @xcite , which makes them the most promising candidates . moreover , with the photon generation process being reversible , these sources could also act as receivers , and thus form a universal quantum interface . the latter has been extensively discussed by j.i.cirac and h.j.kimble in their seminal papers on entanglement distribution in quantum networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key to this type of application is the availability of photon wave packets symmetric in space and time , as only these allow for a time - reversal of the emission process . </S>",
    "<S> custom photon shaping is also of interest for generating approximate gaussian pulse shapes which are shown to maximise the tolerance against mode - mismatch in interference - based quantum information processing schemes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> albeit the shaping of photons has been studied in the context of electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , it has been neglected to a large extend in cavity - related work . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the application of coherent population transfer schemes , such as stirap or v - stirap , in quantum - information processing ( qip ) requires the optimisation of these processes to a high degree of efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> while we have solved this issue for stirap @xcite , a different approach is needed if an atom is coupled to a cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this latter case in the following , and rely on an exact analytic solution similar to the one considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to maximise the probability of delivering single photons of any arbitrary temporal shape .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 , with the latter two being electronically stable . the photon number state of the cavity is denoted as @xmath1 or @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a driving laser couples @xmath3 with rabi frequency @xmath4 , and the cavity couples @xmath5 and @xmath6 with an effective rabi frequency @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the atom - cavity coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity field decays at rate @xmath9 , thus projecting the system into @xmath10 under the desired photon emission . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous emission from the excited state at the polarisation decay rate @xmath11 is the major loss mechanism . ]    </S>",
    "<S> first , we discuss how to tweak atom - cavity based photon - generation schemes to actually deliver single photons of arbitrary temporal shape . </S>",
    "<S> our model applies to raman transitions in three - level atoms with one branch of the transition driven by a laser pulse , and the other coupled to a cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[scheme ] outlines the levels and transitions involved and introduces all relevant parameters . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that laser and cavity are resonant with the respective transitions and neglect any possible detuning in the remainder of this paper . with the system prepared in state @xmath12 at time @xmath13 , driving </S>",
    "<S> the atom with a suitably shaped laser pulse leads to a nearly deterministic single - photon emission from the cavity . for any </S>",
    "<S> desired possible shape of the single - photon wavepacket , we derive an unambiguous analytic expression for the shape of the driving laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> its applicability is then tested against some concise examples .    the three states @xmath14 span the hilbert space of the system , and their corresponding probability amplitudes @xmath15 ^{t}$ ] evolve according to the schrdinger equation @xmath16where the rotating wave approximation has been applied and higher photon number states are neglected . the decay is taken into account phenomenologically by imaginary diagonal elements . </S>",
    "<S> we thus deal with spontaneous transitions within the system as if they give rise to total losses . </S>",
    "<S> this is well justified , as any spontaneous transition leads to dephasing , and therefore to a loss of the photon s usefulness , even if it were emitted thereafter . without loss of generality , </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore assume @xmath17 and @xmath8 to be real , with @xmath8 being a constant coupling and the rabi frequency of the driving pulse , @xmath18 , varying with time .    the usual way to model such a system is to assume some time dependency of the rabi frequency @xmath4 and to solve the master equation of the full system numerically , which yields the time - dependent probability amplitudes , and by consequence also the wave function of the photon emitted from the cavity . in order to achieve a high efficiency and/or a particular shape of the photon , a recursive feedback algorithm , often based on a variational principle , </S>",
    "<S> is then applied to optimise @xmath4 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this traditional procedure , we instead start from the far end and impose the desired shape of the evolution of the photon s probability amplitude , @xmath19where @xmath20 denotes the normalised photon wavefunction with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denotes the total probability for a single - photon emission from the cavity . as the field amplitude of the photon is solely determined by the probability amplitude of state @xmath6 scaled by @xmath23 , it is clear that @xmath24 and from the schrdinger equation we also obtain @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{cx - eq}\\ ] ] furthermore , with the population from the system being lost only via two possible channels @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we can write the probability to find the system in state @xmath12 simply as @xmath28 ,   \\label{probability - law } \\label{rhoee}\\ ] ] where the @xmath29 are the density matrix elements of the three - level system . note that we have chosen @xmath30 = 1 $ ] to satisfy the initial conditions . with </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian not comprising any detuning and assuming @xmath31 to be real , one can easily verify that the probability amplitude @xmath32 is purely imaginary , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both real . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can write @xmath35 with the desired photon shape as a starting point , we thus have found analytical expressions for the probability amplitudes of all levels involved . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the expression for @xmath36 from eq.([schrodinger ] ) yields the rabi frequency @xmath37 which is a real function that defines the driving pulse one needs to apply to obtain the desired photon shape .    the simplicity of the above procedure is striking . at first glance </S>",
    "<S> , it even seems that any desired single - photon pulse can be produced from the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore emphasise that one needs to verify that the desired photon is physically feasible . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the initial conditions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , together with eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cg - def ] ) and ( [ cx - eq ] ) restrict the possible photon shape to pulses with @xmath40 . in connection with @xmath30 = 1 $ </S>",
    "<S> ] , this also assures that @xmath38 . a further restriction arises from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cx - eq ] ) , which requires @xmath41 ( i.e. continuous in its first derivative ) . </S>",
    "<S> also the overall efficiency @xmath22 must remain within reasonable bounds , as will be evident from the following examples .    , and the lower trace the rabi frequencies @xmath4 required to obtain these photons from a system with @xmath42mhz within @xmath43s . case ( a ) shows @xmath4 for the @xmath44 pulse from eq.([sin2pulse ] ) for three different efficiencies , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed vertical line indicates the singularity in @xmath17 for the physically impossible case with @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> case ( b ) shows @xmath4 to obtain the top - hat like pulse from eq.([tophat ] ) with an efficiency of @xmath47 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now apply the above recipe to obtain a few specific photon shapes that are of general interest . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider photon wavepackets on a finite support ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 that are symmetric in time . a particular shape that meets the above initial condition is @xmath50 from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 - 7 ) , we are able to obtain the exact expression for @xmath4 that generates this symmetric photonic wave packet . immediately result from entering eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 - 7 ) into any computer algebra system ( cas ) . for the sake of clarity , we refrain from reproducing them here . ]    </S>",
    "<S> fig.[symm](a ) shows @xmath20 from eq.([sin2pulse ] ) together with @xmath4 for three different efficiencies @xmath22 , one of them being non - physical , i.e. having @xmath51 . for low efficiencies , </S>",
    "<S> almost no quanta are lost from the atom - cavity system . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath34 closely follows the ratio @xmath52 , so that the photon shape and @xmath4 have very similar form . </S>",
    "<S> this is not so for efficiencies close to unity , as the atom - cavity system then gets depleted by time . to maintain the required probability flow into @xmath6 , an indefinitely increasing rabi frequency is required </S>",
    "<S> it falls back to zero only towards the end of the pulse , resulting in the state transfer from @xmath6 back to @xmath12 , thus eventually stopping the photon emission at time @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the third depicted case is most instructive as we are asking for an overall photon emission probability of @xmath46 , which is physically not possible . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , our procedure leads to a singularity in the required rabi frequency at the very moment the initial state is completely depleted ( i.e. when @xmath53 ) . only up to that point , the shape of the emitted photon would follow the desired shape . </S>",
    "<S> we can use this fact for finding the maximum efficiency at which one can produce a photon of a given specific shape and duration . to do so , we seek conditions that deplete the atom - cavity system as much as possible , while at the same time following the desired photon shape and staying within the physically allowed regime where all diagonal elements of the density matrix to remain positive . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from eq.([rhoee ] ) that the latter condition might get violated by @xmath54 if one choses a too - high photon emission probability . </S>",
    "<S> hence we conclude that the maximum possible efficiency , @xmath55 , is reached when @xmath560,t]\\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\rho_{ee}(t)\\ge 0 \\ \\mbox{for all}\\   t   \\in\\ [ 0,t].\\ ] ] in some special cases this leads to a closed expression for @xmath55 , whereas in general , at least an upper bound for the maximum efficiency , @xmath57 , is found by asking for @xmath58 in the particular case of a photon shape ending as smoothly as it started , i.e.  for @xmath59 , the above condition yields @xmath60^{-1}. \\label{etamax}\\ ] ] here , @xmath61 is the cooperativity parameter of the cavity , with @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that a finite cooperativity parameter imposes the pulse - shape independent upper limit @xmath63 on the efficiency . with increasing pulse length @xmath49 , the integral in eq.([etamax ] ) </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically vanishes and the maximum efficiency is eventually only a function of the cavity parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this can already be seen from the @xmath44 pulse from eq.([sin2pulse ] ) and the parameters stated with fig.[symm](a ) , as these yield values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which barely differ from one another .    as a further relevant example </S>",
    "<S> , we show in fig.[symm](b ) the rabi frequency @xmath4 required to obtain a nearly top - hat like photon pulse which we model as @xmath66 in this particular case , maintaining the probability flux from the cavity constant despite the ongoing depletion of the atom - cavity system now results in @xmath67 within the range of the flat top , as @xmath54 decreases linearly with time . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath68 is the pseudo end - time the system would get depleted if one continues extracting light at a constant rate .    , and </S>",
    "<S> the lower trace the rabi frequencies @xmath4 required to obtain these photons from a system with @xmath42mhz , within @xmath69s and an overall efficiency of @xmath47 . case ( a ) shows @xmath4 for the symmetric case from eq.([twinpeaks ] ) , and case ( b ) shows the same with a phase change of @xmath70 between peaks , which is achieved by a corresponding phase jump of @xmath70 in the driving rabi frequency . ]    an interesting variant of the simple symmetric photon pulses are twin - peak photons . </S>",
    "<S> these have equal probabilities of having the photon in either one or the other of two imposed time bins , which are each represented by a well - defined spatio - temporal mode function . </S>",
    "<S> such photons are commonly used in quantum communication and cryptography , where time - bin entanglement is used to encode quantum bits @xcite . to calculate the driving - pulse rabi frequency needed to obtain such photons from a cavity , we assume that the twin - peak photons are described by @xmath71 from eqs . ( 2 - 7 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain again the exact expression for @xmath4 that evenly distributes the photon amongst the two peaks . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[twins](a ) shows that the two required peaks in @xmath4 are actually quite different from one another . </S>",
    "<S> this can be attributed to the fact that the probability to remain in the atom - cavity system is only @xmath72 at the beginning of the second pulse . </S>",
    "<S> hence we need to drive the system stronger to get the same probability flow from the cavity as with the first pulse . </S>",
    "<S> a variant of the twin - peak photon is shown in fig.[twins](b ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , the relative phase between first and second peak equals @xmath70 , which is obviously achieved by a phase jump of @xmath70 in the driving rabi frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this particular example corresponds to a zero - area photon pulse , with the integral pulse area of @xmath31 being zero . </S>",
    "<S> such a special pulse shape is of particular interest to population transfer and loss - free pulse propagation schemes @xcite . applied to single photons , it might be very useful in either single - atom or ensemble - based quantum memories .    </S>",
    "<S> for all the above examples , we would like to remind the reader that the desired @xmath73 is indeed the expected result from eq.([schrodinger ] ) , as @xmath4 has been found by solving the problem analytically . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , to validate our results , we also solved the schrdinger equation numerically . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath4 from all the above examples , we found that the photon pulse shape obtained from the numeric calculation reflects the desired pulse shape exactly , i.e. it deviates by at most the numerical error of the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this shows convincingly that our method for calculating @xmath4 indeed leads to the desired single - photon pulses .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we emphasise that our method equally applies to single - photon pulses of infinite support , such as solitons or gaussians . to properly account for these </S>",
    "<S> , the initial condition of having the quantum system in state @xmath12 then holds at @xmath74 . by consequence , </S>",
    "<S> also the integral in eq.([probability - law ] ) is running from @xmath75 to @xmath76 . apart from these minors changes to the initial boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> , the procedure to calculate @xmath4 remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> note that the maximum efficiency for a given pulse shape is still obtained whenever the system is totally depleted at the end of the pulse . in case of an infinite support , this means the efficiency is maximum if @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a very simple recipe for calculating the driving pulse in a ( vacuum ) stimulated raman transition to obtain any physically possible time evolution of the final quantum state and we have been discussing how this can be done with maximum efficiency . under these optimum conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative behaviour of the driving pulse deviates strongly from the desired photon shape . for the sake of clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we have restricted the discussion to the resonant case , and we have also been disregarding any possible phase modulation . </S>",
    "<S> extension of our method to include these is straightforward , but beyond the scope of this short letter . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have simply discussed how to obtain single - photon wave packets of arbitrary shape from an atom coupled to a cavity . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the model generally allows controlling the coherence and population flow in raman processes such as stirap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is seamlessly linking coherent control techniques @xcite with adiabatic passage protocols . </S>",
    "<S> we are convinced that the shaping of single - photon pulses and/or controlling the time evolution of raman processes with such an unprecedented precision will have a large impact on many applications in quantum information physics , atomic physics , spectroscopy and ultracold atoms . </S>"
