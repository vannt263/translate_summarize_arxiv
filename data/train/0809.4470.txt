    "the observation that carbon abundance in globular cluster red giants declines continuously as the stars evolve has inspired a great deal of observational and theoretical study ( e.g. , suntzeff 1981 , carbon et al .",
    "1982 , trefzger et al . 1983 , suntzeff & smith 1991 , weiss & charbonnel 2004 , denissenkov & tout 2000 , smith & briley 2006 , and similar work ) .",
    "canonically , abundances should be static on the red giant branch after the first dredge - up because of the broad radiative zone between the hydrogen - burning shell and the surface .",
    "progressive carbon depletion with rising luminosity on the giant branch is commonly interpreted as a sign of a non - convective `` deep mixing '' process that mixes carbon - depleted material from the hydrogen - burning shell , where the cn(o ) cycle is acting , to the surface ( e.g. , sweigart & mengel 1979 , charbonnel 1995 , charbonnel et al .",
    "1998 , bellman et al .",
    "2001 , denissenkov & vandenberg 2003 , and others ) . this same depletion of surface carbon abundance is also observed in red giants in the halo field ( e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "2000 ) , and is observed to occur at the same rate in the halo field as in globular clusters with halo - like metallicities ( e.g. , smith & martell 2003 ) .",
    "the process of deep mixing , inferred from observations of low [ c / fe ] , @xmath6(li ) , and @xmath7c/@xmath8c , is only observed to occur in stars brighter than the red giant branch ( rgb ) luminosity function `` bump '' @xcite .",
    "there are indications ( e.g. , langer et al .",
    "1986 , bellman et al .",
    "2001 ) that there may be carbon depletion in stars fainter than the rgb bump in the metal - poor globular cluster m92 , though there is not an obvious physical explanation for such a phenomenon . during the first dredge - up ,",
    "in the subgiant phase , the base of the convective envelope drops inward to smaller radius as the stellar core contracts , mixing the partially - processed material of the stellar interior with the unprocessed material at the surface . as hydrogen shell burning progresses , low on the giant branch , the temperature gradient in the star steepens and the base of the convective envelope begins to move outward , leaving behind a sharp jump in mean molecular weight ( the `` @xmath9-barrier '' ) at the point of its furthest inward progress @xcite .",
    "as the convective envelope retreats outward , this steep @xmath9 gradient finds itself within a radiative region between the hydrogen - burning shell and the base of the convective zone , where it can potentially hinder mass motions within the radiative zone .",
    "the red giant branch bump is an evolutionary stutter that occurs when the hydrogen - burning shell , which is advancing outward in mass , encounters the @xmath9 barrier .",
    "the sudden influx of hydrogen - rich material to the hydrogen - burning shell causes the star to become briefly bluer and fainter before it re - equilibrates and continues to evolve along the red giant branch ( e.g. , iben 1968 , cassisi et al .",
    "2002 ) . in a collection of stars with equal age and composition",
    ", this evolutionary loop will result in an unexpectedly large number of stars at a particular magnitude , and a bump in the differential luminosity function . at a fixed mass",
    ", the base of the convective envelope sinks lower in higher - metallicity stars during the first dredge - up , meaning that the rgb bump occurs at a fainter luminosity on the rgb in high - metallicity globular clusters than in low - metallicity clusters ( e.g. , zoccali 1999 ) .",
    "however , because evolutionary timescales shorten as stellar mass rises , there is a maximum mass of @xmath10m@xmath11 for stars to experience this evolutionary loop : above that mass , the hydrogen - burning shell does not move outward far enough to cross the @xmath9 barrier in the short time the star is on the rgb @xcite .",
    "the fact that deep mixing does not begin until after the hydrogen - burning shell crosses the @xmath9 barrier is interpreted by , e.g. , @xcite to mean that the gradient of mean molecular weight is the dominant factor in permitting or prohibiting deep mixing . indeed , @xcite point out that @xmath12 is `` the only physical quantity that changes significantly while approaching the hydrogen - burning shell '' in post - bump red giants .",
    "@xcite provide a somewhat different perspective : in their maximal - mixing models , the @xmath9 gradient inhibits mixing on the upper giant branch , but rotational mixing processes are not strong enough on the lower giant branch to cause observable changes in surface abundances , regardless of whether there is a steep @xmath9 gradient present .",
    "the underlying physical reason for deep mixing is not clear , though rotation has commonly been implicated since @xcite proposed meridional circulation as an explanation for cno anomalies in red giants .",
    "recent theoretical studies tend to focus on specific parametrizations and representations of the process ; for example , rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite , diffusion @xcite , and thermohaline mixing @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that meridional circulation , differential rotation , and shear turbulence do not create enough mixing to account for the observed variations in surface abundances , implying that additional hydrodynamical processes must be acting .",
    "the large study of surface abundances in field giants published by @xcite is a key to differentiating between models of deep mixing , since it demonstrates clearly the progressive depletion of carbon on the giant branch , as well as the sharp drop in @xmath7c/@xmath8c and @xmath6(li ) that happens at the rgb bump .",
    "the fundamental result from @xcite that all current deep mixing models must reproduce is that deep mixing is universal among post - bump red giants . @xcite",
    "consider mixing in terms of the `` critical @xmath9 gradient , '' the largest gradient in mean molecular weight that still permits deep mixing . in an observational study of seven mildly metal - poor red giants in the region of the rgb bump",
    ", they find that the critical @xmath9 gradient is independent of composition or mass .",
    "@xcite use the formalism of diffusion , with mixing depth and a diffusion constant as the important parameters , to model deep mixing .",
    "they find that the mixing depth does not depend strongly on metallicity , which implies that all red giants with a mass less than @xmath10m@xmath11 will experience deep mixing .",
    "their figures also show that the evolution of surface abundances of carbon and nitrogen are not particularly affected by metallicity , though reductions in @xmath6(li ) and @xmath7c/@xmath8c are more sensitive .",
    "@xcite show that the reaction @xmath13he(@xmath13he , 2p)@xmath14he causes a @xmath9-inversion in the outer edge of the hydrogen - burning shell , and claim that the resulting rayleigh - taylor instability is important in driving deep mixing .",
    "@xcite argue that the more complex process of thermohaline convection will act in that @xmath9-inversion region .",
    "they use the @xcite prescription to parametrize the thermohaline mixing as a diffusion process .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , they find that the evolution of the surface abundances of carbon , nitrogen , and lithium are all affected by overall stellar metallicity , while the @xmath7c/@xmath8c ratio approaches its equilibrium value very quickly at all metallicities .",
    "although questions of deep mixing rate ( e.g. , smith & martell 2003 ) and depth ( e.g. , charbonnel et al . 1998 ) have been studied observationally by many authors , the results available in the literature can be difficult to synthesize into a single conclusion .",
    "many studies focus on one or two particular clusters ( e.g. , da costa & cottrell 1980 , suntzeff 1981 , trefzger et al .",
    "1983 , lee 1999 ) , or attempt to correlate deep mixing with other cluster properties such as horizontal branch morphology @xcite , stellar rotational velocity @xcite or cluster ellipticity @xcite .",
    "individual authors and collaborations develop their own analysis tools , and the differences between spectral index definitions , model atmospheres , spectral synthesis engines , and abundance determination methods produce significant systematic differences in different authors abundance scales , as is clear from literature - compilation studies such as @xcite",
    ".    one can construct a phenomenological picture of deep mixing from this heterogeneous information , and it goes roughly as follows : all stars with mass less than @xmath10m@xmath11 will at some point have their hydrogen - burning shell cross the @xmath9-barrier .",
    "the @xmath9-barrier is larger than the critical @xmath9-gradient for deep mixing , so its destruction permits deep mixing to begin .",
    "deep mixing occurs continuously , and involves all material outside the radius where the @xmath9-gradient within the outer h - burning shell is critical .",
    "the onset of deep mixing happens lower on the giant branch for higher - metallicity clusters , because their @xmath9-barrier is at smaller radius .",
    "however , in higher - metallicity stars the hydrogen - burning shell is more compact @xcite , so that the radius where the @xmath9-gradient is critical is relatively further out in the hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "this means that the material mixed to the surface in higher - metallicity stars is less processed than in low - metallicity stars .",
    "various authors ( e.g. , charbonnel et al .",
    "1998 , cassisi et al .",
    "2002 ) use this relation between metallicity and mixing efficiency to study the structure of the hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "our goal in this project is to determine the relative efficiency of deep mixing across a broad range of metallicity by measuring present - day carbon abundances and depletion rates from a homogeneous set of globular cluster red giants in similar evolutionary phases .",
    "an earlier example of this approach is the study of @xcite , who found that [ c / fe ] on the upper rgb of m3 , m13 and ngc 6752 correlated with [ fe / h ] metallicity .",
    "in order to construct a data set that could be used to compare ch bandstrengths and [ c / fe ] abundances across a wide range of metallicity , we chose to obtain our data exclusively with the kast double spectrograph on the shane 3 m telescope at lick observatory , devoting 21 nights between july 2004 and august 2006 to the data collection . using a mirror in place of a dichroic , we directed all light to the blue side of the spectrograph , where the 600/4310 ( moderate - resolution ) grism produced a pixel spacing of @xmath15pix and a resolution of approximately @xmath16 over a wavelength range of 3400 to 5400@xmath17 .",
    "the detector at the time was a thinned 1200 @xmath18 400-pixel reticon ccd .",
    "table 1 lists names , positions , distance moduli , reddenings , metallicities , and number of stars observed for each globular cluster included in the survey .",
    "metallicities , distance moduli and reddenings were all taken from the february 2003 revision of the online compilation of @xcite .",
    "photometry for the individual globular clusters was taken from a combination of original photographic color - magnitude diagram work and proper - motion membership studies : @xcite for ngc 4147 , @xcite and @xcite for m3 , @xcite and @xcite for m5 , @xcite and @xcite for m13 , @xcite and @xcite for m10 , @xcite for m92 , @xcite for m15 , @xcite for ngc 6535 , @xcite and @xcite for ngc 6712 , @xcite for m56 , and @xcite and @xcite for m2 .",
    "for all stars , [ fe / h ] varies from @xmath19 ( m15 k77 ) to @xmath20 ( ngc 6712 lm11 ) in roughly equal steps . the vertical bars with widely spaced shading mark the bandpasses for the comparison bands of @xmath3 , and the narrowly spaced shading marks the corresponding science band .",
    "[ fig : lbf1 ] ]    targets were observed with a slit width of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23 depending on the seeing .",
    "ideally , three consecutive exposures of each star were taken , with typical exposure times of 1800s , to allow for cosmic ray removal . for 17 of the 42 stars in our sample ,",
    "there was only time to obtain one or two exposures on a particular night : four of them were observed again at a later date , nine have only two exposures , and four have only one exposure . in all cases ,",
    "the various exposures were reduced independently , and spectra of each individual star were coadded to produce a final ( unfluxed ) 1-d spectrum .",
    "the standard stars feige 34 , feige 110 , bd + 28 4211 , and bd + 33 2642 were observed with a @xmath24 slit aligned with the parallactic angle in an effort to capture maximal uv flux for reliable flux calibrations .",
    "since kast sits at cassegrain focus , spectra of the hehgcd lamp were taken directly following target spectra , with the same telescope pointing , slit width and dispersive element , to facilitate wavelength calibration and account for flexure .",
    "data reduction was accomplished with the xidl lowredux package made available by j.x .",
    "prochaska at uc santa cruz . this comprehensive , updated version of the xidl code used in earlier form in @xcite handles bias subtraction , flat - fielding , cosmic ray removal , object identification and extraction , sky subtraction , flexure correction , wavelength calibration , atmospheric correction , coadding and flux calibration .",
    "our targets are bright red giants in the range @xmath25 , which generally required 3600-second exposures with kast to obtain signal - to - noise ratios per pixel just redward of the g band of roughly 150 .",
    "these stars are all significantly brighter than the rgb luminosity function bump , meaning that any reasonable deep mixing rate will have had time to make a measurable decrement in surface carbon abundance .",
    "figure [ fig : lbf1 ] shows selected spectra from our sample , with metallicities ranging from [ fe / h]@xmath1 ( lowest spectrum ) to [ fe / h]@xmath2 ( highest spectrum ) in roughly equal steps .",
    "as [ fe / h ] rises , there is a clear increase in the strength of the mg b and mgh features near @xmath26 , a slight increase in the strength of the broad cn absorption feature at @xmath27 , and a reddening of the overall continuum shape that reduces the apparent depth of the ca ii h & k lines at 3935 and 3970@xmath17 and the cn bandhead at 3883@xmath17 .",
    "we use the index @xmath3 , recently defined in @xcite to be sensitive to carbon abundance and relatively independent of nitrogen abundance over a wide range of metallicity , to quantify the strength of the ch g band in all of our combined , flux - calibrated spectra . as with most spectroscopic indices ,",
    "@xmath3 is measured as the magnitude difference between the integrated flux in the relevant absorption feature ( the `` science band '' ) and the integrated flux in two nearby relatively absorption - free bands ( the `` comparison bands '' ) . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the science band for @xmath3 runs from 4297@xmath17 to 4317@xmath17 , and the comparison bands run from 4212@xmath17 to 4242@xmath17 and 4330@xmath17 to 4375@xmath17 .",
    "the bandpasses for @xmath3 are shown as shaded regions in figure [ fig : lbf1 ] , with the more widely spaced lines marking the comparison bands , and the more closely spaced shading lines marking the science band .",
    "one - sigma errors on measured values of @xmath3 were determined as in @xcite : for stars observed three or more times , @xmath28 is calculated as the standard deviation on the mean of the individual index values measured from flux - calibrated , uncombined spectra , and for stars observed twice , @xmath29 .",

    "[ fig : lbf2 ] ]    to convert bandstrengths to [ c / fe ] abundances , we follow a method similar to that described in @xcite , matching measured values of @xmath3 to values derived from synthetic spectra interpolated to match the data in @xmath31 and [ fe / h ] ( the `` model grid '' ) .",
    "we select the subset of the model grid with a canonical [ n / fe ] value of @xmath32 and interpolate between model @xmath3 values to find a preliminary [ c / fe ] .",
    "we then interpolate the model grid to that preliminary [ c / fe ] value , allow [ n / fe ] to have its full range of possible values , and interpolate between model values of the cn bandstrength index @xmath33 @xcite to calculate a preliminary [ n / fe ] abundance .",
    "if that preliminary [ n / fe ] is more than 0.1 dex lower or higher than the canonical value , we interpolate the model grid to match it and repeat the @xmath3-matching process to obtain a final [ c / fe ] abundance . as a check",
    ", we also re - calculate [ n / fe ] using the final [ c / fe ] value , and we find that the difference between preliminary and final [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] is never large .",
    "this is due in large part to the nitrogen - insensitivity of @xmath3 : for a fixed [ c / fe ] , [ fe / h ] and @xmath34 , varying [ n / fe ] by large amounts does not change @xmath3 significantly .",

    "we determine these noise - based [ c / fe ] errors for each star in our sample as half the difference between [ c / fe ] calculated for @xmath49 and [ c / fe ] calculated for @xmath50 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : lbf2 ] , these errors are generally smaller than 0.05 dex , and are all smaller than 0.12 dex .",
    "they are also comparable in magnitude to the errors introduced by our index - matching method ( the `` method - based error '' ) .",
    "we calculate a method - based error by choosing a random ( [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] ) point within the abundance range spanned by our model grid , interpolating to find the @xmath3 value that corresponds , and using that value to re - calculate [ c / fe ] assuming a canonical [ n / fe ] value of @xmath32 .",

    "the addition of noise to the synthetic spectra was done to make them resemble the observed spectra they are compared to , so that the calculated method - based error would be an accurate representation of the actual error introduced by our carbon - determination method .",

    "the matter of systematic offsets to our abundance scale resulting from our flux calibration , temperature scale , or choice of model atmosphere is not as straightforward to assess .",

    "since each index covers slightly different wavelength regions , we interpret this to mean that each one captures different information from the spectrum . in general , indices tuned for low - metallicity stars can have wider comparison bands , and do not need to be as carefully defined as indices for high - metallicity clusters , because there are absorption features that are important to avoid in high - metallicity spectra ( for example , the cn banhdead at 4215@xmath17 ) .",

    "we make two conclusions from this exercise : first , that disagreement between [ c / fe ] calculated from indices that purport to measure the same underlying abundance can be a sign of flux - calibration or temperature - scale errors , and second , that continuum - division is likely preferable to flux - calibration , so that this potential source of error can be avoided altogether .    however , the [ c / fe ] values calculated from @xmath3 are barely changed by the flux adjustment . as discussed in @xcite ,",

    "however , the lack of a clear correlation in figure [ fig : lbf8 ] does not necessarily mean that there is no dependence of deep mixing rate on stellar metallicity .",
    "the question of how much time each observed star has spent in the deep mixing phase is the key to interpreting our data : we selected targets with similar absolute magnitudes , but it is well - known observationally @xcite and theoretically @xcite that the rgb bump occurs at lower luminosity in more metal - rich globular clusters . in addition , low - metallicity red giants evolve more quickly than high - metallicity red giants of the same mass ( e.g. , riello et al .",

    "we calculate @xmath85 for the eleven clusters in our sample by a simple linear interpolation from the @xcite data .",
    "the conversion from @xmath87 to @xmath89 is based on yale - yonsei @xcite isochrones and evolutionary tracks .",
    "for each cluster metallicity , we created an evolutionary track for a star with appropriate metallicity and a mass taken from the @xmath84 point in a metallicity - matched 12 gyr yy isochrone .",
    "we then chose points in the evolutionary track near @xmath85 and @xmath84 , and we calculate @xmath90 based on those points .",
    "figure [ fig : lbf10 ] shows our calculated values for @xmath90 for all clusters in our sample , along with a best - fit polynomial ( solid curve ) and a best - fit exponential ( dashed curve ) , which are nearly identical .",
    "combining these two steps , we calculate the carbon depletion rate @xmath91[c / fe]@xmath92 as [ c / fe]@xmath93 , assuming that the initial [ c / fe ] abundance is solar , and that deep mixing begins at the rgb bump for all stars .",
    "figure [ fig : lbf11 ] shows @xmath91[c / fe]@xmath92 versus [ fe / h ] for all stars in our sample , and there is a clear downward trend in carbon depletion rate as metallicity increases .",
    "we see no break or corner in the relation between @xmath91[c / fe]@xmath92 and [ fe / h ] , indicating that mixing is never completely prohibited in our sample .",
    "this may happen at metallicities above [ fe / h]@xmath94 , if the hydrogen - burning shell is so compressed that the critical @xmath9-gradient is reached outside it .",
    "our result is in agreement with the theoretical predictions of @xcite , and confirms that the process of deep mixing is less effective in relatively high - metallicity red giants .",
    "[ c / fe]@xmath92 versus [ fe / h ] for all of the stars in our sample .",
    "there is a clear downward trend with rising metallicity , a result predicted by the deep mixing models of , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "[ fig : lbf11 ] ]",
    "in summary , the results of this work show that within the [ fe / h ] range @xmath95 to @xmath96 dex the rate of deep mixing varies with metallicity .",
    "we measure ch bandstrength using the index @xmath3 , which was designed to be valid across a broad range in [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "carbon abundances are determined by matching ch bandstrengths measured from the data to bandstrengths measured from specifically - designed grids of ssg synthetic spectra . under the assumption",
    "@xcite that deep mixing begins at the rgb luminosity function bump , we establish the carbon depletion rate for a given star as the change in its [ c / fe ] from an initial solar value divided by the time elapsed since the onset of mixing . since the rgb luminosity function bump is fainter in high - metallicity globular clusters than in lower - metallicity globular clusters , and higher - metallicity red giants",
    "evolve more slowly than lower metallicity red giants , higher - metallicity stars at a given absolute magnitude qualitatively ought to have spent more time mixing than their lower - metallicity counterparts . in order to quantify the time spent mixing as a function of metallicity and absolute v magnitude , we interpolate the @xcite observational data on @xmath85 as a function of metallicity to the metallicities of the clusters in our study , then use metallicity - appropriate yale - yonsei @xcite isochrones to convert @xmath87 for each individual star into @xmath89 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : lbf10 ] , the lower - metallicity red giants do evolve more quickly , and therefore spend less time mixing than the higher - metallicity red giants in this study .",
    "however , dividing [ c / fe ] by @xmath89 for each individual star produces the result that the deep mixing rate is roughly twice as large at [ fe / h]@xmath97 than at [ fe / h]@xmath98 , as can be seen in figure [ fig : lbf11 ] .",
    "this present analysis includes some assumptions worth noting , since they may need to be more carefully examined if this result is to provide constraints for theoretical models of deep mixing . to express @xmath67 as a straightforward exponential in time , we hold the mass of the stellar envelope constant , though it shrinks continuously as the hydrogen - burning shell proceeds outward @xcite .",
    "we also hold the mixing rate @xmath65 constant , though it is controlled by the structure of the hydrogen - burning shell , and may well evolve .",
    "in addition , we implicitly assume in constructing figure [ fig : lbf11 ] that all stars have equal ( and solar ) initial abundances of carbon . a primordial depletion of @xmath99 dex in a subset of our sample",
    "would thus be misinterpreted as an artificially high mixing rate in those stars .",
    "a study of carbon abundances in fainter post - bump red giants , or pre - bump giants , in the globular clusters included in this study , would allow for direct calculation of @xmath91[c / fe]@xmath92 without assumptions about the initial carbon abundance .",
    "in addition , a study of carbon depletion rates in high - metallicity red giants , either in old open clusters or in high - metallicity globular clusters , would allow an estimation of the maximum metallicity at which deep mixing still operates .",
    "that maximum metallicity would be helpful for constraining the various models of deep mixing . nevertheless , our fundamental result , that carbon depletion proceeds more quickly in low - metallicity globular cluster red giants than in their high - metallicity counterparts , is robust , and provides a clear affirmation of present theoretical models .",
