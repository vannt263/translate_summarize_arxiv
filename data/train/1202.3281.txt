    "to apply perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) to study hadronic processes such as the deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering or semi - inclusive hadron production process , provided that qcd factorization theorem is applicable there , the cross section is able to be expressed as a convolution of the two parts : the process - dependent perturbative qcd(pqcd ) calculable short - distance parton cross section , and the universal long - distance functions which can be extracted from experiments , but can not be calculated by pqcd because the strong interaction in the long distance is nonperturbative .",
    "these long - distance functions are the fundamental nonperturbative ingredients for the analysis of the scattering processes involving hadrons .",
    "the fragmentation functions and the quark - distribution functions are belonged to this category .",
    "the fragmentation functions , @xmath1 indicate the probability for a hadron fragmented from a quark with the momentum fraction @xmath2 , where the subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicate the hadron and quark , respectively .",
    "it plays an important role in analyzing the semi - inclusive processes in the electron - positron scattering , deep - inelastic proton - proton scattering , and so on  @xcite .",
    "the parton distribution functions for hadrons @xmath5 , @xmath6 stand for the distribution of the momentum fraction @xmath7 carried by a parton inside a hadron . in analyzing the deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering ,",
    "the parton distribution functions becomes crucial for instance .",
    "we note that these two nonperturbative functions are inter - related analytically via the drell - levy - yan ( dly ) relation  @xcite .",
    "note that this analyticity is possible only if those functions can be described by the same function , defined in the different regions  @xcite .",
    "those functions have been studied intensively for several decades but still not fully - understood  @xcite .",
    "empirically , their information can be extracted from the available high - energy lepton - scattering data by global analyses with appropriate parameterizations satisfying certain constraints  @xcite .    from theoretical points of view",
    ", there have been numerous works done for those functions so far : the momentum sum rules for the fragmentation functions were proven in terms of qcd in a rigorous manner  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model was applied for these functions with the quark - jets and resonances , which satisfied the momentum sum rules .",
    "it turned out that the quark - jet contributions provide considerable contributions to the various fragmentation functions at the small @xmath2 region .",
    "the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) method presented considerably successful results for the valance - quark distribution functions for the pion and kaon  @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo simulations with supersymmetric ( susy ) qcd were carried out to obtain the fragmentation function up to a very high energy in the center - of - mass frame @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the collins fragmentation functions which play an important role in the transverse - spin physics have also been studied in the quark - ps meson coupling model  @xcite .",
    "dihadron fragmentation functions were also studied in the same theoretical formalism  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the quark - distribution function has also been studied with a nonlocal effective - chiral lagrangian , employing the ds method  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors made use of the the drell - yan process including the soft - gluon resumption for the valance - quark distributions .",
    "a review for the experimental and theoretical status for valance - quark distribution for the nucleon and pion is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the instanton - motivated approaches were taken into account for computing the quark distribution functions , manifesting the nonlocal quark - pseudoscalar ( ps ) meson interactions . employing the nonlocal chiral quark model ( nlchqm ) which is motivated by the dilute instanton - liquid model ( lim ) , which is properly defined in euclidean space in principle  @xcite .",
    "nlchqm have accumulated successful results for various nonperturbative quantities in good agreement with experiments as well as lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations .",

    "@xcite we use this model to calculate the fragmentation functions and the quark - distribution functions of the pions .",
    "there we limited ourselves in the su(2 ) flavor sector .",
    "our result is substantially different from the results of other models with local quark - meson couplings . in the present work ,",
    "we extend our studies into the three flavors , @xmath9 , i.e. those functions for the positively charged pion and kaon , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 , taking into account the explicit flavor - su(3)-symmetry breaking .",
    "we present the result with the two different explicit su(3 ) flavor breaking patterns associated with two sets of the current quark masses .",
    "furthermore , we figure out that our result of kaons fragmentation functions are significantly different from the ones from the other models.the calculated distribution and fragmentation functions are evolved to high @xmath0 by the dglap evolution using the code _ qcdnum _  @xcite to compare with the empirical data . by doing so",
    ", we see qualitative agreement between our result and the empirical data , although some underestimates are shown in the small-@xmath12 regions , according to the absence of the quark - jet contributions possibly  @xcite .",
    "the present report is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce nlchqm that we use and sketch our computation procedure . in section",
    "iii we present our numerical results and related discussions .",
    "the final section is devoted for the conclusion and future perspectives .",
    "the process that an off - shell quark ( @xmath4 ) is fragmented into an unobserved set of particles ( @xmath13 ) and on - shell hadron ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. @xmath14 . is described by the unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath15 .",
    "a schematic figure for this function is given in the right of fig .",
    "it can be written with the light - cone gauge as follows  @xcite : @xmath16|_{zk^-=p^-},\\ ] ] where note that @xmath17 indicates the flavor factor for the corresponding fragmentation processes .",
    "the values for @xmath17 for the ps meson , i.e. @xmath18 , are given in table  [ table0 ] in appendix .",

    "the correlation @xmath28 reads generically : @xmath29 here @xmath30 represents the quark field , whereas @xmath31 the spatial interval on the light cone .",
    "furthermore one can integrate over @xmath32 , @xmath33 the factor of @xmath34 is due to the fact that the integration is over @xmath35\\,\\bm{k}$ ] , the transverse momentum of the produced hadron with respect to the quark direction , and there is a relation between @xmath36 and @xmath32 : @xmath37 .",
    "the integrated fragmentation function satisfies the momentum sum rule : @xmath38 where @xmath3 indicates for all the possible hadrons fragmented .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) means that all of the momentum of the initial quark @xmath4 is transferred into the momenta of the fragmented hadrons . from the drell - levi - yan ( dly )",
    "relation  @xcite , @xmath15 can be related to the parton distribution function @xmath39 , provided that there is a proper analytic continuation .",
    "the relation is as follows , @xmath40 where @xmath7 denotes the momentum fraction possessed by a parton inside the hadron .",
    "a schematic figure for the quark - distribution function is depicted in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .    in this article",
    ", we use nlchqm to investigate these nonperturbative objects , i.e. fragmentation and parton distribution functions .",
    "this model is motivated from the dilute instanton liquid model  @xcite .",
    "we note that , to date , various nonperturbative qcd properties have been well studied in terms of the instanton vacuum configuration and the results are comparable with experiments and lqcd simulations  @xcite . in that model , nonperturbative qcd effects are deciphered by the nontrivial quark - instanton interactions in the dilute instanton ensemble .",
    "however this model by nature is defined in euclidean space because the ( anti)instantons are well defined there by signaling the tunneling between the infinitely degenerate qcd vacua .",
    "although there have been no rigorous derivation on the analytic continuation from the instanton physics to those in minkowski one , there are still several challenging studies which try to apply the idea of the instanton physics to the physical quantities defined properly only in minkowski space , such as the light - cone wave function  @xcite . following those studies",
    "we adopt the effective chiral action ( echa ) from nlchqm in minkowski space as follows : @xmath41=-\\mathrm{sp}\\ln\\left[i\\rlap{/}{\\partial } -\\hat{m}_f-\\sqrt{m(\\loarrow{\\partial}^2)}u^{\\gamma_5}\\sqrt{m(\\roarrow{\\partial}^2)}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the functional trace @xmath44 over all the relevant spin spaces and su(3 ) current - quark mass matrix , @xmath45 , respectively .",

    "<S> we investigate the unpolarized pion and kaon fragmentation functions , employing the nonlocal chiral - quark model , which manifests the nonlocal interactions between the quarks and pseudoscalar mesons , considering the explicit flavor - su(3)-symmetry breaking in terms of the current - quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we study the quark - distribution functions , derived from the fragmentation ones with the drell - yan - levi relation . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are evaluated to higher @xmath0 by the dglap evolution and compared with the empirical data . </S>",
    "<S> the ratios between the relevant valance quark - distribution functions are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the present results are in relatively good agreement with available data and other theoretical estimations . </S>"
