    "the central conflict in ultracold molecular scattering is this : on the one hand , at ultralow temperature scattering observables are few in number , often limited to a single two - body loss rate , sometimes complimented by an elastic cross section , and limited to explicit information on only a small number of partial waves . on the other hand , the underlying dynamics that drives scattering consists of complex motion on a three- or four- ( or more- ) body potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "this surface is moreover anisotropic , so that many more angular momentum states may contribute to scattering than the few represented by the asymptotic partial waves .",
    "how to properly distill the elaborate dynamics of the collision complex into observables remains an open question .    for ultracold scattering of alkali - metal atoms ,",
    "the link between the pes and observables is cemented by the observation of fano - feshbach resonances . here , the two - body pes s involved are comparatively simple , and the remaining undetermined parameters , consisting most simply of a pair of scattering lengths and a @xmath1 coefficient , are used to fit data and to produce predictive models @xcite .",
    "likewise , the observation of resonances should assist in interpreting collisions of molecules with light , isotropic partners such as helium @xcite , or perhaps even light molecules colliding with each other @xcite .",
    "in such a case _ ab initio _ potentials are likely to represent something close to reality , and to be readily fine - tuned by fitting to resonances .    in a recent paper",
    "we have begun to explore the role of resonant scattering on heavier species with highly anisotropic interactions , specifically , alkali - metal atoms colliding with alkali - metal dimers , at low temperature @xcite . a main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite was that the density of states ( dos ) of rotational and vibrational motion of the three - atom complex may be quite high , e.g. , perhaps of order 1 per gauss in rb + krb scattering . while these resonances may conceivably be resolvable experimentally ,",
    "it is likely an impossible and unrewarding task to generate them explicitly from a pes .",
    "rather , ref .",
    "@xcite adopted a statistical treatment of the resonances , asking what properties of the complex could be assessed on average . a unifying concept in",
    "this analysis was the mean decay width of the resonances , as given by the rice - ramsperger - kassel - marcus ( rrkm ) expression found in chemical transition state theory @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the density of states in the vicinity of the collision energy , and @xmath4 is the number of open scattering channels .",
    "in ultracold collisions involving alkali - metal molecules , a large value of @xmath3 and a small value of @xmath4 ( perhaps even @xmath5 ) implies a dense forest of very narrow resonances .    in the present paper",
    "we extend this analysis to collisions of pairs of alkali - metal dimers .",
    "a main finding is that the dos for the four - atom complex is vastly larger than for the 3-atom complex , so that the resonances so formed can not be resolved at all , even on the @xmath6 @xmath0k temperature scale of experiments . in this `` berresonant '' regime , all observables become averaged over many resonances , effectively bypassing the inherent intricacy of the complex .",
    "the resulting non - resonant cross sections are then in principle actually easier to compute and interpret than the atom - molecule case .",
    "we apply this idea to two cases",
    ". one case is rbcs , which is not chemially reactive at ultralow temperature , and for which therefore @xmath7 in its absolute , that is , ro - vibrational and spin ground state . in this case , the resulting extremely narrow resonances imply long complex lifetimes , potentially on the order of experimental times .",
    "this means not only that some fraction of the molecules remain `` invisible , '' hidden inside four - body complexes , but also that the complexes , upon colliding with another molecule , can be ejected from the trap , leading to an unwelcome delayed - three - body loss mechanism . in this article",
    "we provide estimates of the loss rates implied by this mechanism , including the effect of electric fields .",
    "a second example is afforded by krb molecules , which remain chemically reactive even at ultracold temperature @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath4 includes all possible channels of the products of reaction , and is quite large .",
    "thus the resonance width implied by ( [ rrkm ] ) is far larger than the mean resonance spacing , and resonances are expected to be unobservable in the loss rates .",
    "we consider collisions of diatomic molecules ab ( where a and b denote alkali - metal atoms ) in their @xmath8 electronic ground state , their @xmath9 vibrational ground state , their @xmath10 rotational ground state , and some nuclear spin states @xmath11 , assumed to be decoupled in a magnetic field .",
    "we pay attention to the nuclear spins in order to completely specify the state , and to properly account for bose / fermi symmetrization , but they play little other role in the theory we describe below",
    ". moreover , let @xmath12 denote the partial wave of the incident channel , describing the relative orbital angular momentum of the molecules .",
    "an important quantity in the theory is then the total angular momentum ( exclusive of the nuclear spin ) @xmath13 . since we consider only asymptotic states with @xmath14 , the value of @xmath15 is identical to the partial wave @xmath16 in a given incident collision channel .    introducing the shorthand notation @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 denotes the appropriate symmetrization for bosons or fermions ) ,",
    "the collision cross sections can be written in terms of the scattering matrix elements @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath21 is the wave number of the colliding molecules and @xmath22 accounts for their indistinguishability , that is , @xmath23 if they are in identical states and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "the indices @xmath25 summarize the quantum numbers of ab in the incident channel , and are extended to include the product channels in the case of reactive collisions . even in an electric field ,",
    "the projection of the total angular momentum onto the field axis is conserved .",
    "following ref @xcite , we construct a scattering theory that incorporates both a high density of resonant states of the collision complex , and threshold effects relevant to ultralow energies .",
    "this is achieved by combining multichannel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) with the methods of random matrix theory . in doing so",
    ", we exploit the conceptual difference between the spin channels @xmath26 that describe physics at large interparticle separation @xmath27 ; and the numerous resonant states of the complex , denoted @xmath28 , that differ by rotational and vibrational quantum numbers from @xmath29 .",
    "the key feature of mqdt is that one only needs to provide the reactance matrix @xmath30 which is defined at a `` matching radius '' @xmath31 that defines the boundary between short- and long - range physics .",
    "the mqdt formalism as outlined in refs.@xcite accounts exactly for the wave functions for @xmath32 and directly yields the physical scattering matrix @xmath33 via standard algebraic procedures .    as in our previous work , for @xmath32",
    "we assume simplified long - range interactions of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the threshold of the @xmath29th channel , which may depend on a magnetic field @xmath36 . here , @xmath37 is the reduced mass of the scattering partners and @xmath1 is their van der waals coefficient , which is taken to be isotropic in this model .",
    "these potentials are used to calculate the relevant mqdt parameters from which the cross sections are ultimately constructed .",
    "we will see below how to account for nonzero electric fields .",
    "the short - range @xmath38-matrix is constructed according to the dictates of random matrix theory @xcite as @xmath39 it is indexed by the @xmath40 asymptotic channels @xmath29 , but is influenced by the myriad ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) resonant states @xmath0 .",
    "the input parameters for the resonant scattering theory , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ksr ] ) , are the zero - order positions @xmath42 of the resonances and the coupling elements @xmath43 to the asymptotic channels . within our statistical framework , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "are taken as random variables based on the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite . by employing such a model , we assume that the collision complex corresponds classically to a long , chaotic trajectory that ergodically explores a large portion of the allowed phase space .",
    "the goe is in turn specified by the mean resonance width .",
    "it was determined in @xcite that a reasonable approximation for this width is the rrkm result itself , @xmath44 where @xmath40 is the total number of asymptotic channels in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 ground state manifold .",
    "further narrowing of the resonances due to the wigner threshold laws is accounted for within the mqdt theory .",
    "thus the resonance model is completely specified by the density of states @xmath3 .",
    "we estimate the dos in the same way as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "namely , we posit a set of approximate potential curves @xmath45 here @xmath46 is a lennard - jones potential with the correct @xmath1 for the molecule - molecule interaction , and tuned to a depth equal to the binding of the a@xmath47b@xmath47 complex relative to the ab + ab threshold . this potential is augmented by a partial wave @xmath48 of the complex , and by a threshold energy @xmath49 corresponding to ro - vibrational excited states of the molecules in the complex .",
    "key to our dos approximation is that _ all _ possible states that preserve the total angular momentum @xmath50 and conserve energy are included .",
    "although the total @xmath15 is limited to a few values as dictated by the incident partial wave @xmath16 of scattering , the angular momentum quantum numbers of the complex can span into the hundreds ( see below ) .",
    "having identified all such relevant potentials ( [ lj ] ) , we compute their bound states lying near the incident threshold , and by counting them determine the dos .",
    "the complete dos thus constructed assumes ergodicity , i.e. , that all states not forbidden by conservation laws are actually potentially populated .",
    "however , this assumption can be adjusted by , say , reducing the maximum value of orbital angular momentum @xmath48 used in the estimate .",
    ".ro - vibrational densities of states for @xmath51 and corresponding one - open - channel rrkm lifetime @xmath52 ; for @xmath53 one has @xmath54 . regarding the magnetic dipole moment , in the case of ( fermionic ) krb we assumed for odd @xmath15 that the both molecules are in their lowest state ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) ;",
    "for even @xmath15 one molecule is considered to be in this lowest state , the other in the next higher one ( @xmath57 , @xmath56 ) . for ( bosonic )",
    "rbcs it is the other way round : for even @xmath15 they are in the same state ( @xmath56 , @xmath58 ) and for odd @xmath15 in the next higher one ( @xmath56 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "values used for the magnetic moments are @xcite : ( @xmath60k@xmath61rb ) @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath62khz / g ; @xmath57 , @xmath56 , @xmath63khz / g ; ( @xmath61rb@xmath64cs ) @xmath56 , @xmath58 , @xmath65khz / g ; @xmath56 , @xmath59 , @xmath66khz / g .

    "[ fig : krbcsinel ] we compare representative inelastic @xmath67-wave scattering cross sections to the unit loss prediction eq .",
    "( [ eq : klossin ] ) . rather than",
    "immediately employ the full number of open channels @xmath4 for this case ( which is technically challenging even within our simplified model ) , we emphasize the trend for ever - larger @xmath4 .",
    "thus the solid black line shows an exemplary cross section for only @xmath68 open channels . in this case",
    "ericson fluctuations occur on a sub-@xmath0k scale and are seen in the spectrum .",
    "however , even increasing the number of open channels to @xmath69 ( red line ) almost completely washes out these fluctuations .",
    "moreover , this result shows almost perfect agreement with the simple model in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : klossin ] ) .",
    "we find similar good agreement for different realizations of the statistical spectrum .",
    "we conclude from this result that the realistic @xmath4 , which is much larger still , will certainly lead to a featureless loss spectrum given by eqn .",

    "for collisions of alkali - metal dimer molecules , we have found that the density of ro - vibrational states is enormous , far too large to probe individual resonances even at the sub-@xmath0kelvin energy resolution afforded by ultracold temperatures .",
    "because of this circumstance , resonant collision rates are always averaged over many resonances , and the theoretical description of scattering is greatly simplified . thus broad general conclusions can be drawn .",
    "for the case of chemically reactive molecules , the formation of a resonant state ensures that the atoms have ample opportunity to find their way into the product channels , at least for reactions that are assumed to be barrierless .",
    "this in turn leads to essentially unit probability of reaction in each collision event , consistent with interpretations of recent experiments in ultracold krb gases .",
    "strikingly , even molecules that are _ not _ chemically reactive at zero temperature , in the presence of this vast number of resonances , behave _ as if _ they were chemically reactive , at least transiently .",
    "these molecules are capable of sticking together for a finite lifetime , which is dependent on the density of states .",
    "the longer this lifetime is , the more likely that the molecules bound in resonant complexes will be struck by other molecules and lost .",
    "contrary to expectation , it may therefore be necessary to shield even non - reactive molecules from collisions by confining them to 1d lattices and immersing them in electric fields @xcite .",
    "a main quantitative uncertainty in the results described here is whether the full density of ro - vibrational states is actually populated in a collision , which may not be the case @xcite .",
    "if it is not , then the time during which the molecules are stuck together reduces , and the loss rates may not be as great",
    ". thus measurements of loss may provide direct insight into the four - body dynamics of the molecule - molecule complex .",
