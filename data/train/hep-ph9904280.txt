    "<S> we also make the following general observations about the predicted asymmetry :    * as a consequence of the differing signatures for the pomeron and odderon , there is no interference between the two exchanges if they have the same power @xmath67 since then @xmath68=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in a perturbative calculation at tree - level the interference would be zero in the high - energy limit @xmath9 since the two- and three - gluon exchanges are purely imaginary and real respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the asymmetry is in the qed case proportional to the opening angle such that it vanishes in the limit @xmath9 . * in general </S>",
    "<S> , photon exchange will also contribute to the asymmetry since the photon and the odderon have the same quantum numbers . </S>",

    "<S> i.e. _ assuming a helicity preserving local interaction . </S>",

    "<S> in addition we will also assume @xmath104 , in analogy to the couplings which occur in the higher order corrections to bethe - heitler pair production  @xcite , and use the maximal odderon - proton coupling , @xmath105 , which follows from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : asym ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the asymmetry can be integrated over @xmath54 giving @xmath113    it should be emphasized that the magnitude of this estimate is quite uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> the odderon coupling to the proton which we are using is a maximal coupling for the soft odderon in relation to the soft pomeron . </S>",

    "<S> for the hard pomeron the coupling is in general different at the two vertices ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and this could also be true for the hard odderon .    there is also a small irreducible asymmetry from photon - pomeron interference . adding the photon exchange amplitude to the odderon amplitude modifies the asymmetry as follows ( again only taking into account the dirac form - factor ) , @xmath114 } { \\pi ( \\delta_{{\\cal o}}+\\alpha_{{\\cal o}}^\\prime t ) } + \\frac{1}{3 } \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{e^2}{t } \\cos \\frac{\\pi\\alpha_{{\\cal p}}}{2 }   \\right\\ } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 has been used to expand the pole - factor for the odderon , @xmath116 , for small @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> note that if @xmath117 then the odderon amplitude appears to have a @xmath118 pole just as photon exchange . </S>",
    "<S> however this pole must be screened by an effective mass for the corresponding 3-gluon state . </S>",
    "<S> the extra factor @xmath119 for photon exchange reflects the relative factor of @xmath120 for the pomeron / odderon couplings to the proton  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the soft pomeron - proton coupling  @xcite to estimate @xmath121 gev@xmath122 gives the minimal asymmetry from photon - pomeron interference ( neglecting the odderon contribution ) , @xmath123 where we again have used @xmath111 and @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for very small @xmath4 the photon - pomeron interference can be sizeable , but for larger @xmath4 it is presumably negligible compared to odderon - pomeron interference .    in specific models , such as diquark clustering in the proton  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the odderon coupling to the proton in diffractive dissociation is expected to be larger . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scenario the asymmetry from odderon - pomeron interference will be correspondingly larger for proton dissociation .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary we have presented a sensitive test for detecting the separate existence of the pomeron and the odderon exchange contributions in the high - energy limit @xmath9 as predicted by qcd . by observing the charge asymmetry of the quark / antiquark energy fraction ( @xmath54 ) in diffractive @xmath22 pair photoproduction </S>",
    "<S> , the interference between the pomeron and the odderon exchanges can be isolated , and the ratio to the sum of the pomeron and the odderon exchanges can be measured . using a model with helicity conserving coupling for the pomeron / odderon to quarks , </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry is predicted to be proportional to @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the asymmetry is estimated to be of order 15% . </S>",
    "<S> however , this estimate includes several unknowns and is thus quite uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> such a test could be performed by current experiments at hera and possibly compass measuring the diffractive production of open charm in photoproduction or electroproduction . </S>",
    "<S> such measurements could provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of the odderon , as well as the relative strength of the odderon and pomeron couplings . </S>",
    "<S> most important , the energy dependence of the asymmetry can be used to determine whether the odderon intercept is in fact greater or less than that of the pomeron . </S>"
