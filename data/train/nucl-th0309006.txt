    "the periodic orbit theory ( pot ) , initiated over 30 years ago by gutzwiller,@xcite is a semiclassical approach in which the level density of a quantum system is approximated in terms of the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system through the so - called ` trace formula ' .",
    "it has provided a great stimulus to the research area of quantum chaos,@xcite but is also applicable to integrable and nearly integrable systems.@xcite although originally developed to describe the motion of a particle bound in a given external potential or an ideally reflecting boundary ( a so - called ` quantum billiard ' ) , the pot can also be applied to describe the quantum oscillations ( shell - corrections ) in many - fermion systems within the mean - field approximation.@xcite for a general introduction to the pot and its applications in nuclear , mesoscopic and nanostructure physics , we refer to a recent text book.@xcite    an early application to nuclear physics consisted in a successful semiclassical explanation of the systematics of ground - state deformations.@xcite ( a corresponding investigation was recently carried out also for metal clusters.@xcite ) the onset of the mass asymmetry in the fission of actinide nuclei could also be explained semiclassically.@xcite fig .",
    "[ fiss ] shows the shell - correction energy around the outer fission barrier of @xmath0pu , plotted versus the elongation parameter @xmath1 and the mass asymmetry parameter @xmath2 . the 3d plot to the left and the contour plots to the extreme right were obtained within the pot in terms of the ( few ) shortest periodic orbits , modeling the nucleus by axially symmetric cavities ( see shapes to the extreme left),@xcite whereas the contour plots next to the right are the old quantum - mechanical results using realistic deformed nuclear shell - model potentials.@xcite    we can see that , in spite of the simplicity of the cavity model ( with only one kind of nucleons , neglecting pairing and spin - orbit interactions ) , the semiclassical calculation reproduces almost quantitatively the correct topology of the deformation energy surface and , in particular , predicts correctly the mass - asymmetric adiabatic fission path .",
    "the latter , indicated by the white dotted line , is simply given by the principle of stationary action of the shortest periodic orbits .",
    "the wavefunctions of the single - particle states , which are quantum - mechanically responsible for the lowering of the barrier due to the asymmetry , were found to have their maxima exactly in the planes containing the shortest periodic orbits that dominate the asymmetry effect semiclassically.@xcite    that the classical motion of the nucleons at these deformations is almost chaotic can be seen in fig .",
    "[ poinc ] . here",
    "we show poincar surfaces of section , obtained for angular momentum @xmath3 , taken at the symmetric outer barrier ( left ) and at the asymmetric saddle ( right ) ; the corresponding shapes with the planes containing the shortest periodic orbits are shown on top of each plot .",
    "the regular motion is confined to small islands , containing the relevant periodic orbits , surrounded by a chaotic sea .",
    "note that the energetically favored asymmetric shape has much smaller regular islands than the symmetric shape . nevertheless , the shell effect coming from these small regular regions of the classical dynamics is sufficiently strong to cause the collective asymmetry effect of the system .",
    "this example illustrates the strength of the semiclassical theory in explaining qualitatively ( and , at times , even semi - quantitatively ) important quantum effects , both in one - body and in many - body systems , in terms of classical dynamics .",
    "one aspect has , however , been neglected so far in the applications of the pot to nuclei : the spin of the nucleons . we know",
    "well that the spin - orbit interaction dramatically modifies the shell effects  that is , after all , why it had to be introduced to make the nuclear shell model work in the first place.@xcite in the semiclassical calculations of the refs.@xcite the neglect of the spin - orbit interaction was compensated by a simple readjustment of the fermi energy , allowing one to locally reproduce the correct shell situations ( or magic numbers ) .",
    "but this was only a temporary remedy , and a more rigorous semiclassical treatment of the spin - orbit interaction clearly remains highly desirable .",
    "the remainder of this paper is therefore devoted to some recent developments of the inclusion of spin degrees of freedom into the pot , which is by no means trivial since there is no classical analogon of the spin .",

    "[ orbits ] and [ levden ] suggests that the eps approach has a good potential for a general semiclassical theory with spin .",

    "it would therefore be desirable to use it as a formal starting point for further approximations .",
    "indeed , in the limit of a weak spin - orbit coupling such that @xmath72 , the wcl trace formula of ref.@xcite could be rigorously derived from the eps approach.@xcite hereby the equations of motion of the orbital and spin degrees of freedom were decoupled , and the effects of @xmath73 were included in the phases of the trace formula in first - order perturbation theory.@xcite pushing this treatment to second order , along the lines proposed in ref.@xcite for spin - independent systems , might allow one to extend the wcl trace formula , so that it becomes valid for larger values of @xmath8 while still benefitting from a simpler determination of the periodic orbits .",
