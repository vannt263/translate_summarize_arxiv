    "@xcite , a single vortex state or a state of several hundreds of vortices have been successfully created . theoretically , the behaviors of the rapid rotating bec systems are usually studied based on the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation @xcite . when angular velocity is greater than the radial trap oscillator frequency , @xmath5 , the system becomes unstable due to the ineffectiveness of confinement .    in the experiment of bretin _ et . al _",
    "@xcite , a quartic trapping potential has been successfully created .",
    "several groups then consider the type of trap potential @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the atom mass , @xmath8 is the strength of the quartic potential , and @xmath9 @xcite . with this quartic potential , due to the effect of strong confinement ,",
    "one thus can study the rotating bose condensates at higher angular velocities , @xmath10 .",
    "it is understood that the centrifugal force , varying as @xmath11 , can always be compensated by the trapping force varying as @xmath12 .",
    "rotating becs have also been studied under an anisotropic harmonic trap for a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) system @xcite . moreover , by manipulating the anisotropic trap frequencies associated with the rotating velocity , quasi-2d rotating bec under the anisotropic harmonic trap can be reduced to the limit of extreme elongation @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have studied the roton - maxon excitation spectrum in a rapid rotating weakly interacting bec under extreme elongation in a 2d anisotropic harmonic trap .",
    "when the interaction or the angular velocity increases , the system could undergo a second - order quantum transition to a state of a periodic structure  rows of vortices @xcite .",
    "similar transitions have also been investigated in refs .",
    "a common finding is that the larger the interaction or angular velocity is , the more the vortex lattice row number is .",
    "inspired by the works mentioned above @xcite , it is of particular interest to study how the rapid rotating bec behaves under the extreme elongation if a quartic trapping potential is added . with this goal , this paper considers the following effective 2d trap potential @xmath13+{1\\over 4}ux^4 , \\label{eq : mainpotential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , with the strength @xmath8 , the anharmonic quartic potential acts on the @xmath14-axis only . by adding the quartic potential along the @xmath14 axis only",
    ", the effect of the anharmonic trap for the extreme elongated system can be seen in a more transparent way ( effective 1d problem ) .",
    "in fact , the kind of effective trap ( [ eq : mainpotential ] ) can be realized in a realistic experiment .",
    "one can consider a quasi-2d system that is confined in the @xmath15 plane by a harmonic trap of relatively large @xmath16 .",
    "now , consider that an extra isotropic 2d quartic trap , @xmath17 , is added and suppose that the rotating angular frequency is purely along the @xmath18 direction .",
    "since the system is already confined in the @xmath15 plane , any quartic trap effect in the @xmath18 direction will simply enhance the confinement of the system in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "this means effectively , @xmath19 .    with the quartic trapping potential ( [ eq : mainpotential ] )",
    "which is introduced to stabilize the system against decay at higher rotation velocities ( @xmath4 ) , one can then study the system even for @xmath20 .",
    "it will be shown that in the limit of no interaction , ground state forms no vortex lattice at smaller @xmath4 and when @xmath4 becomes larger , one row of vortex lattice will form .",
    "vortex lattice will melt eventually at some larger @xmath4 .",
    "when the interaction is turned on , melting of the vortex lattice at some higher @xmath4 is also found .",
    "nevertheless , rich transition states occur for the vortex lattices .",
    "the transition states , arising due to the instability at a critical interaction strength or a critical rotation velocity , were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in an elongated system without the quartic potential .",
    "one will see that a similar instability leading to the formation of a periodic structure of vortex rows occurs in the current context . of most interest , a parameter labeled by @xmath21 which corresponds to number of terms involved in the @xmath22-sum of the wavefunction",

    "it means that when @xmath4 is large enough , transition states , which arise due to the effect of @xmath3 , will disappear . as an extreme example shown in fig .",
