    ", the spectrum of antiprotons has a unique shape distinguishing it from other cosmic - ray species : it is expected to peak at about 2 gev decreasing sharply towards lower energies . in addition to secondary antiprotons there are possible sources of primary antiprotons such as candidate dark matter particles and evaporating black holes .    despite numerous efforts and overall agreement on the secondary nature of the majority of cr antiprotons , published estimates of the expected flux significantly differ ( see e.g.  fig .",

    "the major sources of uncertainties are : ( i ) incomplete knowledge of cross sections for antiproton production , annihilation , and scattering , ( ii ) parameters and models of particle propagation in the galaxy , and ( iii ) modulation in the heliosphere .",
    "while the interstellar antiproton flux is affected only by uncertainties in the cross sections and propagation models , the final comparison with experiment can only be made after correcting for the solar modulation .",
    "besides , the spectra of cr nucleons have been directly measured only inside the heliosphere while we need to know the spectrum outside in interstellar space to compute the antiproton production rate correctly .    we have developed a numerical method and corresponding computer code galprop for the calculation of galactic cr propagation in 3d @xcite .",
    "the code has been shown to reproduce simultaneously observational data of many kinds related to cr origin and propagation @xcite .",
    "the code has been validated on direct measurements of nuclei , antiprotons , electrons , and positrons , and astronomical measurements of  and synchrotron radiation .",
    "these data provide many independent constraints on model parameters .    here",

    "the `` tertiary '' antiprotons ( inelastically scattered secondaries ) , significant at the lowest energies , are important in interstellar space , but make no difference when compared with measurements in the heliosphere .    to investigate the range of interstellar spectra and propagation parameters we considered four basic models ( table [ table1 ] ) .",

    "however , this model produces a bump in proton and he spectra at @xmath23 gev / nucleon which is not observed .",
    "this bump can be removed by choosing an injection spectrum that hardens at low energies @xcite .",

    "it reproduces all the particle data `` on average '' , although it has still some problem with the reproduction of the sharp peak in b / c ratio . in this model a flattening of the diffusion coefficient below 4 gv is required to match the b / c ratio at low energies .    to better match primaries ( @xmath27",
    ", he ) in the dc model , we introduced a steeper injection spectrum below 20 gv ; such a break , however , has almost no effect on secondaries ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the existence of a sharp upturn below a few gev / nucleon follows from snr shock acceleration theory @xcite ; this is a transition region between thermal and non - thermal particle populations in the shock .",
    "our model does not require a sharp break ( 0.3 in index is enough ) .",
    "we use the dc model to calculate the lis spectra of protons and antiprotons and then use the drift model to determine their modulated spectra and ratio over the solar cycles with positive ( @xmath30 ) and negative ( @xmath31 ) polarity ( figs .",

    "it may be also used to test the theory of heliospheric modulation @xcite .",
    "it appears quite difficult to get agreement with b / c , p & he spectra , and antiprotons spectrum simultaneously in the framework of simple `` physical '' reacceleration / convection models ; this conclusion is mainly the result of the increased precision of the cr experimental data , and also the improved reliability of the calculations .          what could be the origin of this failure , apart from the propagation models ? for b / c",
    ", it seems unlikely that the cross - sections are sigificantly in error since for b production from c and o they are well measured at the relevant energies . for @xmath27 and he the gev bump produced by reacceleration seems to be outside the limits allowed by the modulation models and the observed fluxes , although the uncertainties in modulation are still considerable .",
    "such a bump in the spectra of primaries ( @xmath27 , he , @xmath32 ) could be `` removed '' by including a flattening of the injection spectrum at low energies , while for secondaries ( @xmath29 , @xmath28 ) we have no such freedom and the problem remains .",
    "if we assume then that the problem is in the propagation models , we have shown that it _ is _ possible to construct a model ( dc ) which fits all these data , by postulating a significant flattening of the diffusion coefficient below 4 gv together with convection ( and possibly with reduced reacceleration ) .",
    "this type of break in the diffusion coefficient is reminiscent of the standard procedure in `` leaky - box '' models where the escape time is set to a constant below a few gev .",
    "this has always appeared a completely _ ad hoc _ device without physical justification , but the present analysis suggest it may be forced on us by these type of data , so that possibilities for its physical origin should be studied . at the same time",
    "the sensitivity of the whole analysis to the modulation models has to be investigated further .",
