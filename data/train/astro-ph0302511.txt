    "the determination of the disk stellar luminosity function ( lf ) and mass function ( mf ) in the low - mass star ( @xmath4 ) domain is still subject to debate and remains up to date an unsettled issue .",
    "the disagreement between the mf inferred from the photometric hst lf and from the nearby 5.2-pc lf has been a controversial issue since the gould , bahcall & flynn ( 1997 ; gbf97 ) paper .",
    "the mf derived from the local sample keeps rising , although moderately , down to the hydrogen burning limit , whereas the mf derived from the hst lf is steadily decreasing from @xmath5 down to @xmath6 ( see figure 1 of mra , chabrier and schaeffer 1998 ) .",
    "the question is of prime importance for various reasons .",
    "first , the determination of the very shape of the mf bears profound consequences for our understanding of star formation .",
    "second , whereas the luminosity of galaxies arises mostly from stars from about 1 to a few solar masses , most of their mass is contained in objects with @xmath7 .",
    "the determination of the mf in the m - dwarf regime is thus crucial for a proper evaluation of their mass budget and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "third , the normalization of the mf near the hydrogen burning limit is the cornerstone for an accurate evaluation of the brown dwarf ( bd ) content of the disk .",
    "last but not least , the m - dwarf present - day mf ( pdmf ) represents the _ initial _ mf ( imf ) of the galaxy , i.e. is representative of the mass distribution of the stars _ ever _ formed in the galaxy ( scalo 1986 ) , a central input in galactic evolution and cosmic star formation history .",
    "the unresolved discrepancy between the hst and nearby mf determinations thus prevents robust determinations of the aforementioned quantities . in this letter",
    ", we reconsider this problem in the light of the recently reanalyzed hst lf ( zheng et al .",
    "the lf @xmath8 requires the determination of the distance of the objects . samples with trigonometric parallax determination require near distances from the sun and define the so - called _ nearby _ lf @xmath9 .",
    "a major advantage of @xmath9 is the identification of binary systems .",
    "a v - band nearby lf can be derived by combining hipparcos parallax data ( esa 1997 ) for @xmath10 and the sample of nearby stars with ground - based parallaxes ( dahn , liebert & harington 1986 ) for @xmath11 to a completeness distance r=5.2 pc . on the other hand ,",
    "henry & mcarthy ( 1990 ) used speckle interferometry to resolve companions of every known m dwarf within 5 pc and obtained the complete m dwarf lf @xmath9 in the h and k band .",
    "their sample recovers the dahn et al .",
    "( 1986 ) one , plus one previously unresolved companion ( gl 866b ) . up to now",
    ", samples extended to a larger volume remain incomplete ( see henry et al . 1997 ) and are hampered by ill - determined distances ( see chabrier 2001 , ",
    "3 ) .    kroupa ( 2001 ) and chabrier ( 2001 ) have determined the galactic disk m - dwarf mf from the v - band 5-pc @xmath9 , although using different functional forms .",
    "we have redone this analysis , by calculating the mf from both the aforementioned v - band and k - band @xmath9 .",
    "recently , delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sgransan et al .",
    "( 2002a ) combined adaptative optics and accurate radial velocities to determine the mass - magnitude relation of about 20 objects between @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath0 in the v , j , h and k bands with mass accuracies of 0.2 to 5% .",
    "the mass - magnitude relationships ( mmr ) derived from the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ; bcah98 ) models reproduce these data within less than 1-@xmath14 in the j , h and k bands ( figure 3 of delfosse et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the agreement is less good in the v band , with a systematic offset of a few tenths of a magnitude below @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , as discussed at length in bcah98 and chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 , figure 1 ) .",
    "the implications for the mf have been examined in detail by chabrier ( 2001 , figures 1 and 2 ) and have been found to remain modest ( @xmath17 in the mass determination for @xmath180.2 - 0.3 @xmath0 ) .",
    "the theoretical m - dwarf radii of bach98 also agree within 1% or less for @xmath19 with the radius measurements obtained recently with the vlti by sgransan et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "this establishes the validity of deriving the mfs from the observed lfs using the theoretical bcah98 mmrs .",
    "however , in order to avoid any possible source of error , the conversion of the v - band lf into a mf was done using the delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xmath20-@xmath21 relation , fitted to the data .",
    "these results are displayed in figure [ fig1_col.ps ] .",
    "we note the very good agreement between the two determinations , which establishes the consistency of the two observed samples , part of the @xmath21.5-@xmath14 difference in the mass range @xmath22 -0.5 to -0.6 reflecting most likely the remaining uncertainties in the mmr .",
    "as shown in chabrier ( 2002 ) , an imf including this bin extrapolated into the bd regime would overestimate significantly the number of such objects . ] .",
    "the solid line displays a lognormal form which gives a fairly good representation of the results :    @xmath23    with the same normalization as scalo ( 1986 ) at 1 @xmath0 , @xmath24 , above which the pdmf and the imf start to differ appreciably ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this imf is very similar to the imf2 derived in chabrier ( 2001 ) , which gives a good description of the star counts in the deep field of the eso imaging survey ( eis ) ( groenewegen et al .",
    "2002 ) and whose predictions in the bd domain agree fairly well with present detections of various field surveys ( chabrier 2002 ) .",
    "as demonstrated by the detailed study of kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) and kroupa ( 1995 ) , most of the discrepancy between photometric and nearby lfs for @xmath26 results from malmquist bias and unresolved binary systems in the low - spatial resolution photographic surveys .",
    "although the malmquist bias is negligible for the hst , this latter , however , misses essentially all companions of multiple systems , because of its angular resolution .",
    "gbf97 estimate that the correction arising from unresolved companions is at most a factor of 2 at @xmath27 , whereas the difference between the hst ( gbf97 ) mf and the one derived from @xmath9 is more than a factor of 4 in this region ( see e.g. figure 1 of mra et al . 1998 or figure [ fig2_col.ps ] below , empty triangles ) .",
    "clearly , the binary correction can not account _ by itself _ for the difference . a major caveat of any photometric lf , however , is that the determination of the distance relies on a photometric determination from a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the former analysis of the hst data ( gbf97 ) used for the entire sample a color - magnitude transformation characteristic of stars with solar abundances . as shown in figure 2 of zheng et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , however , the vast majority of the stars in the hst sample lie at a galactic height @xmath28 800 pc above the plane .",
    "these stars are expected to have metal - depleted abundances and fainter magnitudes for a given v - i color than stars with solar abundance ( chabrier & baraffe 2000 ) . assuming a solar abundance for the entire hst sample thus results in an overestimation of the distance and an underestimation of the number density .",
    "this point was considered recently in the new analysis and sample of zheng et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , yielding a revised @xmath29 , with indeed a larger number of m dwarfs at dim absolute magnitudes . this new sample , however , does not include the correction due to unresolved binaries and the inferred imf still differs significantly from the one derived from the local sample .",
    "we have conducted a detailed analysis of this bias with this new lf .",
    "although the multiplicity rate for _ stellar _ companions of m dwarfs still remains ill - determined , a reasonable estimate is starting to emerge , with a value @xmath30 % ( marchal et al .",
    "2002 ) . mass ratios of binaries have been determined accurately only for f and g stars ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; dm91 ) .",
    "similar m - dwarf studies are in progress ( delfosse et al .",
    "1999 ; marchal et al .",
    "2002 ) , but extended observations ( @xmath2 10 years ) are required to get unbiased results .",
    "the studies conducted by mazeh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , restricted to short period binaries , give a linear fit of mass - ratio distribution whose slope is compatible with 0 , the uncertainty being large .",
    "the recent determinations by marchal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) point to a mass ratio close to unity for short period binaries ( @xmath31 d ) , but a distribution compatible with a dm91 or a uniform one for longer periods .",
    "we have conducted monte carlo simulations in order to estimate the effect of such unresolved binaries on the local and hst mf .",
    "the mass of the single stars and primaries @xmath32 is drawn randomly according to mf ( eq . [ [ imfdisk ] ] ) .",
    "a fraction @xmath33 of these stars are then selected with a uniform probability distribution and are attributed a companion .",
    "the mass of the companion is drawn from a mass fraction distribution @xmath34 ( @xmath35=@xmath36 ) , assuming this distribution does not depend on the mass of the primary . in order to estimate the dependence of the binary correction upon the parameters , we have conducted calculations with several binary fractions and mass - ratio distributions , namely @xmath34=constant , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these distributions correspond to a uniform mass - ratio distribution , a dm91 distribution for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and distributions biased towards equal masses and low mass ratio , respectively . the resulting distribution @xmath42 , i.e. the total number of stars @xmath43 over the number of primaries increases with decreasing mass approximately as @xmath44 from @xmath45 to 0.1@xmath46 , with a maximum of @xmath47 at @xmath48 , for @xmath49 .",
    "the shape of the correction is found to depend only weakly on the @xmath34 distribution .",
    "notice that these distributions imply that a fraction of the companions are below the h - burning limit ( @xmath50 ) . for the sample studied by dm91 ,",
    "about 60% of the observed stars have a companion of mass larger than 0.1 @xmath0 and the dm91 distribution predicts @xmath210% of sub - stellar companions .",
    "if the same distribution is applied to a 0.2 @xmath0 m dwarf , then about 50% of the companions are bds .",
    "this means that the observed _ frequency _ of _ stellar _ binaries depends on the mass of the primary . in a sample",
    "including stellar objects only , the present calculations predict an _ observable _ ( stellar ) fraction of companions @xmath2 60% among m - dwarf primaries , the remaining @xmath2 40% fraction being bd companions . for a @xmath5150% binary frequency ( see below ) , this implies @xmath52 of m - dwarf m - dwarf systems , and @xmath53 of systems composed of an m dwarf with a bd companion .",
    "this is in good agreement with the presently observed m dwarf binary fraction in the solar neighborhood ( delfosse et al .",
    "1999 ; marchal et al .",
    "2002 ) , and with the present estimates of bd companions of m dwarfs at large orbital separations ( gizis et al .",
    "the correction to the lf and to the mf is examined below .",
    "we first consider the effect of unresolved binaries on the mf derived from the nearby lf @xmath9 .",
    "for that , we have merged the identified companions in the dahn et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and henry & mccarthy ( 1990 ) samples into unresolved systems .",
    "this yields the nearby _ system _ lf , from which we have calculated the _ system _ mf , following the same procedure as in  2 .",
    "figure [ fig2_col.ps ] displays this system mf , as well as the recent hst mf ( table 4 of zheng et al .",
    "the two mfs are compatible at the @xmath54 level . for comparison",
    ", the figure displays also the hst mf obtained from a color - magnitude distance determination assuming that all the objects have a solar abundance , as done in gbf97 ( zheng et al .",
    "2001 , figure 4 with their cmr(1 ) ) .",
    "this latter is much more difficult to reconcile with the local system mf below @xmath55 , as mentioned earlier .",
    "for further purposes , it is interesting to parametrize this _ system _ mf , as done in equation [ [ imfdisk ] ] for the single objects , as :    @xmath56    with the same normalization as mf ( eq . [ [ imfdisk ] ] ) at 1 @xmath0 , where the binary correction is negligible .",
    "it is displayed by the solid line in figure [ fig2_col.ps ] .    in order to verify this correction due to unresolved binaries on the local lf @xmath9",
    ", we have applied the same type of monte carlo simulations as described above . however , in the present case , we have explored the possibility that the primary and the secondary are drawn randomly from the _ same _ single object mf ( eq . [ [ imfdisk ] ] ) .",
    "the _ system _",
    "lf is then calculated by attributing a magnitude @xmath57 $ ] to the unresolved binary and the system mf is derived with the same mmrs as in  2 .",
    "the resulting system mf is displayed in figure [ fig3_col.ps ] for a binary fraction @xmath58 ( solid line ) and @xmath59 ( dash line ) . as seen in the figure",
    ", the agreement with the observed local system mf is excellent , and the system mf for @xmath58 agrees surprisingly well with the parametrized form ( eq . [ [ imfsys ] ] ) .",
    "the quantification of the effect of unresolved binaries on the hst mf is more complicated , for in that case the galactic scale height variation must be taken into account .",
    "we use the same monte - carlo calculations , with the disk density profile @xmath60 determined by zheng et al .",
    "( 2001 , eq . [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we then proceed exactly as for the local lf , with a simulated stellar population , including @xmath61 binary systems , drawn randomly from this spatial distribution , with masses given by equation [ [ imfdisk ] ] .",
    "we use the same @xmath21-@xmath62 relation and color cut 1.53@xmath634.63 as zheng et al .",
    "we then reconstruct the hst observed lf obtained with the @xmath64 method ( @xmath65 ) , assuming all binary systems unresolved .",
    "the reconstructed mf from this system lf is compared to the one derived by zheng et al .",
    "( 2001 , squares ) on figure ( [ fig3_col.ps ] ) for @xmath58 ( dash - dot line ) .",
    "the hst data have been multiplied by a factor @xmath66 to bring the hst normalization at 0.6 @xmath0 into consistency with the one inferred from equation [ [ imfdisk ] ] ( see zheng et al .",
    "2001 ,  3.3 ) .",
    "the simulated hst mf including the effect of unresolved companions is consistent at the @xmath67 level with the observed one , the remaining discrepancy arising most likely from the mmr metallicity - dependent correction used in the hst sample analysis or from incompleteness of this sample at dim magnitudes .",
    "surprisingly , the main difference between the reconstructed hst system mf and the local system mf ( eq.[[imfsys ] ] ) occurs for the larger masses ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the reason is the malmquist bias in the @xmath69 method used in the present simulations and in gbf97 due to the saturation threshold of the hst camera , @xmath70 , which excludes a non negligible fraction of the simulated stars .",
    "this bias , however , is corrected in the maximum likelihood analysis done by zheng et al .",
    "the simulations for the _ volume_-limited local sample are not affected by this bias and yield agreement between the simulated and system mf ( [ imfsys ] ) over the entire considered mass range .",
    "in this letter , we have derived the single and systemic mfs for the galactic disk in the m - dwarf regime , from both the v and k - band local lfs .",
    "both determinations are well reproduced by a lognormal form , normalized at 1 @xmath0 on the value derived by scalo ( 1986 ) .",
    "we have shown that the disk stellar mf determined from either the nearby parallax lf or the hst photometric lf are consistent , and that the previous source of disagreement was due to _ two _ cumulative effects , namely ( i ) incorrect color - magnitude determined distances in the original lf derived by gbf97 , due to the fact that a large fraction of the hst m - dwarf sample belongs to a metal - depleted population high above the galactic plane , a point corrected in the recent analysis of zheng et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and ( ii ) unresolved binaries in the hst sample .",
    "we have shown that the hst mf is very similar to the local _ system _ mf .",
    "this latter is consistent with a fraction @xmath7150% of binaries , with masses for the primary and the companions determined by the same underlying aforementioned single mf .",
    "this yields roughly equal fractions of m - dwarf m - dwarf and m - dwarf bd systems , in agreement with present observations .",
    "these results yield a reinterpretation of the so - called `` brown - dwarf desert '' .",
    "this latter , expressing the deficit of small - separation bd companions to solar - type stars , as compared with stellar or planetary companions , has sometimes been interpreted as an imf of substellar companions to solar - type stars significantly different from the one determined for the field .",
    "the present calculations , however , show that this `` desert '' should be reinterpreted as a lack of high mass - ratio ( @xmath72 ) systems , and does not preclude a substantial fraction of bds as companions of m dwarfs or other bds .",
    "moreover , bd companions of stars , i.e. systems with large mass - ratio , may form preferentially at large separations , requiring long time basis for detection , as suggested by the recent analysis of marchal et al .",
    "the present calculations and the ones developed in chabrier ( 2001 , 2002 ) suggest that stars , bds and companions originate from the same universal imf ( eq . [ [ imfdisk ] ] ) .",
