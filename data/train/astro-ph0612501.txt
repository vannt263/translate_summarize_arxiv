    "the soft x  ray source  belongs to a small group of seven nearby , isolated neutron stars discovered with the rosat satellite and often dubbed x  ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins , see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these sources are characterized by thermal spectra with blackbody temperature in the range 40110 ev , x  ray luminosity of 10@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath1 , faint optical counterparts ( v@xmath625 ) , and absence of radio emission . the initial suggestion that xdins could be powered by accretion from the interstellar medium",
    "@xcite has been ruled out by the measurement , in three of them , of large proper motions that imply an accretion rate far too small to power the observed luminosity ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "pulsations have been found in five ( or possibly six ) xdins , with periods in the 312 s range , pulsed fractions between 4% and 18% , and , in two cases , period derivatives of the order of 10@xmath7 s s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these spin - down values yield characteristic ages of @xmath312 myrs , spin - down luminosities of 45@xmath810@xmath4 erg s@xmath1 , and , with the canonical dipole radiation braking assumptions , magnetic fields of a few 10@xmath9 g. it is thus believed that the x  ray emission in xdins is powered by the neutron star cooling .    received particular interest since it is the brightest xdin , its x  ray flux does not show any apparent contamination from non thermal magnetospheric emission , and a parallactic distance ( 117@xmath1012 pc ) has been reported @xcite .",
    "these properties make  an ideal target to derive information on the neutron star radius and thus constrain the equation of state of matter at super nuclear density through a detailed modelling of its surface thermal emission .",
    "quite surprisingly , even the x  ray spectra with the highest resolution and the best statistics , obtained in long chandra and xmm - newton observations , do not show any line feature and can be fit by a simple planckian with temperature kt=63 ev @xcite .    despite extensive searches ,",
    "no pulsations have ever been detected in  @xcite .",
    "the tight upper limits on the pulsed fraction ( @xmath111.3% at 2@xmath12 ) obtained for periods between 0.02 and 1000 s @xcite , led to the speculation that  could be a millisecond pulsar , not yet seen to pulsate owing to the reduced sensitivity for short periods of the observations carried out up to now .",
    "recently , an upper limit on the pulsed fraction of 2.1% ( at 1@xmath12 ) was reported for periods in the range 1 - 20 ms @xcite . here",
    "we report the discovery of pulsations at 7 seconds , obtained thanks to the very high counting statistics provided by the most recent xmm - newton observation of .",
    "a 70 ks long observation of  was carried out with the xmm - newton satellite starting on 2006 october 24 at 00:30 ut .",
    "we used the data of the epic instrument ( 0.1 - 12 kev ) , consisting of two mos and one pn cameras @xcite .",
    "all the cameras mounted the thin filter and were operated in small window mode , yielding time resolutions of 6 ms and 0.3 s for the pn and mos , respectively .",
    "we processed the data using version 7.0 of the _ xmm - newton science analysis system _ ; the event files were created using the tasks _ epproc _ and _ emproc _ with default options and filtered to exclude the time intervals of high particle background , resulting in net ( dead - time corrected ) exposure times of 47 ks and 68 ks for the pn and mos , respectively .",
    "we started the timing analysis using the data of the pn camera and selecting the energy range 0.15 - 1.2 kev . due to the very soft spectrum of , practically no source photons",
    "are detected at higher energies .",
    "we used a circular extraction region centered at the source position and with radius 40@xmath13 .",
    "this resulted in @xmath3356,600 counts , of which @xmath32,700 can be ascribed to the background .",
    "the arrival times were corrected to the solar system barycenter . in order to search for periods of a few seconds , as seen in the other sources of this class , we rebinned the counts at @xmath30.278 s and computed the fourier power spectrum .",
    "a significant peak in the power spectrum was found at the frequency of 0.14174 hz .",
    "taking into account the number of searched periods ( 131072 ) , the peak value of 38.46 corresponds to a chance probability of 6@xmath14 . to better estimate the period",
    ", we used the epoch folding technique and fitted the peak in the @xmath15 versus trial period distribution as described in @xcite , obtaining p=7.05514@xmath100.00007 s. the corresponding folded light curve is shown in the top panel of fig .  1 .",
    "no significant differences in the pulse profiles were found by dividing the counts in soft and hard energy intervals .",
    "the phase averaged spectrum is well fit with absorbed blackbody parameters fully consistent with those of the previous xmm - newton observations of  @xcite .",
    "the pulsed fraction , derived by fitting a sinusoid to the background subtracted pn light curve , is ( 1.6@xmath100.2)% . this small pulsed fraction explains why the periodicity was not discovered in previous observations and is not significantly detected in the mos data .",
    "the two mos together collected only @xmath3137,900 counts from a 40@xmath13 radius extraction region , less than half of the pn ones .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the mos 0.15 - 1.2 kev folded light curve ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 ) is statistically consistent with a constant flux .",
    "in order to confirm the periodicity seen in the pn data of october 2006 , we analyzed the other xmm - newton observations listed in table 1 .",
    "after reducing the data as described above , we searched for the 7 s pulsations with the z@xmath16 test @xcite , which has a good sensitivity for sinusoidal signals . for each observation , we restricted our search to the range of periods obtained by a backward extrapolation from the current value , assuming a conservative period derivative @xmath17 s s@xmath1 . during the april 2004 observation the pn was in timing mode and the two mos were in full frame mode with a time resolution of only 2.6 s , that caused significant photon pile - up in the mos data",
    ". therefore we used only the pn data , selecting the energy range 0.28 - 1.2 kev in order to avoid the soft flares produced by high - energy particles in the pn timing mode @xcite .",
    "in all the other observations we used the sum of the 0.15 - 1.2 kev counts from the pn and the two mos .",
    "the distributions that we obtained for the z@xmath16 statistics are shown in fig .  2 , where it can be seen that a maximum of z@xmath16 is always present at the expected pulse period .",
    "to evaluate the statistical significance of these detections , we must take into account the number of periods searched in each observation .",
    "the most significant detection is that of april 2002 , where , considering the 335 independent periods in the considered range ( 6.987.13 s ) , the peak z@xmath16=32.22 corresponds to a chance probability of 335@xmath18= 3@xmath19 . in a similar way we derived the following chance probabilities for the other observations : 7@xmath19 ( april 2004 ) , 5@xmath14 ( september 2004 ) , 2@xmath20 ( september 2005 ) , and 2@xmath21 ( march 2006 ) .",
    "these values indicate that the periodicity is detected in all the observations , although sometimes with small z@xmath16 values , as expected for the case of a small pulsed fraction .",
    "the relatively low significance of the march 2006 detection , despite a number of counts and duration similar to the october 2006 observation , is not particularly surprising .",
    "in fact , with about half a million counts , a @xmath31% modulation has a probability of  10% of giving a z@xmath16 as small as the observed value of 15.5 @xcite .",
    "the best periods and pulsed fractions , determined in each observation as described above for the october 2006 data , are given in table  1 , while the folded light curves are presented in fig .",
    "although this figure seems to suggest some variations in the pulse profiles , we verified by means of a kolmogorov - smirnov test that , taking into account the unknown relative phase alignment , all the light curves are fully compatible with the same profile .",
    "we determined the relative phase shifts of the six observations by fitting sinusoidal functions to the folded light curves . after applying these shifts , we summed all the pn and mos data taken in small window mode to obtain the averaged light curves shown in fig .  4 for the total ( 0.15 - 1.2 kev ) , soft ( 0.15 - 0.26 kev ) and hard ( 0.26 - 1.2 kev ) energy ranges .",
    "the corresponding pulsed fractions are ( 1.17@xmath100.08)% , ( 0.88@xmath100.11)% , and ( 1.5@xmath100.11)% .    all the period measurements , spanning more than four years , are consistent with an average value of p=7.05515@xmath100.00004 s. with a linear fit to the period values we can limit the period derivative to @xmath22 s s@xmath1 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "we searched for the  pulsations also in the long chandra observation performed with the letg / hrc - s instrument in october 2001 .",
    "our search , based on about 91,600 counts extracted from the zero - order image , gave a negative result .",
    "this is not surprising , since for this number of counts and a @xmath31.2% pulsed fraction , the expectation value for the z@xmath16 statistics is only 6.6 .",
    "furthermore , the long time span of the observation yields an intrinsic frequency resolution a factor  10 better than that of the best xmm - newton observation .",
    "this means a tenfold increase in the number of statistically independent periods that have to be examined and thus a higher threshold for a significant detection .",
    "our discovery of the long sought periodicity in   and the upper limit derived for @xmath23 can be used to infer a characteristic age @xmath24 yr , a magnetic field b@xmath25 g , and a spin - down luminosity @xmath26 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "these values are fully consistent with those of the other six xdins .",
    "the pulsed fraction of  is significantly smaller than that of the other members of the group , which have pulsed fractions in the range from 4% to 18% .",
    "the xmm - newton data give also evidence for a pulsed fraction increasing as a function of the energy .",
    "the small pulsed fraction in  might simply result from geometrical orientation effects or by a particularly small gradient in the surface temperature distribution .",
    "detailed phase - resolved spectral modelling , that might discriminate between the different possibilities , will be reported elsewhere .",
    "here we simply note that the october 2006 pn spectra for the maximum and minimum of the folded light curve are both consistent with the best - fit absorbed blackbody model of the phase - averaged spectrum , simply re - scaled in normalization . letting all the fit parameters free to vary ,",
    "the maximum allowed difference in the temperatures of the two spectra is of kt@xmath27=1.2 ev ( at the 90% c.l . ) . repeating the same exercise for 5 phase bins ,",
    "we find again no significant spectral variations , with all the parameters within the following ranges : n@xmath28(48)@xmath810@xmath29 @xmath30 and kt@xmath27=61.463.2 ev .",
    "our results indicate that , except for the striking absence of deviations from a pure blackbody in its x  ray spectrum , shares most of the properties of the other members of the xdins group .",
    "more importantly , the discovery of pulsations opens the way for the determination of the timing - dependent parameters that are crucial for a more detailed modelling of the star s surface emission properties .    based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
