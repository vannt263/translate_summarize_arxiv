    "time reversal and inversion are two of the most important symmetries for the formation of cooper pairs in a superconductor .",
    "interesting new features of superconductivity arise when one or both of them are missing .",
    "one intriguing phase in the absence of time reversal symmetry is the so - called fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state - a spatially modulated superconducting condensate induced by the spin - splitting of the fermi surface due to high magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite this phase has been discussed in many contexts , for condensed matter systems  @xcite and ultra - cold atomic gases ,  @xcite as well as in nuclear physics .",
    "@xcite the other interesting class is represented by superconductors without inversion center in the crystal lattice .",
    "these so - called non - centrosymmetric superconductors are also characterized by spin - splitting of the fermi surface , in this case due to anti - symmetric spin - orbit coupling , and form cooper pairs of mixed parity .",
    "@xcite interestingly , both types of situations have been recently discussed in the context of ce - based heavy fermion superconductors . a phase observed in cecoin@xmath4 at low - temperatures and rather high magnetic fields",
    "is considered a possible candidate for an fflo state .",
    "@xcite most striking properties of unusually high upper critical fields have been reported for ceirsi@xmath5 and cerhsi@xmath5 which both have a non - centrosymmetric crystal lattice .",
    "@xcite in our study we would like to consider a combined effect of spin - splitting through magnetic fields and spin - orbit coupling in an artificially structured heavy fermion superconductor based on cecoin@xmath4 .",
    "mizukami and his coworkers succeeded recently in fabricating superlattices of cecoin@xmath4 and ybcoin@xmath4 , the former a heavy fermion and the latter an ordinary metal .",
    "@xcite surprisingly this system is superconducting , if the number of cecoin@xmath4 layers within a unit cell exceeds two . in view of the fact that the upper critical field remains amazingly high despite the low transition temperature ,",
    "@xcite the superconductivity in the superlattice is robust against paramagnetic depairing effect .",
    "it was proposed that the superstructure of this material would have locally non - centrosymmetric features while having global inversion centers and may lead to unusual properties of the superconducting phase .",
    "@xcite actually the multilayered structure would induce a spatially dependent rashba - type of spin - orbit coupling  @xcite which would influence the spin structure of the electronic bands and suppress the paramagnetic depairing effect .",
    "@xcite recent measurement of the angular variation of the upper critical field found evidence for such a behavior .",
    "@xcite in this study , we investigate an unusual form of the superconducting order parameter induced by the modulated rashba spin - orbit coupling in the magnetic field .",
    "as it will turn out to involve a modulation on the length scale of lattice constant , the phase may be viewed as a pair - density wave ( pdw ) state . here",
    "we will restrict to models of bi- and tri - layer systems as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .    .",
    "the structures of modulated rashba spin - orbit coupling and superconducting order parameters in bcs and pdw states are shown in the right hand side of each figure .",
    "see the text for details .",
    "[ fig : fig1],width=321 ]",
    "for our discussion we analyze the following model of a multilayered system having the inter - layer hopping and rashba spin - orbit coupling , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the index of layers .",
    "note that we restrict here to one set of superconducting layers and ignore the normal metal part of the superlattice , assuming that the coupling between heavy fermion and normal metal part is small .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the superlattice of cecoin@xmath4 , since the large mismatch in the fermi velocities between cecoin@xmath4 and ybcoin@xmath4 at the interface suppresses the proximity effect .",
    "@xcite for the band structure we assume a simple nearest - neighbor hopping tight binding form @xmath8 on a square lattice with the chemical potential @xmath9 , and a small inter - layer hopping @xmath10 . the symbol @xmath11 denotes the summation over nearest - neighbor layers .",
    "it is important to note that the following results do not qualitatively depend on the details of the band structure .",
    "we also use an @xmath12-wave superconducting state by assuming @xmath13 ( onsite attractive interaction ) for simplicity . although cecoin@xmath4 is believed to be a @xmath14-wave superconductor and",
    "would have a small odd - parity component admixed with the local non - centrosymmetricity , the features found below are independent of the pairing symmetry as long as spin - singlet pairing is predominant . in fact , we have confirmed that the model for @xmath14-wave superconductivity gives the qualitatively same results ( see appendix ) .",
    "hence , for the sake of numerical accuracy , we restrict ourselves to the simpler @xmath12-wave state .",
    "our choice @xmath15 gives rise to the critical temperature @xmath16 for both bi - layer and tri - layer systems with @xmath17 , ignoring phase fluctuations .",
    "for our purpose it is sufficient to choose a @xmath18-vector with rashba spin - orbit structure , @xmath19 without going into microscopic details of the compound .",
    "@xcite the coupling constants @xmath20 are layer dependent and antisymmetric with respect to reflection at the center of the multilayer structure . in this way the existence of a global inversion center is guaranteed .",
    "for example , @xmath21 for bi - layers , and @xmath22 for tri - layers ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "paramagnetic limiting and also eventually the pdw phase enter through the zeeman coupling term , i.e. the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) .    in our discussion",
    "we restrict to magnetic fields along _ c_-axis and analyze the model on the basis of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation . while we include the layer dependence of order parameter @xmath23 , we ignore the spatial modulation in the plane , such as the vortex state .",
    "this simplification is not crucial on a qualitative level , if we assume short coherence lengths and a large ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath24 , the ratio of coherence length and london penetration depth .",
    "although phase fluctuations may play an important role for the critical temperature , we focus on the low - temperature and high - magnetic field phase , and ignore this aspect .",
    "first , we address the results for the bi - layer system . figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the @xmath1-@xmath0 phase diagram for several values of @xmath25 .",

    "@xcite in this case the order parameter is the same in both layers having the same phase , @xmath27 .",
    "this state we call bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state is stabilized basically by the inter - layer `` josephson '' coupling .",
    "the superconducting phase transition turns first order at low temperatures , because of the paramagnetic depairing effect . the in - plane fflo phase with an inhomogeneous order parameter in the two - dimensional plane",
    "is supposed to appear around the first order transition line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "however , in our approach we ignore the possibility of in - plane modulations as mentioned above .",
    "we now turn to the role of the layer - dependent rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "interestingly , the order parameter configuration with a sign change , @xmath28 , becomes more stable at high magnetic fields for @xmath29 .",
    "this state is called the pair - density wave ( pdw ) state in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b - d ) , since the order parameter modulates on length scales of the crystal lattice constant .",
    "the pdw state was proposed for the @xmath30-phase in the bulk cecoin@xmath4 ,  @xcite but has not been established in microscopic models so far . with increasing the spin - orbit coupling @xmath31 the pdw state is stabilized in the large parameter range .",
    "thus , we here find that the pdw state may be realized in multilayer systems having `` weak inter - layer coupling '' and `` moderate spin - orbit coupling '' .",
    "we would like to stress that the pdw state is stabilized in the purely superconducting multilayers , while a similar inhomogeneous superconducting state can be induced by the proximity effect in the ferromagnet - superconductor junction .",
    "@xcite    the stability of the pdw state can be understood on the basis of the spin susceptibility and the band structure investigated in ref .  .",
    "in the absence of spin - orbit coupling the bi - layer system forms two bands , the bonding band and anti - bonding band .",
    "cooper pairs in the pdw state would form by inter - band pairing , in contrast to the bcs state which is an intra - band pairing state . obviously",
    ", the pdw state would not be stable under these circumstances .",
    "on the other hand , the band structure is described by the two spin - split bands on each layer for large @xmath25 . in this case , both bcs and pdw states occur as intra - band cooper pairing states .",
    "although the zero - field transition temperature of the pdw state is lower than the onset of superconductivity ( bcs state ) , a magnetic field along the @xmath32-axis suppresses the bcs state more strongly through paramagnetic depairing .",
    "indeed , the pdw state has a larger spin susceptibility than the bcs state .",

    "an abrupt drop of @xmath42 occurs , while @xmath38 is only weakly affected [ see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( solid line for inner and dashed line for outer layer ) .",
    "the dos of the outer layer always shows a gap at the fermi energy . in the absence of a magnetic field the dos of both the inner and outer layers are essentially identical [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) ] .",
    "differences appear for finite fields . in fig .",

    "surprisingly , a small gap on the inner layer opens up again when we enter the pdw state as revealed by fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](c ) , although the order parameter @xmath50 vanishes in this case .",
    "the origin of this somewhat counter - intuitive behavior lies in the inter - layer hopping and the energy shifts due to the magnetic field leading to the pair breaking .",

    "the paramagnetic pair breaking effects almost disappear .",
    "@xcite in this case the intrinsic order parameter of the inner layer vanishes and a small gap appears in the quasiparticle excitations because the quasiparticles are extended over all layers due to the inter - layer hopping .",
    "as mentioned earlier , possible realizations of the situation discussed here could be found in artificially grown superlattices of @xmath51  @xcite as well as in multilayer high-@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "@xcite these multilayer systems are quasi - two - dimensional superconductors and likely near the pauli limit as they are rather robust against orbital depairing due to the very short coherence lengths .",

    "indeed , the reduced paramagnetic limiting due to the rashba spin - orbit coupling of the outer layers has been confirmed in recent experiments for superlattices @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite the experiment is approaching to the fflo state for the field along _ ab_-plane .",
    "@xcite our study shows that the pdw state may be stabilized in the magnetic field along _ c_-axis . while this lies in the measurable range for the `` low-@xmath3 '' system cecoin@xmath4 , fields revealing the high - field bcs or pdw state are likely beyond 100 t in high-@xmath3 cuprates .    finally , we would like to comment on several points of our results .",
    "first , we restricted to pairing interaction in the spin singlet channel .",
    "spin - singlet pairing is essential for the observation of the phase diagram including different bcs states and the pdw state .",
    "if spin triplet pairing compatible with the rashba - spin - orbit coupling would be dominant , paramagnetic limiting would not play a role at all , since the spin susceptibility would keep the full value of the normal - state pauli spin susceptibility for magnetic fields along the @xmath32-axis .",
    "@xcite therefore , no change of phase would be induced by a magnetic field . for the intermediate situation ,",
    "if spin singlet and spin triplet pairing are of comparable strength an intriguing mixing of the two channels is possible leading to a complex phase structure involving spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking . this situation will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "note , however , that the pairing interactions in the spin triplet channel are expected to be weak in the bulk / superlattice of @xmath51 and high-@xmath3 cuprates . even then , weak interactions in the spin triplet channel gives rise to the uniform spin triplet cooper pairs in the pdw state .",
    "second , we focused on the pauli - limited superconductor with large maki parameter , neglecting orbital depairing effects , in particular , the aspect of a mixed phase including flux lines .",
    "although orbital depairing may play quantitatively important roles for the field along _ c_-axis , the pdw state survives moderate orbital depairing effects ( moderate maki parameters ) because the spatial modulation of vortex state along the _ ab_-plane is not affecting the @xmath52-phase shift along _",
    "c_-axis profoundly .",
    "the situation is quite different for the helical superconducting state in rashba - type non - centrosymmetric superconductors , which is obscured even by the weak orbital depairing effect .",
    "@xcite    third , the pdw state is stabilized not only in the bi- and tri - layers but also in systems with more layers . in such systems",
    "the layers towards the center are subject to paramagnetic limiting and it is expected that within the bcs state we encounter a progressive demolishing of superconductivity in these layers upon increasing field .",
    "eventually , at high enough magnetic field the superconducting system behaves like the bi - layer system in the pdw state . due to the fact that these outer layers are well separated",
    "the condition for the appearance of the pdw state is less stringent than in the real bi - layer system .",
    "these views have been confirmed by us numerically for the 4-layer system .    in conclusion , we have studied the superconducting state in multilayer systems including layer dependent antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling due to the coordination of the layers .",
    "we found that in a magnetic field along the @xmath32-axis spin - orbit coupling influences the phase of the order parameters of different layers .",
    "we find a first order phase transition separating two states different by symmetry : the high - field bcs state which is even under reflection at the center of the multilayer system and the pdw state which is odd under reflection .",
    "the latter phase allows for a considerable enhancement of the upper critical field and generates the uniform order parameter for the spin triplet superconductivity .",
    "this phenomenology relies on the fact that orbital depairing is weak , i.e. the coherence length of the superconductor is very short , and that the dominant pairing is in a spin singlet channel .",
    "this may apply to the artificially grown multilayer version of cecoin@xmath4 and some multilayered high-@xmath53 cuprates .",
