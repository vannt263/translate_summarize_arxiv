    "complex networks are involved in a wide range of biological , social and technological systems@xcite such as , for instance , the internet @xcite , the network of human sexual contacts @xcite , and the transportation infrastructure @xcite .",
    "these nets exhibit `` scale - free '' ( sf ) degree distributions , characterized by a probability @xmath0 that an element in the network is connected to @xmath1 other elements .",
    "usually , the degree exponent assumes a value in the range @xmath2 @xcite . in special ,",
    "since many infectious diseases exploit the social contact network in order to spread among human hosts @xcite and computer viruses inflict significant damages throughout the internet @xcite , epidemic spreading through a variety of networks , including random graphs ( rg ) , small worlds ( sw ) and sf networks , have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "pastor - satorras and coworkers @xcite investigated the epidemic spreading on complex networks using the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model . for all networks considered ( rg , sw , and sf )",
    ", excellent agreements between mean - field and numerical results were obtained at the transition to the absorbing state @xcite .",
    "however , castellano and pastor - satorras @xcite observed a non - mean - field critical behavior dependent on @xmath3 for the classical harris contact process ( cp ) @xcite on sf networks .",
    "so , these models , sharing the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class on regular lattices @xcite , exhibit distinct critical behaviors on sf networks .    the deep impact of complex networks on epidemiology , radically altering traditional control and vaccination strategies , bring to the focus some epidemic processes associated to tropical diseases that can not be properly described by either a purely regular , sw or sf networks .",
    "indeed , the spreading of dengue and yellow fever , the main re - emergent diseases @xcite in the world , are determined by the population dynamics of mosquitoes with a limited flight range ( @xmath4 m for _ aedes aegypti _ ) , domestic habits and local dispersion independent on the human contact network .",
    "furthermore , in their epidemiological chains , a relevant factor for viral circulation is the travels of symptomless infected people .",
    "such travels occur on regional and national interurban commuting traffic networks which behave as sf weighted nets with modularity @xcite .",
    "hence , the spreading of dengue and yellow fever combines a local contact process among mosquitoes and individuals around their houses with long - range dispersal through symptomless infected people traveling between cities . aiming to include this two - component spreading process , silva _ et al .",
    "_ studied the sis model in sf networks of square lattices @xcite .",
    "although they focused on dynamics instead of the transition to the absorbing state , a nonzero epidemic threshold characterized by a singular approach to the epidemic - free state was found .    in this paper",
    ", we report on numerical simulations of the cp model in a sf network in which the nodes are linear chains . the transition to the absorbing state",
    "is focused .",
    "the model and its computer implementation are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "simulations are reported and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "finaly , some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ]",
    "in the model , individuals lie on @xmath5 linear chains of size @xmath6 with periodic boundary conditions ( the cities ) , in which empty and occupied sites represent healthy and infected individuals , respectively .",
    "the cities are connected according to the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite , i. e. , in a sf network with a degree distribution given by @xmath7 ( fig . [",
    "fig : network ] ) .",
    "the model dynamics incorporates a local spreading in which healthy sites with @xmath8 occupied nearest neighbors ( nns ) are infected at a rate @xmath9 while any infected site is spontaneously cured at rate 1 .",
    "additionally , two sites in distinct connected nodes are interchanged at a rate @xmath10 representing a travel .",
    "these travels occur preferentially to nodes with larger connectivity .",
    "the simulations were implemented as follows . at each time step ,",
    "an infected site is selected at random and the time incremented by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total number of infected sites in all nodes .",
    "the selected site will perform one of three actions : ( i ) become healthy with probability @xmath13 ; ( ii ) randomly select and infect one of its healthy nns with probability @xmath14 ; ( iii ) travel with probability @xmath15 . in a travel , the target node @xmath16 , with degree @xmath17 ,",
    "is chosen among all those connected to the departure node @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 .",
    "notice that , differently from the castellano and pastor - satorras model @xcite , the infection spreading occurs among individuals with the same number of connections ( the regular lattice coordination ) as in the original cp @xcite , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the number of connection varies from one individual to other following a power law distribution .",
    "also , the original cp is obtained when @xmath20 ( no travels ) , but none limit corresponds to the cp on scale - free networks .",
    "computer simulations were done for chains of sizes varying from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and number of nodes ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath22 . for each group of @xmath24 samples ,",
    "a sf network was generated from @xmath25 fully interconnected nodes accordingly the ba preferential attachment algorithm  @xcite .",
    "new nodes were sequentially added to the growing network through @xmath26 links , the minimum degree value . in order to determine the criticality at the transition to the absorbing state , the _ overall density _",
    "@xmath27 of infected sites through all nodes , the _ local density _ @xmath28 restricted to those nodes with at least one infected site , the _ fraction of colonized nodes _ @xmath29 ( those with infected sites ) , and the _ survival probability _ @xmath30 were evaluated .",
    "as observed for the cp in sf networks @xcite , the simulations in fig . [ fig : rhops ] revealed a non null epidemic threshold .",
    "the upper inset shows the corresponding survival probabilities , exhibiting the same behavior .",
    "the initial condition was a single infected site at the center of a randomly chosen node . in the upper - critical regime ,",
    "both quantities reach constant asymptotic values , contrasting with the increasing as @xmath31 of the mean number of infected sites for the cp on regular lattices @xcite .",
    "the heterogeneous distributions of infected sites in the nodes , with only few of them highly infected , produce the plateaus observed at relatively short times ( @xmath32 for chains with @xmath33 sites ) . in general , models with absorbing configurations exhibit power law time dependencies @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 at the critical point for the survival probability , the mean number of infected sites , and the spreading of epidemics , respectively @xcite .",
    "accordingly , fig .",
    "[ fig : rhops ] provides spreading exponents close to zero for the cp model on the present hybrid network .",
    "the mean lifetime divergence when @xmath37 can be used to estimate the critical point . the exponential decay @xmath38 [ lower inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhops ] ] determines the decay time as a function of @xmath39 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : txnt ] , an exponential divergence given by @xmath40 was found . here , @xmath41 .",
    "this behavior differs from the power law @xmath42 usually observed in transitions to absorbing states in regular lattices @xcite .",
    "indeed , a power law also fits the data , but very large exponent values ( @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) were obtained , supporting further the hypothesis of exponential divergence . the exponents @xmath45 and @xmath46 are consistent with the well known scaling relations @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite . despite very strong finite size effects , a characteristic feature of epidemics on sf networks @xcite , the critical rate can be determined by exponential nonlinear fittings . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : txnt ] , the critical rate is shown as a function of @xmath50@xcite and its extrapolation to an infinite size provides a critical rate @xmath51 , in which the error is in parenthesis .",
    "this value agrees with estimates from quasi - stationary simulations described in the next paragraphs . the critical rate and exponential divergence of @xmath52 does not depend on network size @xmath5 for the studied range .",
    "the same analysis was done for @xmath28 and @xmath30 providing the same critical rate and exponential divergence for the mean lifetime estimated through the analysis of @xmath27 .    in order to perform a finite size",
    "scaling ( fss ) analysis near the criticality , we used quasistationary ( qs ) simulations in which only the survival trials are considered in the averages @xcite .",
    "moreover , a generalized scaling hypothesis that explicitly considers the validity of the usual fss @xcite for fixed @xmath5 or fixed @xmath6 was assumed    @xmath53.\\ ] ]    similar relations can be proposed for the other quantities .",
    "thus , the thermodynamic limit can be estimated through three distinct ways .",
    "the first one , in which the size @xmath6 grows faster than the number of nodes @xmath5 , implying @xmath54 , seems to be more adequate to describe epidemic spreading in the real world .",
    "alternatively , the fss analysis can be performed with @xmath5 growing faster than @xmath6 , leading to @xmath55 , or maintaining a constant ratio @xmath56 .    for a large but fixed @xmath5 , eq . ( [ eq : fss ] ) becomes @xmath57 , in which @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 is the scaling function @xcite .",
    "so , at the critical point ( @xmath62 ) , the density scales as @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , power laws can be associated to the other quantities at the criticality , namely , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoqs ] .",
    "notice that the density of infected nodes @xmath67 grows with the node size .",
    "the exponents and the critical rates , determined through the null curvature criterion @xcite , are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these values are , within the margins of error , independent on the number of nodes for @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath22 , or travel rates on the studied interval . in turn , the critical infection rate decreases continuously from @xmath70 ( the cp critical rate ) for @xmath20 to @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",

    "[ fig : collapse ] ( upper ) are shown the collapses of @xmath27 obtained onto @xmath82 ( fixed @xmath5 ) for @xmath83 and onto @xmath84 ( fixed @xmath6 ) for @xmath85 .",
    "thus , using the exponents from table [ tab2 ] , we found @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for fixed @xmath5 , and @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 for fixed @xmath6 .",
    "the large value found for @xmath92 , representing a rapid vanishing of @xmath27 at @xmath93 , is consistent with the exponential approach obtained for the sis model in ba networks @xcite .",
    "also , the finite value obtained for @xmath94 in the qs analysis for fixed @xmath5 deserves a comment .",
    "it contrasts with the exponential divergence of the characteristic epidemic mean lifetime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : txnt ] ) . this paradoxical result could be interpreted in terms of two time scales for the infection dynamics .",
    "the first one refers to an exponentially long persistence time of the epidemics spreading from a spatially concentrated focus in the subcritical phase .",
    "we conjecture that the heterogeneity of the connection among cities , thereby of travels , promotes this long persistence , in contrast to the cp with sources @xcite if the sf network is replaced by a regular one .",
    "the second time scale is associated to the outbreaks , which diverges algebraically at the critical point as in local epidemics .",
    "the exponents listed in tables 1 and 2 are quite distinct from those related to dp universality class @xcite ( fixed @xmath5 ) and , also , do not agree with numerical estimates for cp on sf networks @xcite ( fixed @xmath6 ) , establishing a new universality class .",
    "we presented numerical simulations of the cp on hybrid networks in which the nodes are themselves regular lattices and individuals travel between nodes .",
    "the main results are a finite epidemic threshold and an exponentially long persistence of the epidemics below the critical rate , concomitantly with a power law divergence of the outbreak s duration .",
    "generalized scaling functions involving both regular and sf components were proposed and the associated critical exponents determined , demonstrating that the cp on this hybrid network and nonvanishing travel rates establishes a new universality class . also , at criticality , the densities of infected individuals inside the nodes and the fraction of cities in which the epidemics persists are independent .",
    "the epidemic spreading on regular lattices is defined as @xmath95 , where the sum is done over all occupied sites and @xmath96 is the distance from the original seed where a single infected individual was introduced at @xmath97 ."
