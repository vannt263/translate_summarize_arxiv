    "a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) is a close compact binary star formed by a white dwarf primary and a low - mass near - main - sequence secondary star ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in non - magnetic cvs the companion transfers material to the white dwarf primary via roche - lobe overflow and an accretion disk",
    "is formed around the white dwarf .    the orbital periods ( ) of cvs decrease as a consequence of orbital angular momentum loss ( aml ) .",
    "the two mechanisms that are thought to drive aml are magnetic wind braking of the donor star @xcite and gravitational radiation @xcite , the former several orders of magnitude stronger than the latter .",
    "once the secondary becomes fully convective ( @xmath5 3 hours ) magnetic braking is greatly reduced @xcite causing the secondary to detach from its roche - lobe in the 23 hour orbital period range known as the period gap ( see the orbital period distribution by e.g. @xcite ) . at this stage",
    "the evolution becomes much slower , as the aml is mainly driven by gravitational radiation . at @xmath5 2 hours",
    "the shrinking roche - lobe comes back into contact with the secondary star and mass transfer is resumed at a much lower rate .",
    "once the secondary star becomes degenerate ( @xmath5 80 minutes ) , the overall mass - radius relation for the donor star changes such that it becomes larger upon mass loss .",
    "therefore , the orbital period increases with further mass transfer and the binary orbit widens @xcite .",
    "the secondary stars of cvs with orbital periods below @xmath6 hours are apparently un - evolved m - dwarf main sequence stars , as expected from the well known orbital period - density relation for roche - lobe filling stars @xcite .",
    "however , several cvs have been recently identified harbouring secondary stars that are too hot for their masses : v485 (= 59 minutes , @xcite ) , eipsc ( also known as rxj2329 + 0628 , = 64 minutes , @xcite ) , qzserpentis (= 2 hours , @xcite ) , sdssj013701.06 - 091234.9 (= 84 minutes , @xcite ) , sdssj170213.26 + 322954.1 (= 2.4 hours , @xcite ) , cssj134052.0 + 151341 (= 2.45 hours , @xcite ) , galexj194419.33 + 491257.0 (= 76 minutes , @xcite ) .",
    "a few examples exist of longer orbital period cvs that contain secondary stars that are also too hot for their masses ( aeaquarii , = 9.9 hours , @xcite ; hs0218 + 3229 , = 7.1 hours , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the current peculiar configuration of these systems can be explained if the secondary stars underwent considerable nuclear evolution ",
    "i.e. they were nearing the end of the main sequence  before they began to transfer mass onto the white dwarfs @xcite . in this scenario these more evolved donor stars were initially more massive than typical cv donors and likely underwent a phase of intense thermal - timescale mass transfer . under these circumstances ,",
    "the accreted material from the evolved donors should reflect in a different composition compared to canonical cvs , i.e. due to cno - processes we expect depletion of carbon versus nitrogen .",
    "indeed , unusually high nv / civ line flux ratios have been observationally confirmed in ultraviolet spectra of @xcite and qzserpentis @xcite .",
    "however , it has to be stressed that such a phase of mass transfer is not the underlying cause of the later unusual appearance of the donor stars , as many canonical cvs have also potentially passed through a phase of thermal timescale mass transfer @xcite .    in the course of our search for white dwarf - main sequence binaries @xcite in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) we discovered sdssj001153.08 - 064739.2 ( hereafter sdssj0011 - 0647 ) and we here present this object as a new system belonging to this peculiar type of cv .",
    "we show that sdssj0011 - 0647 is one of the most extreme cases in which the secondary star is far too hot for its mass .",
    "the sdss spectrum of sdssj0011 - 0647 is shown in figure[f - spec ] .",
    "the overall shape of the spectrum is blackbody - like , however reveals broad , double peaked balmer emission lines , characteristic of an accretion disk , and a very strong mgi absorption feature near 5150 .",
    "this latter feature is the main absorption complex in mid - k stars , which we attribute to the donor star of sdssj0011 - 0647 .",
    "no obvious white dwarf features however can be identified .",
    "the sdss @xmath7 magnitudes of sdssj0011 - 0647 are 19.0 , 17.8 , 17.1 , 16.9 , and 16.8 respectively .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the telescope / instrumentation used for the follow - up observations of sdssj0011 - 0647 , and outline the reduction of the data .",
    "time - resolved high - resolution spectroscopy of sdssj0011 - 0647 was obtained along the 25th of june 2011 and the 22nd and 23rd of september 2012 with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph on the 6.5 m clay telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the ccd of mike s red arm has a pixel scale of 0.13/pixel , therefore we binned the detector by a factor of three in the dispersion direction and a factor of two in the spatial direction , thus reducing the readout time and readout noise .",
    "this , together with a 1slit , provided access to the 5200 - 9000 wavelength range at a resolving power of 22,000 ( i.e. 0.3 at the location of the h@xmath8 line ) .",
    "a total of 20 spectra were obtained for sdssj0011 - 0647 , with exposure times of 600 seconds . the data analysis ( reduction and wavelength calibration )",
    "was carried out with the @xmath9 software using the standard @xmath9 package @xmath10 .",
    "sdssj0011 - 0647 was observed with the high - speed camera ultracam @xcite mounted as a visitor instrument on the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , chile on the 24th and 25th of may 2011 .",
    "ultracam consists of three frame transfer ccds allowing one to obtain simultaneous photometry in three different filters . for our observations of sdssj0011 - 0647 we used the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 filters . on both nights",
    "the seeing was poor ( @xmath142  ) and the moon virtually full , hence we used relatively long exposure times of 10 seconds ( the dead - time between the 10 second ultracam exposures was only 25ms ) .",
    "we obtained just over an hour of photometry on the first night and almost two hours on the second night .",
    "all the data were bias subtracted , flat - fielded and extracted using the ultracam pipeline @xcite .",
    "the source flux was determined with aperture photometry using a variable aperture , whereby its radius was scaled according to the full width at half maximum .",
    "variations in observing conditions were accounted for by determining the flux relative to several comparison stars in the field of view .",
    "additional photometry of sdssj0011 - 0647 was available from the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we performed differential photometry on the reduced ( bias - subtracted and flat - fielded ) crts images following the routine described by @xcite .",
    "our obtained @xmath15-band light curve is shown in figure[f - catalina ] .",
    "the crts photometry spans a time interval of @xmath59 years and reveals an increase of @xmath52 magnitudes at hjd @xmath52454400 days .",
    "we interpret this effect as sdssj0011 - 0647 undergoing an outburst , which clearly confirms the cv nature of sdssj0011 - 0647 .",
    "here we make use of the spectroscopic and photometric data outlined in the previous section to obtain the orbital and stellar parameters of sdssj0011 - 0647 .",
    ".[t - rvs ] nai@xmath168183.27,8194.81 radial velocities of the donor star in sdssj0011 - 0647 .",
    "heliocentric julian dates , hjds , are also provided .",
    "the radial velocities folded over the orbital period are shown in the bottom panel of figure[f - sol ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     inspection of figure[f - stype ] and table[t - specfit ] reveals that the best combined fits to the observed spectrum of sdssj0011 - 0647 are obtained when we use the k4v and g8iv template stars , even though reasonably good fits are also obtained for the k1iv and k1v templates .",
    "this corroborates , overall , our previous findings , i.e. that the donor star has a spectral type that is much earlier than expected for its mass .",
    "the quality of the fits deteriorates when adopting the later spectral types k7v and m0v , and the worst fits are obtained for the m3v , m5v and g8v templates .",
    "it is worth noting that the accretion disk contributions are found to be @xmath17 per cent for the best - matching donor star templates ( falling between the previous spectroscopic estimated value of @xmath18 per cent , section[s - rot ] , and the photometric obtained value of @xmath19 per cent , section[s - masses ] ) , however the disk contributions increase considerably for the worse - fitting donor star templates k7v , g8v , m0v , m3v and m5v ( table[t - specfit ] ) .",
    "this effect is simple to understand : when adopting a donor star template that does not match the observed spectrum of sdssj0011 - 0647 , our fit decreases the contribution of the donor star to the composite model , the contribution of the disk is increased to compensate , and the disk temperature is optimized such that the quasi - blackbody spectrum of the disk approximates the observed data .",
    "the most noticeable feature that the early - to - mid k star templates reproduce well is the strong mgi absorption complex near 5150 .",
    "this feature is weak , or absent , in the earlier and later donor stars , as well as in any accretion disk model .",
    "we investigate the diagnostic strength of the mgi absorption in more detail by comparing the @xmath20 values obtained in the 3850 - 6000 wavelength range ( designated as @xmath21 in table[t - specfit ] ) , where the observed spectrum displays both spectral features and continuum .",
    "clearly , the best - combined fits which provide the lowest @xmath20-fit values ( those in which the donor star template is a k4v , g8iv , k1iv and k1v ) provide also the lowest @xmath21-fit values .",
    "we conclude that spectral types later than k7v and earlier than g8v can be ruled out for the donor star of sdssj0011 - 0647 .",
    "this confirms in a robust way our previous finding , i.e. that this star is clearly too hot for its mass . in the following section we discuss in detail the implications of this peculiarity on the evolution of sdssj0011 - 0647 .",
    "we also find that , as expected , the white dwarf contribution to the optical flux of sdssj0011 - 0647 is small ( 3 - 5 per cent at 5615.64 , table[t - specfit ] ) , and that its effective temperature is @xmath514000 - 16000k .",
    "sdssj0011 - 0647 is peculiar cv in which the donor star is substantially hotter ( the observations are best - matched with an early - to - mid k star ) than expected for its mass ( 0.210.45@xmath22 ) , one of the most extreme cases among cvs of its kind .",
    "the present - day configuration of these peculiar cvs can be explained if the donor stars underwent substantial nuclear evolution before reaching contact @xcite .",
    "this is only possible if at the onset of mass transfer the secondary star of sdssj0011 - 0647 was considerably more massive than the mass of canonical cv donors .",
    "hence , it is almost certain that sdssj0011 - 0647 passed through a substantial phase of thermal - timescale mass transfer , during which it might have been expected to appear as a super - soft source @xcite .",
    "super - soft x - ray sources are a viable channel to produce type ia supernovae ( snia , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although sdssj0011 - 0647 obviously failed at producing a snia during this intense phase of thermal transfer mass transfer , its prior evolution may help to test models of snia progenitors , i.e. if we were able to somehow estimate the original mass of the white dwarf , then the present - day component masses would constrain the accretion efficiency of the white dwarf during that super - soft phase @xcite .",
    "however , the arguments are only likely to be indirect .    depending on the degree of hydrogen depletion in the center , evolved donor stars are not expected to become fully convective @xcite",
    ". therefore they should not be subject to the same disruption of magnetic braking as the donor stars in canonical cvs .",
    "these peculiar cvs are thus not expected to detach in the orbital period gap between 2 - 3 hours .",
    "the orbital period of sdssj0011 - 0647 is in the middle of the period gap , thereby providing direct observational evidence supporting the models for these hot donor stars .",
    "arguably , this also provides indirect support for the belief that the period gap arises as a consequence of the secondary stars in normal cvs becoming fully convective .",
    "future tests of the angular momentum loss in sdssj0011 - 0647 may be able to test magnetic braking in a previously unexplored regime .",
    "these cvs with evolved donor stars are also predicted to later become am cvn - like binaries @xcite .",
    "further , more detailed , measurements of the properties of sdssj0011 - 0647 would thus help to refine current models describing this evolutionary phase .",
    "for example , future photometric near - infrared observations are likely to constrain considerably the orbital inclination ( and therefore the stellar masses , figure[f - mfunc ] ) of sdssj0011 - 0647 , as the disk contribution to the ellipsoidal modulation is essentially negligible at these wavelengths .",
    "in addition , it is possible to indirectly measure the mass of the white dwarf from ultraviolet ( e.g. hst ) spectroscopic observations .",
    "furthermore , sdssj0011 - 0647 may help in constraining population models that describe the evolution of these peculiar cvs @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that these models have not predicted many , if any , systems with similar donor temperatures ( or spectral types ) to sdssj0011 - 0647 at the same orbital period .",
    "this may indicate that the specific properties of sdssj0011 - 0647 require unexpected or rare initial conditions .",
    "for example , the binary grids used by @xcite may not have been able to predict the existence of systems resembling sdssj0011 - 0647 either because the upper limit to the donor mass ( @xmath23 ) was too low or because the spacing in initial period was insufficiently tight , i.e. either the initial parameter space was not large enough or not sufficiently finely - sampled . in particular , since the necessary orbital period at contact may have been close to the bifurcation period beyond which systems would become wider rather than tighter ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , some careful fine - tuning may be required when setting up grids of binary evolution sequences in order to cover the part of parameter space which produced sdssj0011 - 0647 .    combining sdssj170213.26 + 323954.1 @xcite , cssj134052.0 + 151341 @xcite and",
    "the system we have discovered makes three peculiar cvs containing hot donor stars which have near - identical orbital periods ( @xmath24 hours ) . to this sample",
    "we could add the recurrent nova imnor ( 2.462h ; @xcite ) , as formation models for the recurrent novae with short orbital periods typically involve a similar phase of thermal - timescale mass transfer onto the white dwarf ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( although the spectral type of the donor of imnor is unknown ) .",
    "only one other peculiar cv containing a hot donor , qzserpentis @xcite , is known in the period gap ( and that is at the very short - period edge of the gap ) .",
    "this implies @xmath51/2 of the total currently - observed sample of these peculiar cvs are located in the period gap , and 4/5 of those ( if we include also imnor ) with nearly the same orbital period .",
    "even though we are subject to low number statistics , this concentration of systems at a particular orbital period within the period gap may deserve further attention .",
    "8183.27,8194.81 ( black solid dots , originated on the donor star ) radial velocities folded over our adopted value of the orbital period and best sine - fit to the data ( dashed line ) .",
    "the horizontal dotted line represents the systemic velocity.,width=453 ]       ultraviolet fluxes ( black solid dots ) of sdssj0011 - 0647 to a set of combined donor star template ( magenta ) , white dwarf model spectra ( gray ) and accretion disk model spectra ( blue ; red for the total combined model , also normalised ) .",
    "the spectral types of the donor star templates used and the @xmath20 that result from comparing the combined model to the observed spectra are also indicated ( where @xmath25 is the @xmath20 obtained using the entire optical range and @xmath21 is the @xmath20 obtained considering only the 3850 - 6000 range ) .",
