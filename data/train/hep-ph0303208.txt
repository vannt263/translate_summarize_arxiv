    "it is a commonly accepted scenario for central ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions that immediately after the collision , sandwiched between the receding baryonic pancakes , a rapidly expanding spatial region is left , characterized by high energy density and low baryon density @xcite",
    ". the expansion may be mainly in beam direction , such that the longitudinal velocities of volume elements are proportional to their distance from the collision point .",
    "assuming invariance with respect to transformations between comoving frames , the rapidity density of particles emitted from this expanding rod will show a plateau reflecting that symmetry .",
    "this plateau is experimentally well established , and recent results for baryonic yields indicate that for high centrality and increasing energy the antibaryon / baryon ratio in fact tends towards unity @xcite .",
    "the production of baryon - antibaryon pairs from regions of highly excited vacuum presents a challenge for many different types of theoretical models .",
    "it arises very naturally in models where baryon density is identified with topological winding density in effective meson field theories @xcite . for random field configurations on random triangular lattices",
    "the probability for nontrivial winding provides an upper ( kibble ) limit for baryon - antibaryon multiplicities @xcite . the dynamical evolution in time , which follows the preparation of a statistical ensemble at some initial time , tends to smoothen the random initial configurations , resulting in frequent annihilation of positive and negative winding density , such that the final baryon - antibaryon multiplicities will strongly depend on the cooling mechanism and freeze - out times ,",
    "after which the system is sufficiently decoupled , such that baryons and antibaryons no longer interact @xcite .",
    "apart from genuine energy dissipation through meson emission , the rapid expansion provides a kinetic cooling mechanism which naturally decreases all gradients in a field configuration and , consequently , the winding densities .",
    "this expansion is conveniently accounted for by transforming the space - time frame into the rapidity - proper - time frame and formulating the field dynamics in these locally comoving frames @xcite .",
    "we repeat the essential points of this formulation in section ii , with specific attention to the soliton solutions .",
    "we also include the effects of genuine damping and discuss the adiabatic approximation which applies for overdamped systems and provides significant simplifications in the numerical simulation of such evolutions .",
    "in section iii of the present paper we apply this formalism to the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional @xmath0 model , which is characterized by only two discrete degenerate vacua .",
    "this provides a very transparent example for the mechanisms which govern the phase transition from the hot initial configurations through the freeze - out into the final cold system which has settled into the true vacua and consists of non - interacting solitons and vacuum fluctuations .",
    "we obtain simple analytical expressions for freeze - out time and kink multiplicities , both for the system moving freely in the expanding bjorken rod , and for the damped system which additionally looses energy through a dissipative term .",
    "as standard effective action @xmath1 for a scalar field @xmath2 in space - time @xmath3 we consider [ 1 ] s=((_t)^2-(_z)^2 -v ( ) ) dzdt where @xmath4 denotes a suitable local self - interaction .",
    "the transformation from @xmath3 to proper time @xmath5 and rapidity @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 the boundaries in the forward light cone are ( note : @xmath8 ) _ 0^dt _ -t^t dz _ 0^d _ -atanh^atanhd .",
    "note that ( only ) for @xmath9 the @xmath6-integral extends from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "we therefore consider instead the action [ 2 ] s = d_-^+ d=(t - l_2-u ) dwith [ 3 ] t()=_-^+ ( ) ^2 d ,   l_2()=_-^+()^2 d ,   u()=_-^+ v ( ) d. variation with respect to @xmath2 then leads to the equation of motion ( eom ) @xmath12 : [ 4 ] + -+v/=0 .",
    "consider the total energy @xmath13 at a given proper time @xmath5 [ 6 ] e ( ) ( ( /)-l)d= ( t()+l_2()+u ( ) ) .",
    "the total derivative of this energy with respect to proper time @xmath5 is @xmath14 [ 7 ] = ( t - l_2+u ) + ( -+v/)d . using eom ( [ 4 ] ) leads to [ 8 ] = ( -t - l_2+u)=-(e-2u ) .",
    "this is solved by e=+^u dwith constant @xmath15 .",
    "( a ) : if the potential @xmath4 averaged over rapidity is independent of proper time @xmath5 ( as can be realized for random distributions of @xmath2 in rapidity space , i.e. during the early phase of an evolution ) such that we have @xmath16 , then a simple solution to ( [ 8 ] ) is obtained [ 9 ] t+l_2= ,    e=+c_1with constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the first term ( solving the homogenous part of eq.([8 ] ) )",
    "looks like damping , but it is a purely geometrical decrease .",
    "( its time integral is still divergent ) .",
    "( b ) : if the energy for large proper times @xmath19 approaches a finite constant @xmath20 , then eq.([8 ] ) requires that [ 9b ] _ ( t()+l_2 ( ) - u ( ) ) = 0 + with eventual fluctuations in @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( which , however have to add up to a smooth total energy @xmath13 , because of @xmath23 ) . for proper - time averages over at least one period of the fluctuations we have [ 9c ] _ = _ = e_/2 .    ( b1 ) : this may be realized such that for large @xmath5 all time derivatives disappear ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 .",
    "this represents an ensemble of adiabatically shrinking solitons which carry all of the conserved energy @xmath26 ( see below ) .",
    "( b2 ) : another way to arrive at an asymptotically constant @xmath27 appears if the gradient terms @xmath28 become negligible after a long time . then eq.([9c ] ) requires that asymptotically @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equal and constant in proper time .",
    "this implies that there exist non - vanishing average time - derivatives in the system which decrease like @xmath31 in proper time .      for a stability condition",
    "we omit all time - derivative terms , i.e. put @xmath32 and keep in the eom only [ 10 ] -+v/=0 .",
    "this equation describes extended objects whose size in rapidity space shrinks proportional to increasing proper time , which here simply acts as a scaling parameter .",
    "the derivative of their total energy @xmath33 with respect to proper time is given by [ 11 ] = ( u - l_2 ) . from multiplying eom",
    "( 12 ) with @xmath34 we have [ 12 ] ( -()^2 + v())=0 , or , if the integrals are finite , [ 13 ] l_2=u ,   de / d=0 .",
    "this result , that for the shrinking solitons @xmath28 and @xmath21 are independent of proper time , can of course be obtained by simply replacing @xmath35 by @xmath36 in the definitions ( [ 3 ] ) .    however , this only holds in an adiabatic limit , where proper time can be considered as a parameter .",
    "in fact , for the shrinking solitons we have @xmath37 , so [ 13b ] t=^2 ( ( ) ) ^2 d. so , in the limit of large proper times , @xmath38 becomes rapidly negligible as compared to the constants @xmath28 and @xmath21 , and @xmath27 is asymptotically conserved .",
    "genuine dissipation is taken into acount by adding a dissipative term to the eom . with dissipation constant @xmath39 , eq.(6 )",
    "now reads [ 14 ] ( + ) + -+v/=0 . inserting this into eq.([7 ] )",
    "we have [ 15 ] = -(e-2u)-()^2d .",
    "the first term again is purely geometrical , while the rate of energy loss due to dissipation is given by the second term alone [ 16 ] ( ) _ diss=-()^2d .",
    "it is equal to @xmath40 times the kinetic energy @xmath38 , so we have [ 15a ] = -(t+l_2-u)-2 t . for the early stages of an evolution , in analogy to ( [ 9 ] )",
    ", we expect for the smooth parts of @xmath41 and @xmath21 [ 9aa ] <",
    "t+l_2>= f ( ) ,  < u>=c_1 .",
    "the function @xmath42 satisfies the differential equation [ diffeq ] = -2 d .",
    "the dissipation will exponentially reduce the kinetic gradients as compared to the rapidity gradients , so for the smooth parts @xmath30 and @xmath43 we try the ansatz = ( -)<l_2 > , where we have allowed for an as yet undetermined constant @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to f()=()^2/ if we require that @xmath45 for all values of @xmath39 , i.e. if for the initial configurations at @xmath46 the integrals @xmath22 are independent of @xmath39 .",
    "this provides an analytical expression for @xmath43 [ l2approx ] < l_2>= as compared to explicitly solving the eom ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "we shall see below that its intersection with the linearly rising potential @xmath47 may be used to define a simple estimate for the freeze - out time @xmath48 .",
    "for large values of @xmath39 , such that @xmath49 , all fluctuating terms are suppressed from the very beginning , the evolutions get overdamped and we may approximate the eom ( [ 14 ] ) by omitting all second - order time derivatives .",
    "as @xmath50 , it is then also sufficient to keep in the dissipative terms only the constant @xmath39 [ 17 ] -+v/=0 . with this equation of motion",
    "we now have [ 18 ] = ( -l_2+u)-2 t . proceeding as in equations ( [ 9aa ] ) and ( [ diffeq ] ) , with @xmath51 , we now have [ l2adia ] l_2= ( -2__0^(t / l_2 ) d ) . with a suitable ansatz for the ratio @xmath52 during the early part of the evolution",
    "we may again obtain a simple expression for @xmath28 and , in connection with @xmath51 , for the freeze - out time @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath0-model uses the local potential [ v ] v()= ( ^2 - 1)^2 , so the action @xmath53 in @xmath3-coordinates is [ 20 ] s=((_t)^2-(_z)^2 - ( ^2 - 1)^2 ) dzdt . for stable static solitons we have @xcite [ s1 ] ( _ z)^2dz= ( ^2 - 1)^2 dz= .      after transforming to the bjorken frame the stability condition ( [ 10 ] )",
    "looks like the equation for stable static solutions in the rest frame with @xmath54 replaced by @xmath55 .",
    "so we have according to eq.([s1 ] ) [ s2 ] ( _ ) ^2d=^2 ( ^2 - 1)^2 d= . with definitions ( [ 3 ] ) , we find [ s3 ] l_2=u = e/2= = _ .",
    "so , in the ( adiabatic , i.e. @xmath56 ) limit of large proper times the total energy of the shrinking solitons in the bjorken frame approaches a constant which coincides with their static energy in the @xmath3-frame .",
    "this represents a realization of the above remark ( b1 ) in section ii .",
    "it should , however , be noted that on a lattice these relations are violated if with increasing proper time the shrinking size @xmath57 of the stable solitons approaches the lattice constant ( set equal to one ) .",
    "gradients for single solitons then can not exceed the value of 2 ( corresponding to a jump in @xmath2 from -1 to + 1 for neighbouring lattice points ) .",
    "so we have [ limit ] l_2 n    , where @xmath58 is the final number of kinks+antikinks surviving for large proper times .",
    "this means that @xmath28 will not approach a constant , but will decrease like @xmath59 , while the kinks contribution to @xmath21 rapidly goes to zero like @xmath60 .",
    "so , on a lattice , @xmath61 can not be reached in an adiabatic limit for large proper times .",
    "still , @xmath62 for @xmath19 can be realized by balancing fluctuational contributions to @xmath38 and @xmath21 such that @xmath27 is constant , which constitutes a non - adiabatic realization of the remark ( b2 ) discussed in section ii.a .",
    "let us first consider evolutions in the symmetric potential [ v+ ] v^(+)()= ( ( ^2 + 1)^2 - 1 ) , which has only one single minimum at @xmath63 .",
    "( we subtract the constant @xmath64 to maintain @xmath65 ) .",
    "so , a priori , we would not expect any phase transition to occur in this potential .",
    "initial configurations at @xmath66 for the evolutions consist of values @xmath67 at each lattice point @xmath68 , randomly chosen from a normalized gaussian distribution [ gauss ] f()= ( - ) with mean square deviation @xmath69 .",
    "so , the system looks similar for all rapidity intervals that make up the @xmath6 lattice .",
    "the integral [ v1 ] v^(+ ) ( ) dn v^(+ ) ( ) f()dfor sufficiently small width @xmath70 is approximated by n",
    "^2 f()d= n ^2 .",
    "so , the initial value of @xmath71 at @xmath46 is given by @xmath72 , while @xmath73 will be oscillating around the time - averaged @xmath74 given by the straight line [ u+ ] < u^(+ ) > = n ^2 . for an estimate of the integral @xmath75",
    "we implement the first derivatives on the lattice as @xmath76 and obtain [ deriv ] ( ) ^2 d(_i)^2 -_i+1_i = n(|^2-|^2 ) . for the second equality we have assumed that the two - point correlation function @xmath77 factorizes , i.e. that @xmath2-values at neighbouring lattice points are uncorrelated .",
    "so , the initial value for @xmath28 at @xmath46 is given by [ l_2ini ]",
    "l_2(_0 ) = n .",
    "the initial values for the proper time derivatives @xmath78 are not relevant and we can put them to zero .",
    "the equations of motion immediately after the onset of the evolution build up @xmath38 such that the smooth sum @xmath22 closely follows the line @xmath79 , while @xmath38 and @xmath28 separately oscillate around the time averaged values [ l_2 ] <",
    "l_2>=<t > = n . during this early phase of the evolution",
    "the potential is unimportant because it is suppressed by two orders of @xmath5 as compared to @xmath28 . the proper time value [ tf ] _",
    "f^2=2 /marks the intersection of @xmath43 with the potential @xmath74 where @xmath71 begins to influence the motion .",
    "this marks the end of this first ( gradient - dominated ) phase which consists of freely propagating fluctuations .    for times",
    "@xmath80 , the gradient terms become irrelevant . if , for large @xmath5 , we neglect in the eom ( [ 4 ] ) the gradient terms altogether , then the fluctuations satisfy the simplified eom [ 21 ] + + = 0 which is solved by [ amplitudes ] ~ ( -/4 ) + o(^-1 ) , i.e. , the amplitudes of the fluctuations decrease like @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that both , @xmath71 and @xmath38 , oscillate with constant amplitude , and frequency @xmath81 , both adding up to an asymptotically constant @xmath82 , while @xmath28 rapidly decreases like @xmath83 .",
    "so , for times @xmath80 , we are left with a system dominated by non - propagating fluctuations , or , in other words , with a system of n independently moving oscillators , all fluctuating with the same frequency @xmath84 ( the mass at @xmath63 ) and amplitudes decreasing like @xmath31 .",
    "asymptotically for large proper times the total energy is conserved , realizing case ( b2 ) discussed above .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the typical features of an evolution in the @xmath85-potential ( for @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath88 , the actual choice of @xmath89 and the initial values of @xmath90 are unimportant .",
    "so , in contrast to our original expectations , the evolution shows very distinctly a transition from the early gradient - dominated phase to a system of @xmath91 independent oscillators dominated by the local potential . in the first phase we observe the virial theorem @xmath92 , in the second phase we have @xmath93 . at the transition time @xmath94 , which is independent of @xmath95 and @xmath89 , @xmath43 changes continuously from the @xmath96 to @xmath97 behaviour .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath48 can be obtained from the following argument : in the bjorken frame , the field fluctuations carry an effective wave number @xmath98 and mass @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath99 were not limited from above , then for any @xmath5 there could be propagating waves with @xmath100 .",
    "however , if the system is characterized by a momentum cut - off , @xmath101 , then for @xmath102 , the system decouples into @xmath91 independent oscillators with the same frequency @xmath84 . on the lattice ,",
    "@xmath99 is limited by the finite lattice constant @xmath103 : @xmath104 .",
    "so , ( with @xmath103 put to 1 ) , this provides an estimate for the freeze - out time @xmath48 .",
    "the statistical average over the initial ensemble then leads to ( [ tf ] ) . from this consideration",
    "we conclude that the observed freeze - out is the consequence of a momentum cut - off , which in the present case is imposed by the lattice .",
    "we should , however , keep in mind that here the lattice constant has a well - defined physical meaning : with our choice of the initial ensemble , where values of the field variables @xmath67 at neighbouring lattice sites are uncorrelated , the lattice constant can be identified with the initial correlation length @xmath105 .",
    "so , in this case , the freeze - out time should rather be written as [ tfr ] _",
    "f^2=.      let us now consider an evolution subject to the potential @xmath106 ( [ v ] ) , which is characterized by two degenerate minima at @xmath107 and satisfies @xmath108 .",
    "as before , for sufficiently small width @xmath70 of the initial distribution , the potential is unimportant during the early phase of an evolution .",
    "so , starting from the same initial distribution as described above , the first part of an evolution proceeds exactly as in the case of the symmetric potential @xmath85 ( [ v+ ] ) .",
    "the smooth part of the integral @xmath109 again is approximated by [ u- ] < u^(-)>=(-)n ^2 , while @xmath43 is still given by ( [ l_2 ] ) .",
    "so , the freeze - out time @xmath48 as determined from [ freeze ] -<u^(-)>=<l_2 > again is given by ( [ tf ] ) .",
    "( due to the opposite sign of @xmath110 as compared to the case of the symmetrical potential @xmath74 , this condition here implies that even for the highest wave numbers @xmath111 supported by the lattice , the frequencies become imaginary for @xmath112 ) .    for @xmath112 ,",
    "the gradients which couple the field variables @xmath67 at neighbouring lattice sites are suppressed and the onset of the potential drives each @xmath67 towards + 1 or -1 , depending only on the sign of @xmath67 at @xmath113 .",
    "so , evidently , @xmath48 is also that point in time when the number @xmath58 of kinks+antikinks finally found in the system for @xmath114 is determined . necessarily , because for @xmath112 the @xmath67 at neighbouring sites no longer interact , the analytical shape of the stable ( shrinking ) kink is irrelevant , or , in other words , the size @xmath115 of the kinks has shrunk below the lattice unit .",
    "this provides another interpretation of the freeze - out time which we could have chosen alternatively to define @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath116 , kinks and antikinks no longer overlap , so there is no further annihilation and their total number @xmath58 is conserved .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the typical features of an evolution in the symmetry - broken potential @xmath106 ( [ v ] ) ( for @xmath86 ) , starting from an initial gaussian distribution with @xmath87 . for proper times larger than the freeze - out time ,",
    "@xmath117 , @xmath28 switches from oscillating around @xmath118 to oscillating around @xmath119 ( with @xmath120 in this particular example ) , while @xmath21 begins to deviate from @xmath121 and joins with @xmath38 into combined oscillations around the constant @xmath122 .",
    "these fluctuations consist of the @xmath91 @xmath67-values oscillating independently around the vacua @xmath107 with frequency @xmath123 ( the mass in the true vacuum ) and amplitudes decreasing like @xmath31 , so @xmath21 and @xmath38 asymptotically oscillate with frequency @xmath124 with constant amplitudes .",
    "we can obtain an estimate for the number @xmath58 by the following consideration : as given in ( [ limit ] ) , for large proper times @xmath80 we expect @xmath28 to approach the limit @xmath125 which on the lattice comprises the kinks contribution to the energy . for proper times",
    "up to @xmath48 , @xmath126 , the integral @xmath127 is dominated by the constant contribution @xmath128 , i.e. we have @xmath129 . both constants ,",
    "@xmath128 before the transition , and @xmath130 after the transition , do not enter into the eom which describes the fluctuations around them and which determines the transition time @xmath48 . in normal time",
    "@xmath131 , energy conservation would require both constants to be equal . to translate that into the proper - time frame",

    "n_f = 2 n .",
    "so we obtain as an estimate for the number @xmath58 of kinks+antikinks expected to survive , [ nu ] n=. for this consideration the fluctuational contributions to @xmath21 and to @xmath28 are unimportant because they are suppressed by order @xmath132 , ( apart from the fact that they determine @xmath48 ) .",
    "the result ( [ nu ] ) is very simple and independent of @xmath54 ( and of @xmath95 and @xmath89 , if chosen sufficiently small ) .",
    "it may be noted that it is just one half of the purely statistical kibble limit @xmath133 .",
    "numerically , it can be measured as the average kink+antikink number @xmath134 obtained for a large ensemble of events .",
    "averaging over 1000 events we find a slight dependence on @xmath89 and @xmath95 : for @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 we have @xmath138 ; for @xmath87 and @xmath137 we find @xmath139 , respectively .",

    "( the numbers in brackets give the corresponding mean deviations ) .",
    "although the momentum cut - off implemented through the lattice ( which is decisive for the freeze - out time and instrumental for the occurrence of the transition ) can have a genuine physical meaning , it is still unsatisfactory that the shrinking kinks contribution to the energy , due to the finite lattice constant , is given by @xmath119 , and not by their true energy ( [ s3 ] ) @xmath140 which is independent of @xmath5 . to correct for that lattice artifact we can replace ( [ nlat ] ) by [ ntrue ] n_f = 2n and , with ( [ tf ] ) , obtain the result n= n which again is independent of @xmath54 .",
    "we shall see in the following that this is the appropriate procedure , if the freeze - out occurs before the soliton size has shrunk to the lattice - unit .",
    "we have seen from the preceding results that the momentum cut - off @xmath141 , here imposed on the system by the finite lattice constant @xmath103 , is crucial for the freeze - out time and for the onset of the phase transition .",
    "although , for the initial configurations chosen , the lattice constant does acquire physical meaning as the initial correlation length , it may seem very unsatisfactory that the essential physical processes rely on a rather arbitrarily chosen momentum cut - off .",
    "therefore it is more natural to introduce a cut - off @xmath142 through a temperature @xmath143 characterizing the initial distribution . for this purpose",
    "we construct the initial configurations @xmath67 ( @xmath144 ) on the lattice , as fourier transforms @xmath145 of distributions @xmath146 ( k=1, .. ,n ) in momentum space , chosen randomly from a gaussian deviate @xmath147 with @xmath99-dependent width @xmath148 , [ gausstemp ] f_g(_k)= ( - ) ,   _",

    "we need the correlation function @xmath154 , which now no longer factorizes , but instead is given by _",

    "if we use as an estimate for the average kink+antikink multiplicities @xmath58 the relation ( [ nlat ] ) we find [ ntlat ] n=(1-(-/2 ) ) .",
    "however , for small temperatures @xmath143 , the freeze - out time ( [ tftmp ] ) will be much shorter than the time @xmath156 when the kinks size approaches the lattice unit .",
    "so it appears more appropriate to replace ( [ nlat ] ) by ( [ ntrue ] ) , which accounts for the fact that at times @xmath157 the emerging ( and shrinking ) kinks energy is constant and given by @xmath158 .",
    "this leads to [ nttrue ] n = n(1-(-/2))^1/2 . for small temperatures",
    "this results in a square - root law for the multiplicities @xmath159 .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we compare the numerically measured @xmath134 ( averaged over 500 events , @xmath135 , @xmath86 ) as function of initial temperature @xmath143 with both expressions , ( [ ntlat ] ) and ( [ nttrue ] ) .",
    "evidently , using the shrinking kink s true constant energy @xmath158 , provides a good approximation for @xmath134 in the low - temperature region , while the use of the lattice expression @xmath160 describes only the limit where the temperature exceeds the cut - off @xmath142 in ( [ lamt ] ) .",
    "these results show that our expressions for the freeze - out time and the multiplicities @xmath58 work reasonably well , independently of the physical origin of the momentum cut - off .",
    "we shall therefore in the following return to the simple case where the momentum - cut - off is provided by the lattice constant .      up to now",
    "we have considered the sudden quench , i.e. the initial hot configuration was exposed from the outset @xmath161 to a fixed potential . in general , however , the @xmath0-potential would be of a form like [ vtemp ] v()= ( ^2-v^2())^2 with a time- ( or temperature- ) dependent function @xmath162 to drive the phase transition .",
    "typically , the functional dependence of @xmath163 on proper time @xmath5 would be like [ v2 ] v^2()= ( /_c-1 ) , parametrized by a cooling time @xmath164 which characterizes the time it takes the potential to approach its cold form . a possible scenario how the time - scale of this change in the effective chiral potential may be driven by a confining transition coupled to",

    "they approach the lower limit @xmath168 for @xmath169 .",
    "for very long cooling times @xmath170 , we have @xmath171 . in any case , if @xmath172 is smaller or comparable to @xmath156 , then also the freeze - out time @xmath48 is comparable to @xmath156 and we can apply equation ( [ nlat ] ) which determines the kink multiplicities . with the potential ( [ vtemp ] ) this is now modified as n v^4 _ f = ( 2v^2)^2 .",
    "so , with ( [ tftemp ] ) , we obtain the same result @xmath173 as before , independently of the value of @xmath174 .",
    "we conclude , that as long as the cooling time @xmath164 is smaller than the kinetic freeze - out limit @xmath156 , the resulting multiplicities are almost independent of @xmath164 , and it is justified to use the sudden quench approximation @xmath175 .",
    "this is no longer true for @xmath176 . in that case",
    "the potential ( [ vtemp ] ) is still symmetric with a single ( @xmath63 ) minimum at the time @xmath177 when all modes decouple .",
    "therefore , by the time @xmath178 when the potential develops its degenerate true minima with broken symmetry , all field variables @xmath67 roll down into the nearest minimum , independently of each other .",
    "so , for large cooling times , the average number @xmath134 will approach the kibble limit @xmath179 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows kink+antikink multiplicities @xmath134 ( averaged over 500 events ) as function of cooling time @xmath164 ( for @xmath86 , and for two different choices of the initial width @xmath180 and @xmath136 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath134 oscillates with @xmath181 ( the cold mass ) shows that the roll down proceeds only after the potential has essentially reached its final cold form .    physically , this is not interesting because the field variables @xmath67 at different lattice sites do not interact with each other for @xmath182 .",
    "we therefore in the following consider only the sudden quench @xmath183 .      at freeze - out the energy present in the rapidity interval",
    "is completely converted into kink - antikink pairs .",
    "after freeze - out the roll - down sets in , i.e. the field evolution is dominated by the potential .",
    "locally , the field picks up kinetic energy @xmath38 under the influence of the potential @xmath184 ( for @xmath185 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath186 is sufficiently small the equation of motion is + -=0 , solved by ( ) = c i_0()=c ( ) f ( ) . with @xmath187 a slowly monotonically decreasing function of @xmath188 .",
    "if @xmath95 is the ( average ) length of @xmath2 at @xmath48 , then the constant  @xmath189 is @xmath190 . for the typical roll - down time",
    "@xmath191 we take the time when @xmath192 is reached .",
    "so , we have [ t1ex ] ( _ 1-_f ) = -+ . as a first approximation we use [ t1 ]",
    "_ 1-_f = - .",
    "( this is a lower limit , because the omitted last term in ( [ t1ex ] ) is @xmath193 , and because for @xmath194 the 4-th order terms in @xmath106 become important .",
    "but for an estimate , ( [ t1 ] ) is good enough .",
    "the estimate should be best for small @xmath95 . ) during this time interval the spatial volume covered by the bjorken slab grows linearly with proper time .",
    "the local energy density is dominated by the constant @xmath195 , so by the end of the roll - down the additional energy @xmath196 is available to be converted into @xmath95-fluctuations around the true vacua @xmath107 .",
    "these fluctuations carry the mass @xmath197 .",
    "so , at the end of the evolution , in addition to the @xmath58 ( anti)kinks formed at freeze - out time , we find @xmath95-mesons emitted from the considered rapidity slab with multiplicity [ nsigma ] n_= = - . altogether , with @xmath173 from ( [ nu ] )",
    "we obtain for the multiplicity ratio of baryon - antibaryon pairs to @xmath95-mesons [ nratio ] = - which is independent of the coupling constant @xmath54 .    in fig.([fig2 ] ) , in addition to the arrow at freeze - out time @xmath198 another arrow shows the end - of - roll - down time @xmath199 , as given in ( [ t1 ] ) for @xmath200 .",
    "its intersection with the linearly rising @xmath201 defines the energy @xmath202 available at @xmath203 .",
    "it can be seen in fig.([fig2 ] ) that the straight horizontal line through this intersection coincides very closely with the actual numerically calculated total energy @xmath27 for times @xmath204 .",
    "( the contribution @xmath205 of the kinks is negligible ( on the lattice ) for @xmath206 ) .",
    "the last equation ( [ nratio ] ) holds for the initial configurations as described in ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "if we use the initial conditions ( [ gausstemp ] ) which involve a temperature cut - off in momentum space , we have instead , with ( [ nttrue ] ) , ( [ nsigma ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) = -(1-(-/2))^1/2 . for small values of @xmath207",
    "this reduces to = -()^1/2 .    with the potential of the true vacuum at @xmath107 put to zero , after the roll - down",
    "there is no further linear rise in the total energy of the expanding bjorken slab . remarkably , the @xmath208 law ( [ amplitudes ] ) of the amplitudes of the remaining vacuum fluctuations provides an asymptotically constant total energy @xmath209 , similar to the asymptotically constant ( exact ) energy stored in the shrinking kinks .",
    "we have seen that in the bjorken frame the onset of a phase transition , together with the freeze - out of independent kinks , antikinks , and mesonic fluctuations around the true vacua , is basically governed by the momentum cut - off which characterizes the system .",
    "the cooling of the system originates in the decrease of effective wave numbers @xmath98 with increasing proper time @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to this kinetic cooling we normally would expect also genuine physical cooling to occur due to radiative processes which dissipate energy from the excited system into the surrounding vacuum .",
    "we incorporate this effect by including a finite dissipation constant @xmath39 into the eom ( [ 14 ] ) as described in section ii.c . during the early phase of an evolution ,",
    "up to the onset of a transition , this does not affect the linear rise of @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , the dissipation damps away the rapidity and proper time gradients such that their smooth sum @xmath22 drops below the @xmath79 line .",
    "therefore the freeze - out time @xmath48 is reduced as compared to the case @xmath210 .",
    "correspondingly , the average number @xmath134 of kinks+antikinks produced is also reduced . as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig5 ] shows the evolution of one event for @xmath211 ( with @xmath212 ) .",
    "this event leads to @xmath213 kinks+antikinks . applying the approximation ( [ l2approx ] ) ( with @xmath214 ) for an average @xmath43 , ( which in figure  [ fig5 ] is shown by the solid line )",
    ", we find as in ( [ freeze ] ) from its intersection with the linearly rising @xmath215 the freeze - out time @xmath216 ( as compared to @xmath198 for @xmath210 ) . at this early time",
    "the emerging kinks have not yet shrunk to lattice - unit size , so we use their true constant energy @xmath217 to extract from the total energy @xmath27 at time @xmath48 their multiplicity @xmath218 . in figure  [ fig5",
    "] this is indicated by the horizontal line at @xmath219 , which may be seen to intersect @xmath27 ( which near @xmath48 is dominated by the linear rise of potential @xmath29 ) near proper time @xmath48 . the roll - down phase which follows for @xmath112",
    "is characterized by a peak in the proper time derivatives @xmath38 , followed by a rapid decrease in @xmath21 , as the configuration settles in the true vacua .",
    "finally the total energy is dominated by the ( lattice - artifact kink energies ) @xmath220 behaviour of @xmath28 for @xmath213 . during and after the roll - down phase all fluctuations",
    "have been damped away by the dissipative term .",
    "this pattern changes for very large values of the dissipation constant @xmath39 . as @xmath221 approaches unity ,",
    "the proper time derivatives @xmath38 get strongly suppressed already from the beginning of the evolution such that @xmath38 stays small and @xmath28 dominates the total energy . for @xmath222 , @xmath28",
    "is determined by its initial value alone , it approaches the line [ l_2f ] l_2= n , i.e. it takes twice the value ( [ l_2 ] ) it has for @xmath210 .",
    "correspondingly , the average number @xmath134 of kinks+antikinks approaches the kibble limit @xmath223 .",
    "in other words , the field configuration is basically frozen from the very beginning at @xmath46 , the evolution consists only of the field variables @xmath67 at each lattice point drifting to the nearest true minimum at @xmath107 .",
    "so , in that limit , the notion of a freeze - out time becomes meaningless .",
    "still it is interesting to employ the analytical expression ( [ l2approx ] ) for @xmath43 to determine @xmath48 from [ ff ] = n ^2 _ f , and the number @xmath58 of kinks+antikinks from ( [ ntrue ] ) [ nftrue ] n",
    "= n _ f. this provides the limits @xmath224 for @xmath225 , and @xmath226 for @xmath222 and a minimum of @xmath58 near @xmath227 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the resulting @xmath58 as function of the dissipation constant @xmath39 , for @xmath214 , in comparison with the numerically measured @xmath134 ( averaged over 1000 events , for @xmath86 , @xmath228 and two values for the width of the initial distribution @xmath87 and @xmath229 ) .",
    "although the general features of @xmath134 are nicely reproduced , the limits for @xmath225 and @xmath222 are not correct .",
    "this is no surprise because in both limits the true kink energy @xmath230 should be replaced by the lattice result , i.e. ( [ nftrue ] ) should be replaced by ( [ nlat ] ) [ nflat ] n = n_f^2 .",
    "this then leads to the correct ( lattice ) limits @xmath231 for @xmath225 , and @xmath232 for @xmath222 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a quite satisfactory parametrization of the results can be obtained by using ( [ nflat ] ) for all values of @xmath39 , but replacing @xmath43 on the left - hand side of ( [ ff ] ) by [ l2var ] = _ f. this comparison is also shown in fig.[fig6 ] , again for @xmath214 .",
    "evidently , it provides remarkably good agreement for @xmath39-values up to @xmath233 .      for large values of the dissipation constant @xmath39 it should be sufficient to employ the adiabatic approximation as described in section ii.d .",
    "evolving the initial configurations with the purely dissipative eom ( [ 17 ] ) , leads to the kink+antikink multiplicities @xmath134 ( averaged over 1000 events , for @xmath135 , and @xmath86 ) shown in figure [ fig7 ] for two initial times @xmath137 ( and initial gaussian width @xmath136 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the non - adiabatic results for the same two cases are included .",
    "it is apparent that the adiabatic approximation works very well for @xmath234 .",
    "it can also be observed that for @xmath235 the adiabatic evolutions produce no kinks at all , i.e. the configurations become so smooth at a very early time ( when the size of the kinks is still very large ) , such that the complete configuration rolls down into the same true minimum .",
    "the solid lines show the result of the analytical approximation ( [ nflat]),([l2var ] ) for both cases @xmath137 .",
    "the dynamics of interacting fields in rapidly expanding systems is characterized by effective wave numbers decreasing with time .",
    "this is conveniently modeled by transforming from space - time @xmath236 to the rapidity - proper - time @xmath237 ( bjorken ) frame . in the equations of motion for",
    "the evolving fields , the rapidity gradients then explicitly carry the inverse proper - time factors , and an additional first - order proper - time derivative term appears which resembles dissipative dynamics , although no genuine physical dissipation is present . in the @xmath237 frame ,",
    "the system still is characterized by a lagrangian which , however , explicitly depends on proper time .",
    "so , the energy is not conserved , but may decrease or rise during the evolution of a field configuration .",
    "this is especially interesting for those cases where the system is able to undergo a phase transition , where initial configurations through a cooling process settle down into the true vacua .",
    "usually , cooling or heating is provided by energy exchange with external degrees of freedom ( heat bath ) , but in the @xmath237 frame the transition is solely driven by proper time .",
    "systems characterized by multiple different degenerate vacua are of specific interest because during the course of the phase transition it must be decided how the different vacua get populated .",
    "field configurations connecting different vacua will finally show up as defects , kinks , or solitons , and their multiplicities can be physically significant and observable .",
    "the mechanism of how the transition is effectuated by proper time in the bjorken frame is quite transparent .",
    "the term which comprises the ( rapidity-)gradients contribution @xmath28 to the total energy carries a factor @xmath59 , while the potential - energy part @xmath21 carries a factor @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the evolutions at very early times will be dominated by @xmath28 independently of the potential , while , if the gradients in the field configurations are limited by a momentum - cut - off  @xmath238 , then for very late times the gradients will become unimportant , propagation in rapidity space will end , and the field variables evolve locally according to the local potential . evidently , there will exist a freeze - out time @xmath48 which separates both regimes .",
    "it is conveniently defined as the time when @xmath28 equals @xmath21 ( where suitable care has to be taken to subtract eventual constants in the definition of the interaction ) .",
    "clearly , the momentum cut - off ( or the finiteness of @xmath28 ) is a necessary condition for the transition to occur , and the actual value of the freeze - out time will depend decisively on @xmath238 .",
    "therefore it is important that the momentum cut - off reflects a genuine physical characteristic of the initial field ensemble , typically an initial temperature or inverse correlation length .",
    "this then , however , implies that the freeze - out time can be calculated very simply from the initial ensemble .",
    "stable solitons in the bjorken frame shrink with increasing proper time , or , in other words , their stable size relative to the expanding system decreases .",
    "but remarkably , their total energy is constant and equal to their static total energy in the usual ( z , t ) frame .",
    "this allows to estimate their multiplicities from the total energy available at freeze - out time ( including eventual constants in the definition of the interaction ) .",
    "this means that we may obtain estimates for the average soliton(+antisoliton ) multiplicities directly from the form of the initial ensemble and the static lagrangian which determines their mass .",
    "a convenient way to introduce a momentum cut - off is to implement the system on a lattice .",
    "then , however , we have to make sure that the lattice cut - off does not interfere with the increasing gradients which characterize the shrinking solitons at @xmath48 .",
    "alternatively , we have to use the lattice expression for the soliton s energy if it has shrunk to lattice - unit size .",
    "we have investigated these features in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0-model .",
    "we find that the simple analytical expressions for @xmath48 and @xmath58 agree very nicely with numerically measured freeze - out times and kink+antikink multiplicities .",
    "we have also used boltzmann ensembles with temperatures well below and up to the lattice cut - off . employing the appropriate correlation function",
    "we again find good agreement with the numerical averages . for low temperatures we obtain a square - root law @xmath239 . for temperatures approaching the lattice cut - off",
    "the influence of the appropriate soliton energy becomes evident .",
    "we show that within the physically interesting region it is sufficient to consider the sudden quench where the initial ensemble is exposed from the beginning to the fixed cold potential . after the freeze - out the additional energy picked up by the expanding rapidity slice",
    "is converted into mesonic fluctuations . a simple estimate of the roll - down time provides an expression for their average multiplicities .",
    "in addition to the free evolutions in the bjorken frame we have also investigated the inclusion of additional genuine dissipation with variable damping constant @xmath39 .",
    "it is very satisfactory to find that all the previous considerations can be applied to this case , that the decrease in the freeze - out times caused by the damping can be represented in simple analytical expressions and that the multiplicities @xmath58 again reflect the soliton energies at freeze - out time .",
    "finally we find that the validity of the adiabatic approximation , ( where all second order time - derivatives are dropped ) , is limited by @xmath240 where @xmath89 denotes the proper time at which the initial ensemble is prepared and the evolution starts",
    ".    it will be most interesting to look at the corresponding features in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional o(4)-model considered previously as a model for baryon - antibaryon production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions and compare the results with recent experimentally observed nucleon - antinucleon multiplicities and with statistical models .",
