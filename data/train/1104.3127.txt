    "from interactions of stars in galaxies to particle beams in high energy accelerators , hamiltonian mechanics is found at the very heart of modeling and understanding dynamical processes . the necessity to classify evermore complex systems in terms of stability and predictability has lead to a wealth of methods discriminating chaotic from regular behavior ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect .  7 ) ) .",
    "most of these techniques rely on the study of the time evolution of deviation vectors of a given orbit to discriminate between the two regimes .",
    "the time evolution of these vectors is governed by the so - called variational equations .    in @xcite the ` tangent map ' ( tm ) technique ,",
    "an efficient and easy to implement method for the integration of the variational equations of hamiltonian systems based on the use of symplectic integrators was introduced . in @xcite",
    "the tm method was applied mainly to low - dimensional hamiltonian systems of 2 and 3 degrees of freedom , and proved to be very efficient and superior to other commonly used numerical schemes , both with respect to its accuracy and its speed .",
    "the scope of the present work is to extend these results by investigating whether the efficiency of the tm method persists also when multi - dimensional hamiltonian systems are considered .",
    "the study of such systems presents a challenging numerical task , which makes the use of fast and accurate numerical tools imperative . in the present paper we use as a toy model the famous fermi - pasta - ulam @xmath0 ( fpu-@xmath0 ) lattice , which is presented in sect .",

    "[ sec : num_methods ] the different numerical methods we use , i.e.  the generalized alignment index ( gali ) chaos indicator , the tm method and the saba family of symplectic integrators , the taylor series integrator tides , and the general - purpose high - accuracy runge - kutta integrator dop853 , are presented and their properties are briefly discussed . then , in sect .",
    "[ sec : efficiency ] the numerical results of the application of these numerical schemes for the integration of variational equations of the fpu system are presented , while in sect .",

    "as a model of a multi - dimensional hamiltonian system we consider the fpu-@xmath0 lattice @xcite , which describes a chain of @xmath1 particles with nearest neighbor interaction . regarding numerical integration algorithms , the fpu lattice is a very challenging problem , since it exhibits oscillations on largely different time scales .",

    "we note that in @xcite the particular case @xmath9 was studied in detail .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : fpuham ] ) can be split into two parts @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which respectively depend only on the momenta and the coordinates , i.  e.  @xmath12 .",
    "the hamilton s equations of motion are @xmath13 with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denoting the kronecker delta , which is equal to 1 if @xmath16 and to 0 otherwise .",
    "the variational equations governing the time evolution of a deviation vector @xmath17 , that evolves in the tangent space of the hamiltonian s phase space are given by @xmath18",
    "in order to compute the stability of a particular solution of hamiltonian ( [ eq : fpuham ] ) , or in other words of an orbit in the 2@xmath1-dimensional phase space of the system , the equations of motion ( [ eq : fpueq ] ) have to be integrated together with the variational equations ( [ eq : fpuvareq ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of the latter contains information on the stability of the orbit , which can be quantified by using some chaos indicator , for example the galis .",
    "different numerical approaches can be used to solve the system of ordinary differential equations given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fpueq ] ) and ( [ eq : fpuvareq ] ) . in this section , after briefly recalling the definition of the gali and its behavior for regular and chaotic motion , we present an overview of the methods used in the current study .",
    "a more detailed description of further possibilities based on symplectic methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "the gali was originally introduced in @xcite as an efficient chaos detection method , generalizing a similar indicator called the smaller alignment index ( sali ) @xcite .",
    "the method has been applied successfully to different dynamical systems for the discrimination between regular and chaotic motion , as well as for the detection of regular motion on low dimensional tori @xcite .    for @xmath1d hamiltonians the generalized alignment index of order @xmath19 ( gali@xmath20 ) , @xmath21 ,",
    "is determined through the evolution of @xmath19 initially linearly independent deviation vectors @xmath22 , which are continually normalized , keeping their directions intact . according to @xcite gali@xmath20",
    "is defined as the volume of the @xmath19-parallelepiped having the @xmath19 unitary deviation vectors @xmath23 , @xmath24 , as edges .",
    "gali@xmath20 is therefore determined through the wedge product of these vectors @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting the usual norm .",
    "the behavior of gali@xmath20 for regular motion on an @xmath27-dimensional torus is given by @xcite @xmath28 while for chaotic orbits gali@xmath29 tends to zero _ exponentially _ following the law @xcite @xmath30 t } , \\label{eq : gali_chaos}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the first @xmath19 largest lyapunov characteristic exponents of the orbit .",
    "we chose to apply the gali method in order to check the accuracy of the numerical integration of variational equations because this index depends on the evolution of an ensemble of deviation vectors .",
    "thus , even small errors in the integration of these vectors are expected to significantly influence the evolution of galis . in particular , we focus our attention on regular orbits lying on tori of various dimensions @xmath27 , for which the galis exhibit different evolutions depending on @xmath27 and the order @xmath19 of the index .",
    "the possible deviations of numerically evaluated galis from their expected behaviors ( [ eq : gali_order_all ] ) will identify the inaccurate integration of the deviation vectors far better than it would be the case using chaotic orbits , for which all galis tend to zero exponentially ( [ eq : gali_chaos ] ) . throughout the paper",
    "we denote regular orbits on an @xmath27-dimensional torus of the @xmath1d system ( [ eq : fpuham ] ) as @xmath32 , where @xmath27 can range from 2 to @xmath1 .",
    "symplectic methods are often the preferred choice when integrating dynamical problems , which can be described by hamiltonian functions . a thorough discussion of such methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us just mention some properties of symplectic integrators which are of interest for our study .",
    "symplectic methods can not be used with a trivial automated step size control . as a consequence",
    ", they are usually implemented with a fixed integration step @xmath33 . due to their special structure",
    "they preserve the symplectic nature of hamilton s equations intrinsically , which in turn leads to results that are more robust for long integration times .",
    "a side - effect of structure preservation is that the error in energy remains bounded irrespective of the total integration time .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that it is possible to integrate the hamilton s equations of motion and the corresponding variational equations using the tm technique based on symplectic splitting methods .",
    "let us outline the basic idea behind the tm method , which is founded on a general result stated for example in @xcite : symplectic integrators can be applied to systems of first order differential equations @xmath34 , that can be written in the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are differential operators defined as @xmath37 and for which the two systems @xmath38 and @xmath39 are integrable . here",
    "@xmath40 are poisson brackets of functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 defined as : @xmath43 the set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fpueq ] ) is one example of such a system , since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : fpuham ] ) can be divided into two integrable parts @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath44 as already noted .",
    "a symplectic splitting method separates the equations of motion ( [ eq : fpueq ] ) into several parts , applying either the operator @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "these are the equations of motion of the hamiltonians @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which can be solved analytically , giving explicit mappings over the time step @xmath47 , where the constants @xmath48 are chosen to optimize the accuracy of the integrator .",
    "these mappings can then be combined to approximate the solution for a time step @xmath33 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the derivatives of these mappings with respect to the coordinates and momenta of the system ( the so - called tangent maps ) can be used to calculate the time evolution of deviation vectors or , in other words , solve the variational equations ( [ eq : fpuvareq ] ) .    in @xcite a family of symplectic splitting methods called saba@xmath49 and sbab@xmath49",
    "was introduced , with @xmath50 being the number of applications of operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these integrators were designed to have only positive intermediate steps . since it is not possible to construct symplectic integrators of order , if it introduces an error of @xmath51 in the approximation of the real solution , with @xmath33 being the integration time step . ]",
    "@xmath52 with this property @xcite , small negative corrector steps @xmath53 can be added before and after the main body of the integrator to further increase the accuracy . in sect .  [",
    "sec : efficiency ] we test 3 different integrators , namely saba@xmath54 , saba@xmath54c and sbab@xmath54c , present the results of this comparison and discuss the characteristics of these algorithms when applied to the fpu system .    the fact , that standard adaptive stepping policy is not possible with symplectic integration schemes necessitates an initial assessment of stability for the algorithms used , in order to derive an upper bound on the choice of step - size . following @xcite we note that sbab@xmath55 is equivalent to the well known strmer - verlet or leap - frog method , and saba@xmath55 to its adjoint . in order to perform a linear stability analysis of the fpu-@xmath0 lattice problem for saba@xmath54",
    ", we introduce normal mode momenta @xmath56 and coordinates @xmath57 as it was done for example in @xcite .",

    "to be of modulus one , given the harmonic frequencies ( [ harmen ] ) satisfy @xmath66 , the maximum admissible step - size for saba@xmath54 will be @xmath67 .",
    "thus , in our study we always use @xmath68 .",
    "the basic idea of the so - called taylor series methods is to approximate the solution at time @xmath69 of a given @xmath70-dimensional initial value problem @xmath71 from the @xmath72 degree taylor series of @xmath73 at @xmath74 : @xmath75 for details see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "i.8 ) and references therein . in this work",
    "we call an integrator being of order @xmath50 , when the first neglected term in this taylor series expansion is of @xmath76 . the computation of the derivatives can be very cumbersome , depending on the structure of @xmath77 , and is done efficiently using automatic differentiation techniques ( see for example @xcite ) .    in @xcite two different publicly available implementations of the taylor method were used and compared regarding their reliability and efficiency in the case of a @xmath78d hamiltonian system",
    ". one of these integrators , called tides @xcite , which showed better performance , will also be used in this work as a representative of methods based on taylor series expansions .",
    "tides comes as a _ mathematica _ notebook . after inserting the differential equations one desires to integrate , the notebook generates automatically all the necessary subroutines to compute the given problem .",
    "the fortran code produced by tides was included into the existing testbed of our work without further modification .    in order to obtain optimal results ,",
    "the tides algorithm is free to choose its order and step size during the whole integration interval .",
    "we used one parameter only , the so - called one step accuracy @xmath79 , to control the numerical performance of the algorithm . to be more precise , an integration step from time @xmath80 to @xmath69 is accepted , if the internal accuracy checks estimate that the local truncation error of the solution @xmath81 is less than @xmath79 . if this error is too large , the integrator automatically tries to increase the internal order and/or adjust the step size @xmath33 .",
    "after each successful step the deviation vectors are re - normalized .",
    "let us remark that another elegant way to express eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor_series ] ) can be achieved using the so called lie series formalism .",
    "lie series have been rediscovered by @xcite and used extensively in the field of dynamical astronomy ( e.g. @xcite ) to numerically solve ordinary differential equations .",
    "sharing the same ansatz with symplectic maps ( sect .",
    "[ sec : tm ] ) , lie series can be used to iterate first order ordinary differential equations of the form @xmath82 as follows : @xmath83 note that contrary to sect .",
    "[ sec : tm ] no assumptions on the properties of the differential operator are made .",
    "thus , by evaluating the consecutive derivatives @xmath84 and building the corresponding exponential series up to order @xmath50 one is able to follow the trajectory of @xmath85 through phase space .",
    "the truncated lie series numerical map @xmath86 is not area - preserving , in general , since the method is non - symplectic .",
    "therefore , the implementation of an adaptive step - size into lie series algorithms is possible without reservations .",
    "this can be achieved via estimates on the size of the remainder of the exponential series ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "algorithms using series expansions become most efficient when combined with recursion relations , where higher order derivatives can be calculated from previous ones . in the course of this work , also extensive tests have been undertaken to adapt the lie series method to the fpu-@xmath0 lattice .",
    "since for this problem such recursions are not available , we used algebraic manipulation software to compute the successive applications of the operator @xmath87 to @xmath88 , and implemented the generated code into a fortran program . since this approach proved to be reliable but computationally very expensive , we do not include it in the discussion of our results in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .      in general ,",
    "the computation of higher derivatives of functions @xmath89 soon becomes very complicated .",
    "therefore , the methods described in sect .  [ sec : tides ] became popular only recently , after automatic differentiation could be performed efficiently by computers . before that",
    ", other methods were developed to approximate eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor_series ] ) .",
    "one of these are the so called runge - kutta methods ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii.1.1 ) ) .",
    "an @xmath27-stage runge - kutta method is given as @xmath90 the real numbers @xmath91 with @xmath92 are chosen to approximate eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor_series ] ) to the desired order .",
    "if one requires further @xmath93 for @xmath94 the integration method will be explicit .",
    "runge - kutta integrators exist as symplectic as well as non - symplectic variants .    in this work a 12-stage explicit runge - kutta integration method called dop853",
    "this non - symplectic scheme is based on the method of dormand and price ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii.5 ) for further details ) . with this integrator",
    "we solve the set of differential equations composed of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fpueq ] ) and ( [ eq : fpuvareq ] ) simultaneously .",
    "here we use again the parameter @xmath79 to control the integrator s overall behavior . for the dop853 integrator the estimation of the local error and the step size control",
    "is based on embedded formulas of orders 5 and 3 .",
    "before investigating how variational equations can be integrated efficiently , one should first clarify the meaning of the term ` efficiency ' .",
    "on the one hand , an efficient integration is one that is performed as fast as possible , and on the other hand , this computation should be also done as accurately as possible . since accuracy always comes at the cost of intense computational efforts meaning large cpu times it tends to contradict the first mentioned aspect of efficiency .",
    "in addition , since we are especially interested in the computation of chaos indicators , an accurate computation should imply the correct distinction between regular and chaotic orbits of the studied dynamical system .",
    "thus , in this work we consider the integration of variational equations to be efficient , when the computed galis are obtained with the least - possible cpu time requirements , achieving at the same time the correct characterization of orbits as regular or chaotic .    in the next section we present a thorough discussion of how variational equations can be integrated numerically using the methods described in sect .",
    "[ sec : num_methods ] .",
    "we explain possibilities of estimating the accuracy of such computations and discuss the obtained results with respect to our definition of efficiency . in sect .",
    "[ sec : resultsfpu ] we apply this knowledge for a more global investigation of the properties of the fpu-@xmath0 lattice . as a final remark",
    "we note that all presented computations were performed on an intel xeon x3470 with 2.93 ghz , using extended precision ( 80 bit ) .      in most applications it is common to integrate the variational equations together with the equations of motion they are based on .",
    "thus , an important prerequisite to obtain correct stability results is the correct computation of the dynamics of the system itself .",
    "for this reason we first discuss the properties of the integrators described in sect .",
    "[ sec : num_methods ] when applied to some specific orbits of the fpu-@xmath0 lattice .",
    "in general , an accuracy estimate of a numerically obtained orbit of a dynamical system can be given via monitoring how well the system s first integrals ( e.g.  the total energy , total linear momentum etc . )",
    "are conserved . for conservative hamiltonian systems , like ( [ eq : fpuham ] )",
    ", this can be done easily by checking the conservation of the energy @xmath95 itself .",
    "the absolute value of the relative errors of the total energy @xmath96 , for different integrators and step sizes @xmath33 , for a @xmath97 orbit over @xmath98 time units are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "for non - symplectic methods also the one - step accuracy @xmath79 is mentioned .",
    "[ htb ]    firstly , we focus on the application of the tm method with the saba and sbab integrators .",
    "the corresponding results are given in the first 5 lines in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "comparing the energy conservation between saba@xmath54 and saba@xmath54c one finds that the use of the corrector steps significantly improves @xmath96 for the same step size of @xmath99 .",
    "this result can of course be explained by the fact that saba@xmath54 is an integration scheme of order 2 , while saba@xmath54c is of order 4 . reducing the step size for saba@xmath54c to @xmath100",
    "further improves the energy conservation as expected .",
    "we note that this reduction leads to a linear growth by a factor 5 of the required cpu time , as expected .",
    "since saba@xmath54c shows the best performance , we use only this integrator for further investigations .    comparing the results of saba@xmath54c with the ones obtained by the non - symplectic methods tides and",
    "dop853 one finds that both non - symplectic methods need more cpu time in order to reach the same final value of @xmath96 .",
    "if one computes a mean step size for these algorithms , defined as the total integration time @xmath101 divided by the number of accepted steps @xmath102 , one finds that both integrators achieve this final energy error by a larger mean step size , compared to saba@xmath54c , which is due to the higher orders of these integrators .",
    "while the highest order for dop853 is fixed to 8 , tides uses automatic order selection , which explains the larger mean time step for the same value of one - step accuracy @xmath79 .",
    "while monitoring energy conservation serves as a control parameter over the state vector of the system itself , it lacks information on how accurately the corresponding variational equations are solved .",
    "if the stability of certain initial conditions is known , one can use the theoretically predicted behaviors ( [ eq : gali_order_all ] ) of the gali chaos indicator to estimate the reliability of the numerical computation .",
    "therefore , in the last column of table  [ tab1 ] , we provide information on whether the integration was able to identify the @xmath97 orbit correctly as being a regular orbit lying on a 2-dimensional torus .    the time evolution of gali@xmath20 , @xmath103 , for some of the runs of table  [ tab1 ] is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] . from eq .",

    "it is found that @xmath110 leads to a similar error in energy conservation , but is not sufficient for the correct computation of the galis ( see the first and third columns of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . decreasing the one - step accuracy @xmath79",
    "improves the accuracy , but the integrations become less and less efficient compared to the tm integration as the required cpu time grows . we note that a correct dynamical characterization of the orbit is possible both for the dop853 and tides for @xmath111 .    using energy conservation as an indicator for",

    "this orbit is indeed a @xmath97 regular orbit as we see from the evolution of its galis shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) . in a similar way",
    ", a @xmath143 orbit should be located in regions colored in black only in the @xmath144 plot of fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) .",
    "an orbit of this type is the one with @xmath145 , @xmath146 denoted by a square in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which actually evolves on a 3-dimensional torus , as only its gali@xmath54 and gali@xmath104 remain constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ) . finally , the orbit with @xmath147 , @xmath148 ( denoted by a circle in fig .  [ fig5 ] ) inside a region of the phase space colored in yellow or light red in all panels of fig .  [ fig5 ] , is a regular orbit on a 4-dimensional torus and its gali@xmath54 , gali@xmath104 and gali@xmath105 remain constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ) .",
    "it is worth noting , that chaotic motion would lead to very small gali@xmath20 and @xmath140 values , since all galis would tend to zero exponentially , and consequently would correspond to regions colored in black in _ all _ panels of fig .",
    "thus , chaotic motion can be easily distinguished from regular motion on low - dimensional tori .    from the results of figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] it becomes evident that the comparison of color plots of ` normalized gali@xmath20 ' values can facilitate the tracing of low - dimensional tori .",
    "the construction of such plots becomes a very demanding computational task , especially for high - dimensional systems .",
    "thus , the application of the tm method for obtaining such results becomes imperative , since the required computations can be performed very efficiently by this method .",
    "we compared different numerical techniques for the integration of variational equations of multi - dimensional hamiltonian systems .",
    "in particular , we considered the tm method , which uses symplectic integrators for the realization of this task , as well as non - symplectic algorithms , like the general - purpose runge - kutta integrator dop853 , and the tides algorithm , which relies on taylor series expansion techniques .",
    "these methods were applied to the @xmath1d hamiltonian system ( [ eq : fpuham ] ) , the fpu-@xmath0 lattice , with @xmath1 varying from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "we used the numerically obtained solutions of the variational equations for the computation of the gali chaos indicators .",
    "the accurate reproduction of theoretically known behaviors of galis was used as a measure of reliability of the numerical techniques tested .",
    "in addition , the cpu time required by each method in order to achieve accurate results , was taken into account for the characterization of the efficiency of these algorithms .",
    "the tm method exhibited the best numerical performance in all our simulations , both in accuracy and speed .",
    "more specifically , we found that the ratio of the cpu time required by the tides and dop853 algorithms , with respect to the tm method , for correctly characterizing the nature of orbits , increased with increasing @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the tm method should be preferred over the other two techniques , especially for studies of multi - dimensional systems .",
    "a feature of the tm method , which is of significant practical importance , is that it succeeds in finding the correct gali behavior , and consequently determines the nature of orbits correctly , even when large integration steps are used , despite the fact that in these cases the energy accuracy is rather low .",
    "therefore , the application of the tm method allows the efficient investigation of the dynamical properties of a large number of initial conditions in feasible cpu times . as an example",
    ", we showed in sect .",
    "[ sec : resultsfpu ] how the tm method can exploit the properties of gali to efficiently find the location of low dimensional tori in the phase space .",
    "possible applications of this approach could be the tracing of quasiperiodic motion in multi - dimensional systems , when only a few degrees of freedom are excited .",
