    "spin flow in nanostructures has recently attracted considerable interest in the scientific community@xcite .",
    "the vision of magnetoelectronics and spintronics is to inject , manipulate and detect spins in nanostructures which can give new functionality in electronic devices .",
    "the spin flow can be controlled by _",
    "e.g. _ external electric or magnetic fields .",
    "a hall voltage builds up perpendicularly to the current flow under an applied magnetic field in normal metals due to the lorentz force .",
    "the hall voltage increases with applied magnetic field .",
    "magnetoelectronic circuits are often realized by using ferromagnets that can spin polarize the current flow . in ferromagnets",
    ", there is an anomalous hall voltage proportional to the magnetization , _",
    "e.g. _ a transverse charge potential , even in the absence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "the anomalous hall effect is caused by the spin - orbit interaction , which correlates the momentum of the electron with its spin .",
    "this causes an dependence of the electron flow with the relative angle between its direction and the non - zero magnetic order parameter in ferromagnets.@xcite in ferromagnetic metals , spin - orbit interaction is also a source of crystalline magnetic anisotropy energies since the spin - orbit interaction couples the magnetization with the crystal structure .",
    "the scattering mechanisms responsible for the anomalous hall effect are skew scattering@xcite and side - jump scattering@xcite as well as the anomalous velocity operator due to spin - orbit interaction and impurity scattering . a schematic picture of the skew scattering mechanism is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skew ] . after scattering off the impurity potential",
    ", there is a spin - dependent probability difference , represented by small angles , of the electron trajectories .",
    "this leads _",
    "e.g. _ to a slightly larger chance that electrons with spin up moves upwards and electrons with spin down moves downwards after scattering .",
    "the side - jump mechanism is also caused by the combined spin - orbit and impurity scattering , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sidejump ] . after scattering off the impurity , a small `` side - jump '' , develops between the trajectories of electrons with spin up and down far away from the scattering center .",
    "additionally , the spin - orbit interaction does not commute with the electron momentum operator .",
    "this leads to an anomalous velocity operator that can contribute to the hall effects , as well .",
    "spin - orbit scattering is also important in normal metals .",
    "it is well known that it causes a loss of spin coherence .",
    "hirsch predicted the existence of a novel spin hall effect@xcite analogues to the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnets and developed a phenomenological theory for the effect . in the absence of spin - orbit scattering , electrons with spin - up and spin - down scatter equally on non - magnetic impurities .",
    "however , as seen above , for nonzero spin - orbit interaction , when a current passes through the sample an imbalance between left - moving and right - moving particles is established , and an accompanying transverse spin accumulation potential builds up in the system .",
    "zhang computed this spin potential in the diffusive transport regime , and found that it should be measurable @xcite .",
    "he considered longitudinal transport in a thin normal metal film , and computed the resulting transverse spin hall voltage . in this regime ,",
    "the spin - accumulation is weak and he found that the spin hall voltage is governed by the anomalous velocity operator . by using the framework developed by hirsch and zhang , effects of contact resistances on the spin hall effect have also been considered@xcite .",
    "spin - orbit scattering is also important in @xmath0- and @xmath1-doped semiconductors , where rashba - type spin - orbit coupling@xcite leads to interesting spin hall effects@xcite .",
    "the most interesting case is spin transport in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) .",
    "the study of this effect is controversial .",
    "the debate@xcite is focused on whether or not the spin hall conductivity has a universal value @xmath2 and in what regime this result is applicable .",
    "our study is complementary to these studies of spin hall effects in semiconductors . in our normal metal case ,",
    "the extrinsic@xcite spin hall effects arise due to the spin - orbit at impurities . in semiconductors ,",

    ", we derive the spin hall effects in the presense of spin diffusion from the eilenberger equation@xcite in presence of spin - orbit coupling@xcite , magnetic impurities and non - magnetic impurities .",
    "we use the keldysh green function technique in the quasiclassical approximation .",
    "our calculations go beyond the assumptions in ref .",
    ", which only included effects of the anomalous velocity operator , in that we rigorously derive diffusion equations that also include effects of skew scattering and side - jump scattering .",
    "our results agree with the results by zhang in the limit he considered , where skew scattering and side - jump scattering can be disregarded .",
    "we also consider spin and charge transport in normal metals in another transport regime , phenomenologically treated by hirsch , when normal metals are biased by ferromagnets , in which spins accumulate in the normal metal even in the absence of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we demonstrate that in this regime , skew scattering and side - jump scattering can not be disregarded , and compute the spin hall and spin - orbit induced charge hall effects . in our analysis , we also consider transport through ferromagnet - normal metal interfaces beyond the assumptions in ref . by using the boundary conditions obtained within magneto - electronic circuit theory , which is necessary in dealing with non - collinear spin and magnetization directions",
    "finally , our formalism also explicitly incorporates the effects of scattering off magnetic impurities , which can reduce the spin hall effects .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in the next section , section [ normet ] ,",
    "we outline our starting point microscopic hamiltonian , and explain the diffusion equations for spin and charge flow that we have obtained rigorously by using the non - equilibrium keldysh green function approach in the quasi - classical approximation .",

    "we are interested in the transport properties of diffusive system where the system size is much larger than the mean free path .",
    "a rigorous method to obtain the correct diffusion equation is to start from a microscopic description using the non - equilibrium keldysh formalism .",
    "we consequently employ the keldysh approach with two approximations .",

    "after considerably algebra outlined in section [ micro ] , we find that the resulting diffusion equation for the charge distribution functions is simply @xmath24 similarly , the spin - distribution for small spin - orbit interactions , @xmath25 , is governed by @xmath26 \\bm \\mu_{\\text{s } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the diffusion coefficient in terms of the fermi velocity @xmath28 and the elastic scattering time @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the spin - flip relaxation time due to the spin - orbit interaction , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the spin - flip relaxation time due to magnetic impurities , @xmath33 here we have expressed the strength of the magnetic impurity potential from eq .",

    "we also derive expressions for the total current in case of arbitary @xmath43 ( see section [ micro ] ) .",

    "that means that the spin - accumulation is small , being induced by the spin - orbit interaction . from ( [ ii-70 ] ) ,",
    "( [ ii-90 ] ) and ( [ ii-100 ] ) we thus see that contributions from the skew scattering and side - jump scattering to the current are of a higher order in the spin - orbit scattering than the anomalous current and can be disregarded . in the case of pure normal metals , in the weak spin - orbit interaction limit , the current can thus simply be expressed in terms of @xmath51 where the anomalous current simplifies to @xmath52 the effect of the spin - orbit interaction is consequently to induce a transverse spin hall potential .",

    "if the system size is smaller than the spin - diffusion length , a spin accumulation can not build up within the system , and consequently the spin hall effect vanishes .",

    "the solution of the diffusion equation is similar to the treatment in ref . .",

    "when magnetic impurity scattering is weak , and in the limit of a wider film than the spin - diffusion length @xmath69 , we make the observation that the magnitude of spin hall effect is `` universal '' , @xmath70 : @xmath71 _ e.g. _ the spin hall voltage does not depend on the spin - orbit interaction constant @xmath12 . by `` universal '' ,",
    "we mean that the spin hall potential does not depend on the strength of the spin - orbit scattering potential .",
    "this implies that , as long as the scattering off magnetic impurities is weak , light metals ( _ e.g _ cu , al ) will give a similar spin hall voltage as heavy metals ( _ e.g _ pt ) .",
    "note that the spin hall potential depend on the fermi wave vector of the metal , @xmath13 , and thus weakly depends on the type of normal metal through this dependence .",
    "the reason for the `` universality '' is that although the spin - hall potential is proportional to the spin - orbit scattering it only builds up within the spin - diffusion length which is inversely proportional to the spin - orbit scattering strength .",
    "this section also illustrates the differences between the extrinsic spin - orbit scattering off impurities in normal metals , as treated here , and spin - orbit scattering induced by the rashba term and impurities in the two - dimensional electron gas formed in semiconductor heterostructures . in the two - dimensional electron gas ,",
    "there is currently a controversy whether the spin hall conductivity can reach a universal value in dirty systems , @xmath2 , independent of the spin - orbit scattering strength . in normal metals , we see from ( [ jacapprox ] ) that the spin hall conductivity is not universal , but the spin hall voltage ( [ iii-60 ] ) can be `` universal '' when scattering off magnetic impurities is weak",
    ".      we will now consider another transport regime , in which there is a finite spin - accumulation present in the normal metal even in the absence of spin - orbit scattering .",
    "the spin - accumulation can be achieved by sandwiching the normal metal between two ferromagnets when the system is driven out of equilibrium , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .     and @xmath72 to ferromagnet and normal metal.,width=264 ]    there are two extreme regimes depending on the ratio between the system length and the spin - diffusion length .",

    "there is no charge hall effect produced by the spin - orbit interaction in the middle of the system in this case .",
    "therefore , we consider the second , more interesting regime , when the normal metal is short , ( @xmath74 ) . in this case",
    "both spin and charge hall potentials can build up transverse to the current direction governed by the spin - orbit scattering .    in order to further simplify the computation of the diffusion equations ( [ ii-30 ] ) , ( [ ii-50 ] ) we assume that the normal metal is narrow , _",

    "the total current consists of four contributions : ordinary current , anomalous current , side - jump current and skew scattering current .",
    "these macroscopic diffusion equations , allows computation of charge hall voltages and spin hall voltages in pure normal metals or hybrid ferromagnet - normal metal systems .",
    "we have considered two experimental relevant geometries and calculated hall and spin - hall voltages in the case of weak spin - orbit interaction . in pure normal metals with no ferromagnetic contacts , there is no charge hall effect due to the spin - orbit interaction , and the spin hall effect is caused by the anomalous current , in agreement with the observation in ref . .",
    "in this geometry , we have made the additional observation that the spin hall voltage reaches and `` universal '' value independent of the strength of the spin - orbit interaction , when spin - flip scattering due to spin - orbit scattering dominates spin - flip scattering due to magnetic impurities . when a spin - polarized current is injected into a normal metal film , both a hall voltage and a spin hall voltage exist .",
    "the magnitude of the hall voltage is governed by side - jump , skew scattering and anomalous currents when the system is shorter than the spin - diffusion length . for systems longer than the spin - diffusion length , the hall voltage vanishes , and the spin hall effect resumes the value dominated by the anomalous current . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "the competition between skew scattering , side - jump scattering and anomalous velocity operator determines the spin hall and charge hall voltages .",
