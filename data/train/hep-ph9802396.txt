    "exclusive reactions of pion production are an important source of information on the nature of the strong interaction . they allow to study the dynamics of the processes as well as the pion - pion interaction . up to now a number of experiments which study production of pions by pions were fulfilled on unpolarized proton targets @xcite in the intermediate energy region .",
    "their results showed the predominant role of the one pion exchange ( ope ) and noticeable effects of absorption .",
    "the whole picture was satisfactorily described by models of the one pion exchange with absorption ( opea ) @xcite and regge - model with moving branchings @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the absence of information on the spin dependence of the reaction at the intermediate energies ( except the preliminary results of this experiment @xcite ) did not allow to go further in the understanding of the reaction mechanism , particularly it was not possible to estimate contribution of the axial - vector exchange .",
    "here we should mention two experiments with transversely polarized targets performed at high energies .",
    "authors of the first experiment @xcite used a polarized proton target to study the reaction @xmath6 at the incident pion beam momentum 17.2  gev / c . in the other @xcite the reaction @xmath7",
    "was explored at 5.98 and 11.85  gev / c on a polarized deutron target . in both experiments",
    "large asymmetries ( up to 50% ) in the @xmath0-meson production were observed .",
    "this was explained as a result of the essential contribution of the axial - vector exchange ( a@xmath8-meson ) , that caused doubts about the results of partial wave analyses , which neglected this mechanism .",
    "untrivial results of these experiments put forward the question of the energy dependence of the asymmetries .",
    "the latter would allow to estimate intercept of axial - vector regge trajectory .",
    "the angular distributions of the products of the reaction ( [ eq : pip ] ) at the transversely polarized target allow to fulfill a nearly full model independent amplitude analysis of the reaction @xcite .",
    "so in the region of the dipion masses below 1  gev where contribution of waves with @xmath9 is negligible , one can directly reconstruct modules of all the transversity amplitudes and most of the phases .",
    "besides all , this makes possible to separate the intensities of the dipions produced in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave states without additional assumptions and thus study the mass dependence of @xmath10-wave which is important for the scalar meson spectroscopy .    up to now the main source of information about light quark meson spectroscopy",
    "is the partial wave analyses of the pion - pion scattering .",
    "old analyses were based on the data obtained on unpolarized targets . in order to study",
    "the pion - pion interaction authors of these works separated the diagram of the one pion exchange and then made a transition from the scattering on the virtual pion to the scattering on the real one @xcite .",
    "the other method is to perform a partial wave analysis basing on the amplitudes of the reaction .",
    "but the model independent amplitude reconstruction is impossible without measurements on polarized targets . in the absence of such data",
    "the assumption was used that in the helicity system one could disregard amplitudes without the nucleon helicity flip @xcite .",
    "in addition the partial wave analyses used strong but not well proven assumptions of `` spin coherence '' , that is the absence of @xmath5 exchanges , and `` phase coherence '' , that is the equality of phases of @xmath11-waves with zero and unit helicities . on the other hand",
    "the analysis of the situation using roy s equations @xcite , incorporating conditions of unitarity , analyticity and crossing symmetry , showed that solutions of partial wave analysis are self content and generally correct @xcite , though individual analyses had noticeable difference in the @xmath10-wave phases .",
    "the results of partial wave analyses had an ambiguity in the behavior of the @xmath12 phase ( @xmath10-wave with zero isospin ) at dipion masses above 700  mev , so called `` up - down '' ambiguity .",
    "the `` up '' solution revealed more quick change of the @xmath12 phase under the peak of @xmath0-meson and was considered as resonance opposite to the `` down '' solution .",
    "the direct measurements of the mass dependence of the pion - pion interaction intensity with two @xmath13-mesons in the final state did not lead to a clear conclusion about the existence of the relatively narrow scalar resonance @xcite .",
    "the experiments at high energies with polarized targets @xcite showed large polarization effects that contradicted to the assumptions on which partial wave analyses were based .",
    "the model - independent amplitude analysis of the data from @xcite performed by m.  svec in @xcite gave 4-fold ambiguity in the solution , but all the variants corresponded to the resonant behaviour of the @xmath10-wave in the @xmath0-meson region .",
    "the important additional argument in favour of the existence of the resonance , obtained in this analysis , is the weak mass dependence of the relative phase between @xmath10-wave and @xmath11-wave with zero helicity .",
    "the simultaneous amplitude analysis of the reaction ( [ eq : pip ] ) together with the reaction @xmath14 @xcite gave two branches of the solution .",
    "one corresponded to a relatively narrow resonance ( @xmath15  mev and @xmath16  mev ) and the other  to a wide one ( @xmath17  mev and @xmath18  mev ) .",
    "the recent partial wave analysis of the data @xcite , which took into account the axial - vector exchange , gave also two branches of the solution for the phase @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "so the current amount of the experimental data over peripheral meson production is not sufficient to solve the `` up - down '' ambiguity , which preserves the open problem in the meson spectroscopy .",
    "nevertheless this data points out to the existence of the scalar - isoscalar resonance in the mass region below 1  gev ( wide sigma - meson @xmath19 and/or narrow @xmath20 ) .",
    "the history of the search of the scalar - isoscalar meson is long and contradictory .",
    "the @xmath21-meson was for the first time proposed in the work @xcite .",
    "up to 1974 this resonance was present in the pdg tables as @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 . in 1996",
    "it again appeared in pdg tables @xcite as @xmath19 .",
    "thus the modern state of the problem of light scalar - isoscalar meson requires additional experimental information and to provide such information was one of the goals of this work .",
    "we present here a new experimental data on the reaction ( [ eq : pip ] ) on the polarized proton and liquid hydrogen targets in the region of small momentum transfered at @xmath24  gev / c .",
    "the results are compared with the ones at high energies ( @xmath25  gev / c @xcite ) .",
    "the results are analyzed with the help of the regge phenomenology , which gives the natural connection between the high and intermediate energy regions .",
    "here we only want to review the basic formalism which could be found elsewhere in more details @xcite . at fixed beam momentum",
    "the reaction ( [ eq : pip ] ) is described by 5 kinematic variables .",
    "we use two energy variables ( the squared momentum transferred @xmath26 instead of @xmath26 ] and the dipion invariant mass @xmath28 ) and three angular variables .",
    "one angle @xmath29 describes the reaction plane and is defined as the angle between the normal to the reaction plane and the target polarization @xmath30 .",
    "the other two angles describe the dipion decay in its rest frame and are defined as angles @xmath31 ( gotfried - jackson angle ) and @xmath32 ( treiman - yang angle ) of the negative pion in the jackson coordinate system ( helicity system of the t - channel , axis @xmath33 along the beam and @xmath34 perpendicular to the reaction plane ) .",
    "the dynamics of the reaction ( [ eq : pip ] ) could be described by the set of the helicity amplitudes @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the spin and the helicity of the dimeson , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the neutron and proton helicities correspondingly . at @xmath40",
    "gev the dipion production with spins @xmath41 ( @xmath10-wave ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath11-wave ) is dominant .",
    "thus the reaction ( [ eq : pip ] ) in the energy region under consideration is described by 8 complex amplitudes : two for dipion production in @xmath10-state ( with and without neutron helicity flip ) and 6 for dipion production in @xmath11-state ( with dipion helicities + 1,0,-1 with or without neutron helicity flip ) .",
    "an experiment with a transversely polarized target yield 15 elements of spin density matrix ( sdme ) @xmath43 , defining the angular distributions of the reaction products .",
    "nine of them reflect the interference of the helicity flip and non - flip amplitudes and can be measured only in polarized target experiment .    the normalized process intensity as function of the sdme and the angular variables",
    "could be written as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 with two additional relations : @xmath46 the first of them expresses the normalization and the second defines @xmath47  conventional polarized target asymmetry .",
    "the data on transversely polarized target is best analyzed in terms of the nucleon transversity amplitudes with definite t - channel exchange naturality : @xmath10 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "these amplitudes are linear combinations of helicity amplitudes and correspond to definite recoil nucleon transversity ( `` down '' and `` up '' respectively ) .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath10 , @xmath51 and @xmath48 , @xmath52 describe production of the @xmath10-wave and @xmath11-wave dipions with zero helicity , respectively .",
    "amplitudes @xmath10 , @xmath51 , @xmath48 , @xmath52 , @xmath49 , @xmath53 are dominated by unnatural exchange , while amplitudes @xmath50 , @xmath54 - by natural one .",
    "@xmath55    these amplitudes are connected to sdme by the following equations : @xmath56    it is also useful to introduce partial - wave intensities @xmath57 and partial - wave polarizations",
    "@xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the absolute values of the transversity amplitudes could be reconstructed from the experiment on a polarized target .",
    "this is not so for the helicity amplitudes .",
    "the matrix elements measured allow to reconstruct the absolute values of all the amplitudes involved and all relative phases between them , except the relative phase between the two groups of amplitudes with different recoil nucleon transversity .",
    "the relations between the sdme and the amplitudes could be put in the form of two independent similar systems of equations @xcite , one for amplitudes",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath54 and the other for amplitudes with the opposite recoiled nucleon transversity .",
    "each of the systems could be reduced to a cubic equation in respect to @xmath61 or @xmath62 , correspondingly , which has two positive solutions .",
    "this provides two - fold ambiguity in the resulting amplitudes and four - fold ambiguity in the partial wave intensities .",
    "the apparatus used in this work is the further development of the experimental setup * spin * @xcite designed for the investigation of polarization effects in two- and three - particle reactions with two charged particles in the final state .",
    "it is a two - arm magnetic spectrometer with wire chambers and a transversely polarized proton target .",
    "spectrometric capabilities of the setup are provided by the magnet of the polarized target equipped with spark chambers placed in its field .",
