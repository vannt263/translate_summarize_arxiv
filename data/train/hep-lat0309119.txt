    "the observation of exotic states and the determination of their properties would elucidate aspects of qcd which are relatively unexplored .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath1 etc . can not be carried by a quark - antiquark pair in a ground - state @xmath2-wave .",
    "lattice qcd calculations exploring the non - trivial role of explicit gluon degrees of freedom in carrying the quantum numbers of the meson suggest that exotic meson states do indeed exist and have a mass the order of 2  gev @xcite .",
    "these findings are further supported here .",
    "exotic quantum numbers can be constructed by merging standard local interpolating fields @xmath3 with chromo - electric , @xmath4 , or chromo - magnetic fields , @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 quantum numbers of the interpolator are derived from the direct product of those associated with the quark bilinear and @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "for example , combining the vector current of the @xmath9 meson with a chromo - magnetic field , @xmath10 provides @xmath11 with the @xmath12 : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 meson ) and the @xmath0 : @xmath15 ( * exotic * ) .",
