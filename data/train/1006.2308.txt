    "we consider a class of kinematic dynamos in which the magnetic field @xmath3 is generated by the steady helical motion @xmath4 of an incompressible , electrically - conducting fluid .",
    "helical flows constitute some of the simplest and most efficient mechanisms for the excitation of a seed magnetic field , as witnessed in numerical simulation and exploited by laboratory experiments ( gailitis et al .",
    "1987 , dudley & james 1989 , forest et al .",
    "2002 , moss 2008 , for example ) .",
    "such flows are also widespread in astrophysical fluid bodies , such as jets , the convection zones of stars and , possibly , liquid planetary cores , where they might appear as a slow meridional circulation ( giles et al .",
    "1997 , gough and mcintyre 1998 , olson et al .  1999 ,",
    "haber et al .",
    "2002 , hartigan et al .",
    "2005 ) .    by far the simplest helical flow is the ponomarenko dynamo ( ponamerenko 1973 ) , which consists of a solid electrically - conducting cylinder of finite radius rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath5 and translating with a constant axial velocity @xmath6 , while its rigid ( electrically - conducting ) exterior remains at rest .",
    "the dynamo loop in this case comprises ( a ) generation of azimuthal magnetic field from radial magnetic field by the discontinuity in the rotation ( the ` omega effect ' ) , and ( b ) reciprocal generation of radial field from azimuthal field by magnetic diffusion . note that the additional longitudinal shearing component @xmath6 is crucial ,",
    "as it draws apart oppositely directed field lines and prevents flux expulsion .",
    "ponomarenko ( 1973 ) determined the magnetic field in this case analytically , showing that the field is concentrated at the velocity discontinuity on the cylinder boundary .",
    "helical dynamos with non - uniform @xmath6 and @xmath5 and arbitrary cross - section , such as in a conducting fluid , are naturally more complicated ( but see the exact steady solutions of lortz 1968 , and chen & milovich 1984 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they share the same dynamo ingredients : differential rotation and magnetic diffusion .",
    "these ingredients are especially conspicuous at very large magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 , a regime which can be probed successfully with asymptotic theory ( ruzmaikin et al .  1988 , gilbert 1988 , gilbert & ponty 2000 , hereafter gp ) . in such models",
    "the importance of diffusion , in particular , is evident from the localisation of potentially growing dynamo modes upon their critical surfaces , where the modes are nearly convected by the flow .",
    "it is upon these surfaces that the modes exhibit the small - scale variation necessary for magnetic diffusion to work effectively and replenish radial magnetic field .",
    "not every stream - surface can support a mode , but a ` resonance condition ' selects the critical surface ( or surfaces ) upon which dynamo action can occur .",
    "the asymptotics of helical dynamos in an infinite cylinder have been generalised to helical dynamos in a sphere ( gp ) .",
    "a spherical single - roll dynamo can be portrayed as a cylindrical helical flow with its two ends joined , bent into a donut , and deformed to fill a spherical ` container ' .",
    "the theory predicts that at large @xmath0 the dominant mechanism of field generation is of ponamarenko type and , indeed , that the same asymptotic scalings hold .",
    "however , full numerical studies of the dynamo problem in spheres have mostly tested small or intermediate @xmath0 , primarily to establish the critical @xmath0 necessary for dynamo action ( dudley & james 1989 , forest et al .",
    "2002 , moss 2008 ) .",
    "the very large @xmath0 regime has not received the same attention , partly because it remains a challenging numerical task .",
    "consequently , the gp asymptotic theory has not yet been numerically confirmed .",
    "this is the main project of our paper    we undertake an analysis of single - roll helical dynamos in a sphere , surrounded by an insulator , at very large magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "this is accomplished numerically by the solution of the magnetic induction equation with suitable boundary conditions for two representative single - roll flows .",
    "the method of solution is presented in ivers and phillips ( 2003 , 2008 ) and consists of approximating the problem as a large - scale algebraic eigenvalue equation .",
    "the growth rates and eigenfunctions so obtained are subsequently compared with the predictions of the gp asymptotic theory .",
    "we find excellent agreement in the regime @xmath7 for the growth rates and angular frequency , and good agreement for the magnetic field structure when @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , the magnetic field structure clearly localises upon a specific stream - surface , in contrast to intermediate @xmath0 where the field is somewhat disordered .",
    "this confirms that spherical single - roll dynamos are indeed of the ponamerenko type : no other growing modes were discovered .",
    "this is a point that can deepen our understanding of spherical dynamos more generally and aid the analysis of more complex spherical flows . in particular",
    ", it is an entry point into the study of multiple rolls , whose magnetic field generation will also be influenced by the gailitis dynamo mechanism ( gailitis 1970 , 1993 , 1995 , moss 2006 ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the formal dynamo problem is stated  its governing equations , parameters , and boundary conditions  and the two flows we examine are presented . a brief summary of the gp asymptotic results at large @xmath0 follows in section 3 , while their derivation is given in appendix a , in the supplemental material , alongside a method to obtain higher order terms .",
    "our results and a comparison of the two approaches are given in section 4 , and conclusions drawn in section 5 .",
    "consider a sphere of conducting fluid @xmath6 with radius @xmath9 and uniform magnetic diffusivity @xmath10 surrounded by an insulator @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that the fluid is undergoing time - steady incompressible motions according to the velocity @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the magnetic field in the conducting fluid is governed by the non - dimensionalised induction equation , @xmath12 where the magnetic reynolds number @xmath13 is defined in terms of a typical velocity @xmath14 , the radius @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the time @xmath15 is scaled on the magnetic diffusion time @xmath16 and space by @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath3 is solenoidal everywhere , @xmath17 because the flow is steady , the magnetic field can be expressed as a linear superposition of time - separable solutions of the form @xmath18 possibly with polynomial factors of time in degenerate cases .",
    "in addition , we must supply suitable boundary conditions @xmath19_\\sigma = { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{0}}}\\,,\\qquad    { \\ensuremath{\\nabla\\times}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{b}}}= { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{0}}}\\quad \\text{in $ v^c$,}\\qquad    { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{b}}}\\to { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{0}}}\\quad \\text{as $ r\\to\\infty$,}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the surface of the sphere .",
    "this leads to an eigenvalue problem for the ( complex ) growth rate @xmath21 and the associated eigenfunction . for a given flow @xmath4 ,",
    "the growth rate @xmath21 is a function of the magnetic reynolds number @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath22 , the flow acts as a kinematic dynamo , i.e. the non - magnetic state @xmath23 is unstable to magnetic perturbations .",
    "we use spherical coordinates whereby the radius , polar angle , and azimuthal angle are denoted by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , with their accompanying unit vectors given by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "an axisymmetric single - roll helical flows may be represented by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ( scaled ) meridional velocity , @xmath32 is the azimuthal _ angular _ speed , and @xmath33 is a parameter measuring the relative strengths of the meridional and azimuthal motion .",
    "the meridional flow @xmath31 can be written in terms of a stream function @xmath34 by @xmath35 the streamlines of @xmath31 in a meridional plane are the level contours of @xmath34 and circle a local minimum ( maximum ) of @xmath34 in the clockwise ( counter - clockwise ) direction .",
    "we also introduce the ` unscaled ' meridional velocity @xmath36 and stream function @xmath37 , which are more convenient when describing the asymptotic theory .    in this paper",
    ", we examine two representative single - roll flows , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the two flows share the same meridional velocity @xmath31 but differ in the azimuthal component @xmath40 .",
    "we set the stream function @xmath34 according to @xmath41 but set @xmath42 flow 1 therefore possesses the restricted form @xmath43 , while flow 2 has a more general form .",
    "the restricted form of the local angular velocity simplifies the asymptotic theory substantially .    in figs 1 and 2",
    "the two flows are represented .",
    "figure 1 shows the isocontours of @xmath34 , the meridional stream function common to both flows .",
    "as the figure indicates , fluid circulates in a clockwise direction around a central stagnation point located at @xmath44 . in the case of flow 1 , for which @xmath45 , the isocontours of the azimuthal rotation coincide with the isocontours of the meridional rotation .",
    "therefore a fluid element upon a given streamsurface will not only circulate at a constant speed in the meridional plane it will also travel at a constant angular speed in the azimuthal direction .",
    "it is then easier to find flow trajectories that form closed loops .",
    "this is not the case for the more complicated flow 2 , whose azimuthal angular speed exhibits a purely radial profile .",
    "thus surfaces of constant rotation are spherical shells .",
    "this means a fluid element in flow 2 will experience different azimuthal angular velocities as it traverses a meridional streamline .",
    "the actual azimuthal velocities , @xmath46 , of both flows are plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "the full numerical method we employ requires that the velocities are split into toroidal and poloidal components and expanded in spherical harmonics : @xmath47 where the toroidal components are given by @xmath48 and the poloidal components by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a spherical harmonic ( see ivers & phillips 2003 , 2008 ) .",
    "flow 1 has the poloidal - toroidal spectral decomposition @xmath51 , in which the radial functions are @xmath52 and the spherical harmonics are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the second flow @xmath39 is the single - roll flow of dudley & james ( 1989 ) .",
    "this flow has the poloidal - toroidal spectral form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 although @xmath38 has the simpler restricted form of the local angular velocity , its spherical harmonic representation is actually more complicated than @xmath39 .",
    "this section summarises the main features and results of the gp asymptotic theory , undertaken at large @xmath0 . here",
    "we give , without proof , the leading order terms for the growth rates at @xmath57 and the leading order contribution to the magnetic eigenfunction .",
    "the derivations of these expressions are placed in the appendix a of the supplemental material for reference . there",
    "we also present a method whereby higher order terms in the asymptotic expansion can be calculated .",
    "the structure of the helical flow , i.e.  the topology of its streamlines and its differential rotation , can be exploited by a toroidal coordinate system which simplifies the advection operator .",
    "the first two coordinates are determined by the meridional flow .",
    "the stream function @xmath58 is one coordinate ( note that we use the unscaled stream function ) .",
    "the second is an angle coordinate @xmath59 defined as follows .",
    "if @xmath60 is the period for a fluid particle to traverse once the closed streamline @xmath61 , then @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the angular frequency , @xmath65 is the element of arc - length travelled in a time @xmath66 and @xmath67 . thus @xmath68 is constant on streamlines . for the two flows we consider we fix @xmath69 on the @xmath70-axis @xmath71 , since the stagnation points of their meridional parts occur there .",
    "clearly @xmath59 changes by @xmath72 in one full traversal of the closed streamline .",
    "we denote by an overbar , or pair of angle brackets , the average around the streamline @xmath61 , defined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a function of the meridional coordinates @xmath58 and @xmath59 and the integration is around the streamline @xmath61 .",
    "we can thus take any quantity @xmath75 and compute a mean component independent of @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath76 , and a ` fluctuating ' component , @xmath77 .",
    "having specified these details , we replace the azimuthal angle @xmath26 by a third coordinate @xmath78 defined by @xmath79 the level surfaces of @xmath78 are hence distorted azimuthal planes    the coordinate system @xmath80 naturally gives rise to the two right - handed vector bases , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the position vector .",
    "it is a useful shorthand to also denote the coordinates by @xmath87 with indices @xmath88 , and the two bases by @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the bases are reciprocal , @xmath91 , and related by @xmath92 where the jacobian @xmath93 of the transformation to @xmath80 is given by @xmath94 using the properties of the flux function , equations may be simplified to @xmath95 finally , using the properties of reciprocal bases the velocity and the magnetic field may be written as @xmath96 the advection operator is expressed as @xmath97 its sole dependence on @xmath58 is essential in the asymptotic theory .",
    "the magnetic induction equation scaled on the turn - over timescale @xmath98 is @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the contravariant components of with respect to the new coordinates are @xmath101 the primes indicate derivatives with respect @xmath58 . as noted above , regeneration of the magnetic field component @xmath102",
    "is solely due to diffusion , but regeneration of @xmath103 and @xmath104 is partly due to distortion of @xmath102 by meridional and azimuthal differential rotation , respectively .",
    "the gp theory is developed in the large @xmath0 regime , i.e.  as @xmath105 .",
    "the leading order solution is decomposed into dynamo modes of the form @xmath106 .",
    "thus @xmath107 . the constants @xmath108 and",
    "@xmath109 must be integers for solutions single - valued in @xmath78 and @xmath59 .",
    "the following scalings are subsequently adopted ( ruzmaikin et al .  1988 ) @xmath110 moreover , it is assumed that modes localise upon a stream surface @xmath61 in a layer of thickness @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath59- and @xmath78-derivatives are @xmath112 , but @xmath58-derivatives are @xmath113 .",
    "this suggests a new variable @xmath114 defined through @xmath115 so that @xmath114-derivatives are @xmath116 .",
    "the magnetic solution and growth rates are subsequently expanded in powers of @xmath117 , and a particular streamline @xmath118 is chosen and equilibrium quantities depending on @xmath58 expanded in taylor series about this streamline .",
    "these are substituted into the governing equations and we collect terms order by order solving each set of equations as we go .",
    "these details are summarised in appendix a of the supplemental material . in brief ,",
    "solvability of the zeroth order equations forces a given dynamo mode to localise on its critical stream surface , where it will be convected with the flow .",
    "solvability of the first order equations , yields a ` resonance condition ' which selects which stream surface ( or surfaces ) can actually harbour such dynamo modes .",
    "solvability of the second order equations provides the leading order @xmath114-structure of the modes and the leading order growth rate .      in the following expressions we transform from @xmath58 to @xmath34 and thus make explicit the dependence on the tuning parameter @xmath33 .      to dominant order spatially ,",
    "dynamo modes take the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the parabolic cylinder function of order @xmath121 ( abramowitz & stegun 1972 ) , with @xmath122 and @xmath123{|\\pi''_o|/\\overline{\\gamma}_0}\\bigg ( \\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2 } } + i\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}}\\ \\operatorname{sgn}\\pi''_o\\bigg)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and a prime now indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "the parabolic cylinder functions impart a gaussian - like structure about the resonant curve , with spatial oscillations of rapidly diminishing amplitude as distance @xmath114 from the curve increases .",
    "higher @xmath121 modes display more complex spatially varying behaviour within the envelope of the stream surface localization .",

    "the @xmath129 mode is the fastest growing magnetic field mode to dominant order for any @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the geometric @xmath130 terms are @xmath131    in addition gp add terms of higher order @xmath132 to the expression for @xmath133 arguing that these are the most important at this order .",
    "the additional terms are @xmath134 the @xmath135 s , which are independent of @xmath33 , are given by @xmath136      the expression for the mode frequency eq .",
    ", shows that dynamo modes are ( to leading order ) ` advected ' by the flow at the streamline upon which they localise .",
    "that is to say , @xmath137 .",
    "it follows that the resonant streamsurface is a magnetic critical layer , and modes in its immeditae vicinity will naturally exhibit rapid spatial oscillations , though these are regularised by the ( small ) magnetic diffusion upon the critical streamsurface itself . at large @xmath0",
    "these oscillations are crucial to dynamo action , because they provide sufficiently steep spatial gradients for the small resistivity to work efficiently , and regenerate @xmath102 .",
    "they hence close the dynamo loop begun by the differential rotation across the layer .",
    "we have not yet stated which streamline a given dynamo mode will prefer , upon which the resonance condition holds .",
    "this condition may be written as @xmath138 in general , we find that @xmath139 , which indicates that the resonant streamline corresponds to the maximal helical gradient of the magnetic mode .",
    "but equation ( a ) is also the condition for the closure of the magnetic field lines on the surface @xmath61 to leading order , as the following argument shows .",
    "since @xmath140 , the equation for the magnetic field lines , @xmath141 , reduces to @xmath142 for the magnetic field eqs - , the field lines to leading order are @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a given point on the field line .",
    "the magnetic field line is closed if there are integers @xmath109 , @xmath108 such that @xmath145 and @xmath146 , which give the resonance condition ( a ) .",
    "so , unsurprisingly , a resonant surface also corresponds to the spatial localisation for which a magnetic mode reinforces itself .",
    "the resonance condition also ensures the @xmath147-magnetic field is solenoidal .      in practice",
    ", it is simplest to stipulate the ratio @xmath148 and the streamline @xmath34 and then compute the @xmath33 necessary for this @xmath34 to be resonant from .",
    "therefore , @xmath149 and @xmath33 may be interpreted as an adjustable ` tuning ' parameter , permitting modes on any streamline we choose .",
    "however , it is also instructive to examine how the dynamo modes , and their resonant streamlines change , as @xmath33 varies .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 controls the geometry of the helical flow by establishing the ratio of the meridional circulation s speed against the azimuthal rotation , and hence directly influences the dynamo action .",
    "consider flow 2 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "each choice of @xmath33 and @xmath150 will give a single resonant curve @xmath151 .",
    "now fix the pitch @xmath150 of the dynamo modes under consideration ; this means that as we vary @xmath33 we also vary the resonant streamsurface . on the other hand , for flow 2",
    ", it can be shown that , as @xmath34 varies between 0 and its minimum value , the quantity @xmath152 varies monotonically between two nearby constants , the smaller associated with the outermost streamline upon the spherical boundary , and the larger with the stagnation point . from",
    ", it then follows that there exists only a ( narrow ) interval of @xmath33 for which a resonance on any streamline is possible .",
    "each choice of @xmath150 furnishes a different interval of @xmath33 but none of these overlap .",
    "a subinterval of each may permit magnetic growth .",
    "therefore as we vary @xmath33 , and consequently modify the flow geometry , we encounter discrete ` windows ' , or ` resonance intervals ' , of magnetic field generation . note that dynamo action is not possible in every interval , in particular for very small and very large @xmath33 .",
    "these require large @xmath108 or @xmath109 which violates the scaling assumptions of the asymptotic theory , eq .  [ 2.18 ] . in any case , proctor",
    "s modification of the toroidal anti - dynamo theorem ( proctor 2004 ) suggests that there can be no magnetic growth for @xmath153 , i.e.  for flows almost entirely azimuthal . in the other limit , @xmath33 large , which corresponds to a flow dominated by the meridional component , things are less clear . for certain stream functions dynamo action appears possible in the complete absence of the azimuthal motion ( @xmath154 ) , though",
    "the relationship between the flow and the boundary is crucial ( moss 2008 ) .",
    "in contrast , the simpler flow 1 admits dynamo action for a very wide range of @xmath33 ; moreover , multiple @xmath150 modes may grow concurrently . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath33 resonance intervals overlap substantially .",
    "plainly , a simpler flow , in which both the azimuthal and meridional motion are closely related , is the more propitious for magnetic generation .",
    "this follows from the fact that the fluid trajectories can more easily join the magnetic field lines they convect into closed loops . in circumstances where the profiles of @xmath34 and @xmath32 are dissimilar ( flow 2 ) , this is more difficult to do , and",
    "can only occur when their relative magnitudes are tuned appropriately ( by @xmath33 ) .    considering how vital it is to for the flow to close magnetic field lines in the large @xmath0 limit , it is natural to enquire into the ( possibly deleterious ) influence of small velocity fluctuations superimposed upon the mean helical motion .",
    "recent work on the cylindrical ponomarenko dynamo shows that magnetic growth persists when the amplitudes of the helical flow has a small time - dependent ( fluctuating ) part .",
    "dynamo action even can occur when the meridional and azimuthal fluctuations are slightly different functions of time , forcing the resonant curve to also change with time ( peyrot et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "similar behaviour undoubtedly carries over to the spherical single roll dynamos we consider .",
    "however , when the small velocity fluctuation is not only a function of time , but of space as well , dynamo action will most likely suffer .",
    "in such a flow the fluid trajectories will not normally close .",
    "thus , like flow 2 , the magnetic field lines they transport will not normally close , and the resonance condition will be more difficult to satisfy . dynamo activity may still be possible in the limit of small fluctuation amplitude , as then the fluid trajectories may not deviate beyond the magnetic localisation , but this probably can only be checked with numerical simulations .",
    "we present results for each of the flows @xmath38 and @xmath39 , corresponding to a representative configuration of the parameters for the same resonant stream surface . for both @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "this resonant curve is @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "the resonance is ensured for given @xmath108 and @xmath109 by setting the tuning parameter @xmath33 according to .",
    "the resonance conditions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 may be expressed as @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath159 to 4 significant figures .",
    "moreover , for the flows we examine there is no degeneracy in @xmath33 , i.e. for a given @xmath33 there is only one possible set of @xmath160 , and hence only one resonant curve for a given flow .    the different times",
    "@xmath161 , @xmath15 of the asymptotic and numerical results are related by @xmath162 .",
    "thus to compare the asymptotic and numerical results , the numerical growth rates are divided by @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "moreover , asymptotic and numerical modes must be correctly matched .",
    "there is no difficulty with the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath108 , since it coincides in the asymptotic and numerical results for @xmath38 , and also for @xmath39 , when @xmath78 is decomposed and the factor @xmath165 is extracted from the eigenfunction .",
    "we assumed that , once the resonant curve and the wavenumbers @xmath108 , @xmath109 are chosen , which sets the tuning parameter @xmath166 , the collection of modes determined by the numerical eigenproblem correspond to the various asymptotic @xmath121 modes .",
    "the strongest growing exact ( numerical ) mode was identified with @xmath129 .",
    "the calculation of the asymptotic solution for a given flow and its rendering in spherical coordinates is not straightforward .",
    "this called for various analytical tricks and numerical techniques , a full explanation of which we give in appendix b in the supplemental material .",
    "most of the effort lay in computing the @xmath130 and @xmath135 coefficients and also in determining the @xmath34 derivatives of @xmath5 and @xmath167 at @xmath128 .",
    "these quantities , in fact , can all be expressed as contour integrals of various kinds over all or part of the streamline @xmath151 . when these integrals are closed they can be numerically approximated with excellent accuracy .",
    "the chief numerical parameter here is the number of @xmath168 points used to discretise the resonant streamline @xmath169 ; this was denoted by @xmath170 ( see appendix b in the supplemental material ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the full dynamo problem presents a considerable numerical challenge , especially in the large @xmath0 regime when the magnetic structure exhibits small - scale localised variation . in this limit extreme resolution",
    "is required to properly capture the dynamo modes , which leads to the eigensolution of enormous , albeit banded , matrices .",
    "a full explanation of the techniques employed to approximate the magnetic induction operator with such matrices can be found in ivers & phillips ( 2003 , 2008 ) .",
    "we summarise the approach below .",
    "our numerical method uses a hybrid version of the spectral equations of james ( 1974 ) , which are in a similar form to the poloidal - toroidal spectral equations derived by bullard & gellman ( 1954 ) .",
    "the magnetic field and velocity field are expanded in vector spherical harmonics when they appear in the advection term , but otherwise are decomposed into toroidal - poloidal components and then expanded in scalar spherical harmonics .",
    "doing so requires us to compute fewer coupling integrals .",
    "the spectral expansion is truncated at some large order @xmath171 , so that for a given azimuthal mode number @xmath108 there are @xmath172 spherical harmonic functions .",
    "the radial dependence is discretised using fourth - order finite - differences over a uniform grid .",
    "the number of radial points is denoted by @xmath173 . a centred - finite difference formula were used at interior points and one - sided formulas at the boundaries .",
    "truncation in the number of harmonics and in radius converts the problem into a set of linear equations for @xmath174 coefficients plus the growth rate @xmath21 .",
    "we solve this algebraic eigenvalue problem by inverse iteration and the implictly restarted arnoldi method using arpack ( sorensen 1992 ) .",
    "the arnoldi method is particularly helpful in identifying the mode of fastest growth at large @xmath0 because the eigenvalues in this limit bunch together in the complex plane : the ratio of the real part of the growth rate to the imaginary part is @xmath57 as indicated by the asymptotic theory ( see also table 2 ) .",
    "consequently , inverse iteration has difficulty in converging to the eigenvalue of largest real part without a good estimate of the true eigenvalue .",
    ".convergence of the dominant mode s eigenvalue @xmath21 with the numerical parameters @xmath93 and @xmath171 .",
    "the number of radial grid points is @xmath173 , the number of spherical harmonic functions is @xmath172 .",
    "the growth rates are for @xmath39 at @xmath175 and @xmath176 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the asymptotic estimates were computed in matlab .",
    "the convergence of quantities required by the asymptotic theory is shown in table  3 for different numbers @xmath170 of numerical integration nodes along the chosen streamline , @xmath151 . those quantities that issue from a single integration around the closed streamline",
    "converge very rapidly , typically for @xmath177 .",
    "these include @xmath178 and its @xmath34 derivatives , @xmath167 and its @xmath34 derivatives , and @xmath179 .",
    "thus the quantities @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 are accurate to the figures shown here for @xmath186 .",
    "however , quantities which are evaluated by line integrals with variable limits converge more slowly , and settle down only for @xmath187 ."
