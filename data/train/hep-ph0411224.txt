    "recent observation of an exotic baryon state with positive strangeness , @xmath10 , by leps collaboration in spring-8 @xcite and subsequent experiments @xcite has raised great interests in hadron physics .",
    "this state can not be an ordinary three - quark baryon since having positive strangeness , and the minimal quark content is @xmath11 .",
    "a remarkable feature of @xmath10 is that the width is unusually small ( @xmath12 ) despite the fact that it lies about @xmath13 mev above the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "the absense of isospin partners suggests that the @xmath14 is an isosinglet @xcite .",
    "the spin and parity have not yet been experimentally determined .",
    "the discovery of @xmath15 has triggered intense theoretical studies to understand the structure of the @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "one of the main issues is to clarify the quantum numbers , especially , the spin and the parity , which are key properties for understanding the abnormally small width .    following a naive expectation from ordinary hadron spectra ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the @xmath15 has the lowest spin @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , most of the existing works on @xmath15 in lattice qcd @xcite or in qcd sum rule @xcite have focussed only on the @xmath16 states .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that @xmath15 is a higher spin state , as suggested in some literatures @xcite .",
    "for example , negative parity @xmath17 states are especially important because they can be extremely narrow in the following reasons : first , consider an @xmath18 state ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the total isospin and parity , respectively ) .",
    "if this state lies much below the @xmath21 threshold , no @xmath5-wave decay channel opens and the decay is restricted only to @xmath7-wave @xmath6 states . due to the high centrifugal barrier the width is strongly suppressed .",
    "thus , this state can be a candidate for the observed @xmath15 . for just the same reason , @xmath4",
    "can also be seen as a narrow peak .",
    "if the state is sufficiently below the @xmath22 threshold , the allowed decay channel is only @xmath6 in @xmath7-wave and the width can be significantly small @xcite .",
    "another state in which we have an interest is the pentaquark with @xmath23 , which has been discussed as a spin - orbit ( @xmath24 ) partner of the @xmath25 state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 state was assigned to the observed @xmath14 by jaffe and wilczek @xcite . according to their conjecture ,",
    "the @xmath14 consists of two spinless @xmath26-diquarks in @xmath20-wave and an anti - strange quark . as a result , the @xmath24-partners , @xmath25 and @xmath27 , appear due to the coupling between the relative motion with orbital angular momentum @xmath28 and the intrinsic spin of the anti - strange quark .",
    "the effect of the @xmath24 force is so weak in the diquark structure that the mass splitting should be small .",
    "it leads to a possibility of the low - lying @xmath29 as pointed out in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath30 and @xmath1 pentaquark states by using the method of qcd sum rule @xcite . in order to ascertain the existence of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 narrow pentaquarks ,",
    "it is crucial to estimate their absolute masses since their widths are sensitive to the energy difference from the @xmath21 or @xmath22 threshold .",
    "qcd sum rule is closely related to the fundamental theory and is able to evaluate the absolute masses of hadrons without any model assumptions . in qcd sum rule approach",
    ", a correlation function of an interpolating field is calculated by the use of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , and is compared with the spectral representation via dispersion relation .",
    "the sum rules relate hadron properties to the vacuum expectation values of qcd composite operators ( condensates ) such as @xmath31 , @xmath32 and so on . from the relation ,",
    "one can understand hadron properties in terms of the structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we formulate the general method for deriving the qcd sum rules for positive and negative parity baryons with @xmath33 .",
    "then , in the third section , we apply the method to constructing the sum rules for the pentaquark with @xmath0 and that with @xmath1 . from the obtained sum rules",
    ", we show the numerical results , discuss whether those states of pentaquark can exist , and evaluate their masses in the fourth section . in the fifth section",
    ", we discuss whether they can be narrow states and the relation with the investigation by other approaches , and finally summarize the paper .",
    "in this section , we formulate the qcd sum rule for positive and negative parity states of @xmath33 baryons .    the correlation function from which we derive the qcd sum rule",
    "is _ ( p)&=&-id^4 x(ipx ) 0|t|0 , [ corfun ] where @xmath34 is an interpolating field that couples to baryon states with @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is constructed with quark ( and gluon ) fields so as to have the quantum numbers of the baryon which we want to know about .",
    "the correlation function , , has various tensor structures , _ ( p)&=&&&+ .",
    "we consider the terms proportional to @xmath35 : ( p)&&_1(p^2)+_6(p^2 ) , [ 3/2part ] since only the @xmath33 states contribute to these terms .",
    "other terms include the contribution from not only @xmath33 states but also @xmath36 states @xcite .",
    "we can relate the correlation function with the spectral function via lehman representation , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the spectral function . on the other hand , in the deep euclid region , @xmath39",
    ", the correlation function can be evaluated by an ope .",
    "then the correlation function is expressed as a sum of various vacuum condensates . using the analyticity",
    ", we obtain a relation between the imaginary part of the correlation function evaluated by an ope , @xmath40 , and the spectral function as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an analytic function of @xmath43 .",
    "is a general form of the qcd sum rule . by properly parameterizing @xmath44",
    ", we obtain qcd sum rules for physical quantities in @xmath44 .",
    "let us first look at the spectral function , @xmath44 .",
    "we consider the interpolating field with negative parity .",
    "the interpolating field couples to positive parity states as well as negative parity states @xcite .",
    "accordingly , both of the parity states contribute to @xmath45 as physical intermediate states .",

    ", the widths of the physical states were neglected .",
    "the spectral function in the rest frame , @xmath50 , can be decomposed into two parts , @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are expressed as _",
    "-(p_0)&=&_n , [ spe- ] + _ + ( p_0)&=&_n . [ spe+ ] here , for later use , we note that the spectral function for the interpolating field with positive parity is given by interchanging @xmath54 and @xmath55 in , @xmath56    next , we construct the sum rule for negative parity states and that for positive parity .",
    "we apply the projection operator @xmath57 to for @xmath50 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath58 note that in the contributions from the positive and negative parity states are mixed since , as can be seen from , each of @xmath54 and @xmath55 contains the contributions from both of the parity states .",
    "what we want to do is to separate the negative and the positive parity contributions from eqs.([projectqsr ] ) .",
    "the following procedure of the parity projection is essentially equivalent to that in ref.@xcite .",
    "if the expressions of the spectral functions calculated by an ope , @xmath59 , are separable into @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we can independently construct the sum rule from the @xmath62 part of the correlation function and that from the @xmath63 part @xcite .",
    "the sum rules obtained from the @xmath62 part are @xmath64 is the sum rule for the negative parity state since only the negative parity states contribute to @xmath54 for @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "is the sum rule for the positive parity state since @xmath55 for @xmath62 contains only the positive parity states ( see ) .",
    "a comment is in order here . in order to separate the positive and negative parity states in the sum rule as ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath59 are separable into @xmath60 and @xmath61 as mentioned above . in general",

    "a simple quark model in which constituent quarks interact via one - gluon exchange force at short distances and confining ( or string ) potential at long distances was considered .",
    "a @xmath185 system has a connected string configuration corresponding to a confined state , in addition to an ordinary meson - baryon like configuration . a variational method called amd ( antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ) @xcite",
    "was applied to the confined five - body system with @xmath186 and all the possible spin parity states with the connected string configurations were calculated .",
    "the narrow and low lying states they have found are @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath4 states .",
    "the former two states have just the same structure as that conjectured by jaffe and wilczek @xcite . we represent it as @xmath187_{s=0,i=0}[ud]_{s=0,i=0}[\\bar{s}]$ ] , where @xmath187_{s , i}$ ] denotes a color @xmath188 @xmath26-diquark with spin @xmath5 and isospin @xmath19 . both of the two diquarks gain color magnetic interaction since they have @xmath189 .",
    "however , the @xmath25 and @xmath27 states lose kinetic and string energy since the two diquarks , which are to be antisymmetric in color , are identical and since they must be relatively @xmath20-wave . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "another energetically favorable state has been predicted , which consists of an @xmath189 diquark and an @xmath190 diquark : @xmath187_{s=0,i=0}[ud]_{s=1,i=1}[\\bar{s}]$ ] .",
    "the quantum number of this state is totally @xmath4 .",
    "it loses color magnetic interaction due to the existence of a diquark with @xmath190 .",
    "however , the @xmath4 state gains kinetic and string energy since the two diquarks are no longer identical and since they can be relatively @xmath5-wave .",
    "owing to the balance between the energy gain and the loss , the @xmath4 state degenerate with the @xmath25 and @xmath27 states .",
    "a problem common to the above two works is that within the quark models one can not predict the absolute masses but only the level structure of the pentaquarks in principle .",
    "the quark models employed in refs.@xcite relies on the zero - point energy of the confining potential .",
    "the value of the zero - point energy , however , is not determined within this kind of emprical models . in ref.@xcite , it was adjusted to reproduce the observed mass of @xmath14 . whereas , the qcd sum rule is able to estimate the absolute mass though it depends on the effective continuum threshold .",
    "we confirmed from the qcd sum rule that the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 states are below the @xmath5-wave threshold and therefore they can be narrow states .    the pentaquark with @xmath4 has also been found to exist as a resonant state in the @xmath22 channel @xcite from the chiral unitary approach .",
    "this state is generated due to an attractive interaction in that channel existing in the lowest order chiral lagrangian .",
    "the attractive interaction leads to a pole of the complex energy plane and manifests itself in a large strength of the @xmath22 scattering amplitude with @xmath191 and @xmath98 .",
    "we note that the interpolating field , , can also couple with such a @xmath22 resonance states because it contains the @xmath22 component as is shown by fierz transformation .",
    "the @xmath27 state has been discussed as a @xmath24 partner of the @xmath25 state @xcite . in the qcd sum rule study of the @xmath25 state @xcite , it was found in the energy region compatible with the experimentally measured @xmath14 mass . in ref.@xcite , the interpolating field based on jaffe and wilczek s conjecture : @xmath187_{s=0,i=0}[ud]_{s=0,i=0}[\\bar{s}]$ ] for the @xmath25 state",
    "was employed .",
    "if such a diquark structure is realized , the mass splitting between the @xmath25 and the @xmath27 is expected to be small because the effect of the spin - orbit force should be small due to the existence of two spinless diquarks . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors predicted that the @xmath27 state may exist in the mass region 1.54gev @xmath193 gev based on the diquark picture . in the present calculation , since the interporating field for the @xmath77 can couple with such the diquark configuration , the obtained result for the @xmath27 state may be associated with the @xmath24 partner of the @xmath25 state with jaffe and wilczek s diquark structure .",
    "our result implies a possiblity of the @xmath27 state .",
    "however , as was shown in the previous section , the sum rule for @xmath27 channel is less reliable",
    ". therefore we should not discuss the mass difference with the @xmath25 state using the results from the present sum rule . to do that",
    ", it would be necessary to construct the sum rule in which the background continuum contribution is made as small as possible .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath194 pentaquarks are expected to be broader than the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath194 states can decay into @xmath20-wave @xmath6 states , while the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states decay only to @xmath7-wave @xmath6 states .",
    "the centrifugal barrier of @xmath20-wave @xmath6 states is lower than that of @xmath7-wave @xmath6 states , which makes the positive parity states broader than the negative parity states .",
    "the present result for the @xmath194 state is consistent with a recent calculation by skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite predicted that there exists a new isotriplet of @xmath195-baryons with @xmath194 .",
    "its mass is @xmath196 and the width is large : @xmath197 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the high spin ( @xmath33 ) states of pentaquark with @xmath77 and @xmath98 using the method of qcd sum rule .",
    "we have derived the qcd sum rules for both of the negative and positive parity states .",
    "the qcd sum rule suggests the existence of pentaquark states with narrow width , @xmath18 and @xmath4 .",
    "the masses for the @xmath77 and @xmath98 states are predicted to be @xmath155 gev and @xmath182 gev , which are much below the @xmath151 threshold and the @xmath22 threshold , respectively . since only the @xmath7-wave decay to @xmath6 channel",
    "is allowed , they should be extremely narrow states . concerning the mass difference between @xmath18 and @xmath4 states",
    ", we can not say anything definitely , because the masses depend on the values of the effective continumm threshold in the present calculation .",
    "the qcd sum rule also shows the possibility of the existence of the @xmath198 states .",
    "the positive parity states may be broader than the negative parity states since they are allowed to decay into @xmath20-wave @xmath6 state .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this is the first qcd sum rule analysis of high spin ( @xmath33 ) states of the pentaquark .",
    "the important point is that this work suggests possible existence of the high spin states in the same energy region as the @xmath36 states obtained by qcd sum rule in ref.@xcite .",
    "this abnormal spectra of the pentaquark are contrast to the ordinary baryon spectra .",
    "it is also remarkable that the exotic spin and parity , @xmath199 , leads to the existence of extremely narrow states .",
    "it would be interesting to see if lattice calculation could confirm our findings since most of the existing works using qcd sum rules or lattice qcd have concentrated on @xmath16 pentaquark states .    finally , we would like to give a comment on the present formalism of qcd sum rules , which has been widely used for pentaquark .",
    "the formalism is a simple extension of that for the ordinary hadrons .",
    "one of the subtle problems in qcd sum rules for pentaquark is how to properly extract a resonance in the contamination of the background continuum states .",
    "before we obtain a final conclusion for the pentaquark study with the qcd sum rule , it is a necessary process to examine the validity of the qcd sum rule formalism for exotic hadrons . in order to settle this problem , further experimental and theoretical studies on excited states and other pentaquark states with their spin and parity are desired .",
    "it is also useful to compare the lattice qcd calculations with the qcd sum rule results .    #",
