    "even though our discussion is focused on condensation in a real - space hh model , its conclusions extend to a variety of systems in which the energy dispersion of the bands shows multiple degenerate minima . in the longer run , this topological model raises a number of intriguing questions such as the possibility of observing quantum hall effects in momentum space and creating new phases of matter under the effect of nonlocal interactions .",
    "this work was funded by erc through the qgbe grant , by the eu - fet proactive grant aqus , project no .",

    "\" we thank monika aidelsburger for useful exchanges on their experiments and nigel cooper for stimulating discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we give more details on the calculation of the polyakov loops for the real - space hh model in the @xmath188 case . we first discuss how to determine @xmath189 and @xmath77 .",
    "we define the fourier transform of the operators @xmath20 as @xmath190 where @xmath191 , with @xmath192 being an integer and @xmath193 .",
    "the sum over the wave vectors is restricted to the first magnetic brillouin zone . in this basis , the momentum - space hamiltonian is @xmath194 then , when @xmath49 , the momentum - space hamiltonian is a real symmetric matrix , which means that we can diagonalize the matrix by an orthogonal matrix .",
    "then , the transformation to the band basis can be done by a real matrix , and thus the berry connection along @xmath44 is zero [ @xmath195 .",
    "the orthogonal matrix can also be taken as being smooth as one changes @xmath44 and periodic as @xmath196 , which implies that the wave function along @xmath49 is fully periodic in mbz and the transition function associated with this berry gauge choice is zero [ @xmath197 .",
    "then , the polyakov loop in the @xmath44 direction is zero , @xmath198 . on the other hand , in our chosen gauge ( [ ourberrygauge ] ) , @xmath199 , which then gives @xmath200 .",
    "next , we discuss how to evaluate @xmath201 to determine @xmath63 . here",
    "we use a different convention for the fourier transformation , corresponding to a different choice of the berry gauge . instead of ( [ fourier2 ] ) , we can choose to transform by @xmath202 where the sum is over the first full ( not magnetic ) brillouin zone ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "then , we obtain the following hamiltonian in momentum space : @xmath204 where the basis is @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 and the overall factor @xmath209 .",
    "then , when @xmath210 , the momentum - space hamiltonian is a real symmetric matrix , and thus the @xmath211 component @xmath58 of the berry connection along the @xmath210 line is zero for all @xmath43 .    under a wave - vector shift @xmath212 with @xmath54 ,",
    "the spectrum of @xmath213 is unchanged , while the eigenvectors experience a shift in their components , @xmath214 .",
    "since @xmath213 is an irreducible matrix with all the off - diagonal elements being nonpositive , the perron - frobenius theorem ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) guarantees that for all @xmath43 the components of the smallest eigenvector can be taken as all positive .",
    "therefore under a smooth variation @xmath212 the eigenvector is smoothly scanned @xmath214 without acquiring any extra factor . as a result , the transition phase in the considered gauge is @xmath215 . using the definition ( [ poly_y ] ) , it is straightforward to see that the polyakov loop is also @xmath216 .",
    "thanks to the gauge independence of @xmath217 , this immediately implies that in our original berry gauge choice ( [ ourberrygauge ] ) one has @xmath79 .",
    "here we sketch the derivation of the interaction hamiltonian of the momentum - space harper - hofstadter model .",
    "we first expand the annihilation operator in the fourier series according to ( [ fourier2 ] ) because , as noted above , with this fourier transformation convention , the berry connection along the @xmath49 line can be taken to be zero , @xmath218 , which is in accord with the landau gauge we want to choose .",
    "then , the interaction in momentum space reads @xmath219 now , we restrict the momenta in the sum to take the values only at the dispersion minima @xmath152 , where @xmath153 or @xmath154 . other momenta",
    "are also responsible for forming the momentum - space localized wannier states , but the momentum dependence of the interaction in the momentum - space tight - binding model is correctly captured by this approximation .",
    "we then transform @xmath220 into the band basis .",
    "explicitly , the transformation for @xmath221 is @xmath222 where we ignored the contribution from the higher bands .",
    "similarly , for the other three momenta , we obtain @xmath223 substituting ( [ transformation1 ] ) and ( [ transformation2 ] ) into ( [ hint1 ] ) , one obtains the momentum - space interaction hamiltonian  ( [ hamint ] ) .                                                                    c. r. dean , l. wang , p. maher , c. forsythe , f. ghahari , y. gao , j. katoch , m. ishigami , p. moon , m. koshino , t. taniguchi , k. watanabe , k. l. shepard , j. hone , and p. kim , nature ( london ) * 497 * , 598 ( 2013 ) .",
