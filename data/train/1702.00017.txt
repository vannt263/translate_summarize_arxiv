    "an important achievement of ads / cft duality @xcite is the holographic computation of the universal value of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density @xcite .",
    "finite t  hooft coupling corrections on the gauge theory side correspond to @xmath1 corrections on the gravity side , inclusion of which will modify the ratio thus violating the conjectured viscosity bound @xcite .",
    "that seems to indicate a strong link between the actual form of the lagrangian and the holographic transport coefficients and this relation was implicit in the further exploration of the field .",
    "the computation of the speed of sound @xcite in the dual theory assumes this idea and a bound was also supposed to exist @xcite .",
    "the fact that different gravity lagrangians are the key to describing different speeds of sound was extensively used in the literature until recently ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this letter is to obtain a universal formula for the the holographic speed of sound .",
    "the crucial point is that when the mass of the scalar field is in the breitenlohner - freedman ( * bf * ) window @xcite @xmath2 the holographic speed of sound depends as much on the details of the scalar field potential as it does on the boundary conditions that the scalar field satisfies .",
    "the universal formula we obtain takes the details of this relation into account .    in order to do this ,",
    "we face the problem of solving the bulk theory .",
    "we tackle this by means of a generalization of the designer gravity soliton line @xcite , an idea already considered in @xcite and also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the key point is that scalar fields satisfying ( [ window ] ) admit an infinite number of possible boundary conditions , which can be traced back to the existence , in any dimension , of two normalizable modes @xcite . in general",
    ", these boundary conditions can break the conformal symmetry in the boundary @xcite ( the implications of these boundary conditions for the energy of the hairy black holes and their thermodynamics were investigated in great detail in @xcite ) .",
    "when the scalar field mass is in the bf window ( [ window ] ) , it provides two asymptotic integration constants ( @xmath3 ) to the system .",
    "in addition , a static black hole metric provides one extra integration constant , @xmath4 , related to its mass .",
    "the solution space of the fully back - reacted metric plus the scalar field is characterized by three integration constants @xcite .",
    "the solution of the non - linear system of differential equations provides the map@xmath5 where @xmath6 are the horizon data , namely the value of the scalar field at the horizon , @xmath7 , and the normalized black hole area is the entropy density . ] , @xmath8 .",
    "the proof that dependence on @xmath8 of the map is universal and related only to the mass of the scalar field is the second essential result of this letter .",
    "in this article we focus on finite temperature solutions .",
    "for the zero temperature case , a similar analysis could be done in the lines of @xcite , with the introduction of an @xmath9 factor in the near horizon geometry @xcite .",
    "we begin with a concise review of deformations of the gauge theory along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we explicitly construct the map that allows us to obtain a black hole line that can be used to get a general formula for the speed of sound .",
    "this formula is universal as is valid for all boundary conditions .",
    "then , we present an explicit example in type iib supergravity and discuss the physics of a marginal deformation . we discuss how our result is valid for any value of the coupling constant of the deformation and its relation to the renormalization group ( * rg * ) flow in the gauge theory .",
    "it is worth remarking that this is different than the usual rg flow of the relativistic holographic fluid and speed of sound at a fixed cut - off which were presented in @xcite . in the last section we provide a formula for any scalar field with a mass in the range ( 1 ) .",
    "here we briefly review the relation between the field theory deformation and its holographic interpretation . in field theory",
    "one would like to add to the action a functional of the form @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary function of a single trace operator @xmath12 .",

    "the source associated with the vev is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this follows from the transformed action @xmath32 in this case the variation of the partition function at @xmath33 yields the result @xmath34 when the field theory is at finite temperature , different deformations correspond to different thermodynamic properties that are constrained by the bulk dynamics .",

    "it is a consequence of the fall - off of the scalar ( [ phi1 ] ) that , asymptotically , @xmath48 the derivative of this relation with respect to @xmath49 yields @xmath50 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 we see that @xmath22 is generically a function of @xmath7 times a very precise function of the normalized black hole area .",

    "the terms proportional to the variation of @xmath68 cancel if and only if @xmath69 the equations ( [ map 1 ] ) , ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) define the black hole surface .",
    "deformations that intersect the black hole surface can be associated with thermal states when the field theory is at finite temperature .",
    "a useful consequence of the general considerations made so far , it is that there are two @xmath70independent functions @xmath71 the characterization of the speed of sound for a single scalar field theory can then be reduced to finding the black hole line@xmath72 ads - invariant boundary conditions correspond to @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a fixed number . in this case the energy density , pressure and speed of sound are automatically@xmath75 where the partial derivative is taken at fixed source , @xmath76 .",

    "yields the dependence of the speed of sound on the vev @xmath23 associated with the source @xmath85 .",
    "note that the formula ( [ speed1 ] ) is universal and can be constructed for any theory in terms of its black hole line and boundary condition .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the second term in does not have a definite sign , so a priori it is not clear if the speed of sound for these theories will be bounded by the conformal value @xmath86 .",
    "we also note that ( [ speed1 ] ) indeed reproduces the result for a gas of massless particles for ads invariant boundary conditions where @xmath87 .    in order to further study the thermodynamics for different boundary conditions one needs to construct the black hole line . a minimal example that captures",

    "using the standard ads / cft dictionary , the operator dual to @xmath23 is @xmath12@xmath91 where the @xmath92 are the super yang - mills scalars @xcite .",
    "the ads background with @xmath93 is maximally supersymmetric .",
    "black hole solutions dressed with non - trivial scalars can be easily constructed numerically using a simple shooting method .",
    "doing so for the theories determined from the potential we find the black hole line shown in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "the function @xmath94 acquires a minimum at @xmath95 at which @xmath96 . in fig [ fig2 ]",
    "we display the surface @xmath97 alongside with the boundary condition @xmath98 .",
    "their intersection defines a uni - parametric family of black holes as described above .",
    "note that because of the reflection symmetry @xmath99 , the black hole surface satisfies @xmath100 ( to ease visualization the region of negative @xmath22 , @xmath23 is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , our numerics indicate that black holes with different signs of @xmath22 and @xmath23 can not exist .    0.4    0.4    [ fig : cs2 ]    for the linear boundary condition @xmath101 , we plot the speed of sound as a function of @xmath102 in fig .",
    "2  for this deformation the energy density is obtained by replacing @xmath103 and @xmath104 in ( [ dens ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath105 .",
    "this is indeed an everywhere positive convex function for all the deformations we are considering . in the plots we have set @xmath106 .",
    "so , when @xmath107 , then @xmath102 is very large and the deformed theory explores very high energies , where the conformal value for the speed of sound is recovered as one would expect .",
    "when @xmath108 then @xmath109 and the deformation vanishes .",
    "the conformal value for the speed of sound is again recovered in this limit . in the intermediate regime",
    "the speed of sound is larger than the conformal value , so it appears to be a very interacting state of matter which might be relevant for the description of neutron stars , where the speed of sound is believed to be bounded only by the speed of light @xcite .",
    "we note that the conjectured bound ( @xmath110 ) for the speed of sound in theories with an holographic dual was only supposed to hold when there is no chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this bound was indeed shown to be violated when a chemical potential is introduced in @xcite . in this sense , this is the first example of the violation of the conjectured bound with an everywhere positive convex energy functional .",
    "the field theory variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 have an ambiguity when written in terms of the gravity variable @xmath111 , see .",
    "this is parametrized by the constant @xmath112 necessary to make the argument of the logarithm dimensionless .",
    "this is interpreted on the field theory side as a standard one - loop renormalization @xcite .",
    "we take the bare coupling constant @xmath113 and the bare field @xmath114 to be defined at the cutoff scale @xmath115 and the renormalized coupling constant @xmath116 and renormalized field @xmath117 defined at the mass scale @xmath118 .",
    "the independence of the bulk field from the renormalization procedure yields @xmath119 where the latter equality implies @xmath120 and @xmath121 or alternatively @xmath122 which has the form of a one loop renormalization of a dimensionless coupling constant @xcite . in the plot of the speed of sound of the previous section we have set @xmath123 , which means setting the renormalized coupling constant to one and measuring @xmath22 in terms of the scale given by @xmath124 : @xmath125",
    "the energy scale and the value of the dressed coupling constant are indeed necessary to compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment .",
    "a change in the values that we picked would imply a simple shift in the graph of figure 2 .",
    "although we have worked in five dimensions for scalar fields saturating the breitenlohner - freedman bound , our results are easily generalized to any spacetime dimension , @xmath126 , for any scalar field with masses between this bound and the unitarity bound .",
    "scalar fields with mass in the bf window ( [ window ] ) fall - off as @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 is not an integer @xcite .",
