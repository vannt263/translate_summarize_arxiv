    ", it produced the first @xmath44 hour deep data in two separate 25 arcmin@xmath5 fields in the central part of goods - s .",
    "+      apart from the igoods and iudf programs , there exists a wealth of ultradeep irac archival data from various programs ( most of which are discussed in , e.g. , ashby et al .",
    "2013 , ashby et al .",
    "table [ tab : observations ] provides an overview of the programs , the respective pis , the number of exposures and total integration time .",
    "we downloaded all data from the spitzer heritage archive and combined them with our data sets , reducing all in a consistent manner , and coadding them into one ultradeep mosaic .",
    "the 7 programs are divided up in 353 astronomical observation requests ( aors ) , consisting of 33439 exposures , and totaling 3.47 ms ( 962.6 hours ) in each of the @xmath0  and @xmath1  filters for a total of 1925 hours of irac data . at the deepest location the coverage reaches @xmath45 hours at @xmath0  and @xmath46 hours at @xmath1  over an area of @xmath47 arcmin@xmath5 .",
    "the reduction of the irac data was carried out starting with the corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcd ) generated by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) calibration pipeline . a custom pipeline written by il",
    "was used to post - processes and mosaic the cbcd frames .",
    "the reduction pipeline was also used for reducing the simple irac legacy survey ( pi van dokkum ) and described in detail in damen et al .",
    "+      the reduction uses a two pass procedure . the first pass",
    "comprises background structure removal , artifact correction , persistence masking , and a first - pass coaddition .",
    "first , a median image is constructed from all frames in the aor , to remove background or bias structure and artifacts , and it is subtracted from each frame . then the cbcds are inspected and additional artifacts are corrected .",
    "the most important effect is residual column - pulldown and pull - up .",
    "the pull - up / down , caused by bright stars or cosmic rays at levels @xmath48 mjy / sr in @xmath0  and @xmath1 , shifts the intensities of the column above and below in slightly different ways .",
    "we correct for it by subtracting a median above and below the affected pixels after excluding any sources .",
    "persistence from very bright stars , leaving positive residuals on subsequent readouts of the array , is masked by rejecting all highly exposed pixels in the subsequent 4 frames ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "a constant background pedestal is determined and subtracted from each frame , by iteratively masking pixels associated with sources and determining the mode of the remaining background pixels .",
    "finally the post - processed cbcd frames of each aor are registered and median combined and a median absolute deviation ( mad ) map is calculated ( reflecting the uncertainty in the combined output pixels ) .",
    "the data are very well dithered , hence the images are free from deviant pixels and can be used to create an object mask .",
    "the second pass comprises cosmic ray rejection , astrometric calibration , background structure removal , and a final coaddition .",
    "first , the first - pass median image is de - registered and subtracted from each frame .",
    "the difference images are divided by the mad uncertainty image and used as detection maps for cosmic rays and hot / cold pixels .",
    "pixels are flagged if they deviate more then 4.5@xmath50 , while pixels adjacent to outliers are iteratively clipped at a more aggressive @xmath51 threshold .",
    "the first - pass image is also used to calibrate the astrometry .",
    "the frames in an aors are corrected for a simple shift in ra and dec using sources in common with the deep wfc3 maps of 3d@xmath52hst ( skelton et al .",
    "these maps are convenient as they include the wfc3 observations of the candels / goods - south , the wfc3 ers , and the hudf + parallel fields .",
    "the rms residuals of individual irac source positions is @xmath53 rms with systematic differences on scales of a few arcmin of @xmath54 .",
    "the skelton et al .",
    "( 2014 ) astrometry was calibrated to the candels / goods - south ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) mosaics and to the gems ( rix et al . 2004 ) mosaic for the hudf parallel fields .",
    "a new median background structure map is created from all frames in the aor , this time masking objects and outlier pixels .",
    "the frames are then drizzled ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) per aor using a pixfrac=0.2 on reference grid defined by the candels tangent point and a fine @xmath55 pixel scale .",
    "a final background was subtracted by iteratively clipping pixels belonging to objects and subtracting the mode of the background pixels . finally , the aors are weighted by the exposure time per pixel and combined into the ultradeep mosaic . the cryogenic observations ( goods and udf2 ) data sets at @xmath0  are @xmath3730% more sensitive than those of the warm mission",
    "hence we increase their contribution to the final mosaic and exposure time maps by a factor 1.7 .",
    "there are no significant differences in sensitivity in @xmath1 .",
    "the data release includes the full - depth mosaics in both @xmath0  and @xmath1 , as well as mosaics for each aor in both filters ( 353 total , on the same grid and final mosaic position angle ) .",
    "+      accurate point spread functions are needed to facilitate irac photometry using psf fitting techniques or using the high resolution hst imaging as a prior .",
    "empirical psfs created from the reduced mosaics are preferable , as the observation and reduction processes change the psfs in subtle ways . however , extracting clean psfs to large radii and high dynamic range is challenging due to crowding of neighboring sources and the small number of stars usually available in deep blank fields . to complicate matters , the layout and different rotation angles of the aors cause the effective psf of the combined mosaic to change rapidly on small spatial scales .    to solve this",
    "we generate a spatially varying irac psf .",
    "first we take advantage of the optical stability and the fine sampling to generate one template `` super psf '' at @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "two hundred stars were identified in deep hst imaging based on their fwhm and magnitude ( e.g. , skelton et al . 2014 ) and requiring an axis ratio of @xmath56 . at corresponding locations in each of the 353 aor mosaics ( which are on the same grid and pa as the full - depth mosaic ) ,",
    "image stamps of the stars were extracted to @xmath57 radius .",
    "saturated star images and those with @xmath58 were rejected .",
    "the remaining 2050 star images were then rotated to the native orientation of the irac frames to align the psf features . subsequently the images were normalized and median stacked , sigma clipping outlier pixels due to neighboring objects .",
    "the stacking was iterated three times while growing the outlier masks by 1 pixel in each iteration .",
    "note that some stars are imaged in more than 100 distinct aors .",
    "therefore the distribution of position angles causes objects close to the stars to fall on different locations on the irac frames .",
    "this makes it easier to separate between true psf structure and faint signal from neigboring sources , turning the complex nature of the observations into an asset .",
    "the resulting template psfs are shown in figure [ fig : psf ] and are of much higher quality and snr than usual for deep extragalactic fields .",
    "the drizzling on a fine pixel scale of @xmath55 helps to recover high frequency features of the psf , while the large number of high snr images results in a dynamic range of @xmath59 .",
    "the second step is to combine the template psf in such a way that simulates the combination of the aor into the full - depth mosaic .",
    "we map the exposure time and rotation angles of each aor on a fine grid ( @xmath60 ) covering the output image .",
    "then we reconstruct the effective full - depth psf , by rotating at small radii ) . ] and weighting the template psf for each aor contributing to that grid location .",
    "figure [ fig : psfmap ] shows the reconstructed psfs in steps of @xmath61 arcmin , illustrating the strong spatial variation .",
    "bootstrap resampling the star list and repeating the process results in uncertainties much smaller than the spatial variation in constructed psf .",
    "this indicates that survey geometry has a much larger impact on the effective irac psf than the intrinsic variation of the psf over a single irac pointing .",
    "both the super psfs and the maps are made available in the data release .",
    "the reduced irac mosaics are shown in figure [ fig : mosaic ] and the corresponding coverage maps are shown figure [ fig : coverage ] .",
    "a color composite using @xmath62band , @xmath0 and @xmath1  is shown in figure [ fig : col ] .",
    "the combined observations of all previous programs results in extremely deep coverage , due in part to targeted observations over the hudf / xdf from the iudf and igoods programs , and in part from fortuitous overlap from archival data .",
    "the uncoordinated nature of the programs is revealed by the much smaller area covered in both filters simultaneously : the area is smaller by a factor of @xmath63 at @xmath6 hr and factors of @xmath27 at @xmath44 hours ) .",
    "simultaneous coverage is crucial for placing constraints on emission line strengths and stellar masses at @xmath2 ( e.g. , labb et al .",
    "presently , two small ultradeep ( @xmath64 hr ) areas in goods - s exist ( 9 arcmin@xmath5 in @xmath0  and @xmath1  each ) .",
    "the final mosaics are cosmetically clean and the background is flat to @xmath65mjy sr@xmath66 ( @xmath3731 mag / arcsec@xmath5 ab ) on scales of @xmath67 arcmin .",
    "the small area that reaches to @xmath64 hours allows us to evaluate the improvement in background noise relative to the existing deep @xmath68 hour integrations .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : improvement ] the improvement is obvious in both irac bands , with large increases in the number of detected ultrafaint sources and in the snrs of brighter objects .",
    "the image quality of the full depth mosaics is excellent and constant over the field .",
    "the 1-d gaussian full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) over the field is @xmath69 at @xmath0  and @xmath70 at @xmath1 .",
    "these values are identical to those of the cryogenic goods v0.3 public data release , and 20% smaller than those of the seds ( pid 60022 ; ashby et al .",
    "2013 ) and simple mosaics ( pid 20708 ; damen et al .",
    "the difference with the latter two programs is due to the native irac pixels undersampling the psf and using drizzling instead of interpolation when resampling the irac frames .",
    "we verify the photometric calibration by comparing the fluxes of bright sources ( @xmath71 mag ab ) in @xmath72 diameter aperture to earlier measurements .",
    "the agreement with the irac @xmath0  and @xmath1  imaging of the spitzer extended deep survey ( seds ; ashby et al .",
    "2013 ) is excellent ( @xmath73 offset ) . comparing to cryogenic goods - s imaging ( pid 194 , pi dickinson , data release dr3 ) reveals that the goods fluxes are brighter by 8% and 2% in @xmath0  and @xmath1respectively .",
    "this is due to a change in bcd pipeline calibration : the fluxconv values reported in the pid 194 headers ( goods dr3 , v0.30/v0.31 , bcd pipeline s10.5.0 ) are 7% and 1% brighter than the fluxconv values in the most recent calibrations of the same data ( bcd pipeline version s18.25.0 ) .",
    "comparisons to our own reduction of the recalibrated goods data shows no offset .",
    "the total integration times of the mosaics ( @xmath74 hours ) run well into the classical `` source confusion '' regime for low background extragalactic observations , where crowding by nearby sources affects the reliability of photometry .",
    "the classical confusion limit predicted by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) is @xmath75jy ( @xmath76 ab mag ) , but in reality confusion is not a hard limit .",
    "for example , the classical limit is strictly speaking not relevant when the positions of the sources are known a priori . in goods - south and the hudfs",
    "deep ( @xmath77 ) , high - resolution ( fwhm@xmath78 ) hst / wfc3 imaging is available and the irac images are registered to the wfc3 images to very high accuracy ( @xmath54 systematic ) . using the source positions and sizes in the high resolution image , combined with knowledge of the psfs of wfc3 and irac , it is possible extract the source flux by modeling the irac surface brightness distribution .",
    "although surface brightness distribution can vary with wavelength , such procedures already greatly reduce the effect of confusion and open up the possibility of extracting fluxes well beyond the classical limit .",
    "prior based photometric techniques on blended sources and multi - resolution data sets have been used by many groups in the past with good results ( e.g. , fernandez - soto et al .",
    "1999 , papovich et al .",
    "2001 , shapley et al .",
    "2005 , labb et al .",

    "2007 , desantis et al .",
    "2007 , laidler et al . 2007 ) .",
    "as demonstrated in figure [ fig : diag ] these techniques can work extremely well .",
    "note that the photon noise for most sources is negligible compared to the background noise .",
    "therefore , when sources can be modeled and subtracted perfectly , most of the field can be considered empty sky from the perspective of faint source detection .    while good results can already be obtained by simple psf fitting ( i.e. , assuming point sources and a negligible size of the high resolution wfc3 psf ) , for the best results and smallest residuals near the cores of bright sources , it is necessary to account for both the source size and the detailed shape of the wfc3 and irac psf",
    "this can be done by convolving the isolated high resolution object by a kernel , constructed by deconvolving the low resolution psf by the high resolution psf ( e.g. , labb et al .",
    "2003 , labb et al .",
    "+      the large variation in integration time makes it possible to study the relation between sensitivity and integration time using prior based photometry .",
    "we measure the sensitivity limits of the irac images by placing artificial sources of zero flux on 15,0000 random locations in the mosaic and extracting their flux using the wfc3 image as a prior , as previously described and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] . to enable straightforward comparisons with other noise measurements",
    ", we do not use the best - fit flux directly but subtract the best - fit model of all neighbors to give a `` cleaned '' image of the source .",
    "then we measure the unweighted flux in @xmath79 diameter circular apertures ( without further corrections for light outside the aperture ) .",
    "the histograms of extracted fluxes are shown in figure [ fig : noise ] ) , grouped in bins of integration time .",
    "as expected , the scatter histogram becomes progressively narrower with increasing integration time , with no evidence for bias even at the largest integration times . to compare to the scatter expected from pure background noise , we compute for each fake source the local background rms in empty regions of the residual image ( away from bright sources ) .",
    "we bin by @xmath80 pixels ( @xmath81 ) to approximate the area of a @xmath79 aperture .",
    "the local empty background rms is optimistic and only representative of the uncertainty in absence of confusion .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : noise ] ) ( _ right _ ) the two estimates agree very well for 90% of the sources : the histogram of the ratio of aperture flux to local background error resembles a standard normal @xmath82  distribution .",
    "there is a slight skew towards positive flux levels , indicated by excess positive residuals for @xmath83 of the sources in the @xmath84 range . about @xmath85 of the fluxes",
    "deviate by more than @xmath86 ( 10% high , 2% low ) , nearly all due to strong residuals near the centers of very bright irac sources . about @xmath87 deviate because of confusion in the high resolution wfc3 prior image .",
    "we further investigate the relationship between contamination fraction and integration time , defining `` strongly contaminated '' as @xmath22 deviations from the local empty background rms .",
    "using simple aperture photometry ( e.g. , sextractor ) on the full - depth mosaics we find high contamination fractions : @xmath88 at @xmath0  and @xmath89 in @xmath1 .",
    "there is only a weak trend of contamination with integration time , likely because most flux comes from moderately bright sources and the psf surface brightness profile is steep at small radii @xmath90 ( e.g. , spitzer observer manual , som , section 6.2.4.1.5 ) . for the cleaned photometry",
    "there is no trend with integration time over @xmath10 hour ( and a constant @xmath91 contamination ) .",
    "hence prior based cleaning reduces the contamination fraction for these data sets by a constant factor @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig : depth ] shows the relation between sensitivity and integration time based on the simulated sources .",
    "the noise decreases with a power - law slope of @xmath93 in both irac bands .",
    "the decrease is only slightly slower ( at @xmath94 significance in each filter ) than the @xmath95 expected for poisson noise .",
    "following the definition of the irac integration time calculator ( sens - pet ) , we convert aperture scatter to point source sensitivity by square root scaling the noise to an equivalent area of @xmath96arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "this area represents the number of `` noise pixels '' ( see som table 6.1 ) , which would effectively contribute to the uncertainty of linear least - squares fit of a point source .",
    "this amounts to optimal weighting by the psf and improves the snr by @xmath97 compared to unweighted apertures .",
    "+ the best fit in magnitudes is : @xmath98 @xmath99    or equivalently in flux densities :    @xmath100    @xmath101    which gives the median point source sensitivity as function of integration time in hours .",
    "no evidence is found for a confusion limit or noise floor , although the relation is consistently @xmath102 less deep than predicted by sens - pet for low background conditions .",
    "a possible explanation for the lower sensitivity is residual confusion by , e.g. , sources below our detection limit or a background of faint overlapping psf wings at larger radii than our psf model .",
    "note that the true uncertainty for individual sources can be much higher than the median if the source is located close to a bright neighbor .",
    "+      the data release consists of reduced images of all ultradeep irac observations in the goods - south .",
    "the images are available from the iudf website and the infrared science archive[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( irsa ) . + the data release contains the following :    * science images and exposure time maps in both @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "our reduction uses the same tangent point as candels on pixel scales of @xmath55 , so the irac maps can be easily rebinned and registered to hst / wfc3 data .",
    "* reduced images of all individual 353 aors , drizzled onto the same grid , which may be useful to study the reliability or variability of sources .",
    "* template psfs and spatial maps of the weights and position angles of each aor , allowing the reconstruction of the psf at arbitrary locations .",
    "example idl code is provided .",
    "the units of the science images are @xmath103mjy / sr , where constant c=16.54 represents the change from the native irac pixel scale to 0.3\" / pixel due to flux conservation during the reduction process .",
    "equivalently , flux densities can be obtained by multiplying the image pixel values by 34.994 @xmath104jy / pixel , corresponding to an image ab zeropoint of 20.04 .",
    "one of the main goals of the iudf program is to obtain high snr ( @xmath22 ) at @xmath28 and @xmath29 m for normal @xmath105 galaxies in the epoch of reionization . comparing the detection rates of @xmath106 galaxies at @xmath21 to previous deep irac observations from the goods program ( pid 194 )",
    ", we find that @xmath107 hour goods data yields snr@xmath22 measurements for 25 - 30% of the sources , compared to 75 - 80% for @xmath108 hour in the iudf images .    here",
    "we provide several examples of objects detected in the iudf images . in figure [",
    "fig : highz ] we show 4 ultrafaint sub - l * galaxies at @xmath109 .",
    "the galaxies are clearly detected at high significance in the new images , compared to the earlier 50 hour deep images . in the deeper images a clear difference in observed irac color",
    "is seen between the @xmath24 and @xmath41 galaxies , likely due to strong [ ] + @xmath110 line emission moving from @xmath0  to @xmath1  with increasing redshift .",
    "these differences were recently demonstrated in stacked seds ( e.g. , labb et al .",
    "2013 ) and in small samples of brighter and lensed galaxies ( smit et al .",
    "2014 , smit et al .",
    "2015 ) , but are now apparent even in individual sub - l * galaxies .",
    "this shows the potential of @xmath111 hour data for placing improved constraints on the emission line strengths of individual galaxies ( @xmath112 [ ] at @xmath113 and [ ] + @xmath110 at @xmath12 ) .",
    "furthermore , ultradeep irac data may be the only way to detect potentially important overlooked constituents of the high redshift universe until the arrival of jwst .",
    "massive m@xmath114m@xmath115 passive galaxies at @xmath19 can be too faint to be detected by hubble and even actively star forming , dusty galaxies with sfr @xmath38m@xmath115/yr could have escaped detection by both hubble and existing fir / sub - mm surveys at these redshifts .",
    "enigmatic irac - selected `` hst - dropouts '' have been identified on the basis of their very red @xmath116 colors ( e.g. , huang et al .",
    "2011 , caputi et al .",
    "the origin of these objects is unknown as it is difficult to determine their redshifts , but the observed seds of some galaxies can be fit with quiescent galaxy models at high redshift @xmath19",
    ". if this interpretation is correct , then these objects are the quenched remnants of massive starbursts at earlier times , and they provide compelling targets for early jwst spectroscopic follow up .",
    "such a population likely places powerful constraints on models for star formation quenching , and may inform us indirectly about high mass star formation during the epoch of reionization .",
    "the iudf and igoods programs are the deepest and most recent probes of the infrared emission at @xmath0  and @xmath1  with spitzer / irac , ideally suited for faint studies of high redshift galaxies . combining with all ultradeep archival data from all previous programs , and using consistent reduction procedures , we present reduced image mosaics reaching extremely deep coverage of @xmath74 hours and covering all of goods - s , the hudf / xdf , and the two hudf parallel fields . + in summary :    * we release the full - depth reduced science mosaics at @xmath0  and @xmath1 and the corresponding exposure time maps .",

    "* simulations are performed to quantify the confusion due to crowding by neighboring sources .",
    "we demonstrated using the new ultradeep 200 hour data that irac observations are not significantly impacted by confusion when using deep high resolution priors from hst / wfc3 . in the reduced mosaics @xmath120 of the area is originally contaminated by flux of neighboring sources .",
    "using hst - based priors reduces this to a constant @xmath91 , with no dependence on exposure time over the range @xmath10 hours .",
    "the remaining catastrophic outliers are nearly all very close to the centers of bright irac sources and in @xmath121 are even confused in the high resolution hst image . in general ,",
    "prior based photometry works very well , reducing the contamination fraction by @xmath92 . +",
    "* the simulations further demonstrate that the rms noise in the ultradeep irac images decreases nearly as the square root of integration time over the range @xmath10 hours , without any evidence for a hard confusion limit .",
    "the maximum @xmath11 point source sensitivities reaches as faint as of 15 njy ( 28.5 ab ) at @xmath0  and 19 njy ( 28.2 ab ) at @xmath1 .",
    "these sensitivities are systematically @xmath122 less deep than predicted by the irac etc ( sens - pet ) , likely due to residual effects of confusion .",
    "we provide fitting formulas in  4.3 to estimate the effective depth as a function of exposure time .",
    "+    the value of ultradeep irac data is illustrated by direct detections of sub - l * @xmath2 galaxies , where the joint measurement at @xmath0  and @xmath1  places constraints on the [ ] + @xmath110 emission line strengths of individual galaxies to very faint limits @xmath123 . future observations of larger samples over wider areas will become available as part of exploration science program greats ( goods reionization era widearea treasury from spitzer , pi labb ) , which will map part of goods - s and goods - n to 200 hours depth .",
    "these data offer the prospect of studying the distribution of inferred ews and comparions to the entire rest - frame seds , from hst to alma , will enable studies of the dust attenuation , ionization processes , and star formation histories . the combined hst+spitzer ultradeep imaging legacy will be useful for planning efficient imaging and spectroscopic follow - up surveys with jwst and provide interesting targets for the first cycles of jwst nirspec observations .",
