    "game theory provides a useful framework for describing the evolution of systems consisting of selfish individuals @xcite .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma game ( pdg ) as a metaphor for investigating the evolution of cooperation has drawn considerable attention @xcite . in the pdg",
    ", two players simultaneously choose whether to cooperate or defect .",
    "mutual cooperation results in payoff @xmath1 for both players , whereas mutual defection leads to payoff @xmath2 gained both . if one cooperates while the other defects , the defector gains the highest payoff @xmath3 , while the cooperator bears a cost @xmath4 .",
    "this thus gives a simply rank of four payoff values : @xmath5 .",
    "one can see that in the pdg , it is best to defect regardless of the co - player s decision to gain the highest payoff @xmath3 .",
    "however , besides the widely observed selfish behavior , many natural species and human being show the altruism that individuals bear cost to benefit others .",
    "these observation brings difficulties in evaluating the fitness payoffs for different behavioral patterns , even challenge the rank of payoffs in the pdg .",
    "since it is not suitable to consider the pdg as the sole model to discuss cooperative behavior , the snowdrift game ( sg ) has been proposed as possible alternative to the pdg , as pointed out in ref @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the pdg and the sg is in the order of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , as @xmath6 in the sg .",
    "this game , equivalent to the hawk - dove game , is also of much biological interest @xcite .",
    "however , the original pdg and sg can not satisfyingly reproduce the widely observed cooperative behavior in nature and society .",
    "this thus motivates numerous extensions of the original model to better mimic the evolution of cooperation in the real world @xcite .",
    "since the spatial structure is introduced into the evolutionary games by nowak and may @xcite , there has been a continuous effort on exploring effects of spatial structures on the cooperation @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the spatial structure promotes evolution of cooperation in the pdg @xcite , while in contrast often inhibits cooperative behavior in the sg @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "extensive studies indicate that many real networks are far different from regular lattices , instead , show small - world and scale - free topological properties .",
    "hence , it is naturally to consider evolutionary games on networks with these kinds of properties @xcite .",
    "an interesting result found by santos and pacheco is that  scale - free networks provide a unifying framework for the emergence of cooperation \" @xcite .",
    "so far , most studies of evolutionary games over networks are based on static network structure .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the network structure may coevolve with the game @xcite , where each individual would choose its co - players to gain more benefits , inducing the evolution of their relationship network .",
    "some previous works about weighted networks suggest that it is indeed the traffic increment spurs the evolution of the network to maintain the system s normal and efficient functioning @xcite . from this perspective ,",
    "in the present paper we propose an evolutionary model with respect to the interplay between the evolutions of the game and the network for characterizing the dynamics of some social and economic systems .    in our model , the sg is adopted for its more general representation of the realism and evolutionary cooperative behavior . since growth is a common feature among networked systems @xcite",
    ", we assume that the network continuously grows by adding new agents to the existent network on the basis of the payoff preferential attachment .",
    "we focus on the evolution of the network structure together with the emergence and persistence of cooperation .",
    "simulation results show that the obtained networks follow a power - law distribution , @xmath7 , with exponent @xmath8 tuned by a model parameter .",
    "the average distance of the network scales logarithmically with the network size , which indicates the network has a small - world effect .",
    "interestingly , the assortative mixing properties generated by our model demonstrate that the model can well mimic social networks . in parallel , with the extension of the network ,",
    "the density of cooperators increases and approaches a stable value , which gives a new explanation for the emergence and persistence of cooperation .",
    "we also explore the wealth distribution , where the so - called wealth is the accumulated payoff distribution of each individual .",
    "the pareto law is well reproduced by our model . at last , we provide analyses for the obtained scale - free network structures .    the paper is arranged as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the model in detail , in sec .",

    "iv , the work is concluded .",
    "let us introduce briefly the sg first .",
    "consider two drivers are trapped in two side of a snowdrift .",
    "each driver has two possible selections , either shoving the snowdrift ( cooperator - c ) or remaining in the car and do nothing ( defect - d ) . if both cooperate , they could be back home on time , so that each will gain a reward of @xmath9 , whereas mutual defection results in still blocked by the snowdrift and each gets a payoff @xmath10 .",
    "if only one driver shovels ( takes c ) , then both drivers can be back home .",
    "the driver taking d gets home with do nothing and hence gets a payoff @xmath11 , while the driver taking c gains a  sucker \" payoff of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the rank of four payoff values is @xmath6 .",

    "it has been known that scale - free networks favor the emergence and persistence of cooperation @xcite .",
    "thus , the fact that @xmath49 in our model is larger than that of well - mixed cases is attributed to the emergence of scale - free structural properties .",
    "at the very beginning , the network evolves from a core of random - like structure , in which cooperation can not dominate in the game . while as the network gradually grows , power - law degree distribution emerges , which leads to a sharp increase of @xmath49 , as shown in fig . 4 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
