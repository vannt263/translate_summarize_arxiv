    "convection in binary mixtures occurs through a hopf bifurcation for sufficiently strong coupling between the thermal and the concentration field .",
    "this bifurcation is usually subcritical and leads to traveling waves .",
    "strikingly , they can form localized - wave trains ( ltw ) .",
    "two classes of ltw seem to exist : a discrete set of relatively short , pulselike structures , which resemble solitons in the nonlinear schrdinger equation , and longer ltw , which resemble a pair of fronts connecting the convective and the conductive state .",
    "previously , it seemed that the latter have arbitrary length .",
    "very recent experiments showed , however , that this is not the case and that their stable length is fixed , too [ kolodner , 1993 ] . in both cases",
    "the drift velocity is very small .",
    "theoretical efforts to understand the ltw within the framework of reduced equations like the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgl ) have focussed on different points of view : 1 ) considering the cgl as a perturbation of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , one can show the stability of short ltw [ thual & fauve , 1988 , fauve & thual , 1990 ] ; 2 ) in the weakly dispersive limit , i.e. when the imaginary parts of all of the coefficients in the cgl are very small , bound pairs of fronts can be stable with their distance diverging when the imaginary parts go to zero [ hakim _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 , hakim & pomeau , 1991 ] .",
    "in both approaches the discrepancy between the calculated linear group velocity @xmath0 and the considerably smaller observed velocity @xmath1 of the ltw requires that nonlinear contributions balance the linear group velocity over a range of parameters .    taking into account full numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations , which show the relevance of a large - scale concentration field [ barten _ et al . _ ,",
    "1991 ] , it has been suggested [ riecke , 1992 ] that the smallness of the drift velocity @xmath1 of the ltw is due to an additional slow time scale in the binary - mixture system . it arises due to the smallness of the lewis number @xmath2 , which measures the ratio of molecular to thermal diffusion , and leads to an additional dynamical degree of freedom  beyond the convective amplitude , which corresponds to a concentration mode .",
    "numerical simulations of the resulting coupled pde show that for small @xmath2 the pulse velocity is drastically reduced , and the effect of the group velocity @xmath0 on the pulse velocity is strongly diminished as compared to the conventional cgl .    in both cases described above [ fauve & thual ,",
    "1990,hakim & pomeau , 1990 ] the localization mechanism is due to the dispersion of the waves , i.e. no localization would be possible if the imaginary coefficients in the cgl vanished identically .",
    "the strong effect of the concentration mode on the velocity of the ltw raises the question whether localization could arise _ solely _ due to the concentration mode without any dispersion .",
    "here we make a first step towards answering this question .",
    "we investigate analytically single front solutions in the presence of this mean field and focus on the dispersionless case .",
    "the equations proposed in [ riecke , 1992 ] are @xmath3 they represent a minimal model for the mechanism of interest .",
    "the complete equations up to cubic order , including the values of the coefficients for free - slip - permeable boundary conditions , are given in [ riecke , 1992 ] .",
    "without dispersion , the real ginzburg - landau equation for the real amplitude , without coupling to the @xmath4-field and after a rescaling can be written as @xmath5 with @xmath6 in the subcritical case @xmath7 the potential @xmath8 has two relative minima for @xmath9 , one at @xmath10 and another at @xmath11 . at @xmath12",
    "the potential has the same value for the conductive state @xmath10 and for the convective state @xmath11 , and the front solution connecting the conductive state to the convective state is stationary .",
    "for @xmath13 the @xmath11 state invades the trivial state . due to the attractive interaction between the fronts , domains of definite size",
    "exist , they are , however , unstable .",
    "the size of these domains diverges when @xmath14 tends to @xmath15 and in this limit the localized unstable domain can be described perturbatively as a bound state of two fronts .",
    "the front between the trivial state and the convective state for @xmath16 is at rest for @xmath17 and has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . if @xmath21 and @xmath22 the front starts to move . in a frame",
    "moving with velocity @xmath1 , in which the front is stationary , eqs.([eqa])-([eqc ] ) read @xmath23 here @xmath24 has been absorbed into @xmath25 and @xmath4 . assuming @xmath26 and @xmath4 small , @xmath27 is a zeroth order approximation to the moving front , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in order to solve the inhomogeneous equation for @xmath4 we assume strong advection and",
    "expand @xmath4 in @xmath30 . in this limit eq.([eqc1 ] ) becomes a first - order equation and only the boundary condition on @xmath4 ahead of the front can be satisfied .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) one has @xmath33 for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . in order to satisfy the other boundary condition",
    "as well one has to take into account that in back of the front , where @xmath36 goes to zero , the term @xmath37 becomes dominant .",
    "this can be done using a suitable matching procedure . to obtain the velocity of a single front",
    "this is , however , not necessary .",
    "thus , one obtains @xmath38 this expansion is inserted into the equation for @xmath39 .",
    "the leading order equation is solved by @xmath27 . at @xmath40",
    "a solvability condition arises due to the translational symmetry of the system .",
    "projection onto the left zero - eigenvector @xmath41 yields an equation for the velocity @xmath1 , @xmath42 thus , for @xmath43 the absolute value of the velocity ( @xmath44 ) of a leading front ( @xmath45 ) is increased by the concentration field at leading order , whereas that of a trailing front ( @xmath46 ) is decreased .",
    "considering that positive values of @xmath4 increase the local growth rate of @xmath39 , this is expected and illustrated in fig.1 . there , two typical numerical solutions of eqs.([eqa])-([eqc ] ) are shown for @xmath45 and for @xmath46 . in both cases the positive concentration mode supports the growth of the convective state .",
    "eq.([e : sv ] ) suggests a hysteretic transition from fast fronts to slow fronts when the group velocity @xmath0 is decreased with the latter traveling opposite to the group velocity .",
    "although this transition occurs outside of the regime of validity of eq.([e : sv ] ) , this is in fact found in numerical simulations of eqs.([eqa])-([eqc ] ) [ herrero & riecke , in preparation ] and is reminiscent of a similar transition for pulses [ riecke , 1993 ] .",
    "experimentally of interest should be the fact that this transition in the front velocity can also be achieved by changing @xmath47 .",
    "due to our scaling of eqs.([eqa])-([eqc ] ) this is equivalent to changing the rayleigh number .",
    "thus , the velocity of a single front is expected to be strongly nonlinear in the rayleigh number whereas without the concentration mode it would be linear to lowest order .    in conclusion , we have investigated the influence of an additional mean field on the dynamics of propagating fronts in a real ginzburg - landau equation without dispersion .",
    "this is considered a first step towards the understanding of localized traveling - wave pulses which have been found in simulations of these equations and which appear to be similar to localized waves found in binary - mixture convection at strongly negative separation ratio . to treat the interaction of such fronts one",
    "has to take into account the slow decay of the concentration mode behind the front . in a limiting case",
    "in which the fronts are very steep this decay can be seen to be the dominant contribution to the interaction and can lead to stable bound states of two fronts , i.e. stable localized waves [ herrero & riecke , in preparation ] .    *",
