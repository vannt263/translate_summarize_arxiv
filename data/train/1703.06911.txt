    "in the absence of exact solutions non - linear differential equations of field theory manifest features that they can be simulated by some known potentials .",
    "linear equations with complicated potentials also can be treated similarly . in this",
    "regard we recall the @xmath1atom endowed with non - linear electromagnetic field due to born and infeld @xcite . in this approach basic idea was to eliminate the divergences due to point charges .",
    "the resulting regular electromagnetic potential expected to contribute to the solution of schrdinger equation and the ground state energy level was obtained remarkably as a simulation @xcite of the morse potential morse .",
    "being motivated by that study we wish to employ the same method to another well - known differential equation representing an analog of global monopole in flat spacetime .",
    "global monopoles are topological structures that emerge from spontaneous symmetry breaking and are believed to exist from the big bang .",
    "such a monopole was considered first by barriola and vilenkin bv as source of gravity which may go to the extend of forming black holes . in @xmath2dimensions",
    "the symmetry that has been broken is @xmath3 which ultimately reduces to @xmath4 . in this approach",
    "@xcite the scalar field triplet is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the gauge parameters , @xmath7 is the monopole charge and @xmath8 is the function to be determined .",
    "unfortunately the differential equation satisfied by @xmath9 does nt admit an exact analytical solution .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors satisfied by @xmath10 are such that @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "numerical integration of the resulting differential equation is at our disposal and our aim is to simulate such a global monopole equation by using a morse type potential . before extending our formalism to higher dimensions we consider the @xmath16dimensional analogue of the @xmath2dimensional global monopole . in @xmath16dimensions",
    "the gauge group to be broken becomes now @xmath17 so that the scalar doublet is represented by @xmath5 where @xmath18 the resulting differential equation for @xmath9 in @xmath16dimensions is as difficult as in the @xmath2dimensional case . as a matter of fact asymptotically the resulting equation is reminiscent of a minor variation of the third painlev transcendent @xcite encountered in the study of cylindrical gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this oscillatory solution , however , does nt represent the monopole character but yet arises as a distinct solution to the same differential equation satisfied by the monopole .",
    "in other words both types of solutions arise from the same differential equation with different initial conditions .",
    "morse potential fitting to the global monopole equation in @xmath16dimensions is observed to work perfectly .",
    "going to the lower dimension @xmath19 , the differential equation satisfied by @xmath9 is solved exactly as @xmath20 this is , however , a singlet field and it ca nt be interpreted as a global monopole since there is no symmetry breaking in the usual sense .",
    "reflection symmetry is the only available symmetry to be in @xmath21dimensional space .",
    "next , we interpolate our analysis to higher dimensions @xmath22 and repeat our method of morse simulation .",
    "we observe that as @xmath23 gets higher the fitting of our morse type potential becomes less reliable in comparison with the dimensions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let s start with the lagrangian of a global - monopole in @xmath16dimensional flat , spherically symmetric spacetime which is given by@xmath26here @xmath27 , @xmath28 is a coupling constant , @xmath7 is the monopole parameter and@xmath29for @xmath30 and @xmath31 to find the field equation for @xmath9 we express the field lagrangian in terms of @xmath9 only , i.e. , @xmath32now , variation of the action with respect to @xmath33 yields@xmath34or in more convenient form@xmath35 in which a prime stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the size of the global monopole in flat spacetime .",
    "we note that a scaling of the form @xmath38 absorbs the parameter , hence without loss of generality one can set @xmath39 note also that the term @xmath40 is as a result of symmetry breaking .",
    "let us note that eq .",
    "( 5 ) admits an asymptotic solution in analogy with the cylindrical gravitational waves expressed exactly in terms of painlev type iii @xcite .",
    "our case turns out to be@xmath41(for @xmath42constant ) which is comparable with the asymptotic solution given in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the solution of latter equation for @xmath43 and @xmath44 the solution is oscillatory for @xmath45 , asymptotes to one for @xmath46 and diverges for @xmath47 interestingly the decisive factor between the two types of solutions is the initial slope of the curve to start with . below certain value",
    "we have oscillations while above that we have the frozen global monopole solution .     with respect to @xmath36 for @xmath48 in flat spacetime .",
    "the initial conditions are set as @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 from the top / black - solid to the bottom / red - long dash .",
    "note that the shaded region corresponds to the inner region of global - monopole .",
    "we add also that depending on the initial slope eq .",
    "( 5 ) admits a wave like solution which is apart from the monopole . for completeness",
    "we have shown the latter as well.,width=264 ]     with respect to @xmath36 for @xmath48 in flat spacetime for the initial conditions are set as @xmath49 and @xmath53 and the morse function ( red - dash).,width=264 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we plot the numerical solution of eq . ( 5 ) which represents a global monopole with @xmath43 and the morse type function@xmath54 in which @xmath55 .",
    "obviously @xmath9 satisfies the conditions at @xmath56 and @xmath57",

    "4 we plot the exact solution ( 16 ) and the numerical solution found from the field equation .",
    "we see that they agree to high precision .",
    "this accuracy guides our numerical method in @xmath84 also to the higher dimensions .",
    "similar to @xmath85 for @xmath22 we can simulate the solution with a morse type function given by@xmath86 in which @xmath87 is the slope of the solution at @xmath56 and @xmath88 is an adjusting parameter . in table .",
    "1 we give @xmath87 for dimensions @xmath22 and in fig .",

    "having the solution of eq . ( 10 ) simulated by the morse type function is not a coincidence .",
    "the initial form of the morse potential can be written as @xcite@xmath91 in which @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are free positive parameters of the potential .",
    "this function has a minimum at @xmath95 and for large @xmath36 it approaches to @xmath96 setting @xmath97 and @xmath98 we find a function whose asymptotic behaviours are as we are expecting for @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) i.e. , @xmath99 and @xmath100  furthermore , for large @xmath36 i.e. , @xmath101 eq . ( 10 ) becomes independent of dimensions and therefore the solution must be asymptotically the same as the exact solution of ( 10 ) in @xmath67 given by ( 16 ) .",
    "hence we get@xmath102where @xmath103 is a positive constant which could be set according to the dimensions .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the right hand side in ( 19 ) surprisingly is of the morse type function i.e. , for large @xmath36@xmath104finally , for small @xmath36 i.e. , @xmath105 the field equation ( 10 ) becomes@xmath106with a solution given by@xmath107 in which @xmath108 and @xmath109 are constants .",
    "a regular solution at @xmath56 requires @xmath110 and the asymptotic solution for small @xmath36 becomes @xmath111 from the other hand the asymptotic behaviour of the morse potential ( 18 ) with @xmath97 and @xmath98 near @xmath56 becomes@xmath112which is same as @xmath113 in conclusion the morse type function in both limits i.e. , @xmath114 and @xmath15 matches very well with the solution of the field equation ( 10 ) . as we expect from the fig .",
    "5 , the maximum agreement occurs in these limits .",
    "irrespective of dimensions ( @xmath115 ) the geometry of a global monopole emerges complicated enough to be tackled with , even in a flat spacetime .",
    "the reason is the transcendental differential equation satisfied by the global monopole function @xmath113 asymptotically the equation satisfied by @xmath9 has similarity with the painlev type iii , whose behavior can be studied numerically .",
    "we have shown that the numerical plot of the function can be simulated by a morse type function to great accuracy .",
    "it is shown that the accuracy of our simulation works better in lower dimensions such as @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath67 is the only available case that admits exact integration , however , its significance as a monopole remains questionable .",
    "recalling that a global monopole constitutes a particular case of @xmath117 theories similar simulations may find application also in the latter theories .",
    "further , question can naturally be raised about the importance of such a simulation advocated herein : the physics of particles in the field of a monopole becomes tractable through the morse function .",
    "our project next is to extend the idea to global monopole in a curved spacetime ."
