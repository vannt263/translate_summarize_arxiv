    "anomalous high-@xmath0 events observed at hera by h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations in the early 1997 have provoked much efforts of their explanation within different theoretical frameworks . for the 1994 - 96 year data an excess of high @xmath0 events was at about 3@xmath9 level .",
    "later , these two collaborations reported an analysis with the 1997 year data included at the symposium on lepton - photon interactions  @xcite and very recently at desy seminar on the 13th of march , 1998  @xcite .",
    "the present statistics is more than doubled ( 46.6 pb@xmath10 - zeus and 37.04 pb@xmath10 - h1 ) in comparison with the statistics of the 1994 - 96 years ( 20.1 pb@xmath10 - zeus and 14.2 pb@xmath10 - h1 ) . the acceptance has also been increased . at present , for the 1994 - 97 data combined , the excess is at the @xmath11 level , for example , for the above - mentioned luminosity the number of observed events with @xmath12 gev@xmath13 is 7 ( zeus ) + 10 ( h1 ) = 17 , while the number of predicted events is only 5.3 ( zeus ) + 4.4 ( h1 ) = 9.7    basically there are three kinds of proposed explanations : + 1 ) contact - term interactions of very heavy bosons , heavy leptoquark - type objects being exchanged between a positron and a quark  @xcite ; + 2 ) non - standard evolution of the parton densities  @xcite ; + 3 ) leptoquark  @xcite or squark  @xcite resonance within the @xmath1-parity violated susy model .    the first two scenarios , as it has been shown , do not give quite a good explanation of hera events  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the possibility of the resonant @xmath14 production at hera which gives the most reasonable explanation of high @xmath0 events .",
    "one can expect resonance production of lq from valence ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) or sea ( @xmath17 ) quarks .    however , the resonance production of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is excluded by hera data for the @xmath20 mode with 1 pb@xmath10 statistics , because such signals would be seen in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonance production for quite a big coupling constant value of an order of 0.2  @xcite appearing in the scenario with a resonance in @xmath23 collisions .    on the other hand , the generally accepted leptoquark framework of ref .",
    "@xcite with a non - zero coupling only within one family is excluded for hera by the combined cdf+d   limit on the leptoquark mass of 240 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "this limit is established under the assumption that @xmath24 .",
    "but for hera , within this model , the branching ratio is fixed to unity if one takes into account the severe limit ( @xmath25 ) on the product of chiral couplings from the branching ratio of the leptonic pion decay  @xcite .",
    "that is why we would like to consider a more preferable , from our point of view scenario , when leptoquark appears as a scalar superpartner of a quark within the @xmath1-parity violating ( rpv ) susy model  @xcite .",
    "we would also like to update our previous paper  @xcite with the 1997 hera data included , namely , we consider a possibility of the @xmath1-parity violation provided @xmath26-channel resonance at hera for the scenario with several non - zero @xmath1-parity violating couplings takes place .",
    "the starting point for our analysis is the superpotential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath1-violating terms included @xmath27    couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 have the following properties : @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the terms with @xmath32 and @xmath33 violate a lepton number @xmath34 while the last term with @xmath35 violates a baryon number @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath34 violating operators , if they exist simultaneously , lead to a fast proton decay  @xcite .",
    "thus , only one kind of operators is allowed .",
    "hera events can be explained in the framework of the @xmath1-parity broken susy model only if @xmath37 .",
    "that is why we hereafter consider the case with @xmath38 .",

    "we have taken mass values from the figure of  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the events observed by the h1 collaboration ( @xmath41  gev@xmath13 ) are more concentrated around the invariant mass of 200 gev than the zeus events . in conclusion of ph97",
    "it was said that zeus and h1 data did not fit well together for the scenario with a single narrow resonance  @xcite .",
    "but the statistics and mass resolution are not enough at the moment to exclude completely the scenario with one resonance : for @xmath41 , 7 h1 events and 3 zeus events are in the mass window @xmath42 gev .",
    "moreover , one can obtain a broad mass distribution if a superposition of two close mass eigenstates is considered  @xcite .    in our calculations",
    "we have used the cteq3 m structure function  @xcite and @xmath0 scale equal to @xmath43 . the total cross section",

    "] , while the standard model gives only 0.16  pb .    we use the set of non - zero @xmath1-parity violating yukawa couplings , which has been described above .",
    "we use : + 1)@xmath44 , @xmath45 + or + 2)@xmath46 , @xmath45 .",
    "we have calculated the complete set of feynman diagrams for the process @xmath47 in the framework of the @xmath1-broken supersymmetric model for hera energy .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in fig.[diag - hera ] .",
    "as it is naturally expected , the main contribution comes from the diagrams with a resonant squark in the @xmath26-channel ( 99% ) .",
    "contribution from the @xmath48-channel diagram is negligible ( 1% ) for the case under consideration .",
    "however , these diagrams give the same order contribution as a _ nonresonant _ @xmath26-channel diagram with a heavy sparticle , but this is not the subject of our study .    in our calculations we assumed nlo corrections by introducing the @xmath49-factor equal to 1.25 for @xmath50 gev  @xcite .",
    "the presence of several non - zero couplings leads to the branching ratio @xmath51 equal to 50% .",
    "we obtained the value of @xmath33 equal to 0.038 which describes the event excess in hera data with the 200 gev @xmath26-channel squark resonance .",
    "[ heraq2 ] shows the @xmath0 distribution for the standard model and susy model with broken @xmath1-parity tuned to describe data and the combined zeus+h1 data distribution itself .",
    "one can see that the @xmath0 shape of deviation from sm is well described by the @xmath26-channel squark resonance .",
    "the presence of another non - zero coupling  @xmath52 or @xmath52 causes the flavour changing neutral current events : @xmath53 .",
    "+ leptonic and hadronic @xmath54-decay channels lead to the following signatures : + 1 ) @xmath55 or @xmath56@xmath57 ; + 2 ) di- or tri - jet events + @xmath58 .",
    "two outstanding fcnc events with a high @xmath59 @xmath60 signature have been observed by h1 collaboration and reported at jerusalem conference  @xcite .",
    "only 0.05 events were predicted by the sm in the kinematic region of these two events .",
    "the scenario with non - zero couplings describes well the kinematics of the observed events .",
    "if one takes into account the @xmath61 decay branching ratio equal to 17% , then one will have about 2 @xmath62 events which were observed by h1 collaboration .",
    "if the deviation from the sm for di- or tri - jet + @xmath58 events is found , it will be an additional favour for the scenario with several non - zero rpv couplings .",
    "having in mind that processes with @xmath1-parity violation could occur in @xmath63 collisions at lep , we consider the possibility of detecting it in the pair jet production via a sparticle exchange .",
    "deviation of the jet production rate from the sm at lep due to @xmath1-parity violating susy has been the subject of several papers  @xcite .",
    "comparing with the standard model , some excess in dijet production is expected . for this purpose",
    ", we have calculated the complete set of relevant diagrams presented in fig.[diag - lep ] .",
    "we consider the case with also non - zero @xmath64 .",
    "hereafter , we assume that sleptons have a mass 200 gev unless otherwise noted .",
    "we also assume that sleptons are not produced resonancely , considering as an example the scenario with @xmath65 = 184 gev .",
    "we would like to stress that there is a difference ( which was missed in some earlier papers ) in the up and down quark production at lep for the scenario under study .",
    "for bottom - quark production , for example , there is an @xmath26-channel diagram with a sneutrino and @xmath48-channel diagram with an @xmath15-squark ( fig.[diag - lep ] ( a ) ) .",
    "it makes the total cross section dependent not only on @xmath33 but also on @xmath32 values .",
    "the @xmath48-channel diagram has negative interference while the @xmath26-channel diagram has a positive contribution to the total cross section . the total effect from both the diagrams is positive , when @xmath33 and @xmath32 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "at the same time , if only the @xmath48-channel diagram with @xmath1-parity violating vertex is present , as it happens for the up - quark pair production ( fig.[diag - lep ] ( b ) ) , the total effect is negative due to the negative @xmath48-channel diagram interference and the cross section is smaller than the sm one .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[lep ] for the @xmath66-quark pair production ( a ) and the @xmath67-quark pair production ( b ) , where the total cross section as a function of @xmath33 is shown ( @xmath32 is fixed equal to 0.038 ) .",
    "if we take @xmath68 equal to its upper limit ( 0.12 ) , we have a @xmath69 deviation ( @xmath70  pb ) of the total cross section from the standard model for @xmath71  gev lep . in our calculation",
    "we put the value of @xmath33 to that describing the hera data , namely , 0.038 .",
    "if we assume that the b - jet production ratio can be measured with the 1% accuracy , one can establish the limit on @xmath32 about 0.055 ( @xmath33 = 0.038 ) or the limit on the product @xmath72 .",
    "as for the up - quark production , the @xmath48-channel diagrams bring a small negative contribution .",
    "one could expect some contribution of a 200 gev susy particle to the @xmath73 value very accurately measured at lep90 which is equal to @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "but it turns out that for @xmath75  gev the contribution from additional diagrams to the @xmath76 production is only in the 6-th digit .",

    "we would like to look at the case when @xmath32 is small or equal to 0 and the excess in the @xmath76 production is absent .",
    "for example , for @xmath79 the @xmath76 production deviates from the standard model by less than 1% . by a lucky chance we have at present three different colliders with energy of an order of 1 tev : lepton - lepton  lep , lepton - hadron  hera and hadron - hadron  tevatron .",
    "these machines are highly complementary to each other .",
    "we show below that possible failure to find the @xmath1-parity broken susy for our scenario ( if it really exists ) at lep leads to the luck at tevatron in this search and vice versa .",
    "one of the most interesting effects for tevatron revealing the @xmath1-parity violation is the single top production via a slepton decay  @xcite which is resonancely produced in @xmath80 collisions .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the @xmath81 process of single top production are shown in fig .",
    "[ diag - tev ] .    in comparison with our previous paper",
    "we take into account also @xmath82 diagrams of single top production via @xmath1-parity violating vertices : @xmath83-gluon fusion process and @xmath82 process with resonant @xmath83 production .",

    "for comparatively large @xmath32 ( 0.1 - 0.2 ) @xmath83 mainly decays leptonically and the single top production is suppressed . in this case , the deviation in the @xmath76 production could be measured at lep . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath32 is small or even equal to 0 , there is a significant contribution to the single top production via processes mentioned above .    in our calculations",
    "we have fixed @xmath86 and @xmath87 equal to 0.038 and studied the dependence of the single top quark cross section on the values of @xmath68 .",
    "we assume @xmath88=175 gev , use the cteq3 m structure function  @xcite and use the slepton mass as a qcd scale .",

    "+ the process @xmath82 has about 20% contribution to the total rpv cross section and thus should be taken into account .",
    "for example , for @xmath68=0 , the rpv cross section of the @xmath91 process is 0.32 pb , while the rpv cross section of @xmath82 is 0.078 pb .    for our analysis we have used nlo cross sections for the sm single top production using the results of ref.@xcite(@xmath92=175 gev , @xmath93=2 tev ) : @xmath94=@xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "nlo cross section is about 20% higher than the lo one ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "one could expect the same order corrections for the rpv diagrams of the single top quark production .",
    "we used this factor in our analysis .",
    "we can see that the contribution of the rpv processes can be as large as 20% of the total single top production rate .",

    "we include the results of the analysis for single top background processes into our study ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a careful kinematic analysis allows one to suppress significantly the background and makes signal / background ratio equal to 1/2 - 1/3  @xcite which in turn gives the possibility to measure the single top production cross section with the accuracy 19% and 7% for tevatron run2 and run3 , respectively  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the top- and bottom - quark invariant mass distribution analysis will be more sensitive to the rpv single top physics than the total cross section measurement .",

    "the excess of high @xmath0 hera events can be reasonably explained within the supersymmetric standard model with broken @xmath1-parity .",
    "we have suggested some specific scenario for the @xmath1-parity violating susy which has several non - zero couplings . this scenario could be a reasonable explanation of two outstanding fcnc muon events observed by h1 collaboration . at the same time",
    ", one can expect an excess of di- or tri - jet events .",
    "we have checked that the yukawa couplings ( as well as their products ) responsible for processes under study do not exceed their experimental bounds .",
