    "spherical mirrors are widely used , for example in the telescope , to collect light from a distant object and focus it to a point . in practice",
    "this produces not a point but a distribution of light over a finite region in the vicinity of the focus .",
    "analysis of this behavior involves two classic topics in optics  diffraction from a circular aperture and spherical aberrations of the mirror .",
    "typically , the spot size is characterized by a figure of merit such as transverse aberration or root - mean - squared blur radius .",
    "however , in a variety of modern applications , such as data storage , optical tweezers or atom trapping , it is only important to have a narrow central spot even though this may be accompanied by a broad distribution of low intensity in the wings .",
    "for such applications , the analysis requires a new approach , which we develop here .",
    "our own interest is in making an array of atom traps so small that each trap can hold one atom ( or none ) , but not two .",
    "if a second atom is caught , the two interact through a light - induced , inelastic collision and both are kicked out of the trap  an effect known as collisional blockade @xcite .",
    "the ejection of atom pairs occurs promptly provided the spot size of the trapping light is below @xmath1 m @xcite , which is roughly the size of the optical wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "one important application for such traps is the production of single photons on demand @xcite , which can then be used as a powerful resource for quantum cryptography and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "there is a growing literature concerned with strong focusing of light onto single atoms in free space , as a means of achieving efficient atom - light coupling .",
    "a scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite aims to emulate the field radiated from a single atom .",
    "this ideal can be approached using a parabolic reflector to focus light with highly sculpted intensity and phase profiles , but the scheme does not seem suitable for scaling to large arrays of traps . in ref .",
    "@xcite , van enk and kimble considered the simpler case of focusing a uniformly polarized gaussian beam with a lens that imposes a gaussian phase profile .",
    "they were able to achieve a three - dimensional solution for the light field in the region of the focal point .",
    "recently extended this analysis to the case of a spherically converging gaussian wave @xcite , which gave somewhat better coupling .",
    "both of these calculations neglect the aberrations produced by a real imaging system .    in the work presented here ,",
    "we consider focusing by spherical mirrors and we treat the aberrations of the mirror exactly . no high - performance optical system is required and the method offers a simple way to achieve large arrays of traps that are tight enough to produce a strong collisional blockade for alkali atoms .",
    "the idea is to use arrays of hemispherical mirrors , typically with radius of curvature @xmath3 m , that are lithographically etched directly into the surface of a silicon wafer @xcite and covered with a reflective coating .",
    "an incoming plane wave may then be focused to an array of points in a plane near the surface of the wafer , to produce a tight optical trap above each reflector .",
    "once integrated into an atom chip @xcite , these traps may be loaded either directly from a surface magneto - optical trap , or from a magnetic guide with optical molasses added to enable the blockade .    in calculating the characteristics of these microtraps , we found it necessary to consider both the diffraction and the spherical aberrations .",
    "this led us to derive an analytical expression for the distribution of the light near the optic axis of a spherical mirror , which is applicable for wide - angle reflectors and does not seem to have appeared previously in the literature . although the full problem can be solved numerically with a high - performance computer and sufficient patience , our formula has the advantage that it can be evaluated more or less instantaneously . in the rest of this paper , we derive our analytical results , compare them with full numerical simulations , and show that the silicon micro - mirrors are indeed suitable for making sub - wavelength atom traps .",
    "( color online ) light incident along the path @xmath4 is reflected at a point on the spherical mirror surface , then propagates along @xmath5 to the point of observation ( cartesian coordinates @xmath6 ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : geometry ] shows a schematic micro - mirror with radius of curvature @xmath7 centered on the point @xmath8 , illuminated by a point source at position @xmath9 .",
    "we take @xmath10 , so that the incident light is collimated and parallel to the optic axis .",
    "if the light were incident on a simple circular hole of radius @xmath11 , the amplitude of the output in the far field propagating at angle @xmath12 to the optic axis would be given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wavenumber @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the bessel function @xcite .",
    "as a starting point , let us consider ideal imaging that satisfies the abbe sine criterion and focuses incident collimated light onto the plane @xmath17 . in the image plane ,",
    "the rays incident at angle @xmath12 have an off - axis displacement of @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the focal plane has a radius at half - maximum intensity , @xmath19 , given by    @xmath20    here , we have neglected the difference between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , since we are only interested in apertures having @xmath23 , which produce small angles of diffraction .",
    "the aperture size is conveniently expressed by the dimensionless ratio @xmath24 . for a spherical mirror , @xmath25 , but for imaging that satisfies the abbe criterion",
    ", the numerical aperture reaches its maximum value of 1 when the input radius is equal to the focal length ( see @xcite ,  4.5.1 ) .",
    "thus the maximum aperture for our ideal optic is @xmath26 , giving a minimum spot size according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffraction ] ) of @xmath27 . throughout this paper",
    "we use the phrase `` spot size '' to mean radius at half - maximum intensity .",
    "this result captures the essence of the diffraction but does not treat the focusing correctly since a large - aperture mirror exhibits numerous orders of aberration .",
    "we therefore adopt kirchhoff s diffraction theory in order to estimate the spot size more accurately .",
    "the incident light is assumed to illuminate the mirror surface uniformly .",
    "secondary waves then radiate to the observation point @xmath28 , illustrated in fig.[fig : geometry ] . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the incoming beam and reflections from the flat part of the mirror because we are interested in the focal region , where the reflected intensity is relatively high .",

    "the scalar @xmath32 is the modulus of the vector @xmath33 shown in fig.[fig : geometry ] , and similarly for @xmath34 .",
    "the free - space green function for the light field is , and @xmath35 denotes the gradient taken along @xmath36 , the normal to the mirror surface . since the observation points of interest will be many wavelengths away from the mirror surface , we can assume that @xmath37 and therefore @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath42 .",

    "since the light is to be tightly focused near the optical axis , we need only consider observation points where .",
    "expanding @xmath34 to first order around @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 returning now to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kirchhoff2 ] ) , we eliminate the two cosines and replace @xmath34 by @xmath53 everywhere except in the exponent .",
    "there , we keep the @xmath54 term as well and integrate over @xmath55 , giving @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this is our main result .    in the limit of small mirror aperture , _",
    "i.e. _ small @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath66 thus the radius at half - maximum intensity is @xmath67 evaluated in the focal plane @xmath68 , this duplicates eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffraction ] ) , as one would expect in this limit where the mirror becomes an ideal thin element .",
    "the position of maximum intensity lies on the @xmath69 axis , but not at @xmath68 . in this small aperture limit",
    ", the intensity increases as the mirror is approached because the spreading of the light due to diffraction dominates over the focusing due to the curvature of the mirror surface : this is the limit of small fresnel number .",

    "these all have fresnel numbers greater than unity and exhibit peaks close to @xmath74 . at first , as the aperture is increased , the light becomes more concentrated axially , giving rise to a narrower peak at @xmath75 ( middle ) than at @xmath71 ( bottom ) . with even larger aperture",
    ", however , secondary structure appears on the large-@xmath76 side of the main peak .",
    "this is due to spherical aberration , _",
    "i.e. _ to rays that are incident increasingly far from the axis and therefore cross the axis at larger values of @xmath76 after reflection . in order to test these detailed predictions of eq .",

    "fig : meep ] .",
    "these are due mainly to interference between the incident plane - wave and the field reflected from the mirror .",
    "the same effect can be captured qualitatively by adding the incident field to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullform ] ) .",
    "such an intensity distribution could be useful for making a tightly confining optical lattice but would not be chosen when a single , well - defined atom trap is required . the full numerical solution with medium aperture , shown in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : meep ] and in the central curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts](b ) , agrees very well with our analytical result .",
    "the interference fringes are much less evident here , as the amplitude of the reflected wave is much higher .",
    "there is also good agreement in the case of the largest aperture , except that the subsidiary structure due to spherical aberration is slightly smaller in the exact solution .",
    "this is because the electric fields of rays coming from the outer parts of the mirror are significantly inclined and should be added as vectors , whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullform ] ) , based on the scalar wave equation , adds them as scalars .",
    "we conclude that an aperture @xmath80 is a good choice for achieving a single optical dipole trap with tight axial confinement , and that this is well described by eq .",

    "( [ eq : fullform ] ) , shows that although the spot size is somewhat increased by the mirror depth and the aberrations neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffraction ] ) , it is still well below @xmath84 .",
    "we calculate this width not in the focal plane @xmath68 but at the value of @xmath76 where the on - axis intensity is maximum , since that is where the optical dipole trap is actually formed .",
    "the dots show the widths obtained from the full numerical integration of maxwell s equations . near @xmath71 , these agree closely with the widths derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullform ] ) , but as the aperture opens , we see that the full solution gives a slightly larger spot size .",

    "( [ eq : fullform ] ) , with spot size @xmath85 .",
    "concerning the vector nature of the field , this is transverse on axis and follows the polarisation of the input light . off axis",

    "this ratio grows from zero on axis to @xmath72 at @xmath91 .",

    "once again , eq .  ( [ eq : fullform ] ) provides a very good approximation to the exact solution .",
    "finally we note that although all the simulations shown in this article have taken @xmath70 , this is not a critical requirement .",
    "when @xmath7 is increased from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , the spot volume obtained by numerical integration for @xmath75 grows by less than @xmath102 , though of course the constraint on surface quality of the mirror becomes more demanding .",
    "in conclusion we have derived a useful formula for the field distribution in front of a spherical mirror illuminated by a plane wave . using this result",
    "we have shown that a modern micro - fabricated mirror of order @xmath103-@xmath104 in size can produce either a tight optical lattice , or a single spot with little additional structure , having a radius at half - maximum intensity well below @xmath84 .",
    "the fabrication method makes it straightforward to scale this up to a large number of spots in any desired array .",
    "this method is therefore suitable for building atom traps for applications in quantum information processing , or for any other application where tight focusing is required and the low - intensity wings of the spot are unimportant .",
