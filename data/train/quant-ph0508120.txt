    "one of the most surprising aspects of quantum theory is its ability to yield _ non - local _ correlations , which can not be explained by any local hidden - variable model @xcite .",

    "an interesting question is whether quantum theory yields the maximal amount of non - local correlations consistent with causality .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , it has been shown that this is not the case @xcite , and that it is possible to construct a theoretical system which does not allow superluminal signalling , yet which is more non - local than quantum theory .",
    "such a system can achieve the maximal possible value of 4 for the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh)@xcite expression , compared to @xmath0 for quantum theory ( the cirelson bound @xcite ) , or 2 for any local hidden variable model .    recently , the idea of non - local correlations stronger than those attainable in quantum theory has received considerable interest : van dam @xcite has shown that they allow any bipartite communication complexity problem to be solved with only one bit of communication . wolf and wullschleger @xcite , buhrman et al .",

    ", we consider an abstract correlation - system composed of a number of black boxes ( subsystems ) held by different parties , each of which has an input ( their measurement setting ) and an output ( their measurement result ) .",
    "we represent the combined state of all of the boxes by the conditional probability distribution for their outputs given their inputs .",
    "the non - local correlations achievable using correlated box - states are analogous to those achievable using entangled quantum states .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see what properties of entanglement have analogues for these more general non - local correlations .",
    "a property which does have such an analogue can be viewed as a general property of non - local correlations ( and therefore not specifically quantum ) , while a property without such an analogue is specific to quantum theory , and therefore may reveal why quantum theory has the particular form that it does .    in this paper , we consider the analogue of entanglement - swapping for correlated box states , in which non - local correlations between alice and bob , and between bob and charlie , are used to generate non - local correlations between alice and charlie .    in an attempt to achieve this",
    ", we consider the possibility of introducing a new class of objects called ` couplers ' , which can perform an analogue for boxes of measurements with entangled eigenstates in quantum theory .",
    "we first consider a natural potential coupler in detail , showing how it fails to provide a consistent solution , then proceed to develop a general framework with which to explore other possibilities .",
    "surprisingly , we find that no couplers exist for two binary - input / binary - output boxes , and hence that there is no analogue of entanglement - swapping for such boxes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii we define general correlated box states , and in section iii we briefly review quantum entanglement - swapping . in section iv , we attempt to achieve an analogue of entanglement - swapping for non - locally correlated boxes . however , we show this is impossible to achieve using a sequence of conditional measurements on individual boxes . in section",
    "v we introduce couplers , and consider both general and specific cases , and in section vi we present our conclusions .",
    "consider a general multi - partite system composed of @xmath1 correlated subsystems , each of which can be moved about freely .",
    "we represent each subsystem by a black - box , which has an input ( corresponding to the choice of which measurement to perform on that subsystem ) , and an output ( which is the result of the chosen measurement ) .",
    "we will assume that only one input can be made to each box , and that the corresponding output is obtained immediately ( without having to wait for messages to travel between the boxes ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the probability of obtaining a given set of outputs @xmath2 from a system of boxes depends only on the inputs @xmath3 which are made to those boxes , and not on the timings of those inputs ( which would be reference - frame dependent ) .",
    "the _ state _ of the boxes can therefore be represented completely by a conditional probability distribution @xmath4 .",
    "as the boxes can be moved to any point in space , and their inputs applied at any time , the ability to transmit information using them would allow superluminal signalling .",
    "we therefore require that the boxes obey the following no - signalling condition : for all partitions of the boxes into two disjoint sets held by a sender ( with inputs @xmath5 and outputs @xmath6 ) and a receiver ( with inputs @xmath7 and outputs @xmath8 ) , there exists a probability distribution @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "this ensures that when the sender and receiver are separated ( and therefore the receiver does not know @xmath6 ) the receiver can learn nothing about the sender s inputs @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore impossible for the sender to transmit information to the receiver using the boxes .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath9 plays an analogous role to the reduced density matrix of the receiver s subsystems in quantum theory satisfies the no - signalling condition , @xmath12 will also satisfy it .",
    "@xmath13 is therefore an allowed correlated box state . ] , providing the probabilities for his boxes outputs when considered independently .",
    "we now consider in detail the simplest case admitting non - local correlations , which is that of two binary - input / binary - output boxes .",
    "taking @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the two box state is represented by the probability distribution @xmath16 , where all of the inputs and outputs are binary variables .",

    "@xcite , and was found to form an 8-dimensional convex polytope with 24 vertices . of these , 16 vertices represent the deterministic ` local ' states , for which alice and bob s outputs are a function of their inputs alone , and hence their boxes are uncorrelated .",
    "these are the analogues of quantum mechanical product states .",
    "the probability distributions for these extremal local states are : @xmath20 where @xmath21 parameterize the 16 states and @xmath22 denotes addition modulo 2 .",
    "a state will lie within the convex polytope @xmath23 formed by these 16 vertices if and only if it can be simulated by local operations and shared randomness , and we will refer to any such state as a local state .",
    "the remaining 8 vertices represent non - local states ( lying outside @xmath23 ) , with probability distributions given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "each non - local extremal state maximally violates a chsh - type inequality ( achieving a greater value than is attainable in quantum theory ) , and can not be simulated with local operations and shared randomness .",

    ", we will refer to all of the non - local extremal states as pr - states @xcite , although for simplicity we will usually consider the standard pr - state @xmath26 , for which @xmath27 .",
    "in the quantum case , the simplest example of entanglement - swapping is as follows .",
    "suppose that alice shares a singlet state with bob , and bob shares a singlet state with charlie , such that their combined state is @xmath28 in this state , alice s and charlie s qubits are completely uncorrelated .",
    "however , expanding the bipartite states held by bob , and by alice and charlie , in the bell basis of maximally entangled states , @xmath29 yields @xmath30 a measurement by bob in the bell - basis @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 will therefore leave alice and charlie sharing the same maximally - entangled state as bob , which contains strong non - local correlations .",
    "alice and charlie will know which entangled state they share as soon as bob tells them his measurement result .",
    "if they wish , they can transform this state into a specific maximally entangled state ( eg .",
    "@xmath35 ) by performing a local operation on one subsystem .",
    "we now consider the analogue of entanglement swapping for generalised non - local correlations .",
    "consider first the simplest case in which bob shares a standard pr - state @xmath36 with alice and an identical pr - state @xmath37 with charlie .",
    "the actions available to bob are somewhat limited .",
    "the most general thing that he can do is to apply an input to one of his two boxes , and then use the output of this box in deciding which input to apply to his second box .",
    "this can be represented by a circuit diagram incorporating the two boxes ( an example of which is shown in figure [ wiring_fig ] ) .",
    "= 3truein    can bob introduce non - local correlations between alice and charlie ?",
    "without loss of generality , suppose that bob first inputs @xmath38 into his box which is correlated with alice s box , obtaining an output @xmath39 .",
    "he can then input a general function @xmath40 of @xmath39 into his box which is correlated with charlie s box , obtaining the output @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 ) .",
    "an example circuit for @xmath43 is shown in figure [ wiring_fig ] .",
    "regardless of the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the probability @xmath46 of bob obtaining the two - bit output set @xmath47 will be 1/4 , as @xmath48 .    after completing this procedure",
    ", bob announces his outputs @xmath39 and @xmath41 ( and his strategy choices @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) to alice and charlie .",
    "the probability distribution for their inputs and outputs is then given by @xmath49 which is the probability distribution corresponding to the _ local _ state @xmath50 . by applying inputs to his boxes , bob has therefore _ collapsed _ the state of the remaining two boxes to an extremal local state .",
    "this is analogous to the collapse of entangled quantum states after a measurement by one party .    by switching the ordering of his inputs , selecting his strategy choices ( @xmath51 ) probabilistically , restricting the information he gives to alice and charlie , or sometimes announcing that the process has ` failed '",
    ", bob can cause the state shared by alice and charlie to be any probabilistic combination of the extremal local states ( and hence any local state ) .",
    "however , there is no way that bob can introduce _ non - local _ correlations between alice and charlie , since in each particular instance of the procedure alice and charlie share a local state .",
    "the above result extends to the general case in which bob shares any correlated box state with alice , and any correlated box state with charlie , but has no boxes which are correlated with both parties .",
    "in this case , the initial state of all of the boxes will be a product of two separate states : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 , represent the inputs and outputs of alice s and charlie s boxes respectively , and bob s boxes are partitioned into two sets ( with inputs @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and outputs @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ) depending on whether they are correlated with alice or with charlie .",
    "the most general strategy bob can adopt is to choose which of his boxes to apply an input to , and what input to apply to that box , dependent on all earlier outputs .",
    "using such an approach , he will generate a particular set of inputs and outputs with probability @xmath61 .",
    "as bob applies all of his inputs first , @xmath61 can be calculated without reference to alice and charlie , and will depend only on the reduced state of bob s boxes ( @xmath62 ) , and his particular choice of strategy .",
    "unfortunately , once all of bob s inputs and outputs are known , the state @xmath63 collapses to @xmath64 , which is a local probabilistic operation for alice , and similarly @xmath65 collapses to @xmath66 . for a given set of inputs and outputs for bob",
    ", the final state of alice s and charlie s boxes will therefore take the form @xmath67 which is manifestly local between alice and charlie .",
    "regardless of his strategy , it is therefore impossible for bob to generate non - local correlations between alice and charlie , even with some small probability .",
    "as we have seen above , it seems impossible for bob to generate non - local correlations between alice and charlie .",
    "however we know from quantum theory that such ` entanglement - swapping ' is possible .",
    "why then , can generalised non - locality not be swapped ? pondering this question , one soon realises that the set of actions considered above is far too restrictive . if we were to consider analagous procedures in the case of quantum entanglement - swapping ( as introduced in section [ quantum - sec ] ) , they would correspond to bob making an individual measurement on one of his two qubits , and then performing a measurement on his second qubit in a basis determined by his first measurement result .",
    "whatever bob s results , such a procedure would collapse the state of alice s and charlie s qubits into a local product state , and hence can not achieve entanglement - swapping .    in quantum theory ,",
    "entanglement swapping is achieved by a _",
    "measurement on both of the subsystems held by bob ( i.e. a measurement with entangled eigenstates ) .",
    "it is this coupling of two subsystems which we need to incorporate into our box model .",
    "we therefore need to introduce a new device called a ` coupler ' , which is connected to the input and output channels of the two boxes held by bob , and produces a single output @xmath68 ( as shown in figure [ coupler_fig ] ) .",
    "this output can be interpreted as the result of a joint measurement on bob s two subsystems ..    = 3truein    consider first the simple situation in which alice and bob share a standard pr - state with probability distribution @xmath69 , and bob and charlie share a standard pr - state with probability distribution @xmath70 .",
    "we would like our coupler to generate , with some probability , a standard pr - state @xmath71 between alice and charlie .",
    "as in the quantum case , such a process can not be achieved with certainty , as otherwise if alice and charlie brought their boxes together bob could signal superluminally to them by applying the coupler ( thereby changing alice and charlie s joint probability distribution from @xmath72 to @xmath73 in this case , it is easy to see that each party s output is random , and the outcomes of any two parties are uncorrelated ( in particular @xmath74 as required ) . only by learning all three outputs is any information about the inputs obtained , and the coupler can not therefore be used for signalling .",
    "however , after bob has applied the coupler and obtained an output @xmath68 ( with probability @xmath75 , alice and charlie will share the maximally non - local state @xmath76 .",
    "if bob then announces his measurement result , and one party performs the local operation @xmath77 on their output ( i.e. applies a not - gate if @xmath78 ) , alice and charlie will be left with the standard pr - state @xmath71 as desired .",
    "this procedure , in which alice or charlie must perform a local correction conditional on bob s measurement result in order to obtain a desired final state , is strongly analogous to the quantum case .",
    "it therefore seems that , by enlarging the class of generalised non - local objects to include couplers in addition to boxes , we achieve generalised non - locality swapping .",
    "this is in complete analogy with quantum mechanics where in addition to entangled states , we consider measurements with entangled eigenstates .",
    "however , as we will show below , the above coupler actually can not exist .      before allowing the coupler defined in the last section in our model ,",
    "it is important to check that it gives consistent results when applied to all possible states . to investigate this",
    ", we consider the case in which alice and charlie apply inputs to their boxes before bob applies the coupler to his boxes .",
    "if they initially share standard pr - states as before , their inputs and outputs will obey the relations @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "after alice and charlie have applied inputs to and obtained outputs from their boxes , the outputs of bob s two boxes will be given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the probability distribution for bob s two boxes has therefore collapsed to the extremal local state @xmath83 .",
    "suppose that bob then applies a coupler to his two boxes . as is the case for the original box inputs , we assume that the final probability distribution given by ( [ coupler_prob ] ) will be the same regardless of the timings of alice and charlie s inputs , and of bob s application of the coupler . in order to satisfy ( [ coupler_prob ] ) , it is therefore necessary that the probability distribution @xmath84 for the coupler output when it is applied to two boxes in the state @xmath85 be given by @xmath86    similarly , in the case in which alice and charlie measure first , all possible pairs of initial bipartite extremal - states shared by alice - bob and bob - charlie ( e.g. @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) will collapse to a local extremal state for bob s two boxes ( e.g. @xmath89 for the example given ) .",
    "if we assume that the coupler always acts in the same way when applied to the same state of bob s two boxes , then equation ( [ local_box_eqn ] ) can be used deduce the action of the coupler on all initial states of this type .",
    "furthermore , if we assume linearity in the initial probability distributions ( which is necessary to ensure no - signalling - as shown in section [ dynamics_sec ] ) , then we can deduce the action of the coupler when applied between any two general states by expanding them as convex mixtures of extremal states and using the above results .",
    "it appears that such a coupler is consistent .",
    "however , suppose that in addition to bob applying a coupler to his two boxes , alice and charlie bring their two boxes together and apply a coupler between them ( as shown in figure [ looped_coupler_fig ] ) .",
    "if alice and charlie s coupler is applied first and they obtain output @xmath90 , bob s two boxes will collapse to the pr - state @xmath91 ( from equation ( [ coupler_prob ] ) ) . in order to obtain bob s output",
    ", we must therefore determine the coupler output when it is applied to two boxes in an pr - state , rather than to two boxes in a local state as we have considered so far .",
    "= 3.4truein    to investigate this case , we consider a particular non - extremal state @xmath92 . as for mixed states in quantum theory , every non - extremal box state can be obtained in an infinite number of different ways by taking probabilistic mixtures of other box states @xcite .",
    "we require that the coupler act in the same way regardless of how the probability distribution @xmath92 was prepared ( i.e. it should be decomposition invariant ) .",
    "the state @xmath92 has two particular decompositions of interest .",
    "the first is obtained by adding random noise to the standard pr - state until it becomes local , and the second of which is its explicit decomposition in terms of local extremal states : @xmath93    using ( [ local_box_eqn ] ) , it is easy to see that the eight local states in the decomposition ( [ box_decomp2 ] ) of @xmath94 all give @xmath95 when the coupler is applied to them .",
    "applying linearity , the coupler must therefore give @xmath95 with certainty when applied to the state @xmath96 .",
    "however , it is also evident from ( [ local_box_eqn ] ) that the coupler will give @xmath78 when applied to the local states @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which appear in the decomposition ( [ box_decomp1 ] ) with probability 1/8 each . given any non - negative probability distribution @xmath99 for the coupler output when applied to a standard pr - state",
    ", the probability of obtaining @xmath78 from the state @xmath92 can not therefore be less than @xmath100 .",
    "the results obtained from the two decompositions of latexmath:[$p^b ( b_1 b_2    physical probability distribution @xmath99 . only the non - physical distribution @xmath102 which is not a valid probability distribution as it does not satisfy @xmath103 , could recover the desired decomposition invariance .",
    "because of this inconsistency , the ` naive ' coupler defined by ( [ coupler_prob ] ) is not an allowable object within the correlated - box model .",
    "however , this raises the question of whether other any coupler exists which can achieve an analogue of entanglement swapping .      to generalise the approach of the previous section",
    ", we will consider a coupler as any device which acts on @xmath104 boxes with a given range of inputs and outputs and produces a single output @xmath68 ( also with a given range ) , and which can not be implemented by applying a sequence of individual inputs to the coupled boxes ( as in section [ non - locality1 ] ) . in this context ,",
    "the coupler considered in the last section , were it to have proved consistent , would have been an @xmath105 coupler , with all inputs and outputs being binary .",
    "we consider a general set of @xmath1 boxes divided between the person who is going to apply the coupler ( who we call bob ) and the rest of the world ( which we call alice ) . in the most general case , bob has the @xmath104 boxes to which the coupler is to be applied ( with inputs @xmath106 and outputs @xmath107 ) , and an additional set of @xmath108 boxes ( with inputs @xmath109 and outputs @xmath110 ) .",

    "the coupler then performs the transformation : @xmath117    following the discussion in the previous section , we impose four natural constraints on the coupler s action :    1 .   * universality * : the coupler must be applicable to any set of @xmath104 boxes with the appropriate range of inputs / outputs , that are part of any no - signalling correlated box state .",
    "note that this is the condition for which the coupler proposed in the last section fails , as it can not be applied to two boxes in a pr - state .",
    "[ cond_u ] 2 .",
    "* completeness * : a correlated box state is completely specified by the conditional probability distribution for its outputs given its inputs . to respect this completeness , we require that the probability distribution @xmath118 obtained by applying the coupler to a set of boxes depends only on the probability distribution @xmath119 of those boxes to which it is applied . + the same probability distribution @xmath120 can be obtained from many different mixtures of extremal states ( as in ( [ box_decomp1 ] ) and ( [ box_decomp2 ] ) ) , or by collapsing a larger state by applying inputs to some of the boxes . this requirement ensures that the coupler gives the same outcome in all of these cases .",
    "it also ensures that the results do not depend on the time at which the coupler is applied , just as the timings of standard inputs do not affect the boxes outputs.[cond_nhv ] 3 .   * no signalling * : [ cond_ns ] the coupler must not allow signalling .",
    "note that the most powerful situations for sending and receiving information are when all of the boxes that are not held by bob ( i.e. alice s boxes ) are gathered in the same place , and hence all of their inputs and outputs are immediately accessible .",
    "we must rule out two possibilities : 1 .   signalling from alice to bob :",
    "we require that bob can not learn anything about alice s inputs from his coupler and box outputs .",

    ": the coupler must represent something that was not previously possible .",
    "as discussed in section [ non - locality1 ] , the most general strategy that bob can adopt _ without _ a coupler is to apply a sequence of individual inputs to his boxes , where later inputs may depend on earlier outputs .",
    "a coupler can not be simulated using such a procedure ( with @xmath68 given by some function of the outputs ) .",
    "we will now show that constraints ( i)-(iii ) allow only those couplers which act as linear maps on the reduced state of bob s boxes .",

    "is fixed by equation ( [ bipartite_prob_eqn2 ] ) to be @xmath164 . given any @xmath165 satisfying ( [ bipartite_prob_eqn1 ] ) it is always possible to find a @xmath166 satisfying ( [ bipartite_prob_eqn1 ] ) and ( [ bipartite_prob_eqn2 ] ) by defining @xmath167 ) , as this gives @xmath168 as all other choices of @xmath166 must give the same values for @xmath163 , they are all equivalent .",
    "hence a coupler is completely specified by the 16 parameters @xmath169 .",
    "the class @xmath170 of @xmath165 distributions satisfying the universality constraint are those which are consistent with the 48 linear inequalities that result from applying equation ( [ bipartite_prob_eqn1 ] ) to the 16 extremal local states @xmath171 and 8 extremal non - local states @xmath172 .",
    "this approach yields a convex polytope for @xmath170 . using the program lrs , written by d.avis . ]",
    "it has 9 dimensions and 82 vertices , as well as 7 linearities which have no effect on the final probability distributions ( and therefore define an equivalence class of @xmath165 which would correspond to the same coupler ) .",
    "each point in the polytope @xmath170 corresponds to a different potential coupler , with the only remaining constraint on them being that of non - triviality .",
    "the 82 extremal points of @xmath170 can all be expressed by @xmath173 , and can therefore be characterised by the values of @xmath174 for which @xmath175 ( with all other coefficients being zero ) .",
    "coupler_table ] gives a representation of each extremal @xmath176 distribution in this way .",
    "for simplicity , these extremal points have been divided into 5 classes , each of which are paramaterised by a subset of the binary coefficients @xmath177 .",

    "the potential couplers are divided into 5 classes , with the members in each class parameterized by @xmath178 .",
    "the second column shows the number of different potential couplers in each class .",
    "[ coupler_table ] [ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]     perhaps surprisingly , all 82 extremal points of @xmath170 _ fail _ to satisfy the non - triviality constraint ( iv ) . each of these potential couplers can be generated by applying wiring and logic gates to bob s two boxes ( indeed , they represent every inequivalent wiring of this type ) .",
    "a circuit diagram for the standard potential coupler ( @xmath179 ) in each class is shown in figure [ wiringall_fig ] .",
    "the remaining potential couplers in each class can be obtained by adding not - gates to some or all of the wires in the standard circuit , and/or by swapping the positions of bob s two boxes .",
    "= 3.5truein    as every potential coupler in @xmath170 can be realised by a probabilistic mixture of these extremal potential couplers ( and hence a probabilistic wiring strategy for bob ) , all of them fail to satisfy the non - triviality constraint .",
    "there are therefore no binary - output couplers for two binary - input / binary - output boxes .",
    "although we have so far only considered couplers with a binary output @xmath68 , this result will hold for couplers with any range of outputs @xmath180 .",
    "if for some output @xmath181 a coupler characterised by @xmath176 existed , we could always construct a binary - output coupler characterised by @xmath182 which output @xmath95 if @xmath181 and @xmath78 when @xmath183 , by taking @xmath184 as we have shown that there are no binary - output couplers , there must also be no couplers with a larger output range .",
    "we can therefore conclude that , in the case of two binary - input / binary - output boxes , _ no couplers exist_. as discussed in section [ non - locality1 ] , this means that it is impossible to implement an analogue of entanglement swapping for pr - states .",
    "considering correlation experiments in terms of abstract black - boxes allows us to separate the information - theoretic content of non - locality from the underlying physical detail",
    ".    for correlations between a set of time - independent measurements , no - signalling box - states represent every possibility which is consistent with relativity .",
    "however , quantum theory also allows the possibility of entanglement - swapping , in which non - local correlations can be introduced between two subsystems which are initially uncorrelated , by performing a joint measurement on two subsystems with which they are entangled and announcing the result .",
    "we have shown that it is impossible to achieve an analogue of entanglement - swapping between two bipartite non - local box - states using a sequence of individual ( yet conditional ) box inputs .",
    "this led us to introduce the concept of couplers , which are an analogue of measurements with entangled eigenstates in quantum theory .",
    "under very general assumptions of universality ( a coupler can be applied to any box with the appropriate inputs and outputs ) , completeness ( a coupler acts identically on states with the same probability distribution ) , and no - signalling , we found that any allowed coupler must be linear .",
    "we then proceeded to investigate the allowed couplers which act on two binary - input / binary - output boxes .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , we found that no couplers of this type exist .",
    "in particular , this means that when alice and bob share a pr - state , and bob and charlie share a pr - state , there is no way that bob can generate any non - local correlations between alice and charlie .",
    "as we have so far only explicitly considered couplers acting on binary - input / binary - output boxes , it would be interesting to see if couplers exist in more general cases . of particular interest",
    "would be the class of couplers which act on two ternary - input / binary - output boxes and generate a two - bit output .",
    "as qubit states can be characterised by measurements of the three pauli matrices , and bell measurements have four outputs , this would enable a closer analogy between the quantum case and that of general correlated box states .",
    "couplers also correspond to a first step into the dynamics of correlated boxes , transforming @xmath104 boxes in the initial state into one effective box ( with output @xmath68 and no input ) in the final state .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise the constraints introduced for couplers to apply to more general dynamical processes ( taking @xmath104 boxes in the initial state to @xmath108 boxes in the final state ) .",
    "this opens the possibility for deeper studies of the dynamics of correlated boxes ( as desired in @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained so far for couplers suggest that by allowing stronger non - local correlations than are attainable in quantum theory , the dynamics of the model actually become weaker ( to the extent that no couplers exist for two binary - input / binary - output boxes ) .",
    "this offers a possible insight into why such super - strong correlations are not attainable in nature : in order to allow richer dynamics .",
