    "entanglement of quantum states is the most non - classical feature of quantum systems and one of the key resources in quantum information theory @xcite . in real quantum systems , inevitable interactions with surrounding environment",
    "may lead to decoherence resulting in degradation of entanglement . since entanglement once it has been lost , can not be restored by local operations ,",
    "it is important to understand the process of disentanglement to control the effects of noise and to preserve as much entanglement as possible . the main motivation of the investigations presented in the paper is to study the possibility of the preservation of entanglement in the model of two two - level atoms interacting with environment with maximal noise ( the case of thermal noise will be discussed elsewhere ) . in the markovian approximation ,",
    "the influence of that kind of environment on a single atom is described by dynamical semi - group with lindblad generator in which the transition rates from ground state to excited state of the atom and vice versa , are equal to decay rate @xmath0 .",
    "this noisy dynamics is related to the following limiting procedure : temperature of thermal reservoir tends to infinity , whereas the coupling strength goes to zero @xcite . on the other hand , the collective properties of two - atomic systems can alter the decay process compared with the single atom .",
    "it was already shown by dicke @xcite in the case of spontaneous emission and environment in the vacuum state that there are states with enhanced emission rates ( superradiant states ) and such that the emission rate is reduced ( subradiant states ) . in the latter case ,",
    "two - atom system can decohere slower compared with individual atoms and some amount of initial entanglement can be preserved or even created by the indirect interaction between atoms @xcite .    in the model discussed in the paper , the collective dynamics of two atoms",
    "is described by damping rate @xmath1 which depends on interatomic distance .",
    "when the atoms are separated by a large distance , one can assume that they are located inside two independent environments and @xmath2 .",
    "in that case , the noisy dynamics brings all initial states into unique asymptotic state which is maximally mixed .",
    "moreover , all entangled states disentangle in finite time @xcite .",
    "when atoms are confined in a region smaller than the radiation wave length , the collective damping rate is close to the decay rate , so we can use the approximation @xmath3 . in that case , similarly as in the dicke model , the antisymmetric state ( singlet state ) is decoupled from the environment and therefore is stable .",
    "this is the main physical reason why entanglement can be preserved in spite of the the influence of noisy environment .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in robust entanglement , so we study long time ( asymptotic ) behaviour of dynamical semi - group .",
    "we also not discuss here the case of arbitrary separation of atoms , since in that case all states disentangle asymptotically .",
    "small distance separation modeled by the condition @xmath3 , leads to the interesting semi - group which is not ergodic : asymptotic stationary states depend on initial conditions and can be parametrized by fidelity of initial state with respect to singlet state .",
    "we show that some of these asymptotic states are entangled .",
    "they belong to the important class of werner states @xcite .",
    "in particular , we prove that if fidelity is greater then @xmath4 , the asymptotic werner state is entangled .",
    "so collective damping can produce correlations between atoms which partially overcome the effect of decoherence , but in contrast to the zero temperature case @xcite , this process can not create entanglement .",
    "our noisy dynamics has also another remarkable property : there are initial entangled states for which entanglement is preserved during the evolution , although the process of decoherence takes place , resulting in decreasing of purity . as we prove",
    ", asymptotic entanglement depends only on the overlap of the initial state with singlet state but not on its entanglement .",
    "so initial states with the same entanglement can behave differently with respect to the noise .",
    "this opens the possibility of protecting some entanglement of the initial state by performing local operations ( which do not change entanglement ) to maximize its overlap with singlet state .",
    "when the interatomic separation is small , coupling by the dipol  dipol interaction plays a significant role .",
    "it causes the entanglement between two atoms to oscillate in time , so for some period initial entanglement may even increase , but the noise decreases the amplitude of these oscillations , and asymptotically its contribution to the preservation of entanglement vanishes .",
    "since we mainly study here the role of noise in the time evolution of entanglement , we are not discussing in detail the interesting problem of the influence of dipol  dipol coupling on this evolution .",
    "similarly , the experimental side of the problems studied here is beyond the scope of the present paper , where we investigate the theoretical model of the compound system interacting with maximally noised environment .",
    "time evolution of a density matrix of two two - level atoms @xmath5 and @xmath6 interacting with a noisy environment of the type discussed in the introduction , can be described by the following master equation @xmath7\\,+\\,l_{{\\mathrm{n}}}{\\rho}\\label{mastereq}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 and we identify ground state @xmath11 and excited state @xmath12 of the atom @xmath5 or @xmath6 with vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath15 . in the hamiltonian term ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath16 is the frequency of the transition @xmath17 and @xmath18 describes interatomic coupling by the dipol - dipol interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "noisy dynamics is given by the generator ( [ gener ] ) with @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the equality ( [ rateaa ] ) , @xmath0 is a decay rate of individual atom .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 in the equality ( [ rateab ] ) describes the collective damping rate of two atoms interacting with a noisy environment . in our model",
    ", @xmath1 satisfies @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the function of the distance @xmath23 between atoms such that @xmath24 when @xmath25 .",

    "one can work in the basis of so called collective states in the hilbert space @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath28 then this basis containing excited state , ground state and symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the product states , is defined as follows @xmath29 in the basis of collective states , two  atom system can be treated as single four  level system with ground state @xmath30 , excited state @xmath31 and two intermediate states @xmath32 and @xmath33 . from ( [ mastereq ] )",

    "observe also that four  level system prepared in symmetric state @xmath32 decays with enhanced rate @xmath37 , whereas antisymmetric initial state @xmath33 leads to reduced rate @xmath38 .",
    "when two atoms are confined in a region smaller than the resonant wave length , we can put @xmath3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) so antisymmetric state @xmath33 is completely decoupled from the environment and is decoherence  free state of the two  atomic system .",
    "one can also check that equations ( [ eq ] ) describe two types of time evolution of the system , depending on the relations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath39 , there is a unique asymptotic state of the system , which is maximally mixed state @xmath40 . in that case",
    "the relaxation process brings all initial states of two atoms into the state with maximal entropy . in the present note",
    ", we analyse the case when @xmath3 and show that asymptotic stationary states depend on initial conditions and can be parametrized by matrix elements @xmath41 of the initial states .",
    "when @xmath3 , equations ( [ eq ] ) simplify considerably and one can check that solutions of ( [ eq5 ] )  ( [ eq10 ] ) asymptotically vanish .",
