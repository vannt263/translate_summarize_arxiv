    "during the last years , theoretical and instrumental developments in physics have led to an unprecedented level of control over atomic and nanoscale systems .",
    "striking examples include the manipulation of single quantum systems such as laser cooled trapped ions @xcite , and the advances on fabrication , characterization and application of nano- mesoscale devices such as electromechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "isolated single quantum systems are the natural choice when quantum logic is involved @xcite and the nanoscale devices are recognizedly known as very sensitive weak signal detectors @xcite .",
    "the emerging field of quantum technology takes advantage of the strong and different features of these two kind of systems by combining them together in a single setup @xcite .",
    "the goal of quantum technology is to explore legitimate quantum resources such as entanglement to perform tasks with no classical analogue and to enforce it on nano- mesoscopic systems which can be integrated , for instance , on a chip for massive use . in order to achieve that , one very attractive route consists of cooling the nems down to its ground state @xcite and then enforce on it a legitimate quantum behavior by coupling it to well controlled small quantum systems .",
    "for example , the coupling of qubits to these mechanical nanoresonators allows one to generate superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable states in the motion @xcite .",
    "these states may be useful to study the so called quantum - to - classical transition and the phenomenon of decoherence happening in nano- and mesosystems .",
    "this is a natural follow up to the studies started in the scope of cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "potential applications of nemss include several uses as a sensitive detector .",
    "detection of single spins @xcite and spin - spin interactions @xcite as well as single molecule mass spectrometry @xcite offer new possibilities in chemical imaging and characterization .",
    "for instance , nitrogen - vacancy centers in a diamond tip coupled to nems resonators operating at room temperature @xcite offers a new route to detect a chemical element that carry a nuclear magnetic moment .",
    "this device is sensitive enough to determine the element identity and arrangement in a complex molecule . in the case of mass spectroscopy ,",
    "nems resonators are believed to enable in the future a detection device operating with resolution better than 1 dalton ( the hydrogen atom mass ) @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the state - of - the - art is that single gold atoms can be measured @xcite .",
    "trapped ions are well studied quantum systems where experimental control of coherent quantum dynamics , state preparation , and measurement are achieved with great precision and good fidelity @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", trapped ions have been demonstrated to achieve an error probability per randomized single - qubit gate below the threshold estimate commonly considered sufficient for fault - tolerant quantum computing @xcite .",
    "this achievement of low single - qubit - gate errors is an essential step toward scalable quantum computers and simulators .",
    "it is then clear that a hybrid system composed of trapped ions and nems resonators represent an interesting platform to study the interplay of quantum mechanical effects in atomic and nanoscopic systems .",
    "following this idea , one proposal @xcite suggest the use of a trapped ion as a probe or device controller acting on the nems . in another proposal @xcite ,",
    "trapped ions are applied to monitor and manipulate the number state of a nems resonator such that it enables a statistical inference of the mean phonon number of the oscillator .    here",
    ", we take a step forward and propose the use of a nems resonator to generate entanglement between two trapped ions .",
    "this is a conceptually important step since it goes the other way around of what is normally performed . instead of using the microsystem to cause quantum behavior of the mesoscopic system",
    ", we use the latter to enforce quantum correlations on the former .",
    "since a classical resonator is unable to generate entanglement among quantum systems coupled to it , this kind of study may work as a kind of classicality test in what concerns entanglement generation .",
    "we also study the qualitative behavior of tripartite entanglement as given by residual tripartite entanglement @xcite and contrast its dynamical behavior to the ones of the bipartite entanglements @xcite .",
    "moreover , we investigate the regime where nems is either in an initially thermal state or subjected to energy relaxation , where in the former case we see that the tripartite entanglement is more robust against energy relaxation than the bipartite entanglement when dynamics is concerned .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ model ] is dedicated to the presentation of the physical system studied here and section [ tools ] presents the theoretical tools necessary to understand the results presented in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] contains a summary of our results and conclusions .",
    "we dedicate two appendix to present details of some lengthy analytical expressions and further numerical analysis .",
    "in this work , we consider a system consisting of two separate trapped ions capacitively coupled to a small doubly clamped nano beam ( a nems resonator ) .",
    "the system is depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the ions - nems coupling results from the application of an external bias voltage at an electrode on the nems ( the bias gate is not shown in the picture ) .",
    "the interaction energy between the motional degree of freedom of an ion with charge @xmath0 and a nems with bias gate charge @xmath1 is given by the electrostatic coupling @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to position operators of one ion and the nems , respectively , around their equilibrium positions .",
    "at equilibrium , each ion is separated from the center of mass position of the nems by a distance @xmath5 .",
    "since we are dealing with positions around the equilibrium , the signs @xmath6 are necessary to distinguish one ion from the other , for example , one can associate @xmath7 with ion 1 and @xmath8 with ion 2 .",
    "typically , one finds that @xmath9 so that the coupling energy can be expanded as @xmath10}{d}+\\frac{[\\hat{x}_i-\\hat{x}]^2}{d^2}\\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the capacitance and gate voltage , respectively .",
    "according to ( [ vint ] ) , the coupling between the @xmath14 ion and the nems is just @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "the linear and quadratic terms involving @xmath17 or @xmath18 alone have been absorbed into redefinitions of equilibrium positions and oscillators frequencies .",
    "since the ions are not neutral particles , they will also couple by means of the same mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ , an interaction term proportional to @xmath19 @xcite . however , once the equilibrium distance between them is @xmath20 ( twice the distance to the nems ) and we will be considering identical traps ( identical oscillation frequencies ) , only resonant terms in @xmath19 will be relevant in this weak coupling regime ( rotating wave approximation rwa ) @xcite .",
    "considering @xmath21 as the interaction between each ion and the nems and a weak rwa interaction between the ions , the hamiltonian operator for this tripartite mechanical oscillating system reads @xmath22",

    ". we should remark that hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) , whose dynamics we will study , might appear in other interacting bosonic systems",
    ". a potential candidate would be the experimentally accessed optomechanical system in @xcite by expanding it to include two cavity modes ( corresponding to the ions ) interacting with a micromechanical oscillatory membrane .",
    "other interesting coupled bosonic systems are discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the vibrational motion of the ions are _ directly _ coupled by means of a beam - splitter - like interaction which is well known to not dynamically generate entanglement for direct products of thermal or coherent states @xcite . in this situation , by putting such ions in interaction with the nems , initial creation of entanglement will be the result of the action of this third party acting as an entangling device .",
    "the key element for the initial creation of ion - ion entanglement is the presence of terms of the kind @xmath32 or @xmath33 with strength @xmath34 providing an _ indirect _ squeezing interaction between the ions .",
    "this is an interesting problem because , being an indirect interaction , not all values of @xmath34 will lead to squeezing and entanglement in the ionic subsystem . studying the conditions for this to happen",
    "is one of the goals of this article . as a final remark",
    ", it is important to emphasize that hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) is quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators and then preserves gaussianity .",
    "in this section , we present the main tools used in this work .",

    "a semiquantitative approach is sufficient since we are not aiming at a particular quantum information protocol where a given value of an entanglement measure has a precise meaning .",

    "analytical expressions for the symplectic eigenvalues used to evaluate entanglement are quite lengthy and it is extremely difficult to extract the general trends seen in the plots from limits and approximations of these expressions . recognizing the importance of trying to understand the observed behavior through simple yet approximate expressions , we resort to numerics .",
    "we employed numerical routines to find the best fitting for a giving fitting function picked by us . in order to favor physical intuition in the open system markovian dynamics induced by dissipation in the nems ,",
    "our approach was in this case to enforce fitting with exponential functions , even though they might not be the most precise choice . by doing this , we were able , for instance , to assess the robustness of tripartite or bipartite entanglements facing dissipation in the nems .",
    "we start by deepen the analyzes of the unitary dynamics of entanglement presented in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "looking at the cm of the ion - ion subsystem , eq.([covions ] ) , and the relation ( [ sp1 ] ) , it is then possible to show that the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of ( [ covions ] ) can be written as @xmath171where @xmath172 and @xmath173 denotes the biggest and the smallest ordinary ( non symplectic ) eigenvalues of an arbitrary matrix @xmath174 .",
    "the condition for separability .",
    "] is expressed in this situation as @xmath175 and is possible to obtain the period of oscillation ( a function of @xmath103 and @xmath125 ) as the distance between two consecutive zeros of @xmath176 .",
    "the local maximum of entanglement will again be a function of @xmath103 and @xmath125 , and it can be found by calculating the maximum eigenvalue @xmath177 .",
    "these eigenvalues are given in terms of transcendental functions , and the solutions can only be determined numerically .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one can see that by increasing @xmath103 , the entanglement generated between the ions also increases while the period of oscillations decreases . to a better understanding of these important trends ,",
    "we fit our results with the functions @xmath178 @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the first local maximum of the logarithmic negativity and @xmath181 the period of the oscillation .",
    "the fit presented in fig .",
    "[ figap1 ] was performed setting @xmath182 the relative error of these fits are smaller than @xmath183 for the range @xmath184 $ ] , and @xmath127 was picked in accordance with ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the cases with different values of @xmath125 follow the same behavior as long as one sets @xmath185 and @xmath186 , and this can be seen directly from matrix elements of ( [ covions ] ) given in appendix a.     for the same situation of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the continuous line is the numerical fit performed with ( [ fit1 ] ) , ( [ fit1 t ] ) , and parameters ( [ fit1p ] ) . the relative error of these fits are smaller than @xmath183 . ]",
    "now we move to the situation where the entanglement depends also on the temperature through the parameter @xmath151 . taking ( [ sp2 ] ) into account",
    ", it is again possible to write something similar to ( [ se1 ] ) .",
    "explicitly we get @xmath187 where @xmath188 are combinations of functions of @xmath189 .",
    "this gives the dependence of the logarithmic negativity ( [ logsym ] ) on @xmath151 and it comes from the evaluation of the eigenvalues of @xmath190 when considering that any element of this matrix can be splitted as @xmath191 as commented in the main text .",
    "this is the exact situation shown in fig.[fig3 ] , for given choices of parameters .",
    "another interesting question is to follow the first maximum of entanglement in fig.[fig3 ] as the temperature changes .",
    "the position in time of the first maximum also changes when @xmath151 is varied , but the period is not changed .",
    "this is explained below . in fig.[figap2 ] , we present this dependence , and one can clearly see that in this case a exponential in @xmath192 approximates very well the observed behavior .",
    "we fit this curve with @xmath193 and @xmath194 we believe that these simple formulas ( [ fit1 ] ) and ( [ fit2 ] ) may be valuable for the experimentalist to formulate strategies to extract information about physical quantities such as temperature @xmath151 or ion - nems coupling @xmath103 through measurements of entanglement . moreover , given the special forms ( [ sp1 ] ) and ( [ sp2 ] ) , entanglement between the ions can then be extract from local measurements on one ion only , and consequently this applies to ( [ fit1 ] ) and ( [ fit2 ] ) .",
    "finally , the period of oscillations in fig.[fig3 ] does not depend on @xmath151 by the simple reason that time appears only in the symplectic matrix @xmath195 given by ( [ ev ] ) , and dependence on @xmath151 appears only in @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , the period is still given by ( [ fit1 t ] ) . for larger values of @xmath103 or @xmath151 , the behavior of the first maximum of entanglement remains the same , a decreasing exponential in @xmath197 and a growing function with @xmath103 , suggesting that the negativity will always be produced for a given choice of @xmath103 and @xmath151 , see fig.[figap2 ] .    .",
    "we consider here the same situation of fig.[fig3 ] with @xmath198 ( circles ) , @xmath152 ( squares ) and @xmath199 ( diamonds ) .",
    "we also plot a numerical fit for both set of points , the relative error of these fits are smaller than @xmath183 for all points and @xmath127 . ]    in the open dynamics we were mainly interested in assessing the robustness or fragility of the bipartite and tripartite entanglements .",
    "the procedure to calculate entanglement in gaussian systems relies on the determination of symplectic eigenvalues of matrices . in spite of the fact that the determination of the covariance matrix is in essence analytic",
    "as discussed in the main text , the expressions for the symplectic eigenvalues turn out to be huge combinations of non factorable exponentials , trigonometric and hyperbolic functions .",
    "the cumbersomeness of these expressions prevents us to explore analytically some of their consequences . in part",
    ", this is due to the fact that now the symmetry present in ( [ se1 ] ) is broken due to dissipation in the nems , and the analysis becomes purely numerical .     for the fixed instant of time @xmath200 .",
    "we consider here @xmath149 , @xmath154 and @xmath150 . in the inset we plot the local maxima of entanglement as function of time for @xmath201 .",
    "we show the tripartite entanglement s measure ( circles ) , the negativity of nems - ion subsystem ( squares ) and the bipartite ion - ion negativity ( diamonds )",
    ". we also plot a numerical fit for all set of points . ]",
    "first let us analyze how the amount of entanglement in a given time is affected by the mean occupation thermal number of the reservoir @xmath202 . in fig.[figap3",
    "] an example of this dependence and the fitting with decaying exponentials is presented .",
    "the fitting used in this case was @xmath203 from the values of @xmath204 and @xmath205 , it is pretty clear that the temperature of the nems reservoir affect both tripartite and bipartite entanglements in essentially the same way .",
    "however , in the inset we present the sequence of local maxima for a fixed reservoir temperature ( fixed @xmath95 ) , and it seems that the tripartite entanglement is more robust in the sense that it decays slowly than the bipartite counterparts .",
    "interestingly , this is indeed the case as understood from the best exponential fitting @xmath206 it is interesting to check whether or not the decay time scale for the entanglements are comparable to the ones of the langevin dynamics which is around @xmath207 . in the case of the inset of fig.[figap3 ] , we set @xmath154 , and it is then clear that the decay of entanglement do not necessarily occur at such precise scale but it decays at a time which is of the same order ( around @xmath208 ) .",
    "we carry on the throughly analyzes of this open system case , by looking into the dependence of the entanglements with the damping constant constant @xmath96 .",
    "this study is presented in fig.[figap4 ] , and the fitting used was @xmath210      since all entanglement in the system is created by the coupling @xmath103 , it might be interesting to see how fast the maximum entanglement is achieved as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[figap5 ] . in this case , the exponential is not very appropriate and we fit with @xmath212 where @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 .",
