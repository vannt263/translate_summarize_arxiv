    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite are universal non - perturbative objects entering the description of hard exclusive electroproduction processes ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and references ) .",
    "these gpds , which are defined for each quark flavor ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , parametrize nonforward matrix elements of lightcone operators .",
    "they depend upon the longitudinal momentum fractions of the initial and final quarks and upon the overall momentum transfer @xmath3 to the nucleon . when the momentum fractions @xmath4 of initial and final quarks are different ( @xmath5 being the longitudinal momentum asymmetry , or skewness ) , one accesses quark momentum correlations in the nucleon . furthermore ,",
    "if one of the quark momentum fractions is negative , gpds reflect an antiquark contribution , and consequently one can investigate @xmath6 configurations in the nucleon .",
    "therefore , these functions contain a wealth of new nucleon structure information , generalizing that obtained from inclusive deep inelastic scattering .",
    "in hard exclusive processes , such as deeply virtual compton scattering , gpds enter in most observables through convolution integrals .",
    "hence , to access gpds , the most realistic strategy to date seems through judicial parametrizations .",
    "building self - consistent models of gpds is , however , a rather difficult problem , because one needs to satisfy many physical principles and constraints which should be obeyed by gpds .",
    "they include spectral properties , polynomiality condition , positivity , relations to parton densities and form factors @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we elaborate on the @xmath3-dependence of the @xmath7 generalized parton distributions , and its interplay with the @xmath8-dependence .",
    "this subject has attracted a considerable interest .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that by a fourier transform of the @xmath3-dependence of gpds , it is conceivable to access the spatial distribution of partons in the transverse plane , and to provide a 3-dimensional picture of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of moments of gpds has also become amenable to lattice qcd calculations  @xcite recently .",
    "as the lattice calculations mature further , they may eventually provide additional constraints on moments of generalized parton distributions .",
    "phenomenological estimates of the @xmath3-dependence and @xmath3-dependent parametrizations of gpds have already been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and more recently , in ref .",
    "some results of the present paper were reported in refs .",
    "we give here several parametrizations of the @xmath3-dependence of the gpds , both at small and large values of @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 , i.e. in the spacelike region ) .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : sumrule ] by reviewing the relevant sum rules which link gpds to form factors .",
    "subsequently , we discuss in section  [ sec : gaussian ] a gaussian ansatz for the @xmath3-dependence of gpds ( at large @xmath9 ) which has been introduced and used in refs . @xcite",
    "such a gaussian ansatz , however , is not able to describe the small @xmath9 behavior of gpds , and in particular gives divergent rms radii for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "we therefore proceed in section  [ sec : regge1 ] to describe a regge parametrization @xcite which provides a physically consistent behavior of form factors at small @xmath9 .",
    "we extend this model then in section  [ sec : regge2 ] to large @xmath9 so as to yield the observed power behavior of the electromagnetic form factors at large ( spacelike ) momentum transfers .",
    "we found a quite economical parametrization that allows for a description of both proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors with only 3 parameters : the universal regge slope @xmath11 and two parameters @xmath12 governing the @xmath13 behavior of the splin - flip gpds @xmath14 relative to that of the usual parton densities @xmath15 .",
    "we discuss the comparison of our results with the data in section  [ sec : results ] , and use our parametrization to estimate the quark contribution to the nucleon spin . in section  [ sec : impact ] , we discuss the positivity constraints on gpds in the impact parameter @xmath16 representation . to extend the region in @xmath8 and @xmath16 where the positivity constraints are satisfied , we propose a model in which the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are equal .",
    "it provides ( with just two parameters ) almost the same quality description of the four form factors as the 3-parameter model .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the nucleon dirac and pauli form factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 can be calculated from the valence quark gpds @xmath22 and @xmath23 through the following sum rules for their flavor components ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 since the result of the integration does not depend on the skewness @xmath5 , one can choose @xmath26 in the previous equations .",
    "furthermore , the integration region can be reduced to the @xmath27 interval , introducing the nonforward parton densities  @xcite : @xmath28 obeying the conditions @xmath29 that follow from the sum rules ( [ eq : hsumrule ] ) , ( [ eq : esumrule ] ) .",
    "the @xmath30 functions also satisfy the @xmath31 reduction relations @xmath32 connecting them with the usual valence quark densities in the proton .",
    "the @xmath33 limit of the @xmath34 distributions exists , but the `` magnetic '' densities @xmath35 can not be directly expressed in terms of any known parton distribution : they contain new information about the nucleon structure .",
    "however , the normalization integrals @xmath36 are constrained by the requirement that the values @xmath37 and @xmath38 are equal to the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron .",
    "this gives @xmath39 for comparison , the normalization integrals for the @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions are given by 2 and 1 respectively , the number of @xmath0 and @xmath1 valence quarks in the proton .",
    "the simplest model for the proton s @xmath30 is to separate the @xmath8 and @xmath3-dependencies and express it as the product @xmath42 of the parton density @xmath43 and the @xmath19 form factor of the proton .",
    "it trivially reproduces @xmath43 in the forward limit and gives the correct result for @xmath44 .",
    "however , such a complete factorization of the @xmath8 and @xmath3 dependencies seems rather unrealistic . in particular , the form factor formula @xcite @xmath45 of the light - cone formalism is a convolution of the light cone wave functions containing nonfactorizable combinations @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath47-body fock component @xmath48 of the light - cone wave function usually depends on the transverse momenta @xmath49 through the @xmath50 combination involving both @xmath51 and the fractions @xmath52 of the hadron longitudinal momentum carried by the quarks .",
    "if the dependence on this combination has a gaussian form , the @xmath53 integration can be performed analytically providing an example of the interplay between the @xmath8 and @xmath3 dependencies .",
    "the result of integration can be most easily illustrated on the simplest example of a two parton system ( @xmath54 ) . in this case @xmath55 assuming the gaussian ansatz @xmath56 =    \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{k_{\\perp } ^2}{2x(1-x)\\lambda^2 } \\right ] \\",
    ",    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 has the meaning of the two - body part of the quark density @xmath59 .",
    "this suggests the gaussian ( g ) parametrization @xcite for the nonforward parton densities @xmath60 containing a nontrivial interplay between @xmath8 and @xmath3 dependencies .",
    "the scale @xmath61 characterizes the average transverse momentum of the valence quarks in the nucleon .",
    "the best agreement ( within 10% ) between experimental data for @xmath44 in the moderately large @xmath3 region 1gev@xmath62gev@xmath63 and calculations based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fi ] ) , ( [ eq : f1q ] ) , ( [ eq : gauss ] ) is obtained for @xmath64gev@xmath63 .",
    "this value corresponds to an average transverse momentum of about 300 mev @xcite , which is close to the inverse of the proton size .",
    "the latter can also be estimated by calculating the mean squared radius @xmath65 the gaussian model for @xmath30 then gives the expression @xmath66 if one assumes the standard regge - type behavior @xmath67 of the parton densities at small @xmath8 , the integral in ( [ eq : gaussrms1p ] ) diverges . to get a finite slope we should modify the model for @xmath30 in the region of small @xmath8",
    "the regge picture suggests a @xmath68 behavior at small @xmath8 or the @xmath69 model for the nonforward densities @xmath30 . assuming a linear regge trajectory with the slope @xmath70",
    ", we get @xmath71 this ansatz was already discussed in ref .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flavor components of the dirac form factor are then given by @xmath72 the proton and neutron dirac form factors follow from @xmath73 by construction @xmath74 = 1 , and @xmath75 = 0 .",
    "the dirac mean squared radii of proton and neutron in this model are given by @xmath76 instead of the @xmath77 factor present in the gaussian model , we have now a much softer logarithmic singularity at small @xmath8 , and the integrals for @xmath78 converge . to calculate @xmath79 , we need an ansatz for the nonforward parton densities @xmath34 .",
    "we assume the same regge - type structure @xmath80 as for @xmath30 .",
    "the next step is to model the forward magnetic densities @xmath81 .",
    "the simplest idea is to take them proportional to the @xmath82 densities .",
    "choosing @xmath83 we satisfy the normalization conditions ( [ eq : kappas ] ) which , in their turn , guarantee that @xmath84 = @xmath85 , and @xmath86 = @xmath87 . as we will show in section  [ sec : results ] , the regge model r1 fits @xmath44 and @xmath88 data for small momentum transfers @xmath89gev@xmath63 .",
    "however , the suppression at larger @xmath9 in the r1 model is too strong , and it consequently falls considerably short of the data for @xmath90gev@xmath63 .",
    "to improve the agreement with the data at large @xmath9 , we need to modify our models .",
    "note , that both the gaussian ( g ) and the regge - type model ( r1 ) discussed above have the structure @xmath91 \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "hence , at large @xmath3 , the form factors are dominated by integration over regions where @xmath94 or @xmath95 . in both cases",
    ", @xmath96 vanishes only for @xmath13 , and the large-@xmath3 asymptotics of @xmath97 is governed by the @xmath13 region . given @xmath98 as @xmath13 , one derives that if @xmath99 for @xmath8 close to 1 , then the form factors drop like @xmath100 at large @xmath3 .",
    "experimentally , @xmath101 is close to 3 , thus the models g and r1 correspond to the @xmath102 behavior for the form factors .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the experimentally established @xmath103 behavior of @xmath104 , so one may be tempted to conclude that these models have no chance to describe the data .",
    "a trivial but important remark is that the model curves for @xmath104 are more complicated functions than just a pure power behavior @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , up to 10gev@xmath63 , the gaussian model reproduces the data for @xmath106 within 10%  @xcite . for higher @xmath3 , the gaussian model prediction for @xmath106 drops faster than @xmath103 and goes below the data .",
    "however , the nominal @xmath107 asymptotics is achieved only at very large values @xmath108 500gev@xmath63 . as we show in section  [ sec : results ] , the regge - type model r1 result visibly underestimates the data for @xmath106 already for @xmath108 1gev@xmath63 though one should wait till @xmath108 100gev@xmath63 to see that the @xmath107 behavior really settles .",
    "thus , the conclusions made on the basis of asymptotic relations might be of little importance in the experimentally accessible region : a curve with a `` wrong '' large-@xmath3 behaviour might be quite successful phenomenologically in a rather wide range of @xmath3 .",
    "the shortcomings of the g and r1 models are more of a theoretical nature .",
    "namely , they do not satisfy the drell - yan ( dy ) relation @xcite between the @xmath13 behavior of the structure functions and the @xmath3-dependence of elastic form factors . according to dy , if the parton density behaves like @xmath109 , then the relevant form factor should decrease as @xmath110 for large @xmath3 .",
    "such a relation does not hold if @xmath111 but it holds if @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the simplest idea is to attach an extra @xmath113 factor to the original @xmath96 functions . to preserve the regge structure at small @xmath8 and @xmath3 we take the modified regge ansatz r2 @xcite @xmath114 the inability of the g parametrization to satisfy",
    "the dy relation may seem rather surprizing in view of the fact that the original derivation of the relation by drell and yan @xcite is based on the analysis of the large-@xmath115 limit of the general formula ( [ eq : drellyan ] ) of which the g ansatz is a specific case corresponding to @xmath116 and the @xmath117 $ ] wave function .",
    "note , that if the wave function @xmath118 depends on @xmath53 through the combination @xmath119 , then the restriction on the @xmath120 integration region should be @xmath121 which results in the @xmath122 constraint on the @xmath8 integration . also , from the explicit form of the gaussian parametrization ( [ eq : gauss ] ) , it is clear that the essential region for the @xmath123 integration is @xmath124 which gives the @xmath125 result , that differs from the canonical @xmath110 dy prediction .",
    "the resolution of this discrepancy is rather simple .",
    "in fact , in the derivation given by drell and yan , it was implied that the wave function depends on @xmath53 through the combination @xmath126 , with @xmath127 being the ( constituent ) quark mass . then , in the gaussian case , after the @xmath53-integration , one would have the structure @xmath128/\\lambda^2 ] \\}$ ] in the @xmath129 region , and at large @xmath130 the dominant contribution comes from the region @xmath131 .",
    "this agrees with the argumentation of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the leading contribution to the form factor is due to integration over the region @xmath132 where the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath123 of the active quark is close to 1 and those of the passive quarks are close to 0 , so that @xmath133 and all @xmath134 are bounded by @xmath135 .",
    "integration over all @xmath136 s and @xmath52 s of passive quarks gives @xmath137 .",
    "if @xmath138 , then the final integration over the region @xmath139 gives @xmath140 .",
    "turning back to the gaussian model with zero quark mass , it is easy to realize that the factor @xmath141 in the exponent of the g parametrization may be viewed as @xmath142 ^ 2/ x(1-x)\\lambda^2 $ ] with @xmath143 coming from the @xmath144 $ ] structure of the @xmath53-dependence of the wave function . as we have seen , to get the regge - type behavior at small @xmath8 , one should soften the @xmath77 factor in the exponential substituting it by @xmath145 . since the limit @xmath146 for the active quark corresponds to the regge limit @xmath147 for the spectators",
    ", one may expect by analogy that the @xmath148 singularity is also softened after inclusion of higher fock components .",
    "the r2 ansatz corresponds to substitution of the @xmath148 factor by a constant .",
    "other arguments in favor of the r2 model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correlation between the power behavior of form factors and the behavior of inclusive structure functions @xmath149 of deeply inelastic scattering at large bjorken variable @xmath150 is a rather popular subject ( `` inclusive - exclusive connection '' ) .",
    "the basic idea behind the possibility of such a correlation is that , for sufficiently large @xmath151 , one approaches the exclusive single - hadron pole .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath152 of the hadronic system produced in deep inelastic scattering is related to the bjorken variable @xmath150 by @xmath153 and the single - hadron contribution to cross section is given by the form factor squared multiplied by @xmath154 .",
    "the bloom - gilman duality idea @xcite is that the @xmath155-integral of the hadron contribution is equal to the @xmath8-integral of the structure function @xmath156 over a duality region with fixed boundaries in the variable @xmath155 .",
    "this gives a relation between the power @xmath101 specifying the @xmath157 behavior of the structure function @xmath156 in the @xmath13 region and the power - law behavior of the squared elastic form factor : @xmath158 . in the proton case ,",
    "with usually adopted value @xmath159 , one obtains a dipole behavior for the dirac @xmath160 form factor .",
    "we would like to strongly emphasize here that one should not confuse the bloom - gilman duality with the drell - yan relation @xcite .",
    "as we discussed above , the latter connects some integral of a nonforward parton density @xmath161 over the interval @xmath162 with the first power of the form factor .",
    "it is worth to repeat and stress the statement : the bloom - gilman relation connects an @xmath8 integral of the structure function with the _ square _ of the form factor , while the dy relation expresses an(other ) @xmath8 integral of the structure function in terms of the _ first power _ of the form factor .",
    "moreover , the dominance of the region @xmath163 implied by the dy relation is a consequence of a specific structure of the density @xmath161 , the interplay between its @xmath8 and @xmath3 dependence .",
    "as we have seen , the drell - yan relation does not work for the gaussian model , but it holds for the modified regge model r2 .",
    "one should also realize that both relations were formulated before the qcd era , and in absolutely nonperturbative terms .",
    "their authors did not assume that the shape of the structure function @xmath164 or that of the nonforward parton densities @xmath30 are generated by perturbative qcd dynamics based on hard gluon exchanges .",
    "their prescription was that knowing the @xmath13 behavior of the structure functions , one can use bloom - gilman or drell - yan relations to get predictions for form factors .",
    "both relations have a common feature : if one changes the power @xmath101 in the @xmath157 behavior of the structure function , this would result in a change of the @xmath165 power behavior of the form factor , i.e. , the powers themselves are not fixed , what is fixed is the relation(s ) between them .",
    "accidentally , both relations give the same correlation between the two powers , and that is why they are confused sometimes .    in distinction to the bloom - gilman and drell - yan relations , perturbative",
    "qcd predicts definite powers for the asymptotic behavior of form factors and the @xmath13 behavior of parton distributions .",
    "for example , it gives @xmath166 for a spin - averaged form factor of an @xmath47-quark hadron , and it also predicts fixed powers @xmath167 for the @xmath13 behavior of its valence quark distributions ( see @xcite ) . for the @xmath1 quark distribution compared to the @xmath0 one , uniformly accepting a   @xmath168 behavior rather than pqcd s @xmath169 form for @xmath1 quarks . ]",
    "the basic difference between the pqcd formulas and bg & dy relations is that a particular power behavior of a hadronic form factor in pqcd _ is not a consequence _ of a particular limiting power behavior of the respective parton distribution in the region @xmath13 .",
    "the fixed powers predicted by pqcd are correlated simply because of similarity of the relevant diagrams , but there is no causal connection between them .",
    "also , though the powers predicted by pqcd for the nucleon are in agreement with bg and dy relations , it was never demonstrated that there is a fundamental reason behind this fact .",
    "formally , the relevant powers of @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 for the proton are correlated in pqcd just like in the bloom - gilman relation .",
    "however , a direct calculation of pqcd diagrams for @xmath156 gives expressions which have more complicated structure than the squares of form factors ( see e.g. , @xcite , where the @xmath13 behavior of gpds is also discussed ) . thus , it is not clear yet if the bloom - gilman relation works in pqcd .    with the drell - yan relation ,",
    "the situation is simpler .",
    "the whole logic of the hard - rescattering pqcd mechanism is orthogonal to the feynman - drell - yan approach . in the pioneering paper by lepage and brodsky @xcite",
    ", it was emphasized in the introduction of that paper that the drell - yan relation is invalid in pqcd .",
    "it was stressed , in particular , that the correlation between the powers of @xmath172 in pqcd predictions disagrees with the drell - yan relation .",
    "for instance , the leading @xmath173 term in @xmath156 for the nucleon is attributed in pqcd to diagrams involving four hard gluon exchanges , and is accompanied hence by the @xmath174 factor . integrating it over the region @xmath175",
    ", one would get a contribution @xmath176 that has the same @xmath177 power as the pqcd prediction for the nucleon form factor , but has two extra powers of @xmath172 .",
    "our models imply the dominating role of the feynman - drell - yan mechanism for the hadronic form factors , and we assume that the @xmath13 behavior of the parton distributions is generated by nonperturbative dynamics . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed behaviour of hadronic form factors is also due to the nonperturbative dynamics , and we treat as negligible the pqcd contributions to the nucleon form factors , which have @xmath178 suppression compared to the nonperturbative terms . in the following estimates",
    "we take the unpolarized parton distributions at input scale @xmath179 = 1 gev@xmath63 from the mrst2002 global nnlo fit  @xcite as  : @xmath180 one sees that @xmath181 and @xmath182 at a scale @xmath179 = 1  gev@xmath63 .",
    "hence , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath104 in the r2 model is @xmath183 , generating a slightly faster decrease than the `` canonical '' @xmath103 .",
    "again , this asymptotic limit sets in for very large @xmath3 values . at small @xmath3 ,",
    "the modifications compared to the r1 model are not very significant numerically .",
    "the dirac mean squared radii of proton and neutron in the r2 model are finite and given by @xmath184 in case of the pauli form factor @xmath79 , we perform the same modification of the ansatz for the @xmath34 densities taking @xmath185 experimentally , the proton helicity flip form factor @xmath20 has a faster power fall - off at large @xmath3 than @xmath19 . within all our models",

    "the @xmath189 limit of the density @xmath190 should have extra powers of @xmath191 compared to that of @xmath192 ( in case of the g model , such a modeling was originally incorporated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . aiming to avoid introducing too many free parameters , we try the simplest ansatz for @xmath190 in which we get them by just multiplying the valence quark distributions by an additional factor @xmath193 , i.e. , we take @xmath194 where the normalization factors @xmath195 and @xmath196 @xmath197 guarantee the conditions ( [ eq : kappas ] ) .",
