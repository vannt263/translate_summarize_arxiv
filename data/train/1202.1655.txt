    "this paper is motivated by a recent collection of papers @xcite , which in turn were motivated by some combinatorial questions in statistical physics , namely the properties of the witten index in the so - called hard squares model @xcite .    in the hard - core model on a grid",
    "we are given a graph @xmath0 and particles ( fermions ) located in the vertices of the grid , with the restrictions that two adjacent vertices can not be occupied at the same time .",
    "that leads to considering the _ independent sets _ in @xmath0 , which represent the allowed states of the system .",
    "the family of all independent sets in @xmath0 naturally forms a simplicial complex , the _ independence complex _ @xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "various topological invariants of @xmath1 correspond to physical characteristics of the underlying hard - core model . among those",
    "are e.g. homology @xcite or the euler characteristic which is re - branded as the witten index @xcite .",
    "sometimes it is even possible to determine the exact homotopy type of @xmath1 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we continue the research line of jonsson studying these spaces for the square grids with various boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the path with @xmath3 vertices and let @xmath4 be the cycle with @xmath5 vertices .",
    "the free square grid is @xmath6 , its cylindrical version is @xmath7 and the toroidal one is @xmath8 .",
    "here a ) is a classical result of kozlov @xcite , while d ) and e ) also follow from @xcite where those spaces were identified with spheres by means of explicit morse matchings .",
    "the results b ) , c ) and f ) are new and were independently proved by a different method in @xcite . note that a ) , b ) , c ) are ` dual ' to , respectively , d ) , e ) and f ) in the light of thapper s conjecture ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) ( also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conj . 1.9 ) ) that @xmath16 .",
    "if one assumes the conjecture holds , then a ) , b ) and c ) are equivalent to , respectively , d ) , e ) and f ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : periods ] together with an easy verification of initial conditions imply the conjecture for @xmath17 .",
    "the statements d ) , e ) and f ) take the periodicity of euler characteristic , proved by jonsson @xcite , to the level of homotopy type .",
    "according to the calculation of k. iriye @xcite there is an equivalence @xmath18 and both spaces are , up to homotopy , wedges of spheres .",
    "however , the number of wedge summands grows to infinity as @xmath19 , so no recursive relation as simple as those in theorem  [ thm : periods ] is possible for @xmath20 nor @xmath21 .            in the second part of this work we aim to provide a method of recursively calculating the euler characteristic in the cylindrical case",
    "@xmath26 when the circumference @xmath5 is even .",
    "since it is customary to use the witten index in this context , we will adopt the same approach and define for any space @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the unreduced euler characteristic .",
    "then @xmath30 for a contractible @xmath27 , @xmath31 for any finite simplicial complex @xmath27 , and @xmath32 .",
    "then the value @xmath33 is what is usually called the witten index of the underlying grid model .",
    "table 1 in the appendix contains some initial values of @xmath34 arranged so that @xmath3 labels the rows and @xmath5 labels the columns of the table .",
    "let @xmath35 be the generating function of the sequence in the @xmath5-th column",
    ". by an ingenious matching jonsson @xcite computed the numbers @xmath36 for odd circumferences and found that for each fixed @xmath5 they are either constantly @xmath37 or periodically repeating @xmath38 .",
    "precisely @xmath39 the behaviour of @xmath40 is an open problem of that work , which we tackle here . also , recently braun notes that some problems faced in @xcite are reminiscent of the difficulty of determining the homotopy types of the spaces @xmath41 .",
    "our method also provides an algorithm to calculate @xmath42 , see appendix .",
    "this already implies that for each fixed @xmath5 the sequence @xmath43 has polynomial growth .",
    "however , we can probably be more explicit :    [ thm : genfunmedium ] for every @xmath44 we have @xmath45},\\\\ f_{4n}(t)&=&\\frac{h_{4n}(t)}{(1-t^2)\\cdot\\big[(1-t^{8n-6})(1-t^{8n-12})(1-t^{8n-18})\\cdots(1-t^{2n+6})\\big]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some polynomials @xmath46 .",
    "* @xmath49 can be written as a quotient whose denominator has no multiple zeroes .",
    "consequently , for any fixed @xmath5 , the sequence @xmath50 is periodic .",
    "* @xmath51 can be written as a quotient whose denominator has only double zeroes .",
    "consequently , for any fixed @xmath5 , the sequence @xmath52 has linear growth ."
