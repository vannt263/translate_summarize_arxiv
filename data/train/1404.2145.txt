    "electron magneto - hydrodynamics ( emhd ) is a regime of plasma physics in which positive and neutral particles are approximately immobile , so that only the dynamics of the ( lighter ) electrons needs to be considered @xcite .",
    "the flow of electrons induces magnetic fields  via the hall effect , and the magnetic field  influences the electrons via the lorentz force .",
    "emhd was first studied in the context of laboratory plasma experiments @xcite , where it is applicable on scales smaller than the ion skin depth , and has also been used to explain ( nearly ) collisionless reconnection in the solar corona and magnetotail @xcite .",
    "another important application of emhd is in neutron stars @xcite . within the outermost 1 km of a neutron star , called the crust ,",
    "the ions are locked into a solid lattice , and the dynamics of the magnetic field  is therefore governed by the emhd equations .",
    "the structure and topology of the magnetic field  determines the pattern of radiation from the star , and thus its observational signature , thermal evolution , and spin - down timescale @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the magnetic field  in the crust can trigger radiation bursts and flares , either via internal crustal failure @xcite or by twisting the external magnetic field  lines until they undergo fast reconnection @xcite .",
    "an important question then is whether magnetic fields  in emhd have a preferred structure , and whether some field configurations are unstable .",
    "although there have been many studies of instability and turbulence in emhd , almost all of the known instabilities require either finite ohmic resistivity @xcite or finite electron inertia @xcite . in the crust of a neutron star ,",
    "however , electron inertia is entirely negligible in comparison with the lorentz and coulomb forces .",
    "furthermore , most studies of emhd turbulence have only considered the structure of the field in spectral space @xcite .",
    "more recently , numerical simulations have suggested that the magnetic field  in a neutron star crust evolves towards a quasi - equilibrium , `` frozen - in '' state on a relatively short timescale ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "however , these studies are all either two - dimensional , or else neglect variations in the electron density .",
    "whether the quasi - equilibrium states found in these studies would be dynamically stable under more realistic conditions is unknown .",
    "@xcite , hereafter , have presented numerical results demonstrating an instability in the inertia - less emhd equations , which they argue is caused by hall drift in the presence of a non - uniform magnetic field , and which they called the `` hall drift instability '' .",
    "however , they find that the growth - rate of the instability is very sensitive to the choice of boundary conditions , and also seems to vanish in the limit of high electrical conductivity .",
    "these observations suggest that the instability may , in fact , be a resistive tearing mode rather than an instability of the hall term itself .",
    "the distinction is important , because tearing instability occurs only for rather particular magnetic field  configurations , which calls into question the general applicability of s results to neutron stars .",
    "tearing instability generally occurs only if the magnetic field  has a null surface , within which the ideal emhd equations become singular .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the stability properties of inertia - less ehmd equilibrium states , for both finite and infinite electrical conductivity .",
    "we also consider the effect of non - uniform electron density , which was neglected in s original model , but included in a subsequent work @xcite .",
    "this effect is almost certainly important in real neutron star crusts , in which the electron density scale - height is typically only a few percent of the crust thickness @xcite . we show that electron velocity shear together with density gradients can produce an instability , which resembles an instability described originally in ref .  .",
    "we suggest that this density - shear instability  was present in the results of ref .  , which explains the significant discrepancies between their results and those of .",
    "we present an explicit , analytical instance of the density - shear instability , and discuss its implications for the evolution of magnetic fields  in neutron star crusts .",
    "the basic equations describing emhd are @xmath1 these are , respectively , faraday s law , ampre s law , and the force balance for the electron fluid in gaussian cgs units . here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath4 is the electric current , @xmath5 is the electron fluid velocity , @xmath6 is the electron number density , @xmath7 is the electron pressure , @xmath8 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath9 is the speed of light , and @xmath10 is the elementary charge .",
    "note that we neglect the electron inertia in equation  ( [ eq : balance ] ) , which is negligible on scales much larger than the electron skin depth , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the effective mass of the electrons . in the crust of a neutron star",
    "the skin depth is tiny , @xmath13 , making this an excellent approximation @xcite . as noted earlier , the absence of electron inertia has important implications for emhd stability , because most known instabilities in emhd arise from inertial effects .",
    "the electric current produced by the flow of electrons is @xmath14 and substituting this relation into equation  ( [ eq : balance ] ) yields a generalized ohm s law .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : ampere ] ) and ( [ eq : j ] ) together imply that the electron density @xmath6 is steady in the eulerian description , because @xmath15 equations  ( [ eq : faraday])([eq : j ] ) can be combined into a single equation for the evolution of the magnetic field , @xmath16    + \\frac{c}{{{\\rm e}}n^2}{{\\bm{\\nabla}}}p\\times{{\\bm{\\nabla}}}n .",

    "this term becomes negligible at sufficiently low temperatures , for which the electron gas is fully degenerate and therefore barotropic .",
    "more precisely , the biermann term is negligible in comparison with the hall term if @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fermi energy and @xmath19 is the fermi temperature .",

    "the relative importance of the hall and ohmic decay terms in equation  ( [ eq : dimensional ] ) is measured by the hall parameter , @xmath25 for the parameter values just given we find @xmath26 , implying that the hall term dominates the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "assuming a typical lengthscale @xmath27 , comparable to the thickness of the crust , the characteristic timescale for magnetic field  evolution is then @xmath28    in what follows , we work exclusively with non - dimensional quantities .",

    "the surface integral vanishes , and so the magnetic energy decays in time , at a rate that depends on the diffusivity @xmath32 .",

    "we take @xmath44  any other constant value can be obtained simply by rescaling the magnetic field .",

    "this equation then becomes simply @xmath59 by analogy with the one - dimensional schrdinger equation for a potential well , we see that in order for this equation to have bounded solutions the right - hand side must be negative for some range of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore a necessary condition for instability ( i.e. ,  @xmath60 ) is that the term @xmath61 must be negative for some range of @xmath53 .",
    "argue that there will be unstable modes provided that @xmath61 is chosen to be sufficiently negative ( see also ref .",

    "if the boundary conditions are chosen so that the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : parts ] ) vanishes , then we deduce that @xmath66 implying that the growth - rate @xmath55 is purely imaginary , and so all modes are neutrally stable .",
    "this conclusion also applies for practically any other sensible choice of boundary conditions .",
    "for example , suppose that our domain is @xmath67 , and that the region outside the domain is a vacuum .",
    "the background field must then have @xmath68 at @xmath69 , and the boundary conditions for the perturbations are @xmath70 at @xmath69 .",
    "the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : parts ] ) is then negative , and the conclusion that @xmath55 is imaginary holds even more strongly . allowing for @xmath71 does not alter this conclusion",
    "; in fact , it can be shown from equation  ( [ eq:2d_linear ] ) that the generalization of equation  ( [ eq : bound ] ) when @xmath71 is @xmath72 ^ 2 =    \\dfrac{\\displaystyle k_x^2\\int\\!{{\\rm d}}z\\,\\left|b_z ' - \\dfrac{b'}{b}b_z\\right|^2    + k_x^2(k_x^2+k_y^2)\\int\\!{{\\rm d}}z\\,|b_z|^2}{\\displaystyle\\int\\!{{\\rm d}}z\\,\\dfrac{|b_z|^2}{b^2 } }    + \\left[\\tfrac{1}{2}k_y\\dfrac{\\displaystyle\\int\\!{{\\rm d}}z\\,\\frac{b'}{b^2}|b_z|^2}{\\displaystyle\\int\\!{{\\rm d}}z\\,\\frac{|b_z|^2}{b^2}}\\right]^2 .",

    "we note that this result contradicts ref .  , which claimed to have demonstrated instability for a magnetic field  with straight field lines .",
    "although their derivation assumes finite electron inertia , their instability remains even in the limit of zero inertia .",
    "we suggest that there are three reasons why they obtained this incorrect result .",
    "first , they assumed a background magnetic field  that varies in one direction , but they only considered perturbations that are invariant in that direction .",
    "this is equivalent to seeking solutions of equation  ( [ eq:3d_linear ] ) for which the left - hand side vanishes , which is obviously impossible for any non - trivial magnetic field .",
    "second , they prescribed a uniform background magnetic field  and a non - uniform background current , which is incompatible with ampre s law ( [ eq : ampere ] ) .",
    "third , they considered a localized region in which the current changes sign , and therefore neglected terms involving the current while retaining terms involving its spatial gradient .",
    "there is no rigorous basis for this approximation .",
    "we believe that these inconsistencies explain the contradiction between their results and ours .",
    "we emphasize , however , that there _ are _ instabilities in the emhd equations when the fluid has finite inertia .",
    "this can be proved by simply observing that , on scales much smaller than the electron skin depth , the emhd equations become identical to the equations for an incompressible , non - magnetic fluid @xcite , for which there are numerous well - known instabilities .",
    "the argument presented in the last section assumes , implicitly , that all of the integrals in equations  ( [ eq : parts])([eq : bound2 ] ) are well defined .",
    "however , if the background field in equation  ( [ eq:1d ] ) is chosen such that @xmath52 vanishes somewhere within the domain then these integrals may be singular .",
    "we see from equations  ( [ eq:2d_linear ] ) and ( [ eq:1d_linear ] ) that the eigenmodes are also singular in such cases .",
    "this suggests that reintroducing finite resistivity , @xmath77 , will significantly alter the structure of the eigenmodes , as well as their stability properties .",
    "in particular , by analogy with `` regular '' mhd , we anticipate that such fields can be subject to resistive tearing instabilities @xcite .",
    "the existence of tearing instabilities in emhd has been convincingly demonstrated previously @xcite , so here we simply summarize the essential points of the analysis , and compare the predictions of the theory with the results of . for simplicity , we also restrict attention to modes of the form given by equation  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) with @xmath58 ; the fastest growing mode found by was in this category .",
    "suppose that @xmath52 vanishes for some value of @xmath53 , say @xmath78 .",
    "if resistive diffusion is sufficiently weak then we expect equation  ( [ eq:1d_linear ] ) to hold to a good approximation away from the singularity at @xmath79 .",
    "we refer to the solution of this equation as the `` outer '' solution . in a neighborhood of the singularity",
    "we approximate @xmath80 , and we assume that @xmath32 is constant . substituting the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) , we thus obtain a pair of coupled equations for @xmath81 and @xmath65 , @xmath82 whose solution we will call the `` inner '' solution . for now , we assume that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are of order unity , and that @xmath32 is of order @xmath33 .",
    "we then find that resistive diffusion only becomes important on scales smaller than @xmath85 , and we therefore approximate @xmath86 in these equations .",
    "we seek solutions for which @xmath87 is antisymmetric about @xmath79 and @xmath88 is symmetric .",
    "following ref .",
    "we anticipate that , provided @xmath89 , both @xmath87 and @xmath88 will be approximately constant in a neighborhood of @xmath79 .",
    "this allows us to approximate equations  ( [ eq : inner1 ] ) and ( [ eq : inner2 ] ) as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the value of @xmath88 at @xmath78 . finally , we introduce a stretched coordinate @xmath92 , which leads to the following equation for the quantity @xmath93 : @xmath94 this is a special case of the equation obtained in ref .  , and",

    "the effective boundary conditions for the outer solution in their case are therefore @xmath105 we are now in a position to calculate the dispersion relation for the emhd tearing modes .",

    "although we are not able to analytically predict the exact wavenumber and growth - rate for the background field studied by , we can make the following predictions regarding the most unstable tearing mode in their case :    1 .   in the bulk of the domain ,",

    ", we might question whether the instability found by has much relevance to neutron stars .",
    "the tearing instability requires rather specific conditions , and it is not clear that these would arise naturally .",
    "in fact , the particular choice of background magnetic field@xmath129 used by is rather artificial , and does not have an obvious analogue in spherical geometry . in their model , @xmath53 is intended to be the vertical coordinate , and therefore becomes the radial coordinate in spherical geometry .",

    "as in  [ sec : straight ] , we seek magnetic field  perturbations of the form ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) . in place of equation  ( [ eq:2d_linear ] )",
    "we now find @xmath174 as with equation  ( [ eq:2d_linear ] ) , a necessary condition for instability is that the first term on the right - hand side is negative for some range of @xmath53 .",
    "we note that the ( dimensionless ) electron velocity in the background state is @xmath175 , so instability requires the presence of electron shear @xcite . however , as in  [ sec : straight ] , this condition is only necessary , and not sufficient .",
    "a more stringent necessary condition can be obtained by the same process that led to equation  ( [ eq : bound ] ) , which this time leads to the result @xmath176 for perturbations with @xmath58 .",
    "so a necessary condition for instability is that @xmath177 for some range of @xmath53 .",
    "a similar result was obtained in ref .   for instabilities of a magneto - sonic wavefront .",
    "however , they were only able to demonstrate instability in the limit where the width of the front becomes much narrower than the wavelength of the perturbations .",
    "in fact , instabilities can be found under much more general conditions .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath178 for some positive constant @xmath179 .",
    "then the general solution of equation  ( [ eq : linear3d_full ] ) can be expressed in terms of jacobi polynomials : @xmath180 where the parameters @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 are related to @xmath84 , @xmath73 , and @xmath55 by the equations @xmath184 the solution is regular for any positive integer @xmath183 , which we may regard as the ( discrete ) vertical wavenumber . for given @xmath84 , @xmath73 , and @xmath183 , equations ( [ eq : jacobi1])([eq : jacobi3 ] ) implicitly provide a dispersion relation for @xmath55 . in general , perturbations with large wavenumbers @xmath185 are purely oscillatory , and perturbations with sufficiently small @xmath185 are either stable or unstable .",
    "the fastest growing unstable mode has @xmath186 , and is of the form @xmath187 where @xmath188 .",
    "we note that the fastest growing mode has @xmath58 ( i.e. ,  @xmath189 ) and is therefore non - oscillatory , in accordance with equation  ( [ eq : drive ] ) .      with the choice of profiles",
    "@xmath178 used above , the electron velocity profile is @xmath190 , and so the electron shear profile , @xmath191 , is either wider or narrower than the @xmath52 and @xmath172 profiles , depending on whether @xmath192 or @xmath193 .",
    "the fastest - growing eigenmode ( [ eq : eigenmode ] ) has a characteristic lengthscale @xmath194 in the @xmath51 and @xmath53 directions , which is always at least as wide as the @xmath52 and @xmath172 profiles , but can be wider or narrower than the @xmath195 profile , depending on @xmath179 .    by taking the asymptotic limits @xmath196 and @xmath197 we obtain two interesting limiting cases .",
    "more precisely , noting that @xmath198 as @xmath196 , we deduce from equation  ( [ eq : eigenmode ] ) that the fastest growing mode for the background with @xmath199 has @xmath200 . in this limit",
    "the electron velocity becomes a heaviside function of @xmath53 , but the lengthscale of the unstable mode remains finite .",
    "conversely , using @xmath201 as @xmath197 , we deduce that the fastest growing mode for the background with @xmath202 has @xmath203 . in this case",
    ", the unstable mode has finite amplitude throughout the domain , even where @xmath52 and @xmath172 are exponentially small .",
    "this case is somewhat pathological , however , because the electron velocity , @xmath204 , is unbounded , and the unstable modes form a continuous spectrum .",
    "it is tempting to think of the density - shear instability  as a trapped whistler mode that is advected and sheared by the electron flow , as described by equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) .",
    "whistler waves are right - hand polarized , so the displacement vector , @xmath130 , rotates in a sense that depends on the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "if the electron shear acts in opposition to this rotation , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : schematic ] , then the perturbation will be locally amplified .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : linear3d_full ] ) having negative sign .",
    "this is essentially the physical mechanism proposed by for their hall drift instability ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "is stretched by the electron velocity @xmath5 and rotated about the direction of the magnetic field  @xmath3 . as a result",
    "the initial perturbation is amplified . ]",
    "however , this physical picture of the instability is incomplete , because it makes no mention of the electron density gradient , which we have previously shown is necessary for instability .",
    "( nor can it explain the resistive tearing instability described in  [ sec : tearing ] , because it makes no mention of either resistivity or the magnetic null surface . )",
    "the role of the density gradient can be better understood by analogy with magneto - buoyancy instability in regular mhd . to that end , suppose we have a layer of magnetic field  @xmath170 in an mhd fluid with density @xmath171 and a gravitational potential @xmath205 .",
    "if we seek marginally stable ( @xmath108 ) perturbations of the form given by equation  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , then we eventually arrive at an equation @xcite @xmath206 ,      \\label{eq : hc87}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath208 is the sound speed . assuming that the background state is an adiabatic , hydrostatic balance between fluid pressure , magnetic pressure , and gravity , it follows that @xmath209 and so equation  ( [ eq : hc87 ] )",
    "can equivalently be written as @xmath210 .",
    "\\label{eq : hc872}\\ ] ] the necessary and sufficient condition for magneto - buoyancy instability is that this equation has bounded solutions .",
    "taking the limit @xmath211 , bounded solutions can always be obtained if the expression in square brackets is negative for some range of @xmath53 .",
    "there may also be bounded solutions in the opposite limit , @xmath212 , but the instability criterion is more stringent in that case . in this second limit ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : hc872 ] ) becomes almost identical to the density - shear instability  equation ( [ eq : linear3d_full ] ) with @xmath213 , except that it contains an additional term involving the ratio @xmath214 , which accounts for the expansion of rising fluid parcels .",
    "such a term does not arise in the density - shear instabilitybecause the fluid motions are subject to the constraint given by equation  ( [ eq : div_nxi ] ) , and so the effective sound speed in emhd is infinite .",
    "if such a constraint were imposed in the magneto - buoyancy problem , then the stability criterion for modes with @xmath58 would exactly match that for density - shear instability . indeed , in mhd this constraint is called the `` anelastic approximation '' @xcite , and so the density - shear instability  in emhd is closely analogous to the magneto - buoyancy instability in an anelastic fluid . this connection between emhd and anelastic mhd",
    "is the natural generalization of the results presented in  [ sec : lundquist ] , as we demonstrate in the next section .",
    "the ( diffusionless ) anelastic equations for a barotropic fluid are @xcite @xmath215 where @xmath5 is now the fluid velocity , @xmath7 is the fluid pressure , @xmath216 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath167 is the fluid density , which is a prescribed function of position in the anelastic approximation .",
    "we also make cowling s approximation , in which @xmath216 is taken to be a fixed function of position .",
    "suppose we have a steady , static equilibrium with @xmath217 and @xmath218 linear perturbations to this state , when expressed in terms of the lagrangian fluid perturbation @xmath130 , obey the equations @xmath219 where @xmath137 is the linear operator defined in equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) . as in ",
    "[ sec : lundquist ] , it can be shown that @xmath137 is a self - adjoint operator over the space of vector fields satisfying equation  ( [ eq : anelastic ] ) with respect to the inner product defined in equation  ( [ eq : brackets ] ) .",
    "it follows by an energy argument similar to that of ref .",
    "that the necessary and sufficient condition for instability in this system is that there exists a perturbation @xmath130 that satisfies equation  ( [ eq : anelastic ] ) and has @xmath220 .",
    "we now return to the emhd equations ( [ eq : xi ] ) and ( [ eq : div_nxi ] ) .",
    "we first note that the anelastic equilibrium condition ( [ eq : anelastic_equilibrium ] ) is also the emhd equilibrium condition , provided that we now interpret @xmath6 as the electron density , and @xmath216 as the electric potential . in this emhd equilibrium ,",
    "the lorentz force is balanced by a combination of the coulomb force and electron pressure , rather than by gravity and fluid pressure .",
    "it can be shown , in the same manner as in  [ sec : lundquist ] , that @xmath161 is still a conserved quantity in emhd with non - uniform density , and must therefore vanish for any unstable eigenmode .",
    "so the necessary and sufficient condition for instability in anelastic mhd is also ( but only ) a necessary condition for instability in emhd .",
    "finally , the generalization of equation  ( [ eq : lundquist ] ) in this case is @xmath221,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath158 is now defined such that @xmath222    this connection between emhd and anelastic mhd implies that for any instability in the former there must be a corresponding instability in the latter .",
    "the connection between the emhd density - shear instability  and the anelastic magneto - buoyancy instability is just one such example .",
    "most known instabilities in emhd require either finite conductivity or finite electron inertia . we have demonstrated the existence of a very different instability that",
    ", instead , requires electron density gradients and electron velocity shear",
    ". this density - shear instability  may play an important role in the evolution of magnetic fields  in the crusts of neutron stars , as well as in nearly - collisionless plasmas on scales smaller than the ion skin depth .",
    "the possibility of such an instability was first recognized in ref .   in the context of laboratory fusion devices , and has received very little attention in other contexts .",
    "the instability grows on the hall timescale , which is generally faster than the growth - rate of any resistive tearing instability , such as the so - called hall drift instability of .",
    "moreover , the density - shear instability  does not require peculiar magnetic field  configurations or boundary conditions to operate .",
    "it is highly likely that the instabilities observed in ref .",
    ", in a numerical model of a neutron star crust , include both the resistive tearing instability and the density - shear instability .",
    "although they interpreted all of their results in terms of the hall drift instability , in fact the instabilities they described clearly form two distinct families .",
    "one family occurs close to magnetic null surfaces and has a growth - rate that depends on resistivity , as we would expect for a resistive tearing instability .",
    "the other family occurs in the region where density and magnetic pressure gradients are parallel and has a growth - rate that is independent of resistivity , as we would expect for the density - shear instability .",
    "we have demonstrated a connection between the stability properties of emhd and those of incompressible / anelastic mhd , which shows the futility in seeking emhd instabilities for field configurations that are already known to be stable in mhd .",
    "the density - shear instability  is analogous to magneto - buoyancy instability in an anelastic fluid . under this analogy ,",
    "the emhd fluid , which has zero mass and finite charge , becomes an anelastic fluid , which has finite mass and zero charge , and the electric potential becomes the gravitational potential .",
    "we have not found any instabilities in ideal , inertia - less emhd with uniform density ; at present , it is not known whether any such instabilities exist .    by analogy with magneto - buoyancy instability in the solar interior @xcite",
    "we suggest that the density - shear instability  will greatly enhance the transport of magnetic flux from the superconducting core of a neutron star to its surface .",
    "this could explain the rapid decrease in the magnetic fieldstrengths observed in young neutron stars @xcite",
    ". this might also be the explanation for the magnetic spots suggested by ref .  .",
    "of course , the emhd equilibrium states and magnetic field  geometries considered in this paper are rather idealized , and the true situation in neutron star crusts is surely more complex",
    ". a full appreciation of the relevance of these results to neutron stars can only come from more realistic , direct numerical simulations , such as those of refs .  .",
