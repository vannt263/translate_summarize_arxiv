    "in this paper we investigate the problem of optimal attitude control of a 3-dimensional body which can be rotated around two fixed axes .",
    "the problem goes back to euler @xcite who proved in 1776 that an arbitrary rotation @xmath0 of a 3-dimensional body may be factored as @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) is a rotation in angle @xmath4 around @xmath5-axis ( resp .",
    "@xmath6-axis ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 are called the euler s angles .",
    "we could allow decompositions for @xmath0 with more factors : @xmath8 clearly we will get infinitely many such decompositions for a fixed element @xmath0 in the group @xmath9 of rotations . thus it is natural to pose the question of finding a decomposition ( [ eutwo ] ) that minimizes the total angle of rotation @xmath10 .",
    "it can happen that decompositions with more factors have a smaller total angle of rotation than the euler s decomposition ( [ eu ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this problem is not well - posed : for some @xmath0 an optimal decomposition ( [ eutwo ] ) does not exist . instead",
    ", the infimum of the total angle of rotation is attained as a limit on a sequence of decompositions ( [ eutwo ] ) with @xmath11 .",
    "we can overcome this difficulty by noting that @xmath12 hence it is natural to extend the set of controls from @xmath13 to @xmath14 @xmath15 . implementing a rotation @xmath16 corresponds to carrying out rotations around axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 simultaneously with the ratio @xmath17 of angular velocities .",
    "once we extend the control set , our optimization problem becomes well - posed and for every @xmath18 there is an optimal decomposition with a finite number of factors .",
    "we study this problem in a more general setting , where we allow an arbitrary angle @xmath19 between the axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we also introduce a more general cost function to be minimized , where a rotation in angle @xmath4 around @xmath6-axis has the same cost as a rotation around @xmath5-axis in angle @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "we solve the optimization problem in this greater generality and determine possible patterns for the optimal decompositions .",
    "each of these patterns has ( at most ) 3 independent time parameters , and it is fairly easy to find numerically the decompositions of a given element @xmath18 according to each pattern .",
    "this produces a finite number of decompositions and we can immediately see which one of them is optimal .",
    "it happens that our optimization problem has a bifurcation at @xmath22 .",
    "for the cases @xmath23 and @xmath24 we get different lists of optimal patterns .",
    "there are also special cases when @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "let us present the list of optimal patterns in case when the axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 are perpendicular to each other and @xmath27 .",
    "since in this case the problem is symmetric with respect to the dihedral group of order @xmath28 , generated by transformations @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the list of patterns will also be symmetric with respect to this group .",
    "we denote this group of @xmath28 symmetries by @xmath32 and use it to present the list of patterns in a more compact form .",
    "let the angle between the axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 be @xmath33 and let @xmath27 . for an element @xmath18",
    "there is an optimal decomposition with @xmath34 of one of the following types : @xmath35 and symmetric to these under the group of transformations @xmath32 .",
    "suppose we would like to decompose a rotation @xmath36 as a product of rotations around @xmath5- and @xmath6-axes , where @xmath37 is the standard orthogonal basis of @xmath38 .",
    "the pattern for the optimal decompositions will depend on the value of @xmath4 . if @xmath39 then the following decomposition realizes the minimum of the total rotation angle : @xmath40 for @xmath41 the euler s decomposition ( [ eu ] ) becomes optimal : @xmath42 when @xmath43 both patterns are optimal .",
    "for @xmath44 the optimal decompositions may be obtained by switching @xmath5 with @xmath6 in the above expressions .    in case when the axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 are perpendicular to each other and @xmath25 ( meaning that rotations around @xmath6-axis have zero cost ) ,",
    "the optimal decompositions are precisely those described by euler ( [ eu ] ) .    in 2009",
    "nasa launched a space telescope kepler with a mission of finding planets outside the solar system .",
    "this spacecraft was placed in an orbit around the sun . to take images of stars ,",
    "the telescope needs to be pointed in the target direction , with its solar panels facing the sun .",
    "the attitude control of kepler is done with reaction wheels , which are heavy disks mounted on electric motors .",
    "once the reaction wheel is turned , the spacecraft will turn around the same axis in the opposite direction due to the angular momentum conservation law .",
    "if we have three reaction wheels with linearly independent axes , by rotating them simultaneously with appropriate relative angular velocities , we can implement a continuous rotation of the spacecraft around an arbitrary axis . for redundancy ,",
    "kepler was equipped with four reaction wheels with their axes in a tetrahedral configuration , so that any three of them could provide an efficient attitude control .",
    "however by may 2013 , two of the four reaction wheels failed , leaving kepler with just two available axes of rotation @xcite .",
    "the results of our paper provide optimal methods for attitude control with two rotation axes , like in situation with the kepler space telescope .",
    "this paper builds on our previous work @xcite , where we studied a similar problem for @xmath45 , also with two available controls , but with a restriction that only a positive time evolution is allowed . that paper was motivated by the applications to quantum control in a 1-qubit system .",
    "in the present paper we use the geometric control theory @xcite , which is an adaptation of the pontryagin s maximum principle to the setting of lie groups .",
    "the maximum principle provides only necessary conditions for optimality , which need not be sufficient . in section 3",
    "we identify decompositions that satisfy the necessary conditions of the pontryagin s maximum principle .",
    "then we go into a more detailed analysis in section 4 by showing that decompositions with a large number of factors are not optimal , even when they satisfy the conditions of the maximum principle .",
    "our main results are stated in theorems [ czero ]  [ meq ] at the end of the next section .",

    "more generally , we may assign cost to each generator @xmath60 and minimize the total cost in ( [ dec ] ) .",
    "introduction of the cost parameters may be warranted in case when the body that we control has unequal momenta of inertia with respect to the axes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , thus making it easier to rotate it around one of the axes .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that @xmath65 and renormalize the cost function by fixing @xmath66 , @xmath67 with @xmath21 .    for the rest of the paper we fix two non - proportional vectors @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "an important parameter is the angle @xmath70 between these vectors . without loss of generality",

    "let @xmath75 be a vector perpendicular to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "it could happen that the infimum of cost is not attained on any particular decomposition ( [ dec ] ) , but rather as a limit on a sequence of such decompositions with @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that we can overcome this difficulty by enlarging the set of generators to be @xmath79    note that rotations corresponding to elements of @xmath80 can be realized as limits of products of rotations with axes @xmath81 : @xmath82 from the point of view of the attitude control , this corresponds to turning on controls @xmath5 and @xmath6 simultaneously with intensities @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "we extend the definition of the cost function in such a way that the cost of both sides of ( [ explim ] ) is the same : @xmath85    our goal is to solve the following    * problem 1 .",

    "there will be also a special case when @xmath25",
    ".    we will give the solution of the above optimal control problem by specifying the patterns of optimal decomposition ( [ dec ] ) .",
    "we begin with some elementary observations .",
