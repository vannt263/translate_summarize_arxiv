    "in optical communication systems , information is often carried by states with gaussian statistics ; the coherent state is a simple and very important example .",
    "the processing of these states in the quantum domain is now a major concern toward attaining ultimate capacity of bosonic channels @xcite , and also the construction of quantum networks and computers @xcite . toward these applications , it is important to generate and manipulate superpositions of pure gaussian states .",
    "in fact , certain types of such superposition states can be used as ancillary states to build up a universal set of operations to construct an arbitrary processor  @xcite .",
    "( see also ref  @xcite for its experimental perspectives . )",
    "these states are essentially non - gaussian states , and are easily destroyed even by a small amount of losses . in practice , it is not easy to prepare in labs the state that preserves enough purity and useful non - gaussian properties",
    ". therefore , one needs to develop the methods how to stabilize and/or purify such states .",
    "a simple and more experimentally feasible example is a superposition of two coherent states with small amplitudes .",
    "such a state can be conditionally generated from a squeezed vacuum ( gaussian state ) by using the photon number measurement  @xcite .",
    "recently , a proof - of - principle experiment of this idea was successfully presented in ref  @xcite , where an on / off - type detector ( which clicks upon the arrival of a photon ) was used rather than a photon number resolving detector .",
    "there is , however , still a distance between the observed state and the ideal one due to various losses .    in this paper , we develop a feasible scheme to purify such coherent superposition states ( csss ) that has undergone linear dissipation .",
    "we consider a specific scenario of the purification , but it meets the current experimental situations and is based only on the use of a single beam splitter and a single homodyne detector , which probabilistically selects out favourable events .",
    "the scenario we treat is the following ; consider a css of an equal superposition of two distinct coherent states , @xmath0 , where the amplitude @xmath1 and the phase @xmath2 are a priori known and @xmath1 is relatively small .",
    "this state decoheres into a mixed state by the linear loss and represented by a classical mixture of a css and two coherent states .",
    "our task is then to amplify the probability of the css as efficiently as possible .",
    "the css itself has also been discussed as a resource of various optical quantum information processing protocols @xcite . as a related topic to our study , glancy _ et al . _",
    "have proposed a method to restore a css , whose weights and phase information of the superposition are unknown , by applying a three - bit quantum error correcting code @xcite .",
    "however , this proposal requires almost perfect photon number resolving detectors and pure csss as ancillary states . in our study",
    "we make no use of non - gaussian ancillary states in the purifaction method .",
    "the schematic of our proposal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "a fraction of the input state is tapped off by a beam splitter and subsequently measured with a homodyne detector . from the measurement outcomes we try to distinguish the css from the mixture of coherent states through the differences of their wave functions .",
    "based on the success of this estimation , the coherence of the css is retrieved through selection of favourable events .",
    "we show that homodyne measurement is one of the optimal measurements for the most efficient purification given such a simple setup .    using the purification protocol in fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] , the amplitude of the coherent state components in the ccs is inevitably degraded due to the conditional selection of events .",
    "so we then address the possibility to recover the amplitude by using the css amplification scheme proposed in refs @xcite , where it has been shown that a css with small amplitudes of its constituents is equivalently generated by squeezing a single photon state and the amplitudes can be amplified using linear optics and on / off detectors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] , the influence of linear dissipation to the css is briefly reviewed . in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "we discuss the purification scheme in general terms without specifying the exact measurement strategy applied to the tapped off state . in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we consider the example where a homodyne detector is used and show that it is one of the optimal measurement strategies .",
    "in section [ sec:5 ] , we discuss the amplification of css using two csss that has suffered from linear loss , and finally in section [ sec:6 ] we conclude .    . ]",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the evolution of css s under linear dissipation .",
    "let us first define a superposition of two coherent states ( css ) with the amplitudes @xmath3 and the relative phase @xmath2 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 we assume @xmath6 to be real without loss of generality .    in practice ,",
    "the most dominant loss in optical channels is due to a linear interaction between the signal mode and the vacuum environment .",
    "this is modeled by coupling the signal mode to the environment , letting them evolve for some time and finally trace out the states of the environment .",

    "the transmission of the environment is denoted by @xmath12 and thus the linear loss is given by @xmath13 .",

    "the fraction of the original state in this mixed state is given by @xmath18 as expected , the linear lossy interaction with the environment transforms the original pure css state into a classical mixture .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a method by which the decohered state can be probabilistically purified to produce a smaller number of states with higher purity , or in other words ; the aim is to increase the value of @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we note that the purity defined by @xmath20 $ ] is not a suitable figure of merit for our purpose .",
    "one can easily show that , for the mixed css in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decohered_cat ] ) , a smaller amplitude gives a higher purity of the state even for small @xmath19 .",
    "this is because such a state is close to a vacuum state which is completely pure .",
    "however , it is obvious that it does not mean the state is close to a pure css .",
    "our proposed scheme for probabilistic purification of csss is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the state under interrogation is mixed with the vacuum at a beam splitter with the transmission coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "the reflected beam is subsequently measured using a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) generally described by a set of positive operators @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "depending on the outcome of this measurement , the transmitted state is probabilistically purified : if the outcomes fall within a certain detection range , the transmitted state is purified , otherwise the state turns out to be worse and is discarded .",
    "let us first describe the function of the purification scheme when an already pure css @xmath24 is injected into it . in this case",
    ", the output of the beam splitter ( described by the unitary operator @xmath25 ) is given by the entangled state @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the reflectivity of the beam splitter .",
    "if we now consider only one output and trace out the other , the pure css is transformed into a mixed state as a result of the coupling to the vacuum environment .",
    "the purification protocol now works by making a measurement on the `` environmental '' mode ( mode b ) and selecting the outcomes that map @xmath28 back onto a pure css at the output .",
    "it implies that the measurement outcomes for successful events have to satisfy @xmath29 where the superscript @xmath30 denotes the successful events . the unnormalized conditional output for such outcomes is given by @xmath31 ) , it is possible to recover the purity of the input css .",
    "let us now consider the purification of a decohered css .",
    "the input to the purifier is now the mixture @xmath32 the reflected part of the state is measured using the above mentioned povm and events corresponding to condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) are selected .",
    "the resulting density operator of the output state conditioned on this measurement is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34   \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\left|\\langle\\pi_j^s|\\sqrt{r}\\alpha\\rangle\\right|^2   \\frac{1+\\cos(\\varphi+\\theta_j ) \\ , e^{-2t\\alpha^2 } } { 1+\\cos\\varphi \\ , e^{-2\\alpha^2 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath35   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left|\\langle\\pi_j^s|\\sqrt{r}\\alpha\\rangle\\right|^2    \\label{eq : det_probability_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] correspond to the probability distributions for detecting the outcomes @xmath36 in the states @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "as a consequence , one finds the fraction of the css after the purification as @xmath39 the condition for successful purification @xmath40 is then given by @xmath41 the maximum purification efficiency is achieved when @xmath42 is minimized .",
    "there are two free parameters controlling the magnitude of this fraction , namely @xmath43 and @xmath21 .",
    "first we note that the phase @xmath43 is optimized , that is @xmath42 is minimized when @xmath44 .",
    "second , it is clear that the fraction ( [ eq : purif_codition ] ) decreases with decreasing transmissions @xmath21 .",
    "this , on the other hand , means that the amplitude of the css is decreasing .",
    "therefore , there is a trade - off between the efficiency of the purification protocol and the amplitude of the purified css .",
    "since large amplitude csss are desired for many applications , we consider the possibility of amplifying the degraded css in sec .  v.",
    "the optimal povm for the purification protocol is therefore the one that obeys eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) and simultaneously minimizes the fraction ( [ eq : purif_codition ] ) by satisfying the constraint @xmath45 .",
    "these conditions provide a nice flexibility to chose among different measurement strategies .",
    "two well known measurement strategies that satisfy the requirements are photon number resolving detectors and homodyne detectors .",
    "if however the photon number resolving detector is used to execute the purification protocol , successful demonstration will only be obtained if the phase between the coherent state components in the css , is @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , these detectors are experimentally very challenging to construct and thus , to date , they are not an integral part of the standard lab .    fortunately , homodyne detectors ( which have matured much further than photon number resolving detectors ) also meet the requirements for successful purification .",
    "in fact by using homodyne detectors there are no restrictions on the phase @xmath2 . in the following section we investigate in greater details the purification of css using homodyne detection .",
    "a homodyne detector measures a quadrature of the electromagnetic field , with the specific quadratures being determined by the phase , @xmath48 , of the intrinsic local oscillator .",
    "it is mathematically described by an operator @xmath49 which projects the state onto a continuous set of quadrature eigenstates @xmath50 with @xmath48 denoting the quadrature phase .",
    "specific and important examples are the position and momentum eigenstates corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the probability amplitude associated with the detection of a quadrature eigenvalue , @xmath53 , from the coherent state @xmath54 by homodyne detection is given by @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the necessary condition for our purification scheme to work as quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) is fulfilled when @xmath52 , that is when the momentum eigenstate is measured . in that case",

    ", these distinct differences between the probability distributions enable the purification protocol : it succeeds when the absolute quadrature value falls within a certain threshold for @xmath66 and outside a certain threshold for @xmath72 , since in these regions the probability for a css to occur is larger than the probability for @xmath63 to occur .",
