    "we present an energy - dependent lorentz covariant parameterization of the on - shell nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering matrix at incident laboratory kinetic energies ranging from 50 to 200  mev .",
    "in particular , we focus on the relativistic horowitz - love - franey ( hlf ) model @xcite which parameterizes the nn scattering amplitudes as a number of yukawa - type meson - exchange terms .    the original hlf model parameterized @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering amplitudes at discrete energies of 135 , 200 and 400  mev @xcite .",
    "a drawback of the initial representation was that separate fits were performed at each energy resulting in non - systematic and unphysical trends in the various model parameters as a function of energy .",
    "this was also undesirable in the sense that it hindered meaningful comparisons of the off - shell properties of the nn scattering matrix at different energies .",
    "this problem was subsequently addressed by maxwell who developed energy - dependent parameterizations of the nn scattering amplitudes for two energy ranges , namely 200 - 500  mev @xcite and 500 - 800  mev @xcite . since several experiments at future radioactive ion beam facilities",
    "will be conducted at nucleon energies lower than 200  mev , it is essential to extend the hlf model to lower energies so as to generate reliable input for nuclear reaction models",
    ".    an attractive feature of hlf model is the existence of a simple relationship  lacking in conventional nonrelativistic models  between the lorentz invariant nn scattering amplitudes and mesons mediating the interaction .",
    "moreover , this model has a physical basis in the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) picture , since the values of the real meson - nucleon coupling constants ( at energies higher than 200  mev ) are similar to those arising from more sophisticated obe models @xcite .",
    "in addition to being employed as the basic nn interaction driving the dominant reaction mechanism in several relativistic scattering models of nucleon - induced reactions , the hlf model has also been applied to extract relativistic microscopic optical potentials @xcite for studying elastic proton scattering from stable nuclei , as well as for generating scattering wave functions for evaluating transition matrix elements in various relativistic distorted wave models @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the latter microscopic optical potentials are generated by folding the hlf @xmath2-matrix with the relevant relativistic mean field lorentz densities via the so - called @xmath3-approximation .",
    "indeed , one of the triumphs of this folding procedure is that the microscopic potentials , for energies from 200 to 400  mev , are virtually identical to the corresponding global phenomenological dirac optical potentials , which have been shown to provide excellent quantitative predictions of scattering observables for elastic proton scattering from spin - zero stable nuclei ranging from @xmath4c to @xmath5pb and for incident energies between 20 and 1040  mev @xcite .",
    "one of the frontier areas of research in nuclear physics is to understand the properties of nuclei far from the beta - stability line , the so - called exotic or unstable nuclei .",
    "these studies provide insight into the nuclear processes that underlie the evolution of the stars and the origin of the elements in the cosmos . indeed , a number of radioactive ion beam facilities are currently under construction to study short - lived rare isotopes .",
    "in particular , there are plans to study exclusive proton - induced proton - knockout reactions ( using inverse kinematics ) at facilities such as riken and gsi for both neutron- and proton - rich nuclei at energies lower than 200  mev per nucleon . for the eventual interpretation of these data",
    "it is essential to have reliable optical potentials .",
    "existing global dirac optical potentials have been constrained to reproduce elastic proton scattering from stable nuclei @xcite , and hence there is no reason to believe that these potentials can be reliably extrapolated for studies of unstable nuclei . on the other hand , one can readily extend the above - mentioned folding procedure to calculate scattering potentials for proton - induced reactions on exotic nuclei .",
    "moreover , the successful application of the relativistic @xmath6 approximation to describe elastic proton scattering from stable nuclei , gives one confidence in extending this approach to study proton scattering on exotic nuclei .",
    "two basic ingredients underly the realization of these folding potentials , namely a suitable analytical representation for the nn interaction in the energy range of interest , as well as an appropriate relativistic model of nuclear structure @xcite . several relativistic mean",
    "field nuclear structure models are currently being developed for studying the structure of unstable nuclei @xcite . in this paper , however , we focus on developing a hlf - type parameterization of the nn scattering amplitudes at energies lower than 200  mev .",
    "the generation of the corresponding microscopic optical potentials will be considered in a future paper , in which pauli blocking corrections and nuclear medium modifications to the nn interaction are expected to be significant and will be taken into account  @xcite .",

    "the most general parametrization of the nonrelativistic on - shell elastic nn scattering matrix  consistent with rotational , parity , time - reversal and isospin invariance  is completely determined by five complex scattering amplitudes .",
    "depending on the specific application of interest , the nn scattering matrix can be recast into several distinct , but equivalent , five - term representations , one of which is the so - called bystricky parameterization @xcite , namely : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes a kronecker product , @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to the usual pauli spin matrices associated with the projectile and target nucleons , 1 and 2 respectively , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the respective @xmath13 unit matrices , and the basis vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are defined as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the initial and final momenta of the interacting nucleons in the nn centre - of - mass frame .",

    "<S> for laboratory kinetic energies between 50 and 200  mev , we focus on generating an energy - dependent lorentz covariant parameterization of the on - shell nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering amplitudes in terms of a number of yukawa - type meson exchanges in first - order born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this parameterization provides a good description of nn scattering observables in the energy range of interest , and can also be successfully extrapolated to energies between 40 and 300  mev . </S>"
