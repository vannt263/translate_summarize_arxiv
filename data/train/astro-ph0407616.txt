    "the paradigm of statistically stationary isotropic turbulence put forward by kolmogorov is based on the balance between energy injection and dissipation in equilibrium , regardless of the mechanism of dissipation .",
    "this implies the well - known scaling relation @xcite @xmath3 for the turbulence energy spectrum in the inertial subrange of wave numbers @xmath4 .",
    "the universality of kolmogorov scaling was confirmed in many laboratory experiments and three - dimensional numerical simulations @xcite . the mean rate of dissipation @xmath5 is determined by integral length and velocity scales , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , which are related to the properties of energy injection into the flow .",
    "normalising @xmath5 in terms of these characteristic scales , a dimensionless quantity is obtained : @xmath8 it is customary to specify the dimensionless rate of dissipation in terms of the similarity parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the exact definition of @xmath10 is given in section  [ sc : rate_diss ] .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to infer the value of @xmath10 either from laboratory measurements or numerical simulations of turbulent flows .",
    "it appears that @xmath11 is generally of the order unity .",
    "particularly , a universal value of about @xmath12 for statistically stationary isotropic turbulence at sufficiently high reynolds number has emerged over the last decade @xcite . however , virtually all of the numerical estimates of @xmath10 have been obtained from simulations of incompressible turbulence so far . only very recently ,",
    "first results from simulations of compressible flows with higher - order finite difference methods have become available and , actually , are in excellent agreement with previously reported values @xcite .",
    "we will extend this approach and present calculations of the instantaneous rate of dissipation from the energy budget in numerical simulations of forced compressible turbulence up to mach numbers of the order unity .",
    "moreover , the whole range of developing , steady and decaying turbulence is investigated . in order to make parameter studies feasible , we chose a rather moderate resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "the simulations we have performed also differ in other aspects from those cited above .",
    "firstly , this work was motivated by the astrophysical problem of turbulent deflagration in degenerate stars .",
    "thus , both the equation of state and the absolute values of physical quantities differ greatly from anything that is encountered in engineering or in the atmospheric sciences @xcite . in terms of dimensionless quantities , however , no significant deviations from turbulence in ideal gas are found .",
    "apart from that , we use a high - order godunov scheme , namely , the piece - wise parabolic method ( ppm ) , which applies to fully compressible flows and , in fact , introduces _ numerical dissipation _ @xcite .",
    "of course , the question arises , whether the action of numerical dissipation properly mimics the effect of navier - stokes viscous dissipation in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) or the action of subgrid scale turbulence stresses in large - eddy simulations ( les ) @xcite .",
    "one can not reasonably expect that the local rate of dissipation in the former case or the energy transfer toward unresolved scale in the latter case is exactly matched by the dissipative effects of the ppm .",
    "however , at sufficiently high resolution , a nearly inertial range of scales will emerge , in which the flow is dominated by the dynamics of the turbulence cascade and , hence , more or less independent of the actual dissipation mechanism .",
    "in addition , if statistical properties such as the value of @xmath10 or the kolmogorov constant @xmath14 were reproduced correctly in simulations of turbulence with the ppm , then the evolution of mean quantities and basic structural features of the computed flow should be in accordance with more accurate methods with an explicit treatment of dissipation .",
    "indeed , there are several numerical results in support of this point of view @xcite , and we will attempt to strengthen the case for the ppm in this article .    particularly , we computed turbulence energy spectrum functions from selected flow realisations .",
    "the spectra for fully developed turbulence reveal a pile - up of kinetic energy near the wave number of maximum dissipation .",
    "this is known under the name _ bottleneck effect _ and was found in numerous numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the bottleneck is believed to be a genuine feature of isotropic turbulence and can be attributed to the partial suppression of non - linear turbulent interactions under the influence of viscous dissipation @xcite .",
    "based on the turbulence energy spectra , we propose the definition of a characteristic length scale @xmath2 of a presumed implicit filter which is equivalent to smoothing effect of the ppm . if the equations of motion are solved with spectral methods , then @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the length scale of the numerical grid in physical space .",
    "for finite volume methods , however , the smoothing of velocity fluctuations due to numerical dissipation on the smallest resolved length scales @xmath17 implies @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is expected to assume a valuer larger than unity .",
    "furthermore , values for the dimensionless rate of dissipation  [ eq : eps_tilde ] were calculated from the growth rate of the internal energy corrected for compressibility effects . combining values of the numerical dissipation rate and the effective length scale @xmath2 , respectively ,",
    "it was possible to calculate the smagorinsky constant , assuming the the numerical dissipation would be statistically equivalent to the action of a smagorinsky subgrid scale model .    in section  [ sc : isoturb ]",
    ", we will outline the forcing scheme , the simulation parameters and the equation of state in our simulations .",
    "the evaluation of the rate of dissipation is presented in section  [ sc : rate_diss ] , the computation of turbulence energy spectra in section  [ sc : spectrum ] and , finally , dissipation length scales are discussed in section  [ sc : diss_length ] .",
    "the dynamics of forced turbulence in compressible fluids is determined by the following set of conservation laws in combination with the equation of state @xcite : @xmath20 the field @xmath21 is called the _ driving force _ and may be any mechanical force acting upon the fluid and thereby supplying energy to the flow .",
    "the term @xmath22 in the momentum equation is the viscous force per unit volume . in the case of navier - stokes turbulence ,",
    "the viscous stress tensor @xmath23 is proportional to the local strain of the velocity field : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath26 is the _ microscopic viscosity _ of the fluid .    according to the landau criterion @xcite , the range of dynamically relevant length scales in a turbulent flow is of the order @xmath27 , where @xmath6 is the _ integral length scale _ associated with the spatial variation of the driving force , and @xmath28 , which is called the _ kolmogorov scale _ , is a characteristic length scale associated with viscous dissipation .",
    "if the reynolds number @xmath29 for a flow of characteristic velocity @xmath7 is large enough , the range of dynamically relevant length scales will become computationally intractable .",
    "then the common approach is to run a les which resolves only the largest scales and invokes some model for turbulence on smaller scales . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been suggested to let merely the dissipative effect of a finite - volume scheme smooth out the flow on length scales just above the numerical cutoff and dispose of accumulating kinetic energy @xcite . in particular , this assumption was put forward and exhaustively tested for the _ piece - wise parabolic method _ ( ppm ) @xcite .",
    "we chose to follow this approach and adopted the ppm for simulations of forced isotropic turbulence . in order to produce turbulence , a random driving force",
    "is applied @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the force field is determined by a three - component _ ornstein - uhlenbeck _ process in spectral space @xcite , which corresponds to the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) for the fourier transform @xmath30 : @xmath31 the discretisation in physical space induces a discrete spectrum of modes associated with the wave vectors @xmath32 .",
    "gaussian random increments are introduced by the three - component _ wiener process _ @xmath33 and are projected by means of the symmetric operator @xmath34 for the spectral weight @xmath35 , the physical force field becomes purely _ solenoidal _ , i.  e. , divergence - free .",
    "choosing @xmath36 , _ dilatational _ components are generated which compress or rarify the fluid .",
    "the spectral profile of the driving force is determined by the variance @xmath37 .",
    "we use a symmetric quadratic function centred at the wave number @xmath38 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "all modes of the force vanish identically .",
    "the integral length scale @xmath6 is defined by @xmath40 .",
    "once @xmath41 is normalised , the asymptotic rms amplitude of the stochastic driving force depends on @xmath42 and the weight @xmath43 only : @xmath44 the linear drift term in the sde  ( [ eq : stirr_mode_evol ] ) causes any information about the initial conditions to decay exponentially over the characteristic time @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the computed flow will evolve towards a statistically stationary state which becomes asymptotically independent of the initial state . in this regime ,",
    "the properties of the flow are determined by the three parameters @xmath6 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the force magnitude @xmath42 is conveniently expressed as @xmath46 , where the characteristic velocity @xmath7 is about the root mean square velocity in the fully developed flow , and for the integral time scale we naturally set @xmath47 .    given the astrophysical background of our work , we employed the equation of state ( eos ) of a degenerate electron gas .",
    "degeneracy is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in the limit of vanishing temperature which , for example , is encountered in so - called white dwarfs .",
    "this kind of stellar remnant emanates from the burnout of stars comparable in mass to our sun @xcite . in white dwarf matter",
    ", the electrons are not bound to nuclei . while the latter are non - degenerate and obey the ideal gas law , each electron assumes more or less its lowest possible energy state .",
    "thus , the electrons follow the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "one can show that the resulting degeneracy pressure of the electron gas dominates over the residual thermal pressure of all particles in the interior of a white dwarf @xcite . in this case , the equation of state is approximately given by @xmath48 independent of the temperature , provided that the mass density is less than the critical density @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the mass of the proton and @xmath51 is the compton wave length of the electron . at higher densities , the electrons become relativistic and the isentropic exponent approaches @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "in fact , a realistic eos which accounts for contributions from degenerate electrons , non - degenerate nuclei , photons and pair production over a wide range of densities and temperatures was used in the simulations we performed .",
    "this eos can not be expressed in analytical form and must be evaluated numerically @xcite .",
    "the following initial conditions were chosen in all but one case : @xmath53 for the simulation with the lowest mach number , the initial mass density is larger by a factor @xmath54 than the above value .",
    "in addition to @xmath55 , the spectral weight @xmath43 of the driving force , the characteristic velocity @xmath7 and the integral times scale @xmath45 as well as supplementary simulation parameters are listed in table  [ tb : dns ] .",
    "the spectrum of the driving force is determined by the wave number @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ratio of the domain size @xmath58 to the integral length @xmath6 .",
    "we used a grid of @xmath13 cells for each simulation , and an integral length @xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to a numerical resolution of @xmath60 .",
    ".chosen values for basic simulation parameters , the time of the onset of decay @xmath61 and the end of each simulation @xmath62 , as well as the total number of time steps @xmath63 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,<,^,^,>,^ \" , ]",
    "in the case of isotropic turbulence , the sum over all squared fourier modes of the velocity field can be expressed as an integral over a function of the wave number only : @xmath64 here the wave number is written in dimensionless form as @xmath65 .",
    "the function @xmath66 is called the _ energy spectrum function_. for a discrete spectrum of modes , @xmath67 is a generalised function which is defined by : @xmath68.\\ ] ] for the numerical evaluation , we define an approximation to @xmath67 by summing over wave number bins @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "this yields the discrete set of numbers @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the average kinetic energy of all modes in the corresponding wave number bin : @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the statistical weight of the @xmath75th wave number bin , i.  e. , the number of cells in fourier space with wavenumber @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "a number of spectra were computed from flow realisations at selected times .",
    "some of these spectra are shown in figures  [ fg : spect100 ] , [ fg : spect075 ] and  [ fg : spect020 ] .",
    "for the calculation of the discrete spectrum function as given by definition  ( [ eq : disc_spect ] ) , a coarse equidistant wave number mesh was used in the energy containing range , @xmath77 , and a logarithmic mesh with narrow bins for the larger wave numbers .",
    "the panels on the top of figure  [ fg : spect100 ] show , from left to right , the discrete energy spectrum function @xmath78 at representative stages for the simulation with @xmath79 and characteristic mach number @xmath80 .",
    "the panel on the very left shows a spectrum in the production phase .",
    "the middle panel corresponds to developed turbulence , and the panel on the very right shows a spectrum for decaying turbulence .",
    "one can clearly see the larger energy contents at high wave numbers in the case of developed turbulence and the lower overall energy budget in the decay regime .",
    "also plotted are the longitudinal and transversal spectrum functions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "@xmath81 corresponds to the dilatational ( rotation - free ) components of the flow and @xmath82 to the solenoidal ( divergence - free ) components . from the plots in figure  [ fg : spect100 ]",
    ", it becomes apparent that the longitudinal energy fraction at higher wave numbers decays faster in comparison to the transversal fraction .",
    "the energy in the longitudinal components at small wave numbers , on the other hand , remains almost constant .     and",
    "@xmath79 . in the bottom panels ,",
    "the compensated spectrum functions corresponding to the transversal component are plotted . ]    from the kolmogorov spectrum function  ( [ eq : kolmogrv ] ) , it follows that @xmath83 is approximately constant in the inertial subrange of wave numbers .",
    "this suggests the definition of a _ compensated spectrum function _",
    ", @xmath84^{-2/3 }    ( \\alpha\\tilde{k}_{n})^{5/3}\\tilde{e}_{n}^{\\perp}(t),\\ ] ] as an indicator of kolmogorov scaling .",
    "note that only the transversal part of the energy spectrum is compensated , because it is the incompressible fraction of turbulence energy which _ a priori _ fulfils kolmogorov scaling .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath85 , the values of @xmath86 listed in the tables  [ tb : num_nrsl ] , [ tb : num_nrh75 ] and  [ tb : num_nrh20 ] were substituted for the dimensionless mean rate of dissipation in equation  ( [ eq : comps_spect ] ) .",
    "the resulting plots of the compensated spectrum functions for @xmath79 are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fg : spect100 ] .",
    "in particular , the graph of @xmath87 for @xmath88 verifies the existence of a narrow window of wave numbers in the vicinity of @xmath89 , in which kolmogorov scaling with @xmath1 applies within the bounds set by the numerical uncertainty .",
    "it is noteworthy that this value is very close to results obtained from other numerical simulations , especially , those with higher resolution @xcite .",
    "however , the kolmogorov constant inferred from our simulations might be systematically too large , because of the lack of isotropy for wave numbers close to the energy - containing subrange @xcite .",
    "moreover , the portion of the compensated spectrum function @xmath90 in the range of dimensionless wave numbers between @xmath91 and about @xmath92 appears to be consistent with a modification of the kolmogorov exponent by @xmath93 , which has recently been inferred from a dns with extremely high resolution @xcite .     and @xmath94 .",
    "]     and @xmath95 . ]",
    "basically the same results hold for the simulation with higher characteristic mach number , @xmath96 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the sample spectra shown in figure  [ fg : spect075 ] are very similar in shape compared to those in figure  [ fg : spect100 ] , except for the smaller gap between the total and the longitudinal energy spectrum functions . as for the case",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath97 , differences can evidently be seen in figure  [ fg : spect020 ] . at early time , the flow is dominated by large shock waves and most of the energy is contained in longitudinal modes .",
    "this is illustrated by the plot of the energy spectrum functions at time @xmath98 .",
    "the scaling deviates markedly from the kolmogorov law .",
    "in particular , the longitudinal component @xmath99 clearly obeys a power law with exponent @xmath100 and the transversal component is falling off even steeper . from statistics of the velocity field shown in figure  [ fg : stat3d020 ] , a transition to the regime of solenoidal turbulent flow around @xmath101 can be discerned @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the small - scale dynamics is eventually dominated by turbulent vortices as in the case of subsonic turbulence , and the transversal component of the energy spectrum function is more or less kolmogorovian .",
    "however , we have a somewhat smaller value of the kolmogorov constant , @xmath102 , at time @xmath103 ( see the middle panels in figure  [ fg : spect020 ] ) .    for developed turbulence ,",
    "there is a pronounced maximum of the compensated spectrum function at @xmath104 corresponding to a flattening of the energy spectrum in comparison to the kolmogorov law .",
    "this so - called _ bottleneck effect _",
    "has actually been observed in various numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the anomalous bottleneck scaling is attributed to dynamical peculiarities on scales which are significantly influenced by dissipation .",
    "for example , experimental data indicate a @xmath105 power law behaviour of the energy spectrum function in the vicinity of the wave number of maximum dissipation @xcite .",
    "a theoretical explanation of the bottleneck effect on grounds of the non - linear turbulent transfer was suggested too @xcite .",
    "the peak of @xmath106 close to the wave number @xmath104 is more pronounced than in simulations of incompressible turbulence with spectral methods .",
    "for instance , the peak value in the middle panels of the figures  [ fg : spect100 ] and  [ fg : spect075 ] is about @xmath107 , whereas the peaks of the compensated spectra in @xcite are not much higher than @xmath108 .",
    "the width of the bottleneck , on the other hand , is about one decade in wave number space in all cases . remarkably , the properties of the bottleneck we observe are very similar to what is found in turbulence simulations with hyperviscosity @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that the numerical viscosity of the ppm acts like a hyperviscosity , at least as far as the spectral distribution of turbulence energy is concerned .",
    "one can regard the action of numerical dissipation as being equivalent to an _ implicit filter _ smoothing the flow on a certain length scale , say , @xmath2 .",
    "fourier modes of wave number larger than @xmath109 are suppressed .",
    "it has already been pointed out in section  [ sc : rate_diss ] that the ratio @xmath110 is of particular interest for subgrid scale models , which depend on the reliable specification of the cutoff length . in combination with a finite - volume method ,",
    "the cutoff length may very well be different form the grid resolution @xmath16 .",
    "although the common point of view holds that it is not sensible to apply a subgrid scale model in combination with dissipative schemes such as the ppm , subgrid scale models are used in some applications without active coupling to the resolved flow .",
    "a particular example is the modelling of turbulent combustion , where the subgrid scale energy is treated as a passive scalar and is used as input for a turbulent flame speed model @xcite .",
    "the determination of the effective length scale @xmath2 for the ppm makes use of the notion of a characteristic filter scale @xcite . for a one - dimensional filter of explicitly known functional form",
    ", the characteristic length can be calculated from the second moment of the fourier transform of the filter kernel , the so - called _ transfer function_. however , since the implicit filter associated with the ppm is not explicitly known , we have to resort to the numerically computed energy spectra . using kolmogorov s law as reference spectrum function , we define an _ effective transfer function _",
    "@xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "the second moment of the squared transfer function is given by rather than @xmath113 .",
    "computationally , however , it is preferable to use the square of the transfer function . ]",
    "@xmath114 =     \\int_{0}^{\\infty}k^{2}\\hat{g}_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}(k , t){\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}k.\\ ] ] of course , the numerically computed spectrum function @xmath115 does not conform with the kolmogorov law at wave numbers comparable to @xmath116 , because of energy injection on the largest length scales .",
    "however , the contribution of these wave numbers to the above integral is small due to the factor @xmath117 .",
    "thus , we will ignore this error .",
    "discretising the transfer function in the fashion outlined in section  [ sc : spectrum ] and cutting off at the wavelength @xmath118 , the following approximation to the second moment is obtained : @xmath119 \\simeq     \\frac{1}{c}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha l}\\right)^{3 }      \\int_{0}^{n/2}{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}(\\alpha\\tilde{k})\\sum_{n}\\psi_{n}(t )      \\frac{\\tilde{\\mu}_{n}}{4\\pi}\\delta[\\alpha(\\tilde{k}-\\tilde{k}_{n})].\\ ] ] the second moment of the filter transfer function has the dimension of inverse length cubed .",

    "unfortunately , the validation of this conjecture would require an undue amount of computational resources .",

    "<S> although the bottleneck effect reduces the range of nearly inertial length scales considerably , we are able to estimate the value of the kolmogorov constant . for steady turbulence with a balance between energy injection and dissipation </S>",

    "<S> however , a smaller value is found in the case of transonic turbulence with a large fraction of compressive components in the driving force . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we discuss length scales related to the dissipation , in particular , an effective numerical length scale @xmath2 , which can be regarded as the characteristic smoothing length of the implicit filter associated with the ppm .    turbulence , turbulence modelling , compressible flows , dissipation , bottleneck effect , piece - wise parabolic method </S>"
