    "the comparison of existing data from the fopi - land experiment  @xcite with calculations performed with the urqmd transport model  @xcite suggested a moderately soft to linear symmetry term , characterized by a coefficient @xmath2 for the power - law parametrization of the density dependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy  @xcite .",

    "this had the effect that the originally intended measurement of detailed dependencies of the neutron flows on rapidity , transverse momentum , and particle type could not be fully realized .",

    "the technical deficiencies of the land timing system , the methods developed to correct for them in the analysis , and the consequences for the obtained results are described and explained in detail in the appendix .",
    "the confidence in the validity of the main , acceptance integrated , result is derived from the fact that it is found to be only weakly dependent on assumptions regarding details of the corrections .",

    "these systematic and the statistical errors of the collected data set are of approximately equal magnitude .",
    "the present work derives its importance also from the fact that the flow probe , at present , appears to be the most robust observable for testing the nuclear equation of state at high densities .",
    "the recent comprehensive study of charged - particle flows for @xmath0au+@xmath0au collisions at energies from 0.4 to 1.5 gev / nucleon reflects a remarkable consistency in its support of a soft solution for the equation of state of symmetric matter , including momentum - dependent forces  @xcite .",

    "such narrower limits for the compressibility of symmetric nuclear matter are very useful also with regard to the equation of state of asymmetric matter .",
    "they have the effect of reducing systematic uncertainties originating from the choice of parameters for the isoscalar sector of a transport description  @xcite .",
    "major efforts have recently been made to reduce the apparent systematic discrepancies in the interpretation of the fopi pion ratios  @xcite with increasingly complex transport calculations  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the observation that the predicted @xmath7 yield ratios are expected to rise when the medium modifications of pion production thresholds are explicitly considered  @xcite .",
    "this effect may permit reproducing the experimental values with choices for the symmetry energy that are less extreme than those required in some of the earlier pion studies  @xcite .",

    ", cases in which both time measurements are affected by the same time jump have not been touched .",
    "they remain correct regarding their positions @xmath71 but the problem of their erroneous arrival times @xmath73 is not solved yet .",
    "for that purpose , an additional correction step has been conceived .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the coincident location of the two signals of a hit in either regions a1 and b1 or in a2 and b2 of their respective @xmath75-vs-@xmath76 maps is a strong indication of a simultaneous jump .",
    "the correction step consists of either adding or subtracting 25  ns to both values @xmath77 and @xmath78 of that hit , so that they fall into the central regions of their maps .",
    "it is marked as @xmath79 step in the last column of table  [ tab : corr ] .",
    "it simply changes the arrival times @xmath73 by 25  ns but leaves the position @xmath71 and its correlation with @xmath72 unaffected .",
    "the so - obtained final @xmath73 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrb ] ( bottom panel , in blue ) .",
    "it is evident that the second correction step falsely modifies correctly measured cases of long or short times with time signals @xmath77 and @xmath78 accidentally falling into the marked regions .",
    "its effect is particularly large in the interval 640 to 660  ns of the @xmath73 spectrum , where it causes a depression ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrb ] , bottom panel ) . the geometric mean between the yields before and after this correction would approximately represent a smooth time spectrum that would seem more probable .",
    "this level can be reached if only about 80% of the hits near the center down to about 50% towards the edges of this region are actually moved in the second step , while the rest of the selected candidates are left at their original arrival times in the 640  ns - to-660  ns interval . however , as it is not known which of the hits should be moved and which should be left at their time positions , a correction of this kind is not properly feasible .",
    "it will smoothen the time spectrum but , because of the necessarily random selection , an inevitable mixing of hits between the affected time intervals will occur .",
    "this situation was addressed by considering the fraction of randomly selected hits whose arrival times are actually modified in step 2 as an unknown correction parameter . the time spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrb ] ( bottom panel ) and the comparison of flow results as a function of this fraction with fopi results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fopiflow ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : timcorr ] ) suggest a value of at least 40% . apart from that",
    ", it remains unknown and its significance for the differential flow ratios must be assessed .",
    "the result , a systematic variation of @xmath80 as a function of this fraction , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction ] and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffdat ] . for the acceptance - integrated analysis based on time - integrated data sets ( sec .",
    "[ sec : integ ] ) , the present corrections are of minor importance because very few hits are actually moved across the boundaries of the integration interval .",
    "owing to the logarithmic gain chosen for the new tacquila electronic board , the signals of low - energy @xmath49 rays fell below threshold with the effect that the calibration of the time spectra could not be based on a measured @xmath49 peak .",
    "the location of the zero - time - of - flight point @xmath81 was , therefore , determined from a comparison of velocity spectra , generated with various assumptions on @xmath81 , with the well - calibrated spectrum available from the fopi - land experiment .",
    "the high - velocity part of the spectrum was found to exhibit the most distinctive variation as a function of the choice for @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tzero ] ) .",
    "the presence of artificial peaks at arrival times @xmath82 and 702  ns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrb ] , bottom panel ) limited the useful range to velocities @xmath83  cm / ns or @xmath84  mev for nucleons .",
    "the rapid variation of the velocity spectrum with the choice of @xmath81 permitted its determination with an uncertainty of the order of 1  ns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tzero ] ) .",
    "its location at @xmath85  ns is marked in the spectrum of arrival times @xmath73 .",
    "as the displayed times are measured with respect to a delayed common stop signal , finite time - of - flight values are to the left of @xmath81 .",
    "photons would appear at @xmath86  ns , indicating that the yield at larger @xmath73 represents the level of background and of hits that are still misplaced .",
    "the interval @xmath87  cm / ns used for the comparison corresponds to @xmath88  ns , a region only mildly affected by corrections .",
    "the same is true for the main group of recorded hits with arrival times between @xmath89 and 685  ns , corresponding to flight times between 23 and 39  ns and to kinetic energies of 100 to 400 mev for nucleons ( note that artificial peaks are removed ) .",
    "the correction effects are stronger for arrival times between @xmath90 and 663  ns , expected for nucleons with approximately 30 to 70 mev kinetic energy .",
    "the time spectrum in that region is strongly modified by the second correction step moving particles from this region into the main group centered at @xmath91  ns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrb ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the threshold energy of 60 mev for protons to pass through the veto wall and to be detected in a land module is located within the affected region ( @xmath92  ns ) .",
    "the same is true for the thresholds of deuterons and tritons , located at smaller energy per nucleon and correspondingly longer times of flight .    to be independent of the applied corrections ,",
    "the acceptance - integrated result was obtained by integrating the time spectra up to @xmath93  ns , i.e. , beyond the critical regions .",
    "the maximum time of flight of 67.5  ns defines a threshold of 30  mev for neutrons .",
    "it is lower than the physical thresholds for charged particles , a condition that was equally applied in the urqmd simulations . only double time jumps and background events , apart from the neutrons below threshold , can contribute to the low - intensity region at @xmath94  ns .",
    "possible systematic effects related to these effects were investigated by varying the integration limit between @xmath95  ns , i.e. , flight times between 60 and 90  ns , and by correspondingly adjusting the neutron - energy threshold in the calculations .",
    "the resulting variation of @xmath49 is small as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tofinteg ] .",
    "it is once more noted here that the timing corrections are applied to all particles independently of whether they are charged or neutral .",
    "this has obviously reduced their influence on the flow ratios that are used as the principal observables , in agreement with the results of the tests performed .",
