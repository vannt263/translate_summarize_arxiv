    "nevertheless , this amazing success is today one of the most intriguing puzzles in particle physics .",
    "the resolution of the well known hierarchy and naturalness problems requires the existence of new physics at a scale of a few tev where new particles must appear . in general , signals for new spin  @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 states have been extensively studied .",
    "nevertheless , particles with higher spins may also appear .",
    "in particular , new massive spin-2 particles are of phenomenological interest .",
    "a well known example is the kaluza - klein excitation of the graviton , predicted in models with extra dimensions .",
    "less attention has been put on spin-2 particles that can appears as composite states formed by a pair of color - octet spin-1 fields ( colorons ) predicted in models like top - color , non - minimal technicolor and universal extra dimensions ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , in this last case , the massive spin-2 states may be colored .",
    "additionally , in a more standard sector , one of the most interesting features of strong interactions and qcd is the existence of many massive higher spin resonances ( such as like @xmath4(1670 ) , @xmath5(1690 ) or @xmath6(2040 ) ) which have a very important phenomenological role .",
    "local gauge invariance , which is one of the basic ingredients of the standard model gives a natural way to couple matter fields to a gauge field .",
    "for instance , in quantum electrodynamics , the electron is coupled to the photon by replacing the partial derivative in the dirac equation by a gauge covariant derivative .",
    "naively one may expect that the rule of minimal coupling holds also for any higher spin field .",
    "however it has already been noticed long time ago by fierz and pauli @xcite that this is not true . indeed",
    ", by naively replacing the derivative with the covariant derivative in the equations of motion of any field with spin higher than one immediately gets an algebraic inconsistency with the equations of motion . to avoid such inconsistencies several attempts",
    "have been done to derive the equations of motion and the subsidiary conditions for arbitrary spin fields coupled to a gauge field from an action principle . the only way known up to now to perform this is by introducing auxiliary fields in the lagrangian @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an explicit lagrangian for the generic bosonic case was proposed in @xcite",
    ".    unfortunately , also the introduction of auxiliary fields in the lagrangian does not leave the theory free of other severe pathologies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one well known pathology is that if one insists on the minimal coupling the theory does not propagate the correct number of degrees of freedom .",

    "such a coupling is known as the federbush model @xcite .",
    "the introduction of such non - minimal couplings however introduces a new pathology known as the velo - zwanziger problem i.e. super - luminal propagation of the fields and therefore acausal behavior @xcite , @xcite .    on the theoretical side , higher spin particles ( whose masses are of the order of @xmath7 ) have a fundamental role in string theory . in the context of string theory an interesting possibility to avoid",
    "the velo zwanziger problem , in a constant electromagnetic background , has been outlined in @xcite @xcite .",
    "on phenomenological side , all the experimentally observed higher spin particles are resonances rather than fundamental particles : consequently any local lagrangian describing them is only valid up to some finite uv cutoff .",
    "porrati and rahman @xcite have shown that the velo - zwanziger problem can be associated to the existence of an intrinsic cutoff scale in the lagrangian describing an interacting massive spin two particle .",
    "the authors analyzed the nature of the uv cutoff and showed that it is possible to construct an intrinsic , model independent uv cutoff .",
    "their results are based on the use of the st@xmath0ckelberg formalism since the st@xmath0ckelberg fields allow to construct gauge - invariant interactions for charge massive spin-2 fields .",
    "it is important to stress that the stckelberg formalism does not cure by itself the usual pathologies of interacting higher spin lagrangians as they are related to the existence of an intrinsic cutoff . in order to cure these pathologies",
    "it is necessary to introduce non - minimal couplings and additional degrees of freedom .",
    "this has been done for example in @xcite @xcite for lagrangians derived from string theory . in @xcite",
    "the cutoff scale can be pushed to a higher value by adding a new non - minimal coupling in form of a dipole term .    however in this paper we will show that the use of the stuckelberg formalism , introduces also a new problem associated to the gauge fixing . in principle",

    "one of the goals of this paper is to show that this apparently harmless procedure to choose a covariant gauge - fixing actually hides a non - trivial ir problem .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first it is shown how the porrati rahman action can be used to estimate some phenomenologically relevant process involving non - fundamental massive spin particles .",

    "the presence of gribov copies will be discussed .",
    "the last section will be dedicated to the conclusions .",

    "secondly , the st@xmath0ckelberg gauge parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are also charged group itself while , in the maxwell case , the gauge parameter is a real scalar function ( and so it carries no @xmath20 charge at all ) .",

    "consequently , in the abelian case , the st@xmath0ckelberg gauge parameters @xmath15 and @xmath14 are complex . as it will be shown in the following sections , it is because of these two differences that , in the case of the st@xmath31ckelberg gauge transformation , gauge fixing ambiguities appear in the abelian case as well .    the replacement corresponding to eq .",

    "( [ stu10 ] ) .    in @xcite it has been shown",
    "that an additional dipole term improves the intrinsic cutoff scale , moreover it has been shown in @xcite @xcite that , if higher powers of the background gauge field are dropped , an additional dipole term has to be included .",
    "such dipole term in the abelian case reads ( we follow the notation of @xcite)@xmath39 the non - abelian dipole term is the obvious generalization of the above one : @xmath40 although such a term does not affect the analysis of the gribov problem , it does affect the computations of physical quantities such as cross sections . in the following",
    "we will give an example of such computations both with and without the dipole term .",
    "at this point it is convenient to specialize our discussion by assuming that the gauge group of our theory is the usual color group @xmath41 and @xmath26 is nothing else but the gluon . starting from lagrangian ( [ stu10 ] ) , it is , then , possible to obtain the feynman rules needed for computing the double production of the color - octet spin-2 particles at the lhc , at tree level .",
    "we focus on double production since , as in any gauge theory , all the interaction terms contain the matter field ( in this case the spin-2 field ) in pairs . in principle , interaction terms coupling , for instance , two gluons to a single spin-2 particle are possible .",
    "nevertheless , we recall , such an interaction is not originated by the gauge principle and introduces an uv and model independent cut - off @xcite and theoretical uncertainties . in this sense",
    ", the situation is similar ( although more severe ) to the single production of spin-1 color - octet vector resonance which is plagued of theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",

    "we assume @xmath43 tev and a qcd coupling constant given by @xmath45    our numerical results are in agreement with the ones reported in @xcite which were obtained by a completely different method .",
    "however the inclusion of the dipole term , which is well motivated from the theoretical point of view , may significantly modify these results . in order to evaluate this effect , we computed the cross sections in the context of the lhc as above for different values of the @xmath46 parameter ( @xmath47 ) but taking a fixed value for the mass of the spin-2 particle ( @xmath48 tev ) . in figure [ fig : alpha ] [ fig : alpha ] , we show the effect of the dipole term by plotting the quantity @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cross section computed with the dipole term and @xmath51 is the cross section without the dipole .",
    "tev ]    notice that for the preferred value of @xmath46 , at least in the abelian case , ( @xmath52 ) the departure from the @xmath53 case is neglegible .",
    "in order to proceed , the st@xmath0ckelberg symmetry has to be gauge - fixed .",
    "the degrees of freedom of any gauge theory are encoded in a lie algebra valued one form @xmath54 .",
    "the action functional is invariant under finite gauge transformations@xmath55 whereas the physical observables are invariant under proper gauge transformations .",
    "unfortunately ( besides the cases of topological field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite ) , it is still unknown how to use in practice gauge invariant variable in yang - mills case",
    ". hence , the usual recipe to fix the gauge and to use perturbative expansion around the trivial vacuum @xmath56 provides one with excellent results when the coupling constant is small .",
    "the most convenient practical choices for the gauge fixing are the coulomb gauge and the landau gauge '' prescription in the propagators beyond one - loop computations ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) . ] .",
    "however gribov showed @xcite that a _ proper gauge fixing _ is not possible globally and that , in the qcd case , this global effect is very important in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown by singer @xcite , that if gribov ambiguities occur in coulomb gauge , they occur in all the gauge fixing conditions involving derivatives of the gauge field . in the path integral formalism , one has to pay close attention to the issue of gribov copies .",
    "indeed , as it is well known , there is a close relation between _ gauge fixing ambiguities _ and _ smooth zero modes of the faddeev - popov _ ( * fp * ) _ operator_. furthermore , even if one chooses a gauge free of gribov copies , the effects of gribov ambiguities in other gauges generate a breaking of the brst symmetry @xcite",
    ".    one can also verify that all the _ simple - minded hopes _ that the gribov problem can be solved automatically by the path - integral formalism itself fail .",
    "for instance , naively , one could think that if one performs the path integral without any restriction , the contributions coming from the non - trivial copies cancel against each others and one would be left with a sum in which there is just one term for each gauge orbit .",
    "unfortunately , the reality is totally different and one is confronted with the so - called neuberger @xmath57 problem @xcite .",
    "namely , in the most direct translation of brst symmetry on the lattice , there is a perfect cancellation among these gauge copies .",
    "consequently , the expectation value of any gauge invariant ( and thus physical ) observable in a lattice brst formulation will always be of the indefinite form @xmath57 and so ill - defined and , as it is well known , the formulation of the continuous theory does not help either .",
    "the arising of gribov copies can be described as a bifurcation problem .",
    "let @xmath26 a gauge potential in the landau gauge and @xmath58 a potential gauge - equivalent to @xmath26 . in the case of a perfect gauge fixing it should happen that the system of equations below@xmath59 has a unique trivial solution @xmath60 for any @xmath26 satisfying eq .",

    "the reason is that the relevant quantity for the appearance of zero modes is the above norm for @xmath26 . in order for the norm to be large enough ,",

    "hence , the gribov problem in @xmath21 gauge theories is an ir issue ( of course , this is not the case in gravity but we will focus on the yang - mills case here ) . on the other hand , the requirement to have finite norm in the above sense has been often criticized ( see , for an up - to - date discussion @xcite ) .",

    "in fact , as it will be now shown , the appearance of gauge fixing ambiguity in the st@xmath0ckelberg case _ does depend on the norm _ of @xmath26 which is the third key player in the analysis of the gauge fixing of the st@xmath0ckelberg symmetry .",
    "in other words , whether or not gauge fixing ambiguities appear in the st@xmath0ckelberg case _ depends on the ( norm of a ) gauge potential of another gauge symmetry _ ( maxwell in the present case ) .",
    "this shows that the analysis of the gribov phenomenon in the st@xmath0ckelberg case is more complicated than in the usual cases due to the fact that it depends heavily with the interactions with another ( non - st@xmath0ckelberg ) gauge field . in the appendix",
    "we will also show that a very similar gribov - like ambiguity appears in the case of proca fields .    for simplicity",
    ", one can assume @xmath15 as orthogonal to @xmath26 in such a way that the above system reduces to@xmath96 where , as it has been already explained in the previous sections , the gauge parameter @xmath14 and @xmath15 are charged under the maxwell gauge symmetry .",
    "one can take @xmath91 obtaining the following system of equations@xmath97 in which the gauge field plays the role of an external background field .",
    "we will now show that gauge fixing ambiguities may arise when the gauge potential background @xmath26 is large enough \" .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the most interesting case in which @xmath26 is locally a pure gauge .",
    "the interest of this choice is that a pure gauge will pass even the most severe requirements which are usually imposed to avoid the gribov issue ( see the discussion in the previous section ) . in particular",
    ", a pure gauge has finite energy and action .",
    "hence , once it is found that a pure gauge potential can support non - trivial solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gf8.5 ] ) , there is no reasonable physical boundary condition which can justify the omission of such solution . obviously , by enlarging the class of possible anstze for @xmath26 one would also enlarge the number of different non - trivial solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gf8.5 ] ) but our choice is the one which discloses in the clearest possible way the origin of the phenomenon .    in order to find such copies it is useful to notice that in the case of @xcite , eq . ( [ gf8.5 ] ) reads @xmath98    let us analyze the @xmath20 st@xmath0ckelberg theory within a four - dimensional torus @xmath99 ( this case corresponds to put the system at finite temperature and in a finite space volume ) .",
    "such a situation is not just of academic interest since these circumstances are achieved , for example , in relativistic heavy ion collisions as those experimentally studied at rhic and the lhc ( pb - pb mode ) .",
    "the natural boundary conditions for @xmath15 are the periodic ones .",
    "let us consider in eq .",
    "( [ gf9 ] ) a pure gauge potential @xmath100 ( which obviously satisfies periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "it is enough to consider @xmath15 where only two components are switched on , for example @xmath101 and @xmath102 where both functions depend only on the variables @xmath103 . using as ansatz @xmath104 the orthogonality condition",
    "@xmath105 implies @xmath106 choosing @xmath15 to be divergence free i.e. @xmath107 we get @xmath108 so that eventually we get @xmath109    taking into account that @xmath26 must be real , it is then straightforward to check that ( [ ansatzlambda ] ) and ( [ ortholambda ] ) are solutions of ( [ gf9 ] ) which satisfy the correct boundary conditions ( i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath110 are purely imaginary ) only if @xmath111 hence , smooth solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gf9 ] ) satisfying the periodic boundary conditions ( which represent infinitesimal gribov copies of the st@xmath31ckelberg gauge symmetry within @xmath99 ) appear when the gauge potential is large enough .",
    "interestingly enough , the condition in eq .",
    "( [ necond ] ) is very similar to the usual condition determining the appearance of gribov copies in the yang - mills case ( when the product  coupling constant time gauge potential \" must be large enough to give rise to infinitesimal copies ) .",
    "the present st@xmath0ckelberg gribov copies are related _ both _ to the presence of the massive spin two field _ and _ to the fact that the gauge parameter is charged under another ( non - st@xmath0ckelberg ) gauge group .    since",
    "( at least in the rather extreme case we have considered ) only large \" constant gauge potentials generate infinitesimal gribov copies of the st@xmath0ckelberg gauge symmetry an intriguing possibility arises .",
    "one could solve the problem using also in this case a gribov - zwanziger like restriction .",
    "however , as it has been already explained , the implementation of the gribov - zwanziger restriction in the present case is more complicated than in the qcd case . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting to note that one obvious consequence of such restriction would be the appearance of non - local propagators for the higher spin massive particles . in this sense",
    ", this would not be a surprise since , within the approach developed in @xcite , massive higher spin particles can be described without auxiliary fields the price to pay being the appearance of non - local propagators .",
    "we hope to analyze in future the relations between the two approaches .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the interactions of a massive spin-2 particles charged under both abelian and non - abelian group using the porrati - rahman lagrangian .",
    "moreover , a scalar field is needed in 4d due to the presence of an ambiguity in minimal coupling .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite @xcite  that if higher powers of the background gauge field are dropped , an additional dipole term has to be included . in this way ,",
    "the well - known inconsistencies ( like acausality and wrong number of propagating degrees of freedom ) are under control provided one uses the action only as an effective action with a characteristic uv cutoff scale .",
    "we have shown that , besides the well understood uv cut - off ( signaling the arising of pathologies such as the velo - zwanziger problem ) , this lagrangian has also some non - trivial ir issues . their origin is a gauge - fixing ambiguity akin of gribov copies in qcd for the st@xmath0ckelberg symmetry in an abelian background .",
    "this type of ambiguity prevents a global covariant gauge fixing of the st@xmath0ckelberg symmetry ( which is the only gauge - fixing choice unifying phenomena such as strong coupling at finite energy scale , acausal propagation in external fields and so on ) .",
    "explicit examples have been found when the theory is analyzed within a finite volume . in this case",
    ", we have constructed gribov copies corresponding to the st@xmath0ckelberg gauge symmetry supported by abelian gauge potentials with zero field strength ( but large enough norm ) . to the best of authors knowledge ,",
    "this is the first analysis of the peculiar features of the gribov problem for  the st@xmath0ckelberg gauge symmetry . at least in the case of a constant gauge potential ,",
    "gauge fixing ambiguities only arise when the gauge potential is large enough \" ( as it happens in qcd ) . from the phenomenological point of view , this is a fortunate circumstance since it allows perturbative analysis , like the one presented in section [ sec : pheno ] , which can be useful for the experimental search of colored spin-2 states predicted by some models . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", it is natural to wonder whether the gribov - zwanziger strategy of restricting the path integral to a copy free region can be applied in this case as well .",
    "we hope to come back on this interesting issue in the future .",
    "the authors thank dario francia and the anonimous referee for their many useful comments and suggestions which improved a lot this manuscript . this work is partially supported by fondecyt grants 1160137 , 1150246 and 1160423 , conicyt proyecto basal fb0821 and act1406 .",
    "the centro de estudios cientficos ( cecs ) is funded by the chilean government through the centers of excellence base financing program of conicyt .",
    "in this appendix we will show that a similar gribov - like phenomenon also appears for proca fields .",
    "the results in the main text together with the discussion in this appendix suggest that this phenomenon could be relevant for higher spin fields as well . here",
    "we will follow the presentation of the charged proca field outlined in @xcite .",
