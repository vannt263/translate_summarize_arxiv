    "since stoler , saleh and teich proposed the binomial states ( bs ) in 1985 @xcite , so - called _ intermediate _ states which interpolate between some fundamental states such as number states , coherent and squeezed states and phase states have attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "the bs are finite linear combinations of number states @xmath0^{1/2 } |n\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a non - negative integer , @xmath2 is a _ real _ probability ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 is a number state of the radiation field .",
    "the photon number distribution is clearly a binomial distribution , whence the name _",
    "binomial state_. the bs are intermediate number - coherent states in the sense that they reduce to number and coherent states in different limits @xmath5 the bs also admit an eigenvalue definition @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the annihilation , creation and the number operators , respectively .",
    "the algebra involved is the su(2 ) algebra ( holstein - primakoff realization @xcite ) @xmath10 and in the present case the coherent state limit is essentially the contraction of su(2 ) to the heisenberg - weyl algebra generated by @xmath11 and 1 .    since number and coherent states are eigenstates of the number operator @xmath12 and the annihilation operator @xmath7 , respectively",
    ", it would seem more natural that , to define states interpolating between number and coherent states , we consider the eigenvalue equation of a linear combination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 itself ( not @xmath14 ) , namely , @xmath15 here @xmath16 as before and @xmath17 is an eigenvalue which will be determined not only from the eigenvalue equation eq.([equation1 ] ) but also by a _ physical requirement _ ( see sec.2 ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the states @xmath18 and their various properties .",
    "we find that for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 a non - negative integer ) , the solutions to eq.([equation1 ] ) are indeed intermediate states which interpolate between number and coherent states .",
    "we also find that these states are closely related to the photon - added coherent states proposed by agarwal and tara @xcite .",
    "the properties of this new state , such as their sub - poissonian statistics , antibunching effects and squeezing effects , as well as their quasi - probability distributions ( the q and wigner functions ) , are studied in detail .",
    "although coherent and number states are not squeezed , the new interpolating states are squeezed , and exhibit highly nonclassical behavior .",
    "we also propose a scheme to produce these intermediate states in a cavity .",
    "the intermediate number - coherent states are of particular interest in their interaction with atomic systems . in the context of the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model , atomic population inversion exhibits two completely different phenomena : rabi oscillation when the field is initially prepared in a number state ; and periodic collapse and revival when the field is initially prepared in a coherent state .",
    "we naturally expect that the states proposed in this paper will present phenomena intermediate between rabi oscillation and periodic collapse - revival , given that the initial state of the field is in an intermediate state .",
    "in sec.6 we study the interaction of the states with the atomic systems based on the two - photon jc model and we indeed observe this intermediate behavior .",
    "we also give an analytic derivation of the approximate photon number distribution of the field and find it exhibits strong oscillation at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 the scaled time ) .",
    "this phenomena is explained physically in terms of the entropy and q - function of the field .",
    "in this section we solve the eigenvalue equation eq.([equation1 ] ) , discuss the relation of the states ( 1.5 ) to photon - added coherent states and study the limit to number and coherent states .      expanding the state @xmath18 in number states @xmath23 inserting it into eq.([equation1 ] ) and comparing the two sides of the equation , we find the solution of the eigenvalue equation eq.([equation1 ] ) @xmath24[\\beta-\\sqrt{\\eta}(n-2 ) ]     \\cdots \\beta}{(\\sqrt{1-\\eta})^n\\sqrt{n ! } } |n\\rangle ,     \\label{solution2}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the normalization constant . here",
    ", the eigenvalue @xmath26 is an arbitrary complex number .",
    "it is easy to see that for any complex number @xmath26 the state eq.([solution2 ] ) reduces to the coherent state @xmath27 in the limit @xmath28 , as expected .",
    "however , it does not have a number state limit for arbitrary @xmath26 since number states are eigenstates of @xmath12 with non - negative integer eigenvalues .",
    "further , we would like to have truncated states which are _ finite _ superpositions of the number states just as the binomial states are . with this in mind , we must choose @xmath29 , where @xmath20 is a non - negative integer . in this case",
    "it is easy to see that the coefficients @xmath30 are truncated @xmath31 here the normalization constant @xmath32 is obtained as @xmath33 ^ 2 n!}\\right]^{-        \\frac{1}{2}}=        \\frac{\\lambda^m}{\\sqrt{m!l_m(-\\lambda^2 ) } } ,        \\label{trunc2}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the laguerre polynomial @xcite @xmath36 inserting eq.([trunc1 ] ) and eq.([trunc2 ] ) into eq.([expand ] ) , we obtain the desired solution @xmath37 @xmath38 which is a _ finite _ linear superposition of number states .",
    "we now consider the limiting cases of above state eq.([state1 ] ) as number and coherent states .",
    "first consider the limit @xmath39 . from the number - state expansion eq.([state1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath40 namely , @xmath41 .",
    "then , in the different limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 a real constant , we have @xmath45 and therefore eq.([state1 ] ) reduces to the coherent state @xmath46 .",
    "the above discussion shows that the state @xmath47 may be considered as an intermediate state which interpolates between a number state and a coherent state .",
    "the state eq.([state1 ] ) can be written in more elegant form . by making use of @xmath48",
    ", we can write eq.([state1 ] ) as @xmath49     |0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m!l_m(-\\lambda^2 ) } }     \\left(a^\\dagger + \\lambda\\right)^m     |0\\rangle , \\label{bnnn}\\ ] ] where we have used the binomial formula .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the equation ( real @xmath50 in our case ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the displacement operator @xmath53,\\ ] ] we can rewrite eq.([bnnn ] ) in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a coherent state and @xmath56 is a so - called _ photon - added coherent state _ or _ excited coherent state _",
    "so from eq.([final ] ) we conclude that our new intermediate number - coherent states are _ displaced excited coherent states_.    however , we would like to point out that our states are very different from the photon - added coherent states .",
    "the photon - added states are an _",
    "infinite _ superposition of number states from @xmath57 to infinity , while our states are a _",
    "finite _ superposition of number states from 0 to @xmath57 .",
    "in this section we shall investigate the statistical and squeezing properties of @xmath47 , with special emphasis on the comparison with those of the bs .",
    "the easily - derived relation @xmath58^{1/2 } \\|\\eta , m - k\\rangle,\\ ] ] for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 , gives the mean value of @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath64 and mandel q - parameter @xcite @xmath65 if @xmath66 ( _ resp .",
    "_ @xmath67 ) , the field in the state @xmath68 is sub - poissonian ( _ resp._super - poissonian ) .",
    "@xmath69 corresponds to poissonian statistics .    for a fixed @xmath57 ,",
    "there are two extreme cases , @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath74 in agreement with the q - parameter values for number states and the vacuum state .",
    "here we have used the fact @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "1 is a plot of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "the q - parameter of the binomial states ( bs ) is also presented in the figure ( @xmath82 for any @xmath20 ) . from the figure we observe that the field in @xmath68 is _ sub - poissonian _ except for the case @xmath70 .",
    "we say that a field is antibunched if the second - order correlation function @xmath83@xcite .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of antibunching effects and sub - poissonian statistics coincides for single mode , time - independent fields such as the state @xmath47 of this paper .",
    "so the field @xmath47 is antibunched except at the point @xmath70 .",
    "define two quadratures @xmath84 ( coordinate ) and @xmath85 ( momentum ) @xmath86 then we can easily obtain their variances @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89",

    "then , as @xmath80 increases the field becomes squeezed until maximum squeezing is reached ; then the squeezing decreases until it disappears at a point @xmath98 depending on @xmath57 .",
    "we note that @xmath99 when @xmath100 since @xmath101 when @xmath102 .",
    "we also observe from fig.2 that the larger @xmath20 , the stronger the squeezing , and the wider the squeezing range .",
    "it is known that the optimal signal - to - quantum noise ratio for an arbitrary quantum state @xmath103 has the value @xmath104 which is attainable for the usual coherent squeezed state@xcite . for a coherent state",
    "the maximal ratio is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the mean value of the number operator @xmath12 for the quantum state .    for the intermediate number - coherent state @xmath47 ,",
    "the signal - to - quantum noise ratios for different parameters @xmath80 and @xmath20 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the ratio for @xmath70 and @xmath72 , which correspond to the vacuum state and number state respectively , is zero .",
    "for other @xmath107 , we find from fig.3 ( a ) that the larger @xmath20 , the larger the ratio .",
    "fig.3 ( b ) gives plots of @xmath108 ( @xmath109 is given by eq.(3.2 ) ) , @xmath110 and the ratio for the state @xmath47 with @xmath111 .",
    "we find that    \\(1 ) the ratio for @xmath47 is always smaller than the value @xmath108 , which is in accord with the general result@xcite ;    \\(2 ) for some values of @xmath80 the ratio is larger than @xmath112 .",
    "we observe that the states with ratio larger than @xmath113 correspond to squeezed states ( see fig.2 . ) .",
    "quasi - probability distributions @xcite in the coherent state basis turn out to be useful measures for studying the nonclassical features of radiation fields . in this section",
    "we study the q - function ( also called the husimi function ) and the wigner function of the state @xmath47 .    one can prove that ( see appendix a ) , if two states @xmath114 and @xmath115 satisfy @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the displacement operator , the q and wigner functions of @xmath114 are simply a displacement of those of @xmath118 , namely @xmath119 so the q - function and the wigner function of the state @xmath47 are easily obtained from those of the photon - added coherent states given in @xcite @xmath120    the q - function eq.([qfunc ] ) has a @xmath121-fold zero at the position @xmath122 , which signals the nonclassical behaviour .",
    "these zeros are related to the negative parts of the wigner function , since the q - function can be defined as a smoothed wigner function .",
    "fig.4 gives plots of the wigner function of @xmath123 for @xmath124 and different @xmath80 .",
    "one can clearily see the negative parts , except for the case @xmath70 which corresponds to the vacuum state whose wigner function is simply a gaussian centered at the origin . as @xmath107 increases from 0 , the gaussian distribution continuously deforms to the wigner function of the number state @xmath125 .",
    "we can also study squeezing properties from the q - function by examining the deformation of its contours .",
    "fig.5 is the contour plot of q functions for @xmath126 and different @xmath80 .",
    "we see that , when we increase @xmath80 , the contour is squeezed in the @xmath127 direction until a maximum squeezing is reached .",
    "then the contour deforms to the shape of a banana , which occupies a wider range in the @xmath94 direction and the squeezing is reduced .",
    "finally , we obtain a circular contour for larger @xmath80 corresponding to no squeezing ( c.f .",
    "the main difference between the intermediate states described herein and photon - added coherent states is that the former are a _",
    "finite _ superposition of number states .",
    "this suggests the possibility of an experiment to produce these states using the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "we can also generate the state @xmath47 by using the interaction of a photon and a two - level atom with an external classical driving field @xmath128 in a cavity . in the rotating wave approximation , the hamiltonian(@xmath129 )",
    "is @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are atomic operators , @xmath134 is the one - photon coupling constant , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the atomic transition frequency and cavity resonant mode frequency respectively , and we take the driving field @xmath128 to be real and constant .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath137 using the following relation ( see appendix b ) @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the displacement operator , we have @xmath140 now we consider the on - resonance case , @xmath141 . then the interaction hamiltonian is time - independent @xmath142 and therefore its time evolution operator is @xmath143 suppose that the field is initially prepared in the vacuum state @xmath144 and the atom in the excited state @xmath145 ; namely , at @xmath146 , the system is in the state @xmath147 . at time",
    "@xmath148 we have @xmath149 when @xmath150 , we have @xmath151    \\otimes |g\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the atom is detected in the ground state @xmath152 , the field is reduced to the state @xmath153 with @xmath154 .",
    "the state @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) can be generated by a multiphoton generalization of the hamiltonianeq.([hamil1 ] ) , namely , @xmath157 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath128 depends on the external driving field and is a tunable parameter .",
    "in particular , for large enough @xmath57 , we can control the output state to be either a number or a coherent state by tuning the parameter @xmath158 .",
    "finally we may infer the presence of these new intermediate states to first order in an idealized non - linear optics experiment .",
    "consider a nonlinear mach - zehnder interferometer with a kerr medium in one arm .",
    "the output state is the displaced kerr state @xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the displacement operator and @xmath161 , @xmath162 is the length of the kerr medium , @xmath163 the appropriate phase velocity inside the medium and @xmath164 the third - order susceptibility .",
    "when @xmath165 , and @xmath166 is small enough , the above states can be approximated as @xmath167 showing the presence of the state @xmath168 in first order . in general , if we use a @xmath169th - order nonlinear kerr medium modelled in the interaction picture by @xcite @xmath170 we can find @xmath155 when @xmath171 is small enough .",
    "in this section we turn to the interaction of the state @xmath47 with a simple two - level system in the framework of the two - photon jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite described by the following hamiltonian ( @xmath172 ) @xmath173 with @xmath174 the notation is as in eq.([hamil1 ] ) , but now @xmath175 is the two - photon coupling constant for transition @xmath176 .",
    "suppose that , at the initial time @xmath146 , atom and field are decoupled and the atom is initially in the excited state @xmath145 , while the field is in the intermediate number - coherent state @xmath177 .",
    "then the combined atom - field wave function at time @xmath178 is obtained as @xmath179 where @xmath180 for simplicity , we only consider the on - resonance interaction case @xmath181 as in @xcite whereupon eq.([solution ] ) simplifies to @xmath182 we now discuss some quantum characteristics of the system arising from the equation eq.([solution1 ] ) .",
    "atomic population inversion is an important atomic observable in the jcm and is defined as the difference between the probabilities of finding the atom in the excited state and in the ground state . from eq.([solution1 ] ) , the atomic population inversion is obtained as @xmath183    fig.6 gives the inversion vs. scaled time @xmath184 for different @xmath20 and @xmath80 . from fig.6 , we observe that the atomic population inversion exhibits the conventional rabi oscillation for the @xmath20-number state limit ( @xmath102 ) .",

    "we observe the collapse - revival phenomenon , as we expect , with a revival time @xmath188 which can be estimated as @xmath189 @xcite for high enough @xmath190 ( that is , _ revival frequency _ @xmath191 ) ( fig.6(d ) ) .",
    "for the general intermediate case ( fig.6(b , c ) ) , remnants of both behaviour are seen ; namely , an oscillation of frequency @xmath192 modulated by the frequency @xmath193 with modulated amplitude dependent on the parameter @xmath80 and @xmath20 .",
    "we now consider the cavity field observables , beginning with entropy which is a measure of the _ amount of chaos _ or lack of information about a system @xcite .",
    "the entropy @xmath194 of a quantum - mechanical system is defined as @xcite @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the density operator of the quantum system and the boltzmann constant @xmath197 is equal to unity . for a pure state ,",
    "@xmath198 ; otherwise @xmath199 , and it increases with increasing number of microstates with decreasing statistical weight .    in this subsection",
    "we study the time evolution of the field entropy in our system .",
    "barnett and phoenix @xcite have proved that the field entropy @xmath200 equals the atomic entropy @xmath201 if the total initial state is a pure state . from eq.([solution1 ] ) the atomic reduced density operator @xmath202 can be easily obtained as @xmath203 where @xmath204 then the field and atomic entropy @xmath205 can be expressed as @xmath206 where @xmath207 are eigenvalues of the atomic reduced field density operator @xmath208 @xmath209    the field entropy @xmath200 as a function of @xmath22 is presented in fig.7 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath200 is a periodic function of time and it exhibits the conventional oscillation for the @xmath20-number state limit . as in the case of coherent initial states , the field entropy during the time evolution is dynamically reduced to zero at revival time @xmath210 which means the cavity field can be periodically found in pure states , and reaches a maximum at @xmath211 and falls quickly to a minimum at @xmath212 .",
    "furthermore , for the general intermediate case , the field entropy has more minima as shown in fig.7 ( b , c ) due to the frequency modulation .",
    "the quasi - probability distribution q - function is defined as @xcite : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the field reduced density operator @xmath215 , \\label{rdmf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath216 is the coherent state .",
    "so the q - function of the cavity field is @xmath217    in fig.8 we give contour plots of the q - function at different times @xmath218 for @xmath219 . at time @xmath220 , the q - function has only a single peak and the field is in the pure quantum state @xmath221 ( c.f .",
    "fig.5 ) . with the development of time ,",
    "the q - function begins to separate into two peaks .",
    "the smaller @xmath80 , the faster the seperation . at time @xmath222",
    ", the q - function exhibits the most separation and the field is in a mixed state since the entropy reaches its maximum .",

    "from these figures we can observe that the photon number distribution exhibits strong oscillation at time @xmath232 and @xmath233 for the intermediate states .",
    "in fact , at those times , the field is a superposition of two components ( see fig.8 ) and its emtropy decreases rapidly to a minimum ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "partial interference between two component results in strong oscillation of the photon number distribution .",

    "this effect is not hard to understand .",
    "in fact , at @xmath235 , we have the following approximate result ( see apendix c ) @xmath236|c_n(\\eta , m)|^2    \\sin^2\\left[\\left(n-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\tau    \\right]_{\\tau=\\frac{\\pi}{4 } } \\label{614}\\ ] ] for the high enough @xmath109 case .",
    "eq.([614 ] ) is a strongly oscillating function which explains the large oscillations of the photon number distribution .",

    "in this paper we have described new states @xmath68 which interpolate between number and coherent states and have investigated their various properties . unlike photon - added coherent states , to which they are related , these states are a _ finite _ superposition of number states .",
    "we also analyzed the limiting cases @xmath250 and @xmath251 @xmath252 corresponding to number and coherent states respectively . salient statistical properties of @xmath47 such as the sub - poissonian distribution , the anti - bunching effect and the squeezing effects were investigated for a wide range of parameters .",
    "the non - classical features of thse states for certain parameter ranges were demonstrated in terms of the quasiprobability distributions , the q and wigner functions .",
    "we also proposed an experiment to generate these states , inferring their presence in certain non - linear systems .",
    "we then considered the interaction of these interpolating number - coherent states with a two - level atomic system , exemplified by the two - photon jaynes - cummings model .",
    "we first studied the dynamics of atomic population inversion . on an intuitive level",
    ", one expects that the response of the atomic system will vary between the rabi oscillation typical of an initial number state , and the collapse - revival mode for an initial coherent state ; and indeed this is what one obtains .",
    "we found that it exhibited the conventional rabi oscillation for the @xmath20-number state limit with frequency @xmath253 ( @xmath187 ) and the collapse - revival phenomenon for the coherent state limit with rivival frequency @xmath254 .",

    "it is of interest that the photon number distribution exhibit strong oscillation at @xmath256 . at those times",
    ", the field entropy falls rapidly to a minimum and the q - function separates into two peaks , which means that the field is a superposition of almost pure states and interference between components of the superposition state leads to strong oscillation of the photon number distribution .",
    "an approximate analytical solution is presented to explain this result .",
    "the remarkable properties of these intermediate number - coherent states provide a useful tool for theoretical investigation of model systems ; their generation by non - linear systems tempts us to believe that the states found in this paper may play an important role in quantum optics .",

    "in this appendix we present an analytical treatment of the photon number distribution in the large photon number regime .",
    "the photon number distribution of the two - photon jc model with initial state @xmath267 can be obtained as @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the scaled time as before .",
    "here we only consider an initial field state which is narrower than that of a coherent state . for a distribution @xmath270",
    "we can calculate the variance as @xmath271 for the coherent state @xmath46 , we have @xmath272 .",

    "however , @xmath283 can not be zero for any @xmath239 due to the term @xmath284 and the oscillation is not perfect . nevertheless , the oscillation is perfect at a slightly earlier time @xmath234 , as indicated in ref.@xcite ( for initial coherent state ) and fig.9(a , b ) .",
    "now we turn to the analytical approximate result eq.([614 ] ) . for the intermediate state , we can write the variance as @xmath287 where @xmath288",
    ". in general , we have @xmath289 . for large enough @xmath290 , or @xmath20",
    ", we have @xmath291 and therefore @xmath292 which leads to @xmath293 .",
    "so the result eq.([9 ] ) is valid for the intermediate state case .",
