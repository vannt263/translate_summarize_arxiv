    "these two x - ray types are emitted within a picosecond time window from the muonic atoms used ( as is further explained in the appendix[app : exp ] ) .",
    "special attention was given to time calibration in order to avoid possible timing shifts created by the distinct standard traces @xmath17 and @xmath18 used for different signals .",
