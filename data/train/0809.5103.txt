    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have now been discovered in the center of a sufficiently large number of nearby galaxies to probe possible links between the masses of smbhs ( ) and the global properties of their host galaxies .",
    "in fact , it has emerged that  correlates with the luminosity @xcite , mass @xcite , stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , light concentration @xcite , and gravitational binding energy @xcite of the host - galaxy spheroidal component , i.e. , the entire galaxy in the case of elliptical galaxies or the bulge of disk galaxies . in light of these findings",
    "it is now widely accepted that the mass - accretion history of a smbh is tightly related through feedback to the formation and evolution of the host spheroid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some studies having suggested a link with the mass of the dark - matter halo @xcite .",
    "the slope and scatter of all these correlations remain quite uncertain @xcite , however , in particular since they are still based on a limited sample of galaxies with reliable  that is biased towards early - type systems and that is clustered around a rather limited range of stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) , approximately between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . given the great theoretical interest spurred by these findings , there is a pressing need to acquire better  statistics , both in terms of the number of targets and in terms of broadening the range of parent galaxies , in particular towards spiral galaxies .",
    "secure  measurements in external galaxies are traditionally obtained through the modeling of the stellar and/or gaseous kinematics , most often as derived using _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations in the optical domain .",
    "the advent of adaptive - optics systems working at near - infrared wavelengths has led to more stellar - dynamical measurements of from the ground @xcite . yet",
    ", such measurements are still quite expensive , not only because good - quality measurements of the stellar kinematics in the near - infrared require relatively long observations , but also because proper modeling of the stellar kinematics in the immediate vicinity of smbhs needs robust constraints on the importance of radial orbits and thus additional large - scale observations , possibly with integral - field spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "water - masers have provided the most accurate extragalactic measurements to date , but such gaseous systems are exceedingly rare @xcite .",
    "the modeling of the nuclear ionized - gas kinematics has also led to accurate  measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at a relatively cheap cost in terms of observation time compared to stellar - dynamical  determinations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , only an handful of the objects targeted by hst turned out to have sufficiently regular gas velocity fields for the purpose of modeling @xcite . thus , unless a large number of galaxies pre - selected to have regular nuclear gas kinematics ( for instance following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is observed with hst if and when the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) is successfully refurbished , it is unlikely that the number of galaxies with secure  measurements will increase dramatically in the near future .",
    "the hst science archive already contains an untapped resource that can be used to better constrain the black - hole mass budget across the different morphological types of galaxies , which consists of the vast number of the stis spectra from which a central emission - line width can be measured .",
    "the modeling of this kind of data can indeed lead to tight upper limits on , as first shown by @xcite .",
    "for this reason we started a program aimed at deriving  upper limits based on hst spectra for the largest possible number of galaxies and a wide range of morphological types . in this paper",
    "we present the results based on a sample of 105 nearby galaxies for which stis / g750 m spectra in the  region and measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion were available from the hst archive and in the literature , respectively .",
    "although we will be able only to set an upper limit on the  of our galaxies , the lack of exact measurements will be compensated for by the large number of upper limits when studying smbh mass - host galaxy relationships .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : analysis ] we describe our sample selection and the measurement of central emission - line width , before briefly describing our modeling .",
    "we will then present our results and discuss our findings in the context of the  relation between the sbhm mass and central stellar velocity dispersion of the host spheroid in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "in order to assemble the largest possible sample of homogeneous measurements of the central emission - line width , we queried the hst science archive for objects with stis spectra obtained with the g750 m grating through either the @xmath7 or the @xmath8 slit placed across the galaxy nucleus , most often at random position angles .",
    "this is indeed by far the most common configuration in the archive , which always gives us access to the ,  and  emission lines . limiting ourselves to galaxies within 100 mpc to minimize the impact of the stellar potential on our results",
    ", we retrieved data for 177 galaxies spanning the whole range of morphological types . when available , galactic distances were adopted from measurements based either on surface - brightness fluctuations @xcite , cepheid variables @xcite or from @xcite .",
    "otherwise we used the weighted mean recessional velocity corrected to the reference frame defined by the microwave background radiation from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rc3 hereafter ) to derive the distance to our sample galaxies by assuming @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the median distance of the sample galaxies is 21.4 mpc .",
    "the archival spectra were reduced using iraf and the stis reduction pipeline maintained by the space telescope science institute @xcite .",
    "the basic reduction steps included overscan subtraction , bias subtraction , dark subtraction , and flatfield correction .",
    "different spectra obtained for the same slit position were aligned using imshift and knowledge of the adopted shifts along the slit position .",
    "cosmic ray events and hot pixels were removed using the task lacos_spec by @xcite .",
    "residual bad pixels were corrected by means of a linear one - dimensional interpolation using the data quality files and stacking individual spectra with imcombine , this allowed to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the resulting spectra .. we performed wavelength and flux calibration as well as geometrical correction for two - dimensional distortion following the standard reduction pipeline and applying the x2d task .",
    "this task corrected the wavelength scale to the heliocentric frame too .    to measure the nuclear emission - line width we generally extracted aperture spectra three ( @xmath12 ) and five pixels wide ( @xmath13 ) centered on the continuum peak , for the @xmath14 and @xmath15-wide slit cases , respectively .",
    "when the spectra were obtained with a 2-pixel binning read - out mode along the spatial direction , we extracted aperture spectra three pixels wide ( @xmath16 ) for the @xmath15-wide slit ( table  1 ) .",
    "the extracted spectra thus consist of the central emission convolved with the stis spatial point - spread function ( psf ) and sampled over nearly square apertures of @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , roughly corresponding to a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the wavelength range of our spectra is either 6482@xmath17054   or 6295 @xmath1 6867  , depending on whether the g750 m grating was used at the primary or secondary tilt .",
    "the instrumental fwhm was 0.87   ( @xmath23 ) and 1.6   ( @xmath24 ) for the @xmath14 and the @xmath15-wide slit , respectively .",
    "the atlas of all the extracted spectra will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    to place our  upper limits with the  relation ,",
    "here we consider only galaxies with velocity dispersion measurements in the literature , which were available for 137 objects .",
    "we also dropped a further five objects , since upon closer inspection they revealed unrelaxed morphologies . for a number of objects with a sharp central surface - brightness profile , the two - dimensional rectification of the spectrum performed during the data reduction produced anomalous undulations in the flux level of continuum of the very central rows ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "this introduced also artificial fluctuations in the emission - line flux profiles across the nucleus .",
    "as constraining the concentration of the nebular emission is key to our modeling ( see  [ sec : modeling ] ) , this problem forced us to remove a further eight galaxies from our sample .      in order to derive upper limits on  following the method of (",
    "* see also  [ sec : modeling ] ) we need to measure both the width of the central nebular emission and the radial profile of the emission - line flux , so that we can gauge both the depth of the potential well and the concentration of its gaseous tracer .",
    "to side - step the impact of broad and/or asymmetric emission arising from regions much smaller than our resolution limit , we focus on the width of the narrow component of the emission from forbidden transitions and disregard the broad - line emission in our spectra . in the wavelength range of our spectra that means measuring the central width and flux profile of the  lines since these are usually brighter than the  lines .",
    "the  doublet also traces the nuclear kinematics better than , given that this line could be significantly affected by emission from circumnuclear star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to measure the central width and flux profile of the narrow component of the  lines we fit our spectra with multiple gaussians to match both the broad and narrow components of all the observed lines , while describing the stellar continuum with a low - order polynomial",
    ". a flux ratio of 1:3 was assumed for the  doublet , as dictated by atomic physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the presence also of  emission , both the  and  doublets were assumed to share a common line centroid and width . in most cases",
    "only one additional gaussian component was needed in our fits , to describe the  emission from the broad - line region , although in many objects also the forbidden  and  lines required double - gaussian profiles .",
    "this allowed us to describe also lines with voigt profiles , where tests on 18 galaxies showed that our narrowest gaussian component tend to be only slightly broader than the thermal component in the voigt profiles , generally by less than 20% .",
    "the extra gaussian in the  and  lines was also used to isolate the contribution of blue- or redshifted wings . to help deblending the +  region in some cases we followed @xcite and assigned to both the  lines and the narrow  emission the line profile that was predetermined by fitting the  lines .",
    "the best - fitting gaussian parameters were derived using a non - linear least - squares minimization based on the robust levenberg - marquardt method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implemented by @xcite .",
    "the actual computation was done using the mpfit algorithmcraigm / idl / idl.html ] implemented by c.  b. markwardt under the idl environment . in objects with conspicuous stellar absorption features that can not be accounted for by our minimisation routine we checked our results against the line - width and flux measurements obtained with the gandalf software of @xcite , adopting either very young ( 300 myr ) or old ( 10 gyr ) stellar population templates . in most cases the measurements agreed within the errors , except for ic  342 and ngc  7331 where the  absorption line is particularly prominent . for these galaxies we adopted the gandalf values .",
    "finally , in defining our detection thresholds we compared the amplitude ( @xmath25 ) of the best - fitting line profile to the noise level ( @xmath26 ) in the residuals of the continuum fit , adopting as detected only those emission lines for which the @xmath27 ratio was larger than @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitexample ] shows a few sample spectra illustrating the various fitting strategies explained above .",
    "a more detailed description of our emission - line measurements for each of our sample galaxy will be presented with our spectral atlas .    in 14 galaxies the nebular emission was too faint",
    "for it to be detected given the quality of the corresponding spectra , and were consequently dropped from our sample .",
    "three further galaxies had also to be discarded because their line profile could not be well represented as a simple sum of gaussian components .",
    "finally , two galaxies were rejected because the radial profile of the flux of the  lines was strongly asymmetric and not suitable for modelling .",
    "table  1 lists the final sample of galaxies analyzed in this paper , which comprises of 105 galaxies which 28 ( @xmath29 ) are classified as ellipticals , 20 ( @xmath30 ) are lenticulars , and 57 ( @xmath31 ) are spirals .",
    "the central velocity dispersion of the ionized - gas component and the size of the aperture we measured are also given in table  1 .",
    "prior to modeling , the instrumental resolution corresponding to the adopted apertures ( 17  and 32  for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 slit widths , respectively ) was subtracted in quadrature from the observed line - width values to obtain the intrinsic gas velocity dispersion",
    ".    table  2 lists the 74 rejected galaxies .",
    "assuming that the width of the nuclear emission traces the depth of the gravitational well , we can derive stringent upper bounds on the mass of the smbhs in our sample galaxies thanks to the exquisite spatial resolution of hst .",
    "although the stellar contribution to the gravitational potential could affect such estimates , the fundamental reason for which a lower limit on  can not be set from such a simple measurements is that the observed line - broadening may , in principle , be entirely due to additional contributions such as non - gravitational forces ( e.g. , gas pressure or magnetic forces ) .    in this study",
    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite , where a detailed description of the method can be found .",
    "in short , we assume that the observed line - broadening arises from the motion of ionized - gas in a coplanar thin inner disk of unknown inclination , where the gas moves in circular and keplerian orbits around the putative smbhs . for a given radial profile of the nebular emission , perfectly edge - on disks lead to the broadest lines and therefore to a lower estimate of .",
    "conversely , the  value needed to explain the observed line width diverges to infinity as we approach perfectly face - on configurations . fortunately , such extreme orientations are statistically rare .",
    "since randomly oriented disks have uniformly distributed @xmath32 , it is possible to derive @xmath33 upper and lower limits on  by simply considering models with nearly edge - on ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and face - on ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) orientations , respectively , comprising 68% of the distribution of  values that can explain a given line width ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in our models we could disregard the effect on the unknown position angle of the disk since we extracted our spectra in nearly square apertures , and thus assumed that the stis slit was placed along the disk major axis .    clearly , for a given disk orientation the concentration of the gas tracer impacts heavily on the  value needed to explain a given line width , to the point that no lower limit on  can be set when the gas profile is unresolved .",
    "this is why the intrinsic emissivity distribution of the gaseous disk has to be constrained from the data . as in @xcite",
    ", we assumed an intrinsically gaussian flux profile centered on the stellar nucleus , which makes it easier to match the observed flux profile while accounting for instrumental effects .",
    "the choice of a gaussian parametrization is also conservative , since cuspier functions would have led us to estimate smaller .",
    "for instance , adopting an exponential profile for the subsample of objects studied also by @xcite leads on average to a @xmath38 decrease for the  estimates .    in this work we disregarded the contribution of the stellar potential , which would lead to tighter upper limits on . in principle",
    ", it is possible to estimate the stellar mass contribution by deprojecting the stellar surface brightness observed in the stis acquisition images while assuming spherical symmetry and a constant mass - to - light ratio @xcite . in practice , however , this would only be feasible for a limited number of objects in our sample , given the limited quality of the acquisition images for most of our sample galaxies , and the pervasive presence of dust absorption features , in particular in spiral host galaxies .",
    "still , the impact of the stellar potential is unlikely to change dramatically our  estimates , in particular for the upper limits derived for nearly face - on configurations . for their sample of nearby galaxies ( at @xmath39 mpc ) , @xcite found that including the stellar mass contribution reduced the median value of the  upper limits by just @xmath40 . for the median distance our sample ( 21.4 mpc )",
    "the stellar mass contribution to our @xmath41 upper - limits would be @xmath42 .",
    "similar considerations would apply to the  sensitivity limit of our experiment . in the case of the @xcite sample this value",
    "was found to be on average @xmath43 , which is well below most of the  limits derived here and comparable to the smallest  limits obtained for the closest objects in our sample .    to conclude , we note that the range spanned by the two values delivered by our keplerian - disk model includes also  that would be estimated under radically different assumptions .",
    "for instance , the gaseous disk model at @xmath44 is equivalent to that of an isotropic gas sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the  estimates we derived for @xmath36 and @xmath45 are listed in table  1 for the sample galaxies .",
    "although strictly speaking both values should be regarded as upper - limits , we will refer only to the @xmath41  estimates as  upper limits , hereafter .",
    "we have determined the @xmath33 upper and lower confidence limits for the  for randomly orientated disks for 105 galaxies with measurable spectra and stellar velocity dispersions available in the literature . for 19 galaxies of the sample ,",
    "either  measurements or upper limits based on resolved kinematics were available ( table  1 ) .",
    "[ fig : ulcomparison ] shows how such measurements compare with our  limits , once our values are rescaled accordingly to the distances adopted in these studies .",
    "our  upper - limits are consistent within 1@xmath4 with such estimates , except for ngc  3031 and ngc  4261 .",
    "furthermore no systematic offset appears when our upper limits are compared with similar upper bounds in the literature , rather than definite measurements .",
    "a particularly complex blend of narrow +  and broad  lines may have biased our  estimates in ngc  3031 .    to place our  limits on the various versions of the relation , we applied to the aperture correction of @xcite to the literature values of stellar velocity dispersion in order to obtain the values  and and",
    "that would have been measured within a circular aperture of radius @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the effective radii @xmath47 of the spheroidal components of our sample galaxies were taken from various sources in the literature ( table  1 ) except for few disk galaxies for which @xmath47 was obtained from our own photometric decomposition ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the @xmath3-band images retrieved from the archive of the two micron all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : ulmsigmaff05 ] and [ fig : ulmsigmalauer07 ] we compare our  upper limits to the  relation , as given by both @xcite and @xcite , initially to establish the validity of our method over a wide range of velocity dispersions .",
    "our upper bounds show a well defined trend with both  and , running closely above the  and  relations . in the  plane",
    "a spearman s rank coefficient of 0.9 suggests the presence of a correlation at 9@xmath4 confidence level whereas a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8 supports a linear fit to the logaritmic data , which returns a slope of @xmath48 . at first glance such a value would imply a shallower trend than found by @xcite and a slope closer to that of the @xcite relation , but we need to keep in mind that the derived slope could be significantly affected by just a few outliers .",
    "in particular , for small value of @xmath4 our upper - limits could be biased owning to a larger stellar contribution to the gravitational potential in small and distant galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", we found that our limits appear to parallel particularly well both versions of the  relation for @xmath49 , whereas at lower and higher @xmath4 a substantial fraction of our  limits lie either considerably above or almost on top of the  relation , respectively .        in the  interval between @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "our  upper limits appear to correlate particularly well with , paralleling the  relation . in this  region",
    "a value of 0.8 for the spearman s rank correlation coefficient suggests the presence of a correlation at a 7-@xmath4 confidence level , whereas a pearson coefficient of 0.8 indicates that the logarithm values of our  upper limits and  are very likely to be linearly correlated .",
    "a linear fit in the @xmath52 plane delivers a best - fitting slope of @xmath53 for our  upper limits , compared to the @xmath54 slope of the @xcite relation , with a scatter of 0.39 dex ( figs .",
    "[ fig : histograms]a ) . in the @xmath55  interval",
    "we have 66  upper limits , which have a median 2.7 times higher than the expected  value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms]c ) .",
    "these upper - limits can range from falling short of the expected  values by a factor 3.7 to exceeding them by a factor 17.3 , although 68% of them actually do not top the expected  values by more than a factor 4.1 and fall immediately above the  relation . for comparison , by fitting our upper limits in the  plane",
    "we obtain a slope of @xmath56 , very close to the value of @xmath57 found by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the parallel trend of our upper limits holds as far as @xmath58 , with a spearman s rank coefficient of 0.8 , a pearson linear correlation coefficient of 0.8 and a linear slope of @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig : ulmsigmaff05]a shows that such a trend holds independent of galactic distance  objects as far away as 60 mpc appear to run parallel to the  relation . in particular , the objects at and below 20 mpc",
    "are well distributed .",
    "in fact , if in this range of  we perform separate linear regression for the three different populations of upper limits with @xmath60 mpc , @xmath61 mpc and @xmath62 mpc , we find slope values that are consistent within the errors , namely of 4.05@xmath630.51 , 3.51@xmath631.01 , 4.52@xmath631.14 , respectively .",
    "this finding shows that the observed nuclear line widths do not simply trace an increasingly larger subtended stellar mass , as galaxies with progressively larger stellar velocity dispersions are found preferentially at larger distances . instead , the fact that our upper limits scale in the same way with @xmath64 as precisely - measured  determinations indicates that the nuclear emission we measured arises predominantly in regions of the gravitational potential that are dominated by the influence of the central smbhs .",
    "this is not completely unexpected given that a number of hst observations revealed that the narrow - line regions of active nuclei appear to be quite concentrated with scales less than 50 pc , much more so than the underlying stellar density profile ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most recently , @xcite have mapped the behavior of the narrow - line region for galaxies observed with multiple - slit stis observations .",
    "they found that all galaxies of their sample exhibit a centrally peaked surface - brightness profile , with the majority of them further showing a marked gradient of the emission - line widths within the sphere of influence of the central smbh .",
    "the high degree of concentration of the gaseous tracer of the gravitational potential is what allows us to closely trace the presence of the smbh even in objects where formally its sphere of influence is not resolved .",
    "this is similar to the case of the stellar - dynamical estimates of  for m32 , which have not significantly changed when moving from ground- to space - based observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) due to the exceptional concentration of its stellar light profile . actually , that fact that our upper limits run so closely to the relations also suggests that non - gravitational forces do not generally contribute much to the observed line widths ( unless for some reason their importance scales with ) , although their role can not be firmly excluded on a single - case basis .",
    "[ fig : ulmsigmaff05]b also shows that in the @xmath65  range the upper limits derived in galaxies of different hubble types lie neither closer nor further away from the  relation , although only a relatively small number of elliptical galaxies falls in this  interval .",
    "similarly , even though only @xmath66 of the spiral and lenticular galaxies in this  region are unbarred we do not notice any systematic trend with the presence of a bar , unlike what was found by @xcite .",
    "since our upper limits appear to trace quite closely the expected values for , we can take advantage of the significant number of galaxies in our sample to understand whether the objects that within the present  range appear to show remarkably large or small upper - bounds are in fact exceptional . assuming that our @xmath33 limits bracket symmetrically the expected values of  and that our upper bounds lie 2.7 times above the  relation , with the aid of a monte carlo simulation we found that @xmath67 of our  upper limits should lie above the  relation by more than 3 times its scatter ( adopting 0.34 dex by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xmath68 of them should lie below it by more than its scatter .",
    "as fig.[fig : ulmsigmaff05 ] shows , only four out of 66 objects in the @xmath69  range fall that far above the  relation , with an equal number falling below it by more than its scatter . both sets of objects correspond to @xmath70 of the galaxies in the considered  range .",
    "the previous considerations strongly argue against the presence of exceedingly large  ( i.e. , above the  relation by more than 3 times its scatter ) in nearby galactic nuclei , and further suggests that galaxies with considerably smaller -budgets ( i.e. , below the  relation by more than its scatter ) may be particularly rare .",
    "the presence of undermassive smbhs in field galaxies have been suggested for instance by @xcite , who argued that in a low galactic - density environment the  growth may be hampered by the lack of gaseous fuel .",
    "a population of undermassive smbh was discovered also by @xcite in her simulations of the last stages of black - hole mergers , when the binary experiences a recoil due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation . according to fig .",
    "4 of @xcite up to @xmath71 of the galaxies with @xmath55  could contain undermassive smbhs , with less than @xmath38 the expectected .",
    "unfortunately , only a handful of objects in our sample are massive and close enough ( e.g. , for @xmath72  and @xmath73 mpc ) to allow us to probe such a low  regime , where our simulations indicate that we should expect only @xmath74% of our upper - limits .",
    "furthermore , although the wide range of hubble types and of values for  spanned by our sample galaxies suggest these are fairly representative of the general properties of the nearby population , our sample is almost certainly incomplete , in particular as we probe the low - end of the luminosity function where most galaxies are found . our constraints",
    "should therefore be regarded with caution .      at small  ( @xmath2 ) half of our upper limits",
    "systematically exceed the expected  values by 3 times the scatter of the  relation .",
    "they are in average larger by more than a factor 40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms]d ) , consistent with previous works on much more smaller samples @xcite .",
    "they are hosted by ngc  3021 , ngc  4245 , ngc  5347 , ngc  5427 , ngc  5879 , and ugc  1395 , which are late - type spirals with different degrees of nuclear activity , as measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table  1 ) .",
    "we have considered different possibilities related to the measurement and modeling of the  emission line to explain the high values of  found in these 6 objects .",
    "for instance , the presence of broad or asymmetric components in our spectra could affect the width of the narrow component of the lines that we measured and consequently the  upper limits giving larger masses .",
    "a similar bias would be introduced if the extent of the flux profile were to be systematically overestimated .",
    "blue asymmetries are observed in the top outliers ngc  5347 and ngc  5427 , which are also part of the sample of active galactic nuclei studied by @xcite , who investigated the resolved kinematics of their narrow - line region with stis spectra and first reported the presence of blue wings in the  lines . in our fits , however , the contribution of such additional features was isolated using double gaussian profiles . as regards the flux profile of the  doublet of the small - outliers ,",
    "these are not systematically shallower than the other galaxies following the  relation in the same range .",
    "therefore , the  upper limits that we have calculated are not biased by either of these effects .    to explain the largest  upper limits found at low  values we also considered the impact of the presence of a nuclear star cluster ( nc ) , and in general that of a larger stellar contribution due to a greater distance",
    "ncs are massive stellar clusters coincident with the galaxy photocenter @xcite that are found in about @xmath75 of late - type spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "their mean effective radius is @xmath76 pc @xcite , small enough for them to be completely enclosed within the central aperture of our spectra .",
    "@xcite found a different  relation for ncs , with similar slope but a normalization that is larger by roughly an order of magnitude than that the one found for smbhs .",
    "the presence of ncs in our low-  outliers could therefore explain why they show such high central mass concentrations as indicated by their high values . to assess the incidence of ncs in the sample galaxies with @xmath77  we analyzed their surface - brightness radial profile obtained with the iraf task ellipse on the stis acquisition images .",
    "for half of the low-  outliers we could recognize the presence of a nc ( ngc  3021 , ngc  4245 , and ngc  5879 ) . on the other hand , we could identify a nc only in one ( ngc  4212 ) of the six galaxies ( @xmath78 ) which run close to the  relation ( ic  342 , ngc  2685 , ngc  2748 , ngc  3982 , ngc  4212 , and ngc  5194 ) .",
    "the presence of a nc in the galaxies at the low-  end of our sample is shown in fig .",

    "if our limits trace indeed the dynamical signature of a nc in these nuclei , better data and more detailed modelling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be required to disentagle the contribution of the nc and smbh to the total mass budget . as regards the distance of the low-  outliers , although we can only rely on distances inferred from their recessional velocities it is significant that half of them ( ngc  5347 , ngc  5427 , and ugc  1395 ) are found beyond 30 mpc , whereas all the other low-  galaxies are significantly closer , including those for which our  upper limits lie well within 3 times the scatter of  relation .",
    "these findings suggest that part , if not all , of the exceedingly large  values we found at the low-  end of the  relation could be ascribed to a more significant stellar contribution to the gravitational potential .",
    "this is either because of the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster ( in ngc  3021 , ngc  4245 , and ngc  5879 ) or due to a larger galactic distance ( for ngc  5347 , ngc  5427 , and ugc  1395 ) than otherwise required to trace the  relation at these regimes .",
    "therefore , we presently do not need to invoke either non - gravitational forces ( see * ? ? ? * ) or a population of more massive smbhs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to explain the observed flattening of the  relation at low  values",
    ".      at high  ( @xmath79 ) our  upper limits nicely bracket the  relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms]e ) and most of them are consistent with its scatter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ulmsigmaff05 ] ) .",
    "in fact , only four objects ( @xmath80 ; ngc  2911 , ngc  4552 , ngc  4594 , and ngc  5077 ) fall above the  relation by more than its scatter , with the same number of galaxies falling as far below the  relation ( ngc  3998 , ngc  4278 , ngc  6861 , and ugc  1841 ) .",
    "these outliers do not stand out from the rest of the objects with @xmath81  for any obvious property such as morphology , nuclear activity or distance .",
    "this behavior is suggestive of an actual flattening of the high - mass end of  relation , in particular considering that in the most massive and radio - loud galaxies the ionized - gas velocity dispersion can show a significant excess over a purely gravitational model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the flattening at high-@xmath4 values is less evident when our upper limits are compared to the shallower  relation of @xcite , but is nonetheless present upon closer inspection . in particular , excluding objects with @xmath82  where the impact of the stellar potential on our  estimates could be more important , we found a systematic flattening in the main trend of our upper limits as the high-  end of the  plane is progressively populated .",
    "specifically , whereas a linear fit to objects with @xmath83  yields a slope of @xmath56 (  3.3 ) , extending this range to @xmath84 , @xmath85  and up to the maximum  value in our sample of 386  results in best - fitting values of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "this finding would be in agreement with the predictions of semi - analytic models for the coevolution of smbhs and galaxies at the highest end of the mass spectrum , whereby galaxies and smbhs grow mainly via gas - poor , dry mergers @xcite .",
    "yet , the behavior of  relation in this regime is still under debate . in particular ,",
    "the limited number of galaxies with reliable  measurement in the range @xmath89  are actually consistent with a steepening of the  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the cutoff at @xmath90  of the local velocity dispersion function @xcite implies either that smbhs with @xmath91  are extremely rare or that if they exists their host galaxies should lay considerably above the present  relation .",
    "in fact , at these regimes @xcite argue that the stellar luminosity @xmath92 is better suited than  to trace .",
    "the  relation should steepen at its high-  end if lauer et al .",
    "arguments are correct , since the observed  saturates for the most massive of ellipticals while considering increasingly large values of @xmath92 .",
    "although our results suggest a flattening of the  relation , we need to keep in mind that systematic effects related to the measurement of the bulge properties may be significant at the high-  end of the  plane .",
    "in particular , the aperture correction for the stellar velocity dispersion may be both more important and more uncertain for the most massive of ellipticals than for smaller elliptical and lenticular galaxies . indeed , giant ellipticals tend to have shallower central surface brightness profiles than their less massive counterparts , which makes the aperture correction more sensitive to the quality and spatial coverage of the stellar kinematics and to uncertainties on the value of the galaxy effective radius , @xmath47 .",
    "incidentally , measurements or @xmath47 are also generally less accurate for giant ellipticals , due the presence of extended stellar halos . ideally , rather than  one would like to have a quantity that is more closely connected to the stellar mass , such as the total @xmath3-band luminosity , which is also known to relate to @xcite , or a _ direct _ measurement of .",
    "obtaining the @xmath3-band luminosity of our sample galaxies would require much deeper images than the available 2mass data , whereas properly measuring  requires integral - field observations , such as those derived in the case of the sauron survey @xcite .",
    "owing to the exquisite spatial resolution of hst and to the concentrated character of the ionized - gas emission in low - luminosity agns , we have been able to set tight upper limits on  for a sample of 105 nearby galaxies ( @xmath93 ) using stis / g750 m spectra .",
    "this sample spans a wide range of hubble types ( with 54% of spirals ) and includes objects with published values for their central stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "our main findings are :    * independent of the galaxy distance , our  upper limits run parallel and above the  relation , in particular for values of  between 90 and 220 .",
    "the median of the 66   upper limits in this  regime exceeds the expected   value by a factor 2.7 , with 68% of our upper limits falling immediately above the  relation and without exceeding the expected  values by more than a factor 4.1 . * that our nebular line - width measurements trace rather well the nuclear gravitational potential , makes large samples of upper - limit measurements useful in constraining the frequency of objects with exceedingly low or high values of  and in probing the black - hole mass budget across the entire hubble sequence . * no systematic trends or offsets",
    "are observed in this   range as a function of the galaxy hubble type , or with respect to the presence of a bar .",
    "furthermore , no evidence was found to suggest that the largest or smallest  upper limit in the  range between 90 and 220  are actually bracketing exceptionally high or low values of .",
    "thus , galaxies with exceedingly high budgets must be very rare .",
    "* for  values below 90  half of our  upper limits systematically exceed the expected  values by more than a factor 40 , consistent with previous work on much smaller samples .",
    "+ the line - width measurements for such low-  outliers are most likely affected by the stellar contribution to the gravitational potential , either due to the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster or because of a greater distance compared to the other galaxies at the low-  end of the  relation , for which our  upper limits are closer to the expected   values .",
    "* at the opposite  end of the  relation , for values of  above 220 , our  upper bounds appear to lie much closer the expected  in the most massive elliptical galaxies , even falling below the  relation .",
    "this flattening is less evident when our upper limits are compared with the shallower  relation by @xcite , but is nonetheless present upon closer inspection . in particular , excluding objects with @xmath94",
    ", we found a systematic flattening in the main trend of our upper limits as the high-  end of the  plane is progressively populated .",
    "+ although such a flattening of the  relations at its high-  end would appear consistent with models for the coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies driven by dry mergers , we caution that better and more consistent measurements for either the @xmath3-band luminosity or the integrated value of the stellar velocity dispersion   within the bulge effective radius @xmath47 ( both better tracers of the bulge mass than ) are needed before systematic effects can be ruled out",
