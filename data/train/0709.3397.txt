    "we find that the magnetoconductance oscillations in a multimode graphene ring with valley - filtering point contacts show the expected @xmath1 periodicity if the two filters have the same polarity .",
    "for opposite polarity , however , a period doubling appears : the lowest harmonic is suppressed while the second and higher harmonics are unaffected or enhanced .",
    "we attribute the period doubling to intervalley scattering , which is more effective for electrons that have travelled more than once along the ring .    in few - mode",

    "a feature of the nonsinusoidal magnetoconductance oscillations shown in fig .  [ gfi ] , and quantified by the fourier transform in fig .",

    "the suppression of the first harmonic indicates that electrons which travel only once along the ring have a small probability for intervalley scattering and can therefore not contribute to the conductance when the two constrictions have opposite valley polarization .",

    "because the boundaries of the ring are not uniform , the number of propagating modes in the ring is not well - defined .",

    "in conclusion , we have identified signatures of valley polarization in the magnetoconductance of an aharonov - bohm interferometer in graphene .",
    "the suppression of the lowest harmonic of the conductance oscillations that appears when the two point contacts have opposite valley polarity indicates that electrons which have travelled only once along the ring preserve their valley polarization , and therefore can not contribute to the conductance .",
    "the special case of a single - mode hexagonal ring shows nearly sinusoidal magnetoconductance oscillations around a greatly suppressed average conductance , attributed to a current blocking effect at a vertex where two zigzag edges meet at an angle of @xmath54 .",
    "this current blocking is not a special feature of the hexagonal geometry .",
    "instead , we have found the same current blocking in a circular ring with irregularly shaped boundaries .",
    "this finding is consistent with a recent theory for the boundary condition of a terminated honeycomb lattice at an arbitrary crystallographic orientation @xcite .",
    "it is found that the zigzag boundary condition applies generically for any angle @xmath88 of the boundary ( where @xmath89 labels the armchair orientation ) .",
