    "the motion of colloidal particles on modulated surfaces has attracted a great deal of attention in the past decade @xcite .",
    "the interest in this subject has mainly been directed at sorting phenomena , and a considerable portion of the work has been experimental .",
    "the work has focused on mixtures of particles which are sorted into separate streams of different species when the mixture is transported under laminar conditions along a structured or modulated medium with periodic obstacles or traps . in this scenario",
    "it is possible to control the transport of materials such as dna fragments or functionalized biological colloidal particles .",
    "the modulated surfaces are specifically designed to present periodic arrays of traps  @xcite or microfabricated obstacles  @xcite among other configurations .",
    "this technique can be applied not only to solid spherical particles but also to other objects such as cells , proteins , dna , and droplets in inmimiscible fluids  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies complemented with stochastic simulations have received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "other sorting methods based on inertia and hydrodynamics have also been explored  @xcite .",
    "the sorting phenomenon consists of a lateral or orthogonal displacement of the particles with respect to the driving force or velocity direction of the fluid mixture .",
    "the deviation of the particles in a mixture from the direction of flow of the mixture depends on some property or group of properties of the particles such as , for instance , size , mass , or charge , causing the particles with different values of these properties to flow in different directions .",
    "the same principle can be used to achieve the converse effect , namely , to focus particles coming from different directions and mix them if the modulated structure of obstacles or traps is prepared accordingly  @xcite . focusing of particles is useful in a number of different scenarios such as counting , detecting , and mixing  @xcite .",
    "this property has special relevance in the laminar regime , where slow molecular diffusion makes it difficult to concentrate and mix particles .",
    "our particular focus in this work lies in using this methodology to mix reactants in order to speed their reaction .",
    "it is our objective to show that using an appropriate modulated or structured surface of obstacles one can concentrate two reactants in a very small domain , thus favoring their chemical reaction .",
    "our main result is that reactants that arise from non - homogeneous distributions can be efficiently mixed and as a result are able to reach the classical law of mass action reaction regime characterized by the reactant concentration decay law @xmath2 much sooner than they would in the absence of a mixing mechanism .",
    "we present results on the efficiency of some obstacle geometries toward this purpose .",
    "we discuss the roles of the different control parameters and of the densities , the diffusion coefficients of the different species , the reaction rates , and the particle and obstacle sizes .",
    "our presentation proceeds as follows .",
    "first in sec",
    ".  [ sec2 ] we begin with the description of the continuous dynamical scenario and present the associated dynamical equations which contain diffusion , advection and reaction terms . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present numerical results from the simulation of the equations and thereby analyze the roles of the different parameters .",
    "finally we close with some conclusions and perspectives in sec .",
    "the theoretical scenario is the advective reaction  diffusion model of chemical kinetics corresponding to the simple irreversible reaction @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamical equations for the two reactants are    [ eq:1 ] @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the time dependent local concentrations of the reactants @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the reaction rate constant , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the fluxes of the reactants .",
    "the latter are given by    @xmath12    here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the diffusion coeficients , @xmath15 is the modulated potential interaction due to obstacles , and @xmath16 is the local velocity responsible for the advective flux , which we assume to be a hele - shaw flow ( that is , a flow between two very close parallel plates ) . we have explicitly extracted the amplitude @xmath17 of the potential so that @xmath18 is the potential of unit amplitude .",
    "this potential is modeled by placing a circular tower at each obstacle , which changes from unit value at the center of the disk defining the base of the obstacle to a zero value outside the range of the interaction .",
    "specifically , it is modeled by the expression @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , are the positions of the centers of the @xmath22 obstacles of base radius @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the radius of the interaction , and @xmath25 is the ( small ) scale that characterizes a substantial change in the value of the potential . to take into account the finite size of the advected particles in a model with a continuous concentration field we have introduced an interaction potential with a radius @xmath26 larger than the obstacle radius @xmath23 .",
    "the distance @xmath27 then represents the particle radius ( see fig .",
    "[ lines ] ) .",
    "the potential range @xmath26 corresponds to the minimum distance between the centers of the colloidal particle and the obstacle , and hence is the sum of their radii .",
    "the flow field is obtained by solving the laplace equation with boundary conditions that reflect the presence of the @xmath22 circular obstacles of radius @xmath23 , but neglecting any effects that the advected particles might have on the flow .",
    "even this is a rather arduous task that we have moved to the appendix .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be simplified with a change to the new variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are characteristic length and time scales .",
    "this transforms eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) to    @xmath34    [ eq:1-b ]    the dimensionless parameters are given by @xmath35 and the concentrations and derivative operators are also dimensionless .",
    "we fix the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 throughout the paper . from now on for simplicity of notation we drop the primes on @xmath29 and @xmath30 and alert the reader not to confuse @xmath38 and @xmath39 as used henceforth with the original variables .    the equations are simulated on a two - dimensional lattice of @xmath40 cell centers and cell dimensions ( dimensionless quantities ) @xmath41 , which corresponds to system dimensions @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "our integration time step is @xmath44 .",
    "the dynamical evolution is reported every @xmath45 time units up to a final time @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ lines ] shows the role of one obstacle , the flow lines and the finite size of a colloidal particle .",
    "when the particle following a flux line is close to the obstacle its trajectory changes to a different flow line pointing away from the obstacle .",
    "the result is a lateral deviation of the particle from the initial flow line as it circumnavigates the obstacle . in the presence of several obstacles , and depending on their specific spatial distribution",
    ", these deviations can favor focusing and hence accelerate the reaction . to check this hypothesis",
    "we have employed two obstacle patterns , one with 293 obstacles in a tilted periodic pattern ( pp ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1evol_i ] , and a second one with the same number of obstacles but distributed randomly over the same area ( random pattern , rp ) .",
    "we have also performed some simulations with no pattern ( np ) .",
    "we have mainly used obstacles of radius @xmath47 and an interaction potential radius @xmath48 , which corresponds to a radius @xmath49 of reacting particles .",
    "we have also used the values @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in some cases in order to study the dependence of the results on these parameters .",
    "we have also performed some simulations in which the flow is not affected by the obstacles and thus the particles move at a constant velocity , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath53 constant ( @xmath54 , see below .",
    "this is done because in previous calculations concerning flows of particle mixtures over surfaces with obstacles we did not take the effect of the obstacles on the flow field into account @xcite .",
    "here we have the opportunity to assess the importance of doing so ( see below ) .",
    "+    we are interested in a number of observables along the flow direction , and not in a direction perpendicular to the flow , which we integrate over .",
    "the observables we focus on are the local reaction rate @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the total flux as a function of the position @xmath38 , @xmath57.\\ ] ] from this quantity the reaction efficiency at a long time ( here taken as @xmath58 ) is evaluated comparing the fluxes of non reacted particles at two points , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61    in fig .",
    "[ 1evol_i ] we present the two - dimensional landscape in which the advection , diffusion , and reaction of the two components @xmath7 and @xmath8 takes place .",
    "one can see the periodic and tilted structure of the circular obstacles .",
    "figure  [ 2evol_i ] ( top ) shows the distribution of both concentrations at time @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear that the obstacles focus the concentrations toward the center line , where most of the reaction process takes place .",
    "this situation should be compared with the case of randomly distributed obstacles , fig .",
    "[ 2evol_i ] ( bottom ) .",
    "in fig . [ prof_k0 ] we present initial and final concentration profiles .",
    "the left column shows the effect of obstacles on the flow of reactants in the absence of a reaction ( @xmath62 ) . from top to bottom we see the reactant flow patterns when the obstacles are placed in the tilted periodic pattern ( pp ) , in the random placement ( rp ) , and without obstacles ( np ) .",
    "we clearly see the strong focusing effect of the pp geometry compared to the other cases . in the right column",
    "we see the same three cases but now the two species are allowed to react with rate coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "the reaction clearly proceeds much more rapidly when the reactants are focused by the obstacles .",
    "the reaction in the presence of random obstacles and of no obstacles occurs more slowly and at comparable speeds in the two cases , the former slightly more rapidly than the latter . in fig .",

    "( [ rx ] ) and the flux @xmath64 of eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) in the steady state are plotted for the focusing geometry ( pp ) along the flow direction .",
    "we observe repeated positions at which the reaction is more efficient .",
    "these points correspond to rows where the innermost focusing obstacles are closest together .",
    "this result opens the possibility of alternative patterns with more active reaction domains .",
    "the flux is shown for the focusing obstacle geometry for a number of rate coefficients and is seen to be a monotonically decaying function of position . for the focusing obstacle geometry with @xmath65 , for instance , we calculate a reaction efficiency of @xmath66 , a fairly high value for such a relatively small system . in fig .",
    "[ efficiency ] we explore the dependence of the efficiency on the reaction parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we see that the efficiency comes close to a maximum value around @xmath63 , with little improvement above that .",
    "this almost - independence of the rate coefficient is an interesting unanticipated feature .",
    "+   +     +    it is informative to compare this efficiency with that obtained in the most effective case , that is , that of perfect ( totally homogeneous ) mixing . in this case , assuming equal initial concentrations @xmath68 .",
    "the reaction equation is @xmath69 its solution is @xmath70    we choose the comparison time @xmath71 .",
    "if we further choose @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we find that @xmath74 which gives an efficiency @xmath75 .",
    "this an upper bound for this setup .",
    "the focusing configuration thus leads to almost perfect mixing .",
    "we can use this result to obtain an analytic estimate for the efficiency .",
    "if we take the velocity of the flowing components @xmath76 we can substitute time for space , @xmath77 .",
    "we expect the flux to have a functional form similar to that of the concentration in eq .",
    "( [ pmixing ] ) , and thus we propose the following expresion for the efficiency at @xmath78 : @xmath79 with parameters @xmath23 and @xmath80 to be fitted",
    ". a nonlinear fit to our numerical data yields @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( pp ) , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( rp ) and @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( np ) . in fig .",
    "[ efficiency ] we have plotted this function for @xmath87 .",
    "this numerical result implies that most of the reacted matter was in the perfect mixing regime characterized by the decay @xmath88 .",
    "this is an unexpected result because of the inhomogeneous concentrations in this system .",
    "it tells us that the reaction is dominated by the small domains near the center of the array where there is quasi - perfect mixing , as is seen in fig . [",
    "2evol_i ] .    to complete our analysis",
    ", we will explore the effects on these results of varying the diffusion coefficient ( assumed to be the same for both species ) , the focusing pattern geometry , and the sizes of obstacles and particles . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ diff ] we present the effect of the diffusion parameter .",
    "we indicate the focusing domain for the case of our focusing obstacle pattern by dashed lines , that is , the focusing takes place within this domain .",
    "we see that inside this region the reaction is dominated by focusing , but outside of this region the reaction is dominated by diffusion .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ diff ] we present three fluxes that correspond to different geometries .",
    "we see that the flux with the focusing pattern decays faster than the random pattern which is also more effective than no pattern at all .",
    "+    finally we discuss the effect of the parameters @xmath26 ( radius of potential interaction ) and @xmath23 ( radius of the obstacles ) on the reaction efficiency . from fig .",
    "[ radius ] we can see that the stronger effect comes from the change in the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "a comparison of pairs of curves with a common value of @xmath23 shows that the reactant flux is strongly reduced by increasing @xmath26 from 0.20 to 0.25 .",
    "this reduction in the flux implies an increment in the efficiency ( see inset of fig .  [ radius ] ) , as follows . returning to fig .",
    "[ lines ] , we see that larger @xmath26 means that more stream lines of the liquid flow are affected by the potential , and as a consequence more particles traveling along the stream lines are deviated . moreover , the deviation of each particle will be greater , that is , particles are moved to further stream lines .",
    "an increase of @xmath26 then clearly produces a larger focussing effect of the reacting particles , and as a consequence the reaction is enhanced .",
    "note that such a change in the parameter @xmath26 with fixed @xmath23 corresponds to a change in the particle radius @xmath27 ( a change in the reactants ) while maintaining the same pattern of obstacles .",
    "next we fix the parameter @xmath26 and explore the role of the parameter @xmath23 . in fig .",
    "[ radius ] we see that an increase in @xmath23 reduces the efficiency ( see inset ) .",
    "the explanation again lies in the fact that the obstacles lead to a deformation of the stream lines ( see fig .  [ lines ] ) , and this effect is stronger for larger @xmath23 . with a stronger deformation",
    "the stream lines are displaced further from the obstacles , and as a result more particles can escape from the action of the interaction potential , whose range @xmath26 is now held fixed . as a consequence",
    "the increase of @xmath23 at fixed @xmath26 reduces the focussing effect of the pattern and hence the reaction efficiency decreases .",
    "perhaps most interesting from an experimental point of view is to analyze the effect of varying both @xmath23 and @xmath26 while maintaining their difference constant .",
    "this corresponds to changing the dimensions of the obstacles , easily modified in an experiment , while keeping the particle radius @xmath27 constant .",
    "this would be the scenario in which one attempts to optimize the reaction process for given reactive species . in fig .",
    "[ radius ] we can compare the case @xmath89 with the case @xmath90 , which corresponds to changing the obstacle size with a common particle radius of @xmath49 .",
    "results in the figure show that the increase of obstacle size in this example clearly reduces the reactant flux and hence improves the reaction efficiency .    as a last test ,",
    "we have compared these results to those of approximation in which the deformation of the fluid flow is neglected , _",
    "i.e. _ , in which the flow velocity is taken to be constant and only the scale @xmath26 of the interaction potential is taken into account . in fig .  [ lines ] this situation would correspond to straight , horizontal stream lines .",
    "this approximation was used in our previous work on particle sorting @xcite , and in our present scheme corresponds to the limit @xmath91 .",
    "in this situation the stream lines are not deformed and hence a larger number of particles are deviated by the potential . in fig .",
    "[ radius ] we see the expected result , namely , that this approximation overestimates the reaction efficiency when compared to a finite @xmath23 value ( for a given value of @xmath26 ) . for the smallest values of @xmath23",
    "( obstacles smaller than the particles ) this approximation does not qualitatively change the focussing scenario , but as @xmath23 increases the importance of including the effects of advection clearly increases .",
    "obstacles placed in carefully selected geometrical patterns have been used in the past to effectively separate colloidal mixtures that are caused to flow over a surface containing such obstacles . in this paper",
    "we have explored the converse , namely , the possibility of speeding up the mixing of components that undergo advective diffusion over a surface containing carefully situated obstacles .",
    "we have illustrated the effects of this mixing by considering the reaction of two species and comparing the reaction rates when the species are allowed to mix by ordinary advective diffusion in the absence and presence of these obstacles .",
    "we have shown that a periodic pattern of tilted obstacles , as opposed to a random placement , is able to effectively focus the streams of reactive species .",
    "we have furthermore shown that this focusing mechanism leads rather rapidly to reaction rates comparable to those obtained with perfect mixing .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the reaction efficiency on the different parameters of the problem .",
    "we interpret the focusing mechanism as a consequence of the finite size of the reacting particles .",
    "these results could be useful for the design and interpretation of new experiments .",

    "the velocity of the fluid far from the obstacles is @xmath99 . at the rigid boundaries the velocity satisfies the condition of zero normal component , but not the no - slip boundary condition .",
    "the stream lines passing the obstacles are identical to those of a two dimensional inviscid fluid with the same geometry @xcite .      the general solution of the 2d laplace equation ( [ eq - laplace ] )",
    "can be written in polar coordinates as @xmath103 where @xmath104 are constants that depend on the boundary conditions .",
    "it is easy to establish that for real @xmath100 these constants should satisfy @xmath105    we will use the multipole expansion ( [ eq - genlaplace ] ) for the velocity field in the neighbhood of each disk , with the polar coordinates centered at the disk . hence we will have @xmath22 such expansions .",
    "the advantage of these expansions is that the boundary conditions at the disks are easy to formulate . in particular ,",
    "the normal velocity vanishes , that is , @xmath106 and then , taking into account the conditions eqs .  ( [ eq - condition1 ] ) and ( [ eq - condition2 ] )",

    "we next consider the ensemble of @xmath22 disks .",
    "all multipole expansions should simultaneously satisfy boundary conditions on all the discs and at infinity .",
    "it is convenient to employ a complex variable for the position , @xmath110 we define the complex position @xmath111 as @xmath112 henceforth a tilde on any vector will denote a similar definition as a complex variable . by employing this notation the general solution eq .",
