    "this initially appears surprising if the uv and x - ray absorbers are connected .",
    "one possible explanation is that the low - resolution _ rosat _ data were confused by complex x - ray spectral variability ; changes in the power - law continuum and/or soft excess could have created a false impression of ionized absorption variability .",

    "the optical continuum of ngc4051 varies little ( e.g. , shemmer et  al .",

    "the uv and fuv spectra do not show indications for a big blue bump .",
    "such an observed sed could be explained by dust along the line of sight which reddens the optical - to - fuv spectrum and re - emits energy in the far - ir .",
    "this would be similar to the observed sed of ark564 in which significant reddening was found ( crenshaw et  al .",
    "2002 ; romano et  al .",
    "however , data from _ euve _ and _ rosat _ strongly constrain the amount of cold gas along the line of sight that could be associated with the putative dust ( e.g. , mchardy et  al . 1995 ; uttley et  al .",
    "one solution to this difficulty could be to invoke an ionized absorber with embedded dust ( e.g. , brandt , fabian , & pounds 1996 ; kraemer et  al .",
    "2000 ) , although even in this case there is little evidence at present for x - ray absorption edges from the dust grains themselves ( e.g. , komossa & fink 1997 ) .",

    "1987 ; elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "further evidence against a dust - reddening interpretation comes from consideration of the  @xmath150 ratio .",
    "we estimate the observed ratio to be a surprisingly high @xmath151 from a stis measurement of the  @xmath152 line [ @xmath153 ^-2s^-1 erg@xmath77s@xmath2 ; collinge et  al .",
    "2001 ] and a ground - based measurement of the  @xmath154 line [ @xmath155 ^-2s^-1 erg@xmath77s@xmath2 ; peterson et  al .",
    "such a value is not supportive of a reddening interpretation which predicts the ratio to be @xmath156 ( compare with crenshaw et  al .",
    "if the continuum is reddened then the absorption at 1640    is @xmath157 times larger than at 4686    ( by comparing the observed local - continuum flux ratio in figure  [ sed ] to what is seen in a normal agn ) .",
    "such absorption would be expected to produce a  @xmath150 ratio of @xmath158 .",
    "while our measured line ratio should be treated with caution since variability can add a factor of @xmath8 to the uncertainty , it still seems significantly higher than the expected ratio from reddening .",
    "more accurate and simultaneous measurements of this and other line ratios are needed to confirm this result .",
    "an alternative to models with significant reddening is that , perhaps due to its low black hole mass ( shemmer et al .",
    "2003 ) , ngc4051 may have a high - temperature big blue bump that is not apparent even in the fuv ( compare our figure  [ sed ] with figure  3 of puchnarewicz et  al . 1995 ) .",
    "discrimination between significant reddening and a high - temperature big blue bump is challenging , and we leave this task to a future study .",
    "for example , it will be necessary to determine unambiguously if the observed excess soft x - ray emission is due to a continuum soft x - ray excess ( e.g. , collinge et  al .",
    "2001 ) or a relativistically broadened recombination spectrum ( ogle et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "using three _ fuse _ observations , we have presented the first measurements of the fuv spectral and variability properties of the intensively studied nls1 ngc4051 .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .",
    "ngc4051 shows no significant fuv variability in either its continuum or line properties during three epochs spanning about one year . 2 .",
    "we detect fuv emission lines from , , , and as well as blueshifted absorption lines from , , and .",
    "the fuv absorption is generally coincident in velocity with the uv absorption seen by stis , although the lower fuv spectral resolution limits our ability to resolve all of the absorption complexity seen in the uv .",
    "there is no evidence for new velocity components seen only in higher ionization fuv lines .",
    "the fuv absorption appears coincident in velocity with only the lowest velocity ( @xmath138  ^-1 kms@xmath2 ) x - ray absorption system known .",
    "the several claimed x - ray absorption systems at higher velocities are not detected in the fuv , although this does not rule out the existence of these systems .",
    "the lyman series absorption lines are detected up to the lyman edge , and two main velocity systems are seen in these lines .",
    "column density estimates for these two systems indicate that the column density is lower for systems with larger outflow velocities .",
    "a possible third velocity system is also seen .",
    "any line - of - sight acceleration of the fuv absorption is constrained to be @xmath159  mm  s@xmath129 .",
    "the deep absorption troughs imprinted on the and broad emission lines indicate that the fuv absorbing material resides at least @xmath135  cm from the central continuum source .",
