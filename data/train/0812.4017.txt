    "the lower levels of the atmosphere are usually strongly influenced by the earth s surface .",
    "known as the atmospheric boundary layer , this is the part of the atmosphere where the surface influences the temperature , moisture , and velocity of the air above through the turbulent transfer of mass .",
    "the stability of the atmospheric boundary layer depends on the profiles of the density and the temperature as a function of the height above the ground . during normal summer days",
    "the land mass warms up and the temperature is higher at lower elevations . if it were not for the decrease in density of the air as a function of the height , such a situation of heating from below would have been always highly unstable .",
    "in fact , the boundary layer is considered stable as long as the temperature decreases at the dry adiabatic lapse rate ( @xmath0 per kilometer ) throughout most of the boundary layer .",
    "with such a rate of cooling one balances out the decrease in density . with a higher degree of cooling one refers to the atmospheric boundary layer as unstably stratified , whereas with a lower degree of cooling the situation is stably stratified .",
    "stably stratified boundary layer occurs typically during clear , calm nights . in extreme cases turbulence tends to cease , and radiational cooling from the surface results in a temperature that increases with height above the surface .",
    "the tendency of the atmosphere to be turbulent does not depend only on the rate of cooling but also on the mean shear in the vertical direction .",
    "the commonly used parameter to describe the tendency of the atmosphere to be turbulent is the ",

    "the parameter @xmath13 represents the ratio of the generation or suppression of turbulence by buoyant production of energy to the mechanical generation of energy by wind shear .",
    "this paper is an extended presentation of an invited talk given on international conference ",
    "turbulent mixing and beyond \" devoted , in particular , to the problems of fluid dynamics , turbulence , geophysics and statistics , that are long - standing challenging tasks .",
    "here we consider the description of stably stratified turbulent boundary layers ( tbl ) , taking as an example the case of stable thermal stratification .",
    "since the 50 s of twentieth century , traditional models of stratified tbl generalize models of unstratified tbl , based on the budget equations for the kinetic energy and mechanical momentum ; see reviews of umlauf and burchard ( 2005 ) , weng and taylor ( 2003 ) .",
    "the main difficulty is that the budget equations are not closed ; they involve turbulent fluxes of mechanical moments @xmath14 ( known as the  reynolds stress \" tensor ) and a thermal flux @xmath15 ( for the case of thermal stratification ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the turbulent fluctuating velocity and the potential temperature with zero mean .",
    "the nature of the averaging procedure behind the symbol @xmath19 will be specified below .",
    "earlier estimates of the fluxes  ( [ def3 ] ) are based on the concept of the down - gradient turbulent transport , in which , similarly to the case of molecular transport , a flux is taken proportional to the gradient of transported property times a corresponding ( turbulent ) transport coefficient :    [ dt ] @xmath20    here the turbulent - eddy viscosity @xmath21 and turbulent thermal conductivity @xmath22 are estimated by dimensional reasoning via the vertical turbulent velocity @xmath23 and a scale @xmath24 ( which in the simplest case is determined by the elevation @xmath3 ) .",
    "the dimensionless coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 are assumed to be of the order of unity .",
    "this approach meets serious difficulties ( zeman , 1981 ) , in particular , it predicts full suppression of turbulence when the stratification exceeds a critical level , for which @xmath27 . on the other hand , in observations of the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer turbulence exists for much larger values than @xmath28 : experimentally above @xmath29 and even more ( see galperin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and references therein ) . in models for weather predictions",
    "this problem is  fixed \" by introducing fit functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 instead of the constant @xmath32 and @xmath26 in the model parametrization ( [ dt ] ) .",
    "this technical  solution \" is not based on any physical derivation and just masks the shortcomings of the model . to really solve the problem one has to understand its physical origin , even though from a purely formal viewpoint it is indeed possible that a dimensionless coefficient like @xmath26 can be any function of @xmath13 .    to expose the physical reason for the failure of the down - gradient approach , recall that in a stratified flow , in the presence of gravity , the turbulent kinetic energy is _ not _ an integral of motion .",
    "only the total mechanical energy , the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy , is conserved in the inviscid limit . as it was shown already by richardson ,",
    "the difficult point is that an important contribution to the potential energy comes not just from the mean density profile , but from the density fluctuations . clearly ,",
    "any reasonable model of the turbulent boundary layer must obey the conservation laws .",
    "the physical requirement of conserving the total mechanical energy calls for an explicit consideration not only of the mean profiles , but also of _ all _ the relevant second - order , one - point , simultaneous correlation functions of _ all _ the fluctuating fields together with some closure procedure for the appearing third order moments .",
    "first of all , in order to account for the important effect of stratification on the anisotropy , we must write explicit equations for the entire reynolds stress tensor , @xmath33 .",
    "next , in the case of the temperature stratified turbulent boundary layers we follow tradition [ see , e.g. zeeman ( 1981 ) , hunt et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , schumann and gerz ( 1995 ) , hanazaki and hunt ( 2004 ) , keller and van atta ( 2000 ) , stretch et al .",

    "( 2002 ) , and rehmann and hwang ( 2005 ) ] and account for the turbulent potential energy which is proportional to the variance of the potential temperature deviation , @xmath34 . and last but not least , we have to consider explicitly equations for the vertical fluxes , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which include the down gradient terms proportional to the velocity and temperature gradients , and counter - gradient terms , proportional to @xmath37 ( in the equation for @xmath35 ) and to @xmath38 ( in the equation for @xmath36 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting second order closure seems to be inconsistent with the variety of boundary - layer data , and many authors took the liberty to introduce additional fitting parameters and sometimes fitting functions to achieve a better agreement with the data ( see reviews of umlauf and burchard ( 2005 ) , weng and taylor ( 2003 ) , zeeman , ( 1981 ) , melor and yamada ( 1974 ) , and references therein ) . moreover , in the second order closures the problem of critical richardson number seems to persists ( cheng et al .",
    ", 2002 ; canuto , 2002 ) .",
    "notice that in spite of obvious inconsistency of the first - order schemes , most of the practically used turbulent models are based on the concept of the down - gradient transport .",
    "one of the reasons is that in the second - order schemes instead of two down - gradient equations  ( [ dt ] ) one needs to take into account eight nonlinear coupled additional equations i.e. four equations for the reynolds stresses , three equations for the heat fluxes and equation for the temperature variance . as the result , the second - order schemes have seemed to be rather cumbersome for comprehensive analytical treatment and have allowed to find only some relationships between correlation functions ( see , e.g. , cheng et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical solutions to the complete set of the second - order schemes equations which involve too many fitting parameters are much less informative in clarification of physical picture of the phenomenon than desired analytical ones .",
    "in this paper we suggest a relatively simple second - order closure model of turbulent boundary layer with stable temperature stratification that , from one hand , accounts for main relevant physics in the stratified tbl and , from the other hand , is simple enough to allow complete analytical treatment including the problem of critical ri@xmath39 . to reach this goal",
    "we approximate the third order correlations via the first- and second - order ones , accounting only for the most physically important terms .",
    "we will try to expose the approximations in a clear and logical way , providing the physical justification as we go along .",
    "resulting second - order model consist of nine coupled equations for the mean velocity and temperature gradients , four components of the reynolds stresses , two components of the temperature fluxes and the temperature variance .",
    "thanks to the achieved simplicity of the model we found an approximate analytical solution of these equations , expressing all nine correlations as functions of only one governing parameter , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the outer scale of turbulence ( depending on the elevation @xmath3 and also known as the  dissipation scale \" ) and @xmath42  is the obukhov length .",
    "we would like also to stress , that in our approach @xmath40 is an external parameter of the problem . for small elevations @xmath43",
    ", it is well accepted that @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath3 , while the @xmath41 dependence is still under debate for @xmath3 comparable or exceeding @xmath42 . for @xmath44 the assignment and discussion of the actual dependence of the outer scale of turbulence , @xmath41 , which is manifested in the nature is out of the scope of this paper , and is remained for future work . at time being , we can analyze consequences of our approach for the following versions of @xmath41 dependence at @xmath45 : +   function @xmath41 is saturated at some level of the order of @xmath42 . for concreteness we can take @xmath46   @xmath41 is again proportional to @xmath3 for elevations much larger than @xmath42 : @xmath47 but with the proportionality constant @xmath48 .",
    "if so , we can also study the case @xmath49 even though such a condition may not be realizable in nature . in that case",
    "our analysis of the limit @xmath49 has only a methodological character : it allows to derive an approximate analytic solution for all the objects of interest as functions of @xmath40 that is also valid for the outer scale of turbulence not exceeding a value of the order of @xmath42 .",
    "it should be noticed that traditional turbulent closures ( including ours ) can not be applied for strongly stratified flows with @xmath50 ( may be even at @xmath51 ) .",
    "the main reason is that these closures are roughly justified for developed _",
    "vortical _ turbulence , in which the eddy - turnover time is of the order of its life time ; in other words , there are no well defined  quasi - particles \" or waves .",
    "this is not the case for stable stratification with @xmath50 , in which the brunt - visl frequency @xmath52 is larger then the eddy - turnover frequency @xmath53 .",
    "it means that for @xmath54 there are weakly decaying kelvin - helmoholtz internal gravity waves ( with characteristic frequency @xmath55 and decay time above @xmath56 ) , propagating on large distances , essentially effecting on tbl , as pointed out by zilitinkevich , ( 2002 ) .",
    "we concentrate in our paper on self - consistent description of the lower part of the atmospheric tbl , in which turbulence has vortical character and consequently , large values of @xmath13 do not appear .",
    "we relate large values of @xmath13 in the upper part of tbl with contributions of the internal gravity waves to the energy and the energy flux in tbl , to the momentum flux , and to the production of ( vortical ) turbulent energy . due to their instability in a shear flow , the waves can break and create turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "all these effects are beyond the framework of our paper .",

    "the aim of this section is to consider the simplified dynamics of a stably temperature - stratified turbulent boundary layer , aiming finally at an explicit description of the height dependence of important quantities like the mean velocity , mean temperature , turbulent kinetic and potential energies , etc . in general",
    "one expects very different profiles from those known in standard ( unstratified ) wall - bounded turbulence .",
    "we want to focus on these differences and propose that they occur already relatively close to the ground allowing us to neglect ( to the leading order ) the dependence of the density on height and the coriolis force .",
    "we thus begin by simplifying the hydrodynamic equations which are used in this section .",
    "first we briefly overview the derivation of the governing equations in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "the system of hydrodynamic equations describing a fluid in which the temperature is not uniform consists of the navier - stokes equations for the fluid velocity , @xmath63 , a continuity equation for the space and time dependent ( total ) density of the fluid , @xmath64 , and of the heat balance equation for the ( total ) entropy per unit mass , @xmath65 ,  landau and lifshitz , 1987 .",
    "these equations are considered with boundary conditions that maintain the solution far from the equilibrium state , where @xmath66 .",
    "these boundary conditions are @xmath67 at zero elevation , @xmath68 at a high elevation of a few kilometers .",
    "this reflects the existence of a wind at high elevation , but we do not attempt to model the physical origin of this wind in any detail .",
    "the only important condition with regards to this wind is that it maintains a momentum flux towards the ground that is prescribed as a function of the elevation .",
    "similarly , we assume that a stable temperature stratification is maintained such that the heat flux towards the ground is prescribed as well .",
    "we neglect the viscous entropy production term assuming that the temperature gradients are large enough such that the thermal entropy production term dominates . for simplicity of the presentation",
    "we restrict ourselves by relatively small elevations and disregard the coriolis force ( for more details , see wyngaard , 1992 ) . on the other hand",
    "we assume that the temperature and density gradients in the entire turbulent boundary layer are sufficiently small to allow employment of local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "in other words , we assume the validity of the equation of state .    as a",
    " basic reference state \" ( brs ) denoted hereafter by a subscript  @xmath69 \" we use the isentropic model of the atmosphere , where the entropy is considered space homogeneous . now assuming smallness of deviations of the density and pressure from their brs values and exploiting the equation of state , one obtains a simplified equation , which is already very close to the standard navier - stokes equation in the boussinesq approximation . introducing ( generalized ) potential temperature , one results in the well - known system of hydrodynamic equations in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "close to the ground , where one can neglect the dependence of the density on height , the system reads : @xmath70here @xmath71 is the convection time derivative , @xmath72  deviation of pressure from brs , @xmath73 is the density in brs , @xmath74 is the buoyancy parameter ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath10 is the gravity acceleration and @xmath77 is the thermal expansion coefficient , which is equal to @xmath78 , reciprocal molecular temperature , for an ideal gas ) , @xmath79 is the deviation of the potential temperature from brs value , @xmath80  kinematic viscosity and @xmath81 is the kinematic thermal conductivity .    to develop equations for the mean quantities and correlation functions",
