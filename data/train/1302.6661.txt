    "in a recent paper , @xcite we showed that the traditional concept of the uniform electron gas ( ueg ) , _ i.e. _  a homogeneous system of finite density , consisting of an infinite number of electrons in an infinite volume , @xcite is inadequate to model the uegs that arise in finite systems .",
    "accordingly , we proposed to embark on a comprehensive study of quasi - exact properties of finite - size uegs , in order eventually to create improved approximations in density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite    in an earlier paper , @xcite we introduced an alternative paradigm , in which @xmath0 electrons are confined to a @xmath11-sphere ( with @xmath12 ) , that is , the surface of a ( @xmath13)-dimensional ball .",
    "these systems possess uniform densities , even for finite @xmath0 and , because all points on a @xmath11-sphere are equivalent , their mathematical analysis is relatively straightforward .",
    "@xcite in the present paper , we study the one - dimensional ( @xmath14 ) version of model , in which @xmath0 electrons are confined to a ring of radius @xmath15 .",
    "the electron density of this @xmath0-electron ueg , which we will call @xmath0-ringium , is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the seitz radius .    in most previous work on the one - dimensional ( 1d ) ueg",
    ", the true coulomb potential @xmath18 has been avoided because of the intractability of its fourier transform . instead , most workers have softened the potential , either by adding a transverse harmonic component @xcite or by using a potential of the form @xmath19 . in the latter case ,",
    "the @xmath20 parameter eliminates the singularity at @xmath21 while retaining the long - range coulomb tail . @xcite    however , the introduction of a parameter @xmath22 is undesirable , for it modifies the physics of the system in the high - density regime where neighboring electrons repel far too weakly .",
    "it is also unnecessary , because the true coulomb potential is so repulsive that it causes the wave function to vanish when any two electrons touch , thereby removing the possibility of an energy divergence .",
    "@xcite    this nodal behavior leads to the 1d bose - fermi mapping @xcite which states that the ground state wave function of the bosonic ( b ) and fermionic ( f ) states are related by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the one - particle coordinates . in case of bosons , the divergence of the coulomb potential has the effect of mimicking the pauli principle which prohibits two fermions from touching .",
    "this implies that , for 1d systems , the bosonic and fermionic ground states are degenerate and the system is `` spin - blind '' . consequently , the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states are degenerate and we will consider only the latter .",
    "@xcite    the electrons - on - a - ring paradigm has been intensively studied as a model for quantum rings ( qrs ) , which are tiny , self - organised , ring - shaped semiconductors @xcite characterised by three parameters : radius ( @xmath15 ) , width ( @xmath25 ) and electron number ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "modern microfabrication technology has yielded ingaas and gaalas / gaas qrs that bind only a few electrons , @xcite in contrast with the mesoscopic rings on gaas which hold much larger numbers of electrons .",
    "@xcite these low - dimensional systems are the subject of considerable scientific interest and have been intensively studied , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically , @xcite mainly because of the observation of aharonov - bohm oscillations .",
    "@xcite    as a first approximation , qrs can be modelled by electrons confined to a perfect ring ( _ i.e. _  @xmath26 ) .",
    "in a recent paper , @xcite we considered a pair of electrons ( _ i.e. _  @xmath27 ) on such a ring and discovered that their schrdinger equation can be solved exactly , provided that the radius takes one of an infinite number of special values . some of the solutions exhibit the berry phase phenomenon , _",
    "i.e. _  if one of the electrons moves once around the ring and returns to its starting point , the wave function of the system changes sign .",
    "qrs are among the simplest systems with this peculiar property .    in section [ sec : pert ]",
    ", we first use rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory to investigate the energy in the high - density regime @xcite and then strong - coupling perturbation theory to study the low - density regime , where the electrons form a wigner crystal .",
    "@xcite in section [ sec : ec ] , we use explicitly correlated ( ec ) methods to determine the energy of @xmath0-ringium for @xmath28 .",
    "these methods are accurate for very small @xmath0 but their cost grows very rapidly with @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ sec : qmc ] , we turn to quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches for studying @xmath0-ringium up to @xmath29 over a range of densities .",
    "these methods provide a different approach to the many - body problem : variational monte carlo ( vmc ) @xcite and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) @xcite methods can be used to treat systems in one and higher dimensions at a computational cost that grows relatively slowly with @xmath0 ( at least , when @xmath0 is not too large .",
    "@xcite )    we frame our discussion in terms of _ reduced _ energy @xmath30 , _ i.e. _  energy per electron , so that we can pass smoothly from finite to infinite @xmath0 .",
    "one of the key goals of the paper is to develop an understanding of the correlation energy , which is defined as the difference @xmath31 between the exact and hartree - fock ( hf ) energies .",
    "atomic units are used throughout , but we report total energies in hartrees ( @xmath32 ) and correlation energies in millihartrees ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angle of electron @xmath36 around the ring center , and @xmath37 is the across - the - ring distance between electrons @xmath36 and @xmath38 .    in the high - density ( _ i.e. _  small @xmath2 ) regime , the kinetic energy is dominant and it is natural to define a zeroth - order hamiltonian @xmath39 and a perturbation @xmath40 the non - interacting orbitals and orbital energies are @xmath41 where @xmath42 a slater determinant @xmath43 of any @xmath0 of these orbitals has an energy @xmath44 and is an antisymmetric eigenfunction of @xmath45 . in the lowest energy ( aufbau )",
    "determinant @xmath46 , we occupy the orbitals with @xmath47 following the approach of mitas , @xcite one discovers the remarkable result @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a signed interelectronic distance .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath46 has a node whenever @xmath50 and , therefore , possesses the same nodes as the exact wave function .",
    "this will have important ramifications in section [ sec : qmc ] .",
    "rayleigh - schrdinger theory yields the perturbation expansion for the reduced energy @xmath51 where the high - density coefficients @xmath52 are found by setting @xmath53 and evaluating    @xmath54      to evaluate the coefficients @xmath52 with @xmath55 , one requires the `` double - bar '' integrals @xmath56 }                                                              { r_{12 } } d\\theta_1 d\\theta_2.\\ ] ] by elementary integration , one can show that @xmath57 where @xmath58,\\ ] ] and @xmath59 is the digamma function .",

    "we have performed exact - node dmc calculations to find the exact ground - state energies , with statistical errors in the @xmath64 range .",
