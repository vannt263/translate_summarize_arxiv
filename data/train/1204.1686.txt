    "points , @xmath0 lines , and @xmath1 directed segments in the real euclidean plane , to which eves theorem applies . ]    the example shown in figure [ fig1 ] , where eleven points lie on five lines , forming twelve directed segments , gives the general idea of eves theorem .",
    "the ratio of euclidean signed distances @xmath2 is called ( by eves ) an `` h - expression , '' meaning that each point @xmath3 occurs equally many times in the numerator and denominator ( for example , @xmath4 occurs twice ) , and each line defined by the two lists of six segments also occurs equally many times ( for example , @xmath5 occurs twice in the numerator and twice in the denominator ) .",
    "the statement of eves theorem is that the value of an h - expression is an invariant under projective transformations of the plane .",
    "related identities for products of distances have been known in projective geometry since at least @xcite , but it is convenient to attribute the above formulation to eves .    the notion of h - expression can also be more visually conveyed in terms of the configuration  an idea demonstrated at a 2011 talk by marc frantz @xcite .",
    "each point in the configuration of figure [ fig1 ] is an endpoint of an equal number of red and black segments , and , dually , each line contains an equal number of red and black segments .",
    "then the ratio of the product of red lengths to the product of black lengths is eves invariant .",
    "eves theorem , when stated in a purely projective way ( using homogeneous coordinates , not euclidean distances , as in example [ ex4.5 ] ) is itself a special case of a family of invariant ratios of products of determinants of homogeneous coordinates for points in projective space over a field @xmath6 .",
    "these ratios were well - known in @xmath7 century invariant theory ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but have been more recently used ( and , sometimes , re - discovered ) in projective geometry applied to computational topics such as vision and photogrammetry , or automated proofs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    eves theorem can be stated in terms of a function , where the input is a configuration of points @xmath8 in projective space @xmath9 , and the output is a ratio , i.e. , an element of the projective line @xmath10 ; the content of the theorem is that the ratio is well - defined ( independent of certain choices made in specifying the configuration ) and also invariant under projective transformations .",
    "our new construction , theorem [ thm4.4 ] , generalizes the target to a `` weighted projective space '' @xmath11 , so the projective line is the special case @xmath12 . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we give a unified treatment of the configurations to which theorem [ thm4.4 ] applies , by a weighting , coloring , and indexing scheme .",
    "a configuration @xmath8 of points in the projective space @xmath9 that satisfies a condition ( definition [ def4.2 ] ) , depending on the weight vector @xmath13 , is assigned an element @xmath14 , an invariant under `` morphisms '' of the configuration ( definition [ def4.7 ] ) , which generalize projective transformations .",
    "the number of colors is @xmath15 , so the classical case is the assignment of eves ratio @xmath16 to some two - color configurations @xmath8 , and the new weighted invariants apply to a larger category of multi - color configurations .    in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we review the definition and some elementary properties of weighted projective spaces  these properties are well - known in the complex case , but the real case is different in some ways we intend to exploit , so we are careful to present all the necessary details .",
    "section [ sec2 ] introduces a new notion of `` reconstructibility '' for a weighted projective space ; the two main results are that complex weighted projective spaces are all reconstructible , and that some real weighted projective spaces are not . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we review a connection between real projective and euclidean geometry , and state a euclidean version of theorem [ thm4.4 ] .",
    "section [ sec5 ] applies the notion of reconstructibility to show that in the complex case , the weighted invariant @xmath17 of a multi - color configuration can be determined by finding the ( classical ) @xmath18 ratios for a finite list of related two - color configurations .",
    "however , in the real case , examples [ ex6.1 ] , [ ex6.4 ] , [ ex6.5 ] give pairs of configurations with different weighted invariants in @xmath19 , but which can not be distinguished by applying the reconstruction method to the @xmath18 ratios in @xmath20 .",
    "this section reviews the definition of weighted projective spaces and some of their elementary properties . for the complex case , these properties ( in particular , examples [ ex1.4b ] and [ ex1.14 ] ) , are well - known ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; we give elementary proofs with the intent of showing how the complex and real cases are different .",
