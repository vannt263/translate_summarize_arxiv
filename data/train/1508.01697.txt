    "quantization of vorticity is a remarkable manifestation of superfluid properties of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "different kinds of vortex structures have been theoretically predicted and observed experimentally in atomic becs ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) : single vortex lines , vortex - antivortex pairs , vortex arrays , vortex rings , vortex knots , dimerons @xcite , three - dimensional vortex solitons @xcite , and solitary waves moving along a straight vortex line @xcite ( which are similar to `` hoop '' structures known in field theory @xcite ) .",
    "it is of special interest to construct stable vortex - soliton states with complex structure , such as vortex knots @xcite , three - dimensional skyrmions , @xcite and hopfions .",
    "a hopfion ( or hopf soliton ) is a topological soliton with two independent winding numbers : the first , @xmath0 , characterizes a horizontal circular vortex embedded into a three - dimensional soliton ; and the second , @xmath1 , corresponds to vorticity around the axis , perpendicular to this circle .",
    "hopf solitons appear in many fields , including field theory , optics , ferromagnets , and semi- and superconductors .",
    "hopfions have been predicted theoretically both in systems with multicomponent wave functions @xcite and in single - component bec @xcite .",
    "multicharged ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) vortex structures have been demonstrated  @xcite to be unstable in optical media .",
    "stationary hopfion solutions with @xmath4 , @xmath5 of the single - component gross - pitaevskii - equation ( gpe ) have been obtained numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite for a spherically - symmetric trapping potential . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", neither a dynamical nor an energetic stability analysis has been performed previously for hopfions in trapped becs .",
    "very recently @xcite hopfions have been demonstrated to be stable in a single - component bec without linear trapping potential but with a repulsive non - linearity , which grows fast enough from the center to the periphery of the trap .    in our recent work",
    "@xcite we suggested an experimentally feasible trapping configuration that can be used to create , stabilize , and manipulate a vortex ring in a controllable and nondestructive manner . in this paper",
    "we use a similar trapping potential and a rotating condensate which allows the formation of a stable hopfion .",
    "we demonstrate both energetic and dynamical stability of the hopf soliton for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "the properties of an atomic bec close to thermodynamic equilibrium can be accurately described in mean - field approximation by a dissipative gross - pitaevskii equation ( dgpe ) , which takes the following form in a rotating frame @xcite , @xmath6\\psi(\\textbf{r},t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 is a phenomenological dissipation parameter , @xmath8 the rotation rate , @xmath9 is the laplace operator , @xmath10 is the angular momentum in @xmath11-direction , @xmath12 is the coupling strength , @xmath13 is the chemical potential of the condensate , @xmath14 is the mass of the atom , and @xmath15 is the @xmath16-wave scattering length .",

    "the external trapping potential @xmath21 is created by an oblate harmonic trap @xmath22 and two blue - detuned laser beams : a radial laguerre - gaussian beam lg@xmath23 and an elliptic highly anisotropic `` sheet '' beam creating a tight repulsive potential in @xmath11-dimension : @xmath24 } + v_z e^{-(z / z_{\\rm t})^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the effective width of the sheet - beam , @xmath27 is the radial coordinate of the trap minimum , and @xmath28 is the topological charge of the red - detuned lg@xmath23 optical beam .",
    "let us consider a bec cloud with @xmath29 of @xmath30rb atoms ( @xmath31 nm ) in an oblate harmonic trap with @xmath32 hz , @xmath33 hz , and a characteristic oscillatory length @xmath34 m .",
    "the tube beam has parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 m , and @xmath37khz , the sheet beam has parameters @xmath38 m , and @xmath39khz , where @xmath40 is the planck s constant .",
    "this trap geometry is similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite modified slightly to increase the stability of the vortex line by squeezing the trap in the @xmath11 direction and shifting the toroidal void position farther from the center .",
    "such a trap configuration is supposed to naturally accommodate the complex core structure of a hopfion ( see fig .",
    "[ torus ] ) .        in what follows we use dimensionless units for",
    "the spatial coordinates @xmath41 , for time @xmath42 , and for other quantities @xmath43 ,",

    "the phenomenological dissipation parameter @xmath55 was chosen to be constant , though general results do not qualitatively depend on this value .",
    "if we aim to study the dependence of the total energy ( [ e3d ] ) on the rotation rate @xmath8 then it is convenient to split it into two parts @xmath56 the first part @xmath57 is the energy in the absence of rotation @xmath58d\\mathbf{r},\\ ] ] and the second part @xmath59 depends on the average of the angular momentum @xmath60    we obtain the bec ground - state @xmath61 by imaginary time propagation @xcite from eq .",

    "( [ e3d ] ) .",
    "then , in order to model a hopfion state characterized by topological charges @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we imprint on the ground state an @xmath0-charged vortex ring with coordinates @xmath64 and an @xmath1-charged vortex line shifted by @xmath65 off the center .",
    "@xmath66 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath25 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the width of the vortex core is estimated by the healing length @xmath71 at the peak density of the condensate .",
    "if the vortex line is straight and parallel to the @xmath11-axis and the vortex ring is parallel to the @xmath72-plane , the superflows of the vortex ring and line are moving in perpendicular directions .",
    "additionally , the density perturbations caused by the vortex cores are tightly localized and do not overlap in the regions of interest .",
    "therefore , the contributions to the total energy from the vortex ring and vortex line are independent and can be analysed separately , @xmath73 and we take into account that the vortex ring in the @xmath74plane does not contribute to the angular momentum in @xmath11-direction",
    ".    the energy analysis of the vortex ring is performed by putting @xmath5 and @xmath75 in ( [ psiimprint ] ) .",
    "then the energy @xmath76 depends only on @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( see fig .  [ energy_ring ] ) .",
    "the vortex ring nucleation energy shows a minimum localized close to the density minimum at the crossing of the `` tube '' and `` sheet '' beams .",
    "it is worth noticing that the existence of an energy minimum does not necessarily correlate with the existence of a density minimum in the ground state .",
    "figure  [ energy_ring2 ] shows that for certain intensities of the `` tube '' beam an off - center minimum exists in the vortex ring nucleation energy but not in the ground - state density .",
    "( @xmath79  blue solid line , @xmath80  red dashed line , @xmath81  green dotted line ) . ]    the energy associated with the vortex line is obtained by putting @xmath82 and @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ psiimprint ] ) .",
    "this energy @xmath83 depends only on @xmath8 and @xmath65 . in analogy to the analysis of fetter @xcite we can define two characteristic rotation speeds .",
    "the first , @xmath84 , is chosen such that @xmath85 at @xmath86 .",
    "it means that for @xmath87 a state with the vortex at the origin is energetically preferable over a state without vortex .",
    "this rotation rate can be defined as @xmath88 note that @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain this critical velocity only @xmath90 has to be calculated .",
    "the second characteristic rotation rate @xmath91 corresponds to a vanishing curvature of @xmath92 at @xmath86 : @xmath93 this rotation rate defines the region @xmath94 where the energy shows a minimum at @xmath86 and the vortex line at the origin can be stable ( or metastable ) . due to our specific trap configuration",
    "there might be another energy minimum for the vortex line which is close to the peak intensity of the `` tube '' beam .",
    "but this minimum is not relevant for the stability of a hopfion as it correlates with a stable position of the vortex ring . as the line and the ring",
    "have to be spatially separated , we demand the existence of a minimum at the origin as a situation favourable for a stable hopfion .    as is seen from fig .",
    "[ energy_line ] , in the suggested trap configuration , a vortex state can be energetically preferable without being stable at the center of the trap .",
    "this means that if we need to stabilize the vortex core at the axis , the rotation rate has to be considerably higher than @xmath84 .",
    "therefore @xmath95 , which is opposite to the case of a spherical condensate studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    "we consider the obtained value @xmath96 as a minimal rotation rate at which the vortex line can be stable at the center of the trap and , therefore , at which we can also expect the overall stability of the hopfion complex .",
    "for the solution of the time - dependent gpe we use a split - step fourier transform method @xcite .",
    "the initial state for the simulations takes the same form eq .",
    "( [ psiimprint ] ) as in the energetic stability analysis of the previous section , i.e. a stationary state with imprinted vortex ring and line ( @xmath5 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "their initial positions are considerably displaced from their equilibrium ( by up to @xmath97 ) .",
    "we study the dynamical stability of this hopfion solution for a wide range of rotation rates @xmath8 .",
    "we observe two different instability scenarios of the hopfion dynamics .",
    "if the rotation rate is low or the initial position of the vortex line is too far away from equilibrium , the system is unstable with respect to reconnection of the line and ring cores . as a consequence ,",
    "several line vortices are created which , in turn , can be stable and form a lattice at the off - center energy minimum ( see fig .  [ unstable1_dynamics ] ) .    .",
    "in the initial state @xmath5 , @xmath4 .",
    "reconnection happens at @xmath98 s. the four vortex lines in the final state are stable . ]    the second instability scenario is observed at high rotation rates and is independent of the initial displacement of the vortices .",
    "due to a low energy barrier ( see fig .  [ energy_line ] ) , additional vortices can be nucleated at the outer edge of the bec cloud and then penetrate into the condensate destroying the ring vortex and again forming a regular vortex chain at the off - center energy minimum ( see fig .  [ unstable2_dynamics ] ) .    .",
    "in the initial state @xmath5 , @xmath4 . the hopfion complex itself is stable , but starting from @xmath99 s vortices from the outside start to penetrate the cloud eventually destroying the vortex ring . ]",
    "it is however possible to choose a rotation rate that is high enough for stabilization of the vortex line at the center but at the same time low enough that additional vortices are not generated at the outer edge of the condensate",
    ". then the vortex hopfion may be dynamically stable for experimentally traceable time intervals which are comparable to the life - time of the condensate ( see fig .  [ stable_dynamics ] ) . for a strong initial displacement of the vortex line of @xmath97 we found a region of stability between @xmath100 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the vortex line relaxes to a position slightly off the center of the trap even though the energy minimum is located there .",
    "however , the energetic stability analysis does not take into account bending of the vortex cores , which are energetically preferred over straight vortices .",
    "this may also explain the fact that the vortex line is dynamically stabilized at a rotation rate lower than predicted by the energetic analysis .    .",
    "in the initial state @xmath5 , @xmath4 .",
    "shapes of the vortex cores persist through all the time of simulation . ]",
    "it is also instructive to analyze the dynamics of hopfions with a topological charge of the vortex line @xmath101 . as multiply charged vortices in bec are essentially unstable , the vortex line splits into a tangled complex of several singly charged vortices ( see fig .",
    "[ m2_dynamics ] ) .",
    "because these vortices repel each other they can not all be simultaneously stabilized at the center of the trap .",
    "they rather relax to the energy minimum at the peak intensity of the `` tube '' beam .",
    "this inevitably leads to reconnection with the vortex ring and the observed dynamical scenario is similar to the instability scenario of singly charged vortex lines at low rotation rates ( compare figs .",

    "similarly , the hopfion with a multicharged vortex ring ( @xmath3 ) can not be stabilized in a suggested trap geometry ( see fig .  [ s2_dynamics ] ) .",
    "the multi - charged vortex ring splits into two leapfrogging singly - charged rings , that spiral around the energy minimum drifting away from it until they are destroyed by growing kelvin waves .",
    "it is remarkable that in sharp contrast to studies of multicharged ( @xmath3 ) hopfions in optical media @xcite we do not observe the formation of vortex knots in our simulations of the dissipative dynamics of hopf solitons in bec .",
    ", @xmath4 ) for the rotation rate @xmath103 . ]",
    "the destruction of the hopfion in the proposed setup always leads to formation of a vortex chain along the off - center energy minimum .",
    "the number of vortices in this chain is defined not only by the rotation rate but also by the total energy released by destruction of the hopfion complex ( note a six - vortex final state in fig .",
    "[ s2_dynamics ] ) .",
    "the main aim of the present work is a demonstration that hopfions can be stabilized in experimentally feasible one - component trapped becs .",
    "suitable parameters sets for the stabilization of hopfions depend on the specific experimental realization of bec .",
    "we observed that hopfions are more stable in highly oblate traps since vortex line bending and tilting are suppressed under these conditions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , imprinting the vortex line closer to the axis extends the stability region towards lower rotation rates .",
    "we show that hopf solitons can be energetically and dynamically stable in a rotating trapped atomic bec . in the framework of a dissipative mean - field model we investigate different dynamical regimes of hopfion stability .",
    "it turns out that within a certain interval of bec rotation velocities a hopfion may be stable . for rotation rates lower than this interval",
    "the vortex line and ring deform and finally reconnect . for over - critical angular velocities , vortex lines are nucleated at the outer edge of the condensate and then reconnect with the vortex ring .",
    "multiply charged vortex lines split into singly charged vortex lines , which then reconnect with the ring component .",
    "decay of the hopfion leads to the formation of a vortex lattice .",
    "the kinetic energy of the ring component is transferred via reconnection to the vortex lattice . as is well known",
