    "estimation of parameters of statistical or econometric models is one of the main concerns in the parametric inference framework . when the probability law is specified ( up to unknown parameters ) , the main tool to solve this problem is the maximum likelihood ( ml ) technique ; on the other hand , whenever the assumption of a particular distribution is too restrictive , different solutions may be considered .",
    "for instance the method of moments ( mm ) and the generalized method of moments ( gmm ) provide valuable alternative procedures ; in fact the application of these methods only requires the knowledge of some moments .",
    "a different approach is to consider the method of quantiles ( mq ) , that is the analogue of mm with quantiles ; mq estimators are obtained by matching the empirical percentiles with their theoretical counterparts at one or more probability levels .",
    "inference via quantiles goes back to @xcite where the authors consider an estimation problem for a three - parameter log - normal distribution ; their approach consists in minimizing a suitable distance between the theoretical and empirical quantiles , see for instance @xcite .",
    "successive papers deal with the estimation of parameters of extreme value ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , logistic ( see @xcite ) and weibull ( see @xcite ) distributions .",
    "a more recent reference is @xcite where several other distributions are studied .",
    "we also recall @xcite where the authors consider an indirect inference method based on the simulation of theoretical quantiles , or a function of them , when they are not available in a closed form . in @xcite , an iterative procedure based on ordinary least - squares estimation",
    "is proposed to compute mq estimators ; such estimators can be easily modified by adding a lasso penalty term if a sparse representation is desired , or by restricting the matching within a given range of quantiles to match a part of the target distribution .",
    "quantiles and empirical quantiles represent a key tool also in quantitative risk management , where they are studied under the name of value - at - risk ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in our opinion ,",
    "mq estimators deserve a deeper investigation because of several advantages .",
    "they allow to estimate parameters when the moments are not available and they are invariant with respect to increasing transformations ; moreover they have less computational problems , and behave better when distributions are heavy - tailed or their supports vary with the parameters .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present large deviation results for mq estimators ( as the sample size tends to infinity ) for statistical models with one - dimensional unknown parameter @xmath2 , where the parameter space @xmath3 is a subset of the real line ; thus we match empirical and theoretical quantiles at one probability level @xmath0 .",
    "the theory of large deviations is a collection of techniques which gives an asymptotic computation of small probabilities on an exponential scale ( see e.g. @xcite as a reference on this topic ) .",
    "several examples of statistical models are considered throughout the paper , and some particular distributions are studied in detail . for most of the examples",
    "considered , we are able to find an explicit expression for the rate function which governs the large deviation principle of the mq estimators and , when possible , our investigation provides the optimal @xmath1 that guarantees a faster convergence to the true parameter ( see definition [ def : optimal - lambda ] ) .",
    "further we compare mq and mm estimators in terms of the local behavior of the rate functions around the true value of the parameter in the spirit of remark [ rem : comparison - between - rfs ] .",
    "which one of the estimators behaves better strictly depends on the type of parameter we have to estimate and varies upon distributions .",
    "however , we provide explicit examples ( a part from the obvious ones where the mm estimators are not available ) where mq estimators are preferable .",
    "we conclude with the outline of the paper . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we recall some preliminaries .",
    "sections [ sec : results - for - mqestimators ] and [ sec : results - for - mmestimators ] are devoted to the results for mq and mm estimators , respectively . in section [ sec : examples ] we present examples for different kind of parameters ( e.g. scale , location , skewness , etc . ) , and for each example specific distributions are discussed in section [ sec : local - comparison - for - examples ] .",
    "in this section we present some preliminaries on large deviations and we provide a rigorous definition of the mq estimators studied in this paper ( see definition [ def : mq - estimators ] below ) .",
    "we start with the concept of large deviation principle ( ldp for short ) .",
    "a sequence of random variables @xmath4 taking values on a topological space @xmath5 satisfies the ldp with rate function @xmath6 $ ] if @xmath7 is a lower semi - continuous function , @xmath8 and @xmath9 we also recall that a rate function @xmath7 is said to be good if all its level sets are compact .",
