    "let @xmath0 be a fixed rational elliptic curve , and consider the sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 of quadratic twists of @xmath3 that contain respectively the even and odd twists @xmath4 with @xmath5 a fundamental discriminant . for even twists , the birch  swinnerton - dyer conjecture @xcite states that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the real period , @xmath8 is the global tamagawa number , @xmath9 is the shafarevich - tate group , and @xmath10 is the order of the torsion subgroup , all of these quantities being with respect to the quadratic twist  @xmath11 .",
    "random matrix theory applied with orthogonal symmetry @xcite predicts that @xmath12 \\approx x^{1/2}(\\log x)^{3/8 } \\quad\\text{as}\\>\\ > x\\rightarrow 0 , \\label{eqn : prob0}\\ ] ] where we use the @xmath13 notation to indicate that the quotient of the two sides tends to an unspecified constant that depends on  @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath14 is a square while @xmath8 and @xmath10 are well - understood integers , we get a discretisation from  we expect that @xmath15 if , say , we have that  @xmath16 . because @xmath7 essentially acts like @xmath17 , this gives a rough prediction that @xmath18 \\approx ( \\log |d|)^{c}/|d|^{1/4}\\ ] ] as  @xmath19 , where the constant @xmath20 is well - understood , largely dependent on the rational @xmath21-torsion structure of  @xmath3 .",
    "finally , these heuristics lead to a conjecture about the number of positive rank twists in @xmath1 , namely that there should be about @xmath22 of them as  @xmath23 .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for odd twists ; here we have that @xmath15 from the functional equation , and now the bsd conjecture takes into account the regulator  @xmath24 : @xmath25 this regulator is rather mysterious , and , as in the case of regulators and class numbers for real quadratic fields , does not seem totally disjoint from the shafarevich - tate group .",
    "the heuristic of delaunay @xcite gives some idea of how we might expect @xmath26 to be distributed , but for the regulator we have only the lower bound of size @xmath27 of silverman @xcite and a conjectured upper bound of @xmath28 of lang  @xcite .",
    "also , the analogue of has a different exponent ; we have @xmath29 \\approx x^{3/2}(\\log x)^{3/8 } \\quad\\text{as}\\>\\ > x\\rightarrow 0 .",
    "\\label{eqn : prob}\\ ] ] in analogy with the class number problem we might be so bold as to guess that @xmath30 is always large if nonzero , say as big as @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath7 acts like  @xmath17 , this then implies that  @xmath32 .",
    "more generally , we might guess that @xmath33 at least in a statistical sense , that is , there are disproportionately few twists with nonzero @xmath34-values smaller than this .    from this , in analogy with the above argument ( and ignoring logarithmic factors )",
    "we obtain that as @xmath19 we have @xmath35 \\approx 1/|d|^{3\\theta/2},\\ ] ] so that the number of twists of rank greater than 1 should be about @xmath36 as @xmath23 .",
    "we now proceed to give models and data which suggest various values for  @xmath37 .",
    "note that the only provable ( assuming  bsd ) bound is that  @xmath38 , which would lead to a prediction of only @xmath39 odd twists of rank greater than 1 .",
    "however , for an infinite family of curves @xmath3 and under the assumption of the parity conjecture , rubin and silverberg @xcite can prove that there are @xmath40 twists of rank at least  3 .",
    "the above conjecture   implies that @xmath24 and @xmath9 are linked in a mysterious way ; if we have a generator of small height ( so that  @xmath24 is small ) , then this tends to make @xmath9 be larger than general . the constructions of rubin and silverberg by their very nature yield points that are of height that is polynomial in @xmath41",
    " indeed , almost any parametrised family will have this feature , as writing down points of larger height is not feasible .",
    "these facts together suggest that by taking families with small generators we can generate large values of  @xmath42 .",
    "however , this does not work quite so simply in practise  we do get large values of  @xmath42 , but not always ( as we will see in section  [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we might suggest a statistical version of   rather than a universal lower bound .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 has rank zero and @xmath43 is a fundamental discriminant that is a square modulo  @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the conductor of @xmath3 , and also assume for simplicity that @xmath46 . by work of gross and zagier  @xcite , we have a construction for a point @xmath47 on @xmath11 that gives a torsion point precisely when the rank of @xmath11 is greater than 1 ; indeed , the height  @xmath48 of the constructed point is proportional to @xmath49 : @xmath50 where here @xmath51 is the area of the fundamental parallelogram associated to a minimal model for  @xmath3 .",
    "when the rank of @xmath11 is 1 , the point @xmath47 has infinite order but is not in general a generator of the free part of the group of rational points ; the index of @xmath47 depends on @xmath14 , but cancels out in the end .",
    "the construction of the point @xmath47 goes via class - field theory ; we get a point @xmath52 over the hilbert class field via a complex multiplication result largely due to shimura , and then sum the conjugates to get a point first in the imaginary quadratic field @xmath53 and then in @xmath54 itself .",
    "the number of conjugates of @xmath52 in the hilbert class field is essentially the class number @xmath55 of @xmath53 .",
    "these points , all being conjugate , have the same height . to get the height of the resulting point in @xmath54 , we model the situation by assuming that we are summing @xmath55 unit vectors in space ; this leads to the prediction that the height is almost surely close to @xmath55 which is of size @xmath56 .",
    "if we assume that the height of @xmath52 is not too small we then get a prediction that @xmath57 , leading to about @xmath58 twists in @xmath2 which have rank  3 or greater .",
    "however , it is not clear why the height of  @xmath52 might not be of size @xmath59  itself , as its coordinates are in a field whose degree is of size  @xmath56 .    we can try to test the validity of this model by taking @xmath60 with @xmath49 small and then computing the height of the point  @xmath52 in the hilbert class field",
    "however , when the class field has large degree ( that is , when the class number is large ) , it will be difficult to recognise the coordinates of  @xmath52 , so we can not take @xmath61 too large here .",
    "we were thus unable to generate enough examples to perform any real test of the model .",
    "a less profound idea is to assert that the connection between rank 1 and rank 3 twists should be the same as the connection between rank  0 and rank 2 twists , at least to first approximation .",
    "heuristics and random matrix theory @xcite give @xmath62 rank 2 curves amongst even quadratic twists up to @xmath63 . if we thus guess that there about @xmath64 twists of rank 3 up to  @xmath63 , via reverse - engineering the argument of two sections previous , this could then be used to determine a value of @xmath65 .",
    "we note that there are two random matrix models that have been proposed for modeling the zeros of @xmath66-functions associated with elliptic curves .",
    "the prediction of snaith @xcite is extended to higher ranks by looking at a zero - dimensional subset of @xmath67 ( for even twists ) or @xmath68 ( for odd twists ) with @xmath69 eigenvalues conditioned to lie at  1 .",
    "this model predicts @xmath70 \\approx x^{r+1/2}(\\log x)^{-r^2/2+r/2 + 3/8}$ ] .",
    "in contrast , miller @xcite has proposed his independent model , with eigenvalue distribution decomposing as a sum of @xmath71 point - masses and the eigenvalue distribution of the symmetry group @xmath67 or  @xmath68 . in this case the @xmath69th derivative analogue of and is given by for @xmath67 symmetry and for @xmath68 symmetry .",
    "there is both theoretical evidence @xcite and numerical data  @xcite that the 1- and 2-level densities of zeros follow miller s independent model for @xmath66-functions associated with parameterised families of elliptic curves with @xmath69 constructed points that generate the infinite part of the mordell - weil group .",
    "but there is no evidence to suggest that the miller model should hold in the case of quadratic twists , and in fact the exponent  3/2 in   is supported by the shape of the value distribution of  @xmath49 ( see figure  [ fig : graph ] ) as well as by the results in section  [ sec : qtwist ] .",
    "this illustrates that for odd twists the zero of @xmath72 at @xmath73 is apparently not independent  in contrast to a case of young s @xcite where the zero was the result of a constructed rational point on the elliptic curve .    finally there is a model due to a.  granville .",
    "let @xmath3 be a fixed elliptic curve given by the model  @xmath74 .",
    "here we make a heuristic for the number of integral points @xmath75 with @xmath76 and  @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "there are about @xmath79 such @xmath80-pairs , and each leads to a right - hand side which is of size  @xmath81 .",
    "the number of integers that are of size @xmath81 and are @xmath60 times a square with @xmath77 is  @xmath82 , and thus the probability that an integer of size  @xmath81 is of this form is @xmath83 .",
    "multiplying this by our   possibilities for  @xmath80 , we get a total of   integral solutions , independent of  @xmath63 . summing this dyadically over  @xmath63 ,",
    "we get   total solutions up to  @xmath84 , and switching to logarithmic heights , we get that the number of points of height less than  @xmath85 on the @xmath86 twists of  @xmath3 is  @xmath87 .",
    "we then note ( under grh ) that @xmath11 has regulator at most size  @xmath28 ; if @xmath11 is of rank  3 , since a random @xmath88-dimensional lattice of this covolume should have a vector whose length is of size  @xmath89 , we then expect a point of height less than @xmath90 on  @xmath11 . from the above , we expect no more than about @xmath91 such twists up to  @xmath63 .",
    "the prediction of  @xmath87 such @xmath75-tuples can be proved via a sieve argument for small  @xmath85 , but is more dubious for large  @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , with just one twist of rank  @xmath69 with generator of maximal height  @xmath55 , we get @xmath92 points of height less than  @xmath85 ; with @xmath93 and @xmath94 we outdo the linear growth predicted by the model . however , we only need @xmath85 to be a small power of  @xmath86 , and it is unclear how far the heuristic can be pushed .",
    "note that the obvious generalisation of this heuristic predicts an upper bound of @xmath95 for the number of rank @xmath69  twists .",
    "we now give tables and graphs that concern the above heuristics and conjectures . in our first graph ( figure  [ fig : graph ] ) , we plot the @xmath34 values for odd twists of @xmath96 with  @xmath97 .",
    "we are most concerned with the behaviour as @xmath98 , so we zoom in on this point ; there are about 300000 total curves , of which 760 have  @xmath99 .",
    "looking at this graph , it looks as though there is an abrupt cutoff .",
    "we find that the smallest nonzero value of @xmath49 is about @xmath100 for  @xmath101 .",
    "however , it should be noted that it might be superior to look at the distribution of  @xmath102 , due to the fact that the average value of @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath41 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this changes the picture quantitatively ( see figure  [ fig : graph2 ] ) , as the gap size becomes comparable to that of the @xmath66-distribution at the top of the graph .",
    "we compare the situation between even and odd twists . for @xmath97",
    "there are about 30 times more even twists with @xmath15 than odd twists with  @xmath103 ; however this factor of  30 is dependent on our cutoff of  @xmath104 , and as we note below , it is not clear what happens asymptotically .",
    "if we restricted our range of  @xmath60 to a shorter interval , say @xmath105 , then the upper graph of @xmath66-values would be close to steplike , since the size of  @xmath60 is the only continuous variable in the bsd formula .",
    "however , the lower graph would still be rather smooth , since in the rank 1 case the regulator can not be modelled as a discrete variable .",
    "letting @xmath106 be the subset of @xmath2 with @xmath103 , if we believe that @xmath107 we can try to fit the data to get the exponent  @xmath108 . for @xmath96",
    "there are 760 odd twists with @xmath99 with @xmath97 .",
    "the best - fit exponent for the data is  @xmath109 , though if we just look at the last 380 curves , we get @xmath110 .",
    "the computations of elkies @xcite for @xmath111 go up to @xmath112 , and give @xmath113 overall and @xmath114 for the last half of the data ; of course , we are ignoring log - factors , so @xmath115 is quite reasonable .",
    "for @xmath116 we get @xmath117 and for @xmath118 we get @xmath119 .",
    "these might seem large , but elkies has @xmath120 at @xmath104 before it drops significantly as indicated above .",
    "also , since @xmath116 , @xmath118 , and @xmath111 all have nontrivial @xmath21-torsion while @xmath96 does not , we might expect the exponent of the logarithm to be larger for them , which could lead to a larger observed value of  @xmath108 across the range of our dataset . for comparison with the even twist case , the dataset of rubinstein @xcite for the number of rank 2 imaginary quadratic twists of @xmath96 has best - fit exponents of about @xmath121 up to @xmath122 , while we expect the exponent to be  @xmath123 .    to get a dataset of twists with points of small height",
    ", we looked at the @xmath60th twist of @xmath124 for  @xmath125 ; the curve @xmath126 will have the point  @xmath127 whose height is of size of  @xmath128 .",
    "as mentioned above , if holds , we would expect such curves to have large values of  @xmath14 .",
    "though we get some large examples like @xmath129 and @xmath130 for which  @xmath131 , this idea does not always work so well .",
    "for instance , with @xmath132 and @xmath133 we have  @xmath134 , where here we have  @xmath135 ; similarly @xmath136 and @xmath137 has  @xmath134 , though in this case @xmath138 is not quite so small .",
    "note also that the results of delaunay and duquesne @xcite for curves connected to the simplest cubic fields show @xmath139 to occur quite often .",
    "more extensive experiments using techniques similar to those of elkies are planned  indeed , it would be nice to have data for the odd twists comparable to that which @xcite has for even twists . up to this point ,",
    "our experiments for odd twists have simply computed the value of @xmath34 for every twist up to @xmath63 and so takes @xmath140 total time , while the method of elkies takes @xmath141 time , as does the computation of  @xcite .",
    "we can note that the computations of elkies @xcite already give indirect evidence that is probably correct . while elkies notes a strange discrepancy in the counts @xmath11 with rank  3 for @xmath60 modulo  16 , in fact , as explained in the last section of  @xcite",
    ", we expect such discrepancies for all ( prime ) moduli  @xmath142 whose frobenius trace @xmath143 is nonzero .",
    "in particular , of the @xmath60 with @xmath144 we expect that the number of nonzero quadratic residues mod  @xmath142 is not the same as the number of quadratic nonresidues .",
    "the derivation in @xcite gives a ratio of @xmath145 where the exponent @xmath146 is taken to be the rightmost pole of the distribution function ; in the rank 1 case , the corresponding calculation of @xcite implies that we should take  @xmath147 .",
    "this is a reasonably testable prediction , given that the dataset of elkies has 8740 curves . in table",
    "[ table : ratio ] we give the results for some primes that are 1  mod  4 ; since @xmath148 for other odd primes the ratio should be  1 , and indeed it is always quite close . here",
    "the @xmath149 and @xmath45 columns count the @xmath60 for which @xmath11 has rank 3 and @xmath60 is respectively a nonzero quadratic residue and a quadratic nonresidue mod  @xmath142 , while the @xmath3 column calculates their experimentally - determined ratio , and @xmath20 is the conjectured ratio from the above with  @xmath147 .       following a suggestion of a.  venkatesh , we can consider whether all the small @xmath34 values ( possibly including  @xmath99 ) essentially come from a small number of parametrised families .",
    "we can make a heuristical argument against the analogous claim that all rank 2 curves should come from parametrised families .",
    "a heuristic of watkins @xcite gives that there should be at least @xmath150 curves of analytic rank 2 with conductor less than  @xmath63 , whereas we expect there only to be about @xmath151 curves with two small generators .",
    "we can go to curves of larger rank and look at the distribution of @xmath152 and @xmath153 for curves of ( analytic ) rank 2 and 3 in the database .",
    "if we ignore various examples of small conductor , the smallest value of @xmath152 for a curve of larger conductor is about @xmath154 for the curve @xmath155 $ ] of conductor  6264757621 , where again we see the large cancellation between @xmath156 and  @xmath157 . for rank  3",
    "the smallest value of @xmath153 for curves of larger conductor is about @xmath158 for the curve @xmath159 $ ] whose conductor is  1531408357 .",
    "though there is large cancellation between @xmath156 and @xmath157  here , it is not as noticeable as in the cases above ; however , the large cancellation appears again for the next - best curve @xmath160 $ ] of conductor  6352778197 for which we have  @xmath161 . as noted above , it is better to divide the @xmath162-values through by the expected average value , which is propotional to  @xmath163 , before making these comparisons ; upon doing this , the listed curves of conductor  6264757621 and conductor  6352778197 have the smallest respective values .      via the use of random matrix theory ,",
    "we have given a link ( as in the case of rank 2 quadratic twists ) between the distribution of @xmath34-values and the number of rank 3 quadratic twists , but are unable to gain much insight into solving the discretisation problem .",
    "although we might expect a smooth distribution function for  @xmath49 ( especially as it is an analytic and not an arithmetic object ) , there is some evidence of a rather abrupt cutoff in the distribution .",
    "this has led some of the authors of this paper to conjecture in a universal form , while others remain more skeptical .",
    "we have also discussed various methods for modelling the number of rank  3 quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve .",
    "however , currently we do not have enough data to feel confident in eliminating any of the suggestions .",
