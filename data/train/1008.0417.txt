    "the @xmath491 elements @xmath1053 of @xmath4  have degrees @xmath1054 in @xmath840 following remark  [ rmk : living ] , we exhibit a free basis of @xmath1055 whose elements all map to the same generator of @xmath1056 fix @xmath1057 and write @xmath1058 with @xmath208 and @xmath209 being the distinguished hyperplanes , and let @xmath1059 be the corresponding canonical generators of @xmath740 each of the @xmath738 for @xmath1060 lie in @xmath959 hence map to zero in @xmath1056 using the identification of @xmath1061 with @xmath1062 it is clear that @xmath1063 and @xmath1064 map to @xmath1065 by reversing orientation we may assume they each map to 1 .",
    "then @xmath1066 is a free basis of @xmath1067 each element of which maps to 1 in @xmath1068 . repeating the process for each @xmath1069 yields the desired free basis of @xmath787 since @xmath1070 this proves the claim .",
