    "the limiting behavior of the spectrum of such matrices is of considerable interest for mathematical physics and information theory .",
    "in addition , such random matrices play an important role in operator algebra studies initiated by voiculescu , now known as free ( non  commutative ) probability theory ( see @xcite and @xcite and the many references therein ) .",
    "the study of large random matrices is also related to interesting questions in combinatorics , geometry , algebra and number theory .",
    "more recently , the study of large random matrices ensembles with additional structure have been considered .",

    "vandermonde matrices were defined in @xcite and were also called @xmath0fold vandermonde matrices . the case @xmath17 are the matrices in ( [ eqn_vandermondedefn ] ) . for @xmath18 ,",
    "these matrices are defined by selecting @xmath19 random vectors @xmath20 independently in the @xmath0dimensional hypercube @xmath21^{d}$ ] .",
    "these vectors are called the vectors of phases . given a scale parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "consider the function defined by @xmath22 such that for every vector of integers @xmath23 the value @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 it is easy to see that this function is a bijection over the set @xmath26 .",

    "this stems from the close relationship that unit magnitude complex vandermonde matrices have with the discrete fourier transform . among these",
    ", there is an important recent application for signal reconstruction using noisy samples ( see @xcite ) where an asymptotic estimate is obtained for the mean squared error .",
    "in particular , and as was shown in @xcite , generalized vandermonde matrices play an important role in the minimum mean squared error estimation of vector fields , as might be measured in a sensor network . in such networks ,",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is the dimension of the field being measured , @xmath19 is the number of sensors and @xmath3 can be taken as the approximate bandwidth of the measured signal per dimension .",

    "the matrix @xmath36 is an @xmath37 positive definite random matrix with eigenvalues @xmath38 the singular values of @xmath39 are by definition the eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",

    "<S> the other one is a more direct analytical approach involving combinatorics and complex analysis . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a lower bound for the maximum absolute value of a random complex polynomial on the unit circle , which may be of independent mathematical interest . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , for each sequence of positive integers @xmath6 we present a generalized version of the previously discussed matrices . the classical random vandermonde matrix corresponds to the sequence @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a combinatorial formula for their moments and we show that the limit eigenvalue distribution converges to a probability measure supported on @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that for the sequence @xmath9 the limit eigenvalue distribution is the famous marchenko  pastur distribution . </S>"
