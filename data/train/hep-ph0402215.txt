    "the electroweak scale of the standard model is destabilized by quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs mass squared .",
    "it has long been known that supersymmetry provides an elegant resolution to this naturalness problem by providing superpartners that cancel the quadratic divergences to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the absence of experimental evidence for superpartners roughly requires that they acquire supersymmetry breaking masses larger than of order the electroweak scale .",
    "the cancellation of the quadratic divergence is therefore inexact , requiring a fine - tuning of about one part in @xmath4 .",
    "this fine - tuning is minimized when the size of soft supersymmetry breaking is as close as possible to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the generic difficulty with such low superpartner masses is that they can lead to large contributions to flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and cp violating interactions at low energy .",
    "flavor - generic supersymmetry breaking leads to effective fcnc and cp violating operators that must be suppressed by tens to hundreds of tev to avoid conflict with experiment . raising the supersymmetry breaking scale",
    "sufficiently does solve the supersymmetric flavor problem , but at the expense of reintroducing a fine - tuning of at least one part in @xmath6 .",
    "avoiding this fine - tuning problem requires carefully arranging supersymmetry breaking to be mediated to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in a flavor - blind way .",
    "there are only a few known flavor - blind mediation mechanisms : gauge mediation @xcite , anomaly mediation @xcite , and gaugino mediation @xcite .",
    "gauge mediation , gaugino mediation , and several viable versions of anomaly mediation @xcite rely on specific uv physics to ensure flavor - blindness and an acceptable spectrum .",
    "gauge mediation generically requires a messenger sector to which the mssm is coupled only through gauge fields .",
    "gaugino mediation requires an extra dimension ( or deconstruction @xcite ) with only gauge fields propagating in the bulk .",
    "both frameworks require that the physics that explains the origin of flavor , such as froggatt ",
    "nielsen mechanism @xcite , must be well above the mediation scale such that the supersymmetric flavor problem is not reintroduced .",
    "anomaly mediation requires a mechanism to suppress supergravity contributions ( sequestering across a bulk @xcite or from a cft @xcite ) as well as a mechanism to generate positive slepton mass squareds . a qualitatively different approach ,",
    "uv insensitive anomaly mediation @xcite is the idea that soft breaking depends only on infrared ( ir ) physics through anomaly mediation ( sequestered using a bulk @xcite or cft @xcite ) and @xmath0-terms for hypercharge and @xmath7 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "uv insensitive supersymmetry breaking is highly predictive since all the supersymmetry breaking terms except for the @xmath0-terms can be calculated with known low energy coupling constants .",
    "the uv implementation of this model requires sequestering , to prevent the usual supergravity contributions to scalar masses , as well as a mechanism to generate @xmath0-terms @xcite .",
    "the virtue of this approach , however , is that the soft breaking masses are independent of these details of the uv physics . in this paper",
    "we carefully examine electroweak symmetry breaking in the mssm and extensions with a singlet superfield with supersymmetry breaking communicated via uv insensitive anomaly mediation .",

    "the large top yukawa coupling runs into a landau pole immediately above the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the mssm with uv insensitive anomaly mediation is therefore uv incomplete and must be replaced with an unknown theory above that scale .",
    "this does not cause an inconsistency of our framework because the soft terms are , by definition , uv insensitive .",
    "however , the large top yukawa coupling prevents us from obtaining an accurate estimate of the mass of the lightest higgs boson due to the importance of higher order radiative corrections .",
    "we then consider extensions of the mssm particle content by adding a singlet superfield in the hopes of finding a uv complete and calculable model . in sec .",

    "these flavors confine into composite mesons with a dynamically generated superpotential that is precisely of the form given above .",
    "what is perhaps most fascinating is that we find the parameter region with a stable electroweak breaking vacuum occurs for values of the couplings that are quite ordinary from the viewpoint of the fat higgs model .",

    "this suggests we should consider a model with no explicit mass parameters , such as the nmssm @xcite with superpotential @xmath101 since all the soft breaking parameters are loop suppressed , we naturally expect that no large values of the coupling constants will be needed .",

    "the origin of the difficulty in the nmssm is again due to the high predictability of anomaly mediation .",
    "the scalar mass parameter for the singlet @xmath103 is always positive .",

    "large superpotential couplings @xmath15 and @xmath104 induce a larger @xmath103 , that then suppresses the vev .",

    "nevertheless , in general there is a significant constraint on the region of parameters with @xmath218 because we find the mass of the lightest neutralino tends to be less than but of order @xmath219 . finally , a few comments on neutrinos and lepton flavor violation are in order .",
    "uv insensitive anomaly mediation naturally incorporates right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this is simply because three generations of right - handed neutrinos are required to gauge u(1)@xmath2 that itself is needed to allow the @xmath0-term for u(1)@xmath2 .",

    "several cosmological implications of anomaly mediation with uv insensitivity are quite interesting .",
    "the gravitino problem of supersymmetry are practically solved because it decays before the big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the gravitino is expected to decay into the lightest supersymmetric particle and other particles with hadronic or electromagnetic energy that thermalize quickly .",
    "therefore , the only constraint is that the gravitino is not too abundant before their decay so as not to overclose the universe through the lsp decay product .",

    "uv insensitive anomaly mediation predicts the lsp is the lightest neutralino that is mostly a singlino or a higgsino . in general",

    "for point i , the two neutral higgsino states have a vector - like mass of @xmath230 , while the determinant in the lower three - by - three matrix is @xmath231 .",
    "therefore the lightest neutralino has a mass of approximately @xmath232 and its wave function is @xmath233 despite the large @xmath16 , however , the mixing is not so small given a large @xmath234 .",
    "when @xmath235 , the @xmath236 and @xmath237 components in @xmath238 cancel in the coupling to the @xmath67-boson , while the annihilation due to the higgs exchange is also small due to the large higgs mass and its @xmath239-wave nature .",
    "the annihilation cross section is of the order of @xmath240  gev@xmath241 , while the correct abundance is obtained for @xmath242 .",
    "the neutralino is therefore overabundant in point i. however , there are viable parameter solutions in which the mass of the lightest neutralino is much closer to @xmath219 , and therefore the annihilation cross section is significantly enhanced by the @xmath67-pole in the @xmath239-wave .",
    "a completely separate possibility is that a would - be overabundant singlino is diluted by entropy production below the electroweak scale .",
    "conversely , for point ii the lightest neutralino has a large higgsino component ( 66.5% ) and a singlino component ( 33.3% ) .",

    "the annihilation cross section is of the order of @xmath244  gev@xmath241 .",
    "obviously the precise relic abundance of any particular set of parameters must be calculated carefully , but we are happy to find that the abundance varies around the cosmologically interesting value and the lightest neutralino ought to be a good dark matter candidate .    the moduli fields expected in most hidden sector models of supersymmetry breaking as well as string theory acquire their masses from supersymmetry breaking of the order of @xmath19 , and decay with a lifetime comparable to that of the gravitino .",
    "they are typically displaced from the minimum with an @xmath245 amplitude , dominating the universe before they decay , making big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) impossible .",
    "they also dilute any preexisting baryon asymmetry by @xmath246 .",

    "on the other hand , they decay before bbn , a major improvement in supersymmetric cosmology .    there are remaining concerns , however . for instance , if the moduli decay copiously into superparticles , they will eventually cascade down to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) that would overclose the universe ( assuming the lsp is stable and has an electroweak - scale mass ) @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that the lsp has a mass below about 1 gev and does not overclose the universe .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the axino , the fermionic superpartner of the invisible axion , is a possible candidate of a light lsp in the context of the gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking . in a typical gravity - mediated supersymmetry",
    "breaking , the axino acquires a mass of @xmath247 and this idea does not work @xcite . in anomaly mediation ,",
    "however , the axion lacks renormalizable couplings in the infrared and hence its mass is indeed suppressed by the inverse power of the decay constant .",
    "the axino is therefore a viable candidate for the lsp .",

    "<S> anomaly mediation solves the supersymmetric flavor and cp problems . this is because the superconformal anomaly dictates that supersymmetry breaking is transmitted through nearly flavor - blind infrared physics that is highly predictive and uv insensitive . </S>",
    "<S> slepton mass squareds , however , are predicted to be negative . </S>",
    "<S> this can be solved by adding @xmath0-terms for u(1)@xmath1 and u(1)@xmath2 while retaining the uv insensitivity . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider electroweak symmetry breaking via uv insensitive anomaly mediation in several models . </S>",
    "<S> for the mssm we find a stable vacuum when @xmath3 , but in this region the top yukawa coupling blows up only slightly above the supersymmetry breaking scale . for the nmssm , we find a stable electroweak breaking vacuum but with a chargino that is too light . replacing the cubic singlet term in the nmssm superpotential with a term linear in the singlet we find a stable vacuum and viable spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> most of the parameter region with correct vacua requires a large superpotential coupling , precisely what is expected in the `` fat higgs '' model in which the superpotential is generated dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore found the first viable uv complete , uv insensitive supersymmetry breaking model that solves the flavor and cp problems automatically : the fat higgs model with uv insensitive anomaly mediation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the cosmological gravitino problem is naturally solved , opening up the possibility of realistic thermal leptogenesis .    </S>",
