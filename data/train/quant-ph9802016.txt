    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that quantum computation can be performed effectively using an ensemble of ising spin systems at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> recent implementations of two - qubit quantum logic gates in an ensemble of spin systems require application of complicated sequences of electomagnetic pulses to the nuclear spins with very close resonant frequencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a simple single - pulse implementation of two - qubit quantum logic gate which can be realized in the systems with significant difference between the resonant frequencies . in order to understand the behavior of these systems </S>",
    "<S> , it is very important to perform numerical experiments of the dynamics of the single - pulse quantum logic gates and quantum computation for an ensemble of ising spin systems at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> recent suggestions for quantum computation assume the operations using quantum superpositional ( entangled ) states . </S>",
    "<S> the process of manipulating these states in theoretical studies is different from the process of implementation of these states in real physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> there are two main problems . </S>",
    "<S> one problem is that these superpositional states are not eigenstates of the corresponding hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> these superpositional states constantly change in time . </S>",
    "<S> one can not create time - independent superpositional states even for an isolated system . </S>",
    "<S> the second problem is that the dynamics of quantum computation involves both resonant and non - resonant interactions . </S>",
    "<S> non - resonant interactions are usually ignored , but they can inhibit the desired effects . for many physical problems ( for reasonably small interactions ) , </S>",
    "<S> the resonant dynamics dominates . in this case , the non - resonant dynamics plays an insignificant role which can be reasonably estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is completely different for quantum computations because non - resonant effects can accumulate with time , and create significant errors .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a numerical analysis of the quantum control - not ( cn ) gate at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the initial spin s frequencies differ significantly and the constant of interaction between spins is small enough , the non - resonant effects give small contribution to the dynamics , allowing the single - pulse quantum cn gate to be implemented in this system .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum cn gates are of the central importance for quantum computation </S>",
    "<S> . any quantum logic gate can be decomposed into a set of one - qubit rotations and cn gates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two - qubit gate can be described by the operator , @xmath4 the first number , @xmath5 , in @xmath6 refers to the control qubit , which does not change its value during the cn operation . </S>",
    "<S> the second number , @xmath7 , refers to the target qubit , which changes its value only if the control qubit has value `` 1 '' . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest cn gate can be implemented using only one @xmath0-pulse @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that , in fact , a @xmath0-pulse provides a modified cn gate , which differs from the `` pure '' cn gate ( 1 ) by a phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the desired feature of the cn gate remains : the @xmath0-pulse changes the state of the target qubit only if the control qubit has value `` 1 '' .    </S>",
    "<S> consider an ensemble of four - spin molecules at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> each molecule consists of four spins @xmath8 ; each spin interacts with the other three spins , through an ising interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the whole ensemble can be described by the density matrix , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of this system , in the reference frame rotating with frequency @xmath10 , circularly polarized in @xmath11 plane magnetic field , @xmath12 , is , @xmath13.\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] in ( 2 ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gyromagnetic ratio of each of the four spins ; @xmath16 is the permanent magnetic field which points in the positive @xmath17-direction , and is supposed to be different for different spins ; @xmath18 is the rabi frequency ; @xmath19 is the ising interaction constant . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider the case in which @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels for a single molecule containing four spins , for @xmath21 , are shown schematically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . the energy of the ground state is , @xmath22 the first four excited states in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 correspond to the one - spin excitations ; the next six states correspond to the two - spin excitations ; the next four states correspond to the three - spin excitations , and the last state , @xmath23 , corresponds to the total inversion of the spin molecule . for the density matrix formalism , it is convenient to use the decimal notation . in this notation </S>",
    "<S> we have , @xmath24 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . following the idea suggested in @xcite , we assume that ( using a particular sequence of electromagnetic pulses ) an ensemble of four - spin molecules is initially prepared in the state which can be described by the density matrix , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27.\\ ] ] in ( 6 ) , @xmath28 is the unit matrix , and @xmath29 is the deviation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the four states , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the `` active states '' , which are supposed to be manipulated without noticeable change in the other twelve states . in binary notation , the `` active states '' are @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> they are expected to evolve like the pure quantum states of a two - spin molecule . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the `` active states '' are marked by a `` bullet '' .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest cn gate for the system under consideration can be realized by a @xmath0-pulse with frequency @xmath33 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . for our case , we shall `` invert '' the convention . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we shall associate with the ground state , @xmath34 , of the spin , the value `` 1''of the qubit ; and the excited state , @xmath35 , with the value `` 0 '' .    </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0-pulse with the frequency @xmath36 is expected to drive the right spin only if the neighboring spin is in the ground state , i.e. , latexmath:[\\[|00ij>\\rightarrow \\cases{|00ij > , & if $ i=1$,\\cr    the overall phase factor . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath36 is unique frequency in this system . </S>",
    "<S> so , no other states are supposed to be changed by this pulse .    to analyze the dynamics of the cn gate , </S>",
    "<S> we first calculate the 16 diagonal and 64 non - zero off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , we solve numerically the system of 256 equations of motion for the matrix elements of the density matrix @xmath38 , for the initial conditions , @xmath39 @xmath40.\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) in ( 8) describe arbitrary initial conditions for the `` active part '' of the deviation density matrix , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , @xmath43 the deviation density matrix , @xmath44 with the initial condition ( 8) , was calculated numerically without any further approximations .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of these numerical calculations are shown in fig . 2 and 3 , for the following values of parameters , @xmath45 where @xmath31 . the characteristic </S>",
    "<S> dimensional parameters can be obtained , for example , by multiplying the parameters in ( 11 ) by @xmath46mhz . </S>",

    "<S> 2a , that under the action of a @xmath0-pulse , the coefficient @xmath48 ( curve 1 ) decreases monotonically from 1 to 0 , indicating the transition , @xmath49 curves 2 and 3 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a show the evolution of the imaginary and the real parts of the average spin , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , correspondingly , where @xmath52 @xmath53 the value of @xmath50 describes the precessing amplitude of the spin which is maximum when the average spin is in the @xmath11 plane .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b corresponds to the initial conditions , @xmath54 and describes the transition , @xmath55 fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c corresponds to the non - resonant initial conditions , @xmath56 fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d corresponds to the initial conditions , @xmath57 for both cases , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d , the population of the `` active states '' , @xmath32 , does not change with accuracy of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the population of all other `` passive states '' .    </S>",
    "<S> now we assume that under the action of a sequence of electromagnetic pulses we have a superpositional quantum state of a two - spin molecule , @xmath59 @xmath60 for an ensemble of four - spin molecules at room temperature the superpositional state ( 19 ) corresponds to the initial values of @xmath61 in ( 8) , @xmath62 we investigated the possibility of implementating a `` @xmath0''- pulse quantum cn gate for the ensemble of four - spin molecules .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show the evolution of the diagonal elements , @xmath63 , under the action of a @xmath0-pulse , for the initial conditions , @xmath64 one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , that at the end of a @xmath0-pulse we have : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 do not show a noticeable change . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the `` non - active '' diagonal elements , @xmath69 , ... , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a `` @xmath0''- pulse provides the implementation of the quantum cn gate for the superpositional initial conditions ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) as well as for the digital initial conditions ( 12 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the dynamics of quantum cn gate can be separated into two parts  resonant and non - resonant , and the non - resonant interaction plays a minor role when the resonant condition @xmath71 is satisfied , and the constant of interaction , @xmath72 , is small enough . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> our numerical calculations confirm the possibility of implementation of the quantum cn gate in an ensemble of quantum four - spin molecules , at room temperature , using a @xmath0-pulse . </S>",
    "<S> further numerical investigations are required to analyze the dynamical behavior of the system as a function of the frequencies , @xmath73 , in ( 11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the frequencies @xmath73 in ( 11 ) are close to each other , the resonant and non - resonant dynamics are expected to become more mixed . </S>",
    "<S> also , additional numerical experiments are required to analyze the creation of the initial state ( 6 ) , and to study the influence of sequence of @xmath0-pulses on the ensemble of spin molecules . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are now in progress . </S>"
