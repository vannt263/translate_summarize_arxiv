    "the ordered and disorder fixed - point tensors can be expressed exactly with a finite bond dimension , namely @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , whereas an exact expression of the critical fixed - point tensor @xmath84 is suspected to require an infinite bond dimension , and thus here we can only obtain an approximate representation .",

    "accordingly , table [ table ] shows that trg , an improved trg with environment , and tefr indeed produce excellent estimates of the scaling dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , tnr is seen to produce significantly better estimates .      as discussed in the main text and in appendix a ,",
    "when applied to the partition function of the critical ising model , tnr produces a flow @xmath172 in the space of tensors that quickly converges towards a fixed - point tensor @xmath84 . by fixed - point tensor @xmath84 we mean a tensor that remains the same , component by component , under further coarse - graining transformations",
    "this is the case up to small corrections that can be systematically reduced by increasing the bond dimensions @xmath3 ( see appendix a for quantitative details ) .",
    "thus , at criticality , tnr explicitly recovers scale invariance , as expected of a proper rg transformation .",
    "this is analogous to the explicit realization of scale invariance in critical quantum lattice models obtained previously with the mera @xcite ( and , ultimately , closely related to it @xcite ) .",

    "for instance , it led to identifying a lattice representation of the scaling operators of the theory , and the computation of the scaling dimensions and operator product expansion coefficients of the underlying cft @xcite .",
    "moreover , it produced an extremely compact representation of the wave - function of a critical system directly in the thermodynamic limit , avoiding finite size effects . in turn , this resulted in a new generation of approaches both for homogeneous critical systems @xcite and for critical systems with impurities , boundaries , or interfaces @xcite .",
    "finally , the scale - invariant mera has become a recurrent toy model as a lattice realization of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that the explicit invariance of @xmath84 , as realized by tnr , will be similarly fruitful .      in their trg paper @xcite ,",
    "levin and nave already argued that trg should not be expected to produce a fixed - point tensor at criticality .",

    "<S> @xcite , the _ breakdown _ of trg at criticality refers to the fact that ( 1 ) the computational cost to obtain a fixed accuracy in local expectation values increases as a critical point is approached , and ( 2 ) while trg flows to some fixed - point tensor off - criticality , this is no longer the case at criticality @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> tefr contains an _ entanglement filtering _ step designed to simplify cdl tensors @xcite by filtering out their short - range correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the filtering step allows tefr to recover the proper structure of non - critical rg fixed - points in contrast with trg@xcite , where for a given phase one obtains a continuum of fixed - point cdl tensors that only differ in short - range correlations . however , tefr can not simplify tensors near a critical point @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrary @xmath93-point correlator will then be computed by first inserting @xmath93 operators in the tensor network of eq . </S>",

    "<S> the role disentanglers play in tnr , where they remove short - range correlations , is analogous to their role in the context of entanglement renormalization of ground state wave - functions , where they remove short - range entanglement @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the gauge transformation is made such that the block of four @xmath22 tensors is manifestly invariant with respect to reflection along the horizontal axis , which is a convenient choice in order to preserve reflection symmetry in the network .    </S>",
    "<S> one should take into account the local environment , as described in ref.@xcite , when decomposing an auxiliary tensor @xmath36 , which may otherwise possess a slowly decaying spectrum of singular values that can not be accurately truncated .    </S>",
