    "this happened because the notion of derivative sets had not been developed at the time khmaladze and weil @xcite was accepted for publication . in this paper , the situation is different  extracting the one - dimensional limit theorem from theorem [ theo1 ] gives the following statement : _ if the set - valued function @xmath50 is differentiable in @xmath51 at @xmath52 and @xmath53 is its derivative _ ( see section [ sec3 ] or @xcite ) , _ then _ @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the set - parametric brownian motion defined just before lemma [ lemma1 ] , section  [ sec4 ] .    the local empirical process for one - dimensional @xmath56 , that is , the empirical process in the neighborhood of a point @xmath57 , is a classical object in probability theory , one which has proven to be very valuable in statistics ; see , for example , @xcite , the book by csrg and horvth @xcite and khmaladze @xcite .",

    "although the local empirical process near the boundary of a set is an interesting probabilistic object in its own right , the study of this type of process was mostly motivated by problems in spatial statistics .",
    "consider a family of distributions , indexed by some parameter @xmath59 , and denote by @xmath60 the log - likelihood ratio .",
    "if the parameter were a vector , as in parametric problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the local analysis of @xmath61 ( or any other process which the inference is based upon ) , in @xmath62 from the neighborhood of the true value @xmath59 , is a crucial step in asymptotic statistical theory .",
    "it forms , for example , the basis of contiguity theory .",
    "the situation is similar when the parameter is a function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has thus far not been known how to carry out such a local analysis when the parameter is a set .",
    "examples of set - parametric problems are provided by the class of spatial change point problems or _ change set problems _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in these problems , the observation is usually a ( marked ) point process in @xmath63 and the model assumption is that there is a set , or an image , @xmath13 , such that outside @xmath13 , the distribution of the point process ( e.g. , the distribution of the marks ) sharply changes .",
    "one can think of @xmath13 as , for example , an ore deposit site , a pollution site or a site with different magnetic properties .",
    "the literature on this problem is very broad ; see , for example , @xcite .    in most of the particular formulations of the change set problem ,",
    "the log - likelihood ratio @xmath64 is some form or another of the local empirical process ( [ lep ] ) , where @xmath13 plays the role of the true value of the change set , while the sets @xmath65 are small deviations from it . to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath66 be independent random vectors , with @xmath56 being ( as before ) a @xmath1-dimensional location and @xmath67 being a `` mark '' , not necessarily one - dimensional .",
    "write @xmath68 instead of @xmath65 in order to explicitly express the dependence on @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be the distributions of @xmath67 outside @xmath13 and on @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the log - likelihood ratio then has the form @xmath72 \\xi(y_i ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath73 .",

    ". let @xmath76 be a class of set - valued functions @xmath77 all converging to the same @xmath13 , that is , @xmath78 shrinks toward the boundary @xmath14 when @xmath21 .",
    "these sets describe the deviations from the hypothetical change set @xmath13 .",
    "let us consider the processes in ( [ plmi ] ) given on these deviations and investigate their joint limit in distribution when @xmath79 and @xmath28 : the larger the number of observations , the smaller , or narrower , the sets we consider .",
    "in the appropriate formulation of `` local alternatives '' , where not only @xmath68 tends to @xmath13 , but also @xmath71 tends to @xmath70 , when @xmath80 , the convergence to a gaussian limiting process  as shown in this paper  is of fundamental importance . indeed , although there is a rich literature on statistical estimation of sets , we know very few results on testing hypotheses about sets and no results for testing against local alternatives .    to illustrate another class of statistical problems where the parameter is a set , consider two prominent examples : the excess mass approach ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the shorth @xcite ) and its generalization @xcite . let @xmath32 be a fixed subset of @xmath10 , as in the canonical example .",
    "one could choose , for instance , @xmath32 to be the class of all ellipsoids .",
    "define the excess mass set @xmath13 for level @xmath81 by @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes @xmath1-dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "similarly , the generalized shorth or minimum volume set @xmath13 for probability @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 see @xcite when @xmath32 is the class of all ellipsoids .",
    "it turns out that both of these sets @xmath13 and their m - estimators can be analyzed somewhat similarly .",
    "therefore , we confine ourselves to the excess mass set .    the obvious non - parametric estimator for this set is obtained by replacing @xmath5 by @xmath86 : @xmath87 let @xmath88 be such that @xmath89 ( cf . the `` cube root asymptotics '' of @xcite ) . under certain conditions",

    "this random variable is the @xmath95 of some brownian motion with drift .",
    "such a result is very useful for a refined analysis of @xmath96 .",
    "see @xcite for a study of the behavior of such @xmath96 s along these lines .",
    "in this section , we first briefly review some relevant notation and facts from geometry .",
    "we then recall the concept of `` differentiation of sets in measure '' , as given in @xcite . in that paper and",
    "the references therein ( in particular @xcite ) , more details about the required geometry can be found .",
    "we also refer to the recent monograph @xcite .",
    "let @xmath97 be our convex body , that is , a closed , bounded convex set that has interior points .",
    "denote by @xmath98 the metric projection of @xmath99 on @xmath14 , that is , @xmath100 is a nearest point to @xmath101 on @xmath14 .",
    "the set of @xmath101-values for which such a nearest point is not unique is a subset @xmath102 of @xmath13 called the _ skeleton _ of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath83 denote @xmath1-dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "it is then known that @xmath103 .",
    "a unit vector @xmath104 is called an _ outer normal _ of @xmath13 at @xmath105 if there is some @xmath106 such that @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    ", we define the local interior reach @xmath112 if @xmath113 , then the outer normal @xmath104 at @xmath111 is unique . in this case ,",
    "the unit vector @xmath114 is the unique inner normal . in general , at each @xmath111 , we denote the set of outer normals by @xmath115 and the normal bundle of @xmath13 is defined as @xmath116 the cylinder @xmath117 $ ] will be important for describing our limiting processes .",
    "note , however , that it will eventually be possible to work with the cylinder @xmath45 $ ] , which is much easier to visualize .",
    "we also need the so - called local magnification map @xmath118 ; see @xcite .",
    "any point @xmath119 can be written as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the signed ( `` @xmath122 '' outside ) distance between @xmath101 and @xmath98 and @xmath104 an outer normal at @xmath98 that satisfies the equality .",
    "now , define @xmath123 observe that @xmath124 maps @xmath125 into @xmath126 .",

    "we require that the density @xmath6 can be approximated in the neighborhood of @xmath14 by a function depending only on @xmath98 and on whether or not @xmath150 .",
    "this latter possibility is easy to imagine in the change set problems : the limit of @xmath151 from inside @xmath13 can indeed be different from that from outside if @xmath13 is the change set .",
    "more formally , we require the existence of two functions , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , on @xmath14 such that , as @xmath21 , @xmath154 now , define a measure @xmath155 on @xmath126 as follows : @xmath156 for convenience , assume that @xmath152 and @xmath153 are bounded ( although a weaker , integrability , condition would suffice ) .",
    "an easy , but practically interesting , situation occurs when @xmath157 and @xmath158 for all @xmath111 , where @xmath159 are two constants .",
    "the following key result from @xcite shows the `` differentiability of sets in measure '' : if @xmath141 is differentiable at @xmath14 , then @xmath160",
    "let @xmath44 be as in section [ sec1 ] and assume @xmath161 .",
    "writing @xmath162 , it easily follows , using ( [ mp ] ) , that @xmath163 .",

    "( observe that for a thus converging sequence of borel subsets of @xmath126 , the limit set is not well defined .",
    "this limit `` set '' is actually an equivalence class of sets , defined by the property that for any two sets @xmath171 in the class , @xmath172 . out of every such an equivalence class , we choose one limit ( borel ) set @xmath146 , say .",
    "whether or not the conditions of our results are satisfied will depend on the choices of these @xmath146 s . in applications / examples , we should choose natural or appropriate @xmath146 s to make the theorems work . )",
    "consider the local empirical process ( [ lep ] ) from section [ sec1 ] . to establish its limit in distribution , we need the following steps .",

    "we denote these processes by @xmath182 ( local empirical processes of the latter type ",
