    "mirror symmetry is a surprising and yet to be further explored symmetry on the _ moduli space _ of calabi - yau ( cy ) varieties .",
    "it is usually referred to in the form of the slogan `` mirror symmetry exchanges the _ khler structure _ of a calabi - yau space with the _ complex structure _ of its mirror . '' + the simplest cy variety is the elliptic curve for which the above mirror phenomenon is mostly understood , see @xcite . as a complex variety , an elliptic curve has the form @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the upper - half plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 determines the `` shape '' of the lattice @xmath4 and captures the complex structure .",
    "a khler structure is described by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the standard complex coordinate system on ( the universal cover of ) @xmath7 .",
    "the khler form @xmath8 , satisfying @xmath9 , is taken to be the basis for the tangent space of the space of khler structures .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is a real positive number .    to make the space of khler structures a complex variety ,",
    "one introduces the `` b - field '' @xmath11 and considers the space of `` complexified '' khler structures of the form @xmath12 the condition @xmath13 gets translated into the condition @xmath14 on the `` complexified size '' @xmath15 .",
    "now we can describe the cy structure of an elliptic curve in terms of the two parameters @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the corresponding cy structure on the elliptic curve by @xmath17 . hereafter ,",
    "to avoid potential confusion , we shall use @xmath18 to denote the first copy of @xmath2 and @xmath19 the second one .",
    "+ mirror symmetry says that the mirror @xmath20 of @xmath17 is given by @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , it is a tautology that the space of complexified khler structures of @xmath22 is identified with the space of complex structures of @xmath23 and vice versa .",
    "it is in this sense that mirror symmetry exchanges the khler structure of a cy variety with the complex structure of its mirror .    among many other things",
    ", it also conjectures that the khler geometry ( a - model ) of an elliptic curve should be equivalent to the complex geometry ( b - model ) of its mirror elliptic curve , and vice versa .",
    "for example , the computation of genus zero _ gromov - witten invariants _ in the a - model can be translated into the study of _ variation of hodge structures _ in the b - model @xcite .",
    "the same story is conjectured to be true for general cy varieties but a complete and conceptual understanding is still lacking , see @xcite for a review on this subject .",
    "+ the above two spaces @xmath18 and @xmath19 are actually not the desired `` moduli '' spaces since a lot of points in each space should be identified .",
    "the space @xmath19 consisting of the @xmath3 s can be naturally regarded as the moduli space of complex structures with _",
    "markings _ , or alternatively the moduli space of marked polarized hodge structures .",
    "there is a natural @xmath24-action on @xmath19 which identifies different markings , yielding the quotient @xmath25 as the true moduli spaceof complex structures of the elliptic curve . by going from @xmath19 to @xmath26",
    "one simply forgets about the markings . + to meet the expectation from mirror symmetry",
    ", there should exist an @xmath24-action on @xmath18 as the mirror of the @xmath24-action on @xmath19 .",
    "while one of the generators of @xmath24 given by @xmath27 can be easily realized by thinking of the b - field as valued in @xmath28 , it is not easy to find a direct geometric interpretation of the other generator @xmath29 . + another motivation of studying these actions comes from understanding the quasi - modularity in the gromov - witten theory of the elliptic curve .",
    "it has been known that @xcite the generating series of simply branched coverings ( equivalently hurwitz numbers ) correspond to the fourier expansions of some quasi - modular forms @xcite for the modular group @xmath24 . in order to describe the modular group action on various constructions ( e.g. , hurwitz moduli spaces ) in the enumerative geometry which leads to the quasi - modularity",
    ", it seems necessary to understand the action of the @xmath30-transform on the parameter @xmath15 first . note that things would become much more clear on the mirror b - model @xcite where quasi - modularity is regarded as certain equivariance under the action of @xmath24 on the space @xmath19 .",
    "this expository note is aimed at finding a conceptual understanding of the @xmath24-action on the space of khler structures of the elliptic curve .",
    "we shall discuss some _ arithmetic structures _ that are involved in the mirror symmetry of elliptic curves .",
    "these arithmetic structures are studied very little ( comparing to the geometric structures ) in the literature .",
    "we hope that by revealing how they might come into the play for the elliptic curve case can shed some light on the studies of the mirror symmetry phenomenon in general .",
    "it is believed that in order to have a through understanding of the @xmath24-action , the space of complexified khler structures should be replaced by the space of suitable stability conditions @xcite . in this note",
    ", we shall however only present some mostly speculative discussions in elementary terms .",
    "+ in section [ seclattice ] we study the _ lattices _ that are involved in the mirror symmetry of elliptic curves which are responsible for the origins of the @xmath24-actions . in section [ sectorsion ]",
    "we discuss the role of the _ torsion _ in the lattices by studying the mirror of plane cubic curves as an example . in section [ secdualities ]",
    "we explain how the analytic continuation of the solutions to picard - fuchs equations can be used to detect part of the torsion structure and also reveal some _ dualities _ between different theories .",
    "section [ secyukawa ] is devoted to discussing the genus zero gromov - witten invariants of calabi - yau varieties and the _ weil - petersson geometry _ on their moduli spaces by making use of the picard - fuchs equations .",
    "this note is partially based on the talks the author gave at the frg workshop `` recent progress in string theory and mirror symmetry '' in may 2015 at brandeis university , the workshop `` uniformization , riemann - hilbert correspondence , calabi - yau manifolds , and picard - fuchs equations '' in july 2015 at institut mittag - leffler , and the workshop `` algebraic varieties '' in november 2015 at the fields institute .",

    "recall that @xmath19 is actually the moduli space of complex structures with extra structures on @xmath23 , namely the markings @xmath31 .",
    "now instead of focusing on how to interpret the space @xmath32 as a moduli space , one may ask whether @xmath18 is the moduli space of khler structures with certain extra structures on @xmath22 as well . a nave attempt is to regard the extra structure as a marking @xmath33 where @xmath34 is some rank @xmath35 lattice constructed from the ( co)homology of @xmath22 .      motivated by the connection to stability conditions and variation of hodge structures in the b - model , one",
    "is immediately led to a natural candidate of the markings in as described below .",
    "we first recall the standard notations from the theory of variation of hodge structures in the b - model on @xmath23 .",
    "the hodge bundle @xmath36 over @xmath19 is the pull back of the rank two trivial bundle via @xmath37 and the hodge line bundle @xmath38 the pull back of the tautological line bundle .",
    "locally , the latter has a unique ( up to scaling by a holomorphic function ) holomorphic section @xmath39 .",
    "a marking @xmath40 gives a symplectic basis of cycles @xmath41 in @xmath42 .",
    "denote their duals in @xmath43 , which is the local system that underlies @xmath36 , by @xmath44 respectively . a local trivialization of the hodge line bundle is @xmath45 for a generic section , one has @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the period integrals with respect to the basis @xmath41 .",
    "there is a similar story on the a - model which describes the variation of quantum cohomology ring , see for example @xcite for a nice account of these discussions .",
    "the relevant local system is the k - theory group @xmath48 which under the chern character isomorphism ( i.e. , tensoring over @xmath49 gives the isomorphism ) is identified with @xmath50 .",
    "after tensoring with @xmath51 , the latter glue to the hodge bundle @xmath36 over @xmath18 .",
    "the hodge line bundle @xmath52 has a local trivialization given by @xmath53 here the subscript @xmath54 in @xmath55 means that in the definition of @xmath39 as a formal series in @xmath56 , the ordinary cup product @xmath57 is replaced by the quantum product @xmath58 .",
    "similar to the b - model , one can choose a symplectic basis @xmath59 of @xmath60 to help describing the complexified khler structures .",
    "such a basis is determined by a marking @xmath61 then a generic local section @xmath39 can be described in terms of the period integrals @xmath62 by @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the dual basis of @xmath65 .    by comparing the datum in the a- and b - models , we can see that if we take the desired marking in to be the one given in , then indeed the corresponding @xmath24-action on @xmath18 meets all of the expectations from mirror symmetry .",
    "the lattice @xmath66 is usually referred to as the lattice of central charges in the language of stability conditions .",
    "+ the above discussion also tells that the space @xmath2 is actually not enough to capture the full information since the homothety is invisible on @xmath2 , which however is potentially useful in understanding the complete picture of mirror symmetry . to illustrate this",
    ", we recall that in the b - model of @xmath23 to restore the homothety one should consider the space of oriented basis in @xmath67 given by @xmath68 , see @xcite for a review . the @xmath24-action is described by @xmath69 if one only concentrates on the induced action on @xmath70 , one only obtains the relative length of the vector @xmath39 with respect to the marking @xmath41 and hence loses part of the information that @xmath39 contains .",
    "similarly , in the a - model , the chern character isomorphism gives @xmath71 if we specify a marking by taking @xmath41 to be the standard generators for @xmath72 respectively , then the periods are @xmath73 . only keeping the slope of the pair",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74 loses significant information of @xmath75 and the @xmath24-action .      with the rank @xmath35 lattice",
    "@xmath76 introduced into the story , the meaning of the @xmath30-transform is more clear .",
    "it acts by @xmath77 again by invoking the chern character isomorphism , it amounts to saying that the sheaf @xmath75 is sent to @xmath78 with @xmath79 the chern character of the abelian fourier - mukai transform of @xmath80 , had @xmath75 satisfied certain stability condition defined by the slope @xmath81 in , satisfy exactly this equation .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "this picture also seems to be helpful in understanding conceptually the modularity in the enumeration of hurwitz numbers of the elliptic curves .",
    "it is natural to expect that there is a moduli space construction of the hurwitz covers in terms of stable sheaves , and a generating series can be defined as a weighted sum .",
    "the fourier - mukai transform acts as an automorphism on this moduli space , and scales the weights by some overall factor .",
    "pulling out the overall factor gives the automorphy factor for the @xmath30-transform on the generating series as a modular form .",
    "however , special care needs to be taken care of on the boundary of the moduli space which is expected to be responsible for the quasi - modularity rather than modularity",
    ". we are not able to make this fully rigorous so far and wish to pursue this line of thought in the future .",
    "in the previous section we have already seen that the lattices play an important role in the mirror symmetry of the ( universal ) elliptic curve families .",
    "this is one place where some arithmetic structures start to enter the story .",
    "we shall now discuss the mirror symmetry for plane cubic curves as another example . in the sequel we shall see that structures like polarization and level structure determine the modular group symmetries on the moduli spaces on the two sides of mirror symmetry .",
    "the construction for the mirror manifolds of cy varieties was firstly carried out in physics and known as the orbifold construction @xcite .",
    "it was then realized as the polar duality between reflexive polytopes @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a nice review of the history and also more detailed discussions .",
    "we shall first review the construction of the mirror manifolds of the plane cubics via toric duality following the toric language in the textbook @xcite .",
    "consider the projective space @xmath83 as a toric variety .",
    "its fan @xmath84 is generated by the rays @xmath85 where @xmath86 the corresponding reflexive polytope @xmath87 is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 see figure [ figurepolyopefan ] below .",
    "@xmath91{polytopefan}\\ ] ]    the polar dual of the polytope @xmath92 is the convex hull of the vertices @xmath93 , with the corresponding fan @xmath94 generated by @xmath95 .",
    "this defines a new toric variety which is the mirror of @xmath82 , denoted by @xmath96 below . a more precise way to think about the new toric variety @xmath97 is to regard @xmath98 as a stacky fan and then the corresponding variety as a toric stack .    now by standard construction , one has the homogeneous quotient description @xmath99 one chooses the homogeneous toric coordinates on @xmath100 to be @xmath101 , corresponding to the toric invariant divisors @xmath102 respectively .",
    "then the @xmath103-action is given by @xmath104 similarly , one has @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the multiplicative cyclic group of order @xmath107 . by choosing the homogeneous toric",
    "coordinates on @xmath100 to be @xmath108 , the action of @xmath109 is then given by @xmath110      the toric duality @xcite says that the mirror cy manifolds of the cy variety , represented as sections of @xmath111 , are given by the sections of @xmath112 .",
    "a generic section of @xmath111 is determined by @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the character monomials corresponding to the lattice points @xmath115 .",
    "switching to homogeneous toric coordinates @xmath101 on @xmath116 , one has @xmath117 where the numbers @xmath118 are determined through the equation @xmath119 in the present case , one has @xmath120 .",
    "hence for example , we have @xmath121 the number of lattice points in @xmath87 is @xmath122 , corresponding to the number of cubic monomials in the homogeneous coordinates @xmath101 .",
    "the equation in defines a subvariety @xmath123 in @xmath124 .",
    "now we define a further @xmath103-action given by @xmath125 the quotient of the subvariety @xmath123 by the product of the above two @xmath103-actions defines a family of cubic curves which we call the family of plane cubics .",
    "the mirror family is given by @xmath126 there are only @xmath127 lattice points in @xmath128 , they give rise to the following monomials @xmath129 similar computations as above shows that the mirror family @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 here the @xmath132-action is described by @xmath133 henceforward we shall ignore the @xmath103-actions to simply the notations .      for a generic elliptic curve ,",
    "the dimensions of the space of complexified khler structures and of the complex structures are both one , it is hence a trivial statement that the dimensions involved on the two sides of mirror symmetry of plane cubics match .",
    "however , the base of the elliptic curve family @xmath130 given in is not @xmath19 as this family is apparently different from the universal family of elliptic curves with the markings @xmath40 .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask what is the true moduli space and what is the extra structure carried by the members in the family . + to answer these questions , we recall that by scaling the homogeneous coordinates , which amounts to quotient by the @xmath134-action and does not affect the discussions , the family @xmath130 is equivalent to quotient of the so - called hesse pencil @xmath135 by the @xmath106-action @xmath136 where @xmath137 this gives the same result produced by the orbifold construction @xcite for the mirror manifolds which will be reviewed below .",
    "the hesse pencil @xmath135 is actually the universal family over the modular curve @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the compatification @xmath140 .",
    "this modular curve is the moduli space of pairs @xmath141 , where @xmath142\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath143 $ ] being the group of @xmath107-torsion points of @xmath23 .",
    "this extra structure carried by the family is one kind of the level structure . as a result ,",
    "the family has @xmath144 flat sections corresponding to the @xmath107-torsion points ( i.e. , flex points ) of the plane cubic curves .",
    "computationally , that these sections are flat can be seen by observing that their projective coordinates are independent of the parameter @xmath145 .",
    "see @xcite for detailed discussions .",
    "+ taking the invariants of the @xmath106-action ( without modulo projectivization ) to be @xmath146 then the quotient is given by the following generically smooth complete intersection in @xmath147 @xmath148 we remark that the above form for the mirror curve is what appears in the hori - vafa construction @xcite for the mirror of some other closely related geometries . by computing the canonical sheaf using the adjunction formula , we can see that indeed this is a cy variety of dimension one , hence an elliptic curve .",
    "moreover , by going to the affine coordinates @xmath149 we are led to @xmath150 now the family @xmath151 still has the modular curve @xmath138 as its base and is also equipped with the @xmath107-torsion structure as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the two families @xmath135 and @xmath130 have equivalent variations of complex structures ( excluding the @xmath107-torsion structures ) and in particular the same picard - fuchs equations .",
    "for this reason , in the literature when discussing some complex - geometric aspects of the b - model , one usually takes @xmath135 as the mirror family .",
    "it is a classical result that the plane cubics with the @xmath107-torsion structure in can be embedded equivariantly into @xmath82 via theta functions .",
    "equivariance means that the translation actions by the elements in the group @xmath143 $ ] in the domain becomes some projective transformations on the image .",
    "more precisely , with the particular embedding given in for example @xcite , one has , using @xmath152 for some @xmath1 , @xmath153 note that these translations do not preserve the origin of the elliptic curve .",
    "the quotient by group of translations @xmath154 is exactly the one that gives the above @xmath107-isogeny in .",
    "the philosophy of mirror symmetry implies that in the a - model of the plane cubics one should also see some extra structure .",
    "the discussion in section [ seclattice ] suggests that the mirror should be the @xmath107-torsion in the lattice @xmath76 .    by going to the dual cohomology ,",
    "this amounts to saying that there exist natural locally constant elements in @xmath155 which generate a sub - lattice of index @xmath144 , denoted symbolically by @xmath156 .",
    "now under the chern character isomorphism , it suffices to find two sheaves @xmath157 on @xmath22 so that @xmath158 generate @xmath156 .",
    "these sheaves should be locally constant along the moduli space direction .",
    "this would be the case if they are obtained by natural pull backs from the ambient @xmath82 due to the simultaneous embedding of the fiber elliptic curves in the family .",
    "now it is easy to see that taking @xmath159 does the job .",
    "one can think of the elements in @xmath160 as some generalized version of polarizations which detect the `` sizes '' of the cycles in @xmath66 , then the above discussion implies that the torsion of polarization in the a - model is mirror to level structure in the b - model .",
    "this agrees with the constructions by syz mirror symmetry @xcite or fourier - mukai transform @xcite .",
    "we mentioned in the above that the @xmath107-isogeny in does not play a role in the complex geometry of the b - model . at first glance",
    ", the statement sounds unlikely to be true since after all , it is @xmath130 instead of @xmath135 which is the mirror of the plane cubics .",
    "the explanation is that although the quotient does not affect the complex geometry , it does has a non - trivial action on the khler and hence cy geometry of @xmath130",
    ". looked from the mirror side , the mirror action does not affect the khler geometry of @xmath123 much but is important for the complex geometry of @xmath123 .      again to motivate the discussion , we first recall the orbifold construction @xcite for the mirror of the quintic family , following the exposition in @xcite .    consider a generic quintic @xmath161 in @xmath162 .",
    "straightforward computation shows that @xmath163 the space of khler structures is spanned by the pull back of the hyperplane class in the ambient space @xmath162 . for the complex structure deformations , heuristically they correspond to the vector space @xmath164 of degree-@xmath165 monomials in the @xmath165 homogeneous coordinates on @xmath162 .",
    "the group @xmath166 acts by bi - holomorphisms .",
    "after projectivization , the space of complex structure deformations has dimension @xmath167",
    "this then yields the universal family @xmath168 of quintics in @xmath162 .",
    "now mirror symmetry predicts that a generic member @xmath169 in the mirror family @xmath170 should satisfy @xmath171 consider the action of diagonal symmetries @xmath172 one can understand this group as the one in the homogeneous quotient in constructing the mirror @xmath173 of @xmath162 in a way similar to using toric duality .",
    "the vector space @xmath164 then decomposes into sums of representations @xmath174 here in the direct sum @xmath175 runs over the space of non - trivial characters .",
    "the representation @xmath176 with trivial character is spanned by @xmath177\\,.\\ ] ] under the action of @xmath166 , the space @xmath176 gives an one - parameter family of quintics in @xmath162 , called the dwork pencil , @xmath178 then one takes the quotient @xmath179 of @xmath180 by the @xmath181-action .",
    "the members in the resulting family are singular varieties .",
    "one applies a resolution of singularity to obtain a family of smooth varieties .",
    "the mirror manifold is declared to be the resolution @xmath182 note that the members @xmath169 in this family are not simultaneously embedded into @xmath162 anymore due to the quotient which produces singularities and brings in the resolution . again a heuristic counting of @xmath183 is given as follows .",
    "the resolution creates exceptional divisors which under the poincar dual contribute to @xmath183 , then @xmath184 the counting gives the desired number @xmath185 .",
    "see @xcite for references which offer rigorous approaches in proving the results on dimensions .",
    "in retrospect , we can see that the group @xmath181 plays two roles .",
    "the first is to cut down the dimension of space of complex structure deformations by keeping only the @xmath181-invariants .",
    "the resulting family is still simultaneously embedded in @xmath162 .",
    "the second is to increase the dimension of space of khler structure deformations by forming the quotient followed by resolution , at the price of losing the simultaneous embedding .",
    "if we only care about the variation of complex structures of @xmath170 , for example if we only focus on variation of periods , then @xmath180 is already enough .",
    "this is in fact what is customarily done in the literature : one uses the picard - fuchs equation for @xmath180 in computing the periods of @xmath170 , see @xcite .",
    "note also that if we regard @xmath179 as an orbifold , then the additional khler structure deformations coming from the resolution correspond to some twisted sectors in the chen - ruan cohomology @xcite of the orbifold .",
    "hence the orbifold and its resolution contain the same amount of information on the khler structure deformations .",
    "now we can interpret the above results in terms of the diagram in figure [ figurequintic ] .",

    "the inverse changes the dimension of the space of complex structure deformations by turning on the deformations along the monomials in the space @xmath187 .",
    "while the @xmath181-action on the up - right arrow is used to form the orbifold quotient , it does not change the dimension of complex structure deformations .",
    "its inverse keeps the @xmath181-invariants of the @xmath188 part in the chen - ruan cohomology of the orbifold @xmath189 .",
    "now we extend what we have learned from the quintic family case to the plane cubics .",
    "note the dimensions of the spaces of khler structures and complex structures for the elliptic curve and its mirror , or the corresponding hodge numbers , are always one.in order to figure out the different roles of the families that are involved in the mirror construction , what we should be focusing on are the dimensions of the space of deformations created by the torsions in the corresponding lattices , which we call twisted sectors borrowing the terminology from physics .",
    "we use the notations @xmath190 to denote the corresponding dimensions .    by analogy from the quintic family",

    "one has @xmath192 since the lattice @xmath76 is decorated with its @xmath107-torsion .",
    "the statement that @xmath193 comes from the dimension count of the vector space of cubic monomials modulo @xmath134-action .",
    "the @xmath181-action on the down - right arrow keeps only the @xmath181-invariant cubic monomials , leaving the @xmath107-torsion in @xmath76 unchanged as the simultaneous embedding into @xmath82 remains .",
    "in addition , the resulting family @xmath135 has the @xmath107-torsion structure in @xmath194 . for the up - right arrow , the orbifold quotient on the family @xmath195 does not preserve the original simultaneous embedding into @xmath82 and hence the @xmath107-torsion in @xmath76",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the map in destroys the original ambient space @xmath82 .",
    "this results in the counting @xmath196 .",
    "however , as explained in the paragraph below , the new family carries a new @xmath107-torsion structure in @xmath197 and thus @xmath198 .",
    "the notation @xmath199 means that this new @xmath107-torsion structure is different from the one on @xmath195 .",
    "+ it appears that studying the torsion structures offer some new insights in understanding the modularity in the gromov - witten theory of the elliptic orbifold curves , see @xcite .",
    "these structures , which are rooted in the symmetries of the families , are also closely related to the studies of oscillating integrals and gkz hypergeometric functions in the appearance of chain integrals .",
    "this will be discussed in a forthcoming work .",
    "for either the family @xmath135 or @xmath130 , the fibers over @xmath145 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 are isomorphic . in particular , for the hesse pencil , the isomorphism is induced by the projective transformation @xmath202\\mapsto [ \\rho_{3 } x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}]\\,.\\ ] ] for simplification , one usually applies a base change @xmath203 .",
    "the resulting two families would then have the base being a copy of @xmath204 parametrized by @xmath205 .",
    "they are again related by the @xmath107-isogeny mentioned before and have equivalent variations of complex structures .    for definiteness",
    ", we shall discuss the base change of @xmath130 , which we still denote by the same symbol by abuse of notation , @xmath206 it is known that @xmath207 are the hauptmoduln for the modular groups @xmath208 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the family @xmath130 in is actually the universal elliptic curve family over the modular curve @xmath209 which is the moduli space of pairs @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is an elliptic curve and @xmath212 is a cyclic subgroup of order @xmath107 of @xmath213 $ ] .",
    "the underlying modularity and moduli space interpretation is very useful in analyzing symmetries of the families , see for example @xcite .",
    "there is a particular involution on the moduli space @xmath209 given by @xmath214/h)\\,.\\ ] ] it is represented by the fricke involution on @xmath139 @xmath215 with a suitable choice for the haupmodul @xmath216 , see @xcite , the fricke involution induces the affine transformation @xmath217 note that although the two points @xmath218 , corresponding to @xmath219 have the same @xmath220-invariant , the above transformation that is induced from the moduli interpretation is not the @xmath30-transform but the fricke involution @xmath221 which does not lie in @xmath24 . in particular it does not belong to the deck group of the covering @xmath222 .",
    "this involution plays a very important role in the mirror symmetry of some special non - compact cy threefolds @xcite",
    ". also in the seiberg - witten theory @xcite , the fricke involution is what underlies the electro - magnetic duality , see @xcite for more discussion on this .",
    "+ one could have found this involution on the family without using the underlying modularity but by using the picard - fuchs equation for this family . in the studies of mirror symmetry for more general cy varieties ,",
    "the former is usually difficult to make sense of while the latter is typically what one can easily obtain .",
    "we now explain how this works following the discussions in @xcite .",
    "+ recall that the picard - fuchs operator for the family @xmath130 in is @xmath223 this can be deduced by using , for example , the griffiths - dwork method for the hesse pencil and then use the fact that the isogeny does not affect the picard - fuchs equation .    the resulting picard - fuchs equation @xmath224 has three singularities located at @xmath225 .",
    "around each point , one chooses an appropriate local coordinate to rewrite the picard - fuchs equation and then can find a local basis in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "in particular , near the point @xmath226 , one adapts the local coordinate @xmath227 and rewrite the picard - fuchs equation as @xmath228 the picard - fuchs operator in the @xmath229-coordinate takes exactly the same form as the one written in the @xmath205-coordinate .",
    "this means that if @xmath230 is a solution , then @xmath231 is a solution as well .",
    "hence one finds the symmetry @xmath232 on the level of periods .",
    "moreover , one can choose a suitable basis @xmath233 of solution near @xmath234 and then define the normalized period to be @xmath235 it has logarithm growth as @xmath205 goes to zero and lies on the upper - half plane .",
    "moreover , a particular basis @xmath236 can be chosen such that the local monodromy near @xmath234 is given by @xmath237 .",
    "these two solutions are period integrals over the vanishing cycles @xmath41 at the singularities @xmath218 respectively .    in fact ,",
    "this choice of basis satisfies the property @xcite that @xmath238 , where the parameter @xmath3 is the modular variable satisfying @xmath239    then one can check that @xmath240 hence one recovers the fricke involution .",
    "that is , the monodromy consideration naturally singles out the correct variable @xmath241 and the correct form for the involution on the moduli space .",
    "similarly , one can take a suitable basis of periods near the orbifold point @xmath242 and then form the normalized period @xmath243 there . by using the analytic continuation formulas of hypergeometric series @xcite , it follows that @xmath244 for some @xmath245 with @xmath246 .",
    "this factional linear transform between the normalized periods is the cayley transform based at the point @xmath245 on the upper - half plane .",
    "it turns out that this simple transformation , induced by analyzing the picard - fuchs equation , is @xcite what underlies the calabi - yau / landau - ginzburg correspondence @xcite for the elliptic orbifold curves .",
    "this correspondence is another interesting physics duality which has attracted a lot of attention in mathematics .",
    "+ the idea of using the picard - fuchs equation to detect dualities applies to other models of elliptic curve families and also some related geometries , see e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the important predictions of mirror symmetry is that calculation on the genus zero gromov - witten invariants of a cy variety can be turned into computation on period integrals of the mirror cy variety @xcite . in this section , we shall review how this works by discussing a few examples .",
    "in the course we shall also see that the picard - fuchs equations can be very useful in studying the weil - petersson metric on the deformation space of cy varieties .",
    "it is well - known that the genus zero gromov - witten invariants of the elliptic curve @xmath22 are trivial in nonzero degree .",
    "one can see this by employing the definition of these invariants and checking that the integrals are always trivial due to dimension reasons @xcite .",
    "this then implies the following identity on the generating series of these invariants called yukawa coupling , @xmath247 the numbers @xmath248 are the genus zero degree @xmath249 gromov - witten invariants .",
    "the miracle of mirror symmetry says that @xcite the above generating series can be computed in the b - model through @xmath250 here the cycle @xmath251 is the vanishing cycle near @xmath252 and the holomorphic top form @xmath39 is given in .",
    "the mirror map sends the khler structure parameter @xmath15 to the complex structure @xmath3 , as discussed in section [ secintro ] .",
    "an easy computation shows that indeed that @xmath253    since the gromov - witten invariants are deformation invariant , in the a - model we can take any reasonably behaved family . then by mirror symmetry , the family in the b - model could be any nicely behaved family .",
    "in particular we can take the plane cubics to be the a - model .",
    "then the mirror is the family @xmath130 described earlier in .",
    "now the yukawa coupling is given by @xmath254 with @xmath255 here @xmath256 is the integral of the holomorphic top form @xmath39 on the vanishing cycle @xmath251 near the point @xmath234 , coresponding to @xmath252 according to .",
    "the quantity @xmath257 satisfies a first order differential equation which is easily derived from the picard - fuchs equation @xmath224 . solving this equation ,",
    "one gets a rational function @xmath258 then the result @xmath259 follows from the schwarzian equation for @xmath241 .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "now if one applies the same discussion to a general algebraic family of elliptic curves , then by using , and , one would produce interesting identities which are otherwise difficult to check directly .",
    "for example , consider the @xmath260 elliptic curve family , see @xcite , @xmath261 one gets the following identities , see also @xcite , @xmath262    alternatively , all of these can be checked by using the fact that the parameter @xmath216 is the haupmodul for some modular group and has very nice expressions in terms of @xmath263-or @xmath264-functions , and that the periods are also related to modular forms .",
    "see @xcite for detailed discussions .",
    "similar to the elliptic curves , the gromov - witten invariants of k3 surfaces are also trivial .",
    "then the same reasoning above is supposed to yield non - trivial identities involving special functions .",
    "see @xcite for related discussions .",
    "we consider the dwork pencil as the b - model for example .",
    "the equation for the family is given by @xmath265 the picard - fuchs operator is given by the hypergeometric differential operator @xmath266 an easy computation @xcite gives the yukawa coupling in the parameter @xmath267 @xmath268 by considering the indicial equation at the regular singular point @xmath269 , we know that we can choose a basis so that only one of them is regular , the other two have @xmath270 behavior near @xmath269 .",
    "we denote these three periods near @xmath269 by @xmath271 , respectively .",
    "for example , we can take them to be the ones obtained by using the frobenius method @xmath272 here @xmath273 and @xmath274 , while @xmath275 are some constants .",
    "we also define the normalized period to be @xmath276 note that a different choice for the basis @xmath277 , with the constraints that for some constants @xmath278 @xmath279 induces an affine transformation on @xmath280 and hence a scaling on the yukawa coupling @xmath281 it is known that up to scaling the parameter @xmath280 is mirror to the khler structure parameter @xmath15 in the a - model , see @xcite . since @xmath282 , we know @xmath283 for some constant @xmath284 .",
    "therefore we are led to @xmath285 this then gives a non - trivial identity involving the hypergeometric series @xmath286 .",
    "+ having carried out the computations using picard - fuchs equation , one might wonder whether there exists some structure like modularity which underlies this , similar to the elliptic curve case .",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "to proceed , we first note that the picard - fuchs operator @xmath287 is actually is the symmetric square of some second order differential operator @xcite @xmath288 in the sense that @xmath289 near @xmath269 one can take a basis of solutions to @xmath290 to be @xmath291 the second solution @xmath292 is interpreted as the analytic continuation near @xmath269 and hence has @xmath293 behavior .",
    "one can then check the symmetric square structure directly .",
    "for example , the relation @xmath294 follows from clausen s identity .",
    "now we pick the following basis satisfying the conditions in @xmath295 then we get @xmath296 we then treat @xmath280 as the normalized period for the equation @xmath297 .",
    "this gives the relation @xcite @xmath298 then follows easily .",
    "the above discussion only used the symmetric square structure and no relation to elliptic curve family or modular forms is relied on .",
    "in fact , the parameter @xmath267 is the hauptmodul for the modular group @xmath299 , where the triangular group @xmath299 is the fricke extension of the modular group @xmath300 . the corresponding `` universal '' ( modulo the issue of orbifold ) elliptic curve family over the modular curve @xmath301 is the @xmath302 elliptic curve family @xmath303 the picard - fuchs operator is @xmath304 where @xmath205 is the haupmodul for @xmath305 given in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the haupmodul @xmath267 is related to @xmath205 by @xmath306 hence the solutions @xmath307 are actually related to the periods of the elliptic curve family which are in turn related to modular forms for @xmath305 .",
    "this connection can then be used to give another proof of by using modular forms .    since",
    "our intention is to study the properties by using the picard - fuchs equations only , we shall not discuss the details .",
    "we wish to address the modularity and the application in gromov - witten theory of k3 orbifold surfaces somewhere else .",
    "it is however worth pointing out that the symmetric square structure follows from the fact that the k3 surface family in consideration is polarized by some special lattices .",
    "furthermore the k3 surfaces are hodge - theoretically isomorphic to the kummer varieties constructed from the elliptic curve family in .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the symmetric square structure is essentially what leads to all these results , it is therefore natural to ask when a third order ode is the symmetric square of a second order one",
    ". this is an independent question on differential operators .    for a second order ode @xmath308 its symmetric square",
    "is computed to be @xmath309 hence a third order ode which admits a symmetric square structure must have the form displayed above .",
    "the condition of being a symmetric square can be more conveniently phrased in terms of the coefficients in the normal form of the differential operator , see @xcite for detailed discussions .",
    "as discussed above , for k3 surfaces , the symmetric square structure implies and leads to the triviality of genus zero gromov - witten invariants .",
    "one might wonder whether the same thing can be said for cy threefolds .",
    "+ consider for simplicity the one - parameter case .",
    "we assume the family in the b - model @xmath310 has a nice description in terms of algebraic varieties .",
    "we also choose a local coordinate system @xmath267 on @xmath311 in which the equation of the cy family and hence the picard - fuchs system is naturally written .    under mirror symmetry ,",
    "the `` large volume limit '' @xmath312 in the space of khler structures , around which the gromov - witten theory is defined , is mapped to the so - called `` large complex structure limit '' @xcite which we assume is given by @xmath269 .",
    "the mirror map then induces a new local coordinate system near the large complex structure limit which we also denote by @xmath15 .",
    "+ the base @xmath311 is equipped with the weil - petersson metric whose khler potential @xmath313 is defined by @xmath314 where @xmath39 is a local holomorphic section of the hodge line bundle over the base @xmath311 .",
    "the weil - petersson geometry has many nice properties known as special geometry @xcite .",
    "one property is that near the large complex structure limit point @xmath267 on @xmath311 , there exists a holomorphic function @xmath315 called prepotential so that the periods with respect to a symplectic basis of @xmath316 has the structure @xmath317 moreover , the yukawa coupling , as the mirror counterpart of the generating series of genus zero gromov - witten invariants of the cy family @xmath123 in the a - model , is related to the prepotential @xmath315 by @xmath318 the prepotential has the following general form , see @xcite and references therein , @xmath319 where @xmath320 are some real constants depending on the family @xmath123 .",
    "now we can immediately see that the existence of a symmetric cubic structure on the picard - fuchs equation is equivalent to the statement that @xmath315 is cubic in @xmath15 , or @xmath321 that is , all of the gromov - witten invariants of non - zero degree vanish .",
    "this is rarely the case for cy threefolds .",
    "see @xcite for examples and further discussions .",
    "+ similar to the symmetric square case , the criteria for the symmetric cubic structure can be phrased in terms of some invariants constructed out of the coefficients of the ode , see @xcite .",
    "the weil - petersson metric for any cy family is defined through the same formula in .",
    "it is easy to see that for elliptic curve families or the one - parameter k3 families admitting the symmetric square structure , the normalized period takes values in the upper - half plane and the weil - petersson metric is exactly the poincar metric . + for cy threefold families , by restricting to an one - dimensional slice , one has @xmath322 this gives rise to the poincar metric if and only if the summation of the terms on the right hand side of the above expression , except for the cubic term in @xmath323 , is zero .",
    "this implies @xmath324 or equivalently @xmath325 .",
    "that is , for an one - parameter family , the weil - petersson metric on the base of the cy family is the quantum correction ( by genus zero gromov - witten invariants ) of the poincar metric .",
    "this is expected by schmid s @xmath326-orbit theorem @xcite .",
    "similar statements also hold for multi - parameter families .",
    "interestingly , from the weil - petersson metric on the base , one can define differential rings @xcite which exhibit similar structures as the rings of quasi - modular and almost - holomorphic modular forms @xcite defined from the poincar metric and seem to provide generalizations thereof .",
