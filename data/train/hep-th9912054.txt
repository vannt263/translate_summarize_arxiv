    "the apparently simplest model of space - time beyond minkowski space is de sitter space .",
    "its high ( maximal ) degree of symmetry makes it the typical framework to investigate quantum field theory outside flat space .",
    "+ one of the essential ingredients of quantum field theory are the various green functions of the fields . for the scalar field on de sitter space ,",
    "the first work on the subject is , in our knowledge , the paper of ghniau and schomblond @xcite .",
    "these authors have used the harmonicity property of de sitter space , i.e. the possibility to solve klein - gordon equation by a function depending only on the geodesic distance , to obtain the expression of the pauli - jordan propagator @xmath0 .",
    "soon after , cahen , ghniau , gnther and schomblond @xcite have obtained the expression of the analogous green function @xmath1 for the spinorial field .",
    "their method consisted essentially to compute @xmath1 first with @xmath2 fixed at the origin of a coordinate patch , and then , to generalize the expression so obtained for an arbitrary couple of points by using parallel transport .",
    "later , schomblond and one of the authors of this work ( ph.s ) have obtained a fock space description of the scalar @xcite , spinorial and vectorial @xcite propagators by computing them as mode sums . the main result in @xcite was that by imposing invariance conditions ( with respect to the isometries of the space ) and fixing the behaviour at short distances of the propagator , a uniqueness theorem holds .",
    "all ambiguities about the definition of particles , expressed by arbitrary bogoljubov s transformations , are resolved . at the same time",
    ", candelas and raine @xcite obtained a similar result using the harmonicity properties of the space to write a schwinger representation of the feynman propagator depending only on the geodesic distance and satisfying a regularity boundary condition ( imposed on the kernel of the schwinger representation ) .",
    "+ let us emphasize that , for the massless scalar field ( @xmath3 ) , it is impossible to obtain a fully de sitter invariant vacuum state .",
    "this result was first noticed by spindel @xcite and independently rediscovered in 1982 by vilenkin and ford @xcite .",
    "it has been discussed in details by allen and folacci @xcite .",
    "allen has also obtained explicitly de sitter invariant representations for the green functions of the spinorial , vectorial and gravitational fields @xcite , under the assumption a priori that these green functions could be expressed in terms of products of functions of the geodesic distance with maximally symmetric bispinors or bitensors .",
    "+ a drawback of this geometrical construction of the green functions is that we have no information about the existence of an underlying fock space , i.e. a vacuum state such that expectations values of fields products with respect to it give the corresponding green functions .",
    "actually , for the gravitational field , the situation is the same as for the massless spin 0 field @xcite : there exists de sitter invariant green functions , but no corresponding vacuum state .",
    "representations of these green functions have been obtained by allen and turyn @xcite and by antoniadis and mottola @xcite . both results , which differ only by gauge choice ,",
    "are obtained as analytic continuation of green functions built on the euclidean 4-sphere .",
    "a direct evaluation of the gravitational propagator as mode sums in physical space ( de sitter space ) has been done by tsamis and woodard @xcite .",
    "their construction leads to a result analogous to the one already obtained for the massless , minimally coupled scalar field : there is no de sitter invariant vacuum state for the massless spin 2 field .",
    "+ in this note , we shall perform the calculation of the propagator for the  massive spin 2 field \" . more precisely , we consider the gravitational perturbation field equations introduced by lichnerowicz @xcite , which corresponds to a mixture of spin 0 and spin 2 fields . in section 2 , we summarize the field equations and remind the mode sums representations of the various propagators . in the third section ,",
    "we specialize the field equations on ( 3 + 1 ) de sitter space and solve them explicitly on a half de sitter space .",
    "we then obtain the propagators by summing modes . in section 4 ,",
    "we establish coordinate - free and manifestly @xmath4 invariant representations of the propagator . in section 5,we",
    "discuss quickly the analytic continuation of the modes and propagators on the full de sitter space .",
    "following lichnerowicz @xcite , we write the equations of motion for  massive metric perturbations \" on an einstein background space @xmath5 as @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( * h * ) denotes the terms linear in the components of the tensor * h * in the expansion of the ricci tensor evaluated on the metric * g* = * g * + * h*. the factor @xmath8 on the right hand side of eq.([1 ] ) is related to a mass term as @xmath9 . this definition of mass is meaningful because @xmath10 corresponds to pure gravity . hereafter , we shall denote by @xmath11 the eigenvalues of the quadratic casimir operator @xmath12 considered by brner and drr @xcite who have used the notations @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see eq.([46 ] ) ) .    from the bianchi identities , written for the metric * g*",
