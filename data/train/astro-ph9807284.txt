    "the hipparcos astrometry satellite has provided very accurate positions , proper motions , and parallaxes for about 118000 stars ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "many people may therefore be inclined to think that , at least for the stars observed by hipparcos , the ground - based observations , collected over more than two centuries , are of no use anymore .",
    "it is correct that the systematic accuracy of the hipparcos data is so high that the system represented by the hipparcos positions and proper motions ( icrs ) is superseding the earlier system ( fk5 ) , derived from ground - based measurements .",
    "however , the random ( ` individual ' ) accuracy of the hipparcos data , especially of the proper motions , can nevertheless be significantly improved and checked by ground - based astrometric measurements .",
    "why is that so ?",
    "the main reasons are : ( 1 ) the lower accuracy of older ground - based measurements of stellar positions is often compensated by the large spread in the epochs of observations .",
    "this allows us to derive very accurate proper motions from the ground - based data alone or from a combination with hipparcos results ( wielen 1988 ) . ( 2 ) due to undetected astrometric binaries , the hipparcos proper motions can deviate significantly from the more typical proper motions of the center - of - mass ( wielen 1995b , 1997 , wielen et al .",
    "hipparcos proper motions are derived essentially as ` instantaneous ' proper motions from data collected within about 3 years only .",
    "in contrast , the ground - based observations cover often more than two centuries .",
    "the derived proper motions are then already rather close to ` time - averaged ' or ` mean ' proper motions . hence the ground - based results allow often to identify and to correct ` cosmic errors ' in the instantaneously measured hipparcos proper motions .",
    "in this section , we shall describe a simple averaging method for combining the hipparcos data ( esa 1997 ) with that of a ground - based compilation catalogue , such as the fk5 ( fricke et al . 1988 ) or the gc ( boss et al . 1937 ) .",
    "the method neglects some of the correlations between the hipparcos results for a given star , namely the correlations between the results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and with the parallax .",
    "the advantage of the simple averaging method is its transparency which allows easily to grasp the basic advantages and problems in combining two ( or more ) catalogues .",
    "the results for the error estimates have been already presented earlier ( wielen 1988 ) .",
    "our method assumes that the two catalogues to be combined are based on completely independ measurements .",
    "this is always fulfilled in combining ground - based measurements with hipparcos data .    before combining the two catalogues",
    ", we have to reduce them to a common system of positions and proper motions . in practice",
    "this means at present that we have to reduce the ground - based catalogues to the hipparcos system .",
    "this can be done , for example , by using methods such as adopted in the construction of the fk5 ( bien et al .",
    "1977 ) .",
    "we call the position in one coordinate ( say in declination @xmath1 ) @xmath2 , the corresponding proper motion @xmath3 , and the central epoch @xmath4 .",
    "the epoch @xmath4 is chosen such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not correlated .",
    "the central epochs @xmath4 are usually given explicitly in ground - based catalogues .",
    "for hipparcos , the individual epoch @xmath4 ( and the corresponding position @xmath5 ) can be easily derived from the data given in the hipparcos catalogue ( see e.g. wielen 1997 , p. 374 ) .",
    "the mean measuring errors of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are called @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for systematically corrected ground - based catalogues",
    ", these mean errors have to include the uncertainty of the applied systematic corrections ( e.g. wielen et al .",
    "for hipparcos we use the index @xmath8 , for the ground - based catalogue the index @xmath9 , and for the catalogue obtained by combining the two catalogues the index @xmath10 .",
    "the main conceptional device for combining the two catalogues is the introduction of a third proper motion @xmath11 , which is based on the two central positions ( wielen 1988 , 1995a ) : @xmath12 the mean error of @xmath11 is given by @xmath13 we introduce the following ` weights ' @xmath14 : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 it can be shown that the position @xmath20 , the proper motion @xmath21 , and the central epoch @xmath22 of the star in the combined catalogue @xmath10 can be derived as ` weighted averages ' .",
    "the proof is not given here .",
    "the result is based on the reconstruction of the full normal equations for the two unknowns @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the catalogued data @xmath23 .",
    "the method is an extended version of those described by kopff et al .",
    "( 1964 ) or by eichhorn ( 1974 , section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "we obtain for the weights in the combined catalogue @xmath10 : @xmath24 @xmath25 the new central epoch @xmath22 is given by @xmath26 the position @xmath20 at @xmath22 follows as @xmath27 the combined proper motion @xmath21 is the weighted average of the three proper motions @xmath28 and @xmath11 : @xmath29 the mean errors @xmath30 and @xmath31 of @xmath32 and @xmath21 are derived from @xmath33 @xmath34 hence we have now obtained all the desired quantities for the combined catalogue @xmath10 .    in real applications , such as the fk6 ( see section 3 )",
    ", the proper motion @xmath11 is often very accurate and governs the combined proper motion @xmath21 . for the positions , the accuracy of the hipparcos position is usually by an order of magnitude higher than that of the ground - based position .",
    "this leads to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , for the predictions of positions at epochs which are not near to @xmath37 , the accuracy of @xmath21 governs the accuracy of the predicted position .",
    "hence the improved accuracy of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath38 is very important for such a prediction of positions .    we should mention that our averaging method has also an interesting ` inverse ' application",
    ": if we know the combined catalogue @xmath10 and one of the two underlying catalogues , we can derive back the second underlying catalogue .",
    "we have carried out this ` decomposition of a combined catalogue ' for the fundamental catalogues fk5 , fk4 , and fk3 . in these cases ,",
    "the catalogue containing the ` old ' observations , e.g. the fk3 in the case of fk4 , is published and hence easily available .",
    "in contrast , the summary of the ` new ' observations ( in our example those between the closing dates of fk3 and fk4 ) is not documented and hence unavailable .",
    "one can use the resulting ` pieces ' of the fk5 ( say fk5-fk4 , fk4-fk3 , fk3-nfk , nfk ) for testing the linearity of the motion of a star or for deriving a non - linear motion ( similar to the g solutions of hipparcos ) .",
    "clearly it would be more accurate to use all the hundreds of individual observational catalogues for this purpose .",
    "this is actually our intention for the future , but the decomposition method gives quite rapidly first approximate results .    in the actual combination of a ground - based catalogue with the hipparcos data",
    ", we do not use the simple averaging method described above , but a strict method .",
    "this strict method uses essentially the normal equations of rank 5 ( two positions : @xmath39 ; two proper motions : @xmath40 ; one parallax : p ) , which can be derived from the hipparcos catalogue and the ground - based catalogue .",
    "the strict method allows for correlations between all the astrometric parameters in a catalogue .",
    "at first , it may be astonishing that the ground - based data can influence the resulting parallax .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ground - based data improve directly the proper motion .",
    "the improved proper motion leads then indirectly to an improved value of the parallax from the hipparcos data . in reality",
    ", the correlation between the parallax and the other astrometric parameters is usually so small for the hipparcos data that the improvement of the parallax in the combined catalogue with respect to that derived from hipparcos alone is negligible in most cases .",
    "if the star is not single but indeed an undetected astrometric binary , then the combination method leads to a less accurate parallax .",
    "in such a case the ` instantaneous ' proper motion and position at @xmath37 , not their ` mean ' values , have to be used in deriving the parallax from the satellite observations , as it was correctly done in the hipparcos data reduction procedure .",
    "the method of combining two catalogues described above is strictly valid for truly single stars only , because the method assumes that a star moves linearly in time on a straight line in space .",
    "hence we call the result of the direct use of the combination method the ` single - star mode ' .    in reality , we can form an ensemble of ` apparently single stars ' only .",
    "such an ensemble is usually spoiled by undetected astrometric binaries . in such an ensemble the quasi",
    "- instantaneously measured hipparcos proper motions and positions suffer from ` cosmic errors ' ( wielen 1995b , 1997 ) .",
    "the effect of these errors on the combination of two catalogues can be properly treated by the methods of statistical astrometry .",
    "the amount of the cosmic errors in the hipparcos proper motions has been determined by a comparison with the fk5 and checked partially with the gc ( wielen 1995b , wielen et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "for example , averaged over about 1200 fk5 stars , we obtain a cosmic error in @xmath38 of @xmath41 mas / year , and @xmath42 mas in @xmath43 .",
    "the cosmic error @xmath44 can be calibrated as a function of the stellar distance @xmath45 ( obtained usually from the hipparcos parallaxes ) .",
    "the derived cosmic errors in @xmath38 and @xmath43 are usually larger than the measuring errors @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and are therefore quite significant .",
    "the ` best prediction ' of stellar positions based on a combination of two catalogues affected by cosmic errors can be derived in general by applying the concepts of statistical astrometry ( wielen 1997 ) . at present , we use some simplifying assumptions , because we lack the observational data for determining the set of correlation functions needed for a full treatment .",
    "we assume that the ground - based catalogue ( e.g. the fk5 or the gc ) is a fully time - averaged , mean catalogue , without any cosmic errors left .",
    "this assumption is certainly not strictly valid , but it should give already quite reasonable results .    using the cosmic errors in @xmath38 and @xmath43 ,",
    "we can derive two other types of predictions for the positions of the stars : ( 1 ) the ` long - term prediction mode ' : this prediction should be used for epochs @xmath4 which differ from @xmath48 by more than about 10 years .",
    "we obtain the long - term average mode by replacing @xmath49 by @xmath50 , and @xmath51 by @xmath52 . otherwise ,",
    "the method of combining the two catalogues remains the same .",
    "( 2 ) the ` short - term prediction mode ' : the cosmic errors are now added to the measuring errors of the ` mean ' catalogue , i.e. @xmath53 is replaced by @xmath54 and @xmath55 by @xmath56 , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not changed .",
    "the short - term prediction is valid for epochs which differ from @xmath37 by a few years only . for a smooth transition from the short - term to the long - term prediction",

    "for the combination with the very accurate hipparcos data , old ground - based observations are especially valuable , because they have large epoch differences with respect to @xmath37 and often still a reasonable accuracy .",
    "a carefully compiled catalogue of old observations of more than 30000 stars is the gc ( boss et al .",
    "therefore we have applied our combination method also to the gc .",
    "we call the resulting combined catalogue gc+hip .    in table iii we present the formal error budget of the gc+hip in the single - star mode .",
    "table iv gives the error budget of the gc+hip in the long - term prediction mode .",
    "for the cosmic errors @xmath44 and @xmath59 in the hipparcos proper motions and positions of the gc stars , we use the results determined from the basic fk5 stars .",
    "this is certainly an approximation only : the gc stars are in general fainter in apparent magnitude than the basic fk5 stars ( by about 1.9 magnitudes ) , and they are more distant ( median parallax of gc stars : 6.8 mas , of basic fk5 stars : 11.3 mas ) .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison of @xmath11 of the gc+hip with @xmath38 for gc stars has essentially lead to the same values of @xmath44 and @xmath59 as for the basic fk5 stars ( wielen et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "how important the old observations are , is impressively shown by the combination of the gc data with the hipparcos measurements for 1534 basic fk stars . from a comparison of the last columns of table iii with table",
    "i we see that for these fk stars the combined catalogue gc+hip is only slightly less accurate than the fk6 (= fk5+hip ) itself .",
    "the first columns of table iii give the formal error budget for all the 29717 gc stars which we have identified in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "in the columns in the middle of table iii , we give the results for 11773 ` apparently single ' gc stars .",
    "this ensemble contains only those gc stars which have no special hipparcos solutions in the dmsa , are no ` suspected ' binaries according to hipparcos , do not occur in the ccdm , and have mean errors of @xmath60 and @xmath61 smaller than 2 mas / year .    in the single - star mode ( table iii )",
    ", the rms average for all the gc stars indicates a significant gain by a factor of 2 with respect to hipparcos , while the median shows a smaller improvement ( by 14 percent ) for these stars .",
    "for the 11773 gc stars ( apparently single and with an accurate @xmath11 ) the gain is about 20 percent .",
    "the gain is much higher in the long - term prediction mode ( table iv ) . for the 11773 gc stars , the accuracy in the gc+hip proper motion is by nearly a factor of 2 higher than for the hipparcos proper motion ( if we now include the cosmic error @xmath44 of @xmath38 ) .    in individual comparison of @xmath11 derived from the gc and hipparcos with a typical accuracy of 2 mas / year , with @xmath38 with a measuring error of about 1 mas / year ,",
    "allows us to identify gc stars with large cosmic errors ( say above 6 mas / year ) in their instantaneously measured hipparcos proper motions .",
    "these stars are good candidates for being checked by other observational techniques for their probable binary nature .",
    "known binaries require usually a rather individual treatment in the process of combining ground - based data with the hipparcos measurements .",
    "the main problem is to find a common ` reference point ' for using the method of combination described in section 2 .",
    "such reference points may be the center - of - mass , an instantaneous photo - center , a time - averaged photo - center , the separated components a and b of a double star , etc .",
    "often we have to use statistical methods for ` harmonizing ' the reference points of the ground - based data and of the satellite measurements .",
    "a more detailed description of the problems with double stars is given by wielen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    even after doing the best you can do",
    ", the accuracy of the position and of the proper motion of a binary is often lower by an order of magnitude or more compared to single stars . in order to help the user who is interested in stars of highest astrometric accuracy",
    ", we are flagging in the fk6 and in the gc+hip those stars which behave like well - measured single stars .",

    "the combination of hipparcos measurements with ground - based astrometric data allows us to improve the accuracy of the proper motions of thousands of stars .",
    "improved data for the basic fundamental stars are presented in the fk6 . for many other stars for which the old observations are summarized in the gc , improved data have also been derived .",
