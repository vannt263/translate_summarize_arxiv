    "field - theoretic models with polynomial self - interaction are of growing interest in various areas of modern physics , from cosmology and high energy physics to condensed matter theory @xcite .",
    "in @xmath0-dimensional models of a real scalar field with a high - order polynomial self - interaction potential , there exist topological solutions of the type of kinks , which can possess tails such that either or both decay as power laws towards the asymptotic states connected by the kink @xcite .",
    "properties of kinks with exponential tail asymptotics ( e.g. , such as those arising as solutions to the sine - gordon , @xmath2 or @xmath3 model ) are well - understood @xcite . in particular , we know a lot about kink - antikink interactions in such models .",
    "meanwhile , interactions of kinks with power - law tails have not been studied in such detail .",
    "the study of some properties and interactions of plane domain walls in @xmath4 and @xmath5 dimensional worlds can often be reduced to studying the properties and interactions of kinks in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite .    in this paper , we show that power - law asymptotics lead to long - range interaction between kinks and antikinks  specifically , the force of the interaction can decay slowly , as some negative power of kink - antikink separation .",
    "this is a crucial difference from the ( `` classical '' ) case of kinks with exponential tail asymptotics . in the latter case",
    ", the kink - antikink interaction force always decays exponentially .",
    "consider the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1 model @xcite , given by the lagrangian field density @xmath6 where the potential of self - interaction is @xmath7 as depicted in figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "the potential has three degenerate minima : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 .     model . ]    due to the lorentz invariance of @xmath0-dimensional field theories generated by @xcite , we restrict to static solution without loss of generality .",
    "static solutions , which are called kinks @xcite , interpolate between neighboring degenerate minima of the potential ( vacua states of the model ) .",
    "we use the following notation for kinks : @xmath12 denotes the kink connecting the vacua @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we can also say that this kink belongs to the `` topological sector '' @xmath13 , and similarly for the other kinks of the model .",
    "the @xmath1 model with the potential has two kink solutions , @xmath12 and @xmath14 shown in figures [ fig : kinku ] and [ fig : kinkd ] , respectively , both of which exhibit mixed power - law and exponential tail asymptotics .",
    "to each kink there is also a corresponding antikink .",
    "the kink @xmath12 has power - law asymptotics at @xmath15 , while the kink @xmath14 has power - law asymptotics at @xmath16 .",
    "all kink solutions of the chosen model can easily be obtained in the implicit closed form @xcite : @xmath17 figure [ fig : kinks ] illustrates the two distinct kink solutions .",
    "( the corresponding expressions for antikinks can be obtained from via the transformation @xmath18 . )",
    "standard taylor series expansions reveal that the tail asymptotics of the kinks given by equation are : @xmath19 clearly , the kinks @xmath12 and @xmath14 approach the vacuum state @xmath9 very slowly ( as @xmath20 ) at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively",
    ". meanwhile , the approach to the vacua @xmath8 and @xmath10 is exponential .",
    "consider a static configuration of a kink centered at some point @xmath23 and an antikink centered at @xmath24 .",
    "then , @xmath25 is the half - distance between the kink and the antikink .",
    "our goal is to find how the force of kink - antikink interaction , in the chosen @xmath1 model , depends upon @xmath25 .",
    "here , by the force of interaction we mean the force produced on the kink by the antikink . to estimate this force , we use two methods : the collective coordinate approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein for details ) and manton s method ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein for details ) .      in order to find the interaction force in the case of power - law tails , we assume the following ansatz for the kink - antikink field configuration : @xmath26 as shown in figure [ fig : confd ] . by a standard calculation @xcite , we find that the effective potential @xmath27 and effective force @xmath28 of the interaction are , respectively , @xmath29dx , \\qquad f(\\xi)=\\frac{du_{\\scriptsize\\mbox{eff}}}{d\\xi}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 is the projection of the force onto the @xmath30-axis .",
    "notice that we do not write the minus sign in front of the derivative of the effective potential because we are calculating the force on the left kink .",
    "thus , a positive value of @xmath31 means that the force directed to the left , i.e.  having a negative projection onto the @xmath30-axis .",
    "this corresponds to repulsion between the kink and antikink .",
    "therefore , the second formula in is written such that @xmath32 corresponds to attraction , and @xmath33 corresponds to repulsion .    in figure",
    "[ fig : forcepow ] we show the dependence @xmath34 upon @xmath25 for the field configuration .",
    "it is seen that the kink and antikink repel each other , and the force falls off slowly with increasing separation .",
    "let us now consider the following kink - antikink field configuration : @xmath35 which is shown in figure [ fig : confu ] .",
    "again , we seek to determine @xmath28 . in this case , the kink and antikink are turned to each other by the exponential tails .",
    "the numerically calculated force of interaction is presented in figure [ fig : forceexp ] . from this figure",
    ", it is seen that the kink and antikink attract , and the force falls off quickly with increasing separation .      within the framework of manton s method @xcite ,",
    "the force on the kink is given by the time derivative of the momentum on the semi - infinite interval @xmath36 .",
    "at large @xmath25 this method allows us to use the tail asymptotics for the kink and antikink , which were given in  , to approximate the integrands in the various integrals with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "specifically , using the tail asymptotics of the kink and the tail asymptotics of the corresponding antikink ( @xmath37 ) , we estimate the force of repulsion for the configuration ( i.e. , the kink and antikink are turned to each other by the power - law tails ) to be @xmath38 in the case that the kink and antikink are turned to each other by their exponential tails , i.e.  the configuration , the force of attraction is estimated to be @xmath39    the predictions of and ( manton s method ) are compared to the corresponding result from , as shown in figure [ fig : forces ] . while in the case of exponential tail asymptotics ( figure [ fig : forceexp ] ) we observe good agreement , the case of power - law tails ( figure [ fig : forcepow ] ) shows considerable disagreement between the two curves .",
    "nevertheless , the force of interaction for the case of power - law tails calculated from the collective coordinate approximation does appear to decay as @xmath25 to a negative integer power close to @xmath40 ( as predicted by ) , however the prefactor is off by orders of magnitude .",
    "we intend to investigate the origin of this discrepancy , and whether it is a fundamental limitation of manton s method , in future work .",
    "within a specific @xmath1 model , we have shown that if a kink and an antikink interact via tails that decay as power - laws , then a long - range interaction appears in the system  the force of the kink - antikink interaction decays much more slowly than in the ( `` usual '' ) case of exponentially decaying tails .    using manton s method @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated the asymptotic dependence of the force of interaction on the half - distance @xmath25 between the kink and antikink . in the case of power - law tails",
    ", the force decays as @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "meanwhile , for the case of exponential tails , this force decays off exponentially as @xmath43 for @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the force between the kink and antikink numerically using the collective coordinate approximation .",
    "the results obtained by both methods are in a good agreement in the case of exponential tails .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy in the case of power - law tails will be investigated in future work .",
    "finally , note that understanding the long - range interactions of topological defects with power - law tails is important because such long - range interactions between kinks and antikinks can have key consequences for the dynamics of domain walls and other similar structures in field - theoretical models with polynomial self - interaction .",
