    "multi - boson interference based on correlated measurements is at the heart of many fundamental phenomena in quantum optics and of numerous applications in quantum information @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite have demonstrated the feasibility of multi - boson experiments based on higher - order correlation measurements well beyond the first two - boson interference experiments @xcite . in particular , a lot of attention in the research community was drawn to the so - called boson sampling problem @xcite , formulated as the task to sample from the probability distribution of finding @xmath0 single input bosons at the output of a passive linear interferometer .",
    "this probability distribution depends on permanents of random complex matrices .",
    "the matrix permanent is defined similarly to the determinant aside from the minus signs appearing in the determinant . however , differently from the determinant , the permanent can not be calculated @xcite or even approximated @xcite in polynomial time by a classical computer ( more precisely these computational problems are in the complexity class # p ) .",
    "it has been argued that this also implies that the boson sampling problem can not be solved efficiently by a classical computer @xcite .",
    "this result has triggered several multi - boson interference experiments @xcite as well as studies of its characterization @xcite .    in its current formulation ,",
    "the boson sampling problem relies only on sampling over all possible subsets of detected output ports regardless of the time and the polarization associated with each detection .",
    "however , thanks to the modern fast detectors and the possibility of producing single photons with arbitrary temporal and spectral properties @xcite time - resolved correlation measurements @xcite are today at hand experimentally .",
    "this has motivated us to introduce the novel problem of multi - boson correlation sampling ( mbcs ) @xcite , which considers the sampling process from the interferometer output probability distribution depending on the output ports where the photons are detected and the corresponding detection times and polarizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : mbcsp ] we give a general description of the mbcs problem for correlation measurements of arbitrary order @xmath0 in a @xmath1-port interferometer including the case of photon bunching at the detectors . in section  [ sec : mbcsrates ] , we then analyze the multi - photon indistinguishability at the detectors in the context of time- and polarization - resolved detections . in the limit @xmath2 where no bunching occurs",
    ", we discuss the degree of multi - photon correlation interference for different scenarios of multi - photon distinguishability in section  [ sec : mbcp11 ] .    in section  [ sec : integrated ]",
    ", we describe the case of detectors averaging over the detection times and polarizations .",
    "we consider again the limit @xmath3 in section  [ sec : integrated1 ] and show in section [ sec : bsp ] that , for identical input photons , this scenario corresponds to the description of the well known boson sampling problem .",

    "this highlights the fact that the observation of interference does not require the particles to be identical but only requires them to `` appear identical '' in a given correlation measurement .",
    "however , the visibility of the @xmath0-photon interference , which occurs independently of the photon colors in multi - photon correlation measurements ( see fig .

    "in contrast , by classically averaging over the detection times and polarizations as in the standard boson sampling problem , the information about such full @xmath0-photon interference and its inherent computational power is lost ( see eq . ) . here , while the mbcs problem is classically intractable , the corresponding boson sampling problem becomes trivial @xcite .",
    "the extension of the analysis of the approximate mbcs problem to photons with arbitrary temporal distributions at the detectors will be addressed in a further publication .    in conclusion ,",
