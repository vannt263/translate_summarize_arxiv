    "<S> a transparent material exhibits ultra - fast optical nonlinearity and is subject to optical pressure if irradiated by a laser beam . however , the effect of nonlinearity on optical pressure is often overlooked , even if a nonlinear optical pressure may be potentially employed in many applications , as optical manipulation , biophysics , cavity optomechanics , quantum optics , optical tractors , and is relevant in fundamental problems as the abraham - minkoswky dilemma , or the casimir effect . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that an ultra - fast nonlinear polarization gives indeed a contribution to the optical pressure that also is negative in certain spectral ranges ; the theoretical analysis is confirmed by first - principles simulations . </S>",
    "<S> an order of magnitude estimate shows that the effect can be observable by measuring the deflection of a membrane made by graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical effect of light has been the subject of the investigations of many scientists for more than three centuries , as recently reviewed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> foundational works have driven the emergence of fields of research , as , for example , optical tweezing and laser cooling @xcite , quantum noise in interferometers @xcite , and cavity optomechanics @xcite . even if many aspects of opto - mechanical forces have been largely investigated , there are still several open problems , including , among others , the effect of the optical nonlinearity on the laser induced pressure . as shown in recent papers @xcite , opto - mechanical deformations may produce huge optical nonlinearities , but if the opposite also holds true is at the moment unknown .    when considering a possible effect of an intensity dependent refractive index on the optical pressure , it is important to consider the issue of the form of the momentum of a photon in a dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the related debate has characterized the literature on optomechanical effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the abraham or the minkoswky expressions of the photon momentum are to be chosen depending on the distinction between the canonical ( i.e. , the generator of translations ) and the kinetic momentum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even if in the absence of resonant light - matter interaction , it is accepted that the abraham form is the correct one , one may question what is the role of the always - present ultra - fast optical nonlinearity of electronic origin and , specifically , of an intensity - dependent refractive index . </S>",
    "<S> the very same use of the maxwell stress tensor , and the expression of the abraham force may also be questioned in the presence of nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important issue in several fields , including , among others , optical manipulation @xcite , cavity optomechanics @xcite , biophysics @xcite , quantum optics @xcite , optomechanics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the balazs block ( bb ) furnishes a simple way for understanding the origin of the optical pressure@xcite : a cubic piece of transparent matter obeying the newton law in the absence of friction is irradiated by an electromagnetic ( em ) wave ( see fig.[figurenum0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as a photon travels through the block , it is slowed down , and the block is displaced in the direction of light propagation . </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that the kinetic momentum of a photon is @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the refractive index , @xmath2 the vacuum light velocity , @xmath3 the angular frequency , and @xmath4 the reduced planck constant , consider a photon that travels in vacuum , enters the block , and after some propagation exits again in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> as the initial momentum for the photon is equal to the final one , the final bb velocity is zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the momentum of the photon inside the bb ( @xmath5 ) is smaller than in vacuum ( @xmath6 ) , during the passage of the photon the block moves to guarantee the momentum conservation , while the center of mass - energy travels at a constant velocity . after the interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the bb is displaced by an amount proportional to its length @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> mechanical forces occur only at the entrance and at the exit of the photon.@xcite albeit this analysis is oversimplified and hides a variety of fundamental problems , and notwithstanding the fact that the bb displacement has never been observed in the experiments , bb gives simple insights on optical pressure , due to forces arising from the interaction of the wave with the block interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the following arguments suggest a possible role of the optical nonlinearity .    </S>",
    "<S> given the _ linear _ </S>",
    "<S> refractive index @xmath8 at the wavelength @xmath9 , the photon velocity is @xmath10 , i.e. , the momentum divided by the `` mass '' @xmath11 obtained by the einstein relation @xmath12 . in the presence of an instantaneous nonlinear effect , the refractive index is @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the time - dependent intensity and @xmath15 the kerr coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> as the number of photons increases ( @xmath16 increases ) , the velocity of the photons in the block assumes the lower value @xmath17 ; correspondingly , the bb momentum must increase , and a nonlinear contribution to the forces acting on the bb interfaces is be expected . </S>",
    "<S> this may also be understood by noticing that the time - averaged optical force is determined by the optical transmission , which is indeed affected by the nonlinearity . for a single layer of transparent dielectric matter with length @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the power - dependent nonlinear phase shift alters the linear transmission due the fabry - perot effect and , correspondingly , the optical force .    in the following these arguments </S>",
    "<S> will be validated by a theoretical analysis , and by fully vectorial , four - dimensional , first - principles simulations of the nonlinear maxwell equations . </S>",
    "<S> we show below that the optical pressure is a quadratic function of the intensity because of nonlinearity , and that , in specific frequency intervals , the nonlinear contribution to the pressure is negative . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for a reflection - less structure , a novel kind of all - optical tractor effect may be observable . </S>",
    "<S> possible experimental tests could be performed with highly nonlinear and mechanically resistant materials as , specifically , graphene@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss in the appendices , the modification of the maxwell stress tensor in the presence of an instantaneous nonlinear response . </S>"
