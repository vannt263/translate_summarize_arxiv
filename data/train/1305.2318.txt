    "in the seventies experimental and theoretical investigations of weak interactions in nuclei suggested the presence of various electromagnetic phenomena , which modify the basic decay processes . in the conventional perturbation treatment of the weak interactions these phenomena are attributed to higher - order terms .",
    "these higher - order terms , accompanying @xmath23 decay and shell - electron capture , are @xcite : ( i ) internal bremsstrahlung ; ( ii ) ionization and excitation of the electron cloud ; ( iii ) internal pair production ( ipp ) .",
    "these higher - order effects are much less intense than the first - order processes ; for example , in the case of the internal bremsstrahlung about one photon is produced per 100 @xmath23 decays , and the internal ionization process only occurs about once per 10@xmath16 decays .",
    "the first estimate of the contribution of the ipp process in the @xmath23 decay was performed by arley and moller @xcite and , independently , by tisza @xcite ; these studies were refined in the following years , and experimentally tested by greenberg and deutsch @xcite .    in 1973",
    "@xcite and in the following years , the ipp process was also investigated in the @xmath1 decay , where this effect could give additional information on the higher - order phenomena accompanying nuclear transformations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a theoretical estimate of the @xmath0 production due to bremsstrahlung @xmath24 emitted by @xmath1 particles in the @xmath2am decay was given : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath0 and @xmath1 activities , respectively .",
    "this estimate was in reasonable agreement with the experimental result , obtained in the same work by investigating double coincidences of the two 511 kev @xmath24 quanta produced by the positron annihilation ; the set - up did not allow the detection of the emitted @xmath0 pairs .",
    "in particular , a source of @xmath2amo@xmath28 ( deposited on top of pt backing and covered with thin au layer ) was mounted between ge(li ) 40 cm@xmath15 and nai(tl ) 80 cm@xmath15 detectors .",
    "the mechanical support of the source was made of a stainless steel backing ( without direct access of @xmath1 s to the stainless steel ) ; pb and v foils were used to stop the emitted @xmath1 particles .",
    "the observation of two 511 kev @xmath24 quanta in coincidence between the ge(li ) and nai(tl ) gave for the probability of the @xmath0 emission the value : @xmath30 .",
    "the authors excluded ( or took into account ) various background processes which could imitate the observation , such as : i ) @xmath0 pair creation by cosmic rays and high energy @xmath24 s from natural radioactivity ; ii ) high energy external bremsstrahlung from @xmath1 s ; iii ) ( @xmath1,n ) , ( @xmath1,p ) reactions on pt , pb , v , o ; iv ) excitation of high energy nuclear levels in ( @xmath1,@xmath1 ) scattering ; v ) presence of @xmath31zn and other long lived @xmath32 emitters ; vi ) decay of @xmath2am to high energy levels of @xmath33np .    in 1978",
    "the theoretical value of the probability of the process in @xmath2am was re - estimated to be @xcite : @xmath34 .",
    "further theoretical studies have also been carried out ; in fact , while the theory of the ipp in the @xmath23 decay seemed to be clear , in the @xmath1 decay it required more attention @xcite .",
    "essentially two modes have been suggested for the ipp process in @xmath1 decay : ( i ) the @xmath1 particles are accelerated in the coulomb field of the daughter nucleus and emit bremsstrahlung @xmath24 s , with energy above @xmath35 , giving rise to @xmath0 pairs ; ( ii ) the daughter nucleus originates in an excited state , and the resulting @xmath24 quantum ( real or virtual ) is converted to a @xmath0 pair .",
    "both processes are possible , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the process ( i ) proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite gives a theoretical estimate value for this process was estimated to be @xmath36 , but @xcite has shown that this value was incorrect because it did nt take into account the full transition energy of the @xmath1 particles . ] @xmath37 ( as forementioned ) , whereas the process ( ii ) discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , according to ref .",
    "@xcite the dominant contribution to the ipp in the @xmath1 decay of @xmath2am arises from the mode ( i ) .    in 1986",
    "a new dedicated experiment @xcite was performed in order to investigate the result of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this experiment , three @xmath1 emitters were studied : @xmath39po , @xmath40pu , @xmath2am .",
    "pb and cu absorbers were used to stop @xmath1 and @xmath32 particles ; the 511 kev double coincidences between a ge(li ) 70 cm@xmath15 and a nai(tl ) 785 cm@xmath15 detectors , placed in a low background shield , were observed .",
    "for all the sources , the process was observed with probabilities : @xmath41po@xmath42 , @xmath43pu@xmath44 , @xmath45am@xmath46 , respectively .",
    "pollution of the @xmath2am source by @xmath47eu and @xmath48eu , and pollution of the @xmath40pu by @xmath2am , @xmath49pa , @xmath50bi , @xmath51tl , @xmath52cs were measured , while in the @xmath39po source radioactive impurities were not identified .",
    "moreover , any @xmath1 decay of @xmath2am to the high energy ( @xmath53 kev ) excited states of @xmath33np was excluded ( intensity @xmath54 ) .",
    "the obtained results were in agreement with the refined theoretical expectations of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , and in particular the previous positive result @xcite on @xmath2am was confirmed .",
    "[ tab1 ]    in the late eighties , some anomalous phenomena were observed in collision of heavy ions at gsi and in collision of heavy ions with @xmath55 @xcite , and it was suggested the possible existence of an hypothetical neutral @xmath56 particle , whose decay in @xmath0 pair may give rise to the observed peaks in the measured @xmath55 and @xmath57 spectra .",
    "in particular , in ref . @xcite it was proposed a new model where the pair production would be due to a qed strong coupling phase :",
    "heavy nuclei have a surface region with a strong static electric field that can be perturbed by the passage of charged particles ( e.g. @xmath23 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the perturbation causes a fluctuation in the electric field , that would produce a strong non - static electromagnetic field which may be source of strong coupling vacuum ; the vacuum bubbles can decay in positronium states , which are @xmath0 bound states . in ref .",
    "@xcite some experimental tests were suggested for this model ; one of them is the search for double coincidence events produced by positron annihilation .",
    "thus , in this scenario the production of positronium states in @xmath1 decay of heavy nuclei may be a concurrent process with respect to the ipp one .",
    "however , since the ipp process is better stated , in the following we will mainly refer the results to it .    in",
    "1990 an experiment was performed @xcite with the aim to test the model of ref . @xcite .",
    "two thin plastic scintillators registered @xmath0 pairs emitted from an @xmath2am source , and two ge detectors of 198 cm@xmath15 each registered two 511 kev @xmath24 quanta .",
    "the @xmath2am source was sandwiched by a pair of 10 @xmath58 m ti foils followed by two aluminized mylar foils of 30 @xmath58 m ; two plastic scintillators were placed after them . during 541.7 h live time , the coicidences between @xmath59 511 kev events in the two ge detectors were 466 , most of them were explained as due to background from @xmath32 decay of @xmath60al produced by @xmath61na(@xmath1,n)@xmath60al from sodium contamination ; the presence of sodium in the vicinity of @xmath2am source was also confirmed by the observation of the @xmath24 lines at 1809 and 1130 kev emitted by the @xmath62mg@xmath63 produced in the process : @xmath61na(@xmath1,p)@xmath62mg@xmath63 . when requiring energy releases in two plastics : @xmath64 and @xmath65 greater than 30 kev , just 6 coincidences survive .",
    "finally , only one event remains when the last requirement @xmath66  as expected by the model of ref .",
    "@xcite  is adopted ; hence , an upper limit on the probability of the production of a hypothetical neutral particle with mass above 1.4 mev / c@xmath14 decaying in @xmath0 , was set : @xmath67 ( 95% confidence level , c.l . ) .",
    "the previous experimental results regarding the ipp process @xcite ( and also the theoretical estimates ) were missed in this work . however , in case the ipp process is instead considered , the requirement @xmath66 should be released , and thus the useful number of 511 kev double coincidences from ref .",
    "@xcite is 6 events ; considering this fact , one can derive a @xmath5 value : @xmath68 , compatible with previous observations",
    ". it should be , however , noted that  since the efficiency in @xcite was calculated by simulating the @xmath56 decay with mass of @xmath69 1.4 mev  the derived value of @xmath5 has to be considered approximate .",
    "thus , considering the present situation ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , a new search for @xmath0 pairs in the @xmath2am @xmath1 decay has been carried out deep underground .",
    "the obtained results are described in the following .",
    "the results presented in the following have been obtained through dedicated measurements with some pairs of the nai(tl ) detectors of the dama / libra set - up @xcite , whose description , radiopurity and main features are discussed in details in refs .",
    "we just recall that the sensitive part of this set - up is made of 25 highly radiopure nai(tl ) crystal scintillators ( 5-rows by 5-columns matrix ) ; each nai(tl ) detector has 9.70 kg mass and a size of ( @xmath70 ) @xmath71 .",
    "the bare crystals are enveloped in tetratec - teflon foils and encapsulated in radiopure ofhc cu housings . in each detector two",
    "10 cm long special quartz light guides also act as optical windows on the two end faces of the crystal and are coupled to two low background photomultipliers working in coincidence at single photoelectron threshold .",
    "the data taking considered here has been performed in the new dama / libra configuration after the upgrading occurred in fall 2010 when all the pmts were replaced by new ones with higher quantum efficiency , specially developed by hamamatsu ; details can be found in ref .",
    "the light response in this experimental configuration is typically 610 ph.e./kev depending on the detector .",
    "the detectors are housed in a sealed low radioactivity copper box installed in the center of a low radioactivity cu / pb / cd - foils / polyethylene / paraffin shield ; moreover , about 1 m concrete ( made from the gran sasso rock material ) almost fully surrounds ( mostly outside the barrack ) this passive shield , acting as a further neutron moderator .",
    "the copper box is maintained in hp nitrogen atmosphere in slightly overpressure with respect to the external environment ; it is part of the threefold - level sealing system which excludes the detectors from environmental air . for more details",
    "see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the particular measurements dedicated to the present study an @xmath2am source was placed in the middle of each used nai(tl ) pair for a total of 6 sources used .",
    "the sources have been produced by cea - damri ( nowadays called cerca - lea ) and are identified as am241-egsa15 .",
    "these sources are made of a thin circular layer of active amo@xmath28 ( @xmath72 3 mm ) heat sealed by two thin mylar foils .",
    "they have been stored deep underground for @xmath73 10 yr ; their present mean activity is @xmath74 35 kbq",
    ".    the detailed decay scheme of @xmath2am can be found in ref .",
    "the energy spectrum measured by the dama / libra detectors , when irradiated by the @xmath2am sources , has been accurately reproduced by a suitable montecarlo simulation , which takes into account the decay scheme of @xmath2am @xcite and the activities of the sources .",
    "it is worth noting that about 99.91% of the @xmath2am total rate is due to events below 90 kev .",
    "thus , in order to reduce the acquisition dead - time in our measurements the energy threshold for each detector has been set at @xmath7590 kev to exclude most of the events from the @xmath2am which are out of the region of interest for the present investigation .",
    "the accuracy of the montecarlo simulation allows us to be confident with the standard procedures used for the determination of the data acquisition live time .",
    "the electronic chain was modified with respect to the usual one @xcite by excluding the 500 @xmath58s blocking time and by using either twelve detectors ( six pairs ) in the first running period or six detectors ( three pairs ) in the second one .",
    "an improvement of a factor @xmath76 has been achieved as regards the ratio of the live time over elapsed one in the second dedicated run , where just three pairs have been used ( those with the lower number of coincidences in the first run ) .    in both running periods",
    "each pair has the detectors of the other used pairs as anti - coincidences ; this implies two different coincidence backgrounds for a same pair in the two different running periods ( see tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "finally , the energies of the acquired events were read out from the adcs ( see e.g. ref .",

    "* in the decay chain @xmath2am @xmath134bi , the contribution of high energy @xmath24 s ( with energies larger than 1.022 mev , that is able to produce @xmath0 pairs ) is negligible . in particular , from the best fit values of the @xmath2am and @xmath99pa activities given above , one can obtain for the daughters activities : 208 mbq for @xmath33np , 8.1 @xmath58bq for @xmath99u and 4.6 nbq for @xmath135th and its daughters . taking into account these activities and safely assuming that each @xmath24 is converted in a @xmath0 pair , the contribution to @xmath5 from high energy @xmath24 s in the @xmath2am decay chain can be estimated as in the following : i ) 1110 kev @xmath24 in @xmath99u decay @xcite can provide @xmath136 ; ii ) @xmath24 lines at 1046 , 1100 , 1119 and 1328 kev in @xmath137bi decay @xcite can provide @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively ; iii ) @xmath24 lines at 1239 and 1567 kev in @xmath142tl decay @xcite can provide @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively . * no @xmath1 decay of @xmath2am to an excited level of @xmath33np with energy larger than 0.8 mev has been observed to our knowledge and in the decay scheme of @xmath2am @xcite . ] .",
    "thus , no direct contribution from the @xmath2am decay scheme @xcite to double coincidences in the energy windows of interest is expected .",
    "remaining possible side processes are discussed in the following .",
    "we recall that the used sources are made of a thin layer of active amo@xmath28 ( @xmath72 3 mm ) heat sealed by two thin mylar foils , and have been stored underground for @xmath73 10 yr .    thus , the elements that can give rise to ( @xmath1,n ) or to ( @xmath1,p ) reactions are the stable or long - lived isotopes of c , o ( that are present in the source materials ) and , if @xmath1 particles may survive to the mylar foils , also n ( gas surrounding the sources when they are inserted in the set - up ) and cu ( housing of the nai(tl ) detectors ) .    considering the energy of the @xmath1 particles emitted by the @xmath2am , the possible ( @xmath1,n )",
    "reactions are : @xmath146c(@xmath1,n)@xmath147o , @xmath148o(@xmath1,n)@xmath149ne , @xmath150o(@xmath1,n)@xmath151ne ; none of the produced isotopes is a @xmath152 emitter . on the other hand ,",
    "possible ( @xmath1,n ) reactions on ne produced by the o isotopes ( @xmath1,n ) reactions : @xmath149ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath61 mg , can give @xmath32 emission but the energy threshold is 8.7 mev , that is higher than the energy of the @xmath1 particles emitted by @xmath2am .",
    "moreover , considering the energy threshold , the only possible ( @xmath1,p ) reactions are : @xmath153n(@xmath1,p)@xmath148o and @xmath154n(@xmath1,p)@xmath150o , both giving stable isotopes of o , and @xmath155cu(@xmath1,p)@xmath156zn and @xmath31cu(@xmath1,p)@xmath157zn both giving stable isotopes of zn .    a further source of background could be due to @xmath0 pairs produced by photons from ( @xmath1,n@xmath24 ) and ( @xmath1,@xmath24 ) reactions on the stable nuclei of c and o ; considering the measured cross sections @xcite , a cautious upper limit on this contribution can be derived : @xmath158 .    in conclusion , possible significant contribution of @xmath32 emitters and of high energy @xmath24 s from @xmath1 interactions on known materials can be excluded ; a similar study was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite where such possibilities were also excluded .",
    "the spontaneous fission of @xmath2am has been measured in several works ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) and the recommended lifetime is : @xmath159 yr . considering that the spontaneous fission activity is given by : @xmath160 , and that not all the fission fragments give rise to @xmath0 emission , an upper limit : @xmath161 can be derived .",
    "thus , the spontaneous fission can be excluded as source of the observed coincidence excess .",
    "another possibility may be the induced fission . from experimental studies @xcite the more probable fragments masses in case of @xmath2am fission induced by thermal neutrons ( the one with higher cross section ) are about 135 and 105 . various nuclei with an excess of neutrons can be created with a cumulative yield up to 7% , high @xmath162 values ( up to 8 mev ) and small @xmath163 s @xcite . in their decay ,",
    "deexcitations @xmath24 s with high energies can be converted into @xmath0 pairs and imitate the observed effect .",
    "thus , let us estimate the probability to have a fission from neutrons in the experimental conditions .",
    "the environmental flux of thermal neutrons inside the used multi - ton multi - component shield cm@xmath108s@xmath165 @xcite , and the adopted neutron shield is made of @xmath74 1 m concrete from the same gran sasso rock , 10/40 cm paraffin / polyethylene , 1.5 mm cd .",
    "in addition , there are 10 cm of ofhc cu and 15 cm of pb @xcite .",
    "] has been measured to be : @xmath166 cm@xmath108s@xmath165 ( 90% c.l . ) @xcite ; the maximum cross - section for neutrons is @xmath7440 barn @xcite , and the @xmath2am nuclei in a source are about @xmath167 . from these quantities",
    "a fission rate from environmental thermal neutrons surviving the shield can be derived to be : @xmath168 s@xmath165 ; on the other hand , neutrons produced in this possible fission process have a very low probability to induce further fissions ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "thus this process is too inefficient to account for the observations .",
    "in addition to the environmental flux , neutrons can also be produced in the ( @xmath1,n ) reaction on o isotopes ; in particular , @xmath148o and @xmath150o which are in the mylar and in the amo@xmath28 with a total concentration of @xmath170 cm@xmath108 .",
    "however , considering a mean source activity of 35 kbq and a mean cross section for the process of 0.2 barn for @xmath148o ( natural abundance @xmath171% ) and 0.5 barn for @xmath150o ( @xmath172% ) @xcite , a neutron production rate : @xmath173 s@xmath165 , is derived with a neutron mean energy of order of mev .",
    "the expected fission rate from these neutrons ( @xmath174 barn @xcite ) is of order of @xmath175 s@xmath165 .",
    "thus , in conclusion also this fission process is too inefficient to explain the observed excess .    finally , another possible process is the clusters decay of @xmath2am .",
    "the emission of @xmath176si is considered as the most probable one in the cluster decay of the @xmath2am : @xmath2am @xmath177 @xmath176si + @xmath178tl , with theoretical half lives : @xmath179 yr @xcite and @xmath180 yr @xcite .",
    "both the created fragments are unstable . in the decay of @xmath178tl , only the ground state and few excited levels of @xmath178pb with @xmath181 kev",
    "are populated ; their deexcitation can not produce @xmath0 pairs .",
    "however , in the decay chain @xmath176si ( @xmath182 s , @xmath183 kev ) @xmath177 @xmath176p ( @xmath184 s , @xmath185 kev ) @xmath177 @xmath176s",
    "@xcite much more energy is released , and the deexcitation of high energy levels in @xmath176p and @xmath176s leads to emission of @xmath0 pairs . the best current experimental limit on the decay : @xmath2am @xmath177 @xmath176si + @xmath178tl , is @xmath186 yr @xcite ; the limit for other clusters emission is @xmath187 yr @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the possible contribution of @xmath2am cluster decay is negligible ( @xmath188 ) and can not account for the observed effect .",
    "the experimental data show an excess of double coincidences in the 511511 kev energy region which are not explained by known analysed background processes as discussed above .",
    "moreover , any sizeable contamination of the sources themselves by isotopes @xmath32 emitters is not present to our knowledge .",
    "thus , this measured excess gives a a relative activity @xmath3 for the internal pair production ( ipp ) with respect to alpha decay of @xmath2am ; this value is of the same order of magnitude as the previous determinations @xcite obtained by using different setups , sources ( with different features and producers ) and experimental approaches . in a conservative approach the upper limit @xmath4 ( 90% c.l . ) can be derived .    for completeness , we mention that , if one considers the exotic frame hypothesized in ref",
    ". @xcite , one would get @xmath5 value or @xmath5 limit of the same order of magnitude as those given above .",
    "further investigations are foreseen in the future with different dedicated sources and set - up .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that this is the first result on ipp obtained in an underground experiment ( in the previous ones the sea - level cosmic - rays background was estimated and subtracted ) , and that the @xmath5 value obtained in the present work is independent on the live - time estimate ( which is difficult to estimate with very high accuracy in similar experiments because of the relatively high intensities of the @xmath2am sources ) .",
    "in order to estimate a possible presence of a coincidence excess in the region of interest in runs with presence of @xmath2am sources with respect to runs without sources , the following procedure has been adopted .",
    "let us consider that @xmath82 is the number of coincidence events measured in the region of interest in presence of the source during a live time @xmath85 .",
    "the conditional probability to measure @xmath82 coincidence events in presence of a signal @xmath189 ( @xmath84 is the signal rate , see text ) and of a background rate @xmath190 is given by : @xmath191    the @xmath190 parameter can be estimated by performing a run in absence of sources , where @xmath83 coincidence events are collected in a live time @xmath86 .",
    "in fact , the conditional probability to obtain @xmath83 given a background rate @xmath190 is : @xmath192 to determine the probability distribution function ( @xmath193 ) of @xmath194 , @xmath195 , the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite can be followed . if the _",
    "prior _ probability of @xmath190 is a uniform function in @xmath196 , the _ posterior _ @xmath193  given @xmath83  can be written by using the bayes theorem : @xmath197 while the _ posterior _",
    "@xmath193 for @xmath194  given @xmath82 and the @xmath190 parameter  is : @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are normalization constants .",
    "since @xmath190 is a nuisance parameter , one can marginalize with respect to it obtaining : @xmath201 where @xmath77 is a normalization constant such that @xmath202      finally , according to the wilks theorem , the quantity @xmath206 follows a @xmath207 distribution @xcite ; thus to obtain the best estimate for @xmath194 and its interval of confidence , the same procedure used for the @xmath207 distribution can be followed ."
