    "the short duty cycle acounts for the fact that bright quasars are much less abundant than their host galaxies , but it begs the more fundamental question : _ why is the quasar activity so brief ? _",
    "a natural explanation is that quasars are suicidal , namely the energy output from the bhs regulates their own growth .",
    "supermassive bhs make up a small fraction , @xmath3 , of the total mass in their host galaxies , and so their direct dynamical impact is limited to the central star distribution where their gravitational influence dominates .",
    "dynamical friction on the background stars keeps the bh close to the center .",
    "random fluctuations in the distribution of stars induces a brownian motion of the bh .",
    "this motion can be decribed by the same langevin equation that captures the motion of a massive dust particle as it responds to random kicks from the much lighter molecules of air around it @xcite .",
    "the characteristic speed by which the bh wanders around the center is small , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the masses of a single star and the bh , respectively , and @xmath7 is the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "since the random force fluctuates on a dynamical time , the bh wanders across a region that is smaller by a factor of @xmath8 than the region traversed by the stars inducing the fluctuating force on it .",
    "the dynamical insignificance of the bh on the global galactic scale is misleading .",
    "the gravitational binding energy per rest - mass energy of galaxies is of order @xmath9 .",
    "since bh are relativistic objects , the gravitational binding energy of material that feeds them amounts to a substantial fraction its rest mass energy .",
    "even if the bh mass occupies a fraction as small as @xmath10 of the baryonic mass in a galaxy , and only a percent of the accreted rest - mass energy leaks into the gaseous environment of the bh , this slight leakage can unbind the entire gas reservoir of the host galaxy ! this order - of - magnitude estimate explains why quasars are short lived .",
    "as soon as the central bh accretes large quantities of gas so as to significantly increase its mass , it releases large amounts of energy that would suppress further accretion onto it . in short",
    ", the bh growth is _ self - regulated_.    the principle of _ self - regulation _ naturally leads to a correlation between the final bh mass , @xmath11 , and the depth of the gravitational potential well to which the surrounding gas is confined , @xmath12 .",

    "the observed power - law relation between @xmath11 and @xmath7 can be generalized to a correlation between the bh mass and the circular velocity of the host halo , @xmath13 @xcite , which in turn can be related to the halo mass , @xmath14 , and redshift , @xmath15 @xcite @xmath16^\\frac{5}{6}(1+z)^\\frac{5}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a constant , @xmath18 is close to unity and defined as @xmath19 $ ] , @xmath20^{-1}$ ] , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( see equations  2225 in ref .",

    "various prescriptions for self - regulation were sketched by silk & rees @xcite .",
    "these involve either energy or momentum - driven winds , where the latter type is a factor of @xmath34  less efficient @xcite .",
    "wyithe & loeb @xcite demonstrated that a particularly simple prescription for an energy - driven wind can reproduce the luminosity function of quasars out to highest measured redshift , @xmath35 ( see figs .

    "it is remarkable that the combination of the above simple prescription and the standard @xmath38cdm cosmology for the evolution and merger rate of galaxy halos , lead to a satisfactory agreement with the rich data set on quasar evolution over cosmic history .",
    "the cooling time of the heated gas is typically longer than its dynamical time and so the gas should expand into the galactic halo and escape the galaxy if its initial temperature exceeds the virial temperature of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the quasar remains active during the dynamical time of the initial gas reservoir , @xmath39 years , and fades afterwards due to the dilution of this reservoir .",

    "it is therefore not surprising that quasar and starburst activities co - exist in ultra luminous infrared galaxies @xcite , and that all quasars show broad metal lines indicating a super - solar metallicity of the surrounding gas @xcite . applying a similar self - regulation principle to the stars ,",
    "leads to the expectation @xcite that the ratio between the mass of the bh and the mass in stars is independent of halo mass ( as observed locally @xcite ) but increases with redshift as @xmath44 . a consistent trend has indeed been inferred in an observed sample of gravitationally - lensed quasars @xcite .    .",

    "the quasar energy output may have led to the extinction of cold gas in these galaxies and the suppression of further star formation in them , leading to an apparent `` anti - hierarchical '' mode of galaxy formation where massive spheroids formed early and did not make new stars at late times .",
    "in the course of subsequent merger events , the cores of the most massive spheroids acquired an envelope of collisionless matter in the form of already - formed stars or dark matter @xcite , without the proportional accretion of cold gas into the central bh .",
