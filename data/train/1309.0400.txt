    "the bohmian formulation of non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) @xcite is the best known and most successful hidden - variable formulation of quantum theory @xcite . however , the explicit nonlocality of the theory causes difficulties in attempts to reconcile it with the theory of relativity .",
    "in fact , contrary to a wide belief , it is not so difficult to write down nonlocal relativistic - covariant equations for particle trajectories , without introducing any preferred foliation of spacetime @xcite .",
    "the problems are ( i ) to make unambiguous probabilistic predictions resulting from such a theory , and ( ii ) to show that they are compatible with the probabilistic predictions of standard qm . in the simplest case of a single relativistic particle without spin",
    ", the problem can be reduced to the fact that the bohmian 3-velocity @xmath0 does _ not _ obey a space - equivariance equation of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the wave function , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the summation over repeated index @xmath6 is understood .",
    "the violation of ( [ e1 ] ) implies that @xmath7 can not be the probability density @xmath8 that the particle will have the position @xmath9 at time @xmath10 .    as a reaction to this problem",
    ", it has been suggested several times @xcite that ( [ e1 ] ) should be replaced by a manifestly covariant spacetime - equivariance equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spacetime vector index and @xmath13 is a scalar parameter used to parameterize particle trajectories @xmath14 with velocities @xmath15 the spacetime - equivariance equation provides the consistency of the spacetime probability density @xmath16 , where the sum of all probabilities is @xmath17    however , the covariant approach based on ( [ e2])-([e4 ] ) leads to several conceptual difficulties .",
    "standard qm is interpreted in terms of space probability density , so how can it be compatible with the spacetime probability density ?",
    "is nt the left - hand side of ( [ e4 ] ) actually infinite ?",
    "if , as the concept of spacetime probability suggests , @xmath18 may be uncertain , then why in physics time @xmath10 can usually be viewed as certain ? what is the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath13 ? how the measurable probabilistic predictions of standard qm can be reproduced from the spacetime probability density ?",
    "the results in the literature provide only partial answers to these questions ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . the main goal of the present paper is to give a more thorough answer to these and other related questions .      to understand the main idea , let us first reformulate the problem as follows .",
    "suppose that one wants to interpret @xmath19 as probability density conserved in time .",
    "but the theory of relativity asserts that the time coordinate is not unique .",
    "so the question is : _ which _ time ?    in the standard copenhagen interpretation of qm ,",
    "one is inclined to say that time is simply the time of the observer who attributes the probabilistic interpretation to @xmath19 .",
    "but the observer in copenhagen interpretation is an _",
    "observer , not himself described by qm . on the other hand , one of the goals of bohmian mechanics is precisely to remove the external observer from the theory .",
    "so how to specify time without referring to an external observer ?",
    "one possibility is to introduce a preferred foliation of spacetime , which defines time in terms of spacelike hypersurfaces of constant time . to make it relativistic in spirit ,",
    "the foliation may not be given _ a priori _ , but somehow determined dynamically from the wave function @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the existing concrete proposals of that kind do not seem very satisfying .",
    "so , can time be specified without preferred foliation and without an external observer ?",
    "now our central conceptual idea is the following .",
    "bohmian mechanics is a fundamentally deterministic theory , so any probabilistic aspect of it must necessarily be associated with a lack of knowledge .",
    "therefore , there must be a subject which lacks this knowledge .",
    "but there should not be any external subject , so the only remaining possibility is an _",
    "internal _ subject .",
    "in other words , the probability must be associated with knowledge available ( or unavailable ) _ to the particles themselves_. ( a human observer is just a special case , as humans , after all , are also made of particles . ) therefore , _ the physical time with respect to which the probability is conserved must be the time experienced by the particles_.    this simple but crucial idea represents the core idea on which this paper is based .",
    "in particular , in classical relativistic mechanics it leads immediately to the result that probability must be conserved with respect to the _ proper time _ associated with particle trajectories .",
    "we shall see that this also explains why @xmath18 may not be certain in the relativistic case , while it must be certain in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "however , it will turn out that the identification of @xmath13 with proper time along particle trajectories is more subtle than it may seem at the first sight .",
    "the classical proper time @xmath20 along a particle trajectory is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the minkowski metric , and we work in units in which the velocity of light is @xmath23 .",
    "this relation is completely local , in the sense that proper time experienced by some particle does not depend on the motion of other particles . in the quantum case",
    "it will turn out that ( [ e5 ] ) must be modified with a nonlocal expression .",
    "if we have @xmath24 particles with trajectories @xmath25 , @xmath26 , then instead of ( [ e5 ] ) we will have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the classical local proper time , and @xmath29 is a nonlocal function determined by the nonlocal many - particle wave function .    at first sight ,",
    "the appearance of a nonlocal scale factor @xmath30 in ( [ e6 ] ) may seem rather puzzling , but in fact it is not completely new .",
    "in @xcite @xmath30 has been proposed to be proportional to @xmath31 . in this paper",
    "we shall use the analogy with classical relativistic mechanics , non - relativistic bohmian mechanics , and even non - relativistic classical mechanics , to motivate a much more natural choice of @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , we shall see that an analogue of ( [ e6 ] ) with a nonlocal function @xmath30 appears even in non - relativistic bohmian mechanics .",
    "this paper is rather long .",
    "the main new results could certainly be exposed in a shorter one .",
    "but the ambition of the present paper is more than that .",
    "we want this paper to be a fully comprehensive pedagogic self - contained exposition of relativistic bohmian mechanics , containing not only the results which are truly new , but also some older , and yet not - widely - known results which , in our opinion , are necessary for thorough understanding . in particular , since the many - time formalism is essential for the relativistic covariant formulation of bohmian mechanics , we want to be sure that readers fully grasp it . for that purpose",
    ", we spend a lot of space to explain in fair detail how the many - time formalism appears in more familiar contexts such as relativistic classical mechanics , non - relativistic quantum mechanics , and even non - relativistic classical mechanics .    for impatient readers who are already familiar with the many - time formalism and with some of the results in @xcite ( but feel that something is still missing there ) ,",
    "the quickest route to grasp the main new results of this paper is as follows .",

    "[ sec2 ] , explained very simply from the technical point of view .",
    "yet , from the conceptual point of view , this section is essential for proper understanding of the rest of paper , so its relevance should not be underestimated .",

    "in particular , the non - relativistic space equivariance generalizes to relativistic spacetime equivariance .",
    "we pay particular attention to explain in detail how , under certain circumstances , a space - equivariance equation can be derived from the more fundamental spacetime equivariance .    in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we finally formulate the main principles of relativistic bohmian mechanics , emphasizing the two fundamental postulates from which everything else can be derived . in particular , we derive the spacetime - equivariance equation and show that , under a widely valid assumption , it can be approximated by a space - equivariance equation .    in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we briefly outline some generalizations of the theory , including particles with spin , influence of classical background fields , and quantum field theory .",
    "we also discuss the case of massless particles and argue that they do not have bohmian trajectories .",
    "[ sec7 ] is devoted to the theory of quantum measurements , which is essential to understand how relativistic bohmian mechanics reproduces the measurable predictions of standard qm .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec8 ] .    in appendix [ seca ]",
    "we discuss how some arguments in the literature against existence of relativistic - covariant versions of bohmian mechanics are circumvented by our theory , and argue that nonlocality of the quantum proper time can not be avoided in a wide class of theories obeying a spacetime - equivariance equation . in appendix [ secb ] we derive some technical results concerning properties of positive - energy wave functions . in appendix [ secc ]",
    "we discuss the difference between macroscopic and microscopic proper time in classical mechanics .",
    "in general , a probabilistic description is used when the values of some variables are not known with certainty .",
    "let there be @xmath32 such unknown variables @xmath33 .",
    "the probability may also depend on some known variables @xmath34 .",
    "for example , in qm",
    "the known variable is usually time , while in statistical physics in thermodynamic equilibrium the known variables include temperature and chemical potential .",
    "but whatever the known and unknown variables are , the probabilistic description always involves the probability density @xmath35 satisfying @xmath36 the known variables @xmath34 are not described probabilistically , which is why ( [ e2.1 ] ) does not involve an integration over @xmath37 . when the only known variable is time , one interprets ( [ e2.1 ] ) by saying that probability is conserved in time . in particular , in standard qm the probability",
    "is conserved in time due to unitarity . in general",
    ", we shall say that ( [ e2.1 ] ) means that the probability is conserved in the variables @xmath34 .",
    "even though @xmath34 are known , formally they can also be treated probabilistically , by using @xmath38-functions .",
    "if the variables @xmath39 are known to have some definite values @xmath40 , then we may introduce the probability density @xmath41 it satisfies @xmath42    the probability depends on available knowledge",
    ". however , different levels of knowledge exist in physics , which means that one can attribute different probabilities to the same variable in the same physical conditions , depending on which level of knowledge one is having in mind . roughly , the main levels of knowledge in physics can be classified as follows :    * level i  _ empirical knowledge _ : the knowledge obtained by measurement .",
    "* level ii  _ theoretical knowledge _ : the knowledge obtained by theory .",
    "it can be further split into two sub - levels : * * level ii.a  _ theoretical knowledge in practice _ : the knowledge determined by equations which are sufficiently simple to solve in practice . for example",
    ", it may be a two - body system in newtonian mechanics . *",
    "* level ii.b  _ theoretical knowledge in principle _ : the knowledge determined in principle by the fundamental deterministic laws , even if in practice the system is too complicated to solve the fundamental equations explicitly . for example",
    ", it may be a chaotic system with many relevant degrees of freedom .    in this paper we shall use all these levels of knowledge , depending on the context .",
    "thus , to avoid confusion , it is useful to have in mind which level of knowledge is used when different probabilities are assigned to a given physical system .",
    "it is also fair to note there is no sharp boundary between the different levels of knowledge above .",
    "in fact , to obtain knowledge , one often combines knowledge obtained from different levels .",
    "for instance , suppose that one wants to measure electric field @xmath43 . to measure it , one actually measures ( level i ) the electric force @xmath44 on the charge @xmath45 , and then calculates ( level ii ) the electric field by the formula @xmath46 .",
    "essentially , this is why einstein famously said that `` it is theory that decides what can be observed '' .      in physics ,",
    "one often takes for granted that time is a known variable , not subject to a probabilistic description . in particular , in qm one often _ requires _ the pure state to have a unitary time evolution , because otherwise the theory does not seem physically acceptable .",
    "but why exactly is that so ? what makes time so special , in a sense more certain than anything else",
    "some may consider it to be intuitively obvious , others may find the question too difficult , and yet others may believe that the question is philosophic rather than physical . in any case , we are not aware of any clear physical explanation available in the literature . in this subsection",
    "we offer a simple physical justification for such a view of time , based exclusively on classical physics .    for that purpose , we consider a simple thought experiment .",
    "consider a space - tourist traveling in a spaceship , sitting in a compartment without windows or any other instruments which could tell him about the world outside of the spaceship .",
    "the spaceship moves with non - relativistic velocities , having some complicated trajectory @xmath47 .",
    "ultimately ( i.e. at level ii.b of knowledge ) the trajectory @xmath47 is determined by some deterministic laws , but at the practical level ( level ii.a ) the trajectory is too complicated for the tourist to calculate it .",
    "what can the tourist know about his position in space and time ?",
    "since the knowledge is not available to him at level ii.a , he must resort to level i , that is , measurement .",
    "but since he has no windows or any other instruments which could tell him about the outside world , he can not determine where he is . in other words , he can not measure @xmath48 .",
    "still , there is something which he _ can _ know without any access to the outside world ; he can determine time @xmath10 by measuring it with his local clock .",
    "this provides a simple reason why time @xmath10 is better known than the space position @xmath48 .",
    "( a nit - picking reader might object that the tourist can also measure his own acceleration , from which he could reproduce the trajectory @xmath47 .",
    "but in general this is not so simple .",
    "first , the change of velocity may , in part , be due to a free falling around massive astrophysical objects , which the local accelerometer can not detect .",
    "second , the spaceship engines may change the spaceship velocity very slowly , below the sensitivity threshold of a realistic accelerometer .",
    "third , the calculation of the trajectory may be too complicated to perform in practice . )    since the actual position @xmath48 of the tourist is not known to him , the best he can do is to assign some probability to any possible position @xmath49 .",
    "but since time is known to him , he will not assign probabilities to different values of @xmath10 .",
    "this means that his probabilistic description will be given by some probability density @xmath8 satisfying @xmath50 essentially , this is why probability is conserved _ in time_.    now consider a variation of the thought experiment , with the only difference that velocities of the spaceship may be relativistic .",
    "now the trajectory of the spaceship is some complicated function @xmath51 , where @xmath20 is the relativistic _ proper time _ measured by the clock in the spaceship .",
    "therefore , in the relativistic case it is the proper time @xmath20 that is known to the tourist , and not the coordinate time @xmath52 .",
    "the function @xmath53 may be too complicated to calculate from first principles .",
    "the time @xmath54 can perhaps be measured by an external clock at rest with respect to the lorentz frame with coordinates @xmath55 , but it can not be measured by the tourist . therefore , at any given @xmath20 , the tourist will assign some probabilities not only to the values of @xmath49 , but also to the values of @xmath18 . in other words ,",
    "his probabilistic description will be given by some probability density @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57 this is the simplest way to understand why , in relativity , one has to use the _ spacetime probability density conserved in proper time _ ( eq .  ( [ e2.5 ] ) ) , and not the space probability density conserved in coordinate time ( eq .  ( [ e2.4 ] ) ) .",
    "as noted in introduction , the difference between space probability density and spacetime probability density is related to a difference between space equivariance ( [ e1 ] ) and spacetime equivariance ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "here we want to understand this difference in the simplest possible case , by using level ii.b knowledge applied to a single classical particle .",
    "consider a non - relativistic particle with a known trajectory @xmath47 .",
    "since the trajectory is known , the probability density @xmath8 is a @xmath38-function @xmath58 this implies @xmath59 here @xmath60 , while @xmath61 is actually @xmath62 , since the right hand side of ( [ e2.6 ] ) is a function of @xmath63 . introducing the notation @xmath4 and noting that @xmath64 depends only on @xmath10 so that @xmath65 , we finally write ( [ e2.7 ] ) as @xmath66 this is nothing but the space - equivariance equation for the probability density ( [ e2.6 ] ) .",
    "now consider a relativistic particle with a known trajectory @xmath51 . instead of ( [ e2.6 ] )",
    ", now we have a spacetime probability density @xmath67 thus , in a completely analogous way , instead of ( [ e2.8 ] ) we obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "( [ e2.10 ] ) is the simplest example of a spacetime - equivariance equation .    to see the relation between space equivariance and spacetime equivariance , it is instructive to see how",
    "the former can be derived from the latter . for that purpose",
    "we first write ( [ e2.9 ] ) as @xmath70 where @xmath71 then , to eliminate @xmath18 from ( [ e2.10 ] ) , we integrate ( [ e2.10 ] ) over @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 we see that the integration of ( [ e2.10 ] ) leads to @xmath74 eqs .",
    "( [ e2.12 ] ) and ( [ e2.14 ] ) are very similar to ( [ e2.6 ] ) and ( [ e2.8 ] ) , respectively .",
    "thus , ( [ e2.14 ] ) represents the relativistic space - equivariance equation , with the relativistic proper time @xmath20 instead of the non - relativistic time @xmath10 in ( [ e2.8 ] ) .",
    "even though ( [ e2.14 ] ) is relativistic , note , however , that it is not manifestly covariant , but valid in one fixed set of coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath49 .",
    "if one transforms it to another set of coordinates , then ( [ e2.14 ] ) transforms into an equation having a different form .",
    "finally , note that in the non - relativistic limit the proper time @xmath20 becomes identical to the non - relativistic time @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in the non - relativistic limit the space - equivariance equation ( [ e2.14 ] ) becomes identical to ( [ e2.8 ] ) .",
    "consider @xmath24 non - relativistic and mutually non - interacting particles , each described by its own hamiltonian @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the particle labels , @xmath77 is the momentum of the particle with position @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the potential for the particle labeled by @xmath80 .",
    "since the @xmath24 systems do not interact with each other , their internal clocks can not be synchronized .",
    "hence it is justified to use a different time variable @xmath81 for each particle trajectory @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the system can be described by @xmath24 hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath83",

    "the usual single - time formulation may be recovered in the following way .",
    "one performs the sum @xmath88 in ( [ e3.2 ] ) to obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91    the next step is to consider the special case in which all time variables @xmath81 have the same value @xmath10 . for that purpose",
    "we use the following identity .",
    "let @xmath92 be an arbitrary function , and let @xmath93 then @xmath94 in this paper , we shall use the many - time identity ( [ identity ] ) many times .    applying the identity ( [ identity ] ) to ( [ e3.5 ] )",

    "this is a manifestation of the fact that classical mechanics is local , which can be traced back to the locality of the classical potential ( [ e3.6 ] ) . in particular , even though all trajectories can be parameterized by the same time variable @xmath10 in ( [ e3.12 ] ) , it does not mean that the theory is not local .",
    "now , instead of a single trajectory @xmath82 , consider a statistical ensemble of such trajectories , with velocities determined by the velocity field ( [ e3.3 ] ) . in the ensemble ,",

    "the number of ensemble particles escaping from @xmath100 per unit time is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the surface element on the boundary and the gauss theorem has been used .",
    "but the particles in the ensemble are neither created nor destroyed .",
    "the number of particles ( per unit time ) that disappeared in @xmath100 must be equal to the number of particles ( per unit time ) that escaped from @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath104 but this must be valid for _ any _ @xmath100 , which leads to the local equation @xmath105 eq .",

    "( [ e3.15 ] ) is also called `` continuity equation '' or `` local conservation equation '' .",
    "the name `` continuity equation '' is perhaps better suited in the context of continuous fluids , while the name `` local conservation equation '' is perhaps better suited to describe the conservation of quantities such as charge , the density @xmath106 of which does not need to be positive .",
    "thus , to avoid confusion , in this paper we use the name `` equivariance equation '' when we refer to a property of probability density @xmath106 associated with a statistical ensemble .    here",
    "@xmath99 is the probability density for a _ single _ particle .",
    "but the label @xmath80 reminds us that we have @xmath24 particles , each described by a separate probability density @xmath107 .",
    "we assume that the particles do not interact with each other ( see ( [ e3.6 ] ) ) , which means that the particles can not be correlated .",

    "if the filled channel is @xmath381 , then one can use the bohmian theory of motion ( at level ii of sec .",
    "2.1 ) to conclude that the measured particle with position @xmath382 will behave as if the initial wave function ( [ e7.1 ] ) collapsed to @xmath379 in ( [ e7.2 ] ) .",
    "for that reason , @xmath379 is referred to as _ effective wave function_.    so far so good .",

    "hence , if we could `` directly perceive '' @xmath382 just as we can @xmath380 , then we could have a direct empirical proof that bohmian particle positions really exist , just as we do have a direct empirical proof that macroscopic pointers really exist .",

    "instead , what we really see is the light that comes to our telescopes , and from this light we make inference about luminous matter .",
    "so what exactly makes the observation of luminous matter more direct than the observation of the dark one ?",
    "the point is that the interaction between light ( which we really see ) and luminous matter ( about which we infer from the light seen ) is _ very localized_. namely , luminous matter influences the behavior of light only at the place of the luminous matter itself .",
    "( a nit - picking reader might object that there is also a not - so - localized interaction based on gravitational lensing , but for most purposes this effect may be neglected . )",
    "thus , from observed light , one can easily and precisely determine the _ position _ of the luminous matter .",

    "luminous matter may be influenced by dark matter positioned very far away from the luminous one , so , by determining the position of luminous matter , one can not so easily and precisely determine the position of dark matter . and since humans tend not to be absolutely convinced that something exists until they are able to detect the exact place where it exists , the detection of dark matter based on detection of luminous matter is considered less convincing than the detection of luminous matter itself .",
    "now , equipped with this astro - epistemological insight , we can turn back to bohmian mechanics . at the fundamental microscopic level ,",

    "( a modified bohmian theory which would include a local contact interaction between the microscopic particles would lead to measurable predictions that could easily be tested . )    on the other hand , macroscopic objects in bohmian mechanics have a different behavior .",
    "owing to the decoherence @xcite , the wave packets are localized in space , while owing to the ehrenfest theorem @xcite , the wave packets ( within which the motion of particles is confined ) move according to the classical laws . unlike the fundamental microscopic laws , the macroscopic classical laws are local .",
    "thus , it is this macroscopic locality which is responsible for the fact that we can easily and precisely determine the position of the apparatus pointer @xmath380 , and not the position @xmath382 of the microscopic particle .",

    "this is not so good , because this is not how we are used to think about the macroscopic world .",
    "what we want is to obtain a space probability density from the spacetime probability density ( [ e7.6 ] ) .",
    "but this is not really difficult ; we can do that in three little steps . in the first step ,",
    "we introduce a _",
    "macroscopic clock_. the macroscopic clock can not measure the fundamental microscopic proper time @xmath13 ( see also appendix [ secc ] ) . instead , it measures the macroscopic classical proper time @xmath20 given by @xmath401 in the second step , we recall from sec .",
    "[ sec2.1 ] that @xmath20 is naturally interpreted as a known variable , not subject to a probabilistic description .    in the third step",
    "we use the fact that ( [ e7.6 ] ) is covariant , implying that we can choose any coordinates we want .",
    "so we choose some coordinates in which the 3-velocity of the pointer is small compared to the velocity of light , implying that @xmath402 since @xmath20 is naturally interpreted as a known variable , this means that , in these coordinates , @xmath394 is also naturally interpreted as an approximately known variable , not subject to a probabilistic description .",
    "therefore , for practical purposes , the relevant probability density is not ( [ e7.6 ] ) , but the conditional probability @xmath403 where @xmath404 does not depend on @xmath394 due to the positivity of energy ( see appendix [ secb.1 ] ) . in this way ( [ e7.6 ] ) leads to @xmath405 where @xmath406 is normalized so that @xmath407    finally , let @xmath408 be the support of @xmath409 , i.e. the region in @xmath375-space within which @xmath409 is not negligible .",

    "the effective mass squared is negative , which corresponds to a tachyon  a fully relativistic object moving faster than light .",
    "however , a particle moving with the velocity of light has never been observed .",
    "so is such a superluminal behavior in contradiction with observations ?",
    "no it is nt !",
    "when the velocity is measured , then the _ measured _ velocity can not be superluminal .",
    "this can be seen at two levels .",
    "first , at the macroscopic level , the observed velocity of a macroscopic object is determined by the velocity of the localized wave packet , the motion of which is essentially classical so that it never exceeds the velocity of light .",
    "second , at the microscopic level , the measurement of velocity corresponds to the case in which @xmath388 in ( [ e7.4 ] ) are eigenstates of the velocity operator .",
    "the velocity eigenstates are the same as the momentum eigenstates @xmath422 where , due to ( [ e5.13 ] ) , the 4-momentum @xmath423 satisfies @xmath424 , which can not be negative .",
    "consequently , the effective wave function described by ( [ ep ] ) leads to a bohmian velocity which can not exceed the velocity of light .",
    "the bohmian velocity may exceed the velocity of light when the effective wave function is a superposition of different plane waves of the form of ( [ ep ] ) , but such a situation does not correspond to a situation in which the microscopic velocity is accurately measured .",

    "[ sec7.2 ] are written down for the case of measurement of one particle .",
    "on the other hand , to measure nonlocal correlations , at least two particles need to be measured .",
    "nevertheless , it is not difficult to rewrite all the equations of sec .",
    "[ sec7.2 ] to describe the measurement of an arbitrary number of particles .    for simplicity ,",

( [ e7.11 - 2 ] ) is the standard quantum - mechanical formula , containing information about all the correlations between the measurements on two systems , including those that violate bell inequalities @xcite .    in the derivation above we have not used any explicit analysis of particle trajectories , so it may not be totally obvious how exactly the nonlocal particle trajectories explain the final result ( [ e7.11 - 2 ] ) .",
    "this is because the main concern of the theory of measurement is the statistics of positions of the macroscopic pointer , and not the behavior of individual particle trajectories .",
    "nevertheless , nonlocality and relativity are hidden in the intermediate step ( [ e7.5 - 2 ] ) .",
    "this equation is relativistic covariant and could not be right if we did not have spacetime equivariance ( [ st_equivariance ] ) for all times , including times before the probability density approached the decohered form in the second line of ( [ e7.5 - 2 ] ) . and",
    "needles to say , the spacetime - equivariance equation ( [ st_equivariance ] ) itself could not be satisfied if the velocities @xmath433 were not nonlocal .    there is another interesting place where the role of relativity can be seen more explicitly on the observable level .",
    "what if the two measuring apparatuses move with respect to each other with a velocity comparable to the velocity of light ?",
    "the point is that ( [ e7.6 - 2 ] ) is a relativistic scalar _ in each @xmath434 separately_. this means that we can use one system of reference for @xmath435 , another system of reference for @xmath436 , and still obtain the correct result .",
    "thus , instead of ( [ e7.8 ] ) we will have @xmath437 here the primed and unprimed coordinates denote coordinates calculated in two different systems of reference , each corresponding to the system in which the corresponding pointer moves with a velocity much slower than light .",
    "it is easy to see that this does not change the final result ( [ e7.11 - 2 ] ) , which implies that _ the relative motion of the detectors does not affect nonlocal quantum correlations_.      now let us reconsider all these results from the point of view of a practical theoretical physicist who is not interested about any details concerning microscopic particle trajectories or macroscopic particle detectors .",
    "what he wants are the simplest possible practical operational rules which will allow him to calculate the probabilities of measurement outcomes . from our results above such rules",

    "there are two options .",
    "one option is to use the covariant normalization @xmath441 another option is to use the non - covariant normalization @xmath442 however , since the wave function is a positive energy wave function , the integral in ( [ e7normr2 ] ) does not depend on @xmath10 ( appendix [ secb.1 ] ) , so the two normalizations differ by a single universal factor @xmath443 , which does not affect the measurable probability ( [ e7.11r ] ) .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of the practical physicist , it does nt matter which of the two normalizations , ( [ e7normr ] ) or ( [ e7normr2 ] ) , one will use .",

    "we have derived the fundamental spacetime - equivariance equation , explained how an approximate space - equivariance equation emerges from the fundamental spacetime - equivariance equation , and gave an argument that massless particles do not have bohmian trajectories .",
    "we have also developed the relativistic theory of quantum measurement and explained ( i ) how the spacetime probability for the macroscopic pointer leads to the more familiar space probability for the macroscopic pointer , and ( ii ) how that provides the consistency of relativistic bohmian mechanics with probabilistic predictions of standard quantum theory .",
    "in addition ( appendix [ seca ] ) we have explained how some arguments in the literature against existence of relativistic - covariant versions of bohmian mechanics are circumvented by our theory , and argued that nonlocality of the quantum proper time can not be avoided in a wide class of theories obeying a spacetime - equivariance equation .",
    "this work was supported by the ministry of science of the republic of croatia under contract no .",
    "098 - 0982930 - 2864 .",
    "in the literature one can find various general arguments that a relativistic - covariant version of bohmian mechanics is impossible . yet in this paper we claim that we have constructed exactly this .",
    "so to fully defend our theory , we must explicitly explain how exactly such arguments are circumvented by our theory .",
    "the most frequent arguments of this form have been reviewed in @xcite , together with explicit explanations of how the arguments are circumvented by relativistic - covariant bohmian mechanics .",
    "here we do the same for some not - so - frequent arguments , which , however , are proposed by distinguished experts in the field .",
    "we present them in the historical order .      in @xcite ,",
    "hardy considers a specific wave function of two entangled particles and then determines the corresponding bohmian trajectories by using two different versions of non - relativistic bohmian mechanics , each formulated in a different frame of reference .",
    "not surprisingly , he obtains two different results which contradict each other , from which he concludes that one of the frames must be preferred , which violates lorentz invariance .    what is wrong in this argument is an incorrect understanding of the concept of `` violation of lorentz invariance '' . to understand that",
    ", one does not need quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , every macroscopic material object described by classical physics is at rest with respect to some particular reference frame , so by a similar kind of reasoning one might conclude that such an object also `` violates lorentz invariance '' .",
    "but this of course is wrong .",
    "lorentz invariance is not a property of one particular object , or of one particular set of bohmian trajectories .",
    "lorentz invariance is a property of the _ general law _ that determines the motion of this object or particles .",
    "but the general law itself does not determine the motion uniquely , because motion depends also on some initial conditions .",
    "the initial condition , of course , can not be lorentz invariant , which is why a specific solution of the lorentz invariant equations may define some preferred frame . a preferred frame obtained in this way",
    ", however , does not violate lorentz invariance of the theory .",
    "so in the case hardy considers , the relativistic covariant law for particle trajectories ( which does _ not _ have the form of non - relativistic bohmian mechanics in one particular lorentz frame ) has many solutions .",
    "one of the solutions may resemble the trajectories of the first version of non - relativistic bohmian mechanics , while another solution may resemble the trajectories of the second version of non - relativistic bohmian mechanics . which one will be realized in a given run of the hardy experiment",
    "depends on initial conditions of hidden variables ( i.e. spacetime particle positions at an initial proper time @xmath13 ) in that run . in this way , for each run one may have a different preferred frame without violation of lorentz invariance .      in @xcite ,",
    "berndl , drr , goldstein and zangh consider a relativistic covariant law for bohmian particle trajectories similar to that in the present paper .",
    "for such trajectories they show that @xmath19 can not be the _ space _ probability density in all lorentz frames and that these trajectories do not lead to _ space _ equivariance ( which they simply call  equivariance ) .",
    "they use this result to argue that with such a theory it is difficult to make concrete statistical predictions , which makes difficult to show that the theory is compatible with the predictions of standard qm .",
    "what we have shown in this paper is that ( i ) the statistical predictions still _ can _ be made , and ( ii ) that they _ do agree _ with standard qm .",
    "we were able to do that because we have used a property which they did not consider  the spacetime equivariance instead of space equivariance .",
    "the spacetime equivariance gives the spacetime probability density ( not the space probability density ) , but we have explained how under certain conditions , especially those which correspond to measurement by a macroscopic apparatus , space probability density can be obtained from the spacetime probability density .      in @xcite , valentini makes the point that the fundamental laws of non - relativistic bohmian mechanics determine the _ velocity _ of the particle , unlike those of classical mechanics which in the newton form determine the _ acceleration _ of the particle . from",
    "that he concludes that non - relativistic bohmian mechanics is not galilean invariant .",
    "then , by viewing lorentz transformations as a modification of galilean transformations , he argues that it is not reasonable to expect that relativistic bohmian mechanics should be lorentz invariant .",
    "our response is that viewing lorentz transformations as a modification of galilean transformations is not the only way how the lorentz transformations can be viewed .",
    "another ( in fact , more modern ) view , originally introduced by minkowski , is to view lorentz transformations as a generalization of space rotations . in the language of group theory , space rotations are elements of the group so(3 ) , while lorentz transformations are spacetime rotations , i.e. elements of the group so(1,3 ) .",
    "this , indeed , is how we view lorentz transformations in this paper .",
    "non - relativistic bohmian mechanics is space - rotation invariant , and in the same sense in which non - relativistic bohmian mechanics is space - rotation invariant , relativistic bohmian mechanics is lorentz invariant .",
    "an example of relativistic bohmian trajectories for a system with 3 particles.,width=302 ]    in @xcite , gisin shows that any nonlocal hidden variable theory compatible with the predictions of qm can not be relativistic covariant , in the sense that the time ordering of events can not be invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "our main objection to this argument is the abuse of terminology .",
    "namely , in relativistic literature , the property of time - ordering invariance is not called `` covariance '' .",
    "instead , lorentz covariance is a property that the general law of motion has the same form in all lorentz frames , which relativistic bohmian mechanics obeys .",
    "otherwise , this general conclusion by gisin is fully satisfied in relativistic bohmian mechanics .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , where we show an example of bohmian trajectories for a system of 3 particles .",
    "the fundamental microscopic time ordering of hidden variables ( particle positions in spacetime ) is defined by the value of quantum proper time @xmath13 ; those with larger value of @xmath13 come `` later '' .",
    "it is clear from the picture that this @xmath13-ordering does not coincide with the ordering defined by an arbitrary lorentz frame .",
    "in fact , in this example the @xmath13-ordering does not coincide with the ordering defined by _ any _ lorentz frame .",
    "[ fig0 ] also nicely illustrates why in relativistic bohmian mechanics there is no preferred foliation of spacetime . in an attempt to define a preferred hypersurface which connects all points with the same value of @xmath13",
    ", one immediately recognizes that there is an infinite number of such hypersurfaces for any given value of @xmath13 .",
    "neither of them is `` preferred '' in any meaningful sense .",
    "in addition , those who are worried that some particles in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] move faster than light ( which necessarily implies that in some lorentz frames they move backwards in time ) should see sec .",
    "[ sec7.3.3 ] .      in ( [ e5.14 ] ) we have postulated a nonlocal law that determines the quantum proper time .",
    "later we have shown that such a nonlocal proper time is compatible with predictions of qm .",
    "we do not claim that ( [ e5.14 ] ) is the only possible law compatible with predictions of qm .",
    "therefore we address the following question : is it possible to replace ( [ e5.14 ] ) by a _ local _ law for the quantum proper time ? in this subsection",
    "we argue that it is not possible . or more precisely , we propose the following conjecture :    let particle trajectories satisfy an equation of the form @xmath444 where @xmath252 is the quantum proper time .",
    "then , in general , the spacetime - equivariance equation @xmath445 can only be satisfied if the law for @xmath252 is nonlocal .",
    "we do not have a rigorous proof of the conjecture .",
    "nevertheless , we can present a simple argument for its validity as follows .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) implies @xmath446 the requirement that this law for @xmath252 should be local means that @xmath447 where @xmath448 is some function which does not depend on other positions except @xmath172 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath449 should also be a local function @xmath450 , but this seems impossible to reconcile with the equivariance equation ( [ a2 ] ) for an arbitrary nonlocal wave function @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , it seems that ( [ a8 ] ) can not be true , implying that the law ( [ a7 ] ) can not be local .",
    "in this appendix we study some properties of positive - energy wave functions . for simplicity we study the case of 1-particle wave function , but",
    "all the results can be trivially generalized to @xmath24-particle wave functions as well .",
    "consider a wave packet @xmath451 where the energy @xmath452 is positive .",
    "if energy is positive in one lorentz frame , then @xmath453 implies that it is positive in all lorentz frames .",
    "the measure @xmath454 is not lorentz invariant , but the transformation of @xmath455 under lorentz transformations can be defined such that ( [ eb2.1 ] ) is lorentz invariant .",
    "this can be seen by writing @xmath456 because the measure @xmath457 is lorentz invariant , so ( [ eb2.1 ] ) is lorentz invariant if we define the transformation of @xmath455 such that @xmath458 transforms as a lorentz scalar .",
    "now consider the inner product @xmath459 where @xmath460 is another positive - energy wave packet with @xmath461 instead of @xmath455 . since @xmath462 is not a lorentz - invariant measure ,",
    "this inner product is not lorentz invariant . nevertheless , this inner product is interesting even in the relativistic context because it does not depend on @xmath18 .",
    "here we prove this by generalizing a result in @xcite .",
    "using the expansion ( [ eb2.1 ] ) for both @xmath120 and @xmath463 and exploiting the identity @xmath464 ( [ inner ] ) gives @xmath465 the factor @xmath466 implies that the only contribution to the integral comes from @xmath467 , in which case @xmath468 .",
    "this implies that @xmath469 , so ( [ inner2 ] ) reduces to @xmath470 which does not depend on @xmath18 . in this derivation ,",
    "the crucial assumption is that both wave packets are positive - energy wave packets . if we had a superposition of both positive and negative energies",
    ", then we would have factors of the form @xmath471 or @xmath472 , which would not be @xmath18-independent when @xmath467 .",
    "of course , if we had only negative energies , the inner product would be @xmath18-independent again .    as a special case , ( [ inner3 ] ) implies that the norm @xmath473 does not depend on @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we use this result several times .      for a given wave function @xmath120 and a given operator @xmath474",
    ", we define the quantity @xmath475 and refer to it as `` average value '' , having in mind that this may not have the usual statistical meaning of average value if @xmath476 can not be interpreted as a probability density in space .",
    "likewise , we define the `` standard deviation '' @xmath477 with a similar caveat regarding its statistical meaning .",
    "a quantity of a particular interest is the average energy , which can be expressed as @xmath478 it is easy to see that this is equal to @xmath479 which does not depend on @xmath18 .    in the following",
    "we shall consider more complicated quantities involving products of @xmath480 and @xmath120 . to save writing , for that purpose",
    "it is convenient to introduce the short - hand notation @xmath481 @xmath482 where @xmath483 is an arbitrary function . with this notation",
    "we find @xmath484 @xmath485 so @xmath486 from those results we find @xmath487 @xmath488 so we can write @xmath489 where @xmath490    now let us assume that the wave packet ( [ eb2.1 ] ) is very narrow in the @xmath491 space , i.e. that the uncertainty of energy @xmath492 is much smaller than the average energy @xmath493 . in that case the integrals in ( [ eb2.e2 ] ) can be approximated by replacing the integration variables @xmath494 and @xmath495 with their average value @xmath496 .",
    "the average value is a constant that can be put in front of the integral , so ( [ eb2.e2 ] ) becomes @xmath497 this shows that actually @xmath498 so ( [ eb2.e1 ] ) implies @xmath499 this justifies the approximation @xmath500 used in ( [ e5.40 ] ) .",
    "_ left _ : spacetime trajectory on the macroscopic level , with velocity fairly smaller than the velocity of light .",
    "_ right _ : zoomed spacetime trajectory on the microscopic level , having the velocity of light everywhere except on a set of measure zero.,width=226 ]    to understand that macroscopic proper time may differ from the microscopic one , one does not necessarily need relativistic bohmian mechanics .",
    "such a phenomenon appears also at the purely classical level .    for that purpose",
    "consider the spacetime trajectory of a macroscopic object in fig .",
    "it is a trajectory of an object moving relatively slowly compared to the velocity of light , so the proper time @xmath20 associated with the trajectory is quite large .    on the other hand , by zooming the trajectory down to microscopic distances , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one reveals that the trajectory is actually a zigzag trajectory , such that the actual velocity is equal to the velocity of light everywhere except on a set of measure zero .",
    "so the microscopic proper time @xmath20 is zero .",
    "so , what is the true proper time associated with the trajectory ? this question is very much analogous to the question `` how long is the coast of britain ? '' famously asked by mandelbrot to explain the idea of fractals ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the answer is that there is no `` true '' length . instead , the length depends on scale on which the measurement is performed .",
    "analogously , there is no `` true '' proper time either .",
    "it depends on the scale on which the measurement is performed . in the case of fig .",
