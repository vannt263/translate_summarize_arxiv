    "the cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum follows a power law which exhibits several interesting features .",
    "a break ( known as the knee ) between a power law with index -2.7 to index -3.0 occurs near @xmath5 ev .",
    "a similar break ( the second knee ) from index -3.0 to -3.3 has been reported to occur near @xmath6 ev @xcite , followed by a rise to an index of -2.7 ( the ankle ) near @xmath7 ev .",
    "the spectrum appears to continue until @xmath8 ev .",
    "changes in spectral index at various energies could be produced by a gradual decrease in efficiency with energy of a source ( e.g. , galactic supernovae ) , leakage out of an area of magnetic confinement ( the galactic leaky box model ) , the appearance of flux from new sources that begin to dominate at higher energies ( extra - galactic cosmic rays ) , and thresholds of inelastic interactions between cr protons and the cosmic microwave background radiation ( @xmath9 and pion production , ( the gzk effect @xcite ) ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the hadronic interaction of the cr with the atmosphere undergoes changes above certain energies which would affect the measured energy of the cr and hence produce an apparent change in the power law index @xcite .",
    "a knowledge of cr composition as a function of energy would be invaluable in sorting out these effects .",
    "high energy cosmic rays have long been known to be charged nuclei @xcite , but determining the chemical composition at energies greater than 10@xmath10 ev is especially difficult because of the low flux .",
    "the high resolution fly s eye cosmic ray observatory has a large enough aperture ( 3@xmath1110@xmath12 to 5@xmath1110@xmath13 km@xmath12 str ) but it observes the extensive air shower ( eas ) produced by the particle rather than detecting the primary itself , and thus must use an indirect method to study the composition .",
    "the distribution of positions of shower maxima ( x@xmath0 ) in the atmosphere has been shown to be sensitive to the composition of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for any particular species of nucleus , the position of shower maximum will deepen with increasing energy as the logarithm of the energy .",
    "the slope , @xmath14 , is known as the elongation rate @xcite .    while the details are dependent on the hadronic model assumed , all modern hadronic models give approximately the same elongation rate ( between 50 and 60 g @xmath1 per decade of energy , independent of particle species ) and agree within about 25 g @xmath1 on the absolute position of the average shower x@xmath0 at a given energy for a given species .",
    "the sensitivity of the x@xmath0 method to composition comes from the fact that the mean x@xmath0 for iron and protons is different by about 75 g @xmath1 , independent of hadronic model with protons producing deeper showers with larger fluctuations .",
    "a change in the composition from heavy to light would then result in a larger elongation rate than 50 - 60 g @xmath1 per decade , and a change from light to heavy would lead to a lower and even negative elongation rate .",
    "previous experiments ( stereo fly s eye @xcite , hires prototype - mia @xcite ) have shown evidence for an elongation rate of 80 - 90 g @xmath1 g @xmath1 per decade in the energy rage from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ev .",
    "no significant information from air - fluorescence experiments has been hitherto available on the behavior of the elongation rate near @xmath17 ev and above",
    ".    the general dependence of x@xmath0 on energy can be seen in a simple branching model where @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite . in this model , if the primary particle is a nucleus the shower is assumed to be a superposition of subshowers each initiated by one of the a independent nucleons .",
    "the primary energy must be divided among the a constituents , so in this case @xmath20 .",
    "a more complete discussion leads to linsley s expression for the elongation rate , @xmath21 , @xcite , which is    @xmath22 \\label{lins}\\ ] ]    where k is a constant , @xmath23 is the collision length , and b expresses the dependence of @xmath21 on the hadron - air nucleus interactions .",
    "it includes both the energy dependence of the cross - section ( and thus @xmath23 ) and the energy dependence of the multiplicity and inelasticity @xcite .",
    "the technique for extracting the cosmic ray composition used in this paper reduces to comparing the x@xmath0 distribution of the data , after appropriate cuts that guarantee good resolution in this variable , to simulated data , generated with either a proton or iron parent particle .",
    "the simulated data is the result of a detailed detector monte carlo and includes all the reconstruction uncertainties .",
    "the high resolution fly s eye cosmic ray observatory ( hires ) has two sites on the u.s .",
    "army s dugway proving ground in the west desert of utah , about 90 miles from salt lake city .",
    "the first site , hires-1 , is on little granite mountain , the site of the original fly s eye detector .",
    "hires-2 is 12.6 km to the southwest on camel s back ridge .",
    "dugway was chosen for its clean atmosphere and low light pollution .",
    "each site is on a hill , above the bulk of most haze in the atmosphere .",
    "the two sites gather data independently , and the data can be analyzed from each site in monocular mode or together in stereo mode .",
    "results from a monocular analysis of the spectrum have been published @xcite .",
    "the accurate determination of the shower geometry is an essential first step to determining the shower profile , which gives the energy of the primary uhecr and the x@xmath0 of the shower .",
    "this work will present results from stereo analysis , which has an obvious advantage in determining the shower geometry and hence better resolution in energy and x@xmath0 .",
    "hires is the realization of an extension of the method pioneered by the original fly s eye experiment @xcite . as a uhecr - initiated extensive air shower ( eas )",
    "propagates through the atmosphere , the charged particles excite nitrogen molecules , which fluoresce . the fluorescence yield and its spectrum",
    "have both been measured @xcite .",
    "the fluorescence yield is about five photons per particle per meter .",
    "the photons , mostly of wavelength 300 - 400 nm , propagate isotropically from the shower core , with the number of photons coming from a slice of the shower proportional to the number of charged particles in that slice .",
    "in addition to air fluorescence , erenkov light is produced by shower particles .",
    "the erenkov cone in air is @xmath24 and the resultant light angular distribution , reflecting the multiple scattering of electrons , is strongly beamed forward along the eas axis .",
    "some of this light , however , will scatter at larger angles into the detector and needs to be subtracted from the total signal .",
    "air fluorescence detectors gather the photons and focus them onto arrays of photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "each pmt views a solid angle of the sky , and a composite view is recovered when the images from the constituent mirrors are combined .",
    "the hires prototype detector , results from which are also summarized in this paper , was located on little granite mountain @xcite .",
    "the prototype detector viewed from @xmath25 to @xmath26 in elevation and had an azimuthal coverage that overlooks the michigan muon array ( mia ) 3.4 km away .",
    "coincident hybrid data were collected from 1993 to 1996 .",
    "results on composition near @xmath15 ev were published in @xcite .    in 1997 ,",
    "the aperture for events at the highest energies was optimized by redeploying the telescopes in a ring with full @xmath27 azimuthal coverage and @xmath25 to @xmath28 elevational coverage @xcite .",
    "hires-1 began taking data in may of 1997 , and the ring was complete in march of 1998 .",
    "hires-2 has two rings , giving complete azimuthal coverage with an elevation coverage from @xmath25 to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses data from november of 1999 , which is when hires-2 was completely operational , to september of 2001 .",
    "the basic hires element is a telescope consisting of a mirror of area 5.2 m@xmath30 with an associated cluster of 256 pmts and data - acquisition ( daq ) electronics .",
    "the pmt cluster is placed at a distance from the mirror which optimizes the spot size .",
    "@xcite . taking into account the cluster obscuration ,",
    "the effective area of each mirror is 3.72 m@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the pointing directions of the individual telescopes were surveyed at installation and are checked periodically by observing signals produced by stars @xcite .",
    "the primary tool for the calibration of pmt sensitivity is a xenon flash lamp mounted in a portable housing that can be moved from telescope to telescope .",
    "it is placed in the center of the mirror , illuminating the cluster directly .",
    "the lamp s output has been measured to be stable to within 1/3% flash - to - flash and within 2% over the course of a night @xcite .    to monitor the pmt response on a nightly basis , each site has a frequency - tripled yag laser which delivers light at 355 nm to each pmt cluster via quartz optical fibers .",
    "one fiber goes to the center of each mirror , and one to each side of each pmt cluster .",
    "the mirror - mounted fibers illuminate the cluster directly allowing monitoring of tube response , while the cluster - mounted fibers illuminate the mirrors so mirror reflectivity can be tracked@xcite .",
    "photons from an eas travel through the atmosphere to reach the telescopes , and understanding light transmission through the atmosphere is vital . the atmosphere can be considered a mix of molecules and aerosols .",
    "rayleigh scattering from molecules is well understood , as is the atmospheric density profile .",
    "scattering from aerosols varies with the aerosol content of the air and must be measured .",
    "we characterize the aerosol scattering by the horizontal aerosol extinction length , l@xmath31 , the vertical aerosol optical depth , vaod , and by the angular dependence of the scattering cross section ( the phase function ) .",
    "lasers with steerable beams , located at both hires-1 and hires-2 sites , are used to sweep the hires aperture and determine the horizontal extinction length , vaod and phase function @xcite .",
    "a database of the hourly parameterizations of the atmosphere is used in monte carlo and for the reconstruction of every event for which it is available @xcite . for the final data set ,",
    "about three - quarters of the events were reconstructed with atmospheric parameters from the hourly database and the remainder were reconstructed with the average values ( see section [ atcut ] ) .",
    "the laser tracks also give an indication of clouds in the aperture .",
    "the track of a laser hitting a cloud will mushroom out , giving a shorter , wider signature .",
    "other tools for understanding the clarity of the atmosphere include operator observations , infrared cloud monitors , and xenon flashers @xcite . one inclined and ten vertical xenon flashers located between the two hires sites are fired every ten minutes and give important qualitative information about the atmosphere between the sites .",
    "the initial steps in the data processing chain are documented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , calibration information is applied to the raw data . the relative timing information from each mirror is then converted to an absolute time as determined by gps @xcite .",
    "the individual mirror triggers are matched to form multiple - mirror events , and the multiple - mirror events from each site are time - matched to build stereo events . to separate noise events from track - like events ,",
    "a rayleigh filter is employed @xcite .",
    "the probability that an event was created by random noise is required to be less than 0.1% .",
    "the axis of the eas and the position of the detector uniquely define the shower - detector plane ( sdp ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . the location and pointing direction of each pmt cluster",
    "have been measured @xcite , so the pointing direction n@xmath32 of each pmt is known and the sdp is easily found .    once the sdp is known for each site , the intersection of the planes gives the direction and location of the eas .",
    "the next step in the reconstruction is to calculate the shower development profile .",
    "however , light arriving at the detector is collected by discrete pmts , each of which covers about @xmath33 of the sky .",
    "the signal from a longitudinal segment of the eas is thus necessarily split among many pmts . for profile",
    "fitting , the signal must be re - combined into bins that correspond to the longitudinal segments of the eas .",
    "the re - binned signal , corrected for atmospheric extinction and with erenkov light subtracted is fit to a gaisser - hillas functional form ( eq . [ gh ] ) .",

    "the energy of the event is calculated from the shower profile exactly as in the angular binning technique .      to insure that both detectors were working properly , only data files in which at least 20 xenon vertical flashers events ( see section 3 ) are seen by both eyes",

    "additional loose cuts described in table [ cut_table ] were used to remove obviously badly reconstructed events and stereo mismatches without biasing the data sample . for the period between november of 1999 and september of 2001 , 728 events met all of the above criteria and",
    "were subjected to the atmospheric cuts .      for this analysis ,",
    "any event with a corresponding vaod measurement of larger than 0.1 was cut .",
    "however , because of equipment down time , the atmosphere was not measured for every hour for which we have data . in that case the operators log comments and measurements of laser track length vs. width ( see section [ netatm ] ) were searched .",

    "[ f14 ] and [ f15 ] show the pull , defined as 2(x@xmath47 - x@xmath48)/(x@xmath47 + x@xmath48 ) , where x@xmath47 and x@xmath48 are from the individual fits by hires-1 and hires-2 , respectively , after all cuts .",
    "the nearly - gaussian shape of the pull and the nearly identical pull distribution for monte carlo and data show that the monte carlo resolution represents the real detector resolution well .",

    "[ f16][f18 ] show the dependence of the data and monte carlo pull on x@xmath0 , e , r@xmath55 and @xmath56 angles .",
    "there is excellent agreement between data and monte carlo and no significant dependence of the pull on any of these variables .",
    "while the data pull distribution can not be directly used to obtain the global x@xmath0 resolution , the excellent agreement between data and mc pulls implies that the mc estimate of the global x@xmath0 resolution is reliable .",
    "the data were binned in energy as shown in table [ data_table ] .",
    "the statistical errors are the standard error of the mean .    fig .",

    "uncertainties in energy do not have a large affect on er because of the logarithmic energy scale .",
    "any systematic uncertainty in x@xmath0 which applies over the entire energy range will change the absolute value of x@xmath0 , but will not change the er . to affect er , the systematic uncertainty must shift x@xmath0 in an energy - dependent way .    as discussed in section [ atcut ] ,",
    "the measured average atmosphere at hires is parameterized by an aerosol vertical optical depth of 0.04 @xmath4 0.02 ( sys ) . because the database used to obtain this result was used in the reconstruction of about 3/4 of the events , the statistical variation about this mean is already represented in the data and the monte carlo .",
    "the effect of the systematic error on the mean is studied by re - processing the data with a dirtier atmosphere . just as in the original processing ,",
    "the atmospheric database was sampled and either the database entry or the standard atmosphere was used , as appropriate . since horizontal extinction is measured separately while the scale height is inferred , for each event , the aerosol scale height was increased such that the optical depth was increased by 0.02 .",
    "the dominant effect of the dirtier atmosphere was to increase the reconstructed energies .",
    "the reconstructed x@xmath0 values also decreased slightly , with the two effects combining to steepen the er , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f20 ] . because the energy scale is logarithmic the introduced change in the er is small .",
    "since 24% of the data was reconstructed using an average atmosphere , we check that deleting this part of the data does not significantly affect our value for the elongation rate .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f19 ] .",
    "the modeling of the erenkov beam in the reconstruction program can introduce an energy - dependent uncertainty in x@xmath0 . while the absolute intensity of erenkov radiation is well known",
    ", the effective angular distribution in an eas depends on the multiple scattering of electrons in the atmosphere , which has some uncertainties . to investigate this ,",
    "the reconstruction code was modified to make the modeled eas erenkov beam 2@xmath59 wider ( consistent with one sigma errors in previous measurements ) , and the data were reprocessed . the er was essentially unchanged .",
    "protons are expected to show more shower - to - shower fluctuation than iron nuclei .",
    "[ f21 ] shows that at each of the three energies , both qgsjet and sibyll predict that the distribution of x@xmath0 is wider for proton showers than for iron showers .",

    "[ f23 ] and [ f24 ] , the data were divided into two energy bins selected such that each contained about half of the events .",

    "[ f25 ] and [ f26 ] indicates that the composition is predominantly light in agreement with the elongation rate interpretation .",
    "these figures also show the contribution of the 24% of the data reconstructed with an average atmosphere .",
    "there is no statistically significant difference between this sample and the total data sample .    figs .",
    "[ f25 ] and [ f26 ] show that the data are consistent with a nearly purely protonic composition , especially when compared to the qgsjet model . assuming a simple two - component model where the primary flux is a mixture of protons and iron nuclei , fig .",
    "[ f27 ] shows how well the model fits the data as a function of fraction of protons .",
    "the best fits are at 80% protons for qgsjet and 60% for sibyll .",
    "[ f27 ] also shows the models compared to the data .",
    "fig . [ f27 ] suggests that the composition of uhecr is predominantly light above @xmath46 ev .",
    "however , systematic errors in the absolute value of x@xmath0 could artificially move the measured x@xmath0 values too deep in the atmosphere .",
    "the x@xmath0 values for events with energies above @xmath17 ev are of particular interest .",
    "potential contributors to the systematic uncertainty in x@xmath0 are biases introduced by reconstruction , errors in pmt pointing directions , variations of the molecular and aerosol component of the atmosphere , and incorrect treatments of the erenkov beam .    resolution studies ( figs . [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] ) show that the mean of the reconstructed x@xmath0 distribution differs by 5 g @xmath1 from the input value . for events with",
    "energy greater than @xmath17 ev , the mean of the distribution shifts by 3 g @xmath1 .",
    "the phototube cluster pointing directions have been confirmed by observing stars @xcite .",
    "the largest deviation of true pointing direction from the direction used in reconstruction is 0.3@xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum x@xmath0 error of 15 g @xmath1 .",
    "the molecular component of the atmosphere may be different from the u.s .",
    "standard atmosphere @xcite assumed in the reconstruction .",
    "the variations in the atmosphere as measured by radiosondes launched from the salt lake city airport has been studied @xcite . in the month of the year which varied most from the standard model , the actual pressure differed from the model by 8% , which leads to a 10 g @xmath1 difference in integrated atmospheric depth .",
    "subsequent studies by y. fedorova of radiosonde data over several years have confirmed this initial study .",
    "using an incorrect atmospheric attenuation could distort the shower profile and systematically shift the position of x@xmath0 .",
    "[ f20 ] shows that above @xmath17 ev , an increase as large as 0.02 in vaod ( a 50% change ) does not significantly change the mean values of x@xmath0 .",
    "as described in section [ systematics ] , the data were reprocessed with a larger value of erenkov beam width .",
    "the mean difference between the x@xmath0 obtained from reconstruction with the standard erenkov beam width and the x@xmath0 obtained by using a wider beam is less than 1 g @xmath1 and is negligible .",
    "table [ sys_table ] summarizes the systematic uncertainties in x@xmath0 for energies above @xmath17 ev . adding the individual uncertainties in quadrature gives an overall systematic uncertainty of less than 20 g @xmath1 . this is less than the detector resolution and much less than the 75 g @xmath1 difference between proton and iron mean x@xmath0 .",
    "the measured elongation rate result is consistent with a constant or slowly changing composition between @xmath2 ev and @xmath3 ev . the data are also in very good agreement with the hires prototype data in the region where they nearly overlap .",
    "the hires prototype result showed a composition change from heavy to light in the @xmath15 to @xmath46 ev range , but the hires data do not show a continuation of this elongation rate .",
    "this can be interpreted as strong evidence for a transition from a heavy composition to a predominantly light and constant or only slowly changing composition above @xmath46 ev .",
    "the earlier fly s eye stereo data also shows a transition from a heavy to a light composition though with a broader transition region in energy .",
    "this is consistent with the present data if systematic errors and worse x@xmath0 resolution quoted in that work are taken into account @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the widths of the x@xmath0 distributions in the uhecr regime strengthen this conclusion .",
    "such a transition is interesting in light of reported structure in the uhecr spectrum in this same energy region .",
    "many experiments have seen evidence for a second knee in the middle of the @xmath15 decade and an ankle structure near 3 x @xmath46 ev . the change in composition may reflect a change from a dominant galactic cr flux to an extragalactic flux which dominates near @xmath17 ev .",
    "observation of anisotropy from the galactic plane would support this picture .",
    "some evidence for such anisotropy has been reported @xcite .",
