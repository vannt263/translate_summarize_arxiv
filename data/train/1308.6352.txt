    "over the last two decades type ia supernovae ( sne ) , have become important tools for measuring basic cosmological parameters and the energy content of the universe @xcite .",
    "sne ia are likely the explosions of carbon - oxygen degenerate stars in binary systems @xcite .",
    "however the evolutionary channels leading to sn ia events are only crudely understood , and the physical state of the progenitor star and details of the explosion mechanism(s ) are still debated .    in a single - degenerate scenario",
    "the white dwarf ( wd ) evolves towards explosion by accreting hydrogen or helium from a non - degenerate stellar companion @xcite , whereas in a double - degenerate scenario the explosion is caused by a merger of two degenerate stars @xcite . at present the delayed detonation models with varying deflagration - to - detonation transition density in a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf offer a good agreement with sn ia observations , e.g. , for the range of luminosities and the stratification of chemical elements @xcite .",
    "the study of the photometric and spectroscopic properties of sne ia requires numerical radiative - transfer tools .",
    "the early work of @xcite and @xcite used analytic modeling to extract a basic understanding of their bolometric light curve and to estimate the ejecta kinetic energy and @xmath3ni mass .",
    "unfortunately , this approach does not yield constraints on important ejecta properties , such as chemical composition and stratification , and lacks information on color evolution .",
    "there are a number of approaches for doing the radiative transfer of sne ia more accurately .",
    "one approach is to treat the photospheric layers exclusively and assume steady state .",
    "radiation transport is undertaken using the monte carlo technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or by solving the transfer equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the advantages of this approach are computational speed , and the ease with which model parameters and abundances can be altered to fit models to observations .",
    "the drawback is that model adjustments may be used erroneously to overcome missing physics ( either in the atomic data or in the model )",
    ". one major disadvantage of the method is that the infrared spectral range is optically thin even before the @xmath2-band maximum , and the concept of a well defined photosphere becomes meaningless .",
    "another approach is to perform time - dependent radiation transport and model the entire sn ejecta .",
    "this has been done using gray or multi - group radiative transfer ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the gas is treated in local - thermodynamic - equilibrium ( lte ) and the opacities are approximated using the formalism of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "continuum and line opacity contributions are summed over an energy bin and the transfer is solved for each bin .",
    "one alternative uses the monte carlo technique @xcite .",
    "the benefit is the possibility of extension to 3d but the drawback is again the approximate treatment of the thermodynamic state of the gas .    whether we consider sne or stellar atmospheres , the leakage of radiative energy through the photosphere is known to drive the material out of lte @xcite .",
    "however , because of the fast expansion and small mass of sne ia , the low ejecta density prevents lte conditions even at depth as early as the peak of the bolometric light curve .",
    "there is thus much interest in designing radiative - transfer tools that explicitly treat the non - lte aspects of the problem , i.e. , by solving the statistical equilibrium equations directly @xcite , while solving simultaneously for the radiation transport transport problem time dependently @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss our own efforts , started in 2008 , to model sne ia with . in its present form ,",
    "the code contains a number of important improvements implemented in recent years , primarily for the modelling of core - collapse sne .",
    "the line blanketed aspects are discussed in @xcite in the context of hot star winds ; the modifications to treat sn atmospheres are discussed in @xcite ; the extension for the time - dependent treatment of the statistical - equilibrium equations is presented in @xcite ; the philosophy of the full time - dependent approach for both the gas and the radiation is given in @xcite , with details given in @xcite .",
    "our approach is non - lte , time dependent , and solves for the gas and radiation properties at all depths , from the innermost to the outermost ejecta mass shells .",
    "the non - lte treatment applies to the full radiative - transfer problem , hence allows the same level of sophistication for the computation of the light curves and the spectra .",
    "the multi - band light curves are computed by direct integration of the emergent wavelength - dependent flux computed by the non - lte time - dependent solver along the time sequence .",
    "our non - lte approach conserves energy and provides a physical solution to multi - band light curves and spectral evolution _",
    "simultaneously_. the interaction between radiation and matter is solved exactly , i.e. , without any ad - hoc prescription for the nature of opacity and emissivity sources .    in @xcite , we presented the results for a set of delayed - detonation models and compared their radiative properties to observed sne ia at bolometric maximum . here , we discuss the technical aspects of sn ia radiative transfer modelling using the hydrodynamical delayed detonation model ddc10 . in a future paper",
    "we will cover in greater depth the properties of the radiative transfer in sn ia ejecta and photospheres , discussing the departures from lte , the thermalization / scattering character of spectral lines , as well as spectrum formation .",
    "we delay to subsequent papers the discussion of dependencies of the sn ia radiation on ejecta properties , in particular on the abundance of ni synthesized in the explosion .",
    "an important message from our work on sne ia is that with detailed non - lte radiative transfer , we can reproduce the fundamental sn ia light curve and spectral properties with the basic delayed - detonation scenario , even with the assumption of _ spherical symmetry_. although this represents a very important result , it has limited value if we do not understand why or how it works . until recently we were unable to reproduce the fundamental radiative properties of type ia sne .",
    "the reasons for this failure were related to assumptions in the modeling , rather than issues with the properties of the progenitor and the explosion model .",
    "so , rather than only presenting the properties of the radiative - transfer model that works , we also present the original models we ran and describe how they failed ( section  [ sect_atom ] ) .",
    "we describe the numerous attempts to solve the discrepancies , roughly in a chronological order , and present some ingredients that solve these problems ( section  [ sect_sol ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the impact of non - local energy deposition and @xmath4-ray escape on sn ia properties ( section  [ sect_loc_noloc ] ) , as well as the influence of non - thermal processes ( section  [ sect_nonte ] ) .",
    "having covered the various ingredients controlling sn ia radiation , we study the origin of the secondary maximum observed in near - ir sn ia light curves ( section  [ sect_nearir ] ) .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ sect_conc ] .",
    "all simulations presented in this work start from the same delayed - detonation model ddc10 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a description of the hydrodynamical model and the basic set up for the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "works in the same standard form for any sn ejecta .",
    "hence , the simulations we present here are all carried out with the standard line - blanketed non - lte time - dependent radiative - transfer technique presented in @xcite .",
    "what differentiates one sn simulation from another is the hydrodynamical input ( composition etc . ) and the model atoms employed .",
    "because the sn ia ejecta are thin early on , we allow for non - local energy deposition in all models beyond 10d after explosion , unless stated otherwise . as discussed in the appendix of @xcite we use a monte carlo approach for the @xmath4-ray transport .",
    "similarly , given the large abundance of unstable nuclei , we treat non - thermal processes , with the method presented in @xcite . in its original form , the non - thermal solver included excitation rates for all ions but ionization rates only for the ions specified in an input file .",
    "in the course of this work , we realized that not all intermediate - mass elements ( imes ) and iron - group elements ( iges ) were included in this file . we had c , o , ne , na , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni , but by mistake did not have entries for ti , cr , and co. this was corrected in model ddc10_a4d1 using additional cross sections from @xcite , to complement those provided by @xcite .",
    "the flexibility in  permits the testing of numerous effects , in particular the influence of model atoms whose characteristics can be easily adjusted ( e.g. , number of levels , number of transitions , super - level assignments , source of atomic data ; see appendix  [ appendix_atom ] ) . in our simulations , we include c , o , ne , na , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , sc , ti , v , cl , k , cr , mn , fe , co , and ni. when a given ion becomes sub - dominant at all depths because of recombination , its impact on the radiative transfer becomes negligible and it is conveniently excluded from the computation at all subsequent times .",
    "species v , cl , k are only included if / because they belong to decay routes that we wanted to incorporate in the calculation ( see below ) . however , because we are not attempting to describe accurately their potential impact on the transfer ( and also because we do not have a satisfactory set of model atoms for the corresponding ions ) , we only include the ground state of a single ionization state for each of these species ( i.e. , v , cl , and k ) .",
    "we discuss the properties of sn ia radiation at times that encompass the initial brightening of the object ( from day one to the light curve peak ) , the maximum light properties ( see also @xcite ) and the transition to the nebular phase until 60d after explosion .",
    "this bridges very diverse conditions  from optically thick to optically thin and with different processes dominant in different density regimes .",
    "the code handles this evolution in a smooth fashion . in practice",
    ", the inner boundary for the radiative transfer is the same as the inner boundary of the ejecta , i.e. , we do time - dependent simulations for _ the full ejecta _ at all times . in model ddc10 , this inner boundary is at a velocity @xmath5 of 490 . because there is no dynamics in our simulations , the velocity distribution in mass space is fixed throughout a  sequence .",
    "when the ejecta is optical thick , we impose a zero - flux condition at @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath60 at all frequencies @xmath7 , and the incoming intensity @xmath8 is set equal to the local planck function at @xmath7 .",
    "when the ejecta turns thin , we impose a nebular condition at @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath7  and @xmath10 are shifted to account for the doppler shift along the ray ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is important to realize that , in this approach , the entire ejecta is modeled at all times by , i.e. , that the radiative transfer is solved at all depths with merely a change in inner boundary condition at @xmath5 when the ejecta turns nebular .",
    "this transition occurs earlier in the near - ir than in the uv , so we tend to switch to the nebular condition when the rosseland - mean optical depth is still well above unity .",
    ".summary of model assumptions for our sn ia radiative - transfer calculations with .",
    "all radiative - transfer simulations are based on the delayed - detonation model named ddc10 , which is characterized by an initial ni mass of 0.65   ( see @xcite for details ) , and start at one day after explosion .",
    "simulations include either one ( ni ) or all 2-step decay chains presented in table  [ tab_nuc1][tab_nuc2 ] .",
    "@xmath4-ray energy deposition is treated as local (  l \" ) or solved for using a monte carlo transport approach (  nl \" ) .",
    "atom refers to the characteristics of the model atoms used for the  calculations .",
    "[ tab_modset ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "energy wise , the ni decay chain is the most important for sne ia calculation .",
    "however , other chains may need to be considered if they are associated with unstable isotopes present in regions where ni is absent ( for example in the outer ejecta ) , or if these chains produce isotopes with a potentially strong line blanketing power .",
    "this is the case of ti , whose mass fraction can be increased by two orders of magnitude through the decay of cr and v.    we have modified  to handle multiple decay chains , either 2-step like ni @xmath11 co @xmath11 fe , or 1-step . in this work , we generally treat only the ni decay chain , but investigate at times the impact of having all 2-step decay chains presented in tables  [ tab_nuc1][tab_nuc2 ] .",
    "the role of 1-step decay chains is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo transport code that calculates the non - local @xmath4-ray energy deposition was modified to handle the same chains .      for an illustration , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_nuc ] the effect on the bolometric light curve of introducing all 2-step decay chains rather than ni decay chain only .",
    "the effect is at most of @xmath1210% , and limited to early , i.e. pre - peak , times .",
