    "such a data set allows - via a comparison to local reference samples - to study the evolution of fundamental parameters of galaxies , like luminosity , size , mass , @xmath3 ratio etc .",
    ", as a function of cosmic time . by applying models that fully account for observational effects like seeing and the influence of the slit width , we were able to extract spatially resolved rotation curves from the spectra and derive the galaxies maximum rotation velocities as well as the total masses for 124 galaxies in our data set .",
    "in @xcite , we reported on an earlier stage of our survey and presented evidence for a slope change of the tully  fisher relation ( tfr ) between @xmath4 and the local universe , i.e.  a mass - dependent luminosity evolution . using the new , full sample of 124 galaxies",
    ", we found that this differential evolution could be attributed to the magnitude limit in our target selection , but _ only _ if the scatter of the tfr at @xmath4 is more than a factor of 3 larger than in the local universe ( for details , please see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the fraction between the stellar and total mass remains roughly constant between redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( see left plot of fig .  1 )",
    ", which could be understood in terms of smooth accretion of dark and baryonic matter over this epoch . if spiral galaxies already contained all their dark and baryonic matter at @xmath1 , the conversion of gas into stars via continuous star formation would lead to an increase of the stellar mass fraction @xmath6 towards lower redshifts , which is not observed .",

    "the stellar mass - to - light ratios evolve more strongly for low - luminosity spirals than for high - luminosity spirals ( fig .  1 right ) , yielding evidence for an anti - hierarchical evolution of the stellar populations ( the `` down - sizing '' scenario ) .",
    "this interpretation gains further support from fits of single - zone models to the optical and nir colors : we find that the mean model stellar ages of the distant low - mass spirals are younger than those of the distant high - mass spirals , see @xcite .",
    "this mass - dependency of the stellar ages has to be counter - balanced by the evolution of other galaxy parameters to explain the little evolution observed in the de - biased tfr slope .",
