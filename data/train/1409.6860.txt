    "since the inception of quantum mechanics , it is well - known that the ( non - relativistic , born - oppenheimer ) hamiltonian governing many - electron atoms leaves the simultaneous eigenspaces of the angular momentum , spin and parity ( ls ) operators @xmath11 invariant . from a practical perspective , the restriction to symmetry subspaces can significantly reduce computational costs ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in particular , such a restriction is an essential ingredient for configuration interaction  ( ci ) approximation methods in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , simultaneous diagonalization of the operators   on the full ci space is encumbered by the inherent `` curse of dimensionality '' , which renders `` naive '' @xmath12 approaches infeasible .",

    "analogously for spin , @xmath19 with @xmath20 for @xmath21 the usual pauli matrices @xmath22 acting on electron @xmath15 .",
    "the components of the angular and spin operators obey the well - known commutator relations @xmath23 = { \\mathbbm{i}}l_{\\gamma}$ ] and @xmath24 = { \\mathbbm{i}}s_{\\gamma}$ ] with @xmath25 cyclic permutations of @xmath26 .",
    "the _ ladder operators _ are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "they have the property that for any angular momentum eigenfunction @xmath29 with eigenvalue @xmath30 , @xmath31 is zero or an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath32 , and correspondingly for spin . the _ parity operator _ acts on wavefunctions as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the position and spin coordinate of electron @xmath15 .",
    "the simultaneous diagonalization of the ls operators is greatly simplified by representation theory using clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "specifically , the required computational cost is reduced to the calculation of irreducible ls representation spaces ( i.e. , diagonalizing the operators ) on the @xmath0-fold antisymmetrized tensor product @xmath1 ( compare with ref .",
    "* proposition  2 ) ) .",
    "here , @xmath36 denotes an angular momentum subshell , @xmath37 in chemist s notation .",
    "an explicit realization of @xmath36 is @xmath38 with the spherical harmonics @xmath39 : @xmath40 we identify the subshell label @xmath9 with the corresponding quantum number , i.e. , @xmath41 in particular , @xmath42 .",

    "consider the case that we are only interested in representation spaces @xmath50 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 equal ( or close to ) zero .",
    "as our analysis will show , this opens up the possibility of explicitly diagonalizing   restricted to the `` central '' simultaneous @xmath3-@xmath5 eigenspace with eigenvalues @xmath73 for @xmath0 even and @xmath74 for @xmath0 odd , respectively . due to symmetry",
    ", this eigenspace also has the highest dimension ( denoted @xmath75 ) among all simultaneous @xmath3-@xmath5 eigenspaces within @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : d_un ]",
    ", we derive the asymptotic result @xmath76 thus , diagonalization restricted to this central eigenspace still requires @xmath77 operations .",
    "the reasoning and basic ingredients of our algorithm are as follows :    1 .",

    "2 .   let @xmath80 be the largest @xmath3 eigenvalue on @xmath1 and @xmath81 the corresponding eigenspace , as well as @xmath82",
    ". then @xmath83 must also be an @xmath4 eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath84 .",
    "this follows from the identity @xmath85 and the fact that @xmath86 is zero on @xmath81 since @xmath80 is  by definition  the largest @xmath3 eigenvalue .",
    "the same reasoning applies to @xmath5 and @xmath6 restricted to @xmath81 .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath83 is also a @xmath5-@xmath6 eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "3 .   starting from @xmath83 , we may span an irreducible ls representation space @xmath89 by repeatedly applying the lowering operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "that is , @xmath90 .",
    "we obtain all remaining irreducible representation spaces by iteratively applying steps 2 and 3 to the orthogonal complement of @xmath89 in @xmath1 .",
    "note that although the underlying hilbert space is complex , all steps involve real - valued matrix representations of the operators @xmath91 only .",
    "thus , the whole algorithm can be implemented on the real numbers .",
    "enumerate the simultaneous eigenvalues of @xmath3 and @xmath5 acting on @xmath1 , including multiplicities , and store them in a table denoted @xmath92 .",
