    "since the pioneering works of carelli et al@xcite and oppenlnder et al@xcite , a lot of work has been devoted to the development of superconducting quantum interference filters ( sqifs ) for sensitive absolute magnetometry or for rf applications . indeed ,",
    "since the response of the sqif is non - periodic in magnetic field , there is no need of a feed - back loop to maintain a fixed functioning point",
    ". not only the absolute value of the magnetic field can be therefore measured , but the band - width of the device is not limited by the feed - back electronics anymore ( typically a few mhz usually @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , one can chose the arrangement of the squids in the array to match the impedance of the device to the read - out system .",
    "this paves the way for rf applications of sqifs , such as compact low noise amplifiers and sub - wavelength broad band antennas ( for a review see mukhanov et al@xcite ) . in the recent years , different architectures and geometries of sqifs",
    "have been explored , 1d in series and parallel configuration @xcite , 2d in series / parallel configurations @xcite , using conventional squids and bi - squids@xcite to obtain the best performances in terms of sensitivity , linearity and noise . for high - frequency applications ,",
    "very interesting results have been obtained such as 8 - 15 ghz antennas in the near field@xcite , and rf amplifiers in the 12 ghz range@xcite .",
    "these performances have been obtained using low @xmath2 materials , mainly nb , operating at liquid - he temperature .",
    "a lot of applications can not afford the related costly and power consuming cryogenics which is needed in that case .",
    "high @xmath2 superconductors ( htsc ) such as @xmath0(ybco ) appear therefore as promising candidates to make sqifs operating at high temperature , easily accessible with compact and low energy consumption cryocoolers .",
    "htsc sqifs have been fabricated for dc magnetometry applications @xcite and rf ones@xcite , using mainly bicrystal grain - boundary jj . by construction",
    "they all lie on the same line , which put stringent constraint on the circuit design .",
    "if 1d arrays can be easily realized , it is more challenging to achieve a high performance 2d htsc sqif along a geometrically one - dimensional grain boundary @xcite .",
    "an alternative technology to make large arrays of htsc squids is the irradiation technique developed by the san diego group@xcite , and more recently by bergeal et al@xcite . starting from a commercial ybco film , the circuit and the jj are patterned by ion - irradiation through photoresist masks .",
    "the induced defects within the htsc material lower the @xmath2 locally to fabricate sns ( superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ) jj , and make it insulating at high fluence to draw the circuit . superconducting devices such as thz josephson mixers were recently realized by this method@xcite .",
    "large 2d arrays of jj@xcite and sqifs@xcite have been developed successfully .    in this article",
    ", we present the properties of sqifs made by ion irradiation , and explain the emergence of an optimal operating point ( bias current and temperature ) .",
    "a deep understanding of the operation of sqif devices is necessary for future performance improvement .",
    "for that , the first step is to figure out how a single squid made by ion irradiation works , since it is the key element of sqifs .",
    "we performed numerical simulations to describe the characteristics of single squids that we measured experimentally .",
    "we then extended them to a small series sqif , and drew conclusions about its optimal working point , and its sensitivity to dispersion in junction characteristics .",
    "finally , a 2000 squid in series sqif is presented with a transfer function in the @xmath3 range .",
    "in this study , we used commercial 150 nm thick ybco films in - situ covered by a 100 nm gold layer@xcite . to start with",
    ", the latter is removed from the surface of the sample with the exception of the contact pads .",
    "the superconducting circuit is created by a first @xmath4 oxygen ions irradiation at a fluence of @xmath5 performed through a patterned photoresist . @xmath6",
    "wide slits located across superconducting microbridges are then patterned in a pmma resist by e - beam lithography .",
    "a second oxygen ions irradiation at lower fluence ( typically @xmath7 ) is performed to locally decrease @xmath2 and create sns jjs .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows optical pictures of different devices such as a single squid ( a ) , a 2000 loops series sqif ( b ) and an array of 18 squids in series that can be measured individually ( c ) .",
    "the first two devices were achieved on one chip and the last one , on another substrate .",
    "details of the fabrication process can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that same irradiation conditions were kept for all devices .",
    "moreover design does not include large flux focussing areas around the loops or any transformers .",

    "( b ) sqif with 2000 squids in series , with @xmath8 wide branches and areas ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( @xmath9=4.9 to 22 ph ) .",
    "( c ) 18 squids in series with @xmath8 wide branches and areas ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( @xmath9=5.1 to 13.3 ph ) .",
    "the first two devices ( a ) and ( b ) were realized on a same chip and the ( c ) on another one . ]    under such conditions , josephson coupling occurs at around @xmath14 , and extends over typically @xmath15 ( see figure  [ figure2 ] ( a ) for a single squid ) .",
    "below , a flux flow regime takes place , for temperatures smaller than the critical temperature of the irradiated part called @xmath16 .",
    "all measurements presented here were done in a magnetically unshielded pulse - tube cryocooler .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the sample by an external helmoltz coil system .",
    "we choose to not use a magnetic shield in order to explore the effect of a real environment on devices .",
    "first , we measured the resistance of the device as a function of temperature as depicted in figure [ figure2].a .",
    "the device exhibited two distinct superconducting transitions at 88k and 73k .",
    "the highest transition refers to that of the electrodes ( the same as the unprocessed film ) and the second to @xmath17 , below which the josephson regime starts .",
    "we then measured the i - v characteristics for the squid , shown in figure [ figure2].b in zero magnetic field ( b=0 ) and for several temperatures . in the josephson regime ,",
    "i - v characteristics of the squid follow a modified resistively shunted junction ( rsj ) model , with a non - linear normal state resistance @xmath18@xcite , where @xmath19 is the bias current , @xmath20 the resistance in the regular rsj model @xcite , and @xmath21 is a parameter determined by fitting the experimental data .",
    "given the rather high operation temperature @xmath22 , thermal smearing has to be taken into account in the fit through the parameter @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the squid critical current for b=0 , @xmath25 the flux quantum and @xmath26 the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "fits of the i - v characteristics ( see figure  [ figure2 ] ( b ) ) give access to @xmath20 and @xmath24 , and therefore to the @xmath27 product which has a dome shape as a function of temperature@xcite ( see figure  [ figure2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this is an essential feature of htsc jj made by ion irradiation .",
    "this shape is due to specific dependences of the critical current and the normal resistance versus temperature .",
    "indeed , @xmath20 decreases linearly with temperature to reach a null value at @xmath16 ( the intrinsic critical temperature of the irradiated part ) and @xmath24 increases quadratically with temperature : this leads to a maxima of the @xmath27 product .",
    ", @xmath28 and @xmath16 ( see text ) and the @xmath27 product ( extreme left scale ) showing a pronounced dome shape . the resistance @xmath20 ( see main text )",
    "is reported for @xmath29 .",

    ", width=415 ]    figure  [ figure3 ] ( a ) shows typical voltage modulations of the squid as a function of an applied magnetic field @xmath30 measured in an unshielded environment for different temperatures . from these v - b curves , we extracted the evolution of the transfer function @xmath31 as a function of bias current ( figure  [ figure3 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "as expected , all the curves show a peak in @xmath32 at a bias current approximately equal to the noise - free critical current determined by the screening parameter @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the loop inductance ) for @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this comes from the existence of thermal fluctuations which allow the squid to display a voltage modulation in magnetic field for bias currents lower than its critical current .",
    "@xmath36-@xmath30 curves recorded for several temperatures allowed us to extract the evolution of @xmath32 as a function of temperature .",
    "a particularity is the presence of a maximum in temperature for @xmath32 at @xmath37 . to get more insight on this behavior , we compared our data with semi - empirical formulae given by koelle et al@xcite and enpuku et al@xcite , and with numerical simulations of the rsj model .",
    "we performed numerical simulations starting from the fit of the i - v curves with the modified rsj model ( see above ) to extract @xmath20 and @xmath24 for different temperatures .",
    "we used the inductex software to calculate the inductance of the squid which includes geometric ( @xmath9 ) and kinetic inductance ( @xmath38 ) since for these temperature this latter is not negligible anymore .",
    "@xmath38 depends on the superconducting penetration depth @xmath39 , which varies with temperature according to the gorter - casimir formula @xcite : @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "all parameters are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the resulting @xmath32 is shown in figure [ figure3 ] ( b ) , in very good agreement with experimental data as well as a function of the bias current than as a function of temperature .",
    ".parameters used for the simulations .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the quite unusual behavior in temperature of @xmath32 is well reproduced in our simulations .",
    "in fact , this comes from the non - monotonic variation of the @xmath27 product with temperature as mentioned above . in figure",
    "[ figure4 ] , we plotted @xmath32 measured at optimum current ( which is temperature dependent ) as a function of temperature , and compared to our simulations and to the semi - empirical formulae . on the same graph",
    "are also reported the @xmath27 product with its characteristics dome shape , and the value of @xmath44 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath32 at 67 - 68 k comes from the convolution of @xmath27 ( maximum at 66 - 67 k ) with the decreasing @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath45 for small @xmath44@xcite , as seen in the koelle s and enpuku s formulae .",
    "enpuku s expression describes correctly the experimental results in a restricted high temperature region , while the koelle s one and our simulations do it on the full range .",
    "an important message here is that the optimum working point in current and temperature for the squid corresponds to @xmath46 as marked by the dashed green arrow in figure  [ figure4 ] , and not for @xmath47 .",
    "for all squids that we measured , the optimum as well as for @xmath32 than for @xmath48 is reached for high @xmath44 value .",
    "this seems to be inherent to squids made by ion irradiation .     as a function of the bias current for different temperatures .",

    ", width=453 ]",
    "sqifs are very promising devices for sensitive magnetometry , since their performance scale with the number of squids ( linearly for the series configuration ) .",
    "however , the collective behavior is complex , since relevant parameters such as @xmath44 vary with the loop size on the one hand , and since deviations from the canonical fully symmetric squid and the dispersion in individual squids characteristics are unavoidable on the other hand . as a result , optimization of the array is not straightforward , and one would benefit from a thorough investigation of its detailed operation . on the way of making sqifs with thousands squids ,",
    "we designed a 18 squids sqif in a series configuration with loop sizes ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath49 ( @xmath9 from 5.1 to 13.3 ph ) , where the squids can be measured individually ( see figure  [ figure1 ] ( c ) ) . for the whole device , we recorded the @xmath50 curves .",
    "as depicted in the figure [ figure5a ] ( a ) , a sqif response is observed .",
    "it is weak , since the number of squids is moderate , but clearly seen , with an amplitude @xmath51 at the maximum . from v - b curves",
    ", we then extracted the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ figure5a ] ( b ) shows @xmath32 as a function of the bias current for different temperatures ( similar results are obtained for @xmath53 ) .",
    "the overall picture is similar to that of a single squid , with an optimum bias current for each temperature , and an optimum temperature at t=56k ( this device displays a josephson regime at temperatures lowers than the two others devices presented ) . to explain this behavior , we numerically modeled the v - b characteristics of a device with the same geometry as the experimental one .",
    "we first simulated an array where all the jj were identical .",
    "we used characteristics from a typical individual squid ( namely @xmath20 , @xmath24 and @xmath21 for different temperatures ) and computed the sqif response by summing the contribution of the squids with different loop sizes .",
    "we knowingly neglected mutual inductive coupling between squids , since the distance between nearest neighbors ( @xmath54 is large enough .",
    "we also took into account the temperature dependence of both @xmath44 and @xmath55 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ figure5a ] ( c ) displaying @xmath32 as a function of the current bias for different temperatures .",
    "there is a clear discrepancy with experimental data , with a restricted range in current where the sqif behavior can be observed , and an optimum temperature lower than the one experimentally obtained .",
    "we then introduced a dispersion in the jj characteristics ( @xmath56 in @xmath24 and in @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is equal to the standard deviation divided by the mean for a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "recent statistical studies of ion - irradiated jj in a pb - shielded cryostat lead to a typical dispersion of @xmath59 , while our measurements in unshielded environment show that dispersion varies from @xmath60 to roughly @xmath61 depending on the temperature@xcite .",
    "we therefore used an upper bound estimate in our simulations .    .",
    "( b ) measured transfer function @xmath32 as a function of bias current for different temperatures for the 18 squids sqif .",
    "( c ) calculated transfer function as a function of bias current for different temperatures , without dispersion in the jj characteristics",
    "( c ) idem with a dispersion in characteristics of @xmath61 ( see main text ) .",
    "( d ) , width=453 ]    by introducing a dispersion in jj characteristics , we can notice ( figure  [ figure5a ] ( d ) ) that the range in bias current where the sqif voltage modulation is observed is larger at low temperatures but tends to be reduced at higher temperatures .",
    "besides , a clear optimum occurs in temperature .",
    "it is worth noting that the optimal temperature is shifted toward higher temperature as compared to the case of null dispersion , and corresponds to that experimentally measured .",
    "moreover , presence of dispersion tends to decrease the transfer function as compared to the ideal case .",
    "these results are consistent with computations and experiments reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "to explain this behavior , it is necessary to come back to the behavior of the individual squids .",
    "figure  [ figure6 ] shows the transfer functions vs bias current for 18 squids with different characteristics for two temperatures : 50k , panel ( a ) and 56 k , panel ( c ) .",
    "figures [ figure6 ] ( b ) and ( d ) depict @xmath32 plotted as a function of the normalized current @xmath62 for each temperature .",
    "these two temperatures correspond to two different squid working regimes . at low temperature ( i.e. 50k ) , for a given current , only a very small fraction of squids works together which impedes the existence of a sqif voltage modulation . by increasing the temperature ,",
    "the overlap of voltage modulation of squids is more important raising the number of squids working together .",
    "thus , a sqif behavior can be observed with a well - defined voltage modulation .",
    "the reason is the following . at low temperatures",
    ", @xmath44 is large and the thermal parameter @xmath55 small for all squids .",
    "that means that each squid displays a voltage modulation in magnetic field in a restricted current range centered around its critical current ( figure [ figure6 ] ( b ) ) . in the presence of dispersion in jj characteristics ,",
    "the different squids in the array will have distinct optimal currents and thus a collective behavior of the array is strongly disadvantaged .",
    "moreover , even if the transfer function of individual squids is higher at low temperature , the potential sqif response will be moderate , and will decrease with decreasing temperature , since fewer and fewer squids contribute . on the contrary , at high temperature , each squid displays a voltage modulation in magnetic field on an extended range of current centered around its critical current , which leads to a collective behavior of the array .",
    "for a given current , the situation with squids operating in low - beta regime favors the contribution of many squids to the sqif response , but the amplitude of each squid voltage modulation being smaller at high temperature , @xmath32 decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "( see main text ) .",
    "( left panels ) computed @xmath32 as a function of the bias current at two different temperatures : ( a ) 50k and ( c ) 56k .",
    "in the former case @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and in the latter one @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "( right panels ) same data normalized by @xmath24 .",
    "the peak at low temperature is narrower than the one at high temperature . ,",
    "width=453 ]     dispersion in the jj characteristics for symmetric squids ( pink line ) , and with in addition @xmath61 asymmetry in the critical currents of the two jj in each squids ( black line).,width=453 ]    this is why an optimum in temperature is observed as summarized in figure  [ figure5b ] , where both experimental data and simulations with , and without dispersion are shown .",
    "we can go one step further and include an asymmetry in the critical currents of the jj in single squids .",
    "it is worthwhile reminding that an asymmetry in the critical current of the squid is equivalent to a non - zero magnetic field within the squid loop .",
    "we introduced a @xmath61 difference in the critical currents for all squids in our simulations , corresponding to the measured dispersion for single jj@xcite .",
    "the result is the curve shown in figure  [ figure5b ] ( black solid line ) , a bit closer to our experimental data . in the same spirit of the previous arguments",
    ", asymmetry will impair the collective behavior at low temperature when few squids contribute to the sqif response .",
    "moreover , the shift in v - b curves of squid has more dramatic effect in this situation .",
    "individual squids do not respond simultaneously , which leads to the the reduction , or even the disappearance of the sqif voltage modulation .",
    "this effect is less deleterious at high temperature . as a consequence",
    ", a more pronounced optimal temperature appears in the presence of asymmetry in critical current . experimentally",
    ", since we perform our experiment in an unshielded environment to stay close to the real applications of sqifs , we can not distinguish between potential asymmetry in jj characteristics and uncontrolled stray fields which would have the same effect on the sqif response .    as a summary ,",
    "these results and their analysis based on our rsj simulations show that sqif effect in our devices is quite robust against dispersion in jj characteristics and asymmetries .",
    "nevertheless , dispersion acts on the operating point by shifting it toward high temperature and low bias current .",
    "we made series arrays of 2000 squids with loop sizes ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( @xmath9=4.9 to 22 ph ) and @xmath8 wide branches to make a sqif ( see figure  [ figure1 ] ( b ) ) , which operates between 65k and 75k .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath67 as a function of bias current for different temperatures are reported in figure  [ figure7 ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively , and display optimum operating conditions as ( see figure  [ figure7 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "this is coherent with previous experiment and simulations reported above .",
    "the optimum temperature in both cases is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "these numbers compare favorably with previous reports in the literature . using the ion - irradiation technique , cybart _ et al _",
    "reported @xmath71 and @xmath72 for 280 squids @xcite .",
    "oppenlnder and co - workers using grain - boundary htsc jj published @xmath32 values between @xmath73 and @xmath74 and a @xmath67 in the @xmath75 range for 100 - 200 squids in series@xcite .",

    "two low - noise amplifiers ( noise level @xmath81 ) were used in parallel , and only the correlated noise has been measured .",
    "the obtained spectrum ( figure [ figure8 ] ) exhibits @xmath82 noise rising up at rather low frequency , namely below @xmath83 .",
    "such a value has been achieved with high @xmath2 devices only by using bias reversal techniques@xcite .",
    "neither bias - reversal nor flux - locked loop electronics were used here .",
    "the sqif displays a white voltage noise level of @xmath84 , in good agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite . taking into account the obtained transfer function value @xmath69 for the bare sqif ( with no transformer )",
    ", the voltage noise level can be translated into a magnetic field sensitivity of @xmath85 .",
    "values found in the literature are generally lower@xcite .",
    "however , the comparison is limited since the number of squids involved is more than an order of magnitude different , and the total impedance of the system is very different as well .",
    "based on these results , an optimization of the sqif design is being made to achieve better performances .     vs frequency f of a 2000 squids in series - sqif .",
    "the sqif is operated at 72 k inside an unshielded cryostat .",
    "the peaks at @xmath86 50 hz and higher harmonics are due to the grid .",
    ", width=377 ]",
    "both htsc squids and sqifs made by ion - irradiation present an optimum operating point in bias current and temperature .",
    "the specific dome like temperature dependence of the @xmath87 product is important to understand the maximum in temperature .",
    "the sqif behavior is more complex to analyze .",
    "our simulations based on the rsj model enable us to qualitatively reproduce our experimental results on small sqif in a unshielded environment , provided we introduce a dispersion in the individual squids characteristics , coming from differences in jj or from uncontrolled magnetic fields . both spread and high temperatures favor a sqif response from many squids , but with a small amplitude , while low temperature operation provides larger amplitudes but on a limited number of squids .",
    "this is the main reason for the optimum operating point observed .",
    "finally , the 2000 squids in series sqif displays interesting features in an unshielded environment , such as sensitivity in the @xmath3 range and a low noise level .",
    "these performances look promising for the realization of performing htsc sqifs .",

    "<S> superconducting quantum interference filters ( sqifs ) are arrays of superconducting loops of different sizes including josephson junctions ( jj ) . for a random distribution of sizes </S>",
    "<S> , they present a non - periodic response to an applied magnetic field , with a large transfer function and a magnetic field sensitivity potentially improved with respect to that of a single squid . </S>",
    "<S> such properties make sqifs interesting devices to detect the magnetic component of electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the highly scalable technique of ion irradiation to make squids and sqifs based on commercial @xmath0films , and studied their properties . </S>",
    "<S> both display optimum performances as a function of temperature and bias current , that can be understood in the frame of numerical simulations that we developed . </S>",
    "<S> the role of asymmetries and dispersion in jj characteristics ( routinely found in high tc superconductors technologies ) is also studied . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that both do not impede the existence of a sqif effect but play a role on the emergence of the optimal point . </S>",
    "<S> we finally present results on sqif made with 2000 squid in series , showing a transfer function @xmath1 . </S>"
