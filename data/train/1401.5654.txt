    "`` once upon a time , there was a group of seven or eight beginning graduate students who decided they should learn algebraic geometry .",
    "they were going to do it the traditional way , by reading hartshorne s book and solving some of the exercises there ; but one of them , who was a bit more experienced than the others , said to his friends : ` i heard that a famous professor in algebraic geometry is coming here soon ; why do nt we ask him for advice . '",
    "well , the famous professor turned out to be a very nice person , and offered to help them with their reading course . in the end , four out of the seven became his graduate students  and they are very grateful for the time that the famous professor spent with them ! ''",
    "the purpose of this article is to give a short proof of the hodge - theoretic part of viehweg s weak positivity theorem .",
    "[ thm : viehweg ] let @xmath0 be an algebraic fiber space , meaning a surjective morphism with connected fibers between two smooth complex projective algebraic varieties . then for any @xmath1 , the sheaf @xmath2 is weakly positive .",
    "the notion of weak positivity was introduced by viehweg , as a kind of birational version of being nef .",
    "we begin by recalling the  somewhat cumbersome  definition .",
    "let @xmath3 be a torsion - free coherent sheaf on a smooth algebraic variety @xmath4 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath5 the @xmath6-th symmetric power of @xmath3 , and by @xmath7 its reflexive hull .",
    "a more concrete definition is that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the inclusion of the maximal open subset over which @xmath3 is locally free .",
    "the formula holds because the complement has codimension at least two in @xmath4 .    a torsion - free coherent sheaf @xmath3 is _ weakly positive _ on an open subset @xmath10 if , for every ample line bundle @xmath11 on @xmath4 , and for every @xmath12 , the restriction morphism @xmath13 is surjective for all sufficiently large @xmath14 .",
    "if we think of @xmath15 as being the @xmath16-th symmetric power of the ( non - existent ) object @xmath17 , then the definition means the following : after tensoring @xmath3 by an arbitrarily small fraction of an ample line bundle , all sufficiently large symmetric powers are generated over @xmath18 by their global sections .",
    "weak positivity on @xmath4 is equivalent to nefness . for line bundles , being weakly positive",
    "is the same thing as being pseudo - effective .",
    "the most notable application of the weak positivity theorem is viehweg s proof of the iitaka conjecture over a base of general type .",
    "let @xmath0 be an algebraic fiber space , with general fiber @xmath19 ; iitaka s conjecture predicts that @xmath20 viehweg proved the conjecture when @xmath21 is of general type .",
    "roughly speaking , he uses the weak positivity of @xmath2 , together with the fact that @xmath22 is big , to produce sufficiently many global sections of @xmath23 .",
    "they survey article @xcite contains a nicely written account of these matters .      the idea of using methods from hodge theory to prove the positivity of certain sheaves goes back at least to fujita and kawamata .",
    "to put viehweg s theorem in context , let me briefly mention a few other positivity theorems for the direct image of @xmath24 and its powers :    1 .",
    "kawamata @xcite proved that if the fiber space @xmath0 is `` nice '' , then @xmath25 is locally free and nef .",
    "nice means , roughly speaking , that the singularities of @xmath26 should occur over a normal crossing divisor , and that the local monodromy should be unipotent .",
    "the proof uses hodge theory .",
    "2 .   viehweg deduced from kawamata s result that @xmath25 is always weakly positive ; by studying certain well - chosen branched coverings of @xmath4 , he obtained the same result for @xmath2 with @xmath27 .",
    "kollr gave a simpler proof of viehweg s theorem using his vanishing theorem for higher direct images of dualizing sheaves .",
    "4 .   earlier this year",
    ", fujino , fujisawa , and saito @xcite proved a general nefness theorem for mixed hodge modules that has kawamata s theorem as a special case .",
    "there are many other results of this type ; the list above contains only those that are most closely related to the topic of this paper .",
    "let @xmath28 be a polarizable variation of hodge structure on a the complement of a divisor @xmath29 in a smooth projective algebraic variety @xmath4 , and let @xmath30 be the largest integer for which the hodge bundle @xmath31 is nontrivial .",
    "the general philosophy that emerges from kawamata s work @xcite is that @xmath31 extends in a canonical way to a nef vector bundle on @xmath4 , provided that @xmath29 is a normal crossing divisor and @xmath28 has unipotent local monodromy .",
    "( without these assumptions , there are examples @xcite*remark  4.6(v ) where nefness fails . )",
    "the analogy with viehweg s theorem suggests that , without these assumptions , there should still be a canonical extension of @xmath31 that is weakly positive .",
    "this expectation turns out to be correct , if one takes for the extension of @xmath32 the one given by saito s theory of mixed hodge modules .",
    "here is the result , proved in collaboration with mihnea popa .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath33 be a mixed hodge module on a smooth complex projective variety @xmath4 .",
    "if the underlying filtered @xmath34-module satisfies @xmath35 , then the coherent sheaf @xmath36 is weakly positive on the open subset where @xmath33 is a variation of mixed hodge structure .",
    "viehweg s theorem ( in the case @xmath37 ) is an immediate consequence .",
    "given a morphism @xmath0 as in , we let @xmath33 be the direct image of the trivial hodge module on @xmath4 ; to be precise , @xmath38 , in saito s notation . setting @xmath39 , it can be shown that @xmath40 and implies that this sheaf is weakly positive on the smooth locus of @xmath26 .",
    "the weak positivity of @xmath2 for @xmath27 follows as in viehweg s original argument by considering certain branched coverings of @xmath4 .",
    "although it looks more general , is not really a new result , because it could be deduced from kawamata s theorem .",
    "the point of presenting it is that mixed hodge modules appear to be the natural setting : as we will see towards the end of the talk , the proof of the theorem is extremely short",
    ". this may be only of academic interest in this case , where we are basically reproving an existing result  but in other situations , the use of mixed hodge modules may allow us to go much further than existing methods .    before explaining the proof of",
    ", i would like to say a few words about mixed hodge modules and their applications to algebraic geometry ; i will also try to motivate their use with a specific example . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "let me concentrate on the case of pure hodge modules .",
    "hodge modules are a generalization of variations of hodge structure . for applications to algebraic geometry",
    ", the essential features of a variation of hodge structure @xmath41 are the following :    1 .",
    "a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath28 with a flat connection @xmath42 ; 2 .   a hodge filtration @xmath43 by holomorphic subbundles , subject to the relation @xmath44 called griffith transversality ( by everyone except griffiths , who calls it the infinitesimal period relation ) .",
    "in practice , there are various pieces of additional data : a rational structure ; a polarization ; a weight filtration ( in the mixed case ) ; etc . but the vector bundles @xmath28 and @xmath43 and their properties are what matters most for algebraic geometers .",
    "variations of hodge structure are `` smooth '' objects , arising for example from families of smooth projective varieties .",
    "one can include objects with singularities by generalizing vector bundles with flat connection to @xmath34-modules .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 is a special case of a regular holonomic @xmath34-module .",
    "the connection gives rise to an action by tangent vector fields (= linear differential operators of order one ) , according to the formula @xmath46 this makes @xmath28 into a left @xmath34-module : on the one hand , @xmath47 satisfies the leibniz rule @xmath48 which amounts to the relation @xmath49 ; on the other hand , @xmath47 flat means that @xmath50 which amounts to the relation @xmath51 .",
    "this gives @xmath28 the structure of a left module over the sheaf of linear differential operators @xmath52 .",
    "the hodge filtration defines a filtration of @xmath28 that is compatible with the order of differential operators .",
    "indeed , if we set @xmath53 to get an increasing filtration , then we have @xmath54 because of griffiths transversality .",
    "the resulting @xmath34-module is regular holonomic ; its so - called characteristic variety , a subset of the cotangent bundle @xmath55 , is precisely the zero section .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that , locally on @xmath4 , solutions to the equation @xmath56 can be analytically continued in every direction .",
    "now let @xmath4 be a smooth quasi - projective variety ; hodge modules can be defined much more generally , including on singular varieties , but we shall focus on this case because it simplifies the discussion",
    ". the essential features of a hodge module are then the following :    1 .   a regular holonomic @xmath52-module @xmath57 ; 2 .   a compatible filtration @xmath58 by coherent @xmath59-submodules that is `` good '' , meaning that @xmath60 , with equality for @xmath61 .",
    "as in the case of variations of hodge structure , there are several additional pieces of data , such as a polarization ; a rational structure ( in the form of a perverse sheaf with coefficients in @xmath62 ) ; a weight filtration ( in the mixed case ) ; etc .",
    "there is also a long list of axioms that need to be satisfied in order for the pair @xmath63 to be called a hodge module .",
    "a basic fact is that every variation of hodge structure defines a hodge module ; we saw already more or less how this works . in the other direction ,",
    "every hodge module is generically a variation of hodge structure .    in the situation of",
    ", there is a zariski - open subset over which @xmath33 is a variation of mixed hodge structure . under",
    "the indexing conventions explained above , the condition @xmath35 translates into @xmath64 , and the coherent sheaf @xmath36 in the theorem is an extension of the hodge bundle @xmath65 . note that the theorem allows the possibility that @xmath66 : in that case , @xmath67 and the assertion about weak positivity becomes trivial .      instead of boring the reader with a list of axioms ,",
    "let me motivate the use of @xmath34-modules by an example .",
    "the example is the residue description for the cohomology of hyperplane sections , something that i though about a lot for my dissertation .",
    "this is a good place to acknowledge the great influence that herb has had on my mathematical interests : i basically learned about mixed hodge modules by trying to understand some of his constructions with residues and differential operators .",
    "let @xmath4 be a smooth projective variety of dimension @xmath6 , and let @xmath68 be a smooth and very ample divisor in @xmath4 . according to the lefschetz theorems , the cohomology groups @xmath69 are determined by those of @xmath4 , with the exception of the so - called _ variable part _",
    "@xmath70 defined as the kernel of the gysin morphism . the variable part can be described very nicely by residues .",
    "we denote by @xmath71 the sheaf of meromorphic @xmath72-forms on @xmath4 that are holomorphic on @xmath73 , but may have poles along @xmath21 . by grothendieck s theorem ,",
    "the hypercohomology of the algebraic de rham complex @xmath74      \\bigl\\lbrack { { \\mathscr{o}}_x}(\\ast y ) \\rar{d } & { \\omega_x}^1(\\ast y ) \\rar{d } &          \\dotsb \\rar{d } & { \\omega_x}^n(\\ast y ) \\bigr\\rbrack      \\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ] computes @xmath75 ; this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath76 is affine . from the long exact cohomology sequence @xmath77",
    "we obtain a short exact sequence @xmath74 0 \\rar & h_0^n(x ) \\rar & h^n(x \\setminus y ) \\rar & { h_{\\mathit{ev}}}^{n-1}(y)(-1 ) \\rar & 0 \\\\ & & h^0 \\bigl ( x , { \\omega_x}^n(\\ast y ) \\bigr ) \\uar       \\arrow[swap , bend right=30,start anchor={[yshift=0.8ex]}]{ur}{\\operatorname{res}_y } \\end{tikzcd}\\ ] ] the arrow labeled @xmath78 is the so - called _ residue mapping _ ; under our assumptions on @xmath21 , it is surjective .",
    "carlson and griffiths @xcite have shown that , if the line bundle @xmath79 is sufficiently ample , then the hodge filtration on @xmath80 is the filtration by pole order .",
    "more precisely , their result is that @xmath81 is surjective . for @xmath82 ,",
    "this recovers the familiar fact that @xmath83 is generated by residues of logarithmic @xmath6-forms on @xmath4 .",
    "the result of carlson and griffiths also works in families .",
    "let @xmath11 be a very ample line bundle on @xmath4 , and let @xmath84 denote the linear system of its sections .",
    "each point @xmath85 corresponds to a hypersurface @xmath86 ; we denote by @xmath87 the set of points where @xmath88 is smooth , and by @xmath89 the inclusion .",
    "let @xmath90 be the incidence variety .",
    "just as above , we can use residues to express the variable part in the variation of hodge structure @xmath91 ; more precisely , what we get is a description of the underlying flat vector bundle @xmath92 and the hodge filtration @xmath93 on it .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the description from above can also tell us something about singular hypersurfaces .",
    "the answer is that we can use residues to construct a natural extension of the bundle @xmath28 from @xmath94 to all of @xmath95 ; this idea is due to herb clemens .",
    "suppose for a moment that we have a relative @xmath6-form @xmath96 with poles along @xmath97 , defined over an open subset of the form @xmath98 .",
    "at each point @xmath99 , the hypersurface @xmath88 is smooth , and so we have a well - defined residue @xmath100 in this way , we obtain a holomorphic section of the bundle @xmath101 over the open set @xmath102 ; for simplicity , we shall denote it by the symbol @xmath103 .",
    "we can then define a subsheaf @xmath104 by the following rule : its sections over an open subset @xmath102 are given by @xmath105 it has a natural filtration @xmath58 by pole order , defined as follows : @xmath106",
    "the point is that we consider only those sections of @xmath107 that are the residue of a meromorphic form with poles along @xmath97 ; note that the meromorphic form needs to be defined on all of @xmath18 , including over points of @xmath108 .",
    "this makes sense because the incidence variety @xmath97 is actually a smooth hypersurface in @xmath109 .",
    "provided that the line bundle @xmath11 is sufficiently ample , the theorem of carlson and griffiths from above shows that we have @xmath110    now @xmath57 is naturally a left @xmath111-module : differential operators on @xmath95 act by differentiating the coefficients of @xmath112 .",
    "more precisely , given a vector field @xmath113 , let @xmath114 denote the obvious lifting to the product ; then if @xmath115 , we can take the lie derivative and define @xmath116 concretely , this means that we contract @xmath117 with @xmath118 , and then take the residue of the resulting relative @xmath6-form .",
    "it is easy to see that the filtration @xmath58 is compatible with the order of differential operators ",
    "after all , differentiating @xmath72 times will increase the order of the pole by @xmath72 .",
    "one can also compute the characteristic variety @xmath119 and prove in this way that @xmath57 is holonomic .",
    "the characteristic variety turns out to be closely related to the set @xmath120 of singular points in the fibers of @xmath121 ; this is not surprising , because those are exactly the points where one can not take a residue in the classical sense .",
    "both @xmath97 and @xmath122 are projective bundles over @xmath4 , of dimension @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively ; they naturally embed into the projectivization of @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath126 , then the characteristic variety of @xmath57 is given by @xmath127 in particular , both components of @xmath119 are of dimension @xmath128 , which means that @xmath57 is holonomic .",
    "one can show that @xmath129 is part of a hodge module on @xmath95 that naturally extends the variation of hodge structure @xmath101 .",
    "you can find the details in the paper @xcite ; the key point in the proof is that the incidence variety @xmath97 is smooth .",
    "the message to take away from this is that hodge modules are the correct generalization of variations of hode structure .",
    "indeed , here we have one example where we get a natural extension of a variation of hodge structure ( with the help of residues )   and it turns out that the extension is precisely the same as the one given by saito s theory !",
    "i should add that i have found this particular example to be very useful for learning about mixed hodge modules .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to the proof of .",
    "the proof closely follows kollr s , but we replace certain geometric arguments by abstract results about mixed hodge modules . as i have said before , i do not claim that this proof is in any way simpler than the original one ; only that it is shorter , and therefore perhaps better suited for generalizations .",
    "the main ingredient is the following vanishing theorem for the first nonzero sheaf in the hodge filtration of a mixed hodge module @xcite*theorem  1.2 .",
    "[ thm : saito ] let @xmath130 be the filtered @xmath34-module underlying a mixed hodge module on a smooth projective variety @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath35 , then @xmath131 for every @xmath132 and every ample line bundle @xmath11 on @xmath4 .",
    "the vanishing theorem implies that @xmath133 is @xmath134-regular ( in the sense of castelnuovo - mumford ) , and therefore always globally generated ( here and below , @xmath135 ) . to prove that @xmath36 is weakly positive",
    ", we have to find a way to raise the term @xmath36 in the formula to a large power . in kollr s",
    "proof , this is accomplished by considering the fiber product @xmath136 ; it requires some analysis of the singularities .",
    "we shall replace this geometric argument by the following abstract result about mixed hodge modules .",
    "next , we recall a useful lemma about restriction to submanifolds ; it appears in @xcite*lemma  2.17 .",
    "the symbol @xmath137 in the statement refers to a certain pullback operation on mixed hodge modules ( in the derived category ) ; the precise definition does not matter for our purposes .",
