    "ionized gas is commonly used to determine chemical compositions and study the enrichment of heavy elements throughout the universe . to convert the observed line intensities into ionic abundances ,",
    "the electron temperature and density are normally required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , the line intensities used to measure the electron density and temperature as well as determine the chemical composition are collisionally - excited forbidden lines of common heavy elements ( carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , neon , sulfur , and argon ) .",
    "though challenging because they are weak , recombination lines may also be used to determine chemical abundances , as was first attempted by @xcite .",
    "invariably , the abundances derived from recombination lines are larger than those derived from collisionally - excited lines , at least for carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and neon @xcite , leading to what is known as the abundance discrepancy .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provide recent reviews .",
    "the ratio of abundances derived from optical recombination lines ( orls ) and collisionally - excited lines ( cels ) is known as the abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) .",
    "the adf is found in both planetary nebulae and regions .",
    "@xcite emphasize that the nature of the adf is , possibly , different in regions , where it is almost always near a factor of two , and in planetary nebulae , where much larger values are encountered about 20% of the time . in both regions and planetary nebulae ,",
    "the adfs for carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and neon tend to be similar for a given object , i.e. , element ratios such as @xmath1 are unaffected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "attempts to explain the adf phenomenon have focused mainly upon the appropriate temperature to use when deriving abundances and the effects of deviations about some mean temperature .",
    "@xcite first noted that the use of a single temperature derived from collisionally - excited forbidden lines was likely to overestimate the true mean temperature and underestimate the ionic abundances subsequently derived .",
    "taking temperature fluctuations into account allows , in many cases , to reconcile the abundances derived from cels and orls ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , inspired by the unusually large adf found for ngc 6153 , argued that a second plasma component , consisting of cold , hydrogen - deficient clumps , embedded in the normal nebular material was a more natural explanation .",
    "other ideas have been less explored , but include enhanced radiative or dielectronic recombination and departures of the electron energy distribution from the maxwellian distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust discs around the central stars are another possibility @xcite .",
    "finally , detailed observations of the orion nebula indicate that density structures , such as proplyds or shocks , can distort the electron temperatures and densities derived from cels if not taken into account @xcite .",
    "there are several means to determine the electron temperature in ionized plasmas ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the result s sensitivity to the underlying temperature and any variations will depend upon the ion used , the conditions in which it is found , and the means by which the transitions are excited .",
    "the most commonly - used temperatures are determined from cels , the balmer jump , and the ratio of orls .",
    "the intensity of cels have an exponential dependence upon the electron temperature that characterizes the maxwellian distribution of the kinetic energy of the free electrons .",
    "since temperature measurements depend upon the ratio of two such lines , the result will also have an exponential dependence upon temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the intensity of orls usually have a power law dependence upon the temperature , @xmath2 with typically @xmath3",
    ". ratios of orls will therefore have only a weak power law dependence upon the temperature .",
    "the balmer jump depends upon temperature as @xmath4 , so the temperature , based upon the ratio of a balmer line to the balmer jump , has an approximately square root dependence upon temperature .    as might be expected as a result of the temperature structure in any given object",
    ", the different temperatures do not always agree .",
    "in general , the temperatures derived from cels are the highest , followed by balmer jump temperatures , and with temperatures derived from orls of neutral helium or ionized oxygen being the coldest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using hotter temperatures to derive chemical abundances from orls helps reconcile them with the abundances determined from cels .",
    "obviously , meaningful ionic abundances are obtained only if the electron temperature is appropriate for the emitting ions .",
    "much effort has been invested in searching for trends between the adf and the nebular properties in the hope of uncovering the adf s origin . in planetary nebulae ,",
    "the adf increases as the difference between the balmer jump and [ ] @xmath54363,4959,5007 temperatures increases @xcite .",
    "likewise , the adf increases in planetary nebulae that are larger , more diffuse , and of lower surface brightness , but not with expansion velocity , electron temperature , @xmath6 ratio , or the stellar temperature or luminosity @xcite .",
    "the trends with size , density , and surface brightness could suggest that part of the adf phenomenon in planetary nebulae has to do with the evolutionary stage .",
    "@xcite find trends with opposite signs between the electron temperature ( cels ) and abundances of oxygen derived from orls and cels , finding high recombination line abundances in regions that are more highly ionized and of higher electron temperature . in regions ,",
    "there may be weak correlations between increasing adf and an increasing difference between the balmer jump and [ ] @xmath54363,4959,5007 temperatures and with increasing excitation energy , but , within observational uncertainties , no correlation has been found with the abundance of oxygen or of doubly ionized oxygen , the ionization degree , nebular temperatures , the width of the hydrogen lines , or the effective temperature of the main ionizing stars @xcite .    here",

    "@xcite attempted to observe the temperature fluctuations postulated by @xcite using imaging and spectroscopy from the hubble space telescope .",
    "this is a difficult endeavor , as any observation will necessarily average the temperature structure along the line of sight to some extent , even at high spectral resolution because of doppler broadening and the consequent mixing from plasma at different positions ( or velocities ) can not be avoided .",

    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite provide an enlightening study , though for a different context ( a proplyd in orion ) .    in planetary nebulae ,",
    "there are multiple ways of incorporating external material whose origin is not the progenitor star . a simple example is the sweeping up of interstellar material during the evolution of the nebular shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although this mechanism could be relevant for relatively evolved objects when the shell is optically - thin and the analysis includes swept up interstellar material , it can not explain the kinematics we find for the , , , and lines in ngc 7009 .",
    "the dust discs found around the central stars of some planetary nebulae could be a more relevant example of external material @xcite , which @xcite find may be responsible for the chemical abundances in the surrounding nebulae under some circumstances . in this scenario ,",
    "the kinematics of the orls need not coincide with those expected from ionization equilibrium , as the sublimating material will be at least partially decoupled from the nebular shell , and so could be compatible with our observations in ngc 7009 . in both cases , the external material is relevant to determine the composition of the nebular plasma , but not that of the matter ejected by the progenitor star .",
    "the foregoing has far - reaching consequences concerning nebular abundances throughout the universe .",
    "however , ngc 7009 belongs to a minority group of planetary nebulae with large adfs ( approximately 20% of the total ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that generally have densities and sizes implying that they are not very young @xcite .",
    "the frequency of planetary nebulae with dust discs is similar ( 17% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though based upon a small sample . on the other hand , most planetary nebulae and almost all regions",
    "have adfs of about a factor of 2 @xcite and it is unclear whether the adf phenomenon in these objects has the same origin as in the planetary nebulae with large adfs @xcite . clearly , it would be worthwhile further investigating the kinematics and spatial distributions of orls in objects spanning a large range in adf and nebular excitation .",
    "we analyze spatially- and velocity - resolved spectroscopy of ngc 7009 obtained with the uves spectrograph at the eso vlt ( ut2 ) to study the kinematics of its emission lines .",
    "we construct position - velocity maps for emission lines arising from different physical mechanisms and for the physical conditions .",
    "we are able to study the ionization structure for oxygen in exquisite detail : o@xmath17 via @xmath03707 , the transition zone to o@xmath13 via @xmath03444 ( bowen fluorescence ) and @xmath53757,5592 ( charge transfer ) , the o@xmath13 zone via [ ] @xmath54363,4959 ( collisional excitation ) and @xmath54639,4649 ( recombination ) , the o@xmath14 zone via [ ] @xmath53726,3729 , and the outermost h transition zone via [ ] @xmath06300 .",
    "the _ only _ anomaly is that the kinematics of the collisionally - excited [ ] @xmath54363,4959 lines does not coincide with that of the @xmath54639,4649 recombination lines . the kinematics favor at least two emission components for the @xmath54639,4649 recombination lines .",
    "the plasma from which a large fraction of the emission arises clearly does not originate within the volume expected from the viewpoint of ionization equilibrium as traced by the [ ] emission (   [ section_ionization_structure ] and [ section_location_recombination ] , fig .",
    "[ fig_pv_o2 ] ) .",
    "instead , it arises from a zone interior to it .",
    "there is also a widely - distributed plasma component , co - spatial with the collisional [ ] emission , that also gives rise to @xmath54639,4649 recombination emission .",
    "the , , and recombination lines appear to follow the distribution of the lines .",
    "( their pv diagrams are usually of lower signal - to - noise . )",
    "so , in ngc 7009 , a large fraction of the , , , and recombination emission appears to arise internal to the zone expected to contain the doubly - ionized parent ions .",
    "this result is in agreement with studies of the spatial distributions of recombination and forbidden lines ( see  [ section_location_recombination ] ) that typically find that the former are more centrally - concentrated .",
    "the kinematics of the , , , and recombination lines in ngc 7009 clearly favor a separate plasma component emitting mostly ( only ? ) in these lines . in ngc 7009",
    ", this plasma component would be metal - rich ( as opposed to h - poor ) since it is not a strong emitter in lines .",
    "we are unable to find unambiguous kinematic evidence for the existence of metal - rich clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but can not rule them out .",
    "other explanations for the origin of the , , , and lines , such as temperature fluctuations or modifications of atomic physics are either ruled out or implausible for ngc 7009 considering the kinematics we observe .",
    "the existence of multiple plasma components has very important consequences for the calculation and interpretation of chemical abundances .",
    "given the kinematics we find for ngc 7009 , the discrepant abundances inferred from forbidden and recombination lines pertain to different plasma components within the nebula . in ngc 7009",
    ", the abundance discrepancy \" arises because these plasma components have different chemical compositions and are probed by emission lines excited by different mechanisms .",
    "until we understand the origin of these plasma components , the interpretation of their chemical composition will be ambiguous .",
    "there is no doubt that both components are present within the nebula in gaseous form .",
    "however , both may not be relevant for all astrophysical purposes , particularly if these purposes pertain to the composition of the ejecta of the progenitor star .    as regards the physical conditions and chemical abundances derived from collisionally - excited lines in ngc 7009",
    ", we find few problems that could prevent their use to reliably measure the chemical composition of the plasma component from which they arise .",
    "the only surprise we find is that we directly observe a recombination contribution to the [ ] @xmath05755 line that is often used as a temperature indicator in ionized nebulae .",
    "once this is accounted for , the [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] temperatures agree .",
    "the [ ] and [ ] densities present a coherent picture of the structure seen in direct images .",
    "these results indicate that the atomic data for these species should be reliable .",
    "we therefore conclude that forbidden lines provide reliable chemical abundances for the plasma component from which they arise .    finally , we recommend further study of the kinematics of recombination lines to determine whether the kinematics we find for the , , , and lines in ngc 7009 is a common phenomenon . likewise ,",
    "further study to determine the frequency of dust discs around the central stars of planetary nebulae would be very useful to ascertain whether these could be an explanation for the adf phenomenon , at least in planetary nebulae with large adfs @xcite .",
