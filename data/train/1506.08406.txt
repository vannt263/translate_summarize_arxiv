    "the 1 - 2  model on the hexagonal lattice was introduced by schwartz and bruck @xcite as an intermediary in the calculation of the capacity of a constrained coding system .",
    "they expressed the capacity via holographic reductions ( see @xcite ) in terms of the number of perfect matchings ( or dimer configurations ) , and the latter may be studied via the pfaffian method of fisher , kasteleyn , and temperley @xcite .",
    "the 1 - 2  model may be viewed as a model of statistical mechanics of independent interest , and it is related to the ising model and the dimer model . in the current paper , we study the 1 - 2  model within this context , and we establish the exact form of the associated critical curve .    a 1 - 2  configuration on the hexagonal lattice @xmath8 is a subset @xmath9 of edges such that every vertex is incident with either one or two edges of @xmath9 .",
    "there are three real parameters @xmath10 , which are associated with the three classes of edges of @xmath11 .",
    "the weight of a configuration on a finite region is the product over vertices @xmath12 of one of @xmath13 chosen according to the edge - configuration at @xmath12 .",
    "( see figure [ fig : sign ] . )    through a sequence of transformations , the 1 - 2  model turns out to be linked to an enhanced ising model , a polygon model , and a dimer model .",
    "these connections are pursued here , and in the linked paper @xcite . the main result ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) states in effect that , when @xmath14 , the surface given by @xmath6 is critical .",
    "this is proved by an analysis of the behaviour of the two - edge correlation function @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "the model is called _ uniform _ if @xmath17 , and",
    "thus the uniform model is not critical in the above sense .",
    "there has been major progress in recent years in the study of two - dimensional ising models via rhombic tilings and discrete holomorphic observables ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a rhombic representation of the critical polygon model associated with the 1 - 2  model , and an associated discrete holomorphic function , but this is not explored here .",
    "certain properties of the underlying hexagonal lattice are utilized heavily in this work , such as trivalence , planarity , and support of a @xmath18 action .",
    "it may be possible to extend many of the results of this paper to certain other graphs with such properties , including the archimedean lattice @xmath19 and the square / octagon lattice @xmath20 .",

    "this paper is concentrated on the 1 - 2  model and its dimer representation .",
    "a related representation involves the polygon model on @xmath11 , and the phase transition of the latter model is the subject of the linked paper @xcite .",
    "the polygon representation is related to the high temperature expansion of the ising model , and results in an inhomogeneous model that may regarded as an extension of the @xmath21 model with @xmath22 ; see @xcite for a recent reference to the @xmath21 model .",
    "the structure of the current work is as follows .",
    "the precise formulation of the 1 - 2  model appears in section [ sec : model ] , and the main theorem ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) is presented in section [ sec : mainthm ] .",

    "the dimer model on @xmath895 with the above edge - weights corresponds to the ising model on the triangular lattice .",
    "note that the spins of the ising model are placed at centres of the dodecagons of @xmath895 .",
    "two adjacent spins have the same state ( respectively , opposite states ) if and only if the corresponding non - triangle edge of @xmath895 separating the two dodecagons are present ( respectively , absent ) .",

    "define the logarithmic gaussian map @xmath906 by @xmath907 and also @xmath908 by @xmath909 by ( * ? ? ? * lemma 5 ) , @xmath155 is harnack , whence the real zeros satisfy @xmath910 . by (",
    "* lemma 3 ) , @xmath911 consists of the singular points of the map @xmath912 .",
    "let @xmath913 .",
    "since @xmath606 is a laurent polynomial , we have that @xmath914 and hence @xmath915 given that @xmath390 takes real values on @xmath279 , @xmath916 .",
