    "in this work we study high @xmath0 ( @xmath3  gev@xmath4 ) exclusive @xmath5 reactions in which one nucleon in the final state can be clearly identified as a knocked - out nucleon which carries practically all of the momentum of the virtual photon .    in the part - i of the present work@xcite we calculated the scattering amplitude of this type of reactions within the generalized eikonal approximation  ( gea ) , in which one expresses the scattering amplitude through the sum of the diagrams corresponding to the @xmath6th order rescattering of the knocked - out nucleon with the residual nucleons in the nucleus . in ref.@xcite",
    "we evaluated each diagram based on the effective feynman diagram rules derived within the gea@xcite .",
    "the manifestly covariant nature of feynman diagrams allowed us to preserve both the relativistic dynamics and the kinematics of the rescattering while identifying the low momentum nuclear part of the amplitude with the nonrelativistic nuclear wave function .",
    "such an approach allows us to account for the internal motion of residual target nucleons in the rescattering amplitude as well as finite excitation energies of residual nuclear system .",
    "these features of the gea are crucial in describing electro - production reactions aimed at the study of short - range nuclear properties since these configurations are characterized by non - negligible values of bound nucleon momenta and excitation energies .",
    "the study of short - range nucleon correlations is the main goals of the present work . with short - range correlations",
    "we identify those interactions between bound nucleons that generate nucleon momenta exceeding the characteristic fermi momentum of the nuclear system , @xmath7  mev / c .",
    "this encompasses interactions due to the short - distance repulsive core and the short to medium - distance tensor interactions of nn system as well as possible three - nucleon interactions which can have both short and medium distance terms .    working in the virtual nucleon framework@xcite",
    "one describes the reaction in the lab frame relating all non - nucleonic degrees of freedom effectively to the off - shellness of the knocked  out ( virtual ) nucleon in the nucleus .",
    "for recent analysis of similar reaction with two proton emission in the final state see ref.@xcite . in calculation of the differential cross section of the reaction we utilize the kinematics of high @xmath0 quasielastic scattering with knocked - out nucleon identified unambiguously in the final state of the reaction .",
    "this allows us to employ the decay function formalism in which the @xmath8 cross section of the reaction can be represented through the convolution of the off - shell electron  bound nucleon cross section and the decay function which characterizes the ground state properties of the nucleus as well as the decay of the spectator state in the final state of the reaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we summarize briefly the reaction , specifics of the kinematics and general form of the differential cross section . in sec.[iii ] we elaborate the decay function formalism and derive the expression for the decay function both for plane wave and distorted wave impulse approximations . for the latter case one obtains the expression based on gea calculation of ref.@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] the numerical analysis of both semi - inclusive @xmath9 and exclusive @xmath10 reactions are presented . in these calculations as an input we use bochum group s calculation of ground state @xmath1 wave function@xcite , said group s parameterization of low - to - intermediate energy nn scattering amplitudes@xcite as well as our updated parameterization of the high energy small angle nn scattering amplitude@xcite .",
    "the main focus in the numerical analysis is the study of two- and three- nucleon short range correlations  ( srcs ) and isolation of the effects associated with single and double rescattering of the knocked - out nucleon off residual nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "we observe significant sensitivity of the decay function to the configurations characteristic to the short - range two- and three - nucleon correlations in the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath10 reaction provides also an ideal testing ground for single and double rescattering processes , which could play a crucial role for studies of color coherence phenomena in hard exclusive nuclear reactions .",
    "our calculations allowed us also to identify kinematics which could provide unprecedented access to the three nucleon forces in @xmath1 .",
    "section [ v ] summarizes our results .",
    "we are studying the reaction : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the initial and scattered electrons with four - momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the @xmath2he nucleus has a four - momentum @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to knocked - out and two recoil nucleons with four - momenta @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "we define also the four - momentum of the virtual photon @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 direction is chosen parallel to @xmath26 and the scattering plane is the plane of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 vectors .",
    "the missing momentum of the reaction is defined as : @xmath28 .",
    "in numerical estimations we will focus on the kinematic region : @xmath29 which allows us to identify @xmath17 as a knocked - out nucleon .",
    "furthermore , we will do numerical investigations for recoil , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and missing @xmath32 momenta covering the region of up to @xmath33  mev / c ( and @xmath34 for the kinematics dominated by the double rescattering ) .",
    "this exceeds the kinematic domain of @xmath35 , within which the gea and virtual nucleon approximation can be reliably applied@xcite",
    ". however , the expectation of the smooth transition to the relativistic region for the main properties of the decay function ( see e.g. @xcite ) gives some validity to our exploratory studies in the region of @xmath36  mev / c .",
    "the properties we consider are the correlation relations between missing momentum / energy and momenta of the recoil nucleons , relative strength of 2n and 3n correlations as well as signatures identified with the single and double rescattering of knocked - out nucleon off spectator nucleons in the target .      in numerical calculations",
    "we restrict ourselves by consideration of unpolarized three- body electro - disintegration reaction of eq.([reaction ] ) .",
    "the differential cross section of reaction ( [ reaction ] ) in which no polarizations are fixed is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "here we sum over final and average over initial spins .",
    "the factor 1/4 comes from the averaging over the initial polarizations of the electron and the nucleus .",
    "since one of the recoil nucleons is not observed , one eliminates this degree of freedom by integrating over @xmath39 .",
    "thus integrated differential cross section is @xmath40 where @xmath41 . in eqs .",
    "( [ cs1 ] ) and ( [ cs2 ] ) the transition matrix , @xmath42 , represents the convolution of the electron and nuclear currents , in which the nuclear current within gea@xcite represents the sum of the ia , single and double rescattering amplitudes , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are derived in ref.@xcite and represent impulse approximation , single and double rescattering amplitudes respectively .",
    "their final expressions are given in eqs.(11 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 27 ) of ref.@xcite respectively .",
    "note that ia corresponds to the impulse approximation contribution in which the pair distortion effects due to interaction of two outgoing recoil nucleons are taken into account .",
    "in description of semi - exclusive @xmath9 reactions it is conventional to introduce a spectral function , @xmath47 , which in the impulse approximation picture describes the probability of finding a struck - nucleon in the nucleus initially having missing momentum @xmath32 and missing energy @xmath48 .",
    "the missing energy characterizes the excitation energy of the final @xmath49 system .",
    "we generalize this approach for the case of the exclusive reaction in ( [ reaction ] ) , as well as for any semi - exclusive reactions involving two - nucleon emission by introducing a nuclear decay function which can be formally defined as@xcite : @xmath50 where one sums over the states , @xmath51 , of @xmath52 residual nucleus and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the total energy of @xmath52 state .",
    "it follows from this definition that the decay function characterizes the joint probability to find a struck nucleon in the nucleus with momentum @xmath32 , missing energy @xmath55 and the recoil nucleon with momentum @xmath30 in the decay product of the residual @xmath49 nucleus .",
    "note that for @xmath56 , eq.([dfunction ] ) assumes the sum over all possible ( bound and continuum ) @xmath57 substates , provided the total excitation energy of @xmath49 final state is @xmath58 .",
    "the general properties of the decay function are discussed in @xcite where the qualitative features are studied within the two - nucleon correlation model .",
    "the following sum rule and normalization condition follow from eq.([dfunction ] ) : @xmath59    within the impulse approximation the cross section of the reaction with two - nucleon emission can be expressed through the decay function as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , with @xmath62 being the kinetic energy of the center mass of the residual @xmath49 system .",
    "@xmath63 is the flux calculated for the moving nucleon with momentum @xmath32 , and @xmath64 represents the cross section of electron - off - shell nucleon scattering is defined without the flux factor ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in these cases factor @xmath65 should not be included in eq.([crsia ] ) . ] .    using the derivations from sec.iiia of ref.@xcite",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the decay function of reaction ( [ reaction ] ) . according to eq.(11 ) of ref.@xcite and eq.([cs2 ] ) one obtains : @xmath66 note that hereafter we use the ground state wave @xmath67 normalized to a.    to understand the role of the pair distortion in the final state of the residual nucleus we will compare @xmath68 with the pwia version of the decay function ( @xmath69 ) , which corresponds to retaining the plane wave part of the residual @xmath70 system s wave function , @xmath71 in eq.(12 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "we also can generalize the definition of the decay function to include the single and double rescatterings of the knock - out nucleon with residual nucleons .",
    "such a generalization usually is meaningful within an approximation in which electromagnetic current of knocked - out nucleon is factorized from rescattering integrals of eqs.(21 ) and ( 27 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "two conditions should be met in order for this factorization to be justified :    * first , one should be able to neglect the charge - exchange part of the amplitude for high energy small angle @xmath70 rescatterings .",
    "this follows , first , from the fact that at sufficiently high energies the energy dependence of the small angle hadronic scattering amplitude scales as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 corresponds to the spin of the exchanged particle @xcite . since",
    ", at energies considered , charge - exchange requires predominantly spin-0 exchange in the @xmath74-channel as compared to spin - one exchange in the diagonal channel , one expects strong @xmath75 suppression of the charge - exchange amplitude as compared to the elastic @xmath70 amplitude .",
    "analysis of the existing data on nn scattering demonstrates ( see e.g. @xcite ) that starting at @xmath76 gev@xmath4 the charge - exchange part amounts only a third of the forward scattering @xmath70 amplitude and decreases linearly with an increase of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , this contribution is further suppressed due to the fact that the charge - exchange amplitude is predominantly real and does not interfere with the dominant part of the fsi amplitudes which are predominantly imaginary .",
    "taking into account also the larger slope factor of the @xmath74 dependence of charge - exchange amplitude as compared to the forward scattering , one estimates only a few percent overall contribution to the @xmath70 rescattering amplitude at @xmath76 gev@xmath4 .",
    "this contribution decreases sharply with an increase of @xmath0 . * secondly , the transfered momentum , @xmath77 , should be large enough that one can neglect the @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 dependencies in the electromagnetic current in eqs.(21 ) and ( 27 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "such an approximation is justified by the kinematic condition of eq.([kin ] ) and by the fact that the characteristic average momenta transferred during @xmath70 rescattering are restricted by the slope of the exponent in eq.(a2 ) of ref.@xcite , i.e. @xmath81  ( mev / c)@xmath4 .    keeping only the diagonal part in the @xmath70 rescattering amplitude and factorizing the electromagnetic current of knocked - out nucleon",

    "this corresponds to the minimal missing mass of recoil 2n system with missing energy : @xmath105 * * type 3n - ii * correlations , in which case the nucleon is knocked - out from the symmetric configurations where all three nucleons have the same momentum @xmath104 , fig.[3nsrc](b ) .",
    "this corresponds to a significantly higher value of @xmath58 as compared to the the above discussed 2n and 3n src cases : @xmath106      we start with the calculation of the spectral function as it is defined in eq.([srule ] ) .",
    "this quantity is relevant primarily for semi - exclusive @xmath9 reactions , in which only the scattered electron and knocked - out nucleon are registered .",
    "figure [ spectral ] shows the spectral functions for the cases of knocked - out proton  ( a ) and knocked - out neutron  ( b ) calculated with the @xmath1 ground state wave function based on the potential@xcite .",
    "the hatched surface represents the pwia prediction while dotted contours show the effect of pair distortion .",
    "the correlation feature of eq.([empm_2n - i ] ) is reflected in the emergence of the broad peak in @xmath58 distribution at @xmath107  mev / c , while the signature of 2n - ii correlations is seen in the minimum of the @xmath58 distribution at @xmath102 for the case of knocked - out neutron with two recoil protons .",
    "this minimum reflects the fact that the relative momentum distribution in the @xmath94 pair has a node in the @xmath108-state at @xmath109  mev / c .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous analyses of spectral function@xcite .",
    "the emergence of these correlations at @xmath107  gev / c are clearly seen in fig.([spectralsrc ] ) , in which solid and doted lines represent calculations within pwia and ia approximations respectively .",
    "the positions of the peaks can be related to the dominance of type 2n - i srcs in the high missing momentum part of the nuclear wave function @xcite according to eq.([empm_2n - i ] ) ( i.e. @xmath110 ) .",
    "the solid arrows in the figure correspond to the prediction of eq.([empm_2n - i ] ) corresponding to the scattering off a quasi - free and stationary two - nucleon correlation .",
    "this situation is reflected in the fact that , at large nucleon momenta @xmath104 , the spectral function has similar functional dependence on @xmath104 as the stationary two nucleon correlation @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that there were several experimental indications@xcite of @xmath111 correlations according to eq.([empm_2n - i ] ) .",
    "however , the lower values of @xmath0 in these experiments did not allow direct discrimination of the short - range two - body forces from the long - range two - body currents corresponding to the meson - exchange contributions .",
    "the type 2n - ii src can be identified clearly only for the spectral function involving two protons in the recoil kinematics , fig.[spectralsrc](b ) . as figs.[spectral ] and [ spectralsrc ]",
    "demonstrate , no clear signatures are seen for 3n correlations .",
    "one expects type 3n - i correlations to dominate at the left corner of the @xmath58 distribution starting at @xmath112  mev / c , while type 3n - ii correlations dominate at the right ( higher value ) corner of the @xmath58 distribution starting at @xmath113  mev / c .",
    "fig.[spectralsrc ] also demonstrates a strong dependence of pair - distortion effects on considered values of @xmath58 and @xmath104 .",
    "the pair distortion effects can be assessed quantitatively in fig.[spectralpd ] which shows the missing momentum , @xmath104 , distribution of the ratios of the spectral functions calculated within the pwia and ia approximations for different values of @xmath58 .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that the pair distortion strongly suppresses ( by a factor of five ) the spectral function at the kinematic region of small @xmath104 and @xmath58 .",
    "this reflects the fact that in this region two spectator nucleons have vanishing relative momentum at which the interaction cross section is very large . for the same reason , one observes significant pair distortion effects in the kinematics ( see eq.([empm_3n - i ] ) ) favorable for studies of type 3n - i correlations ( high @xmath104 part of the solid curve in fig.([spectralpd ] ) ) .",
    "note that in this case pair distortion is larger for the @xmath93 recoil case than for the @xmath94 case .",
    "pair distortion is also large in the kinematics of very large @xmath114 ( dotted and dash doted lines in fig.[spectralpd ] ) where one expects the dominance of type 3n - ii correlations .",
    "the large pair distortion effects in the kinematics of 3n correlations can be understood qualitatively .",
    "the pair distortion effectively represents the three - nucleon correlation , in which the initial short range @xmath70 correlation between knocked - out nucleon and one of the spectator nucleons is combined with the final state @xmath70 reinteraction between two recoil nucleons .    for type 2n - i correlations , fig.[spectralpd ] ( dashed lines )",
    "reveals modest pair distortion effects starting at @xmath115mev / c . at the same time",
    ", fig.[spectralpd ] demonstrates more pair distortion for type 2n - ii correlations .",
    "this result can also be understood qualitatively . for type 2n - i correlations , one of the recoil nucleons is initially in the src , while the second one is separated from the src with relatively small momentum . as a result ,",
    "once one of the nucleons is instantaneously removed from the src , the two recoil nucleons in the final state will be spatially separated , thus reducing the probability for their interaction .",
    "the situation is different for type 2n - ii correlations in which two recoil nucleons are in the src and are spatially close to each other .",
    "this will result in much larger pair distortion effects than for type 2n - i correlations .",
    "the observed feature is consistent with the qualitative arguments of ref.@xcite that to break the src and release a spectator from it with minimal distortion it is preferable to knock - out a nucleon directly from the src .",
    "the next question we address is whether the spectral function can provide an effective framework for studies of the implication of three nucleon forces  ( 3nfs ) in the ground state wave function of @xmath1 .",
    "qualitatively , one expects that the onset of 3nfs to arise in the kinematics dominated by three - nucleon correlations .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in fig.[spectral3 m ] where the main 3nf effects are seen at @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "here we consider the difference in the predictions of the spectral functions calculated based on the @xmath1 wave functions which are calculated with and without explicit inclusion of 3nfs ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "predictions are made within pwia are denoted by dotted and dashed lines in fig.[spectral3 m ] .",
    "however , as it was discussed above , in the same region of @xmath58 and @xmath104 we predict sizable effects due to pair distortion , which effectively imitates a three - nucleon correlation .",
    "as fig.[spectral3 m ] demonstrates pair distortion  ( solid lines ) will considerably diminish signatures related to 3nf effects in the spectral function .",
    "the inclusion of the fsi of the knocked - out nucleon with spectator nucleons removes the isotropy of spectral function with respect to the direction of the virtual photon , @xmath118 . to asses",
    "the fsi effects quantitatively , we analyze the ratio , @xmath119 , defined as follows : @xmath120 where subscripts @xmath121 and @xmath122 denote the spectral functions calculated with and without fsi effects . here",
    "@xmath123 corresponds to the small effects of the fsi , while @xmath124 or @xmath125 will indicate the dominance of the absorption or the rescattering effects due to the fsi .",
    "based on the analysis of the analytic properties of rescattering amplitudes in gea  @xcite , it is possible to identify the kinematic regions in which one can isolate the fsi or the src as the dominant term in the scattering amplitude .",
    "similar to the reaction of exclusive electro - disintegration of the deuteron@xcite , one expects the fsi to dominate in nearly transverse kinematics in which @xmath126 and @xmath127  mev / c . here",
    ", @xmath128 in the ia describes the momentum fraction of the nucleus carried out by a nucleon `` 1 '' in the infinite momentum frame of the nucleus .",
    "it is defined as follows : @xmath129 where the  minus \" components of momenta are defined by @xmath130 .",
    "fig.[fsi_th ] represents the @xmath131 dependence of @xmath119 at different values of @xmath104 calculated at @xmath132  gev@xmath4 .",
    "the missing energy in these calculations is chosen for the type 2n - i correlation ( eq.([empm_2n - i ] ) ) .",
    "the figure demonstrates the presence of significant fsi effects in the near - transverse kinematics , @xmath133 , with the effects diminishing at parallel  ( @xmath134 ) and anti - parallel  ( @xmath135 ) kinematics . ]",
    "the missing energy @xmath58 , gives us an additional degrees of freedom to `` manipulate '' the relative strength of the fsi and src effects in the different kinematics of electro - disintegration .",
    "this is especially important for isolating src structures in the spectral function as it is measured in @xmath136 reaction . in the beginning of sec.[iv ] , we identified several kinematic regions in which the strength of the spectral function is largely determined by srcs .",
    "in all these cases , the initial momenta of at least two nucleons in the nucleus exceeds @xmath137  mev / c .",
    "the final state reinteraction of the knocked - out nucleon with the spectator nucleons can largely destroy this picture .",
    "for example , as can be seen from eqs.(21 ) and ( 27 ) in ref.@xcite , due to the integration in the rescattering loops , it is impossible to ensure the appearance of large values of internal momenta in the ground state wave function of the nucleus in a straightforward way .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath107  mev / c or @xmath138  mev may not ensure the dominance of the high - momentum component in the ground state wave function of the nucleus .",
    "this situation may significantly affect the identification of type 2n and 3n correlations .",
    "the problem of suppression of the fsi in probing the src in the @xmath136 reaction was addressed within the gea in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was observed that a trivial condition , @xmath139 , is not sufficient to probe the src component of the ground state nuclear wave function .",
    "one needs to impose the following additional condition on the effective longitudinal momentum , @xmath140 , entering the single rescattering amplitude , @xmath141 with this , one will ensure that rescatterings happen within the src .",
    "note that `` @xmath140 ' 's in eq.([pz ] ) correspond to the pole values of fast nucleon propagators in the rescattering amplitude ( see e.g. eq.(21 ) in ref.@xcite ) .    in fig.[fig_pz ] , we consider the @xmath58 ( @xmath140 ) dependence of @xmath119 for parallel  ( a ) and anti - parallel  ( b ) kinematics for values of @xmath104 equal to @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144  mev / c . in fig.[fig_pz](a ) , the center of mass momentum of the two recoil nucleons is in the direction backward to @xmath118 , while in fig.[fig_pz](b ) , the recoil system is produced in the forward direction .",
    "one can see from this figure that the fsi indeed decreases with increase of @xmath145 .",
    "this indicates that the fsi is increasingly confined within the src .",
    "an interesting feature of these results is that while the fsi contribution keeps decreasing with increase of @xmath145 in the kinematic region relevant for type 2n - i and 3n - ii correlations , it grows sharply in the region associated with the type 3n - i correlations .",
    "both trends can be understood qualitatively . when @xmath146 , one has dominant contributions from the fsi involving uncorrelated nucleons which have a larger probability amplitude in the ground state wave function of @xmath1 .",
    "once @xmath147 , the fsi takes place predominantly within the 2n correlation . in the latter case , for type 2n - i src",
    ", the third nucleon has a small momentum and is spatially separated from the nn src .",
    "thus , it does not contribute substantially to the fsi .    for type 3n - i correlations both spectator nucleons",

    "namely , we consider , @xmath152 where @xmath153 is defined in eqs.([dia ] ) or ( [ ddwia ] ) .",
    "this integration takes into account the fact that one of the components of @xmath32 or @xmath30 is not independent and is fixed from the energy conservation condition for the quasi - elastic disintegration of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath154 represents a quantity which could be extracted directly from a @xmath5 experiment .",

    "these correlations are dominating the landscape of the ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) distribution once @xmath158 .",
    "fig.[decay_pwia_p ] shows also that the @xmath93 srcs are significantly larger than the @xmath94 correlations .",
    "thus , measuring the decay function will allow a direct check of the relative strength of @xmath94 and @xmath93 correlations .",
    "we conclude , from the discussions of figs.[decay_pwia_n ] and [ decay_pwia_p ] , that the decay function is strikingly more sensitive to the src than the @xmath111 correlation observed in the spectral function .",
    "next we analyze the features of the decay function related to the type 2n - ii correlations . from the consideration of the spectral function in the previous section , we learned that reactions corresponding to the knock - out of the neutron are best suited for studies of type 2n - ii correlations since , at small @xmath159  mev / c and large @xmath58 , the spectral function exhibits a minimum associated with the node in the relative momentum distribution of the recoil @xmath94 pair in the @xmath108-state . in fig.[decay_2n - ii ] we show the ( @xmath160 ) distribution of the decay function which demonstrates strong correlations between the minimum in the @xmath58 distribution and the value of recoil nucleon momenta at small @xmath104 ( @xmath161  mev / c in the calculation ) .",

    "one can check whether the expectation that type 3n - i and 3n - ii correlations will dominate in the dynamics of three nucleon correlations is justified .",
    "for this we observe that the configurations of fig.[3nsrc ] are characterized by a distinctive angular relations between the two recoil nucleons : for type 3n - i src two recoil nucleons will be produced at small relative angle ( almost parallel ) while for type 3n - ii src the relative angle of the recoil nucleon momenta is @xmath162 . in fig.[decay_src ] we analyze the dependence of the decay function on the relative angle between the recoil nucleons , @xmath163 , and the missing energy , @xmath58 , for different values of missing momentum , @xmath104 .",

    "for the 3n correlations we also consider the case in which all three nucleons have relative momenta exceeding the characteristic mean field momentum in the nucleus and have a relative angle @xmath215 ( type 3n - ii src ) .    in discussing the spectral function ,",
    "we demonstrate that it exhibits several unique features related to the structure of 2n correlations .",
    "these are the correlation between missing momenta and missing energy and the minimum in the spectral function associated with the node in the relative momentum distribution of the @xmath94 pair .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous analyzes of spectral function ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are , however , no clear cut signatures in the spectral function related to the 3n correlations . within pwia , 3n srcs",
    "reveal only through the strength of spectral function at very high values of missing momenta and/or energy .",
    "our new result in considering the spectral function is that the strength related to the 3n srcs is practically washed out by the pair distortion and the fsi effects .",
    "considering the decay function , which is practically an unexplored quantity , we observe that within pwia it clearly exhibits the main features of 2n and 3n correlations .",
    "subsequent analysis of pair distortion and fsi effects revealed that the additional degrees of freedom associated with the full detection of the decay products of the reaction allows us to pinpoint unambiguously the kinematics in which the fsi or src plays a dominant role .",
    "our conclusion is that the comprehensive study of the decay function in exclusive reactions will allow an unprecedented access to the 2n and 3n correlations in the nuclei .",
    "we highlight two particular cases .",
    "one is the possibility to isolate double rescattering effects which can provide us a new and powerful tool in studying color transparency phenomena .",
    "the other is identifying a kinematic window that will allow us to probe directly the effects associated with three - nucleon forces in the ground state wave function of @xmath1 .",
    "our overall conclusion is that the investigation of the decay function opens up a completely new venue in studies of short range nuclear properties and allows us to discriminate between different orders of final state reinteractions .",
    "the latter will provide a powerful tool in studies of color transparency phenomena .",
    "we are grateful to andreas nogga for providing us with bochum group s wave functions of @xmath1 .",
    "special thanks to richard arndt and igor strakovsky for their help in using the said program .",
    "we thank ted rogers for careful reading of the manuscript and for many valuable comments .",
