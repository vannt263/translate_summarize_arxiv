    "in 1905 pearson proposed what we now know as a random walk @xcite .",
    "for a one - dimensional system the problem can be formulated in the following way : a particle jumps at each point of time from its current position @xmath0 to the position @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 , or @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the approach towards diffusion theory , pioneered by einstein , relies on postulates very similar to the ones for the random walk , leading to the same results when the jump width @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , in many situations , the assumptions used by einstein and pearson do not hold ; one of such examples is the transport of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors when exposed to an electric field .",
    "sixty years after pearson , in 1965 , montroll and weiss introduced the theory of continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "it was applied to the transport in semiconductors in works by scher and lax @xcite , and scher and montroll @xcite . due to its historical importance and vivid clarity",
    "we recall here the definition of the ctrw as given by scher and montroll @xcite : _ in our model we postulate our material to be divided into a regular lattice of equivalent cells , with each cell containing many randomly distributed localized sites available for hopping carriers .",
    "carrier transport is a succession of carrier hops from one localized site to another and finally from one cell to another .",
    "we define the hopping time to be the time interval between the moment of arrival of a carrier into one cell and the moment of arrival into the next cell into which it lands . the random distribution of sites and hence the disorder of an amorphous material is incorporated into a hopping - time distribution function",
    "@xmath6_. the appropriate distribution @xmath6 , leading to the agreement with the experiments , was shown to possess the power - law form : @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for this range of the fractional exponent @xmath9 all the moments of the distribution @xmath10 diverge and the corresponding process has no characteristic time scale , thus exhibiting the phenomenon of _ aging_. as a result , the process undergoes subdiffusion @xcite , i.e. , the mean square displacement grows in the absence of an external force slower than linearly in time , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .    in the original study of the fractional transport in the context of anomalous transport in semiconductors an ensemble of carriers executing a random walk , when biased by an electric field , was studied @xcite . in the present paper",
    "our focus is different : we instead address the problem of the carriers executing the random walk in a spatially varying periodic potential .",
    "this situation is representative for many applications occurring in areas such as in condensed matter physics , chemical physics , nanotechnology , and molecular biology , to name but a few . for those applications it is of utmost importance to account for the spatial variation of the transport process @xcite .",

    "is derived and the theoretical result is corroborated by numerical simulations of the ctrw for different shapes of periodic potentials .",

    "the term proportional to @xmath90 becomes relevant for @xmath91 only in the limit @xmath92 , leading to the normal diffusive behavior , or for @xmath71 as @xmath93 , i.e. , for a periodic potential .",

    "equation  ( [ einstein ] ) is valid in the linear response regime also for any periodic potential @xmath94 , as the problem of fractional diffusion in a periodic potential can be mapped onto the force free case  @xcite . in doing",

    "we notice that in the absence of a bias , all the odd moments of the probability density are identically zero both for normal and fractional diffusion . as for the second moment , upon introducing the re - scaled time , @xmath132 it follows from equation  ( [ fpx20 ] ) that the mean square displacement ( in units of @xmath133 ) formally coincides with that of the normal diffusion case , @xmath134 / l^2 = 2 \\ , t ' \\ , t'$ ] , independently of the fractional exponent @xmath9 , wherein @xmath135 , with @xmath57 the potential amplitude , is the re - scaled temperature .",

    ", width=566 ]    moreover , as soon as the process is biased by an external finite force , @xmath147 , a qualitative difference arises in the time evolutions of the probability densities of the anomalous and the normal processes in the long time limit as well , see also ref .   @xcite .",

    "the global maximum of the density remains close , however , to its initial position ( figure  [ dist - f ]  ( below ) ) @xcite .",

    "with this work we investigated anomalous diffusion whose dynamics is governed by a fractional fokker - planck equation with a spatially varying , periodic potential . as a main result",
    "we derive a generalization of the celebrated lifson - jackson result for normal diffusion @xcite to our case with anomalous fractional diffusion : it relates the effective fractional diffusion coefficient @xmath150 in eq .",
    "( [ flj ] ) to the bare fractional diffusion coefficient in terms of two inverse quadratures of the periodic potential only . as a consequence",
    ", we find that like in the case with normal diffusion the effective anomalous diffusion becomes always suppressed over the bare value .",
    "this result may find ample application in diverse areas where anomalous diffusion occurs ; typical examples are the case of superionic conductors @xcite or for the josephson junction dynamics @xcite when the role of disorder may change the normal diffusion into anomalous one .",
    "in addition , we contrasted the time evolution for normal diffusion with anomalous , fractional diffusion . in doing so , we find that after a proper re - scaling of time the corresponding asymptotic densities @xmath46 for the coordinate @xmath0 match each other .",
    "distinct differences occur , however , at small evolution times .",
    "this time evolution of the densities drastically changes upon the application of a finite bias @xmath59 .",
    "now , the long time evolution between normal diffusion and anomalous diffusion becomes markedly distinct as well : while the maximum of the biased normal diffusion moves with the normal , directed current , the anomalous case is dominated by a ballistic spreading that leaves the maximum of the density around the origin .",
    "moreover , this characteristic difference can be put to work to differentiate between fractional and fractal brownian diffusion .",
