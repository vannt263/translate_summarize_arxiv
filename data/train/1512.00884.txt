    "for a fundamental particle such as the proton to have a non - zero electric dipole moment ( edm ) would violate both time reversal ( t ) and parity ( p ) symmetries .",
    "both of these symmetries are , in fact , violated in the standard model , but too weakly to account for the observed matter - antimatter imbalance in the universe .",
    "this motivates measuring the proton edm .",
    "this will require trapping an intense polarized proton beam in a `` frozen spin '' all - electric storage ring `` trap '' .",
    "even in an electric field the spin precession of a moving proton is dominated by the motional magnetic field in the proton s rest frame , acting on the magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) .",
    "but , the edm and mdm precessions can be distinguished , because their precession axes are orthogonal .    an ideal configuration for precision measurement of elementary particle parameters , such as magnetic dipole moments",
    ", would maintain the particles in a wall - free configuration stabilized by the electrostatic interaction of the charges .",
    "earnshaw s theorem proves this to be impossible . nevertheless , by introducing rf cavities , lasers , etc .",
    ", not covered by the theorem , it has been possible to store low energy particles indefinitely in various `` bottles '' or `` traps '' .",
    "relativistic charged particles can even be stored , wall - free , in storage rings , which rely on quadrupoles , solenoids , field gradients , or pole - edge rotation , to provide the `` linear '' focusing traditionally thought to be necessary to keep the particles captured .",
    "this paper proposes an electric `` bottle '' capable of storing an intense beam of relativistic protons ( or electrons , or other charged particles ) . except for rf cavity ( required to provide longitudinal , bunched beam , stability ) and occasional brief `` reflections '' from octupole fields ,",
    "the particles survive indefinitely , most of the time in nearly uniform fields .",
    "this proposal has been motivated primarily by the requirements for measuring the proton electric dipole moment ( edm ) or , more particularly , by the need to suppress the most important systematic error limiting that measurement .",
    "the reflection mechanism resembles the end reflections in ( non - relativistic ) `` magnetic mirror machines '' developed independently by post in the u.s.a . and budker in the u.s.s.r .",
    "but , unlike those devices , small amplitude particles can not escape the proposed trap .",
    "various designs have been proposed for measuring the electric dipole moments of charged particles , especially the proton@xcite@xcite and electron , in all - electric , frozen spin , storage rings .",
    "for an all - electric ring any non - zero edm will cause spin precession about an axis forbidden by p and t symmetry . the overwhelmingly most serious background will be due to the presence of radial magnetic field @xmath5 . here",
    "the @xmath6 connotes that the field would ideally be zero , and the @xmath7 is the radially outward coordinate .",
    "( following standard accelerator terminology , the @xmath0 field will , where appropriate , be expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radial component in a local , frenet coordinate system . )",
    "the field @xmath10 , acting on the particle magnetic moment , causes precession that exactly mimicks the precession caused by the primary bending electric field , @xmath8 , acting on the ( vastly weaker ) edm . even with @xmath10 reduced to the extent possible , it will be challenging to reduce the systematic error to a value small enough to provide a serious test of the standard model ( which predicts a value @xmath11 less than @xmath12e - cm , for the proton edm ) .",
    "reducing @xmath10 is not the only motivation for all - electric bending .",
    "electric bending also permits reversing the beam direction of circulation without changing any ring parameters . with vanishing magnetic fields , time reversal invariance ,",
    "guarantees that all particle orbits are exactly preserved ( except in direction ) when the injection direction is reversed , irrespective of positioning and powering errors .",
    "any magnetic field error @xmath10 will move all the beam orbits up or down , depending on the average @xmath13 .",
    "reversing the beam direction will reverse this shift . the most effective way of reducing the magnetic field error will be to use the ring as a `` self - magnetometer '' , with the vertical beam position measured by beam position monitors ( bpms ) , to adjust magnetic vertical steering elements to eliminate the average vertical orbit shift when the beam direction is reversed .    vertical focusing limits the effectiveness of this approach .",
    "with no vertical focusing one could dream that , if the clockwise ( cw ) beam is lost in the up - direction then the ccw beam would be lost in the down - direction . in fact , because of vertical focusing , no beam at all is , in fact , lost . the best one can do is to design the ring to maximize the measurable vertical orbit shift when the beam direction is reversed .",
    "nonlinear ( octupole ) focusing can be strong enough at large amplitudes to avoid particle loss , yet weak enough at small amplitudes to permit precise magnetometry .    the approach to be taken can be motivated by an analogy .",
    "the weight of a fish can be determined by hanging the fish from a spring whose length is measured by a linear scale . to serve for both small and big fish , with scale of convenient length , the spring constant would be strong . for better accuracy for small fish ,",
    "the spring constant would be weak",
    ". the ideal spring would be weak for small fish but strong for big fish .",
    "an octupole has just this character : its field gradient is negligible for small displacements , strong for large displacements .    but accelerator focusing behavior is more complicated .",
    "quadrupoles in accelerator lattices , if focusing in one plane , say vertical , are defocusing in the other plane .",
    "something like this also applies to octupole focusing , though , for small amplitudes , a vertically focusing octupole is also horizontally focusing .",
    "but we need only very weak vertical focusing .",
    "we therefore anticipate a region of phase space near the origin for which the vertical focusing is weak .",
    "meanwhile the relatively strong horizontal geometric focusing is much stronger than the octupole focusing .",
    "the simplest possible electrostatic ring consists of coaxial cylindrical electrodes , of inner and outer radii @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the gap width between the electrodes .",
    "a sector of such a ring is shown in figure  [ fig : cylindricalelectrodes ] .",
    "the bold curve shows a proton orbit passing through a curved - planar cylindrical electrostatic bending element .",
    "the electrode spacing is @xmath15 and the design orbit is centered between the electrodes .",
    "the electric lattice in this paper has 281 m circumference , consisting of 16 indentical bends like this , each with arc length 15.7 m arc length , with the remainder of the circumference taken up by straight sections . ]    in a cylindrically - symmetric electrostatic potential @xmath16 , producing a predominantly - radial electric field @xmath17 , beam particles of charge @xmath18 move in approximately circular orbits close to a horizontal @xmath19 plane .",
    "the @xmath20 coordinate is normal to the plane . on the circular design orbit the centripetal electric force",
    "is provided by the radial electric field @xmath0 ; @xmath21 with @xmath22 being a global longitudinal arc length parameter , and local frenet coordinates @xmath23 , which are incremental offsets , radial , vertical , and longitudinal ( i.e. tangential to the design orbit ) , the betatron equations are@xcite @xmath24 here the numerical value 1.64 has come from choosing @xmath25 appropriate for frozen spin proton operation ( for which this paper is primarily intended ) .",
    "the relativistic factor @xmath26 has the `` magic '' value @xmath27 at which the proton spins are `` frozen '' ( for example , always parallel to the orbit . )",
    "this corresponds to proton kinetic energy @xmath28gev , velocity @xmath29 , and momentum @xmath30gev  relativistic , but not very relativistic .",
    "( [ eq : simplest.1x ] ) and ( [ eq : simplest.1y ] ) differ only slightly from the equations for a traditional weak focusing magnetic ring .",
    "the second shows there is no vertical focusing , meaning the beam will eventually be lost vertically .",
    "vertical stability can be easily restored by contouring the poles slightly ( combined function ) or introducing vertically focusing quadrupoles ( separated function ) .",
    "both of these constitute `` linear focusing '' which , according to ground rules of the present paper , is not to be allowed ( in the interest of maximal magnetometry sensitivity . )",
    "one can object that the term @xmath31 in the @xmath9 equation also constitutes `` linear focusing '' .",
    "but this is `` geometric '' focusing which ( by a convention adopted just for this paper ) is allowable ( in fact , essential ) . the same terminology is standard for a cyclotron  it is geometric focusing that permits the deviation from the design circular orbit to a slightly deviant circular orbit to be described as a horizontal betatron oscillation crossing the design orbit twice per revolution , as if due to focusing .",
    "the extra term @xmath32 in the horizontal focusing is specific to electrostatic focusing .    unlike in a magnetic field , in an electric field",
    "the particle velocity is not conserved , causing the @xmath33 factor to deviate from @xmath25 as the electric potential deviates from zero .",
    "but to a first ( good ) approximation , the orbits are described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : simplest.1x ] ) and ( [ eq : simplest.1y ] ) . the only significant effect of the ring being electrostatic is that the extra term @xmath32 makes the horizontal focusing somewhat stronger than in an old - fashioned , weak - focusing magnetic ring .    neglecting the perturbing effects of the short straight sections between bend elements , in terms of a `` betatron phase '' @xmath34 which",
    ", for this simple ring , is proportional to @xmath22 , and beta function @xmath35 , which is actually independent of @xmath22 , in pseudo - harmonic form , the cosine - like @xmath9 motion for a particle with betatron amplitude @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 because @xmath35 is independent of @xmath22 the integral is trivial . in summary : @xmath39 matching @xmath9 arguments gives @xmath40 the phase advance per turn @xmath41 and the tune @xmath42 are obtained by matching @xmath9 arguments to give @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "one way or another , the vertical motion has to be stabilized . to do this",
    "we introduce an octupole field , assumed to be uniformly distributed around the ring , with local octupole moment per unit length @xmath45 .",
    "( for numerical simulations shown later in this paper the `` uniform octupole distribution '' is modeled as 16 lumped octupoles , one in each straight section . )",
    "the orbit equations become @xmath46 as well as the octupole terms@xcite , for later convenience , we have included other small terms that can be neglected initially . a possible distributed `` trim '' quadrupole is represented by the terms @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; positive @xmath49-value introduces ( very weak ) horizontal focusing and vertical defocusing . also added are constant `` force '' terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this paper concentrates on the added term @xmath51 which represents an unknown magnetic `` force '' that needs to be cancelled .",
    "the term @xmath50 will eventually be set to zero based on the following comments .",
    "though @xmath9 and @xmath20 are locally orthogonal , only @xmath20 is fixed globally , while @xmath9 is a frenet coordinate , always radial . a constant radial force is best treated as a change in radius of curvature , leaving the orbit plane invariant , but changing the design orbit radius .",
    "a constant vertical force , on the other hand , tends to make an otherwise - planar orbit helical , leading to a gradual vertical displacement of the whole orbit .",
    "the octupole terms , as well as being nonlinear , also couple the @xmath9 and @xmath20 motion . solving these equations analytically and in general for all amplitudes is clearly impossible , even if for no other reason than that the motion will become chaotic for sufficiently large amplitudes .",
    "if the equations are to describe anything practical , they will have to apply only to appropriately small amplitudes . fortunately",
    "this will be applicable for electrostatic rings appropriate for measuring edms . to obtain large electic field @xmath52",
    "it is important for electrode gap @xmath15 to be small .",
    "this forces the horizontal ring acceptance to be small .",
    "on the other hand it is feasible for the vertical acceptance to be almost arbitrarily large .",
    "unbalanced acceptance like this is favorable for octupole focusing .",
    "we are interested primarily in two effects influencing the vertical orbit motion .",
    "one is the role played by the electrostatic octupole field present for limiting the vertical motion .",
    "each particle gyrates rapidly while advancing slowly in the vertical direction , oscillating up and down as the octupole field occasionally causes it to reflect , down from the top or up from the bottom .",
    "the other effect to be included is the systematic vertical orbit shift caused by any residual constant radial magnetic field .",
    "sensitivity to this shift , opposite for cw and ccw orbit circulation direction , is the basis of the self - magnetometry function .",
    "language here has been chosen to suggest the non - relativistic orbit of a particle gyrating around a field line in a slowly varying magnetic field , for example in a magnetic bottle or in the earth s ionosphere . with each orbit gyrating rapidly around a `` guiding center '' , it is adequate to describe the motion of the guiding center , rather than following the charged particle itself . in our relativistic storage ring with ultraweak vertical focusing ,",
    "each particle moves in a helical orbit , always in an almost closed circle of radius @xmath53 , perhaps 40 m .",
    "the guiding center hardly moves from the center of the ring , mainly just up and down by , at most , a few centimeters .",
    "the guiding center formalism is appropriate for describing a storage ring relativistic bottle with uniform vertical magnetic field .",
    "this theory is sketched concisely in the section  [ sect : appendix ] appendix . to corroborate applying this theory to magnetic storage rings some teapot@xcite@xcite simulations of a magnetic storage ring bottle",
    "are shown later in this paper .",
    "but we are primarily interested in an the electric storage ring bottle , to be modeled later using eteapot@xcite .",
    "first the equations are solved approximately .",
    "ordinarily , in storage rings , a fast - slow approximation is used in which synchrotron ( energy ) oscillations are `` slow '' enough to be treated as `` adiabatic '' ( i.e. essentially constant ) as regards their influence on @xmath9 and @xmath20 betatron oscillations . slightly different approximations are appropriate in the present situation .",
    "only @xmath9 oscillations are fast ; longitudinal @xmath54 and vertical @xmath20 oscillations are slow .",
    "part of the justification for this picture is based on the particular configuration being discussed , which can be refreshed by reviewing figure  [ fig : cylindricalelectrodes ] . because practical electric forces are vastly weaker than magnetic forces , to produce sufficiently large electric field the electrode gap @xmath15 is necessarily small , 2 or 3 cm .",
    "this restricts the horizontal amplitude @xmath55 to be quite small .",
    "on the other hand , for any stable vertical oscillations , the absence of linear focusing will certainly cause the vertical tune @xmath56 to be very small .",
    "furthermore , since the electrodes can be almost arbitrarily high , the vertical coordinate @xmath20 is allowed to be quite large , much larger than @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests approximating @xmath57 by its average value while treating the @xmath20 motion . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : octupole.1y ] ) we set @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is an approximate r.m.s .",
    "value of @xmath9 for a parabolic - shaped proton beam in a chamber with width @xmath15 .",
    "the result is @xmath60 ( the `` trim quadrupole '' term @xmath48 reserves the possibility of empirically cancelling the @xmath20-term , at least approximately , by tuning the value of the parenthesized term to zero . )    though now decoupled , this equation is still nonlinear .",
    "however , since the right hand side is a function only of @xmath20 , the orbit description can be simplified by introducing ( conserved ) `` energy '' @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( the energy symbol `` h '' introduced here has been chosen the same as an analogous symbol for energy , in the section  [ sect : appendix ] appendix for mnemonic convenience . though the `` h '' roles are analogous in the two contexts , their physical dimensions differ for inessential reasons of convenience . a dimensional factor needed to restore dimensional consistency and a relativistic correction , not very important for @xmath63 protons ,",
    "will be introduced later . )",
    "much of the vertical motion can then be inferred from curves of constant @xmath61 in @xmath64 phase space .",
    "numerical solutions , using maple , are shown in figure  [ fig : b_rsensitivity_p ] . as well as exhibiting three amplitudes , the figure also allows for the presence of a small @xmath51 term , of either sign , black for positive , green for negative .",
    "the `` vertical force sensitivity '' is the beam centroid deviation divided by the vertical `` force '' which , in this case is @xmath65 ( in the units implied by the numerical form given at the top of the figure ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath9-equation , with @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 treated as varying adiabatically , and hence effectively constant , with value @xmath68 ) is @xmath69 numerical determinations of the phase trajectories are shown in figure  [ fig : b_rlinearsensitivity ] .    comparing figures  [ fig : b_rsensitivity_p ] and [ fig : b_rlinearsensitivity ] , one sees that the vertical sensitivity to @xmath51 is two orders of magnitude greater than the horizontal sensitivity to @xmath50 .",
    "of course this is because the horizontal focusing is of linear order , while the vertical focusing is of octupole order . in `` typical '' storage rings the horizontal and vertical focusing strengths are comparable , which is manifested by their radial and vertical tunes @xmath70 and @xmath56 being comparable in magnitude .",
    "our storage ring bottle lattice has therefore achieved the goal of increasing the vertical force sensitivity by a factor of about 100 , compared to typical rings .",
    "this comparison is somewhat misleading howerer , for reasons alluded to earlier .",
    "the main effect of reversing @xmath50 suddenly is a change in gross orbit radius .",
    "but there is also the net radial orbit shift shown in figure  [ fig : b_rlinearsensitivity ] .",
    "the global direction of this shift would depend on the particle azimuthal position when the force was reversed .",
    "as such the shift is not directly commensurate with the vertical magnetometer orbit shift which is the subject of this paper .",
    "also this comparison does not take advantage of potentially increased magnetometer sensitivity using quadrupole @xmath49 to tune the linear focusing coefficient more nearly to zero .",
    "relativistic orbits in a magnetic bottle are analysed in the appendix , following formalism standard in plasma physics .",
    "however , the adiabatic invariance of the product of effective current @xmath71 enclosed area , which is central to the magnetic bottle treatment , may not be valid for an electric bottle , especially because the electric potential depends on position .",
    "nevertheless , since the orbits have already been seen to be so similar , one expects reflections down from the top and up from the bottom to be subject to similar analyses .",
    "when it passes through the @xmath72 horizontal design plane , a given particle has vertical momentum @xmath73 which is , let us say , positive , and certainly very small compared to its total momentum @xmath74 . because @xmath75 , the helical orbit is scarcely distinguishable from a perfect circle .",
    "for many turns , because the octupole is so weak near the origin , @xmath76 remains essentially constant .",
    "but , eventually , the integrated effect of the octupole field is sufficient to reflect the vertical motion . the magnitude @xmath77 of the vertical turning point of the @xmath20-motion clearly increases with increasing @xmath78 .    comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : octupole.3 ] ) with eq .  ( [ eq : magtrap.12 ] ) in the section  [ sect : appendix ] appendix , one sees that vertical motion ( perpendicular to electric field ) in an electric bottle , is subject to much the same analysis as longitudinal motion ( parallel to magnetic field lines ) in a magnetic bottle . in each case",
    "the particle moves more or less freely parallel to the axis of the bottle , but is occasionally restrained by reflection from turning points at one or the other end of the bottle . in the electric bottle",
    "the `` vertical energy '' of a particle with slope @xmath79 at the center of the bottle is @xmath80 ; use of the non - relativistic energy formula ( slightly modified by the @xmath25 factor accounting for inertial mass ) will be justified shortly . at the turning points , at the bottle ends , @xmath81 . substituting into eq .",
    "( [ eq : octupole.3 ] ) , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 produces @xmath84 ( for magic energy protons the relativistic correction is small , and is being neglected in this paper .",
    "but , for magic energy electrons the relativistic factor is @xmath85 , giving a significant relativistic correction even if the vertical component of velocity is non - relativistic . )",
    "solving for @xmath86 produces @xmath87 or , treating @xmath15 as negligibly small , @xmath88 . for real - valued turning points",
    "the octupole strength coefficient @xmath89 certainly has to be negative .",
    "this analysis of a relativistic electric bottle has relied on artificially suppressing coupling between @xmath9 and @xmath20 motions .",
    "this makes the analysis significantly less robust than the treatment of non - relativistic magnetic traps in the appendix ; that treatment utilizes adiabatic invariance to incorporate transverse motion into the longitudinal description .",
    "the adiabatic invariant treatment accurately performs the averaging brought about by the gyrating motion around field lines .",
    "though less elegant , our analysis has assumed ( on intuitive grounds ) that a more or less equivalent averaging is accurately represented by the replacement @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : octupole.1y ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations described in following sections seem to confirm the essential validity of this assumption .",
    "though the analogy between our electric bottle and the plasma physics magnetic bottle analysed in the appendix is close , it is not perfect .",
    "if the lengths of the both bottles are defined to be @xmath91 , then the amplitude of the motion within the electric bottle increases with increasing particle slope @xmath92 , up to a limit beyond which the particle escapes the trap longitudinally .",
    "that is , large amplitude particles are lost out the ends of the relativistic electric trap .",
    "it is low amplitude particles which , because of their too low orbital gyration magnetic moment , that can leak out from the ends of a non - relativistic magnetic plasma trap .    in a subsequent section of this paper the relativistic electric trap is simulated using eteapot and , following that , the relativistic magnetic trap is simulated using teapot numerical simulation .",
    "the qualitative behaviors of these relativistic traps are essentially the same .",
    "but it is only the electric trap for which there is an obvious and unique application .",
    "this application , of course , is the proton ( or electron ) edm measurement .",
    "the high sensitivity to radial magnetic field @xmath1 , along with the opposite vertical displacement that @xmath1 causes for cw and ccw beams , enables the average value @xmath2 to be cancelled to high precision .",
    "the need for self - magnetometry comes from the requirement to minimize the average radial magnetic field @xmath2 in an electric bottle measurement of the edm of the proton ( or the electron ) .",
    "@xmath2 is to be obtained by measuring the average vertical orbit displacement that results when the beam direction is switched from clockwise to counter - clockwise .",
    "though edm run durations will be of order 1000s , the @xmath2 compensation can probably be completed in a measurement sequence taking several seconds .",
    "we assume there is a compensation coil whose integrated value @xmath93 cancels @xmath3 to the same precision that it can be measured magnetic field compensation coils are to be designed remains a serious issue .",
    "almost certainly all elements have to be wired in series , powered by a single dc current of , perhaps , 10ma .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that the @xmath93 compensation field has to be reliably reversible , within about one second , with accuracy better that one part in @xmath94 , with correspondingly stationary mechanical stability , as part of the edm measurement .",
    "ideally the circuit would consist of two current loops around the ring , one above , one below the beam . with ac powering at frequency low enough for vertical orbits to follow",
    ", this circuit will provide an accurate magnetometer calibration .",
    "ac - coupled ( to guarantee reversal symmetry ) at , say 0.001hz frequency , this process might even be the basis for the actual edm measurement . ] . to produce a numerical result",
    "we will assume the all - electric proton lattice whose behavior is simulated in later section  [ sect : electricbottle ] .",
    "the basic magnetometry idea is that the unknown magnetic field @xmath3 , though insignificant over a single turn , acts monotonically over multiple turns , constantly tending to change the vertical orbit slope .",
    "lattice element forces , also small near the origin , but producing net focusing , are just large enough to prevent the eventual loss of injected particles .",
    "it is the displacement of the centroid of the injected bunch that provides the measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "one thing that makes the process difficult to analyse is that , even if the injected bunch is ideally well collimated it is probably mismatched , and quickly filaments to a broader equilibrium betatron distribution . during this evolution",
    "the particles are subject to oscillatory restoring forces large compared to the magnetic force being measured .",
    "the bpm electronics will be required to measure a vertical centroid shift very small compared to the r.m.s .",
    "bunch height @xmath95 .",
    "another complication , neglected so far , is that there will surely also be a systematic non - zero vertical electric field error @xmath96 that will , itself , produce a vertical shift of the beam centroid , probably large compared to the magnetic shift we have been discussing  for example because of imperfect electrode shapes or positioning .",
    "this shift will be nulled by @xmath97 compensation provided by multiple vertically - separated electrodes , distributed as finely and uniformly as possible , in straight sections around the ring .",
    "this compensation will be paired with the @xmath98 magnetic compensation , also distributed as uniformly as possible around the ring .",
    "this pairing is natural since both of these field components deflect the beam vertically .",
    "the result of perfect empirical adjustment would be @xmath99 for single beam operation , what has so far been referred to as a `` magnetometer '' actually responds to the sum of electric and magnetic vertical forces .",
    "the actual magnetometry functionality only comes from measuring the difference between cw and ccw beams .",
    "it has to be recognized then , that when a single beam centroid position is adjusted , with either @xmath100 or @xmath101 , it is actually the sum of the electric and magnetic vertical forces that is being cancelled .    during each",
    "run the vertical electric field average @xmath96 is likely to drift enough to require feedback stabilization .",
    "certainly any such feedback has to rely on electric ( not magnetic ) vertical steering .",
    "it is important to realize that , by itself , the presence of a @xmath96 field error does not affect the edm measurement  any precession this field causes is around a vertical axis and will be cancelled as part of a phase - locked polarization control feedback systems . in this sense",
    "the @xmath100 value is unimportant .    for the edm measurement",
    "the @xmath101 compensation coil will be adjusted to null the vertical separation of cw and ccw circulating beams .",
    "one candidate for proton edm measurement@xcite@xcite employs simultaneously counter - circulating proton beams for , perhaps , @xmath102 seconds , or @xmath94 turns .",
    "both the ( non - critical ) electric and the ( critical ) magnetic nulling could then be accomplished in real time during a single fill .",
    "this will be ideal for self - magnetometry , which should work splendidly .",
    "furthermore the method will work well even with unequal beam currents .",
    "unfortunately , simultaneously counter - circulating beams bring in all manner of other experimental complications .",
    "perhaps the most troublesome is that wien filters ( needed for some operations ) are directional .",
    "adjusted to have no effect on orbits of one beam , they deflect counter - circulating orbits .",
    "also , simultaneously counter - circulating beams can not be used to measure the edm of particles other than proton and electron , since both electric and bending is required in the ring to freeze their spins .",
    "nevertheless , the single beam cancellation of radial magnetic field will be satisfactory .",
    "the alternative to simultaneously counter - circulating beams is nulling @xmath3 between every data collection run .",
    "this would employ a sequence of brief runs alternating between cw and ccw circulation , with the nulling improved iteratively .",
    "this nulling will be performed using @xmath101 compensation .",
    "wien filter directionality also complicates this magnetic field nulling .",
    "wien filters would probably be turned off during @xmath2 cancellation .",
    "then spurious precession due to the wien filter itself would need to be accounted for separately , which is at least a nuisance .",
    "the real problem , though , comes from unknown magnetic field changes occurring during actual edm runs and interpretable as being due to edms .",
    "neverthless , alternating between cw and ccw runs separated by brief magnetic field compensation is calculated@xcite to produce very accurate edm measurements .      in eq .",
    "( [ eq : octupole.2 ] ) , as is customary in lattice theory , the ring dynamics have been expressed in purely geometric terms , with no reference whatsoever to absolute momenta , nor electric nor magnetic field strengths . to estimate magnetometer precision ,",

    "the novel relativistic bottles proposed here are more than a curiosity .",
    "especially the electric bottle is appropriate for measuring the electric dipole moments , especially of the proton , but also the electron and other fundamental particles . because of the proton s particular anomalous magnetic moment , a polarized proton beam of `` magic '' 234mev kinetic energy , can be `` frozen '' , meaning that the polarization vector rotates at the same rate , and around the same axis , as the momentum .",
    "out - of - plane tipping of the beam polarization provides the signal basic to the storage ring measurement of the proton edm .",
    "( see reference@xcite . )",
    "edm measurement relies on measuring the precession caused by the electric field acting on the particle edm .",
    "but the proton mdm is vastly greater than the edm ( whose very existence implies breakdown of both parity and time reversal invariance ) for which only upper limits are known . by design @xmath105 but ,",
    "inevitably , there will be @xmath5 error fields .",
    "the only way to minimize mdm - induced precession is to cancel the magnetic field , primarily by magnetic shielding , secondarily , by cancelling residual magnetic fields by compensation coils .",

    "this is because a shift of the beam orbit caused by the unknown magnetic field error , is strictly proportional to the spin precession that needs to be cancelled .",
    "the all - electic case , appropriate only for proton or electron edm measurement , has been emphasized in this paper .",
    "this is the only case where counter - circulating beams can co - exist .",
    "however the high - sensitivity magnetometry will be applicable also for rings containing both magnetic and electric bending .",
    "conventional storage rings rely on quadrupole focusing .",
    "this paper has shown how storage rings with only octupole focusing elements will perform much like conventional rings .",
    "it is `` sefl - magnetometry '' that motivates replacing quadrupole focusing by octupole focusing .",
    "the electric storage ring bottle with only octupole focusing is ideal for this task .",
    "because the orbit shift to be detected is vertical , it is important for the vertical focusing to be _",
    "weak_a small vertical force gives a large vertical orbit shift .",
    "relative to this focusing , the geometric horizontal focusing associated with the uniform bending field is strong . as a result ,",
    "horizontal motion is much the same as in a conventional ring .",
    "it is only the vertical focusing that is weak .",
    "this contrast is most clearly visible in figure  [ fig : elecmagn - x ] . in particular , unlike in a conventional ring , the vertical tune @xmath56 is roughly proportional to the vertical betatron amplitude .",
    "the performance of an all - electric relativistic storage ring with only octupole focusing has been investigated in section  [ sect : electricbottle ] from the point of view of regular storage ring operation .",
    "there is satisfactory stability in all three phase space coordinates in spite of the fact that vertical focusing is provided by octupoles rather than quadrupoles .",
    "furthermore , the geometric focusing in the bend elements provides ample horizontal focusing . in short ,",
    "no quadrupoles ( except , perhaps , trim quadrupoles ) need to be present in the lattice .",
    "in section  [ sect : magneticbottle ] a quite similar magnetic ring is analysed and found to perform similarly . the section  [ sect : appendix ] appendix gives a formalism , copied from well known plasma physics theory , for describing a storage ring as a magnetic bottle .",
    "the purpose for this appendix is to emphasize that charged particles storage in a `` bottle '' is not new , and that the nonrelativistic theory can easily be applied to relativistic storage rings .",
    "this section is something of a epilogue , contemplating the experimental implications for the proton edm measurement that motivated the paper .",
    "the main edm measurement issues were introduced in section  [ sect : magnetometer ] .",
    "the variables are : electron or proton ; resonant polarimetry or scattering polarimetry ; simultantaneously circulating beams , or one - at - a - time beams ?",
    "koop rolling spin wheel or not ? ; what about the wien filter directional sensitivity ?",
    "far too many for this brief concluding section . fortunately , other than the essential difference between electron and proton rings , the same lattice designs will be applicable for all choices among the variables . here",
    "i will fix on the proton case , and the two configurations i currently consider most promising .",
    "though not mentioned so far , and not proven so far , the spin coherence time performance of the octupole - only ring is likely to be superior to any of the rings studied to date .",
    "this is because the lattice is closest to the pure @xmath106 cylindrical lattice for which , theoretically , the sct is infinite .",
    "the only blemish needing further study concerns the spin decoherence caused by the ( very weak ) octupole field .",
    "more important , because the @xmath2 spurious precession is the most serious source of systematic edm error , the octupole - only bottle storage ring , invented for the purpose , and described in this paper , seems to me to be obligatory .",
    "also for sufficiently high precision , digital frequency domain resonant polarimetry is obligatory .",
    "but resonant polarimetry requires the koop spin wheel rolling polarization , and _ rolling polarization requires a local wien filter which , because of its directionality , may rule out simultaneously counter - circulating beams . _ this seems to reduce the options down to single beams , alternating between cw and ccw runs , with @xmath2 compensation between runs .",
    "aspects of this design have been considered in section  [ sect : magnetometer ] .",
    "this edm experimental route has the potential for measuring a proton edm value as small , let us say@xcite , as @xmath107e - cm , probably limited by the systematic error caused by spurious mdm - induced precession in unknown residual radial magnetic field .",
    "the only known way to further reduce this systematic error is to have simultaneously counter - circulating beams ",
    "an option tentatively ruled out in the italicized sentence in the previous paragraph .",
    "the problem is that controlling the rolling polarization of even a single beam requires two wien filters .",
    "the wien filter with cancelling horizontal deflections is needed to keep the spin wheel of the polarized beam properly aligned without affecting the orbit at all because the electric and magnetic deflections cancel .",
    "but , acting on the counter - circulating beam , the electric and magnetic deflections add .",
    "fortunately even summed , this kick is a mere `` tickle '' .",
    "this wien filter is only cancelling the spin effects of unknown tiny radial deflections that , nominally , average to zero .",
    "furthermore , any beam growth or change in particle distribution induced in a counter - circulating beam by these kicks is horizontal . as such it has little or no tendency to introduce up - down asymmetry that could influence the edm measurement . in spite of its directionality ,",
    "this wien filter application is therefore probably harmless .",
    "the wien filter with cancelling vertical electric and magnetic deflections can not be taken so lightly .",
    "the spin kicks from this wien filter need to be at least strong enough to drive the koop spin wheel polarization roll , but without influencing the polarized beam orbits .",
    "furthermore , _ precise reversal _ of the polarization roll is essential for obtaining the edm measurement . this spin wheel reversal ,",
    "if applied by a wien filter , applies an uncompensated local vertical kick to the counter - circulating beam orbit , possibly producing effects mimicking the effect of particle edm .",
    "this is not good .",
    "i can think of only one way to fix this problem .",
    "it is to use the global @xmath93 circuit , rather than a local wien filter , to impose the rolling polarization .",
    "it has been explained in section  [ sect : magnetometer ] how , working with the @xmath108 compensation , the overall radial magnetic field average can be nulled with both beams centered vertically . from this perfectly balanced condition , a tiny shift of @xmath93 , adiabatically applied ,",
    "will introduce the required polarization roll .",
    "however a tiny vertical beam separation beween the counter - circulating beams will also occur ; it is an inevitable consequence of the radial magnetic field driving the roll .",
    "this separates the beam centroids everywhere in the ring .",
    "but the shift is miniscule and will be treated by correction .",
    "( vertical separation introduces a small systematic vertical `` force '' @xmath109 on one beam due to the other but , because the separation is small compared to the beam height , this will not alter the orbits significantly .",
    "_ there will , however , need to be a systematic correction for the mdm - induced spin precession due to the magnetic field of the other beam . _ )    otherwise there will be no significant perturbation of either counter - circulating beam distribution .",
    "this is because , unlike a local wien filter , the compensation circuit is global , and varies only adiabatically .",
    "for example , half way through each run @xmath93 will be slowly reversed as part of the edm measurement sequence .",
    "i conjecture that any spurious systematic edm signal caused by this sequence of operations can be corrected analytically with satisfactory accuracy .",
    "another issue to be faced is the `` incompatibility '' of simultaneously counter - circulating beams with resonant polarimetry ( which is itself delicate and , as yet , unproven ) .",
    "the resonant polarimeter is a highly tuned device whose response is only made detectible after millions of coherent bunch passages .",
    "the possiblility of separation bumps enabling the beams to pass through separate polarimeters has been contemplated . but",
    "this brings in complications too horrible to mention .",
    "so i take it as given that both beams have to pass through the same resonators and , in fact , the same everything !    two beams passing through a single resonator certainly represents a complication .",
    "another complication comes from the fact that each beam has many bunches , presumed to be equally spaced ; this is not new , but it is essential to the discussion . to simplify the discussion the rolling spin operation will be turned off for this discussion , returning to truly frozen spin operation , parallel , or anti - parallel to the beam orbits .    ideally one would wish to monitor and phase lock the beam polarizations of the two beams independently , but this is probably impossible .",
    "the beams are injected with independent errors , e.g. different energies , they pass through all the same elements , and there is no significant damping mechanism .",
    "the resonator itself can not distinguish between the beams .",
    "satisfying superposition , the resonator linearly superimposes the signals from all passing bunches , irrespective of their directions of travel .",
    "so resonant polarimeters in the ring simply register the coherent sum of the two beam polarizations .",
    "this coherent summing of the two beam polarizations may or may not be tolerable .",
    "but , even if not tolerable , there is a workaround .",
    "only one or the other of the cw and ccw beams needs to be polarized for the edm measurement .",
    "an unpolarized beam applies no magnetization signal at all to the polarimeter .",
    "so , running with one highly - polarized beam and one unpolarized beam , the polarimeter responds only to the polarized beam , as if there is a single beam .",
    "the unpolarized beam is `` inert '' .",
    "the unpolarized beam provides no edm information .",
    "its role is to facilitate the self - magnetometry .",
    "but it may also be possible for the inert beam to play another role . if the two beam currents are exactly equal ( which is not otherwise essential for self - magnetometry ) the net current through the magnetometer vanishes .",
    "it may be possible to take advantage of this to cancel the direct excitation of the resonator by the circulating beam currents .",
    "this would greatly relax one of the serious uncertainties concerning resonant polarimetry .",
    "this could , for example , permit the roll polarization frequency to be reduced from , say , 100hz to 1hz , while still permitting the polarization frequency line to be resolved from the nearby revolution harmonic .",
    "it is not clear whether this will work ; direct resonator excitation is more feared than understood at this time . like the magnetization response , the direct response is also the coherent sum of the responses to the separate beams .",
    "the opposite beam directions and the phase shifts through the resonator make it possible for the resonator to be excited even when the net beam current vanishes . by symmetry , arranging the resonator center to coincide with bunch crossing points will probably be either optimal or anti - optimal ; i.e. the superposition is either perfectly constructive or perfectly destructive .",
    "if anti - optimal , then placing the resonator midway between bunch crossings would be optimal .",
    "one only has to design the ring lattice and the rf phasing appropriately .    from this point of view counter - circulating beams",
    "may even be helpful for resonant polarimetry .",
    "certainly , this possibility requires further study .",
    "incidentally , it is already known@xcite , that beam - beam interaction of the counter - circulating beams has negligible detrimental effect on storage ring edm measurement .",
    "all this implies that simultaneously counter - circulating beams may be practical after all .",
    "this route has the potential for reducing the edm systematic error by a substantial factor  perhaps as much as a factor of ten .",
    "this depends on the relative seriousness of unknown radial magnetic fields and the extent to which problems associated with having two beams can be mastered .    *",
    "this appendix generalizes to relativistic magnetic traps formulas from , for example , a book by spitzer@xcite .",
    "results concerning such a relativistic magnetic trap are corroborated in the numerical simulations in figures  [ fig : mag_smsm.png ] , [ fig : mag_med.png ] , and [ fig : elecmagn - x ] .",
    "some of the formulas in this appendix have been used to include the effects of a very weak magnetic field in an otherwise purely electrostatic field ( not counting rf ) , which is the primary system investigated in the present paper .",
    "behavior of the relativistic all - electric trap emphasized in the present paper is qualitatively very similar to behavior of a magnetic trap .",
    "the dominant field in a magnetic bottle is @xmath110 , where the vector potential @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 in the present context `` longitudinal '' means vertical or @xmath20 , `` perpendicular '' means horizontal or @xmath19 .",

    "the closed line integral @xmath121 over one turn , @xmath122 is an adiabatic invariant of the gyration , conserved as the center of the particle s circular orbit moves along its field line .",
    "the single current orbit loop also has a magnetic moment equal to current times area ; @xmath123 which differs from @xmath121 only by a constant factor ( which does however include a factor @xmath33 ) .",
    "@xmath124 the product @xmath125 represents the energy the particle by virtue of its magnetic moment in the magnetic field .",
    "motion along the field line can be analysed using the constancy of @xmath121 . neglecting the longitudinal velocity , the kinetic energy of motion in the perpendicular plane",
    "is given by @xmath126 .",
    "but , because of its initial vertical velocity , a particle will drift vertically . since the magnetic field is non -",
    "uniform this will lead it into a region where @xmath118 is different .",
    "superficially this seems to contradict the constancy of @xmath121 , since the speed of a particle can not change in a pure magnetic field .",
    "it _ has to be _ that energy is transferred to or from motion in the longitudinal direction .",
    "we can analyse the longitudinal motion on the basis of energy conservation .",
    "when the magnitude of @xmath118 falls with @xmath127 constant , the transverse kinetic energy has to increase .",
    "this energy necessarily comes from the longitudinal kinetic energy , which falls .",
    "eventually a `` turning point '' is reached where the longitudinal energy vanishes . and the direction of motion of the guiding center along the field line reverses .",
    "even though the total velocity is relativistic , for our storage ring application , we can assume the vertical velocity @xmath128 can be treated non - relativistically , provided the particle rest mass is replaced by its inertial mass , larger by the factor @xmath33 .",
    "for purposes of studying its motion parallel to the magnetic field , the total longitudinal energy of a particle is then given by the non - relativistic formula @xmath129 here @xmath61 is the numerical value of the total energy ( kinetic plus magnetic ) of a particular particle being tracked .",
    "( the same symbol @xmath61 , with a similar meaning is employed in section  [ sect : fastslow ] to express the ( non - relativistic ) vertical energy of a proton in an electric bottle . )",
    "we have specialized from a general case in which the magnetic field depends only on one coordinate @xmath20 , rather than a general position @xmath130 . since the first term depends only on position",
    "@xmath20 it can be interpreted as potential energy .",
    "it is larger at either end of the trap than in the middle .",
    "since both @xmath131 and @xmath121 are conserved , this equation can be solved for the dependence of longitudinal velocity on position @xmath20 ; @xmath132 in a uniform field @xmath128 would be constant , but in a spatially variable field @xmath128 varies slowly .",
    "as the particle drifts toward the end of the trap , the @xmath118 field becomes stronger and @xmath128 becomes less . at some value @xmath133 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : magtrap.13 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this is therefore a `` turning point '' of the motion , and the guiding center is turned back to drift toward the center , and then the other end .",
    "perpetual longitudinal oscillation follows .",
    "but the motion may be far from simple harmonic , depending as it does on the detailed shape of @xmath134for example @xmath118 can be essentially constant over a long central region and then become rapidly larger over a short end region .",
