    "numerical simulations that reproduce the shapes of planetary nebulae ( pne ) have helped to understand or give insights into the basic physics acting behind the formation of the different morphologies that are commonly observed in pne . the two - wind model proposed by kwok ,",
    "purton & fitzgerlad ( 1978 ) has been applied and refined in a number of numerical simulations based on hydrodynamic models ( e.g. khan & west 1985 ; mellema , eulderink & icke 1991 ; frank & mellema 1994 ; dwarkadas , chevalier & blondin 1996 ) . during the last decade , though , it has become evident that the production of highly collimated , bipolar , supersonic outflows , play a major role in the evolution of a substantial number , if not all , of pne ( e.g. lpez 1997 for a review ) .",
    "the main nebular morphologies are usually well reproduced in the hydrodynamic models , however , the production of jets and ansae have met with certain difficulties ; in particular , fast winds do not tend to converge into stable structures to form ansae and jets ( e.g. dwarkadas & balick 1998 ) .    on a somewhat different approach , chevalier & luo ( 1994 )",
    "have explored the effects of a rotating star with a magnetized wind on the formation of aspherical bubbles . following this scheme , ryczka & franco ( 1996 ) and garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1999 ) , performed 2-d mhd simulations of this magnetized wind in cylindrical and spherical calculations , respectively , showing that magnetic tension may indeed be responsible for the generation of jets in pne .",
    "recently , garca - segura ( 1997 ) ( paper i ) presented full 3-d mhd models of pne where jets and ansae are convincingly reproduced as the result of magnetic collimation of the post - agb wind .",
    "a particularly intriguing case in pne morphologies are those that display point - symmetric structures .",
    "point - symmetry has been recognized in a wide variety of pne ( e.g. guerrero , vzquez & lpez 1998 ) . in some instances ,",
    "where reliable kinematical information is available , the presence of bipolar , rotating , episodic jets or brets have been inferred to explain similar structures ( c.f .",
    "lpez 1997 ) .",
    "cliffe et al . ( 1995 ) performed 3-d numerical simulations introducing in their computational mesh the presence of a bret and reproducing the main morphological features observed , in particular for the case of fleming 1 ( lpez , meaburn & palmer 1993 ) .",
    "they also noted that some bipolar nebulae , such as hb 5 present distinct , clumpy , s - shaped intensity distributions in their opposing lobes , which led them to argue that these structures could also be originated by a precessing jet .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in this paper have been mainly motivated by this group of objects , though the results expand a wide range of configurations , including the conditions for jet detection in pne , ansae formation in point - symmetric modes and ` regular ' bipolar and elliptical pne presenting some degree of asymmetry .    in   2",
    "we discuss the initial considerations and the motivation for the present paper .",
    "  3 describes the methodology .",
    "  4 presents results for bipolar nebulae and   5 for ellipticals . ",
    "6 discusses the results and a summary is given in   7 .",
    "as an illustration of the main type of morphological structures that are the focus of the present simulations , a mosaic of images of these type of nebulae is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the objects included in this representative sample are , ( 1a ) hb 5 , ( 1b ) he 2 - 103 , ( 1c ) he 2 - 429 and ( 1d ) ngc 2371 .",
    "hubble 5 is a bipolar nebula with distinct internal s - shaped intensity distribution .",
    "recent hst images of this object obtained by balick , icke and mellema show a great deal of detail in the secondary , tilted outflow .",
    "he 2 - 103 is an elliptical nebulae where the equatorial density enhancement is clearly not perpendicular to the elliptical shell ; furthermore , faint nebular extensions are discerned displaced from the main elliptical axis on both sides of the nebula .",
    "he 2 - 429 ( see guerrero et al .",
    "1998 and the iac catalog , manchado et al .",
    "1996 ) is an elliptical nebula with twisted , point - symmetric extensions protruding outside the main nebular shell .",
    "finally , ngc 2371 has a dumb - bell appearance with intensity maxima in the equator defining a minor axis which is not orthogonal to the main nebular axis .",
    "the main , standard , working hypothesis that sets the initial conditions of the simulations is that the equatorial density enhancement ( ede ) produced in the late agb phase defines the main symmetry axis of the bipolar / elliptical wind outflow , i.e. the ede is orthogonal to the main bipolar / elliptical structure .    in paper",
    "i , in order to reproduce point - symmetric structures , a wide binary nucleus was considered and the magnetic collimation axis ( i.e. the rotation axis of the primary star ) was assumed to precess , with a period of the same order of the kinematic age of the nebulae ( @xmath3 yr ) .    in the present paper , instead of invoking an active rotation of the magnetically collimated outflow ,",
    "a misaligned configuration is produced by introducing a steady tilt of the magnetic collimation axis with respect to the bipolar / elliptical wind outflow .",
    "hence , this is a particular case of paper i , in which the precession period is nule or much larger than the kinematic age of the nebula .",
    "thus , in order to achieve this steady misalignment , the rotating core of the agb , which will provide the magnetized fast wind , must have a rotation axis tilted with respect to the axis defined by the ede .",
    "our current limited understanding of the detailed processes that produce the ede at the agb phase precludes a full physical justification for this assumption .",
    "binary nuclei could represent the best way to attain this effect given the diversity of paths that they can take during their evolution through the agb ( e.g. yungelson , tutukov & livio 1993 ) .",
    "for example , wide binary systems may induce this misalignment since the ejected envelope s rotation axis of the primary star could be tidally altered by the secondary and the ede formed in the orbital plane , with a resulting tilt with respect to the rotation axis of the primary .",
    "alternatively , systems which undergo a common envelope evolution , in which the rotation axis of the primary star is not orthogonal to the orbital plane could also produce the same effect .",
    "close binary systems with substellar companions that may lead to the formation of accretion disks ( reyes - ruiz & lpez 1999 ) and mergers could also play a significant role here .",
    "however , beyond these arguments , which badly need additional investigation , the best initial justification that has motivated at this time further exploring of this assumption is the apparent asymmetry observed in the equatorial regions of a substantial number of pne and the corresponding point - symmetric condensations and shapes ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the numerical models do not consider an explicit physical form for the source of the wind , just an outflowing magnetized wind from a spherical radius of @xmath4 pc after t=0 .",
    "regions below this limit lie beyond the current resolution of the simulations .",
    "the general idea behind these mhd models is sketched in figure 2 . here",
    ", a rotating star produces the outflowing magnetized wind , in which the toroidal component of the magnetic field is dominant respect to the poloidal contribution at large distances .",
    "the simulations have been performed using the magneto - hydrodynamic code zeus-3d ( version 3.4 ) , developed by m. l. norman and the laboratory for computational astrophysics .",
    "this is a finite - difference , fully explicit , eulerian code descended from the code described in stone & norman ( 1992 ) .",
    "a method of characteristics is used to compute magnetic fields as described in clarke ( 1996 ) .",
    "zeus-3d does not include radiation transfer , but we have implemented a simple approximation to derive the location of the ionization front for arbitrary density distributions ( see bodenheimer 1979 ; franco 1989 , 1990 , garca - segura & franco 1996 ) .",
    "this is done by assuming that ionization equilibrium holds at all times , and that the gas is fully ionized inside the h  ii  region .",
    "the location of the ionization front in any given direction @xmath5 from the photoionizing source is given by @xmath6 , where symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "the models include the raymond & smith ( 1977 ) cooling curve above @xmath7 k. for temperatures below @xmath7 k , the shocked gas region is allowed to cool down with the radiative cooling curves given by dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) and macdonald & bailey ( 1981 ) . finally , the photoionized gas is always kept at @xmath7 k , so no cooling curve is applied to the hii regions ( unless , of course , there is a shock inside the photoionized region ) . the minimum temperature allowed in all models",
    "is set to @xmath8 k. the computations are done in cartesian coordinates ( x , y , z ) , with outflowing outer boundary conditions .",
    "the models have grids of @xmath9 equidistant zones , with an extent of @xmath10 pc in x , y and z respectively .",
    "the wind , whose origin is centered at the center of the computational volume , is set based on the rotating wind solutions given by bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) , ignace et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) and the approach to those equation given by garca - segura et al.(1999 ) .",
    "these equations permit the introduction of the wind self - consistently .",
    "for the reasons given in the preceding section , in the present calculations we do not address a particular functional shapes for the ede , but simply state its presence independently of its origin",
    ".    the magnetic field of an outflowing wind from a rotating star can be described by two components , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( chevalier & luo 1994 ; ryczka & franco 1996 ; paper i ; garca - segura et al .",
    "the radial field component can be neglected since @xmath13 while the toroidal component @xmath14 , and the field configuration obeys @xmath15 . in all the simulations ,",
    "the toroidal field is set always perpendicular to the z axis , therefore only @xmath16 and @xmath17 are introduced in the source wind sphere , with @xmath18 .    as in paper i",
    ", we will use two useful dimensionless parameters containing the basic information of the models .",
    "the first one @xmath19 is the velocity ratio of the stellar rotation to the critical rotation , and the second parameter @xmath20 is the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the kinetic energy density in the fast wind",
    ". the wind compression field ( `` wcfield '' ) found by ignace et al.(1998 ) is also introduced . however , since @xmath19 is less than 10% for the fast wind in all the calculations , this correction is of little relevance in these cases .",
    "the agb wind is set with a @xmath21 and a @xmath22 as a standard value in all the models .",
    "the agb wind is set unmagnetized in all models , because the estimated values for @xmath20 are very low in this regime ( see paper i ) .",
    "since we are interested in the early phases of the pn evolution , the velocity of the fast wind is set to @xmath2 .",
    "this value should reasonably match the conditions at the departure from the agb phase .",
    "a more realistic approach to this problem would need to include the evolving wind conditions with gradual transitions of the wind from @xmath23  up to @xmath24  ( or higher ) , and mass - loss rates varying from @xmath25  ( or higher ) down to @xmath26 ( or lower ) . in this case time",
    "dependent effects invoke additional behaviors on the dynamics ( e.g. dwarkadas & balick 1998 ) .",
    "they are out of the scope of the present paper and are deferred to a future work .",
    "the parameters of the runs are summarized in table 1 .",
    "these include , an unmagnetized reference case ( model a0 ) ; bipolars with different inclinations of the bipolar wind outflow symmetry axis with respect to the magnetic collimation axis and two different mass loss rates ( models b and c , respectively ) and ellipticals with a single constant tilt and three different mas loss rates ( models e )",
    "bipolar nebulae are mainly characterized by an equatorial waist with a substantial pole to equator density contrast . in order to achieve such a density contrast ,",
    "we have used a value of @xmath27 in the set up , which is obtained with a rotational velocity of 6.929  .      as a starting point ,",
    "the response of a spherically symmetric , unmagnetized wind starting from a spherical shape is shown in model a0 ( fig .",
    "this unmagnetized case shows how the wind behaves in such a medium , i.e. , the wind is impeded to expand in the equator due to the ede , but it easily expands along the polar direction",
    ". this would be the classical hydrodynamic case that has been thoroughly studied in the past ( c.f .",
    "see frank 1999 for a review on bipolar outflows ) .",
    "because of the radiative conditions of the reverse or terminal shock of such a wind in this set up ( @xmath28 k for @xmath29 ) , the bipolar bubble is momentum driven .",
    "this particular dynamics generates ram - ram pressure instabilities ( garca - segura et al .",
    "1996 ; garca - segura et al .",
    "1997b ) , however , given the low resolution of the grid , these instabilities are not reproduced in the present study , and only some indications of such a behavior is present as the small corrugation that appears in the lobes of model a0 .",
    "model a0 is important as a reference model since it shows that fast unmagnetized winds , starting from spherical conditions and expanding within an ede can not converge to form jets or ansae . in more adiabatic conditions , the lobes become two tangential spheres ( garca - segura et al .",
    "it is precisely this behavior that rules under the presence of an ede , i.e. the bipolar lobes will grow always perpendicular to the ede , and is the ede the responsible for the equatorial waist observed in bipolar nebulae .      keeping in mind the behavior of the reference model a0",
    ", a magnetized wind is now introduced to visualize the strong change that effects the dynamics .",
    "model b0 ( fig .",
    "3 ) only differs from model a0 in the magnetized wind , with a @xmath30 .",
    "but the result is remarkable , a pair of jets form at both sides in the lobes .",
    "the explanation of this behavior is fully described in ryczka & franco ( 1996 ) , and it results mainly from the action of the hoop stress caused by the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the rest of the bubble behaves now adiabatically because the magnetic pressure does not allow the gas to pile up towards the inner edges of the lobes .",
    "this is also the main reason why model b0 expands much faster than model a0 , since energy conserving bubbles in power laws of the type @xmath31 have different dynamics than momentum conserving bubbles ( garca - segura & mac low 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "although the hoop stress is always present in this type of flows , not always the conditions are in favor to form observable jets .",
    "such a case is computed in model c0 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , in which the mass - loss rate of the fast wind has been decreased by an order of magnitude . in such conditions , the fast wind piles up at the poles , but the radiative cooling , proportional to @xmath32 , is not sufficiently strong to allow the formation of visible jets , and ansae - like structures are formed instead . this difference is more evident in the synthetic pictures shown in figure 7 for models bs and cs , which are discussed further below .",
    "as mentioned before , the symmetry axis of the bipolar wind outflow is considered orthogonal to the ede .",
    "models b0 and c0 are computed with the magnetic collimation axis also orthogonal to the ede .",
    "the following models break this condition by introducing different tilts between these axes to explore the resultant effects , which are shown to lead to point - symmetric shapes .",
    "the tilt is introduced at the ede for simplicity .",
    "thus , the magnetic collimation axis remains parallel with the z axis , and the same set up described above is used for the magnetized wind .    in order to have a general picture of the effect caused by the tilt",
    ", we have computed several models in which the tilt angle varies from low values , @xmath33 ( models b5 and c5 ) , middle values , @xmath34 ( models b15 and c15 ) and large values , @xmath35 ( models b45 and c45 ) .",
    "the evolution of the two last models is shown in figures 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the dynamics of the bubbles in such conditions are quite complex and the limited resolution of the models hinder a full , quantitative description .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of the tilt can be summarize qualitatively as follows .",
    "at the beginning of every simulation , the spherically symmetric shocked flow is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient after crossing the reverse or terminal shock and is launched in the z direction on both sides of the wind source region . since the magnetic field is toroidal ,",
    "the magnetic pressure is nule towards the z axis in the free expanding wind ( but not in the shocked region ) , while it is maximum in the equatorial plane , consequently building a large pressure gradient .",
    "gradually , the flow notices the effect of the ede and is deflected perpendicular to it",
    ". the magnetically pressurized bubble is distorted , and the flow , which now follows the tendency of the bipolar cavity , pushes and deflects the column of gas in which the hoop stress is larger . when this column is dense enough",
    ", the formed jets are deflected an acquire the appearance of precessing jets , which eventually will collide with the bipolar cavity ( see e , g , model b45 ) .",
    "thus , there are two competing effects , one is the tendency of the gas to flow perpendicular to the ede , and the other is the tendency of the gas to flow parallel to the z axis as imposed by the magnetic pressure and the hoop stress . when the tilt is nule , i.e. , when both effects do not compete with each other , the bubble acquires the largest expansion velocity at the polar regions .",
    "elliptical nebulae are characterized by a moderate pole to equator density contrast .",
    "we have adopted a value of @xmath36 for the agb wind , which is obtained with a rotational velocity of 5.65  .",
    "the agb wind is set with a @xmath21 and a @xmath37 as a standard value for models e1 and e2 , while @xmath38 is used for e3 and e4 . the mass loss rate of the fast wind is varied from values of @xmath39 ( e1 ) to @xmath40 ( e3 and e4 ) .",
    "a tilt of @xmath34 is used in this case for all models for simplicity .",
    "an example of the model evolution is shown in fig . 6 for model e1 .",
    "the evolution is similar to the models described above for bipolar nebulae , with the difference that the bubble grows further at the equator since the ede is not as restrictive as before .",
    "figure 7 ( right panels ) shows the apparent differences between models e1 ,",
    "e2 , e3 and e4 , dictated by varying the mass loss rates of the fast wind from relatively large to lower values .",
    "the polar , piled - up gas in model e1 ( @xmath39 ) is able to cool down efficiently in a dynamical time scale comparable to the computed time and the axial jets become readily apparent . in model e2 ( @xmath41 )",
    "the cooling is less efficient but still present , giving rise to the formation of ansae - type structures .",
    "models e3 and e4 ( @xmath40 ) do not show any apparent signs of piled - up gas ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that given the limited numerical resolution of these models , the cooling regions are not resolved and the mass loss rates should be taken as estimative values .",
    "however , since these models have energy conserving dynamics ( as imposed by the magnetic pressure ) rather than momentum conserving , these estimations for the mass loss rates are quite independent of the terminal wind velocities . in the absence of a magnetic field , winds of the order of @xmath2 have strongly radiative terminal or reverse shocks ( see for example frank et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the radiative conditions are strongly dependent on the wind velocity and not only of the mass loss rate .",
    "in order to test the numerical results of the models , it would be convenient to run convergence tests at lower and higher resolution . the latter becomes prohibitively demanding for our computational resources .",
    "an experiment at half the resolution , which gives a qualitative indication on the reliability of the model is presented in figure 6b .",
    "this figure shows a comparison for model e1 with two different resolutions .",
    "althought , the individual details in both simulations in that figure differ by obvious reasons , the main features , such as the shape of the bubble and the formation and extension of the jets remain rather similar .",
    "the densities are larger in the high resolution run , indicating that in order to make quantitative estimates of physical parameters , one needs twice the resolution at least to be sure that the dynamics has been resolved , i.e. , to find a convergence .",
    "for example , what is the post - shock cooling length and how does this compare with the resolution of the simulations ?    in order to resolve a cooling distance , one needs basically to get @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the physical size of the grid , and @xmath44 the number of zones ( i.e. @xmath45 bigger than one zone ) .",
    "however , several zones are needed to resolve detailed cooling processes ( e.g. , any sort of microphysics ) . a rough estimate of the cooling timescales ,",
    "can be obtained from equilibrium line cooling . in this case , the cooling time of a parcel of shocked gas is given by @xmath46 yr ( franco 1994 ) , where @xmath47 cm s@xmath48 is the shock velocity , @xmath49 is the pre - shock mass gas density and @xmath50 is this density in units of @xmath51 @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath54 s@xmath55 g@xmath48 , and @xmath56 is the mass per particle in units of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 for a fully ionized gas with cosmic abundances ) . for typical numbers in our simulations ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath52 ) we obtain @xmath61 yr , which give us @xmath62 cm , just slightly smaller than the zone zise of @xmath63 cm .",
    "one should also consider that in mhd models conditions are such that cooling distances are more favourable resolved perpendicular to the field lines given the tendency to adiabatic behaviors in this case .    since the mhd simulations behave similar to the hydro solutions along the z axis ( parallel to the field lines ) , except for the extra pressure ( hoop stress ) that the magnetic field produces towards the rotation axis of the central star , it is possible to use the relations of conical converging flows ( cant , tenorio - tagle & ryczka 1988 ; or the specific solutions for ppne by frank , balick & livio 1996 ) , as an approximation for the parameters in the jets .",
    "this is in fact a conical converging , magnetized flow problem .",
    "thus , for example , the density in the jets can be estimated by following formula ( 23 ) in cant , tenorio - tagle & ryczka ( 1988 ) , where @xmath64 ^ 4 \\rho_{0 } $ ] .",
    "for the case of our e1 model , one gets ( for @xmath65 ) @xmath66 . on the other hand ,",
    "the computed models give @xmath67 for the low resolution run and @xmath68 for the higher resolution one .",
    "since the resolution is not big enough ( as discused above ) , and in both cases , @xmath69  , it is expected to find a jump of three orders of magnitude on the density ratio at twice the resolution , which would match the analytical value .",
    "the computational survey reveals that the formation of jets and ansae , or none , can be achieved by varying the mass - loss rate within a common framework of magnetized winds . in principle",
    "this would allow to have an estimate of the mass - loss rates involved in the formation of the different types of collimated outflows found in pne .",
    "in particular , it is found that for the formation and detection of jets , the mass - loss rates must have values @xmath70 . in the case of ansae a @xmath71 is required . below these values , i.e. for typical cases of @xmath72 or lower ,",
    "no collimated features are formed or revealed by the models .",
    "these numbers , however , must be taken with caution given the low resolution used in these 3-d calculations .",
    "nevertheless , there are additional studies that indicate that jets in pne must be formed during a brief lapse of high mass - loss rate in the pre - planetary nebula stage .",
    "for example , reyes - ruiz & lpez ( 1999 ) have concluded that when an accretion disk is involved in the formation of collimated outflows in pne , the necessary high accretion rates , @xmath73 , needed to launch an axis - symmetric wind ( as in the case of young stellar objects , e.g. calvet 1998 ) are attained only for a few thousand years during the late agb or pre - planetary phase .",
    "figure 7 shows different models in which jets have formed .",
    "the projected shapes in the tilted cases give the impression of a varying direction in the outflow , closely resembling the point - symmetric structures often observed in a number of pne .",
    "however here , no active precession or rotation in the source of the outflows is involved .",
    "these shapes result by the steady misalignment of the magnetized wind s axis with respect to the axis of the bipolar wind outflow .",
    "this configuration can lead to a hydrodynamical deflection of the magnetized wind on the bipolar cavity .",
    "this is a novel feature revealed by the simulations and which can be tested in the future by detailed kinematical and spectropolarimetric studies .",
    "for example , in this case the deflected gas is expected to show a kinematic behavior that deviates from the rest of the nebular expansion and line emission in the magnetically collimated regions to show polarization effects .",
    "hydrodynamical deflection can only account for s - shaped morphologies , helicoidal type structures would require some sort of rotation or wobbling from the wind source .",
    "although the pne that were originally classified as point - symmetric comprise a very reduced group , the presence of point - symmetric structures in pne has been shown now to span a much wider sample ( guerrero , vzquez & lpez 1998 ) .",
    "for example , signatures of point - symmetry can be appreciated in nearly 20% of the sample contained in the iac morphological catalog ( manchado et al .",
    "furthermore , practically every pn that has been recently observed at high spatial resolution with the hubble space telescope shows some degree of point - symmetry , indicating that the mechanisms that produce it should be rather common .",
    "the representative models shown in figures 2 - 7 reveal the variety of point - symmetric configurations that can be formed under the assumptions and conditions of the present study .",
    "the inclusion of binary nuclei in this analysis can only but strengthen the conditions for the development of point - symmetry .",
    "we have made a computational survey of 3-d mhd simulations of young planetary nebulae in which are introduced different steady misalignments of the magnetic collimation axis with respect to the symmetry axis of the bipolar / elliptical wind outflow .",
    "the latter defined as perpendicular to the equatorial density enhancement .",
    "this steady tilt can also be interpreted as the result of a very large precession period .",
    "the simulations show that in these cases a hydrodynamical deflection of the magnetized collimated wind on the bipolar / elliptical cavity can produce morphologies which may resemble the presence of precessing or rotating sources . in this way ,",
    "the resulting morphologies are able to reproduce a considerable number of pne which present some degree of point - symmetry in their structures .",
    "the survey also suggests that the formation and detection of jets and ansae , or none , strongly depends on the mass - loss rate of the driving , magnetized wind .",
    "in particular , the presence of jets is detected in the models only for mass - loss rates @xmath70 ; below these rates the jets tend to vanish in the models , keeping for @xmath71 only ansae type structures .",

    "<S> this work presents three dimensional , magneto - hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and early evolution of a subgroup of planetary nebulae that exhibit a variety of point - symmetric structures . for bipolar nebulae </S>",
    "<S> , the formation of point - symmetric nebular shapes along the inner borders of their opposing lobes and/or collimated outflows or jets internal or external to their cavities , is reproduced by considering a steady misalignment of the magnetic collimation axis with respect to the symmetry axis of the bipolar wind outflow , defined perpendicular to the equatorial density enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> elliptical planetary nebulae with ansae displaced from the symmetry axis in point - symmetric fashion are reproduced through the same process by reducing the equatorial density enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism represents an alternative explanation to some cases where morphological appearances give the impression of the action of a symmetric , rotating or precessing jet from the central source . </S>",
    "<S> the computational survey reveals that jet formation is detected only for dense enough winds with mass loss rates @xmath0  . for lower mass loss rates </S>",
    "<S> the jets tend to vanish leaving behind only ansae - like structures at the tips of the lobes , as observed in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> the results are rather independent of the wind terminal velocity , since magnetized bubbles behave adiabatically for low wind velocities ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) , which in the absence of a magnetic field would behave as momentum driven . </S>"
