    "following the success of the bogoliubov theory  @xcite in providing a microscopic explanation of superfluidity , much theoretical work has been devoted to the understanding of the infrared behavior and the calculation of the one - particle green function of a bose superfluid  @xcite .",
    "early attempts to improve the bogoliubov approximation encountered difficulties due to a singular perturbation theory plagued by infrared divergences  @xcite . although these divergences cancel out in local gauge invariant physical quantities ( condensate density , goldstone mode velocity , etc . )",
    ", they do have a definite physical origin : they reflect the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility which is induced by the coupling between transverse ( phase ) and longitudinal fluctuations .",
    "this is a general phenomenon  @xcite in systems with a continuous broken symmetry as discussed at the end of this section .    using field - theoretical diagrammatic methods to handle the infrared divergences of the perturbation theory , nepomnyashchii and nepomnyashchii ( nn ) showed that one of the fundamental quantities of a bose superfluid , the anomalous self - energy @xmath10 , vanishes in the limit @xmath11 in dimension @xmath12 , even though the low - energy mode remains phonon - like with a linear spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this exact result shows that the bogoliubov approximation , where the linear spectrum and the superfluidity rely on a finite value of the anomalous self - energy , breaks down at low energy .",
    "an alternative approach to superfluidity , based on a phase - amplitude representation of the boson field , has been proposed by popov  @xcite .",
    "this approach is free of infrared singularity , but restricted to the ( low - momentum ) hydrodynamic regime and therefore does not allow to study the high - momentum or high - frequency regime where the bogoliubov approximation is expected to be valid",
    ". nevertheless , popov s theory  @xcite agrees with the asymptotic low - energy behavior of @xmath10 obtained by nn  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the expression of the anomalous self - energy obtained by nn and popov in the low - energy limit yields a continuum of ( one - particle ) excitations coexisting with the bogoliubov sound mode  @xcite , in marked contrast with the bogoliubov theory where the sound mode is the sole excitation at low energy .",
    "the instability of the bogoliubov fixed point in dimension @xmath12 towards a different fixed point characterized by the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility has been confirmed by castellani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . using the ward identities associated to the local gauge symmetry and a renormalization group approach",
    ", these authors obtained the exact infrared behavior of a bose superfluid at zero temperature .",
    "related results , both at zero  @xcite and finite  @xcite temperature have been obtained by several authors within the framework of the non - perturbative renormalization group .    in this paper , we study a weakly interacting bose superfluid at zero temperature using the so - called bmw nprg scheme introduced by blaizot , mndez - galain and wschebor  @xcite . compared to more traditional rg approaches , the nprg approach presents a number of advantages : i ) symmetries are naturally implemented ( by a proper ansatz for the effective action or the two - point vertex ( sec .  [ sec_ea ] ) ) and ward identities are naturally satisfied ; ii ) the nprg approach is not restricted to the low - energy asymptotic behavior but can deal with all energy scales . in particular , it relates physical quantities at a macroscopic scale to the parameters of the microscopic model ; iii ) the bmw scheme enables to obtain the full momentum and frequency dependence of the correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "in the nprg approach , the main quantities of interest are the average effective action @xmath13 ( the generating functional of one - particle irreducible vertices ) and its second - order functional derivative , the two - point vertex @xmath14 , whose inverse gives the one - particle propagator ( sec .",
    "[ sec_ea ] ) .",
    "fluctuations beyond the bogoliubov approximation are gradually taken into account as the ( running ) momentum scale @xmath15 is lowered from the microscopic scale @xmath16 down to zero . in sec .",
    "[ sec_de ] , we show that the infrared behavior of the one - particle propagator is entirely determined by the ward identities associated to the galilean and local gauge invariances of the microscopic action , and the exponent @xmath8 characterizing the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility ( see the discussion at the end of the introduction ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec_rg ] we derive the bmw flow equations satisfied by the two - point vertex @xmath17 and obtain the analytical solution in the infrared regime .",
    "numerical results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_nr ] .",
    "we find that the bogoliubov approximation breaks down at a characteristic momentum length @xmath0 ( `` ginzburg '' scale ) which , for weak boson - boson interactions , is much smaller than the inverse healing length @xmath18 ( @xmath18 is defined in appendix [ app_bog ] ) . although local gauge invariant quantities are not sensitive to @xmath0 , the effective action @xmath13 is attracted to a fixed point characterized by the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility when @xmath19 .",
    "we discuss in detail the frequency and momentum dependence of the two - point vertex @xmath20 .",
    "while for @xmath21 or @xmath22 ( with @xmath2 the velocity of the bogoliubov sound mode ) , @xmath20 is well described by the bogoliubov approximation , we reproduce the low - energy asymptotic behavior obtained by nn when @xmath3 . in this regime ,",
    "the longitudinal correlation function becomes singular and its spectral function exhibits a continuum of one - particle excitations in agreement with the predictions of popov s hydrodynamic theory .",
    "thus our approach provides a unified picture of superfluidity in interacting boson systems and connects bogoliubov s theory to popov s hydrodynamic theory . in the conclusion ,",
    "we comment about a possible extension of our results to strongly interacting or one - dimensional superfluids .",
    "since the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility plays a key role in the infrared behavior of interacting boson systems , we first discuss this phenomenon both in classical and quantum systems ( for a pedagogical discussion , see also ref .",

    "contrary to the predictions of gaussian theory [ eq .  ( [ cor1 ] ) ] , the longitudinal susceptibility is not finite but diverges for @xmath48 when @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "this divergence is weaker than that of the transverse propagator for all dimensions larger than the lower critical dimension @xmath50 .",
    "the appearance of a singularity in the longitudinal channel , driven by transverse fluctuations , is a general phenomenon in systems with a continuous broken symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the momentum scale @xmath0 below which the gaussian approximation ( [ cor1 ] ) breaks down is exponentially small for @xmath47 ( and @xmath51 ) and of order @xmath52 for @xmath46 ( see appendix [ subsec_kg ] for the estimation of @xmath0 in a bose superfluid ) .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from the nprg analysis of the ordered phase of the linear model ( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "the nprg predicts the coupling constant to scale as @xmath53 where @xmath15 is a running momentum scale  @xcite .",
    "this scaling follows from the flowing of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath54 to a finite value @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 for @xmath47 ) .",
    "the longitudinal propagator then diverges as @xmath58 and , identifying @xmath15 with @xmath59 to extract the @xmath60 dependence of the propagator , we reproduce ( [ cor3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the divergence ( [ cor3 ] ) of the longitudinal susceptibility is a consequence of the fixed point structure of the rg flow in the ordered phase of the linear model ( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "these considerations easily generalize to a quantum model with the euclidean action s = d^dr ( ) ^2 + c^-2()^2 + v ^2 + ( ^2)^2 , [ action3 ] where @xmath61 is an imaginary time varying between 0 and the inverse temperature @xmath62 , and @xmath2 the velocity of the goldstone mode . at zero temperature",

    ", it can be justified either from an effective low - energy description based on the ( quantum ) non - linear @xmath33 model or directly from the linear model ( [ action3 ] ) .",
    "after analytical continuation @xmath67 , the transverse propagator @xmath68 exhibits a pole at @xmath69 . on the contrary , @xmath64 has no pole - like structure but a branch cut which yields a critical continuum of excitations lying above the goldstone mode energy @xmath70 .",
    "this continuum results from the decay of a normally massive amplitude mode with momentum @xmath60 into a pair of transverse excitations with momenta @xmath71 and @xmath72  @xcite .",

    "although the action of non - relativistic bosons differs from the relativistic - type action ( [ action3 ] ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ action4 ] ) below ) , the preceding conclusions regarding the longitudinal propagator still hold in the superfluid phase .",
    "the reason is that the argument leading to ( [ cor4 ] ) relies on the existence of a goldstone mode with linear dispersion @xmath70 rather than the precise form of the microscopic action .",
