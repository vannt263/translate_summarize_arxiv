    "the existence of hot gas halos around many elliptical galaxies presents something of an enigma .",
    "how were they created and why do they not exist in all cases ? supernovae are supposed to provide the energy to heat up an existing gas reservoir , which could originate from stellar mass loss or from externally accreted gas .",
    "this heating process would require a large amount of energy to heat the quantities of gas , detected in x - rays , to the required temperatures ( few @xmath4 10@xmath5 k ) .",
    "once heated , the gas may form a hot halo around the galaxy , or escape the potential well of the galaxy in a wind , or take part in cooling flows , particularly rapid near the denser central regions of the galaxy ( pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ; fabian et al .",
    "2002 ; daisuke , yun & mihos 2004 ) . another possibility for the gas origin is from the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) in spiral galaxies if the hot gas halos formed when they merged .",
    "however , previous work showed that there is an unexpected dearth of gas , either cold or hot , in young , early - type galaxies ( e and s0 galaxies ) . results from the einstein and rosat satellites indicated that dynamically young , early - type galaxies are x - ray poor compared to other early - type galaxies ( fabbiano & schweizer 1995 ; sansom , hibbard & schweizer 2000 ; osullivan , forbes & ponman 2001a , hereafter ofp01a ) .",
    "hibbard & sansom ( 2003 ) studied 5 of these dynamically young , early - type galaxies in neutral hydrogen ( hi ) , with the vla and found very low upper limits to the mass of cold gas present in these systems ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "chang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found a similar result for e+a galaxies , thought to be recent merger products , with only one out of 5 galaxies detected in hi .",
    "georgakakis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that the hi content of young merger remnants decreases in the first 1 to 2 gyrs following a merger , after which there is little detectable change in hi content towards evolved ellipticals .",
    "more recently xilouris et al .",
    "( 2004a ) studied the dust content along a sequence of merging systems with dynamically estimated ages .",
    "they found that the warm - to - cold dust mass ratio increased along this sequence indicative of changing star formation and dust content in ongoing mergers .",
    "ofp01a looked at x - ray emission in early - type galaxies versus their luminosity weighted age estimated from optical spectroscopy ( terlevich & forbes 2002 , hereafter tf02 ) . from optical spectroscopy",
    "the luminosity weighted age is likely to indicate the age of the last major gaseous merger / accretion , since the luminosity weighting is dominated by the latest star formation .",
    "ofp01a showed that ellipticals with younger luminosity weighted ages were generally weaker x - ray sources , when normalised by their optical luminosity .",
    "note that optical luminosity fades only slowly for stellar populations older than about a gyr , as we illustrate later in this paper .",
    "these previous studies made use of simplistic characterisations of the overall x - ray properties of early - type galaxies , since the signal - to - noise or spectral sampling of the x - ray observations was generally low . with the advent of more sensitive x - ray missions , such as asca , xmm - newton and chandra , the increased",
    "signal - to - noise and broader spectral range allows us to investigate the x - ray properties of early - type galaxies in more detail .",
    "asca observations revealed that elliptical galaxies generally require two spectral components to describe their x - ray emission ( matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ; white , sarazin & kulkarni 2002 ) .",
    "these originate from diffuse gas ( described by a soft thermal component at kt@xmath7 0.2 to 1 kev ) and from a population of low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) stars ( with higher energy emission that can be described by a power - law with flux @xmath8 frequency@xmath9 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on three early - type galaxies ( ngc 4382 , ngc 5363 and ngc 2865 ) which are thought to be young .",
    "the aim is to measure the levels of different contributions to the x - ray emission . in particular , we focus on determining the contributions from hot gas .    in this paper",
    "we employ galaxy ages. briefly , such ages are derived from a longslit , optical spectrum of the galaxy centre . the lick system ( e.g. trager 2004 and references therein ) defines 25 absorption lines that can be measured from the spectrum and corrected onto the same basis as the original work ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) .",
    "comparison of the resulting indices to single age , single metallicity stellar populations can break the age - metallicity degeneracy to give independent , luminosity - weighted age and metallicity estimates . in our case",
    "we use the multi - line @xmath10 fitting method of proctor & sansom ( 2002 ) .",
    "it should be recognised that the resulting ages are applicable only to the central regions , typically 1/8 to 1/2 of the galaxy effective radius ( r@xmath0 ) . in general galaxy centres",
    "will contain a complex mix of stellar population ages .",
    "any young stellar population present will be brighter than an old population . thus the derived luminosity - weighted age for the galaxy centre",
    "will infact be an upper limit to the mean age of the central stars .",
    "the youngest stars were formed in a starburst event that may have been triggered by gas accretion onto the galaxy centre by an interaction or merger .",
    "forbes , ponman & brown ( 1998 ) showed that the spectroscopic age was similar to the time since a merger for a small sample of morphologically disturbed galaxies . thus such ages provide an indication of the time since the last interaction or merger , but not necessarily about when the bulk of the galaxy s stars formed .",
    "this will depend on the ( unknown ) fraction of mass involved in the young stellar population .",
    "this paper is set out in the following way .",
    "section 2 describes the targets and their observations .",
    "sections 3 presents their x - ray properties derived from spectral fitting of xmm - newton and chandra data .",
    "sections 4 describes analysis of the x - ray surface brightness profile and limits on the mass distribution in ngc 4382 , from combined xmm - newton and archival chandra data . section 5 sets these results into broader context with x - ray data from other early - type galaxies that also have age estimates . conclusions are given in section 6 .    throughout this paper , we normalise optical @xmath11-band luminosities to the @xmath11-band luminosity of the sun , l@xmath12=5.2@xmath410@xmath13 ergs s@xmath14 , and assume h@xmath15=75  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 .",
    "abundances are measured relative to the ratios of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "while these have now been superseded by more recent measurements , their use provides continuity with previous studies .",
    "we aimed for a sample of early - type galaxies with evidence of young ages in order to study their x - ray emission components in detail .",
    "targets were selected from the x - ray catalogue of early - type galaxies of osullivan , forbes & ponman ( 2001b , hereafter ofp01b ) .",
    "the generally faint nature of the x - ray fluxes from early - type galaxies means that sensitive instrumentation is required to measure the various contributions to the x - ray flux , from spectral fitting .",
    "a broad spectral range and good spectral resolution are also required .",
    "the most sensitive x - ray observatory currently available is xmm - newton .",
    "therefore we selected four nearby cases thought to be young , early - type galaxies and were awarded time for two of them on xmm - newton , ngc  4382 and ngc  5363 .",
    "we also made use of an archival chandra observation of ngc  4382 and an additional young galaxy , ngc 2865 , observed with chandra is also reported in this paper .",
    "these three galaxies are described below and their optical properties are summarised in table  1 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ngc 4382 was known from previous observations .",
    "einstein observations showed it to be a moderate luminosity x - ray source with ( log(l@xmath1)=40.33 erg s@xmath14 for @xmath16 = 75 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "it was then observed as an x - ray faint , early - type galaxy , with rosat ( fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1994 ) .",
    "more recently it was observed with chandra by sivakoff , sarazin & irwin ( 2003 ) , who resolved 58 point sources within the galaxy , attributed mostly to lmxbs .",
    "they also detected some diffuse gas at kt@xmath17 and uncertain abundance .",
    "ngc 4382 is a lenticular galaxy that follows a de vaucouleurs ( r@xmath18 law ) optical surface brightness profile ( baggett , baggett & anderson 1998 ) .",
    "no neutral hydrogen gas is detected in this galaxy ( hibbard & sansom 2003 ) .",
    "it is interacting with ngc 4394 , both in the virgo cluster .",
    "it has a large quantity of morphological fine structure , which points towards a dynamically young age ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) .",
    "the luminosity weighted age of its stellar population was also estimated to be young ( 1.6@xmath19 0.3 gyr ) from optical spectral absorption lines , as listed in the age catalogue of terlevich & forbes ( tf02 ) , see http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/dforbes .",
    "its deviation from the fundamental plane also suggests it is very young ( forbes , ponman & brown 1998 ) .",
    "results from einstein observations of ngc 5363 reveal a moderate x - ray luminosity of log(l@xmath1)=40.14 erg s@xmath14 ( ofp01b ) .",
    "this galaxy has been classified in various ways , including irregular and peculiar .",
    "however morphological classification based on recent , mid - infrared maps gives an e / s0pec class ( pahre et al .",
    "2004 ) and the galaxy follows an r@xmath18 profile ( xilouris et al 2004b ) .",
    "ngc 5363 is a non - interacting pair with ngc 5364 , which is 14.5 arcmins away .",
    "ngc 5363 was thought to be a young system , from its strong h@xmath20 absorption line . from optical spectroscopy denicol",
    "( 2005 ) estimate the age in the central regions to be 3.8 @xmath21 gyr .",
    "they used only four spectral line - strengths to estimate the age ( h@xmath20 versus the composite index [ mgfe ] ) . later in this paper",
    "we attempt a new age estimate using more data ( see section 5.1 ) .",
    "ngc 5363 has a dust lane along its minor axis , which shows up in mid - infrared observations ( xilouris et al . 2004b ) . from observations with the infrared space observatory ( iso )",
    "it contains a dust mass of @xmath22 m@xmath23 ( temi et al .",
    "if the gas - to - dust mass ratio is similar to that in our galaxy , this implies a total gas mass of at least @xmath24 m@xmath23 in the ism . the gas - to - dust mass ratio in early - type galaxies may be more than this ( @xmath73000 , with large scatter , from the ism catalogue of bettoni , galletta & garcia - burillo 2003 ) . with this gas - to - dust ratio",
    "the total gas mass in ngc 5363 could be @xmath25 m@xmath23 .",
    "we discuss qualitatively whether this is detected in the x - ray observations in section 3.1 and section 6 .",
    "there was an upper limit on the x - ray flux from ngc 2865 , of @xmath26 erg s@xmath14 @xmath27 , from rosat all sky survey data ( ofp01b ) , implying a luminosity limit of log(l@xmath1)@xmath28 erg s@xmath14 .",

    "2005 find low ( l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) for their model post - merger when compared to elliptical galaxies of similar l@xmath2 . in either example model",
    "the post - merger values are comparable with the highest observed detections around those times ( @xmath42 gyrs after coalescence ) .",
    "therefore the models appear to slightly over predict the hot gas components present in post - merger galaxies .",
    "thus the observations can constrain the reality of models .",
    "the range of possible model behaviours needs further investigation , plus extension to older systems , to test the expected x - ray evolution of galaxies resulting from mergers .",
    "the b band luminosity is very sensitive to young stars .",
    "the k band is more representative of the underlying stellar mass in a galaxy .",
    "therefore in fig .",
    "8 we have plotted the x - ray luminosity normalised by the k band luminosity .",
    "we used total k band magnitudes from the 2mass survey , where available . for the 2mass k band",
    "we assume ( v - k)@xmath23=1.45 ( toft , soucail & hjorth 2003 ) , m@xmath43=+4.82 , and a zero point flux calibration of k=0 for a flux of f@xmath3=1.122@xmath44 j s@xmath14 @xmath27 ( cohen et al .",
    "this gives an apparent k - band magnitude of k@xmath23=-28.20 and a luminosity of l@xmath45=6.03@xmath46 erg s@xmath14 .",
    "predicted x - ray evolution is shown ( cox et al .",
    "2005 ) , assuming a constant l@xmath47 erg s@xmath14 estimated from the galaxy data at @xmath38 gyr .",
    "this prediction also includes an estimate of the discrete source contribution to the x - rays .",
    "8 shows a similar trend as seen in fig .  7 , confirming the relatively low x - ray flux levels in post - merger systems .",
    "note that figs .",
    "7 and 8 exclude the exceptionally x - ray bright cd galaxy , ic 5358 , which has a spectroscopic age of 16 gyr and log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2)=0.0 .      the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "7 give an indication of the level expected from stellar contributions only and its uncertainty . within this uncertainty fig .",
    "7 indicates very little hot gas in e and s0 galaxies younger than about 4 gyrs .",
    "massive hot gas halos only appear to occur in older early - type galaxies . in figs .  7 and 8 we have plotted a fading starburst , using the code described in sansom & proctor ( 1998 ) .",
    "the level of optical fading even from a short , intense burst , is insufficient to account for this result .",
    "the evolution of the x - ray luminosity of the x - ray binary population is not well understood .",
    "hmxbs will dominate in the few hundred myr after the merger , and probably help to produce the peak in x - ray luminosity seen around age=0 , but their contribution will rapidly decline with the population of high mass stars . in the long term ,",
    "lmxbs will dominate , but the evolution of the integrated luminosity of the population over many gyr is not well understood .",
    "a factor @xmath76 increase would be required to explain the general trend we see , and this seems unlikely .",
    "note that ages greater than about 10 gyrs are very uncertain and some may be biased by emission line filling .",
    "any galaxies with estimated ages greater than 13 gyrs are therefore plotted at 13 gyrs in fig .  7 and fig .  8 to avoid stretching the age scale unrealistically .",
    "most of the galaxies in ofp01b had ages uncertain by @xmath48% .",
    "the presence of an accreting central black hole may provide a good explanation of the gas - poor state of post - merger galaxies , since it can act to drive a strong wind , as shown in the model of cox et la .",
    "if the wind is sufficient to expel the gas then the halo building stage will be delayed until enough new ism gas is built up from stellar mass loss .",
    "return of gas from post - merger tidal features ( modelled by hibbard & mihos 1995 ) can not account for the hot gas halos since post - merger galaxies are both x - ray poor ( see figs .",
    "7 and 8) and show little evidence for cold gas ( sansom et al .",
    "2000 ) . therefore hot gas halos may instead be built up from stellar mass loss in the post - merger phase .",
    "this may lead to a more metal enriched ism than in the case of returning , pre - existing gas , since the mass loss would be from more metal enriched stars .",
    "future requirements to test this picture will include examining hot gas properties and stellar x - ray components separately , versus age .",
    "this can only be done when accurate and consistent x - ray spectral fits have been made for enough cases , from data covering a broad waveband to avoid uncertain extrapolations .",
    "data mining xmm - newton and chandra archives will allow this to be done .",
    "to date , most published papers on large galaxy samples , observed using these satellites , do not give sufficient information to do this ( e.g. white et al .",
    "2002 ; diehl & statler 2005 ) .",
    "some such data are starting to appear ( e.g. fukazawa et al .",
    "2006 ) , but more is needed to map properties with age .",
    "the effects of environment have not been considered here , but this should also be important to do for a more homogeneous data set in future .",
    "three early - type galaxies , with young stellar populations , were observed with xmm - newton or chandra .",
    "two ( ngc 5363 and ngc 2865 ) are dominated by stellar contributions to the x - ray emission and the other ( ngc 4382 ) has roughly equal flux contributions from stellar and hot gas components .",
    "thus we do detect low levels of hot gas in these spectroscopically young , early - type galaxies , confirming previously published results . a revised",
    ", older age was found from re - analysis of optical spectra for ngc 5363 , using more spectral indices .",
    "an attempt was made to recover the mass distribution in ngc 4382 , which indicates an extended mass distribution , not bounded by the optical or x - ray light , however the gaseous halo is only detected out to @xmath49 kpc ( @xmath7 4r@xmath0 ) radius . in ngc 4382",
    "there is a gas mass of @xmath50 m@xmath23 within this radius .",
    "in contrast , ngc 5363 is at a similar distance , but has about a factor of three less flux in the thermal component , so is likely to possess correspondingly less hot gas .",
    "therefore there is no strong evidence for the quantities of gas expected from the observed dust mass , assuming gas - to - dust mass ratios typically measured for early - type galaxies . for ngc 4382",
    "the mass - to - light ratio in the galaxy core is consistent with stars being the dominant form of mass , but the mass profile rises with radius , suggesting an increasing dark matter contribution .",
    "therefore this spectroscopically youthful system appears to possess a dark matter halo .",
    "data from the literature , together with new data presented in this paper , were compiled for merging and early - type galaxies with measured , normalised x - ray emission ( log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) ) and estimated ages .",
    "this compilation of data confirms that there is a drop in x - ray emission for relatively young , early - type galaxies and illustrates that this drop extends up to @xmath51 gyr in age .",
    "this is confirmed in the log(l@xmath1/l@xmath3 ) versus age plane .",
    "the most likely explanation is that wind activity , fuelled by star formation and possible agn activity , causes a lack of hot gas in post merger galaxies .",
    "future work will investigate the origin of this behaviour , through separate x - ray spectral components , for a large , uniformly analysed sample .",
    "we thank a.read for advice on xmm - newton analysis and b. maughan for use of his sigma - clipping software .",
    "we thank t. ponman for help obtaining the ngc 2865 data and t. cox for sending us results of his simulations prior to publication .",
