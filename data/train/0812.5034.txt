    "in the last few years , a huge collective effort has been directed to assess potential performance of quasi-1d field effect transistors ( fets ) based on carbon nanotubes  @xcite ( cnts ) , silicon nanowires  @xcite ( snws ) , graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) versus the international technology roadmap for semiconductors  @xcite ( itrs ) requirements , both from an experimental and a theoretical point of view . however",
    ", attention has been focused on electrical quantities like @xmath0 , subthreshold slope , mobility , transconductance  @xcite , while an accurate investigation of electrical noise has been often neglected .",
    "although the 1/f noise represents the major noise source affecting cnt - fets performance  @xcite , the intrinsic shot noise is not only critical from an analog and digital design point of view , but can also provide relevant information regarding interactions among carriers  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite , electron energy distribution  @xcite  @xcite and electron kinetics  @xcite .    due to the limited device dimensions , even in strong inversion only few electrons take part to transport , so that drain current fluctuations",
    "can heavily affect device electrical behavior .",
    "pauli and coulomb interactions play an important role in noise analysis , through fluctuations of the occupation number of injected states and fluctuations of the potential barrier along the channel .    from a numerical point of view , a self - consistent solution of the electrostatics and transport equations is mandatory in order to properly consider such effects .",
    "an analysis of this kind has been performed for example in double gate mosfets  @xcite and in nanoscale ballistic mosfets  @xcite , where a strong shot noise suppression , mostly due to pauli exclusion principle , has been observed .",
    "a different approach , based on quantum trajectories within the de broglie - bohm framework has been instead presented in  @xcite , where resonant tunneling diodes have been studied and heavy approximations have been adopted in order to easily consider electron - electron correlation in the many - body problem .    actually , a complete understanding of the mechanism of suppression of shot noise in cnt and snw - fets is still a debated issue .",
    "indeed , the significant suppression of current fluctuations by more than a factor 100 obtained at low temperature for suspended ropes 0.4 @xmath1 m long of single wall carbon nanotubes  @xcite has not been supported by a comprehensive theoretical analysis .",
    "recent experiments of shot noise in cnt - based fabry perot interferometers  @xcite show that by only including pauli exclusion one is able to explain most of the dependence of shot noise on the backgate bias , but in some bias conditions additional mechanisms of electron - electron interaction might be needed to explain the observed noise suppression .",
    "theoretical efforts have been mainly addressed to model the electrical noise in snw - fets , where , within a scattering approach with the limitation of excluding space - charge effects on electron transmission , pauli exclusion reduces electrical noise in strong inversion down to 0.6% of the full value for a gate overdrive of 0.3  v  @xcite , whereas an interesting increase of noise is observed by including electron - phonon scattering processes  @xcite .    here , we present a new method to compute the shot noise power spectral density in ballistic cnt and snw - fets based on monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of randomly injected electrons from the reservoirs . in order to consider correlations between fermions ,",
    "an analytical formula for the noise power spectral density has been computed by means of a statistical approach within the second quantization formalism .",
    "the derived formula has then been implemented in the self - consistent solution of the 3d poisson and schrdinger equations , within the negf formalism .",

( [ eqn : noise ] ) holds only if one assumes that fluctuations of the potential profile do not occur , i.e. that coulomb interaction between carriers is completely neglected .",
    "actually , the potential barrier along the channel fluctuates in time , since randomly injected electrons modify the height of the barrier through long - range coulomb interaction , which in turn affects carriers transmission and eventually leads to the suppression of the drain current fluctuations .",
    "in order to compute the expression of the power spectral density in the general case , we take advantage of the second quantization formalism . in particular , at zero magnetic field , the time - dependent current operator at the source can be expressed as the difference between the occupation numbers of carriers moving inward and outward the source contact in each quantum channel  @xcite ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) : @xmath10 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 create and annihilate , respectively , incident electrons in the source lead with total energy @xmath14 in the transverse channel @xmath15 . in the same way , the creation @xmath16 and annihilation @xmath17 operators refer to electrons in the source lead for outgoing states .",
    "for the cnt case , the channel index @xmath15 runs over all the transverse modes and different spin , whereas for snw , it also runs along the six minima of the conduction band in the @xmath18 space .",
    "in addition , the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related through the unitary transformation @xmath21 where the scattering matrix @xmath22 has dimensions @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number of quantum channels in the source and drain contacts , respectively . in the following , time dependence will be neglected , since we are interested to the zero frequency case .    if @xmath26 is a many - particle ( antisymmetrical ) state , the occupation number @xmath27 in the reservoir @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) in the channel @xmath15 can be either 0 or 1 , and can be expressed as @xmath30 . since we are interested to current fluctuations , we need to consider an ensemble of many electrons states @xmath31 and to compute statistical averages @xmath32 . by assuming no correlations between states at different energy or injected from different reservoirs , the statistical average of @xmath33 reads @xmath34 in the following , we identify @xmath35 with @xmath36 . by means of ( [ eqn : relationab ] )",
