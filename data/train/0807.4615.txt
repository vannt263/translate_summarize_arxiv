    "the nature of the x - ray emission of elliptical galaxies has been debated since their discovery as x - ray sources with the _ einstein observatory _ , which led to the early suggestion of ubiquitous hot x - ray emitting halos in hydrostatic equilibrium ( forman et al . 1985 ) .",
    "these halos would originate from the stellar ejecta resulting from their normal evolution , accumulated during the lifetime of the galaxies , and retained by their deep dark matter potentials .",
    "however , from the analysis of these early observations and of rosat and asca data , a more complex picture of the x - ray emission emerged , suggesting that the non - nuclear x - ray emission of these galaxies consist of varying amounts of hot ism , and of a baseline component related to the stellar population , either from the finale stages of stellar evolution ( i.e. low - mass x - ray binaries , lmxbs , trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ; canizares et al . 1987 ; kim , fabbiano & trinchieri 1992 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2006 ; matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ) or possibly from coronal stellar emission ( pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 ) .",
    "although controversial at the time , this picture has important implications for the evolutions of the stars and of the gaseous components of ellipticals , suggesting halo retention in the most massive systems , and partial or full winds in most galaxies ( ciotti et al , 1991 ; david et al .",
    "1991 ; pellegrini & ciotti 1998 )",
    ".    with _ chandra _ for the first time the x - ray emission of nearby ellipticals can be imaged , and the existence of the different emission components can be pursued by direct observational means .",
    "these observations have led to the detection and study of lmxb populations ( see review in fabbiano 2006 ) , and the removal of their contamination from the diffuse emission component ( e.g. ngc  1316 , kim & fabbiano 2003 ) . in some galaxies",
    "this diffuse emission is due to gaseous halos ; however , in other galaxies , where the x - ray luminosity function can be probed to very low luminosities and the residual emission is itself of low luminosity , unresolved lmxbs and possibly stellar emission may account for a large amount or even the bulk of the x - ray luminosity ( e.g.ngc821 , pellegrini et al 2007a , b ; m32 , revnintsev et al .",
    "2007 ) .    we can now attempt to constrain the presence and properties of vestigial hot halos in these gas - poor galaxies . since ellipticals are expected to host super - massive nuclear black holes ( e.g. , richstone et al . 1998 ) , which are however radiatively quiescent in most cases ( fabian & canizares 1988 , pellegrini 2005 , ho 2008 ) , these measurements provide useful constraints for models of halo evolution and nuclear feedback ( e.g. , springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ; see pellegrini et al 2007b ) .",
    "the nearby , gas - poor , early - type galaxy ngc3379 provides an excellent target for these investigations .",
    "this is a very well studied prototypical elliptical , with @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "a series of very deep exposures were obtained for this galaxy by our team ( pi : fabbiano ) , as part of a very large _ chandra _ program aimed at unraveling and studying the different x - ray emission components of ellipticals .",
    "together with pre - existent archival data ( david et al 2005 ) , these observations resulted in an integrated exposure of 337 ks with acis s-3 ( see brassington et al .",
    "2008 for details ) . in this paper",
    "we present our analysis of the diffuse / unresolved x - ray emission component of this galaxy .",
    "this analysis leads us to conclude that in addition to the unresolved emission of faint lmxbs and other stellar sources ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2008 ) , a hot ism is likely to be present in the central 800 pc of ngc3379 .",
    "we discuss our data analysis in section 2 , and our interpretation of these results in section 3 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "we assume a distance of 10.6 mpc ( tonry et al .",
    "2001 ) , which gives a scale of 51 pc/.",
    "we have used the same dataset that brassington et al . ( 2008 ) used to determine the source list and compose the most complete x - ray catalog to - date in ngc 3379 , down to ( 0.3 - 8.0 ) kev luminosities @xmath6 .",
    "all sources in the catalog have been excluded from the present analysis .",
    "we have used an aperture of 2@xmath7 radius . on axis , this aperture encircles @xmath8 97/95% of the point spread function ( psf ) , for energies",
    "0.5/1.5 kev ( see figures 4.6 and 4.20 , and table 4.2 in the chandra proposers observatory guide , and our own simulations with chart , see appendix ) , and it degrades very slowly to encircle @xmath9% at @xmath10 for the same energies ( fig . 4.13 in the the chandra proposers observatory guide ) . as will become apparent in what follows , this work will concentrate on the central area ngc  3379 , of @xmath11 radius ; therefore , our data are not affected by the degradation of the _ chandra _ point response function , and we do not need to consider a larger area for source exclusion .",
    "we discuss the possible contamination of the psf in the appendix .",
    "the size of the area considered also ensures a very homogeneous coverage from all five observations , since the region under study resides well within the area uniformly covered in all the _ chandra _ exposures ( roughly a @xmath12 rectangle , see fig . 1 in brassington et al .",
    "therefore we do not need to resort to modelling of the exposure , and we can use a local estimate of the background from the same merged dataset .",
    "this procedure minimizes the uncertainties introduced by using a template or  blank sky observations \" of different portions of the sky at different times , to estimate the field background .",
    "we have used two different merged datasets for our analysis .",
    "all five observations were used for the spatial analysis but only the four most recent observations were merged for the spectral analysis , given the significantly different response of the acis s3 ccd in the first observation obtained in 2001 ( ao2 ) . since this observation has the shortest exposure , not using it will not significantly degrade the statistics , while reducing the systematic error from the calibration uncertainties .",
    "the responses of the last four observations over the area of interest are virtually identical      fig .",
    "[ raw ] shows azimuthally averaged radial profiles of the diffuse x - ray emission in the ( 0.3 - 2.0 kev ) and ( 2.0 - 5.0 )  kev energy bands .",
    "the choice of the spectral ranges is motivated by our intention to discriminate between a harder band ( 2.0 - 5.0 )  kev , where all the emission , resolved and unresolved , is likely to arise from stellar sources , and a softer band ( 0.3 - 2.0 )  kev , to which a hot ism may contribute .",
    "we have excluded all detected sources ( as explained above ) , and centered the concentric annuli on the nucleus , identified as the optical / ir center and coinciding with source # 81 in brassington et al .",
    "note that as a consequence of this , and also due to source crowding at the center , the x - ray profiles can not probe the very central region within r=23 .",
    "the raw profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ raw ] flatten at a radius of @xmath13 , indicating that the field background dominates .",
    "we can therefore use the 100@xmath14 region to estimate the local background and subtract it from the emission , to produce the net profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ raw]-right in the same energy bands .",
    "note that the soft profile is more extended and more centrally peaked relative to the hard profile .",
    "in fig  [ softprof ] we divide the full energy range considered in three , and show the azimuthally averaged net profiles in the ( 0.3 - 0.7 ) kev , ( 0.7 - 1.5 ) kev and ( 1.5 - 5.0 ) kev bands .",
    "this choice of energy boundaries was motivated by the results of the spectral analysis of the diffuse emission ( see next section , fig  [ unfold ] ) , to maximize the contribution of the two optically thin thermal plasma component identified in the x - ray spectrum , with temperatures of @xmath15 kev and at @xmath16 kev , respectively .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ softprof ] that while both the very soft and the harder component follow a similar radial distribution , the soft ( 0.7 - 1.5 kev ) component has a distinct excess for galactocentric radii r@xmath17 .    in the same fig .",
    "[ softprof ] we plot the radial profiles in the optical and in the near ir k - band , from the hst f814 filter image and the 2mass k - band image , obtained from their respective archives ( see also cappellari et al .",
    "these profiles are also azimuthally averaged , but do not cover the full 360  azimuthal plane of the galaxy , except for the very center ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 radius for hst and 2mass respectively ) since the two images only partially cover the galaxy .",
    "we also add the sauron i - band data profile from cappellari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that cover instead the full extent of the galaxy .",
    "the profiles are normalized to the x - ray data by rescaling them for radii r@xmath20 .    with the exception of the very central region ( @xmath21 radius ) ,",
    "the optical - ir profiles follow one another , and trace well the distribution of the very soft and hard x - ray profiles . on the contrary , the ( 0.7 - 1.5 ) kev profile is more centrally peaked and only becomes consistent with the shape of the optical - ir ones at r@xmath22 .      we have analyzed the spectral data extracted in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 regions from the merged dataset from the four more recent observations .",
    "most of the results discussed here come from the @xmath24 region , which is a reasonable compromise that includes a large fraction of the diffuse emission at high significance , but all regions studied give a consistent picture . to increase the statistical significance of each spectral bin",
    ", we have binned the data to obtain a minimum significance of 2@xmath26 or better in the net data .",

    "we find that a single apec component , with kt@xmath300.3 kev , and a 7 kev bremsstrahlung model are able to approximate the data and give an acceptable value for the reduced @xmath31 1 .",
    "however , inspection of the residuals shows a noticeable excess at around 1 kev ( with a peak at about 5 @xmath26 ) and a less significant deficit at 0.6 - 0.8 kev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] .",
    "the addition of a second apec component reduces the @xmath32 value and most of all eliminates the excess , suggesting two separate components at 0.3 kev and 1.0 kev ( fig .",

    "[ unfold ] shows the best - fit unfolded spectral components , from which it becomes evident that the @xmath16 kev component is clearly dominant over the @xmath33 kev component in the 0.7 - 1.5 kev band .",
    "we tested whether the existing data support a requirement of a second soft plasma component in the spectrum , by computing the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) , discussed by schwarz ( 1978 ; an astronomical introduction to it can be found in liddle 2004 , and an application in tajer et al .",
    "2007 ) for both models .",
    "this quantity approximates the bayes factor ( jeffreys 1961 ; kass & raftery 1995 ) , which gives the posterior odds of one model against another , presuming that the models are equally favored prior to the data fitting ( liddle 2004 ) .",
    "the difference @xmath34bic can be used to evaluate the relative value of the two models .",
    "we find @xmath34bic of 5 - 6 ( depending on the region used ) , which can be used as a strong evidence ( see jeffreys 1961 ; liddle 2004 ) that we are justified in introducing the 1 kev component in the spectral modelling .",
    "we have investigated further the spatial distribution of the different spectral components by comparing the spectra from the @xmath23 and @xmath35 regions , both fitted with a single apec spectrum at 0.3 kev ( fig .",
    "[ spec2 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that there is no residual emission at 1 kev in the spectrum from the outer region ; this suggests that the additional  soft \" component is more concentrated towards the center , consistent with the radial profile comparison of fig .",
    "[ softprof ] .    from the spectral results we can estimate the luminosity of each individual component , summarized in table 1 .",
    "the measured unabsorbed luminosity of the total unresolved emission , within the 30@xmath7 region , is @xmath36  in the 0.3 - 10 kev range , equally divided below and above 2 kev .",
    "the hard band luminosity is totally accounted for by the bremsstrahlung component , which alone gives a luminosity l@xmath37  in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "the 1 kev component contributes for @xmath38  in this band , and the residual @xmath39  is due to the 0.3 kev emission .",
    "errors are estimated from the best fit values ( 68% confidence values , from xspec ) .",
    "we have estimated a correction factor to recover the area lost due to masking the point sources ( see table 1 ) , and a second one to account for the fraction of emission not included in the area used in the spectral analysis ( given in table 2 ) . these can be used to estimate the total luminosity of the very soft and hard components , which we list in table 2 .",
    "the component at 1 kev appears to contribute only in the central region , for r @xmath40 .",
    "we have analyzed the spectral and spatial distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission in ngc 3379 with deep _",
    "data , cleaned of all detected sources down to a threshold luminosity l@xmath41 ( see brassington et al .",

    "2006 ) .",
    "the spectral distribution of this unresolved emission in the 30region used for the spectral analysis suggests the presence of 3 distinct components . the dominant contribution in the broad 0.3 - 10 kev band",
    "can be modeled with a bremsstrahlung emission at @xmath45 kev and is likely to arise from lower luminosity lmxbs and other stellar components that can not be detected individually in the present data , as also suggested by its spatial distribution , which follows that of the optical and ir stellar light ( fig .",
    "[ softprof ] ) .",
    "this component accounts for all of the emission above 2 kev and about 1/2 of the emission below 2 kev , and has an estimated total @xmath46  ( 0.5 - 10 kev , see table 2 ) .",
    "we also find two additional optically thin thermal components , with best fit temperatures of @xmath33  kev and @xmath16  kev , contributing roughly 2/3 and 1/3 of the 0.5 - 2.0 kev residual luminosity , respectively ( see table 1 ) , in the 30  radius region .",
    "this result is supported by the combined evidence of excess emission at @xmath16 kev over the dominant 0.3 kev plasma in the spectral data ( fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] ) , and of a different spatial distribution of the two components , when the data below and above 0.7 kev are selected ( fig .",
    "[ softprof ] ) .",
    "on average , the 0.3 kev component has a spatial distribution consistent with that of the lower luminosity lmxbs and coronally active stars ( traced by the emission above 1.5 kev ) and of the stars ( traced by the i - band and k - band emission ) , while the 1  kev emission is more centrally peaked , and is prominent out to @xmath47 .",
    "two previous detailed studies of the diffuse emission of ngc  3379 based on _ chandra _ data can be found in the literature . based on the first 2001 short observation david et al .",
    "( 2005 ) conclude that the diffuse emission is dominated by undetected faint point sources , but with a 10% contribution from a gaseous component , with kt@xmath48 kev , in the central 770 pc .",
    "this hot ism would have a luminosity of @xmath49 ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) and a mass of @xmath50 m@xmath51 .",
    "our estimate of the luminosity of the optically thin thermal diffuse emission in the same region is consistent with that of david et al ( 2005 ) , but we are able to distinguish two separate components of this emission .",
    "ngc 3379 is also included in the sample examined by fukazawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who also report a detection of a component at 0.5 kev in a small region of the galaxy .",
    "more recently , revnivtsev et al . (",
    "2008 ) have suggested a different interpretation for the unresolved emission : using the full dataset as in the present work , they derive a radial profile of the 0.5 - 2.0 kev emission , cleaned of detected sources , which they compare with the k - band profile . based on this comparison they conclude that all of the unresolved emission observed in ngc 3379 can be attributed to the emission of stellar sources , with no evidence of a truly diffuse ism . our net radial profile of fig .",
    "[ raw ] is entirely consistent with that of revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , giving us confidence that slight differences in the data analysis , in the subtraction of detected sources obtained with different algorithms or in the choice of the background level , are not significant sources of discrepancies .",
    "the main difference between this work and revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2008 ) therefore lies in our spectral and spatial analysis , that enables us to distinguish two separate spectral components of the soft diffuse emission , with different spatial properties , which contribute equal amounts to the total in the inner @xmath52 radius .",
    "our analysis suggests the presence of three components of the diffuse emission of ngc 3379 . as summarized above , the hard and very soft emission are spatially consistent with a stellar origin ; a detailed discussion of this integrated x - ray emission from stellar sources ( lmxbs , cataclysmic variables , active stars and stellar coronae ) is given by revnivtsev et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "this stellar emission has been invoked to explain the diffuse x - ray emission of the galactic ridge ( revnivtsev et al 2006 , sazonov et al .",
    "2006 ) , the bulge of m31 ( bogdn & gilfanov 2008 ) , m32 ( revnivtsev et al . 2007 ) and ngc821 ( pellegrini et al 2007a ) .    in what follows",
    "we will concentrate on the emission of the ( 0.7 - 1.5 )  kev band .",
    "this component has a different spatial distribution , more concentrated in the center and more centrally peaked than the stellar emission ( see fig .",
    "[ softprof ] ) , indicating a different origin .",
    "we suggest that this component is likely to originate from a @xmath301  kev hot plasma , and discuss it in the context of an appropriate model for a galactic flow .      the interpretation of the 0.7 - 1.5 kev emission detected in ngc 3379 as due to a different component than the softer and harder ones opens the possibility that this is the long sought for evidence of a hot ism in this galaxy ( e.g. , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 , david et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , as shown by fig .  [ unfold ] , all three components contribute to the 0.7 - 1.5 kev emission , while both the softer , and in particular the harder , energy ranges are less contaminated by the other components .",
    "the spectral results can be reliably used to estimate the contribution of each component to the total luminosity . to estimate the spatial distribution of each separately , we have to resort to a few reasonable assumptions , which we have already discussed and that we summarize below : a ) the profiles in both the very soft and hard energy bands are very similar in shape , therefore we can treat them as having a common origin with different rescaling factors ; b ) they are also consistent with the i - band and k- band profiles , again with possibly different rescaling along the full spatial extent probed ; and c ) the 0.7 - 1.5 kev profile is also consistent in shape with all above profiles for r@xmath22 , where there is no longer any evidence of the emission due to the 1 kev component ( fig .  [ spec2 ] ) .",
    "we can therefore reasonably conclude that the 0.7 - 1.5 kev emission at r@xmath22 traces the soft and hard components , and that an extrapolation at smaller radii could be used to give a reasonable estimate of the local contribution from the stellar component at different radii .",
    "we have used the k - band data normalized to the 0.7 - 1.5 kev emission at r@xmath22 as the best proxy to extrapolate the profile at smaller radii , since we can use it as a model with virtually no errors . while this relies on the assumption that the stellar light is a good tracer of the x - ray binary population , with no local , though small , variations , the observed agreement with the x - ray profiles of the residual emission at softer and harder bands ( fig .",
    "[ softprof ] ) supports this assumption .",
    "we therefore derive the radial distribution of the @xmath16 kev component as the excess over our model ( fig .",
    "[ gas ] ) which we can now compare to the expected emission from a hot ism , derived from the hydrodynamical simulations described below .",
    "note that the x - ray luminosity derived from integrating the radial distribution of fig .",
    "[ gas ] is l@xmath53 erg s@xmath54 , consistent with that derived from the spectral analysis .    from the spectral results and the assumption of spherical symmetry",
    ", we can estimate the average density and total mass of gas responsible for the emission measured .",
    "we derive a very low density of @xmath55 @xmath56 and a total mass of gas m@xmath57 m@xmath3 , in a region of @xmath58 pc in radius at the center .",
    "the round optical shape ( morphological type e1 ) , its optical colors , typical of an old population ( terlevich & forbes 2002 ) , and the lack of signs of current or past interactions ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) allow us to assume that a simple  passively evolving \" stellar population feeds a hot gas flow , whose evolution can be reasonably studied with spherically symmetric hydrodynamical simulations . the numerical code used to solve the time - dependent equations of hydrodynamics with source terms is described in details in ciotti et al .",
    "we adopt a central grid spacing of 20 pc , which provides a good match to the scale of the observations in the inner regions ; the simulations do not cover feedback effects and the flow evolution close to the central massive black hole ( shapiro et al .",
    "2006 ) .    given the high quality data available for this galaxy , it is possible to build a mass model tailored specifically onto ngc  3379 , and consider the best recipes available for the mass and energy source terms .",
    "these are briefly described below .",
    "the optical profile is well described by a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) law over a span of  10 magnitudes ( capaccioli et al .",
    "1990 ; peletier et al .",
    "1990 ) , therefore the simulations use the stellar mass density profile given by the hernquist ( 1990 ) distribution , that is a very good approximation of the de vaucouleurs law and has the advantage that its dynamical properties can be expressed analytically .",

    "the values of the cooling function @xmath87 , as a function of temperature , have been obtained with the apec code in xspec , for solar abundance , consistent with the estimate for the stellar population ( terlevich & forbes 2002 ) ; a  best fit \" @xmath88 was then derived from these values and used in the @xmath89 and @xmath86 calculation ( that takes into account the whole density and temperature distributions over the computational grid ) .",
    "after @xmath90 gyr , the gas has a 0.32 kev luminosity of @xmath91 erg s@xmath54 , in good agreement with the observed one .",
    "this is a reasonable time scale that corresponds to the estimated age of ngc 3379 : terlevich & forbes ( 2002 ) give an age of @xmath92 gyr ; more recently , a mean age in the range 815 gyr has been confirmed by gregg et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and denicol et al .",
    "the central temperature is @xmath93 k out to a few hundred pc , and is steeply declining outwards ; the central gas density is @xmath94 @xmath56 and is also steeply declining outwards .",
    "the mass of the hot gas is @xmath95 within a radius of 800 pc ( in good agreement with that obtained in sect .",
    "the emission weighted gas temperature within a radius of @xmath96 is @xmath97 kev , a value near the lower range of those allowed for by observations ( see fig .  [ contour ] ) .",

    "( 1999 ) , and a slope for the snia s decay rate of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "both model profiles reproduce well the observed  gas profile \" derived above .",
    "we note that a larger age for the gas flow would result in a lower stellar mass loss rate and lower gas content , with consequently lower ism emission , below the observed one .",
    "with the very deep _ chandra _ observation of ngc 3379 we have scored two firsts : we have the first evidence of a very small amount of hot ism in a nearby galaxy , down to the level of @xmath101 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) , and at the same time we have the first evidence that this gas is in an outflow phase , which has been predicted by models but as of yet has not been observed . as a third and equally important result",
    ", we find that detailed modelling based on the optical data ( stellar mass , total mass and supernova rate ) reproduces remarkably well the observed total luminosity , total mass and spatial distribution of the hot phase of the gas .",
    "after detection and removal of point sources down to a luminosity of @xmath6  we have been able to study the unresolved emission in ngc 3379 . the detailed spectral analysis has led us to the evidence of three separate components : a very soft ( plasma at kt@xmath300.3 kev ) and a hard ( bremsstrahlung at kt=7 kev ) components can be attributed to the integrated emission of unresolved sources , closely linked to the stellar population ( binary systems and coronally active stars , as discussed by revnivtsev et al .",
    "however we also detect a hot ism in this galaxy , within the innermost @xmath30 800 pc , with a luminosity @xmath0  ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "this is lowest detection of a hot gas in a nearby early - type galaxy .",
    "the total gas mass involved is also very small , of a few @xmath102 m@xmath3 .    with the aid of hydrodynamical simulations and a galaxy model tailored specifically on ngc3379",
    ", we have reproduced both the luminosity and the average radial distribution of this hot gas component . for a snia s explosion rate consistent with current estimates ,",
    "the gas is outflowing , even for the `` maximum '' dark matter model , where the amount of dark mass is the maximum allowed for by optical studies .",
    ".    at the suggestion of the referee",
    ", we have thoroughly checked that the results obtained above , in particular the detection of the @xmath16 kev component , are not due to a faulty subtraction of the detected sources .",
    "we have run several tests , which we illustrate below .",
    "\\1 ) we have first redone the spatial and spectral analysis assuming a circle of @xmath103 and @xmath104 radius for point source exclusion , with analogous results , albeith somewhat larger errors , due to the smaller statistics available .",
    "\\2 ) we have also simulated the _ chandra _ s psf using chart ( carter et al .",
    "since we were interested in the wings of the psf , we have run several simulations for 20,000 counts each and then merged the resulting images to increase the statistics at radii larger than @xmath105 we have used the average spectrum obtained in the inner 15@xmath7 , inclusive of all detected sources , as an input parameter in all simulations .",
    "we have then treated the results as we have the data of ngc 3379 , namely we have produced radial profiles in the same energy bands and calculated the expected contribution from point sources in the regions of interest .",
    "we expect that 4% of the counts detected from a point sources within 2@xmath7 from its peak falls in the @xmath24 region , and 3.6% in the @xmath23 region , in the 0.3 - 2.0 kev band ( with values between 3% and 5% in the softer and harder of the bands considered ) . if we integrate the contribution due to the `` wings '' of all point sources detected in a radius=30 , we can only account for 10 - 25% of the detected counts in the 0.3 - 0.7 , and 0.7 - 1.5 kev bands in the unresolved component .",
    "this is a generous estimate of the contribution from the discrete population , since only sources at the center of the region will contribute the full amount , the wings of the others being only partially included in the region considered .",
    "\\3 ) we have used the current documents online and directly contacted the experts on both the psf and its wings ( dr . t gaetz and d. jerius ) to better understand the effects of the wings of the point spread function .",
    "the most updated studies on the psf wings are based on the ground xrcf and on - orbit her x-1 data .",
    "both data sets demonstrate the existence of the psf wings , but the effects of this component decrease rapidly with decreasing energy .",
    "the ray trace model used to simulate the psf ( point 2 above ) includes some of the effects of wings , and appears to be reliable at low energies ( @xmath106 2 kev ) and small radii , although it might be underestimating the wing effects at energies above 2.0 - 2.5 kev .",
    "however , we are mostly interested in the emission below @xmath30 1.5 kev and relatively small radii , where the model appears to be adequate .",
    "\\4 ) we have re - analyzed the spectrum of the emission in the @xmath23 regions excluding only the 5 brightest sources with a significantly smaller exclusion region of @xmath105 radius .",
    "this exclusion is necessary to avoid that the point source population completely dominates the spectral results ; on the other hand , if the sources were responsible for the 1 kev component , it should be significantly stronger when sources are included in the spectral analysis .",
    "the spectral results indicate that , while the net counts increase by a factor of 4 , the 1 kev component only increases by a factor of 1.5 the original value , consistent with the ratio of the areas of the regions considered .",
    "all in all , we believe that the excess emission observed in the 0.7 - 1.5 kev band is a real effect , and is not an artifact related to the wings of the many individual sources detected in the area",
    ". this excess is relative to the emission in adjacent energy bands , and is seen at energies where the effects of psf wings are significantly smaller than at higher energies .",
    "we also believe that there is excess emission over the scattering from the detected point sources , although we are fully aware of the fact that the exact evaluation of its strength has large uncertainties , both in the soft and in particular in the hard band .",
    "we thank stefano andreon for many interesting discussion on the statistical aspects of the data analysis , and terry gaetz and diab jerius for their help in understanding the psf issues .",
    "we thank the referee for raising the issue of the effects of the psf , that prompted us to better investigate the reliability of the results .",
