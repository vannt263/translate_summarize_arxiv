    "linear response theory ( lrt ) @xcite is the leading formalism to deal with driven systems .",
    "such systems are described by a hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a set of time dependent classical parameters ( `` fields '' ) .",
    "the kubo formula is the corner stone of lrt .",
    "it allows the calculation of the response coefficients , and in particular the _ conductance matrix _ ( @xmath4 ) of the system . if we know @xmath4",
    ", we can calculate the charge ( @xmath0 ) which is transported through the system during one cycle of a periodic driving .",
    "this is called _",
    "pumping_.    pumping of charge in mesoscopic @xcite and molecular size devices is regarded as a major issue in the realization of future quantum circuits or quantum gates , possibly for the purpose of quantum computing .      in order to explain the motivation for the present work , and its relation to the published literature",
    ", we have to give a better definition of the problem . for presentation purpose",
    "we focus on a model system with a ring geometry ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the shape of the ring is controlled by some parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these parameters can be gate voltages that determine the location of some boundaries , or the height of some barriers .",
    "the third parameter is the flux through the ring : @xmath7 we shall use units such that the elementary charge is .",
    "note that the hamiltonian @xmath8 has gauge invariance for @xmath9 .",
    "another system with a ring topology is presents in fig .  1b , and its abstraction",
    "is represented in fig .  2c .",
    "the  dot \" can be represented by an @xmath1 matrix that depends on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "1d also the flux @xmath10 is regarded as a parameter of the dot .",
    "if we cut the wire in fig.1d we get the open two lead geometry of fig.1e .",
    "finally we can put many such units in series ( no flux ) , hence getting the periodic system of fig.1f . in the latter case",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant for unit translations , and therefore the quasi momentum @xmath11 is a constant of motion .",
    "it follows that the mathematical treatment of a driven periodic structure reduces to an analysis of a driven ring system with flux .",
    "_  pumping \" _ means that net charge ( or maybe better to say  net integrated probability current \" ) is transported through the ring per cycle of a periodic driving . using the common jargon of electrical engineering this can be described as ac - dc conversion .",
    "we distinguish between +    * pumping in open systems ( such as in fig .",
    "* pumping in closed systems ( such as in fig .",
    "1d ) * pumping in periodic systems ( such as in fig .",
    "1f )    for a reason that was explained at the end of the previous subsection we regard the last category @xcite as mathematically equivalent to the second category .",
    "we also regard the first category @xcite as a special ( subtle ) limit of the second category : in a follow up paper @xcite we demonstrate that in the limit of open geometry the kubo formula reduces to the @xmath1-matrix formula of bttiker prtre and thomas @xcite .",
    "there are works in the literature regarding  rectification \" and  ratchets \" @xcite .",
    "these can be regarded as studies of pumping in periodic systems with the connotation of having _ damped _ non - hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "these type of systems are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "there is also a recent interest in hamiltonian ratchets@xcite , which is again a synonym for pumping in periodic systems , but with the connotation of having a _ non - linear _ pumping mechanism .",
    "we are going to clarify what are the conditions for having a _ linear _ pumping mechanism . only in case of linear pumping mechanism",
    "the kubo formula can be used , which should be distinguished from the non - linear mechanism of ref.@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explain and demonstrate that the kubo formula contains all the physically relevant ingredients for the calculation of the charge ( @xmath0 ) which is pumped during one cycle of a periodic driving . in the limit of a very slow time variation ( small @xmath12 ) , the emerging picture coincides with the adiabatic picture of refs.@xcite . in this limit",
    "the response of the system is commonly described as a non - dissipative  geometric magnetism \" @xcite effect , or as adiabatic transport .",
    "a major objective of this paper is to bridge between the adiabatic picture and the more general lrt / kubo picture , and to explain how _ dissipation _ emerges in the quantum mechanical treatment . for one - parameter driving a unifying picture that bridges between the quantum mechanical adiabatic picture and lrt has been presented in @xcite .",
    "a previous attempt @xcite had ended in some confusion regarding the identification of the linear response regime , while @xcite had avoided the analysis of the mechanism that leads to dissipation in the quantum mechanical case .",
    "the presented ( kubo based ) formulation of the pumping problem has few advantages : it is not restricted to the adiabatic regime ; it allows a clear distinction between _ dissipative _ and _ adiabatic _ contributions to the pumping ; the classical limit is manifest in the formulation ; it gives a level by level understanding of the pumping process ; it allows the consideration of any type of occupation ( not necessarily fermi occupation ) ; it allows future incorporation of external environmental influences such as that of noise ; it regards the voltage over the pump as electro motive force , rather than adopting the conceptually more complicated view @xcite of having a chemical potential difference .    of particular interest is the possibility to realize a pumping cycle that transfers _ exactly _ one unit of charge per cycle . in open systems",
    "@xcite this ",
    "quantization \" holds only approximately , and it has been argued @xcite that the deviation from exact quantization is due to the dissipative effect . furthermore it has been claimed @xcite that exact quantization would hold in the strict adiabatic limit , if the system were _",
    "closed_. in this paper we would like to show that the correct picture is quite different . we shall demonstrate that the deviation from exact quantization is in fact of adiabatic nature .",
    "this deviation is related to the so - called  thouless conductance \" of the device .",
    "we give several examples for the application of the kubo formula to the calculation of the pumped charge  @xmath0 : +    * classical dissipative pumping * classical adiabatic pumping ( by translation ) * quantum pumping in the double barrier model    the last example is the main one . in the context of open geometry",
    "it is known as ",
    "pumping around a resonance \" @xcite .",
    "we explain that this is in fact an diabatic transfer scheme , and we analyze a particular version of this model which is represented by a 3  site lattice hamiltonian .",
    "this is definitely the simplest pump circuit possible , and we believe that it can be realized as a molecular size device . it also can be regarded as an approximation for the closed geometry version of the two delta potential pump @xcite .      in section  2 we define the main object of the study , which is the conductance matrix @xmath4 of eq.([e_8 ] ) .",
    "the conductance matrix can be written as the sum of a symmetric ( @xmath13 ) and an anti - symmetric ( @xmath14 ) matrices , which are later identified as the dissipative and the adiabatic contributions respectively .    in the first part of the paper ( sections  2 - 8 ) we analyze the adiabatic equation ( section  3 ) , and illuminate the distinction between its zero order solution ( section  4 ) , its stationary first order solution ( section  5 ) , and its non - stationary solution ( section  6 ) .",
    "the outcome of the analysis in section  5 is eq.([e_30 ] ) for the conductance matrix @xmath4 .",
    "this expression is purely adiabatic , and does not give any dissipation . in order to get dissipation we have to look for a non - stationary solution .",
    "the standard textbook derivation of the kubo formula ( eq.([e_33 ] ) ) for the conductance matrix @xmath4 _ implicitly _ assumes a non - stationary solution .",
    "we show how to get from it eq.([e_34 ] ) for @xmath13 and eq.([e_35 ] ) for @xmath14 .",
    "the latter is shown to be identical with the adiabatic result ( eq.([e_30 ] ) ) . in section  7",
    "we further simplify the expression for @xmath13 leading to the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( eq.([e43 ] ) ) .",
    "the disadvantages of the standard textbook derivation of kubo formula make it is essential to introduce a different route toward eq.([e43 ] ) for @xmath13 .",
    "this route , which is discusssed in section  8 , _ explicitly _ distinguishes the dissipative effect from the adiabatic effect , and allows to determine the conditions for the validity of either the adiabatic picture or lrt .",
    "in particular it is explained that lrt is based , as strange as it sounds , on perturbation theory to infinite order .",
    "in section  9 we clarify the general scheme of the pumping calculation ( eq.([e6 ] ) ) .",
    "section  10 and section  11 give two simple classical examples . in section  12",
    "we turn to discuss quantum pumping , where the cycle is around a chain of degeneracies .",
    "the general discussion is followed by presentation of the double barrier model ( section  13 ) . in order to get a quantitative estimate for the pumped charge we consider a 3  site lattice hamiltonian ( section  14 ) .",
    "the summary ( section  15 ) gives some larger perspective on the subject , pointing out the relation to the @xmath1-matrix formalism , and to the born - oppenheimer picture . in the appendices we give some more details regarding the derivations , so as to have a self - contained presentation .",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath15 , where @xmath3 is a set of time dependent parameters ( `` fields '' ) . for presentation , as well as for practical reasons , we assume later a set of three time dependent parameters .",
    "we define generalized forces in the conventional way as @xmath16 note that if @xmath5 is the location of a wall element , then @xmath17 is the force in the newtonian sense . if @xmath6 is an electric field , then @xmath18 is the polarization . if @xmath10 is the magnetic field or the flux through a ring , then @xmath19 is the magnetization or the current through the ring .    in linear response theory ( lrt )",
    "the response of the system is described by a causal response kernel , namely @xmath20 where @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath23 is the generalized susceptibility @xmath24 .",
    "the conductance matrix is defined as : @xmath25}{\\omega } \\ = \\",
    "\\int_0^{\\infty } \\alpha^{kj}(\\tau ) \\tau d\\tau\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , as explained further in appendix  b , the response in the  dc limit \" ( @xmath26 ) can be written as @xmath27 as an example for the applicability of this formula note the following standard examples for one parameter driving : let @xmath28 wall or piston displacement , then @xmath29 wall or piston velocity , @xmath30 friction coefficient , and @xmath31 is the friction force .",
    "another standard example is @xmath28 magnetic flux , @xmath32 electro motive force , @xmath30 electrical conductance , and hence @xmath31 is ohm law .",
    "it is convenient to write the conductance matrix as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the symmetric part of the conductance matrix , while @xmath35 is the antisymmetric part . in case of having three parameters we can arrange the elements of the antisymmetric part as a vector .",
    "consequently eq.([e_8 ] ) can be written in abstract notation as @xmath36 where the dot product should be interpreted as matrix - vector multiplication , which involves summation over the index  @xmath37 .",
    "the wedge - product also can be regarded as a matrix - vector multiplication .",
    "it reduces to the more familiar cross - product in case that we consider @xmath38 parameters .",
    "the dissipation , which is defined as the rate in which energy is absorbed into the system , is given by @xmath39 only the symmetric part contributes to the the dissipation .",
    "the contribution of the antisymmetric part is identically zero .",
    "the adiabatic equation is conventionally obtained from the schrodinger equation by expanding the wavefunction in the @xmath40-dependent adiabatic basis : @xmath41 where following @xcite we define @xmath42 differentiation by parts of @xmath43 leads to the conclusion that @xmath44 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "note that the effect of gauge transformation is @xmath45 note that the diagonal elements @xmath46 are real , and transform as @xmath47 .    associated with @xmath48 is the gauge invariant 2-form , which is defined as : @xmath49 this can be written in an abstract notation as @xmath50 . using standard manipulations , namely via differentiation by parts of @xmath51",
    ", we get for @xmath52 the expressions : @xmath53 and hence @xmath54 } { ( e_m - e_n)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we define the perturbation matrix as @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 . then the adiabatic equation can be re - written as follows : @xmath58 if we neglect the perturbation @xmath59 , then we get the strict adiabatic solution : @xmath60 due to @xmath48 , we have the so called geometric phase . this can be gauged away unless we consider a closed cycle . for a closed cycle , the gauge invariant phase @xmath61 is called berry phase .    with the above zero - order solution we can obtain the following result : @xmath62 in case of the standard examples that were mentioned previously this corresponds to conservative force or to persistent current . from now on we ignore this trivial contribution to @xmath63 , and look for the a first order contribution .",
    "for linear driving ( unlike the case of a cycle ) the @xmath48 field can be gauged away .",
    "assuming further that the adiabatic equation can be treated as parameter independent ( that means disregarding the parametric dependence of @xmath64 and @xmath65 on @xmath66 ) one realizes that eq.([e_24 ] ) possesses stationary solutions . to first order these are : @xmath67 note that in a _ fixed - basis representation _",
    "the above stationary solution is in fact time - dependent .",
    "hence the notations @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are possibly more appropriate .    with the above solution we can write @xmath63 as a sum of zero order and first order contributions .",
    "from now on we ignore the zero order contribution , and go on with the first order contribution : @xmath71 for a general _ stationary _ preparation , either pure or mixed , one obtains eq.([e_8 ] ) with @xmath72 where @xmath73 are weighting factors , with the normalization @xmath74 . for a pure state preparation @xmath73 distinguishes only one state @xmath75 , while for canonical preparation @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the temperature . for a many - body system of non - interacting fermions",
    "@xmath73 can be re - interpreted as the fermi occupation function , so that @xmath78 is the total number of particles .",
    "thus we see that the assumption of a stationary first - order solution leads to a non - dissipative ( antisymmetric ) conductance matrix this is know as either adiabatic transport @xcite or  geometric magnetism \" @xcite . in the later sections we shall discuss the limitations of the above result .",
    "the kubo formula is an expression for the linear response of a driven system that goes beyond the stationary adiabatic solution of the previous section .",
    "the kubo formula has many type of derivations .",
    "one possibility is to use the same procedure as in section  5 starting with @xmath79 { \\mbox{e}^}{-ie_mt } |m\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for completeness we also give in appendix  a a simple version of the standard derivation , which is based on a conventional fixed - basis first - order - treatment of the perturbation .",

    "the kubo formula for the symmetric part of the conductance matrix ( @xmath92 ) can be further simplified .",
    "if we take eq.([e_34 ] ) literally , then @xmath93 due to the simple fact that we have finite spacing between energy levels ( see @xcite for a statistical point of view ) .",
    "but if we assume that the energy levels have some finite width @xmath94 , then the smoothed version of @xmath84 should be considered . in common textbooks",
    "the introduction of @xmath94 is  justified \" by assuming some weak coupling to an environment , or by taking the limit of infinite volume .",
    "but we are dealing with a strictly isolated finite system , and therefore the meaning of @xmath94 requires serious consideration .",
    "we postpone the discussion of this issue to the next section .    if the smoothed version of @xmath84 should be used in eq.([e_34 ] ) , then it is possible to obtain @xmath92 from power spectrum @xmath95 of the fluctuations .",
    "this is called the fluctuation - dissipation relation . the spectral function @xmath95 is defined as the fourier transform of the symmetrized correlation function @xmath96 we use again the interaction picture , as in the definition of @xmath83 .",
    "also this function has a well defined classical limit .",

    "it can be obtained by canonical averaging over the microcanonical version leading to : @xmath100",
    "the standard derivation of the dissipative part of the kubo formula , leading to the fluctuation - dissipation relation eq.([e43 ] ) , is not very illuminating physically .",
    "more troubling is the realization that one can not tell from the standard derivation what are the conditions for its validity .",
    "an alternate , physically appealing derivation @xcite , is based on the observation that energy absorption is related to having diffusion in energy space @xcite . in appendix",
    "e we outline the main ingredients of this approach",
    ".    it should be clear that the diffusion picture of appendix  e holds only in case of _",
    "chaotic systems_. if this diffusion picture does not hold , then also the kubo formula for @xmath92 does not hold ! driven one - dimensional systems are the obvious example for the failure of linear response theory ( lrt ) . as in the case of the kicked rotator ( standard map ) @xcite there is a complicated route to chaos and stochasticity : by increasing the driving amplitude the phase space structure is changed .",
    "if the amplitude is smaller than a threshold value , then the diffusion is blocked by kolmogorov - arnold - moser curves , and consequently there is not dissipation .",
    "therefore the kubo formula is not applicable in such cases .",
    "the following discussion of _ dissipative response _ assumes that we deal with a quantized chaotic system .",
    "we would like to discuss the reason and the consequences of having an energy scale @xmath94 . in the standard derivation the assumption of having level broadening as if comes out of the blue . as we already noted",
    "it is customary in textbooks to argue that either a continuum limit , or some small coupling to an environment is essential in order to provide @xmath94 . but",
    "this is of course just a way to avoid confrontation with the physical problem of having a driven _ isolated finite mesoscopic system_. in fact the energy scale @xmath94 is related to the rate ( @xmath12 ) of the driving : @xmath101 where for simplicity of presentation we assume one parameter driving .",
    "we use @xmath102 to denote the mean level spacing , and @xmath103 is the root mean square value of the matrix element @xmath104 between neighboring levels . in order to derive the above expression for @xmath94 we have used the result of @xcite ( sec.17 ) for the  core width `` at the breaktime @xmath105 of perturbation theory .",
    "the purpose of the present section is to give an optional ' ' pedestrian derivation \" for @xmath94 , and to discuss the physical consequences .",
    "looking at the first order solution eq.([e_28 ] ) of section  5 one realizes that it makes sense provided @xmath106 .",
    "this leads to the adiabaticity condition @xmath107 .",
    "the adiabaticity condition eq.([e91 ] ) can be explained in a more illuminating way as follows : let us assume that we prepare the system at time @xmath108 at the level @xmath109 . using _ time dependent _ fopt we find out that a stationary - like solution is reached after the heisenberg time @xmath110 .",
    "this is of course a valid description provided we do not have by then a breakdown of fopt .",
    "the condition for this is easily found to be @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "this leads again to the adiabaticity condition eq.([e91 ] ) .",
    "another assumption in the derivation of section  5 was that we can ignore the parametric dependence of @xmath64 and @xmath65 on @xmath66 .",
    "the adiabaticity condition @xmath113 manifestly justify such an assumption : we should think of @xmath114 as the transient time for getting a stationary - like state , and we should regard @xmath115 as the parametric correlation scale .    as strange as it sounds , in order to have dissipation , it is essential to have a breakdown of fopt . in the language of perturbation theory",
    "this implies a required summation of diagrams to _ infinite order _ , leading to an effective broadening of the energy levels . by iterating fopt ,",
    "neglecting interference terms , we get a _",
    "markovian approximation _ for the energy spreading process .",
    "this leads to the diffusion equation of appendix  e. this diffusion can be regarded as arising from fermi - golden - rule transitions between energy levels .",
    "a simple ad - hoc way to determine the energy level broadening is to introduce @xmath94 as a lower cutoff in the energy distribution which is implied by eq.([e_28 ] ) : @xmath116 this constitutes a generalization of the well known procedure used by wigner in order to obtain the local density of states @xcite .",
    "however , in the present context we do not get a lorentzian .",
    "the width parameter @xmath94 is determined self consistently from normalization , leading to eq.([e_42 ] ) [ disregarding numerical prefactor ] .",
    "we can summarize the above reasoning by saying that there is a _ perturbative regime _ that includes an adiabatic ( fopt ) sub - regime .",
    "outside of the adiabatic sub - regime we need _ all orders _ of perturbation theory leading to fermi - golden - rule transitions , diffusion in energy space , and hence dissipation .",
    "thus the dissipative part of kubo formula emerges only in the regime @xmath117 , which is just the opposite of the adiabaticity condition .",
    "the next obvious step is to determine the boundary of the perturbative regime .",
    "following @xcite we argue that the required condition is @xmath118 .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath119 is defined as the energy width @xmath120 were the matrix elements @xmath104 are not vanishingly small .",
    "if the condition @xmath118 is violated we find ourselves in the non - perturbative regime where the kubo formula can not be trusted @xcite .",
    "we still have to illuminate why we can get in the perturbative regime a dissipative _ linear _ response in spite of the breakdown of fopt .",
    "the reason is having a separation of scales ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the non - perturbative mixing on the small energy scale @xmath94 does not affect the rate of first - order transitions between distant levels .",
    "therefore fermi golden rule picture applies to the description of the coarse grained energy spreading , and we get linear response .",
    "the existence of the adiabatic regime is obviously a quantum mechanical effect . if we take the formal limit @xmath122 the adiabaticity condition @xmath123 breaks down .",
    "in fact the _ proper _ classical limit is _ non - perturbative _ , because also the weaker condition @xmath124 does not survive the @xmath122 limit .",
    "for further details see @xcite .",
    "in the non - perturbative regime the quantum mechanical derivation of kubo formula is not valid .",
    "indeed we have demonstrated @xcite the failure of kubo formula in case of random - matrix models .",
    "but if the system has a classical limit , then kubo formula still holds in the non - perturbative regime due to _ semiclassical _ ( rather than quantum - mechanical ) reasons .",
    "the discussion of _ dissipation _ assumes a generic situation such that the schrodinger equation does not have a stationary solution .",
    "this means that driven one - dimensional systems are automatically excluded .",
    "another non - generic possibility is to consider a special driving scheme , such as translation , rotation or dilation @xcite . in such case the time",
    "dependent hamiltonian @xmath15 possesses a stationary solution ( provided the  velocity \" @xmath12 is kept constant ) .",
    "consequently we do not have a dissipation effect . in section  11",
    "we discuss the simplest example of pumping by translation , where the stationary adiabatic solution of section  5 is in fact exact , and no dissipation arises .",
    "so far we have discussed the response for driving in a very general way . from now on we focus on a system with a ring geometry as described in the introduction , and illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the shape of the ring is controlled by some parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath10 is the magnetic flux .",
    "the generalized force @xmath19 which is conjugate to the flux is the current .",
    "the time integral over the current is the transported charge : @xmath125 in fact a less misleading terminology is to talk about  probability current `` and ' ' integrated probability current \" . from a purely mathematical point of view it is not important whether the transported particle has an electrical charge .    disregarding a possible persistent current contribution ,",
    "the expression for the pumped charge is : @xmath126_{k=3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we neglect the first term , which is associated with the dissipation effect , and average the second ( `` adiabatic '' ) term over the flux , then we get @xmath127 the integration should be taken over a cylinder of vertical height @xmath128 , and whose basis is determined by the projection of the pumping cycle onto the @xmath129 plane .",
    "we already pointed out that the berry phase @xmath130 is gauge invariant .",
    "therefore from stokes law it follows that @xmath131 is independent of the surface , and therefore @xmath132 with closed surface should be @xmath133integer . integrating over a cylinder , as in eq.([e7 ] ) , is effectively like integrating over a closed surface ( because of the @xmath134  periodicity in the vertical direction ) .",
    "this means that the flux averaged @xmath0 of eq.([e7 ] ) has to be an integer .",
    "the common interest is in pumping cycles in the @xmath135 plane .",
    "this means that the zero order conservative contribution to  @xmath0 , due to a persistent current , does not exist .",
    "furthermore , from the reciprocity relations ( see appendix  b ) it follows that @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , which should be contrasted with @xmath138 .",
    "this means that a pumping cycle in the @xmath135 plane is purely adiabatic : there is no dissipative contribution to  @xmath0 .",
    "only the @xmath139 field ( second term in eq.([e6 ] ) ) is relevant to the calculation of the pumped charge , and its vertical component @xmath140 vanishes due to the time reversal symmetry .",
    "the absence of dissipative contribution for a cycle in the @xmath135 plane , does not imply that dissipation is not an issue .",
    "the symmetric part of the conductance matrix @xmath92 is in general non - zero , leading to an energy absorption rate which is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "this implies that the energy absorption per cycle is proportional to @xmath142 .",
    "therefore we are able to minimize the dissipation effect by making the pumping cycle very slow . furthermore",
    ", if we get into the quantum - mechanical adiabatic regime , then @xmath92 becomes extremely small , and then we can neglect the dissipation effect as long as quantum - mechanical adiabaticity can be trusted .",
    "whenever the dissipation effect can not be neglected , one should specify whether or how a _ stationary operation _",
    "is achieved . in case of pumping in open system the stationary operation",
    "is implicitly guaranteed by having equilibrated reservoirs , where the extra energy is dissipated to infinity . in case of pumping in closed system the issue of stationary operation",
    "is more subtle : in the adiabatic regime , to the extend that adiabaticity can be trusted , we have a stationary solution to the transport problem , as defined in section  5 .",
    "but outside of the adiabatic regime we have diffusion in energy space ( appendix  e ) leading to a slow energy absorption ( dissipation ) .",
    "thus a driven system is heated up gradually ( though possibly very slowly ) . strictly speaking a stationary operation",
    "is not achieved , unless the system is in ( weak ) thermal contact with some large bath . another way to reach a stationary operation ,",
    "that does not involve an external bath , is by having an effectively bounded phase space .",
    "this is the case with the mixed phase space example which is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "there the stochastic - like motion takes place in a bounded chaotic region in phase space .",
    "before we discuss the quantum mechanical pumping , it is instructive to bring simple examples for _ classical _ pumping . in the following we consider one particle ( @xmath143 ) in a two dimensional ring as in fig.1a .",
    "the first example is for classical _ dissipative _ pumping .",

    "change the conductance from @xmath149 to @xmath150 by modifying the shape of the ring . change the flux from @xmath148 back to @xmath147 , hence pumping charge .",
    "consequently the net pumping is @xmath151 thus we have used the dissipative part of the conductance matrix ( first term in eq.([e6 ] ) ) in order to pump charge . in the quantum mechanical version of this example",
    "extra care should be taken with respect to the zero order contribution of the persistent current .",
    "the second example is for classical _ adiabatic _ pumping .",
    "the idea is to trap the particle inside the ring by a potential well , and then to make a translation of the trap along a circle .",
    "the result of such a cycle is evidently @xmath152 .",
    "we would like to see how this trivial result emerges form the kubo formula .",
    "let @xmath153 be the canonical coordinate of the particle in the ring , while @xmath129 are the center coordinate of a trapping potential .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath154 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & u_{{\\mbox{\\tiny trap}}}({r}_1{-}x_1(t),{r}_2{-}x_2(t))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the components of the momentum along the ring and in the perpendicular ( transverse ) directions .",
    "the pumping is done simply by cycling the position of the trap .",
    "the translation of the trap is assumed to be along an inside circle of radius @xmath157 , @xmath158    in this problem the stationary solution of section  5 is an exact solution .",
    "namely @xmath159 are the eigenfunctions of a particle in the trap .",
    "eq.([e_psit ] ) is just galilei transformation from the moving ( trap ) frame to the laboratory frame .",
    "it is a - priori clear that in this problem the pumped charge per cycle is @xmath152 , irrespective of @xmath160 .",
    "therefore the @xmath139 field must be @xmath161 this can be verified by calculation via eq.([e29 ] ) .",
    "the singularity along the @xmath10 axis is not of quantum mechanical origin : it is not due to degeneracies , but rather due to the diverging current operator ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we turn now to the quantum mechanical case .",
    "consider an adiabatic cycle that involves a particular energy level @xmath75 . this level is assumed to have a degeneracy point at @xmath163 .",
    "it follows that in fact there is a vertical chain of degeneracy points : @xmath164 these degeneracy points are important for the geometrical understanding of the @xmath139 field , as implied by eq.([e29 ] ) .",
    "every degeneracy point is like a monopole charge .",
    "the total flux that emerges from each monopole must be @xmath165integer for a reason that was explained after eq.([e7 ] ) .",
    "thus the monopoles are quantized in units of  @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath139 field which is created ( so to say ) by a vertical chain of monopoles may have a different _ near field _ and _ far field _",

    "later we explain that  far \" means @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the thouless conductance .",

    "qualitatively _ to the same field as in eq.([e_52 ] ) . consequently , for a ",
    "large radius \" pumping cycle in the @xmath135 plane , we get @xmath169 . in the following we are interested in the deviation from exact quantization : if @xmath170 we expect to have @xmath171 , while if @xmath172 we expect @xmath173 . only for the @xmath11",
    "averaged @xmath0 of eq.([e7 ] ) we get _ exact quantization_.    the deviation from @xmath174 is extremely large if we consider a tight pumping cycle around a @xmath170 degeneracy . after linear transformation of the shape parameters ,",

    "what we want to do in the next sections is to interpolate between the near field result , which is @xmath182 , and the far field result , which is @xmath183 . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to consider a particular model that can be solved exactly .",
    "a simple example for quantum pumping is the double barrier model .",
    "an open geometry version of this model has been analyzed in @xcite using the @xmath1  matrix approach .",
    "the analogous closed geometry version is obtained by considering a one - dimensional ring with two delta barriers .",
    "as we are going to explain below , the pumping process in this model can be regarded as a particular example of an adiabatic transfer scheme : the electrons are adiabatically transfered from state to state one by one as in  musical chair game \" .",
    "the two delta barriers version of the double barrier model is illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "the length of the ring is @xmath184 , with periodic boundary conditions on @xmath185 .",
    "a dot region @xmath186 is defined by the potential @xmath187 it is assumed that @xmath188 and @xmath189 are small enough so one can classify the ring eigenstates into two categories : wire states , and dot states .",
    "the latter are those states that are localized in the dot region @xmath186 in the limit of infinitely high barriers .",
    "we define the fermi energy as the energy of the last occupied wire level in the limit of infinitely high barriers .",
    "the three parameters that we can control are the flux @xmath190 , the bias @xmath191 , and the dot potential @xmath192 which is related to @xmath193 .",
    "the energy @xmath194 correspond to the dot state which is closest to the fermi energy @xmath195 from above .",
    "we assume that the other dot levels are much further away from the fermi energy , and can be ignored .",
    "note that another possible way to control the dot potential , is simply by changing a gate voltage : that means to assume that there is a control over the potential floor in the region @xmath186 .    _ the pumping cycle",
    "is assumed to be in the @xmath135 plane , so there is no issue of conservative persistent current contribution_. the pumping cycle is defined as follows : we start with a positive bias ( @xmath196 ) and lower the dot potential from a large @xmath197 value to a small @xmath198 value . as a result , one electron is transfered via the _ left _ barrier into the dot region .",
    "then we invert the bias ( @xmath199 ) and raise back @xmath6 . as a result the electron is transfered back into the wire via the _ right _ barrier",
    ".    a closer look at the above scenario ( fig.2b ) reveals the following : as we lower the dot potential across a wire level , an electron is adiabatically transfered once from left to right and then from right to left .",
    "as long as the bias is positive ( @xmath196 ) the net charge being pumped is very small ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "only the lowest wire level that participate in the pumping cycle carries @xmath183 net charge : it takes an electron from the left side , and after the bias reversal it emits it into the right side . thus the pumping process in this model can be regarded as a particular example @xcite of an _ adiabatic transfer scheme _ : the electrons are adiabatically transfered from state to state , one by one , as in  musical chair game \" .    for a single occupied level",
    "the net @xmath0 is the sum of charge transfer events that take place in four avoided crossings ( two avoided crossings in case of the lowest level ) . for many particle occupation",
    "the total @xmath0 is the sum over the net @xmath0s which are carried by individual levels . for a dense zero temperature fermi occupation",
    "the summation over all the net @xmath0s is a telescopic sum , leaving non - canceling contributions only from the first and the last adiabatic crossings .",
    "the latter involve the last occupied level at the fermi energy .",
    "rather than analyzing the two - delta - barriers version of the double barrier model , we consider below a simplified version that still contains the _ same _ essential ingredients .",
    "this is obtained by considering a three site lattice hamiltonian .",
    "the advantage is obviously the possibility to make an exact analytical treatment that does not involve approximations .",
    "the middle site in the three site lattice hamiltonian supports a single dot state , while the two other sites support two wire states .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath201 the three parameters are the bias @xmath191 , the dot energy @xmath202 , and the flux @xmath190 . for presentation purpose",
    "we assume that , and characterize the wire - dot coupling by the parameter @xmath203 .",
    "the eigenstates are @xmath64 . disregarding the interaction with the dot ( @xmath204 ) we have two wire states with .",
    "this implies degeneracies for @xmath205 .",
    "once we switch on the coupling ( @xmath206 ) , the only possible degeneracies are between the even dot state and the odd wire state of the mirror symmetric hamiltonian ( @xmath207 ) . the flux should be either integer ( for degeneracy of the dot level with the lower wire level ) , or half integer ( for degeneracy of the dot level with the upper wire level ) .",
    "thus we have two vertical chains of degeneracies : @xmath208    in order to calculate the @xmath139 field and pumped charge @xmath0 , we have to find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the secular equation for the eigenvalues is @xmath209 using the notations @xmath210 the roots of the above cubic equation are : @xmath211 where @xmath212 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are : @xmath213 where @xmath1 is the normalization , namely @xmath214 for the calculation of the pumped charge in the next paragraph it is useful to notice that for @xmath215 the normalization is @xmath216 , while for @xmath217 the normalization is @xmath218 .",
    "after some algebra we find that the first component of the @xmath139 field in the @xmath135 plane is @xmath219 which is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "from here it follow that if we keep constant bias , and change only @xmath202 , then the pumped charge is : @xmath220 for a planar ( @xmath135 ) pumping cycle around the negative vertical chain the main contribution to @xmath0 comes from the two crossings of the @xmath221 line .",
    "hence we get @xmath222 where the thouless conductance in this context refers to the avoided crossing , and is defined as @xmath223 a similar calculation of the pumped charge for a planar cycle around the positive chain leads to @xmath224 with @xmath225 . in both cases",
    "we have approximate quantization @xmath226 for @xmath167 , while for a tight cycle either @xmath227 or @xmath228 depending on which line of degeneracies is being encircled .",
    "if the pumping cycle encircles both chains then we get @xmath229 . in the latter case @xmath230 for @xmath167 , with no indication for quantization",
    "we have shown how the kubo formalism can be used in order to derive both classical and quantum mechanical results for the pumped charge @xmath0 in a closed system . in this formulation",
    "the distinction between dissipative and non - dissipative contributions is manifest .    within the framework of the kubo formalism ( disregarding non - linear corrections )",
    "we have made a distinction between the following levels of treatment : +    * strict adiabaticity + ( outcome of zero order treatment ) * adiabatic transport + ( outcome of stationary first order treatment ) * dissipation + ( the result of first order transitions )    in the adiabatic regime one can assume a _ stationary _ solution to the adiabatic equation , which implies no dissipation effect .",
    "this leads to the picture of adiabatic transport , where the berry phase is the outcome of a zero order treatment , while the  geometric magnetism \" of eq.([e_30 ] ) is the outcome of a first order treatment of the inter - level couplings .    in some very special cases ( translations , rotations and dilations )",
    "this assumption ( of having a stationary solution ) is in fact exact , but in generic circumstance this assumption is an approximation .",
    "outside of the adiabatic regime the stationary solution can not be trusted .",
    "assuming quantized _ chaotic dynamics _",
    "one argues that fermi - golden - rule transitions between levels lead to ( slow ) diffusion in energy ( eq.([ed1 ] ) ) .",
    "this leads to the emergence of the dissipative part in the kubo formula .",
    "we have obtained an expression ( eq.([e_42 ] ) ) for the energy scale @xmath231 that controls the dissipative effect .",
    "we have explained that the dissipative contribution to the kubo formula is valid only in the regime @xmath232 .",
    "otherwise the dynamics is either of adiabatic nature ( @xmath123 ) or non - perturbative ( @xmath117 ) .    in order to calculate the pumped charge  @xmath0 we have to perform a closed line integral over the conductance ( eq.([e6 ] ) ) .",
    "this may have in general both adiabatic and dissipative contributions .",
    "for the common pumping cycle in the @xmath135 plane , only the adiabatic contribution exists .",
    "this follows from the reciprocity relations ( section  9 ) .",
    "still we have emphasized ( without any contradiction ) that in the same circumstances a dissipation effect typically accompanies the pumping process .    the quantum adiabatic contribution to the pumping",
    "is determined by a line integral over a @xmath139 field which is created by _",
    "monopoles_. the monopoles , which are related to the degeneracies of the hamiltonian , are located along vertical chains in @xmath40  space ( eq.([e_chain ] ) ) .",
    "the 3  site model provides the simplest example for such vertical chains : by calculating the @xmath139 field which is created ( so to say ) by these chains , we were able to determine the charge which is pumped during a cycle ( e.g. eq.([e_qmodel ] ) ) .",
    "the ( monopoles of the ) vertical chains have _ near field _ regions ( eq.([e9 ] ) )",
    ". if the chains are well isolated in @xmath40 space , then there are also _ far field _ regions .",
    "the far field regions are defined as those where the thouless conductance is very small ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "pumping cycles that are contained in the far field region of a given chain lead to an approximately quantized pumping .",
    "it is important to realize that the existence of far field regions in @xmath40  space is associated with having a low dimensional system far away from the classical limit . in a quantized chaotic system it is unlikely to have @xmath167 along a pumping cycle .",
    "as we take the @xmath233 limit the vertical chains become very dense , and the far field regions disappear .    in the subtle limiting case of open geometry",
    "we expect to get agreement with the @xmath1-matrix formula of bttiker prtre and thomas ( bpt ) @xcite . using the notations of the present paper the bpt formula for the current that comes out of ( say )",

    "it follows that the rate of energy absorption is @xmath298 for a microcanonical preparation we get @xmath299\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this diffusion - dissipation relation reduces immediately to the fluctuation - dissipation relation if we assume that the diffusion in energy space due to the driving is given by @xmath300 thus it is clear that a theory for linear response should establish that there is a diffusion process in energy space due to the driving , and that the diffusion coefficient is given by eq.([e49 ] ) .",
    "more importantly , this approach also allows treating cases where the expression for @xmath301 is non - perturbative , while the diffusion - dissipation relation eq.([e48 ] ) still holds !    a full exposition ( and further reference ) for this route of derivation can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we shall give just the classical derivation of eq.([e49 ] ) , which is extremely simple .",
    "we start with the identity @xmath302 assuming ( for presentation purpose ) that the rates @xmath303 are constant numbers , it follows that energy changes are related to the fluctuating @xmath304 as follows : @xmath305 squaring this expression , and performing microcanonical averaging over initial conditions we obtain : @xmath306 where @xmath307 is the correlation function . for very short times",
    "this equation implies `` ballistic '' spreading ( @xmath308 ) while on _ intermediate time scales _ it leads to diffusive spreading , where @xmath309 the latter result assumes a short correlation time .",
    "this is also the reason that the integration over @xmath310 can be extended form @xmath311 to @xmath312 .",
    "hence we get eq.([e49 ] ) .",
    "we note that for long times the systems deviates significantly from the initial microcanonical preparation .",
    "hence , for long times , one should justify the use of the diffusion equation ( [ ed1 ] ) .",
