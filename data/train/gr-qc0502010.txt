    "it is well known that the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of a black hole is defined as proper solutions of the perturbation equations belonging to certain complex characteristic frequencies which satisfy the boundary conditions appropriate for purely ingoing waves at the event horizon and purely outgoing waves at infinity @xcite .",
    "the original interest in qnms of black hole arose due to they are characteristics of black holes which do not depend on initial perturbations .",
    "it is generally believed that qnms carry a unique footprint to directly identify the existence of a black hole . through the qnms",
    ", one can extract information about the physical parameters of the black hole ",
    "mass , electric charge , and angular momentum  from the gravitational wave signal by fitting the few lowest observed quasinormal frequencies to those calculated from the perturbation analysis , as well as test the stability of the event horizon against small perturbations .",
    "recently , this interest has been renewed since the qnms may be related to fundamental physics , such as the thermodynamic properties of black holes in loop quantum gravity @xcite @xcite since the real part of quasinormal frequencies with a large imaginary part for the scalar field in the schwarzschild black hole is equal to the barbero - immirzi parameter @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , a factor introduced by hand in order that loop quantum gravity reproduces correctly the entropy of the black hole , and the qnms of anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes have a direction interpretation in terms of the dual conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , a large static black hole in asymptotically ads spacetime corresponds to a thermal state in cft , and the decay of the test field in the black hole spacetime corresponds to the decay of the perturbed state in cft .",
    "the dynamical timescale for the return to thermal equilibrium can be done in ads spacetime , and then translated onto the cft , using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it is quasinormal frequencies that give us the thermalization timescale which is very hard to compute directly .",
    "therefore , many authors have delved into studies of qnms associated with scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in various asymptotically ads black holes @xcite .    although much attention has been paid to the study of the qnms for scalar , gravitational , electromagnetic field perturbations in the sads and the reissner - norstrm ads black - hole backgrounds , however , to my best knowledge , at the moment the study of the qnms for dirac field perturbation in asymptotically ads spacetime is still an open question .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the qnms associated with the decay of the dirac field perturbation around a sads black hole .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the decoupled dirac equations and corresponding wave equations in the sads spacetime are obtained by using newman - penrose formalism . in sec .",
    "3 the numerical approach to computing the dirac qnms is introduced . in sec .",
    "4 the numerical results for the dirac qnms in the sads black hole are presented .",
    "is devoted to a summary . in appendix",
    "we present the relations between our wave - equation and the standard one .",
    "we begin with the sads metric @xmath0 with @xmath1 where m represents the black hole mass , and r is the anti - de sitter radius .",
    "hereafter we will take @xmath2 and measure everything in terms of @xmath3 .",
    "the black hole horizon is located at @xmath4 , the largest root of the function @xmath5 , and its hawking temperature is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a surface gravity .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath8 can be viewed as a function of the horizon radius @xmath9    the dirac equations @xcite are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is covariant differentiation , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the two - component spinors representing the wave function , @xmath14 is the complex conjugate of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the particle mass . in the newman - penrose formalism",
    "@xcite the equations become @xmath17 for the sads spacetime ( [ metric ] ) the null tetrad can be taken as @xmath18 with @xmath19 then , if we set @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy and angular momentum of the dirac particles , eq .",

    "so , we have @xmath39 for both cases @xmath31 and @xmath33 .    in this paper",

    "we note that potentials which are functions of complex frequency have always been used to study qnms in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite because the key point to investigate qnms is that we should get solutions of the original equations with appropriate boundary conditions presented in the introduction .",
    "we should point out here that , for the dirac fields , we can also obtain another two standard wave - equations @xmath52 with the potentials @xmath53 by using similar approach in refs . @xcite@xcite@xcite . at first sight",
    "the potentials are simpler than eq .",
    "( [ poten ] ) .",
    "however , if the dirac quasinormal frequencies of the sads black hole are studied by using the potentials @xmath54 and horowitz - hubeny approach@xcite , we find that we can not expand the potentials about the event horizon @xmath4 due to the potentials include a non - polynomial factor @xmath55 .",
    "although we can expand them about @xmath56 with @xmath57 , the expansion function will be an infinite series .",
    "therefore , the numerical calculation will take very long computer time to get dirac fundamental quasinormal frequencies , and it is very difficult to find higher overtone modes . on the other hand , in appendix we present the relations between the two kinds of the wave functions in our wave - equation and the standard one which imply that the quasinormal frequencies are the same for both cases .",
    "these are the reasons why we use the potential ( [ poten ] ) to study dirac qnms of the sads black hole here .",
    "for the sads black hole , the potential ( [ poten ] ) diverges at infinity , so we must require that @xmath58 vanish there .",
    "qnms are defined to be modes with only ingoing waves near the event horizon .",
    "the boundary conditions on wave function @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) at the horizon @xmath60 and infinity @xmath61 can be expressed mathematically as @xmath62 equations ( [ wave ] ) , ( [ poten ] ) and ( [ bon ] ) determine an eigenvalue problem for the quasinormal frequency @xmath21 of the dirac field perturbation .    in what follows",
    ", we will calculate the quasinormal frequencies for outgoing dirac field ( i.e. , for case @xmath33 @xcite ) by using the horowitz - hubeny approach @xcite .",
