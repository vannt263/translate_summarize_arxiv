    ", the small - scale dynamo could provide a source for large - scale dynamo action , especially if rotation is present @xcite .",
    "moreover , the regime of low magnetic prandtl numbers is important in the case of liquid metal laboratory experiments , which also show the existence of a turbulent dynamo ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we prove that the wkb approximation is valid for small to moderate pm .",
    "the small - scale dynamo converts kinetic energy from turbulent motions into magnetic energy .",
    "an illustrative model describing this process is the stretch - twist - fold dynamo @xcite .",
    "the stretching of a closed magnetic flux rope leads to amplification of the magnetic field strength , as the magnetic flux is a conserved quantity .",
    "afterwards the rope is stretched , twisted and folded such that the original shape is regained .",
    "the shorter the turnover time of the turbulent eddies is , the faster the stretch - twist - fold mechanism proceeds and thus the faster the magnetic field is amplified",

    "+ during the transition from large to small magnetic prandtl numbers , the resistive scale @xmath21 becomes larger than the viscous one .",
    "the amplification then takes place at roughly @xmath22 , which lies in the inertial range of the turbulent velocity spectrum . due to larger time scales of the turbulent eddies in the inertial range",

    "<S> the present - day universe is highly magnetized , even though the first magnetic seed fields were most probably extremely weak . to explain the growth of the magnetic field strength over many orders of magnitude fast amplification processes need to operate . </S>",
    "<S> the most efficient mechanism known today is the small - scale dynamo , which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the dynamo depends on the type of turbulence indicated by the slope of the turbulence spectrum @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the eddy velocity at a scale @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we explore turbulent spectra ranging from incompressible kolmogorov turbulence with @xmath3 to highly compressible burgers turbulence with @xmath4 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the properties of the small - scale dynamo for low magnetic prandtl numbers pm , which denotes the ratio of the magnetic reynolds number , rm , to the hydrodynamical one , re . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the kazantsev equation , which describes the evolution of the small - scale magnetic field , using the wkb approximation . in the limit of low magnetic prandtl numbers </S>",
    "<S> the growth rate is proportional to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore discuss the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath6 , which is required for small - scale dynamo action . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath6 is roughly 100 for kolmogorov turbulence and 2700 for burgers . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss that @xmath6 provides a stronger constraint in the limit of low pm than it does for large pm . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the small - scale dynamo can operate in the regime of low magnetic prandtl numbers , if the magnetic reynolds number is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the magnetic field amplification on small scales can take place in a broad range of physical environments and amplify week magnetic seed fields on short timescales . </S>"
