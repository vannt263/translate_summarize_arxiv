    "quantum computers manipulate two level quantum systems called qubits that can be arbitrary superpositions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "while the idea of a quantum computer was first suggested by benioff and feynman in the early 80s @xcite , the first quantum algorithm that could solve an interesting real world problem faster than it s classical equivalent was published by shor in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "shor s algorithm factorizes integers with the number of steps growing polynomially in the number of digits whereas the best known classical algorithm grows exponentially .",
    "a significant milestone in the quest to build a quantum computer was the construction of a 7 qubit liquid nmr implementation of shor s algorithm designed to factorize 15 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the liquid nmr approach is not expected to work beyond a few tens of qubits @xcite .",
    "many different technologies are being researched in the hope of producing a scalable quantum computer .",
    "a sample of the diverse proposals can be found in @xcite . in kane s solid state proposal @xcite , the nuclear spins of single @xmath6p dopant atoms in @xmath7si",
    "are used as qubits .",
    "this approach aims to take maximum advantage of the industry expertise acquired during the last 50 years of conventional semiconductor electronics .    in this paper",
    "we study the error rate of cnot operations in the kane quantum computer .",
    "initial simulations were carried out without dephasing to enable the pulse profiles of the controlling electrodes to be optimized @xcite .",
    "the lowest error rate achieved in the absence of dephasing was @xmath8 . when a physically reasonable level of dephasing was included in the simulation ,",
    "the error rate increased to approximately @xmath0 .",
    "while theoretical estimates of the error rate required for fault tolerant computation are of order @xmath9 @xcite , numerical simulations by zalka suggest an error rate of @xmath0 or higher may be tolerable @xcite .",
    "further work is required to determine the maximum allowed error rate in the kane architecture .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : kqc ] the physical architecture of the kane quantum computer",
    "is described . in section [ section : cnot ]",
    "the process of performing a cnot operation in the kane architecture is presented with emphasis on achieving the lowest possible error rate in the absence of dephasing .",
    "further details of this process can be found in @xcite . in section [ section : deph ] our model of dephasing is described and its effect on the error rate of the cnot gate . in section [ section : conc ] we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our estimate of the likely minimum error rate of the kane cnot gate .",
    "the @xmath6p in @xmath7si system is thought to be well suited to use as a qubit due to it s long relaxation ( t@xmath10 ) and dephasing ( t@xmath11 ) times .",
    "both times only have meaning when the system is in a steady magnetic field . assuming the field is parallel with the z - axis",
    ", the relaxation time refers to the time taken for @xmath12 of the spins in the sample to spontaneously flip whereas the dephasing time refers to the time taken for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 components of a single spin to decay by a factor of @xmath12 . in natural silicon containing 4.7% @xmath15si , relaxation times t@xmath10 in excess 1 hour have been observed for the donor electron at t=1.25k and b@xmath160.3 t @xcite .",
    "the nuclear relaxation time has been estimated at over 80 hours in similar conditions @xcite .",
    "the donor electron dephasing time t@xmath11 in enriched @xmath7si containing @xmath17 @xmath15si @xcite has been measured at t=1.4k to be @xmath160.5ms @xcite . at the time of writing",
    ", no experimental data relating to the nuclear dephasing time has been obtained to the authors knowledge .",
    "the phosphorous donor electrons are used primarily to mediate interactions between neighboring nuclear qubits . as such",
    ", they are polarized to remove their spin degree of freedom from the system .",
    "this can be achieved by maintaining a steady b@xmath18=2 t at around t=4k @xcite . to take advantage of the long t@xmath10 and t@xmath11 times discussed in the previous paragraph",
    ", the operating temperature will more likely need to be @xmath161k .",
    "techniques for relaxing the high field and low temperature requirements such as spin refrigeration are under investigation @xcite .    in the kane architecture , qubits are arranged in a single line .",
    "control is achieved via electrodes above and between each qubit and a global transverse oscillating field of magnitude @xmath16@xmath0 t ( fig .",
    "[ figure:3q ] ) .    to selectively manipulate a single qubit",
    ", the a - electrode above it is biased .",
    "a positive / negative bias draws / drives the donor electron away from the nucleus reducing the magnitude of the interaction between the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "this in turn reduces the energy difference between nuclear spin up ( @xmath3 ) and down ( @xmath4 ) allowing this transition to be brought into resonance with a globally applied oscillating magnetic field . depending on the timing of the a - electrode bias ,",
    "the qubit can be rotated into an arbitrary superposition @xmath19 .",
    "clearly this scheme also allows arbitrary combinations of individual qubits to be simultaneously and independently manipulated .",
    "interactions between neighboring qubits are governed by the j - electrodes . a positive bias encourages greater overlap of the donor electron wave functions leading to indirect coupling of their associated nuclei . in analogy to the single qubit case , this allows two qubit transitions to be performed selectively between arbitrary neighbors .",
    "a discussion of the electrode pulses required to implement a cnot gate is given in the next section .",
    "performing a cnot operation on a kane qc is an involved process described in detail in @xcite .",
    "given the high field ( 2 t ) and low temperature ( @xmath161k ) operating conditions , we can model the behavior of the system with a spin hamiltonian .",
    "only two qubits are required to perform a cnot operations so for the remainder of the paper we will restrict our attention to a computer with just two qubits .",

    "the dependance of these quantities on their associated electrode voltages is a subject of ongoing research @xcite . in this paper",
    "the hyperfine and exchange interaction magnitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 will frequently be discussed as though directly manipulable .",

    "is increased ( qubit 1 will be assumed to be the control qubit for the remainder of the paper ) .",
    "step two is to gradually apply a positive potential to the j electrode in order to force greater overlap of the donor electron wave functions and hence greater ( indirect ) coupling of the underlying nuclear qubits .",
    "the rate of this change is limited so as to be adiabatic  qubits initially in energy eigenstates remain in energy eigenstates throughout this step .",

    "anti - level - crossing behavior changes the input states as @xmath48symm@xmath47 and @xmath49anti@xmath47 .",
    "step four is the application of an oscillating field @xmath39 resonant with the @xmath46symm@xmath50 transition .",

    "can be increased arbitrarily by making them indefinitely long . in reality , of course , this is not practical and the procedure must be implemented on a time - scale that is short compared to the systems dephasing time . for a given @xmath53 , the degree to which the evolution deviates from perfect adiabaticity can quantified by the measure @xcite @xmath54 .",

    "it is possible to reduce @xmath58 without increasing the duration of the step by optimizing the profiles of the time dependent parameters in the hamiltonian . in the case of the kane architecture",
    "this means optimizing the shape of the evolution of @xmath59 and @xmath36 .",
    "various profiles for the adiabatic steps in the cnot procedure have been investigated in @xcite . in ( fig .",

    "the system undergoes a level crossing . to maintain adiabatic evolution",
    ", @xmath36 needs to change more slowly near this value .",
    "note that the reason it is desirable to make @xmath36 so large is to ensure that there is a large energy difference between @xmath46symm@xmath47 and @xmath46anti@xmath47 during step 4 ( the application of @xmath39 ) .",
    "this difference is given by @xmath67 without a large energy difference , the oscillating field @xmath39 which is set to resonate with the transition @xmath46symm@xmath68 will also be very close to resonant with @xmath46anti@xmath68 causing a large error during the operation of the cnot gate . while it is desirable to make @xmath36 large , it must be kept comfortably below @xmath69 as near this level crossing the time required to adiabatically increase @xmath36 increases significantly .",
    "step 3 ( the decreasing of @xmath41 ) could be performed without degrading the overall fidelity of the gate in a time of less than a micro - second with a linear pulse profile .",

    "@xmath71.\\ ] ] the times used for each stage are as follows    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the precision of the duration of stage 4 is required as the oscillating field @xmath39 induces the states @xmath45 and @xmath46symm@xmath47 to swap smoothly back and forth . the duration 7.5989@xmath72 is the time required for one swap .",
    "the other step times were obtained by first setting them to arbitrary values ( @xmath165@xmath72 ) and increasing them until the gate fidelity ceased to increase .",
    "the step times were then decreased one by one until the fidelity started to decrease .",

    "this maximum fidelity was found to be @xmath8 for all computation basis states .",
    "in this paper , dephasing is modelled as exponential decay of the off diagonal components of the density matrix .",
    "while a large variety of dephasing models exist @xcite , this approximation is consistent with the first order nature of the spin hamiltonian .",
