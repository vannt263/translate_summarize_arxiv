    "quantum versions of random walks have been extensively studied for the past three decades , leading to a range of applications . in this paper",
    "we focus on their transport properties .",
    "their potentially exponential quantum speed up over equivalent classical random walk transport was first proved in an algorithmic setting by @xcite @xcite on a hypercubic graph , followed by @xcite @xcite on a specially chosen `` glued trees '' graph . in a physical setting , quantum transport on spin chains",
    "@xcite is isomorphic to continuous - time quantum walks .",
    "this lead to intensive study of how to optimise quantum state transfer over short chains , as reviewed by @xcite @xcite , with applications as quantum wires to connect components in quantum devices for communication and computation .",
    "quantum walks can also reproduce the phenomenon of anderson localisation @xcite , highlighting the importance of controlling the quantum walk parameters to achieve efficient transport .",
    "studies by @xcite @xcite expose the role of symmetry in the underlying graph structures in quantum walk transport .    noting the importance of graphene and related substances as materials with many interesting electrical properties @xcite in this paper we apply quantum versions of random walks to study quantum transport properties on various structures based on 60 and graphene lattices .",
    "the variation in conductivity of graphene is exploited in diverse application @xcite .",
    "recently , continuous - time quantum walks on graphene lattices have been studied by @xcite @xcite to implement a quantum walk search algorithm , and apply this to communications between selected nodes on the lattice .",
    "the lattice is also called `` honeycomb '' and other studies of quantum walks on this type of graph can be found in @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions for quantum walks on graph structures are challenging .",
    "even the simplest cases of the cycle @xcite , hypercube @xcite and cartesian lattices @xcite require significant mathematical effort . for perfect state transfer on small graphs , where the quantum state of the walker is exactly reproduced at the target node",
    ", analytical results are known for a few special cases , reviewed by @xcite @xcite .",
    "this is also because perfect state transfer is hard to achieve in general , and for many applications it is sufficient to obtain fast probabilistic transfer .",
    "analytical solutions usually require a homogeneous graph structure , either finite or infinite , or parameter tweaking for each situation @xcite .",
    "there are techniques to compose compatible small graph structures into larger ones @xcite for which the analytical solutions can also be combined , but there are limitations to this method . for studies on more general structures ,",
    "numerical simulation is the best option , allowing the range of structures to be extended to be more practically relevant .",
    "it is also generally the case that discrete - time and continuous - time quantum walks give similar results on the same graphs , and their equivalence has been shown analytically for the line @xcite using a method that can be expected to generalise for other homogeneous lattices . while the continuous - time walk can be more tractable analytically , for numerical simulation the unitary operators of the discrete - time walk are more convenient than the numerical integration required for the continuous - time walk .",
    "we therefore carried out our studies using the discrete - time quantum walk .",
    "discrete , coined quantum walks can be implemented using atoms trapped in optical lattices , for example , and honeycomb lattices can be created this way .",
    "internal degrees of freedom of the atoms then play the role of the quantum coin , by coupling to the direction of motion of the atoms as the optical lattice is modulated @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : qw ] we define our model of a quantum walk and discuss its behaviour on cycles . in section [ sec : results ] we apply the quantum walks to 60 and graphene nanotubes , focusing on the efficiency of transport between specified points on the structures . in section [ sec : conc ] we summarise our findings and discuss their applications and directions for future research .",
    "we define a discrete - time , coined , quantum walk on a regular , connected , undirected graph @xmath0 as follows .",
    "first we specify the graph on which the quantum walk takes place . for a graph @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes ,",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of nodes and @xmath3 be the set of edges connecting pairs of nodes .",
    "we label each node with a unique number @xmath4 , and identify the edges by the labels of the nodes they connect .",
    "thus , for @xmath5 , we have @xmath6 iff there is an edge @xmath7 connecting node @xmath8 to node @xmath9 .",
    "graph @xmath0 is undirected , i.e. , @xmath10 and connected , i.e. , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 , and there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes .",
    "the degree @xmath15 of node @xmath16 is the number of edges meeting at @xmath9 . for a regular graph of degree @xmath17",
    "we have @xmath18 @xmath19 . in order to support the dynamics of the quantum walk , at each node",
    "@xmath16 we label the ends of the edges at that node from @xmath20 in an arbitrary but fixed order . for @xmath21 , we define an edge label function @xmath22 that returns the ordered pair of labels at the other end of the @xmath23th edge at node @xmath8 , i.e. , the @xmath24th edge at node @xmath9 .    a discrete - time , coined quantum walk on a regular , connected , undirected graph @xmath0 has a discrete hilbert space @xmath25 where @xmath26 has dimension @xmath1 corresponding to the number of nodes , and @xmath27 has dimension @xmath17 , corresponding to the number of edges @xmath17 meeting at each node .",
    "we choose a natural and convenient set of basis states @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a quantum walker can thus be thought of as a particle with an internal degree of freedom of dimension @xmath17 that is located on a node , or in superposition on nodes , of the graph .",
    "a general state @xmath31 of the quantum walker at time @xmath32 can be written @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath34 are complex amplitudes normalised such that @xmath35 .",
    "the dynamics of the quantum walk are unitary in discrete unit time intervals .",
    "we utilize a * flip - flop * shift operator @xmath36 . for the benefit of those readers who are unfamiliar with the action of this shift operator",
    ", we will explain its action in detail for clarity .",
    "the operator @xmath36 acts on both the coin state and position of the walker to move it between nodes that are connected by edges .",
    "it is defined by its action on the basis states , @xmath37 making use of the edge label function defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : edge_label_function ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath38 , hence @xmath39 , confirming that @xmath36 is its own inverse , and therefore unitary . a coin operator @xmath40 acts only on the coin degrees of freedom .",
    "we are free to choose @xmath40 to be any unitary operation of dimension @xmath17 .",
    "there are some natural choices for @xmath40 that we will introduce and discuss later .",
    "the role of the coin operator is equivalent to tossing the coin in a classical random walk : it rearranges the amplitudes for different coin states .",
    "a single step of the quantum walk consists of a coin operation followed by a shift , giving @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the identity operation on the position space @xmath43 of the quantum walker .",
    "a quantum walk of @xmath44 steps from an initial state of @xmath45 can be written @xmath46    the initial state has a significant impact on the subsequent quantum walk , unlike for a classical random walk , where the initial state is irrelevant to the long time behavior .",
    "this is because the quantum walk is a deterministic , unitary dynamics .",
    "the range of choices for the initial state is large , and we are interested in transport properties that are not particularly sensitive to the choice of initial state . for the quantum walk on the line , for example , the spreading rate is linear , regardless of the initial state @xcite . for the studies presented here",
    ", we used unbiased , symmetric initial states , either in terms of the coin states at a single node , or an equal superposition of such states on a group of neighboring nodes .    to motivate our choices of coin operators , we first consider a quantum walk on one of the simplest small graph structures , the cycle .",
    "a cycle @xmath47 with @xmath1 nodes has a set of edges @xmath48 with @xmath29 and addition modulo-@xmath1 , so that node @xmath49 is connected to node @xmath50 .",
    "the shift operator is thus @xmath51 where we have used a consistent labeling of the nodes and ends of the edges such that the label @xmath52 is on the end of the edge that connects node @xmath53 to node @xmath54 and vice versa for label @xmath50 , see figure [ fig : cycle ] .",
    "this choice of labels is not necessary , but it does simplify the analysis , both numerical and analytical .     with 18 nodes , showing a convenient set of node ( j ) and edge ( @xmath55 ) labels as described in the text .",
    "the two opposite nodes are designated ` initial ' and ` target ' , and the nodes between them are mapped in pairs ( as colored , shaded in grey in print ) to a set of levels , so the progress towards the target node can be quantified.[fig : cycle ] ]    the cycle has degree @xmath56 , so we need a 2-dimensional coin operator .",
    "ideally , we also want our coin operator to be unbiased , so that no matter which direction the walker arrived from it has an equal chance of leaving by either edge .",
    "we can achieve this by using the hadamard operator @xmath57 a symmetric form @xmath58 can also be used . in general , a phase factor of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the above , respectively ) can be distributed in various equivalent ways , with corresponding cosmetic changes in the quantum walk @xcite .",
    "the discrete - time quantum walk on the cycle was solved analytically by @xcite @xcite , and its properties are well - studied .",
    "of particular note for our purposes is its use in quantum state transfer . using cycles of even-@xmath1 size ,",
    "the quantum walk starts at one node with the aim of reaching the opposite node .",
    "first noted for @xmath62 by @xcite @xcite , this can provide perfect state transfer for suitably chosen coin operators ( not always the unbiased hadamards ) @xcite and initial states .",
    "we used a corresponding size of @xmath1-cycle to provide a benchmark for evaluating the performance of quantum walk transport on graphene structures .",
    "our numerical simulation code was written in python 3.5 using the numpy , scipy , and matplotlib packages @xcite .",
    "most of the simulations took no more than a few minutes each on standard desktop computers , so no special numerical optimisation techniques were required .",
    "figures of the 60 and nanotube structures were drawn using virtual nanolab @xcite .",
    "there are many possible properties of quantum walks that can be calculated . for the smallest simulations",
    ", we visualised the probability distribution step - by - step to obtain a detailed picture of the behaviour .",
    "we then calculated the average position over time , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the position mapped to levels as shown in figure [ fig : cycle ] , @xmath65 we also calculated the accumulated arrival probability @xmath66 .",
    "the accumulated arrival probability is equivalent to putting a `` sink '' at the target node , and summing the probability of the walker being in the sink after each step of the quantum walk @xmath67 where @xmath23 is the target node , and @xmath68 is reset to zero before the next step of the quantum walk is applied .",
    "this is a non - unitary process with a practical operational interpretation . after each step of the quantum walk ,",
    "the target node is measured to check for the presence of the walker .",
    "it will be found with probability @xmath69 . with probability",
    "@xmath70 the walker is somewhere else on the graph , and the quantum walk continues to evolve , but without the amplitude on node @xmath23 , because we just found out it is nt there . note that @xmath66 is a monotonically - increasing function of time , because once the quantum walker has arrived at node @xmath23 , it does nt leave it . after comparing @xmath63 with @xmath66 , we chose the latter as the clearest indicator of successful quantum transport .    with the sink at the target site ,",
    "analytical solution is even more challenging .",
    "for the cycle , a numerical comparison of average position and arrival probability is shown in figure [ fig : qwcycle ] , along with the equivalent quantities for a classical random walk , for comparison .     with @xmath71 nodes mapped to ten levels from start ( @xmath50 ) to target node ( @xmath72 ) , see figure [ fig : cycle ] .",
    "average position ( grey , left axis ) and arrival probability ( blue , right axis , dark grey in print ) plotted against the number of time steps for coin operator @xmath73 ( solid ) .",
    "a classical random walk using an unbiased 2-sided coin ( black ) shown for comparison.[fig : qwcycle ] ]    for short times , the quantum walk arrives sooner , and the arrival probability approaches unity faster , than the classical random walk . for longer times , the curves cross and the classical random walk approaches unity faster . for very long times , both asymptote to unity ( see supplementary material ) . in general , a quadratic speed up is expected for quantum walks on the cycle when compared with a classical random walk @xcite .",
    "this is an asymptotic result for large cycles and does not apply directly to small cycles like @xmath74 .",
    "the short time behavior , a steep rise in the arrival probability in the first 20 time steps , is the quantum speed up in this instance .",
    "there is another natural choice for the coin operator that models many realistic situations . as well as shifting to a connected node at each time step",
    ", the quantum walker may have a third choice , to stay at the current node .",
    "this can be achieved using a coin of dimension @xmath75 .",
    "thus , for the cycle , this needs a coin of dimension three .",
    "we tested the walk on the cycle using a coin operator known as a grover coin operator .",
    "the grover coin operator can be defined for any dimension @xmath76 , @xmath77 for @xmath56 it reduces to the pauli @xmath78 operator , which corresponds to steps in a single direction ( completely biased ) . in three dimensions , it is @xmath79 the grover coin operator has the highest degree of symmetry possible in a unitary operator .",
    "the incoming direction is already special , but all other directions are treated exactly the same for both amplitude and phase of the outgoing state . the arrival probability for the quantum walk with a @xmath80 coin operator is shown in figure [ fig : qwcycle3d ] .     with @xmath71 nodes mapped to ten levels from start ( @xmath50 ) to target node ( @xmath72 ) , see figure [ fig : cycle ] .",

    "the fourier coin operator reduces to the hadamard coin operator in equation ( [ eq : hadamard ] ) .",
    "the fourier coin operator is unbiased for all dimensions , i.e. , the walker is equally likely to leave by any available edge , regardless of which it arrived along .",
    "however , this comes at a cost of the relative phases being different for each direction , to ensure the coin operator is unitary overall .",
    "since the phase factors are what gives the quantum walk its advantage over the classical random walk , the fourier coin operator can produce very different quantum walk behaviors when compared with the grover coin operator . using @xmath81 for a cycle with a `` wait state '' is also shown in figure [ fig : qwcycle3d ] .",
    "out of all these choices for coin operator , we can see the hadamard coin is the fastest , both @xmath73 and @xmath80 beat the classical random walk for short times , while @xmath81 only beats the classical three - sided coin for short times , and in fact never reaches the opposite side with certainty , see appendix .",
    "we now present our results for the transport properties of quantum walks on 60 and various carbon nanotube structures .",
    "first , the different possible coin operators are compared on 60 .",
    "then the role of symmetry in the structures themselves is investigated , by using different combinations of starting nodes and target nodes . finally , we studied nanotubes made from cylinders of graphene , both with capped ends and as loops , to explore how the width and length affect the overall transport efficiency .",
    "the graphene structures that are the focus of our work all have nodes with @xmath84 .",
    "our first investigation was to compare several natural choices of coin operators , to see how sensitive the transport properties are to different coin operations .",
    "clearly , the @xmath80 coin of equation ( [ eq : g3coin ] ) is an obvious choice , along with @xmath81 .",
    "we can also choose a @xmath85 coin with a `` wait state '' , with corresponding four - dimensional coin operators .",
    "we tested @xmath86 and @xmath87 and also a tensor product of two hadamard coin operators , @xmath88 . in a similar manor as for the cycle , we chose an initial node on the 60 structure and designated the opposite node the target node , see figure [ fig : c60levels1 ] .",

    "this is likely due to the contribution from the caps reducing as a proportion of the total length for longer nanotubes .",
    "the long time behaviour of both is shown in the appendix .",

    "we have demonstrated that transport for discrete time quantum random walks is significantly faster on graphs corresponding to a variety of real world nanostructures than it is on simple cycles . in particular , we have demonstrated this for a 60 fullerene graph and a variety of configurations of graphene nanotube structures , including nanotubes with fullerine caps .",

    "the fact that the coined discrete time quantum walk model exhibits faster transport than a simple line may be a discrete time counterpart of the continuous time effects which allow for ballistic transport on real world carbon nanotubes @xcite .    the behaviour on these materials can be traced back to the massless behaviour of electrons at the dirac point in the graphene bandstructure @xcite . on the other hand , a discrete time random walk",
    "does not carry with it an inherent notion of momentum or energy , so a band structure can not be defined . in future work",

    "in contrast , theoretical results for electrons in carbon nanotubes show that zig - zag nanotubes behave as semiconductors , while armchair nanotubes behave as metals @xcite .",
    "therefore in this respect , the relative transport efficiency between these structures for discrete time random walks are qualitatively different from what is seen in electron transport .",
    "we further see that for capped nanotube structures the arrival probability for a zig - zag nanotube always approaches unity , while it does not for the armchair , again indicating better transport for the zig - zag structures .",
    "it would be interesting in future work to examine which exhibits faster transport for continuous time quantum walks with the same starting conditions we use .",
    "on one hand , such walks would be subject to the bandstructure of the continuous material , but would be strongly out of equilibrium , unlike the cases typically examined in electronic transport calculations",
