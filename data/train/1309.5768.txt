    "the elastic wave equation governs the propagation of seismic waves resulting from earthquakes and other seismic events .",
    "other applications include waves in plates , beams and solid material structures . in the general setting the media can be described by piecewise smooth functions with jump discontinuities .",
    "this is especially true in seismological problems due to the layered structure of the earth .",
    "large contrasts in media parameters may also be found in solid mechanics devices composed of different materials in welded contact .",
    "the presence of material discontinuities gives rise to reflection and refraction phenomena .",
    "for example earlier than expected arrivals of seismic waves , so called refraction arrivals , have been shown to exist in the presence of a material discontinuity @xcite .",
    "similar to the rayleigh surface wave @xcite an analogous stoneley interface wave may under certain circumstances travel along media interfaces @xcite .",
    "also , as in the case of the traction free boundary a distinguishing characteristic of wave - interface interaction is that mode conversion occurs .",
    "that is , an incident wave type , either pressure or shear , is converted into two wave types , pressure and shear on reflection and refraction @xcite , pp 377 - 380 . in this paper , we consider the following problem : two elastic 2 dimensional half - planes are in contact at a line interface .",
    "we seek an approximation of the displacement field due to an initial disturbance as a function of time .",
    "we are particularly interested in the numerical simulation of the phenomena which arise from the influence of the line interface .",
    "to arrive at a solution to the problem we construct finite difference approximations of the elastic wave equation .",
    "the finite difference method has proven to be an efficient and easy to implement technique to approximate the elastic wave equation .",
    "however , the presence of jump discontinuities in media parameters makes the design of stable and accurate numerical methods challenging .",
    "it has been shown that smoothing or ignoring the material discontinuities in a numerical approximation reduces the formal order of accuracy to one @xcite .",
    "that is , in order to preserve high order accuracy interfaces of jump discontinuities must be given special treatment .",
    "when using finite differences for simulation of wave propagation problems it has been known for a long time that high order methods ( higher than 2 ) are superior to lower order methods @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that stability together with accuracy guaranties convergence of the numerical scheme @xcite , pp 170 .",
    "therefor a minimal requirement of the numerical scheme is high order accuracy and stability .    to arrive at the approximate solution we use summation - by - parts ( sbp ) finite difference operators @xcite to approximate spatial derivatives . to maintain high accuracy in the presence of material discontinuities the required conditions at media interfaces",
    "are enforced with the simultaneous - approximation - term ( sat ) methodology @xcite .",
    "the elastic wave equation contains both second derivative terms such as @xmath0 and mixed derivative terms like @xmath1 , where @xmath2 . to discretize these terms approximations of both first and second derivatives",
    "are required .",
    "then certain compatibility conditions of the two approximations needs to be fullfilled .",
    "we use sbp approximations of first and second derivatives that are either compatible or fully compatible , the definitions will become clear in section [ sec : s3 ] .",
    "this results in the case of fully compatible operators in a scheme which is proved to be stable in the sense that the corresponding approximative solution is bounded in a semi - norm by initial data .",
    "stability in the case of compatible sbp operators is investigated by numerical experiments .",
    "the experiments indicate stability also in this case .    discretizing",
    "the elastic wave equation has been done in several previous works .",
    "benchmark problems which includes liquid - solid interfaces was considered in @xcite .",
    "there material interfaces were not specified by any numerical boundary conditions . in @xcite",
    "the equations were rewritten to a first order system ( 1st order velocity - stress formulation ) prior to discretizing .",
    "however , stability could only be shown for homogeneous materials .",
    "a recent and promising strategy includes the use of ghost points to enforce the correct conditions at the interface is described in @xcite . in that paper focus was put on the stable treatment of hanging nodes in a grid refinement and correct discretization of singular sources .",
    "typical features of a discontinuous media was only considered in one experiment where a finite layer was put on top of a infinite half - space . in that experiment",
    "the results showed good agreement with a semi - analytical solution .",
    "the elastic wave equation with the traction free boundary condition was discretized using the sbp - sat approach in @xcite .",
    "the present study should be seen as a direct continuation of the work in @xcite .",
    "the general problem of seismic wave propagation includes non - planar boundaries . in the finite difference framework a coordinate transformation",
    "to curvilinear coordinates is therefor made before discretizing the equations .",
    "the general media might also be anisotropic .",
    "the theory in this paper is therefor presented in the general case of anisotropic media and in curvilinear coordinates . in order to focus on interface phenomena the numerical experiments are all carried out in isotropic media with piecewise constant media parameters and includes examples of mode conversion , refraction arrivals and the stoneley interface wave .",
    "however , with the theory developed the generalization to curved geometries and anisotropic media is straightforward .",
    "using an unstructured mesh greatly simplifies the handling of complicated geometries . in particular if hanging nodes are allowed .",
    "methods with this approach includes discontinuous galerkin @xcite and finite element @xcite discretizations of the elastic wave equation . generating a high quality unstructured mesh can however be a non - trivial problem in itself and also requires extra bookkeeping and additional memory to keep track of the connectivity of the grid .",
    "it would therefor be interesting to study the performance of the method proposed in this paper on problems that includes curved geometries .",
    "the rest of the paper is outlined as follows . in section [ sec : s2 ] the equations and interface conditions are introduced in the general setting .",
    "section [ sec : s3 ] introduces the necessary definitions used to describe the discretization .",
    "stability of the numerical scheme using fully compatible sbp operators is also proved here . in section",
    "[ sec : s4 ] numerical experiments are presented",
    ". the purpose of the experiments are twofold .",
    "one , to verify stability and accuracy , two , to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method on simulation of phenomena typical to wave motion in discontinuous elastic media . in particular , numerical examples of mode conversion ,",

    "<S> finite difference schemes for the simulation of elastic waves in materials with jump discontinuities are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature is the highly accurate treatment of interfaces where media discontinuities arise . </S>",
    "<S> the schemes are constructed using finite difference operators satisfying a summation - by - parts property together with a penalty technique to impose interface conditions at the material discontinuity . </S>",
    "<S> two types of operators are used , termed fully compatible or compatible . </S>",
    "<S> stability is proved for the first case by bounding the numerical solution by initial data in a suitably constructed semi - norm . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments indicate that the schemes using compatible operators are also stable . </S>",
    "<S> however , the numerical studies suggests that fully compatible operators give identical or better convergence and accuracy properties . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical experiments are also constructed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method to simulations involving typical interface phenomena in elastic materials . </S>"
