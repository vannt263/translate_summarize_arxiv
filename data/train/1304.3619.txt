    "most recent studies dealing with the magnetic structure of the solar corona above active regions use different force - free model approaches ( see recent review of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and base the modeling on photospheric vector magnetic field data from either the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) on board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) or the spectropolarimeter ( sp ) of the solar optical telescope ( sot ) on board the hinode spacecraft .",
    "such model approaches are used to compensate the lack of routine direct measurements of the coronal magnetic field vector .",
    "@xcite used sp data as lower boundary condition to an optimization approach to analyze the coronal magnetic field associated to a white light flare .",
    "the modeling suggested that the flare originated from sheared and twisted field lines with low altitudes bridged by a set of higher magnetic field lines .",
    "@xcite applied a mhd relaxation method based on sp data to investigate the buildup and release of magnetic twist and suspected the importance of the relative handedness of twisted field lines and the ambient field .",
    "@xcite employed an optimization method based on hmi data to model the temporal evolution of the coronal field of an active region over five days .",
    "the modeling displayed distinct stages of the build - up and release of magnetic energy and analyzed the association to changes in the magnetic field .",
    "in a subsequent study , @xcite used the same method for a detailed analysis of the field topology during a series of eruptions observed from hmi . above the apexes of cusp - like loops observed in coronal images , the modeling result suggested the presence of a coronal null point .",
    "comparisons of the outcome of _ different _ force - free model algorithms based on the _ same _ lower boundary conditions have been performed in the past too ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies revealed that order - of - magnitude estimates of these models based on large enough fields - of - view and high enough spatial resolution of the vector magnetic field data can be expected to be reliable .",
    "the model outcome of the _ same _ reconstruction algorithm based on data from _ different _ instruments has been studied recently by @xcite , using data from hmi and the vector - spectromagnetograph ( vsm ) of the solis project @xcite .",
    "they found agreements of the resulting force - free models in form of , e.g. , the relative amount of energy to be set free during an eruption but also found a considerable difference in the absolute model energy estimates .",
    "in particular , they found the estimated energy content of the vsm model being about twice of that of the hmi model .    in the present study we use vector magnetic field data of hmi and sp as an input to the same force - free model and",
    "compare the results .",
    "this is motivated due to the data of these two instruments being widely used recently and in the future expected to be frequently used as an input for the modeling of the coronal magnetic field .",
    "we regard this as important in order to test the consistency of the model solutions and at the same time to give a feeling about the accuracy of the estimated physical quantities and magnetic field topology based on those models .",
    "we also investigate the effect which a binning of the sp instrument data to a lower resolution has on the model outcome .",
    "we , however , do not search for explanations of the differences of the hmi and sp inversion products itself , considering this as to be out of the scope of this study .",
    "the hmi on board sdo @xcite obtains filtergrams at the photospheric fe 617.3 nm spectral line .",
    "the full stokes vector is retrieved from filtergrams averaged over about 12 min and inverted using the milne - eddington ( me ) inversion algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the 180@xmath0-azimuth ambiguity of the transverse field is resolved using a minimum energy algorithm @xcite and the resulting vector magnetograms have a plate scale of 0.5  arc - second .    in its fast scan mode ,",
    "sp as part of the sot @xcite on board the hinode spacecraft @xcite obeys a spatial resolution of @xmath10.32  arc - second .",
    "it observes the fe spectral line couplet at 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm .",
    "full stokes profiles are obtained with a spectral sampling of 2.25@xmath2 nm and a slit scan time of 1.6s .",
    "the physical parameters from the full stokes profiles were obtained using the merlin me inversion algorithm @xcite .",
    "the 180@xmath0-azimuth ambiguity is resolved in the same way as for hmi data .      to perform a study as described above simultaneous observations from hmi and sp are required .",
    "both , hmi and sp vector magnetic field data are available to analyze the magnetic structure of active region  11382 on 2011 december 22 .",
    "sp scanned this active region from 04:46  ut to 05:29  ut ( i.e. , scanned @xmath1@xmath3/min from solar east to west ) .",
    "the hmi vector map used for this study was retrieved at @xmath4@xmath505:00  ut , approximately at half of the scanning time of sp . given average photospheric conditions ( @xmath6@xmath1@xmath7 , @xmath8@xmath1@xmath9@xmath10 ) the alfvn speed is @xmath11@xmath110kms@xmath12 .",
    "the alfvn travel time and thus the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field over a characteristic distance in the present study ( @xmath1@xmath13 ) is @xmath11h .",
    "therefore , we assume that the temporal changes of the photospheric field over @xmath120  min , during which sp scanned before and after the time when hmi recorded , are negligible . regarding the longitudinal magnetic field we assume this as justified since , e.g. , also @xcite found that the average ratio of the longitudinal magnetic flux densities measured by sp and soho / mdi @xcite was not strongly influenced by the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field during the scanning time of sp .",
    "the magnetic field vectors are transformed to heliographic coordinates @xcite .",
    "we correct the sp data set for the effect of differential rotation where we use @xmath4 as reference time . given present computational capabilities high - resolution data is sometimes binned to a lower resolution in order to allow for near real - time magnetic field modeling and/or computational domains of feasible dimensions ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in the course of co - alignment of the hmi and sp data , we also bin the original - resolution sp ( sp@xmath14 ) data to the resolution of hmi which involves a 2d linear interpolation . the binned sp data is hereafter denoted as sp@xmath15 data .",
    "the field - of - view ( fov ) used to study active region  11382 is mainly determined by the area covered by the sp scan ( @xmath1140@xmath1685@xmath17 centered around s19w07 ; see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) . within the hmi data which covers roughly @xmath1400@xmath16250@xmath17",
    ", we define a window equally sized as the fov of sp and calculate the cross - correlation between its vertical field component and that of the sp data . by shifting the position of the hmi window we search for the highest cross - correlation to find the corresponding hmi sub - field",

    "the average uncertainty for both the longitudinal and transverse field , estimated from the sp inversion error maps is @xmath25@xmath23 . besides seeming rather low especially for the transverse field these standard error estimates may not be reliable ( b.  lites , private communication )",
    "thus , we employ a consistent measure of the uncertainty level for the data from the two instruments , as described in the following .    when investigating the properties of the hmi and sp data in the course of the force - free modeling , we only consider ( ) pixels with values of the vertical field , @xmath19 , _ and _ horizontal field , @xmath26 , above the respective 2@xmath22 uncertainty levels ( 2@xmath27 and 2@xmath28 , respectively ) or ( ) pixels with values of @xmath19@xmath292@xmath27 _ and _ @xmath26@xmath302@xmath28 , the latter in order not to disregard the strong vertical fields in the center of the active region .",
    "the respective 2@xmath22 uncertainty levels are calculated for the quiet - sun area , outlined by the dashed rectangles in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , where we find : 2@xmath27@xmath53.3/6.7@xmath31 and 2@xmath28@xmath55.2/12.2@xmath31 for the hmi / sp@xmath15 data .",

    "*      photospheric polarization signals originate from atmospheric layers which are known not to be force - free .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed , using vector magnetic field measurements of an active - region magnetic field , that it can be considered as to be force - free above 0.4  mm above a photospheric level .",

    "200  mm . using high - resolution sp vector maps",
    ", @xcite found that umbral and inner penumbral parts of sunspots may nearly be force - free but that sunspots as a whole at a photospheric level might not entirely be so .",

    "the binning causes a decrease of @xmath36 by @xmath13% ( see table  [ tab : forces ] ) .",
    "it also causes an increase of @xmath97 by @xmath16% .",
    "the force - freeness remains basically the same , as do the relative occurrence of the vertical / horizontal field ( figure  [ fig : fig7]a / b ) and the respective power distributions ( figure  [ fig : fig7]c / d ) remain similar . now it is also evident that the binning is only to a minor degree responsible for the differences between the sp@xmath15 and hmi data .",
    "this agrees with , e.g. , @xcite who found that the scaling the data to a lower resolution does not significantly alter the results of their particular analysis .",
    "the hmi data hosts @xmath153% of @xmath98 and @xmath186% of @xmath97 ( see table  [ tab : forces ] ) . naively , one would suspect that the difference in @xmath36 arises from the different resolution limits of the two instruments , i.e. , that the magnetic field is partially on scales which hmi can not resolve . in context with the relative occurrence of @xmath36 discussed in @xcite , however ,",
    "this can not be concluded since it was found that hmi vertical fields are on overall weaker than those of vsm data ( which with a plate - scale of @xmath11  arc - second has a _ lower _ resolution than hmi ) .",
    "therefore , the different occurrence rates must have reasons besides the different resolution limit of the instruments .",
    "preprocessing the sp@xmath14 data leads to a decrease of @xmath98 by @xmath13% and and increase of @xmath97 by @xmath140% , which is comparable to the changes of the sp@xmath15 data due to preprocessing .",
    "the modification to the sp@xmath14 lower boundary data during solving for the force- and divergence - free field , as listed in table  [ tab : forces ] , is that @xmath98 decreases by @xmath13% and @xmath97 increases by @xmath351% .",
    "summarizing , we find a similar behavior of the modifications to the sp@xmath14 data during the force - free modeling and very similar values as we found for the sp@xmath15 data ( compare the values listed in table  [ tab : forces ] ) .",
    "the potential energy of the sp@xmath15 model is @xmath11% lower and the total energy is @xmath12% higher than that of the sp@xmath14 model ( see table  [ tab : energies ] ) .",
    "hence , when basing the analysis on the sp@xmath15 data , we find and enhancement / reduction of the absolute energy estimates @xmath61/@xmath60 on the order of the statistical error of the energy estimates itself .",
    "the excess energy , @xmath62 , is enhanced by @xmath110% , i.e. , also on the order of the statistical error .",
    "the _ relative _ amount of @xmath62 , however , remains approximately the same .",
    "repeating the analysis of the magnetic connectivity within the sp@xmath14 model , we find that in total 228 magnetic field lines originating from locations of @xmath68@xmath29100 within the roi in figure  [ fig : fig8]a connect back to the lower boundary ( see figure  [ fig : fig8]b , c ) .",
    "again , we assume that those represent thin flux tubes with a cross section of @xmath78@xmath1220@xmath79@xmath80 and assume the vertical field at footpoint from which we started the field line calculation determines its flux .",
    "summation over the all considered thin flux tubes gives an estimated total shared flux of @xmath81@xmath5@xmath99@xmath16@xmath84 which comprises about 1% of the unsigned vertical flux of the nlff lower boundary of the sp@xmath14 model .",
    "this is almost identical to what was found for the model based on the sp@xmath15 data , as is the connectivity pattern ( compare figures[fig : fig9 ] and [ fig : fig5]b ) . considering all field lines starting from a pixel location on the nlff bottom boundary in the range @xmath77@xmath30@xmath73 where @xmath19@xmath292@xmath27 _ and _ @xmath26,@xmath292@xmath28 or @xmath19@xmath292@xmath27 _ and _ @xmath26@xmath302@xmath28",

    "non - identical photospheric vector magnetic fields inferred from polarization measurements of different instruments used as input for nonlinear force - free ( nlff ) coronal magnetic field models directly translate to substantial differences in the model outcome . to quantify these , we performed force - free magnetic field modeling using active - region vector magnetic field data based on measurements of polarization signals by the sdo / hmi and hinode sot / sp . the possible causes of the differences of the data products itself , including the , e.g. , different intrinsic nature and sensitivity of the instruments , the temporal evolution of the photospheric magnetic field during the ongoing scanning times or the inversion techniques used to infer the magnetic field vector from the measured polarization signals , were out of the scope of this work .",
    "our aim was to compare force - free model results based on data from these two instruments so we applied all data preparation and modeling routines in exactly the same way to both data sets .",
    "force - free coronal magnetic field modeling is computationally expensive and high - resolution data is sometimes binned to a lower resolution in order to shorten the computational time .",
    "we , therefore , binned the original - resolution sp ( sp@xmath14 ) data to the resolution of hmi which allowed us , besides ( ) to quantify the deviations of the force - free modeling outcome due to the usage of data of _ different _ instruments ( hmi and sp ) , also ( ) to investigate the effect of binning the input data to a lower resolution on the model outcome , by subsequent comparison of the models based on the binned sp ( sp@xmath15 ) data and sp@xmath14 data .",
    "we did not intend to mimic the different spatial resolution of the instruments by binning of the vector data since , as pointed out by @xcite , any kind of binning does not account properly for resolution effects . instead , in practice , a binning of high - resolution data prior to the nlff modeling is meant to result in feasible computational dimensions and to allow for near real - time modeling .",
    "we used hmi and sp vector maps of active region  11382 on 2011 december 22 and found considerably higher vertical magnetic flux and average horizontal field in the sp data .",
    "this difference of the vertical flux was found to be much larger than the modifications to the data due to application of our force - free modeling routines . also",
    "the modifications to the vertical flux due to binning of the sp@xmath14 data to the resolution of hmi were found to be small compared to the inequality of detected flux by the two instruments .",
    "unequal estimates of the magnitude and orientation of longitudinal and transverse fields based on the inversion of circular and linear polarization signals measured by the two different instruments , yield differing estimates of the vertical and horizontal magnetic field in a local coordinate system .",
    "the unequal amount of vertical magnetic flux ( the projected sp data hosting about two times the unsigned vertical flux of hmi ) then directly translates to a considerable discrepancy in the _ absolute _ estimates of the energy content of the considered coronal volume : models based on the sp data hold about twice as much energy as does the hmi model . by tracing magnetic field lines in the half - space above the model",
    "lower boundaries their connectivity was investigated .",
    "the sp and sp@xmath14 models revealed a closely matching photospheric footprint of two neighboring coronal connectivity domains .",
    "a similar footprint was found in the hmi model but locally shifted by up to several@xmath69 .",
    "the same applies to the locations where field lines re - enter the nlff lower boundary : while the location of the footpoints of the sp and sp@xmath14 models coincide , those of the hmi model are displaced by up to ten@xmath69 .",
    "moreover , on overall , the sp and sp@xmath14 model fields tend to be more vertical than the hmi model field which is a direct consequence of the relative vertical and horizontal field distribution given by the instrument data",
    ".    however , the models also showed great similarities : _ relative _ estimates like the fraction of energy in excess over a potential field ( about 20% of the total energy content ) or the fraction of vertical flux shared by two neighboring connectivity domains ( about 1% of the total vertical flux of the active region ) agree very well .",
    "also the overall field - line geometry was found to be comparable : the length of all closed field lines in the model volumes was found to be more or less linearly related to the apex height .",
    "common to the model outcomes is also that the shortest and lowest as well as the longest and highest field lines carry least vertical flux .    in conclusion",
    ", caution is needed when analyzing the coronal magnetic field and its connectivity with the help of force - free magnetic field models based on the vector magnetic field products of different instruments , made available to the community .",
    "_ relative _ estimates and the overall structure of the model magnetic fields might indeed be reliable while _ absolute _ estimates might only be so concerning their order of magnitude",
    ". moreover , binning of the magnetic vector data to a lower resolution prior to the force - free modeling results only in little differences in the model outcome , small compared to the remarkable deviations when basing the modeling on data from the two different instruments , hmi and sp .",
