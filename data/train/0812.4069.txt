    "some versions of the grbner bases machinery were introduced for various algebraic structures by several authors ( shirshov  @xcite for lie algebras , buchberger  @xcite for commutative algebras , and bergman  @xcite and bokut  @xcite for associative algebras ) .",
    "they proved to be extremely useful for studying various types of algebras defined by generators and relations .",
    "if one knows a grbner basis for relations that define a graded algebra  @xmath0 , it can be used to compute dimensions of the graded components  @xmath1 , find out whether or not two elements of @xmath0 are equal to each other etc .  in the most efficient algorithmic way .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop the machinery of grbner bases for ideals in free operads .    for nonsymmetric operads ( that is , planar tree - shaped structures )",
    "some versions of grbner bases already appeared in literature , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "when one tries to define grbner bases for symmetric operads , there are two serious issues to address , both existing due to the symmetric groups action on components .",
    "first of all , the usual approach to grbner bases suggests that they are defined for ideals of free monoids in a certain monoidal category , and the definition requires a `` monomial '' basis of the free monoid together with an ordering of this basis which is reasonably compatible with the monoidal product .",
    "if we are working with operads , the monoidal product is given by the symmetric composition , and there is no known choice of an ordered basis for the free operad for which the ordering is compatible with products .",
    "also , for the case of associative algebras a very important feature of grbner bases is that for every algebra they produce a monomial algebra ( that is , an algebra whose defining relations are monomial ; these algebras are usually much easier to handle than the generic ones ) with the same graded dimensions and monomial basis as the original one .",
    "for the case of symmetric operads , it is impossible to do such a thing : together with every vanishing monomial its orbit under the symmetric group action should vanish , and the resulting operad will be too small ( to make this reasoning precise , we suggest to the reader to look at the example of the operad  @xmath2 ) .",
    "the crucial idea that allows to overcome the difficulties is to change the viewpoint on symmetric operads .",
    "namely , we introduce a new monoidal structure on collections , which is different from the one used in the definition of an operad .",
    "we call this monoidal structure the shuffle composition of collections , and a monoid in the corresponding category   a shuffle operad .",
    "the word `` shuffle '' here reflects the combinatorics of compositions in this category ; these compositions previously were somewhat implicitly used in many papers , since they provide a natural choice when computing something in an `` operad with a fixed basis '' .",
    "for example , combinatorial objects very close to our `` shuffle surjections '' are discussed in  ( * ? ? ? * prop .",
    "11.6 ) , and `` elementary shuffle compositions '' are defined in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) ( where they are called `` pointed shuffles '' ) ; see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.2 ) , where elementary shuffle compositions appear naturally from the geometry of face complexes for compactified configuration spaces .",
    "shuffle operads interpolate between symmetric and nonsymmetric operads ; they are no longer equipped with symmetric groups actions , but possible operadic compositions are not restricted to the nonsymmetric ones .",
    "the main feature of shuffle operads is that the free shuffle operad generated by a symmetric collection can be naturally identified with the free symmetric operad generated by the same collection .",
    "this means that we can make all necessary computations in the shuffle category , and use them to prove theorems in the symmetric category .    using our methods",
    ", we define all necessary notions ( orderings , reductions , @xmath3-polynomials ) and prove an operadic analogue of bergman s diamond lemma  @xcite .",
    "this results in an analogue of buchberger s",
    "algorithm  @xcite for computing grbner bases .",
    "one of applications of grbner basis for algebras is that they give an effective version of priddy s pbw criterion of koszulness for quadratic algebras  @xcite .",
    "our version of grbner bases for operads provides , in a similar fashion , an effective algorithmic criterion of hoffbeck s pbw criterion of koszulness for quadratic operads  @xcite .      in section  [ opsummary ] , we discuss collections and three different monoidal structures on collections , leading to three different kinds of operads : nonsymmetric operads , symmetric operads , and shuffle operads .",
    "we discuss the relationship between different kinds of operads .    in section  [ grobner ] , we discuss combinatorics of free operads : a basis consisting of decorated trees ( `` tree monomials '' ) , divisibility for monomials in free operads , reductions , @xmath3-polynomials , and grbner bases ; furthermore , we present analogues of bergman s diamond lemma and buchberger s algorithm for computing a grbner basis . for quadratic operads",
    ", we relate our results to hoffbeck s theory of pbw operads  @xcite .    in section  [ examples ]",
    ", we show that for some well known operads their defining ideals have quadratic grbner bases , and present a construction which assigns a pbw operad to each graded commutative pbw algebra .",
    "we use this construction to prove koszulness for some operads .    in section",
    "[ further ] , we discuss some possible further directions of this work , including our work in progress .",
    "the authors wish to thank eric hoffbeck for clarifying some details of  @xcite and henrik strohmayer for some useful remarks on a preliminary version of this paper .",
    "they are also grateful to giovanni felder , muriel livernet , sergei merkulov , dmitri piontkovsky , leonid positselski and ivan yudin for several useful discussions .",
    "all vector spaces throughout this work are defined over an arbitrary field  @xmath4 of zero characteristic .",
    "we denote by  @xmath5 the category of nonempty finite ordered sets ( with order - preserving bijections as morphisms ) , and by @xmath6   the category of nonempty finite sets ( with bijections as morphisms ) .",
    "also , we denote by @xmath7 the category of vector spaces ( with linear operators as morphisms ; unlike the first two cases , we do not require a map to be invertible ) .",
    "1 .   a _ ( nonsymmetric ) collection _ is a contravariant functor from the category  @xmath5 to the category  @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   a _ symmetric collection _ ( or a _ @xmath8-module _ )",
    "is a contravariant functor from the category  @xmath6 to the category  @xmath7 .    for either type of collections",
    ", we can consider the category whose objects are collections of this type ( and morphisms are morphisms of the corresponding functors ) .    1 .",
    "a nonsymmetric collection is nothing but a positively graded vector space .",
    "however , the functorial definition will help us to give transparent definitions of monoidal structures which are otherwise ( from the graded vector spaces viewpoint ) totally mysterious .",
    "2 .   let @xmath9 be a symmetric collection .",
    "then for each finite set  @xmath10 the vector space  @xmath11 is naturally a representation of the group  @xmath12 . in particular , for the `` standard '' @xmath13-element set @xmath14=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] the vector space @xmath15)$ ] is a right @xmath16-module for each  @xmath17 .",
    "this explains the name  @xmath8-module .",
    "the functoriality implies that it is possible to reconstruct ( in either the symmetric or the nonsymmetric case ) all vector spaces @xmath11 from the sequence of vector spaces @xmath18)$ ] .",
    "thus , the word `` collection '' is often used for this data .",
    "4 .   the natural forgetful functor @xmath19",
    ", @xmath20 leads to a forgetful functor @xmath21 from the category of symmetric collections to the category of nonsymmetric ones ( which literally forgets the action of the groups of symmetries ) : @xmath22 5 .",
    "all these definitions can be given also in the case when the target category is , say , a refinement of  @xmath7 , for example , the category of graded vector spaces , or dg - vector spaces ( chain complexes ) .",
    "now we are going to define the main ingredients used in the operad theory : monoidal structures on our categories .",
    "the first and the third one ( nonsymmetric and symmetric compositions in the corresponding categories ) are well known , the second one ( the shuffle composition in the nonsymmetric category ) is new .",
    "it provides a reasonable interpolation between the first two .",

    "the following proposition is straightforward ; we omit the proof .",
    "each of the compositions defined above endows the underlying category with a structure of a strict monoidal category .",
    "the unit object in each case is the functor @xmath32 which vanishes on all sets of cardinality greater than  @xmath33 and is one - dimensional for any set of cardinality  @xmath33 .    1 .",

    "a _ symmetric operad _ is a monoid in the category of symmetric collections with the monoidal structure given by the ( symmetric ) composition .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for standard background information on symmetric operads .",
    "note that our monoidal structures are nonlinear on the right side : the functors @xmath34 do not commute with coproducts .",
    "there is a convenient way to replace compositions by the so called elementary compositions which are linear in both arguments .",
    "informally , if we interpret the components @xmath35 of an operad @xmath9 as @xmath13-ary operations , the composition maps allow all possible substitutions of operations .",
    "elementary compositions are those for which for all but one argument we substitute the unit element of the operad . every composition can be described as a result of subsequent application of elementary compositions .",
    "let us describe elementary compositions more explicitly .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we do interpret elements of operads as operations , instead of writing the formal categorical definitions .",
    "the proof of the proposition is omitted , as it is an immediate consequence of our definitions .",

    "+ ( the word `` shuffle '' reflects the way @xmath48 permutes the elements : the relative order of the elements @xmath49 is preserved , as well as the relative order of the elements @xmath50 . )",
    "the symmetric composition @xmath42 is the operation @xmath51 here @xmath52 is an arbitrary permutation .    for each of the three monoidal structures that we consider , one can define free monoids and ( left , right , two - sided ) ideals of a monoid within the general categorical framework (",
    "a small remark is that the categorical approach to these notions should be handled with care , since our monoidal structures do not commute with coproducts ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "however , the categorical approach has to be translated into a working definition ; further in this text we shall give an explicit construction for a free operad with given generators .",
    "the main relation between our monoidal structures is described by the following    [ sym - shuffle ] consider two symmetric collections @xmath9 and @xmath23 .",
    "then we have @xmath53 in other words , the forgetful functor is a monoidal functor between the symmetric and the shuffle category of collections .",

    "what makes a difference is the tensor product over symmetric groups , and different conditions on surjections over which the direct sum is taken .",
    "it turns out that we can cover both differences simultaneously : to get rid of the symmetric group @xmath55 , it is sufficient to fix some way to order tensor factors in the product @xmath56 , which can be , for example , done by introducing the condition @xmath57 which is precisely the shuffling surjection condition .",
    "there are two standard ways to define operads : via generators and relations , and via representations . both definitions are useful , and we present them here . basically , the definition via generators and relations is helpful if one wants to work inside a larger object ( the free operad ) , and the definition via representations ( algebras over operads ) is commonly used to write down definitions and proofs , since it does not require any complicated drawings , just usual compositions of operations .",

    "this leads naturally to the following idea .",
    "assume that we wish to study a symmetric operad defined by generators and relations .",
    "as a shuffle operad , this operad is isomorphic to the operad defined by the same generators and relations in the shuffle category .",
    "thus , if we have any efficient algorithms for working with quotients ( computing bases , dimensions etc . ) for shuffle operads , we can apply them , and then automatically extend the obtained results to the symmetric case .",
    "in the case of associative algebras , to define grbner bases , one needs a monomial basis of the free algebra , and an ordering of monomials which is compatible with the product . in the case of operads , for a monomial basis one",
    "usually takes some class of decorated trees .",
    "products are replaced by operadic compositions , which , in the symmetric case , include the action of symmetric groups on the components . to come up with a working definition of grbner bases ,",
    "it is important to know that the monoidal structure ( compositions , in our case ) are reasonably compatible with the ordering of monomials . instead of looking for a suitable",
    "ordered basis , we shall work with shuffle operads ; according to corollary  [ freeop ] , we are not going to lose information about operadic ideals and quotients this way , in the case when our shuffle operads come from symmetric operads .",
    "thus , we only need the compatibility with shuffle compositions .",
    "it turns out that for shuffle compositions there exist many different ways to define a compatible ordering .",
    "we shall present two of them here .    throughout this section ,",
    "the word `` operad '' means a shuffle operad .",
    "it is well known that it is convenient to represent elements of the free operad by ( decorated ) trees .",
    "a ( rooted ) _ tree _ is a non - empty connected directed graph @xmath87 of genus  @xmath88 for which each vertex has at least one incoming edge and exactly one outgoing edge .",

    "such edges are called _ external_. each tree should have exactly one outgoing external edge , its _",

    "the endpoints of ingoing external edges which are not vertices of our tree are called _",
    "leaves_.    each tree with  @xmath13 leaves should be labelled by  @xmath14 $ ] ; throughout the paper , we assume all labellings to be bijective . for each vertex @xmath89 of a tree",
    ", the edges going in and out of @xmath89 will be referred to as inputs and outputs at  @xmath89 . a tree with a single vertex",
    "is called a _",
    "corolla_. there is also a tree with a single input and no vertices called the _ degenerate _ tree .",
    "trees are originally considered as abstract graphs but to work with them we would need some particular representatives that we now going to describe .    for a tree with labelled leaves ,",
    "its canonical planar representative is defined as follows .",
    "in general , an embedding of a ( rooted ) tree in the plane is determined by an ordering of inputs for each vertex . to compare two inputs of a vertex  @xmath89",
    ", we find the minimal leaves that one can reach from  @xmath89 via the corresponding input .",
    "the input for which the minimal leaf is smaller is considered to be less than the other one .",
    "note that this choice of a representative is essentially the same one as we already made when we identified symmetric compositions with shuffle compositions .",
    "let us introduce an explicit realisation of the free operad generated by a collection @xmath58 .",
    "the basis of this operad will be indexed by planar representative of trees with decorations of all vertices .",
    "first of all , the simplest possible tree is the degenerate tree ; it corresponds to the unit of our operad .",
    "the second simplest type of trees is given by corollas .",
    "we shall fix a basis  @xmath90 of @xmath58 and decorate the vertex of each corolla with a basis element ; for a corolla with @xmath13 inputs , the corresponding element should belong to the basis of  @xmath91 .",
    "the basis for whole free operad consists of all planar representatives of trees built from these corollas ( explicitly , one starts with this collection of corollas , defines compositions of trees in terms of grafting , and then considers all trees obtained from corollas by iterated shuffle compositions ) .",
    "we shall refer to elements of this basis as _",
    "tree monomials_.    [ basis ] let @xmath92 be the free operad for which the only nonzero component of @xmath58 is @xmath68 , and the basis of @xmath68 is given by @xmath93{y1.1.eps}\\ ] ] then the basis of @xmath94 is given by the tree monomials @xmath93{basis.1.eps}\\ ] ] with @xmath95 .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath96 corolla corresponds to the operation @xmath97 , then the above tree monomials correspond to operations @xmath98 respectively ( as we mentioned before , this notation is much more compact than that tree notation ) .",
    "the free operad has two gradings that add up under compositions of operations : the arity degree , which for a tree monomial is one less than the number of leaves of the underlying tree , and the operation degree , which for a tree monomial is equal to the number of vertices of the underlying tree .",
    "an element of the free operad is said to be _ homogeneous _ if all tree monomials that occur in this element with nonzero coefficients have the same arity degree ( but not necessarily the same operation degree ) .",
    "an ordering of tree monomials of @xmath99 is said to be _ admissible _ , if the following properties are satisfied :    * if @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , then @xmath103 . *",

    "the composition on the level of permutations preserves all entries of the first permutation that are less than  @xmath112 , substitutes instead of  @xmath112 the second permutation increased ( termwise ) by @xmath126 , and increases all other entries by @xmath127 .",

    "currently , we do not know whether grbner bases machinery for properads and props can be defined in a similar fashion .",
    "shuffle operads can be used for questions of homological algebra as well : for a symmetric operad , its symmetric ( co)bar construction coincides with its shuffle ( co)bar construction , so we can compute its cohomology using the shuffle category .",
    "it turns out that in that category one can use a grbner basis to construct a remarkable free resolution of the trivial module .",
    "we shall describe it in our next paper .",
    "our analogue of buchberger s algorithm should be interpreted as a call for a computer algebra system that would compute grbner bases for operads presented by generators and relations , and use those bases to compute dimensions of graded components , normal forms of elements etc .",
