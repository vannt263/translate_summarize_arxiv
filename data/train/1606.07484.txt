    "pulsar timing arrays ( ptas @xcite ) are designed to detect the low - frequency ( @xmath1nhz ) gravitational wave ( gw ) background that would be generated by a population of binary supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) . in the simplest model",

    "i.e. @xmath16 pc , a massive binary is expected to evolve primarily via interactions with ambient stars and gas in the galactic nucleus rather than by gw emission @xcite .",
    "furthermore there is no compelling reason why binaries at these large separations should be on circular orbits ; it is only at smaller separations that gw emission becomes effective at reducing eccentricities .",

    "_ binary hardening rates",
    ". _ the `` final - parsec problem '' @xcite refers to the possibility that massive binaries might stall at separations much greater than required for the emission of detectable gws . here",
    "we make use of recent work @xcite which shows that even in `` collisionless '' ( gas - free , long - relaxation - time ) nuclei , like those of massive galaxies , a modest departure from exact axisymmetry is sufficient to keep a massive binary shrinking . in such a nucleus",
    ", the binary hardening rate decreases with time , but interactions with stars are nevertheless able to drive the binary to coalescence on a timescale of order 1 gyr or less . in an accurately axisymmetric nucleus ,",
    "hardening rates are low enough that coalescence is not likely in a hubble time , but a binary can still enter into the pta frequency regime . guided by the observations , we characterize high - luminosity bulges as triaxial and low - luminosity bulges as axisymmetric , then use the expressions derived in the cited papers to compute binary hardening rates for the different galaxy populations .",
    "_ eccentricity evolution .",
    "_ in the regime where binary hardening is driven by interaction with stars , as opposed to gw emission , eccentricity evolution has been shown to be modest , at least in spherical nonrotating nuclei @xcite . on this basis , most discussion of the stochastic gw spectrum have assumed zero eccentricities .",
    "the situation can be very different in the case of nuclei with significant rotation , particularly if the angular momentum of the massive binary is initially misaligned with that of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "given such initial conditions , the binary s orbital plane rotates to bring its angular momentum vector more in alignment with the nuclear rotation axis , and the binary s eccentricity simultaneously increases , sometimes to very large values ( @xmath0 ) .",

    "a value @xmath32 hz was required , substantially larger than the value expected physically unless nuclear densities in giant galaxies exceed @xmath33 .",
    "this possibility was judged unlikely by arzoumanian et al . , and those authors suggested that the mop prior might be in error ( too large ) , either because binary  typically stall at separations outside the pta band , or because the characterization adopted by mop for the parent population of  was somehow incorrect .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion .",
    "we argue in fact that both s13 and mop substantially overestimated the mean ratio of  mass to bulge mass .",
    "a more conservative ( in the sense of being based on more compelling data ) estimate of this ratio is @xmath34 which is the fiducial value we adopt here .",
    "the last of these assumptions is most important at setting the predicted amplitude of @xmath28 at frequencies that lie in the current range of pta sensitivity .",
    "our models have @xmath35 , a factor of at least two lower than in most other recent calculations of @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "3 .   merger timescales depend on gas fraction : for equal - mass mergers , they become considerably shorter when gas fractions are high @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the disk galaxies having higher gas fractions are harder to deblend at close separations , which reduces the time interval over which two galaxies can be observed as a close pair .",

    "4 .   the hydrodynamical simulations of lotz et al . give a significantly lower merger timescale estimate than the semi - analytical model of @xcite , who used a mock galaxy catalog derived from the millennium simulation .",
    "kitzbichler & white assume that the secondary galaxy moves in a circular orbit inside the constant potential of the primary , and this is probably not a good approximation for close pairs of nearly equal mass .",

    "we have presented calculations of the isotropic gravitational wave ( gw ) background spectrum that would be produced by a population of binary supermassive black holes ( ) in galactic nuclei . in our model ,",
    "massive binaries evolve at large separations due to interaction with their stellar environment and at small separations due to emission of gws .",
    "new features of our calculation , and the major results , are summarized here .    1 .",
    "we model the time dependence of the binary hardening rate , @xmath226 , using the results of @xcite who derived expressions for @xmath227 that are valid in the large-@xmath59 ( collisionless ) limit appropriate to giant galaxies .",
    "these expressions imply efficient coalescence for binaries at the centers of triaxial ( i.e. non - axisymmetric ) galaxies , like those that are expected to form in galaxy mergers . in the case of axisymmetric geometries",
    " which may be a better representation of low - luminosity galaxies  binary hardening rates are predicted to be lower ( fig .  [ figure : t , a , e=0]a ) , implying a dependence of coalescence timescale @xmath222 on galaxy luminosity , hence on @xmath140 .",
    "2 .   rapid evolution of binary  in triaxial galaxies significantly ( by a few orders of magnitude ) decreases gw emission at low frequencies , @xmath228 , compared with a fiducial model in which evolution is driven entirely by gw emission itself .",
    "evolution timescales are short enough in this geometry ( @xmath229 ) that essentially all binaries would reach coalescence , hence @xmath28 at high frequencies includes contributions from essentially every binary that forms , and it obeys the standard @xmath230 dependence for @xmath231 , which is approximately the current pta sensitivity range @xcite ) . in axisymmetric galaxies , binary evolution at large separations is slower .",
    "the frequency below which the @xmath232 spectrum is truncated is @xmath233 in this case ; furthermore , since @xmath222 can be longer than a hubble time for @xmath204 ( the `` final - parsec problem '' ) , there is a reduction in the contribution of these binaries to @xmath28 at high frequencies as well , lowering the predicted amplitude of @xmath28 ( however , the situation is different for highly eccentric binaries which have much lower @xmath222 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure : a_axi , e>0 ] ) .",
    "3 .   galactic nuclei are generically rotational in the sense that there is a preferred axis about which stars orbit .",
    "eccentricity evolution of a massive binary in a rotating nucleus depends strongly on its initial angular momentum direction compared with that of the nucleus @xcite . initially corotating binaries as well as",
    "some of the counterrotating ones circularize very quickly due to stellar encounters and enter the pta band while almost circular .",
    "counterrotating binaries can attain very high eccentricities ( @xmath0 ) if their angular momenta are initially strongly inclined with respect to the nucleus and in some cases will retain this high eccentricity even when entering the gw - dominated regime ( fig .",
    "[ figure : e>0 ] ) .",
    "high eccentricities imply a reduction in @xmath28 at low frequencies ; in the case of axisymmetric galaxies it also increases @xmath28 at high frequencies ( by a factor as great as @xmath128 ) because it shortens the coalescence time , allowing more binaries to enter gw emission regime and contribute to the pta signal .",
    "we argue (   [ section : mbh - mbulge ] ) that previous calculations of @xmath28 have been based on an incorrect ( over - estimated ) value of @xmath142 , the mean ratio of  mass to bulge mass .",
    "we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath234 for this ratio , compared with @xmath30 in most other studies .",
    "this lower value results in a reduction in the predicted @xmath28 at all frequencies ( since @xmath235 ) , and a shift in the peak of @xmath28 to higher frequencies ( lower - mass  enter the gw - dominated regime at higher orbital frequencies ) . we show that in the frequency regime currently accessible to ptas , @xmath236 ( eq . [ equation : a_yr(beta ) ] and fig .",
    "[ figure : t , a , e=0]b ) , so that our choice for this ratio implies a factor @xmath111 reduction in the characteristic strain .",
    "one consequence is that the existing `` tension '' between theoretical predictions of @xmath28 and observational non - detections by ptas @xcite is removed .",
    "@xcite argued that a selection bias exists such that almost all galaxies in which the  influence sphere has been resolved have velocity dispersions that are higher than average for a fixed galaxy mass .",
    "the impact of this bias on detection of gws by ptas was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "both of these studies accept at face value claims that  influence radii have been resolved .",
    "we discuss , in ",
    "[ section : mbh - mbulge ] , why this assumption is likely to be incorrect .    for the values of @xmath237 that we favor ,",
    "almost all of our models predict @xmath238 .",
    "this value of @xmath8 was identified as a `` conservative _ lower _ limit '' ( emphasis added ) by @xcite in their study of time - to - detection of the stochastic gw background by ptas .",
    "those authors considered two ways in which pta detection limits might improve over time : due to lengthened data streams for individual pulsars , and due to the addition of new pulsars .",
    "assuming an average of three new pulsars per year ( which they considered conservative ) , they estimated a probable date of first detection of gws of @xmath239 for @xmath240 , and somewhat later if red noise is present in the auto - correlations .    in our assumed  mass  bulge mass relation , and our expressions for the bulge fractions in different galaxy types , we ignored scatter , assuming the relations to be exact .",
    "as figure 9 of @xcite demonstrates , the presence of scatter in the  mass  bulge mass relation does not simply increase scatter in the computed @xmath28 or @xmath23 ; it also increases their mean values . in this sense",
    ", our results could be viewed as a lower limit on @xmath28 .",
    "even if we accept the pessimistic view that detection of the isotropic gw background by ptas may lie many years in the future , sufficiently massive or nearby systems may rise above the stochastic background signal and be individually detectable .",
    "identification of the binary s host galaxy , and detection of electromagnetic radiative processes associated with the late evolution of the binary , can assist in the extraction of the binary parameters from pta data .",
    "photometric or spectroscopic measurement of the host galaxy s cosmological redshift would provide a distance estimate , allowing a chirp mass to be derived even for a binary  that does not evolve in frequency over pta observing timescales @xcite .",
    "these `` multi - messenger '' studies may hold the greatest hope for finally establishing the  mass - to - host - mass relations .",
