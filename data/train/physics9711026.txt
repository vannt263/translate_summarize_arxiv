    "the complete @xmath0-dependence formulas for the nuclear recoil corrections to the energy levels of hydrogenlike atoms in the case of a point nucleus were first obtained by a quasipotential method [ 1 ] and subsequently rederived by different approaches [ 2 - 4 ] . according to [ 4 ] ,",
    "the nuclear size corrections to the recoil effect can be partially included in these formulas by a replacement of the pure coulomb potential with the potential of an extended nucleus . the total recoil correction for a state @xmath4 of a hydrogenlike atom is conveniently written as the sum of a low - order term @xmath5 and a higher - order term @xmath6 [ 1 ] , where ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8|a\\rangle\\,,\\\\ \\delta e_{h}&=&\\frac{i}{2\\pi m}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\omega\\ , \\langle a|\\bigl({\\bf d}(\\omega)- \\frac{[{\\bf p},v]}{\\omega+i0 } \\bigr)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times g(\\omega + \\varepsilon_{a } ) \\bigl({\\bf d}(\\omega)+\\frac{[{\\bf p},v]}{\\omega+i0}\\bigr )    unperturbed state of the dirac electron in the nuclear potential @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the momentum operator , @xmath11 is the relativistic coulomb green function , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the dirac matrices , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the transverse part of the photon propagator in the coulomb gauge : @xmath17 in equation ( 2 ) , the scalar product is implicit . for point - like nuclei , @xmath18 .",
    "if extended nuclei are considered , @xmath9 is the potential of the extended nucleus in eq .",
    "( 2 ) and in calculating @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the nuclear size corrections are completely included in the coulomb part of the recoil effect . in the one - transverse - photon part and the two - transverse - photon part ( see ref . [ 4 ] ) , they are only partially included . at least for high @xmath1",
    "we expect that this procedure accounts for the dominant part of the nuclear size effect since using the extended nucleus wave function and the extended nucleus green function strongly reduces the singularities of the integrands in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the nuclear region .",
    "the term @xmath5 contains all the recoil corrections within the @xmath22 approximation .",

    "to lowest order in @xmath0 , this term represents the salpeter correction [ 8 ] .",
    "the calculation of this term to all orders in @xmath0 was performed in [ 9,10 ] for the case of a point nucleus . according to these calculations , the recoil correction to the lamb shift of the 1s state in hydrogen",

    "this value is close to the @xmath26 correction ( 7.4 khz ) found in [ 3 ] and is clearly distinct from a recent result for the @xmath26 correction ( 16.4 khz ) obtained in [ 11 ] .",
