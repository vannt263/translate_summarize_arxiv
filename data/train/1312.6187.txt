    "in their much celebrated work @xcite , borcea and brndn characterized all linear operators which preserve geometric locations of polynomials of a single variable , thereby completing a program whose origins date back to the turn of the 20th century and the seminal paper of g. plya and j. schur @xcite .",
    "plya and schur studied sequences of real numbers @xmath1 with the property that the real polynomial @xmath2 has only real zeros whenever @xmath3 does .",
    "they named such sequences _ multiplier sequences _ of the first kind .",
    "the classification of these objects has two of its pillars ( i ) the deep understanding and careful analysis of what is now known as the laguerre - plya class of real entire functions , and ( ii ) the schur - mal - szeg composition theorem ( @xcite , @xcite ) . a natural extension to the plya - schur theory is the study of @xmath4-multiplier sequences ; that is , real sequences @xmath1 with the property that @xmath5 has only real zeros whenever @xmath6 does , where @xmath7 is an arbitrary ( fixed ) basis for @xmath8 $ ] . in a 1950 lecture @xcite ,",
    "turn already pointed out the potential usefulness of such an extension to the study of hermite multiplier sequences and their relation to the study of the riemann @xmath9-function .",
    "subsequently , turn @xcite , and later bleecker and csordas @xcite paved the way to our understanding of hermite expansions of real entire functions and hermite multiplier sequences , whose complete characterization was obtained in 2007 by piotrowski @xcite .",
    "more recently , brndn and ottergren @xcite gave the only other known characterization involving multiplier sequences , namely those for generalized laguerre bases .",
    "+ applications of borcea and brndn s main theorems require one to compute the action of a given linear operator @xmath10 \\to { \\mathbb r}[x]$ ] on various basis elements .",
    "one can accomplish this by identifying the unique coefficient polynomials @xmath11 in the representation @xmath12 whose existence is shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the following two problems thus naturally arise .",
    "[ problem1 ] given a linear operator @xmath10 \\to { \\mathbb r}[x]$ ] , find explicit expressions for the coefficient polynomials @xmath11 .",
    "[ problem2 ] identify properties of the polynomials @xmath11 which allow one to decide directly whether or not @xmath13 is reality preserving .",

    "the jensen polynomials associated to a real entire function @xmath26 ( or to its sequence of taylor coefficients ) have been studied extensively ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) , and can be used to give conditions on when @xmath26 belongs to the laguerre - plya class .",
    "it is thus encouraging that the reversed jensen polynomials should appear in the coefficient polynomials of a differential operator which is diagonal with respect to the standard basis . + in this paper",
    "we solve problem [ problem1 ] for operators which are diagonal with respect to a generalized hermite basis ( theorem [ tkthm ] ) .",
    "an appealing feature of our solution is the appearance of the reversed jensen polynomials in the formulation of the polynomials @xmath11 . in addition , the coefficients of an operator diagonal with respect to the standard basis are obtained as limits of the coefficients of hermite diagonal operators ( proposition [ hlimitstandard ] )",
    ". we also solve problem [ problem2 ] for certain hermite diagonal operators by demonstrating that the reality of the zeros of the coefficient polynomials can be used to determine whether a hermite diagonal operator is reality preserving .",
    "in particular , we show that if a hermite diagonal operator is reality preserving , then its coefficient polynomials must all have only real zeros ( theorem [ tkreal ] ) .",
    "the converse of this result is false in this much generality , but becomes true if we restrict our considerations to hermite diagonal operators associated to functions in @xmath27 with finitely many zeros ( theorem [ finitelymanyzeros ] ) .",
