    "the transition of a flexible macromolecular chain from a random - coil conformation to a globular compact form , called coil - globule transition , has been a subject of extensive theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "generally , polymers in a good solvent are modelled by random walks with short - range repulsion ( excluded volume ) .",
    "polymers undergoing a coil - globule transition are then modelled by adding an additional short - range attraction .",
    "this short - range attraction is both due to an affinity between monomers and solvent molecules , affecting the solvability of a polymer , and also due to intra - molecular interactions between different monomers , for example due to van - der - waals forces .",
    "the canonical lattice model @xcite for this transition is given by interacting self - avoiding walks , in which self - avoiding random walks on a lattice are weighted according to the number of nearest - neighbour contacts ( non - consecutively visited nearest - neighbour lattice sites ) .    it is recognised that in biological systems , _",
    "e.g. _ proteins , the most relevant contribution to monomer - monomer - interactions is due to hydrogen bonds .",
    "these hydrogen bonds can only form if neighbouring segments are aligned in a certain way , resulting in an interaction that is strongly dependent on the relative orientation of segments .",
    "this type interaction plays a leading role in the formation of secondary protein structures such as @xmath1-helices and @xmath0-sheets @xcite . in this paper , we introduce a model for controlling the type of orientational order of these structures .    in @xcite ,",
    "bascle _ et al _ introduced a lattice model of polymers interacting via hydrogen bonds , in which hydrogen bonds were mimicked by an interaction between two nearest - neighbour lattice sites which belong to two _ straight _ segments of the polymer .",
    "this was treated in the context of hamiltonian walks in a mean - field approach , and they predicted a first - order transition between an anisotropic ordered phase and a molten phase .",
    "later , foster and seno introduced this type of interaction to a model of self - avoiding walks @xcite .",
    "they analyzed it using transfer - matrix techniques in two dimensions , where a first - order transition between a folded polymer crystal and a swollen coil was found .",
    "subsequently , a variant of this model was introduced by buzano and pretti @xcite , where the interaction is defined between parallel nearest - neighbour bonds , independent of the straightness required in @xcite , arguing that these should better take into account the contribution of fluctuating bonds , which may be formed even in relatively disordered configurations .",
    "the authors studied this interacting - bond model and the one introduced by foster and seno on the square and simple cubic lattice using the bethe approximation .",
    "they found a first - order transition in the foster - seno model in two and three dimensions , confirming and extending results in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , they found two transitions in the interacting - bond model , a second - order @xmath2-transition from a swollen coil to a collapsed molten globule and then a first - order transition to a folded polymer crystal . in a later paper @xcite , they introduced a competing isotropic interaction and studied its effect in three dimensions using the bethe approximation .",
    "they found a phase diagram with three different phases ( swollen coil , collapsed molten globule , folded polymer crystal ) , similar to that of collapsing semi - stiff polymers @xcite .    in this work",
    "we generalize the foster - seno model to distinguish between nearest - neighbour contacts of parallel and orthogonal straight segments ( see figure  [ interactions ] ) and assign interactions of different strengths to these two types of contacts , investigating it with monte - carlo simulations using the the flatperm algorithm @xcite .",
    "we begin by simulating the foster - seno model and confirm the theoretical picture presented above @xcite .",
    "we then consider our extended model ( in three dimensions ) .",
    "we find evidence for two differently structured folded phases , depending on whether the parallel or orthogonal interactions dominate .",
    "the transition between the swollen coil and each of the two collapsed ordered crystals is first - order .",
    "we investigate the structure of these two low - temperature phases . for strong parallel interactions long segments of the polymer align , whereas for strong orthogonal interactions the polymer forms alternating orthogonally layered @xmath0-sheets .",
    "a polymer is modelled as an @xmath3-step self - avoiding walk on the simple cubic lattice with interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 for nearest - neighbour contacts between parallel and orthogonal _ straight _ segments of the walk , as shown in figure [ interactions ] . here",
    ", a segment is defined as a site along with the two adjoining bonds visited by the walk , and we say that a segment is straight if these two bonds are aligned .",
    "the restriction of this model to @xmath6 is the simple generalisation of the foster - seno model , which was originally defined on a square lattice , to three dimensions .",
    "the total energy for a polymer configuration @xmath7 with @xmath8 monomers ( occupied lattice sites ) is given by @xmath9 depending on the number of non - consecutive parallel and orthogonal straight nearest - neighbour segments @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , along the polymer .",
    "for convenience , we define @xmath12 where @xmath13 for temperature @xmath14 and boltzmann constant @xmath15 . the partition function is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the density of states .",
    "we have simulated this model using the flatperm algorithm @xcite .",
    "the power of this algorithm is the ability to sample the density of states uniformly with respect to a chosen parametrisation , so that the whole parameter range is accessible from one simulation . in practice",
    ", we have also performed multiple independent simulations to further reduce errors .",
    "the natural parameters for this problem are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the algorithm directly estimates the density of states @xmath17 for all @xmath18 for some fixed @xmath19 and all possible values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "canonical averages are performed with respect to this density of states .",
    "as we need to store the full density of states , we only perform simulations up to a maximal length of @xmath20 , due to a memory requirement growing as @xmath21 . to reduce the error , we have taken averages of ten independent runs each .",
    "each run has taken approximately 3 months on a 2.8ghz pc to complete .",
    "fixing one of the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 reduces the size the histogram , and enables us to perform simulations of larger systems , as the memory requirement now grows as @xmath24 .",
    "fixing @xmath23 , say , the algorithm directly estimates a partially summed density of states @xmath25 in this way , we can simulate lengths up to @xmath26 at fixed @xmath23 . in a similar fashion",
    ", we also consider the diagonal @xmath27 , which is equivalent to considering the partially summed density of states @xmath28 to reduce the error for our runs up to @xmath29 , we have taken averages of ten independent runs each .",
    "each run has taken approximately 2 months on a 2.8ghz pc to complete .",

    "width=264 ]    before presenting the findings for our model , we briefly discuss the results of simulations of the foster - seno model in two dimensions .",
    "we find a first - order transition between a swollen coil and ordered collapsed phase in agreement with foster and seno @xcite .",
    "figure  [ hist_2d ] shows the internal density distribution at @xmath31 , where the specific heat is maximal . this distribution is clearly bimodal , and finite - size scaling supports the conclusion that the transition is first - order .",
    "our estimate of @xmath32 is close to the value @xmath33 obtained by foster and seno @xcite from transfer matrix calculations .",
    "the low temperature phase is an ordered @xmath0-sheet type phase .",
    "for the three - dimensional model , we have explored the full two - variable phase space @xmath34 by using a two - parameter flatperm simulation of the model for lengths up to 128 .",
    "we performed @xmath35 independent simulations to ensure convergence and understand the size of the statistical error in our results .",
    "as in previous work @xcite , we found the use of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix of second derivatives of the free energy with respect to the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 most advantageous to show the fluctuations in a unified manner .",
    "figure  [ fl_3d ] displays a density plot of the size of fluctuations for @xmath36 .",
    "it suggests the presence of three thermodynamic phases separated by three phase transition lines meeting at a single point . for small values of @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ", we expect the model to be in the excluded volume universality class of swollen polymers , since at @xmath37 the model reduces to the simple self - avoiding walk .",
    "the question arises as to the nature of the phases for large @xmath22 with @xmath23 fixed and for large @xmath23 with @xmath22 small , and the type of transitions between each of the phases .",
    "this is a density plot of the logarithm of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix of second derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath23 at @xmath38 .",
    "the lighter the shade the larger the value . ,",
    "width=340 ]    we find evidence for a strong collapse phase transition when increasing @xmath22 for fixed @xmath39 .",
    "corrections to scaling at lengths @xmath40 make it difficult to identify the nature of the transition .",
    "the location of the transition seems independent of the value of @xmath23 and is located at @xmath41 for length @xmath38 ; this is taken from the location of the peak of the fluctuations . since our data indicate that this transition occurs for @xmath42 at @xmath41 , it follows that the diagonal line @xmath43 crosses this transition line .",
    "configurations in the collapsed phase are rich in parallel contacts ; we shall discuss further details of the collapsed phase below .",
    "the situation changes significantly for @xmath44 .",
    "when we start from the swollen phase at fixed @xmath45 and increase @xmath22 we see evidence for a strong phase transition to a different collapsed phase , in which orthogonal contacts are expected to play an important role .",
    "further increase of @xmath22 leads to another strong transition to the parallel - contact rich phase .",
    "we investigate the transition between the swollen coil and the orthogonal - contact rich phase by considering the line @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ hist_3d_o ] shows a bimodal internal energy distribution at the maximum of the fluctuations in @xmath11 for length @xmath38 , indicating the presence of a first - order transition .      combining the evidence above , we conjecture the phase diagram shown in figure  [ pd_3d ] , having three phases and three transition lines that meet at a triple point located at @xmath47 for length @xmath38 . by considering the location of this point for different lengths @xmath3 ,",
    "we conclude that its estimate is affected by strong finite - size corrections to scaling .",
    "this figure represents our conjectured schematic phase diagram .",
    "the phases boundaries are marked by black lines .",
    "the dotted - dashed ( blue ) and dashed ( red ) lines denote the lines along which we have performed one - parameter simulations.,width=340 ]    to further elucidate the nature of the phase transitions and the structure of the low - temperature phases , we perform simulations for larger system sizes for the two lines @xmath48 and @xmath43 , using one - parameter flatperm simulations for lengths up to @xmath29 , averaged over ten independent simulations each .",
    "we begin by considering @xmath48 .",
    "the peak of the specific heat occurs at @xmath49 for @xmath29 , which we note is shifted away from the value at length @xmath38 and reflects the presence of strong corrections to scaling .",
    "the distribution of @xmath10 at this point is shown in figure  [ hist_p ] ; we observe a clear bimodal distribution with well - separated peaks and which ranges over fourteen orders of magnitude , convincingly supporting the conclusion of a first - order phase transition .",
    "similarly , along the line @xmath50 we find a single peak of the specific heat , located at @xmath51 for @xmath29 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath52 at this point displays the same characteristics as the transition on the line @xmath48 described above .",
    "our investigations of the transition between the two collapsed phases were not conclusive , as it is difficult to do simulations at very low temperatures . while we expect there to be a first order phase transition between the two collapsed phase we were unable to verify this .      to delineate the nature of the two collapsed phases ,",
    "we have randomly sampled typical configuration for each : two of these are shown in figure  [ configs ] . in each case",
    "we have used @xmath53 , where parallel contacts are attractive . for large @xmath22 , we have a parallel contact rich phase , and typical configurations have lines of monomers arranged in parallel . in figure",
    "[ configs ] , there is a typical configuration for @xmath54 , which demonstrates these parallel @xmath0-lines . for large @xmath23",
    ", orthogonal contacts play an important role . a typical configuration for @xmath55 consists of parallel lines arranged in @xmath0-sheets , which are layered orthogonally .",
    "the entropy of the phase consisting out of orthogonal @xmath0-sheets is lower than the entropy of the phase consisting out of collection of parallel lines , which explains why the collapse - collapse transition line is shifted away from the diagonal .",
    "clearly the formation of @xmath0-sheets is dependent on @xmath22 being positive ( attractive parallel ) interactions .",
