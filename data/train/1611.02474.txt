    "we are interested in the following nonlinear heat equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the laplacian and the gradient in @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 equation can be viewed as the limiting case of the following critical splitting as @xmath13 , which was introduced by chipot and weissler @xcite : @xmath14    the cauchy problem for can be solved in several functional spaces @xmath15 , for example @xmath16 or in a special affine space @xmath17 for some positive constant @xmath18 with @xmath19 in particular , the problem has a unique classical solution @xmath20 defined on @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( see remark [ rem : cauchypro ] for more details ) . in the case",
    "@xmath23 , we have the global existence for @xmath24 ; on the contrary , i.e @xmath25 , we say that the solution @xmath24 blows up in finite time @xmath2 , namely @xmath26    as for the case of equation , the value @xmath27 is a critical exponent for different reasons ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the sub - critical and super - critical cases ) .",
    "one reason is that , when @xmath27 , equation is invariant under the following transformation : @xmath30 as for the equation without the gradient term , i.e @xmath3 .",
    "recalling that equation is invariant under the transformation @xmath31    let us now sketch the main results for the case of the equation @xmath32 one of the first result for the finite - time blow up problem is due to friedman and mcloed @xcite who proved the following upper and lower bounds for the blowup rate of @xmath33 under some conditions on the initial data , @xmath34 for some @xmath35 positive ( see also berbenes and eberly @xcite for this estimate ) .",
    "the study of the blowup behavior for solution is done through the introduction of similarity variables @xmath36 where @xmath18 may or not be a blowup point for @xmath33 . from , we see that @xmath37 satisfies the following equation : for all @xmath38 , @xmath39 since @xmath40 as @xmath41 , the change of variables converts any question about the blowup of @xmath33 into one about the large time asymptotic of @xmath37 .",
    "according to berbenes and eberly @xcite , we know that if @xmath42 is a solution of which blows up at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then @xmath45 = \\lim_{s \\to + \\infty } w_a(y , s ) = 0,\\ ] ] uniformly on compact sets @xmath46 .",
    "this estimate has been refined until the higher order by bebernes and briche @xcite , herrero and velzquez @xcite in one dimensional case .",
    "more precisely , they classified the behavior of @xmath37 for @xmath47 bounded , and showed that one of the following cases occurs : @xmath48 or @xmath49 ( the exponential convergence has been refined up to order @xmath50 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable that a similar result can be extended to higher dimensional cases by using the technique of @xcite for the equation @xmath51    when occurs , the authors of @xcite established the following blowup profile in the variable @xmath52 ( which is the intermediate scale that separates the regular and singular parts ) @xmath53 = \\lim_{s \\to + \\infty}w_a(z\\sqrt{s},s ) = \\phi_0(z),\\ ] ] uniformly on compacts in @xmath54 , where @xmath55 note that was formally obtained in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite by means of the method of matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "the asymptotic behavior leads to the limiting profile in the @xmath42 variable , in the sense that @xmath56 when @xmath41 if @xmath57 and @xmath58 is in the neighborhood of @xmath18 with @xmath59 in @xcite and @xcite , bressan proved the existence of solutions to which blow up in finite time and verify the behavior .",
    "he also obtained the stability of such blowup behavior with respect to small perturbations of the the initial data . for more results related to equation , see fila and pulkkinen @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .    by considering @xmath60 and @xmath27 in ,",
    "we want to ask whether the nonlinear gradient term appearing in the equation affects the blowup profile of the case @xmath3 , i.e equation .",
    "note that the case @xmath28 can be considered as a perturbation of equation because the nonlinear gradient term has a sub - critical size in the sense that in the similarity variables setting , equation yields @xmath61 this gives another explanation to the fact that problem is critical when @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , our problem is motivated by the work of tayachi and zaag @xcite treated for equation . in that paper",
    ", the authors construct for a solution which blows up in finite time @xmath2 only at the origin and give a sharp description of its blowup profile in the case where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the originality of @xcite lays in the fact that the constructed solution does not exist in the case of the standard nonlinear heat equation .",
    "in particular , their solution has a profile depending on the variable @xmath64 which is different from the results for equation by herrero and velzquez @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , bricmont and kupianen @xcite , where the blowup profiles depend on the reduced variables @xmath65 this evidently shows the effect of the forcing gradient term in equation with @xmath62 in the equation .",
    "it is worth to mention the work by ebde and zaag @xcite where the authors considered equation in the case where @xmath66 is sub - critical , i.e @xmath67 .",
    "they showed that the involved nonlinear gradient term in does not affect to the final blowup profile , leading to the same result ( construction and stability of a solution whose blowup profile depends on the variable @xmath68 ) for the standard nonlinear heat equation obtained in @xcite and @xcite . for more results related to , see galaktionov and vzquez @xcite , @xcite , snoussi , tayachi and weissler @xcite , chipot and weissler @xcite , fila @xcite , souplet , tayachi and weissler @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , chlebk , fila and quittner @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we aim at constructing a solution for equation and giving precisely the description of its blowup profile .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ theo:1 ] let @xmath69 and @xmath27 , there exists @xmath70 such that for each @xmath71 $ ] , equation has a solution @xmath42 such that @xmath33 and @xmath72 blow up in finite time @xmath2 at the origin simultaneously .",
    "moreover ,    * for all @xmath73 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is some positive constant and @xmath76 * the functions @xmath77 and @xmath72 blow up at the origin and only there .",
    "* there exists a function @xmath78 defined on @xmath79 such that @xmath80 and @xmath81 as @xmath41 , uniformly on compact sets of @xmath79 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 the initial data for which equation has a solution blowing up in finite time @xmath2 at the origin and verifying the behavior and is given by formulation below .",
    "note that the initial datum @xmath84 defined in does not belong to @xmath85 .",
    "however , the local in time cauchy problem for equation is well - posed in @xmath86 , where @xmath86 is defined by . indeed",
    ", if we define @xmath87 by @xmath88 , equation is equivalent to @xmath89 since @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are bounded , we see by classical arguments that equation is well - posed in @xmath93 . thus , there exists a unique maximum solution on @xmath94 for equation with @xmath22 corresponding to the initial datum @xmath95 given by .    the derivation of the profile @xmath96 can be understood through a formal analysis given in section [ sec : formalapproach ] below .",
    "we impose the condition @xmath69 in order to have a bounded profile .    from part @xmath97 of theorem [ theo:1 ]",
    ", we see that the point @xmath98 is an isolated blowup point . in order to prove this result",
    ", we need to establish a new _ `` no blowup under some threshold '' _ of a parabolic inequality with a nonlinear gradient term , see proposition [ prop : noblowup ] below .",
    "the results stated in theorem [ theo:1 ] also hold for more general equations than , that is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is lipschitz and satisfies @xmath101 indeed , the nonlinear term @xmath102 can be considered as subcritical ( in size ) in comparison with the main nonlinear terms in the equation , therefore , a simple perturbation of our proof can be extended to this case without difficulties .",
    "we see from part @xmath103 of theorem [ theo:1 ] that the constructed non self - similar solution has the profile depending on the variable @xmath104 which is the same for the case of equations and without the nonlinear gradient term ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "unlike the work done by tayachi and zaag in @xcite , where the authors constructed for equation with @xmath62 and @xmath105 a stable blowup solution having a blowup profile depending on the variable and satisfying @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a positive constant which goes to @xmath108 as @xmath109 .",
    "thus , their result does not recover the result obtained in @xcite and @xcite for the case @xmath3 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 ; on the contrary , our result obtained for equation recovers the case @xmath3 .",
    "by the space translation invariance of equation , the result of theorem [ theo:1 ] can be stated for any arbitrary considered point @xmath112 as a blowup point of the solution , in particular , we have for all @xmath73 , @xmath113 and the final blowup profile satisfies @xmath114    we conjecture that the identity also holds after differentiating , namely that @xmath115 where @xmath116 is some positive constant .",
    "we strongly believe that with some better refined estimate of , we could obtain such a final profile for the gradient solution .",
    "unfortunately , we are only able to derive in this work a weaker result given in .    in comparison with the work in @xcite , where the authors deal with the study of the behavior of the profile near blowup of the following quasilinear parabolic equation",
    "@xmath117 our problem can be considered as the limit case of equation as @xmath118 , and our result obtained @xmath119 of theorem [ theo:1 ] is quite different from that of @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they showed that in the case of the single point blowup in the equation and under the radially symmetric , i.e @xmath120 with @xmath121 , and nonincreasing assumption ( see theorem 8 , page 36 in @xcite ) , the profile near blowup is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a positive appreciated constant .",
    "as in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) , it is possible to make the interpretation of the finite - dimensional variable in terms of the blowup time and the blowup point .",
    "this allows us to derive the stability of the profile @xmath96 in theorem [ theo:1 ] with respect to perturbations of the initial data .",
    "more precisely , we have the following :    [ theo:2 ] let us denote by @xmath124 the solution constructed in theorem [ theo:1 ] and by @xmath125 its blowup time .",
    "then , there exists a neighborhood @xmath126 of @xmath127 in @xmath86 defined in such that for any @xmath128 , equation has a unique solution @xmath129 with initial data @xmath95 , and @xmath42 blows up in finite time @xmath130 at point @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , estimate is satisfied by @xmath132 and @xmath133    as in @xcite , we conjecture that the blowup pattern just described in part @xmath103 of theorem [ theo:1 ] is generic , i.e there exists an open , everywhere dense set @xmath126 of initial data whose corresponding solutions either converge to a steady state , or blowup in finite time at a single point , according to the estimate .",
    "up to our knowledge , the only proof for the genericity is given by herrero and velzquez @xcite for equation without the nonlinear gradient term ( @xmath3 ) in the one dimensional case .    we will not give the proof of theorem [ theo:2 ] because the stability result follows from the reduction to a finite dimensional case as in @xcite ( see theorem 2 and its proof in section 4 ) and @xcite ( see theorem 9 and its proof in section 6 ) with the same argument . hence , we only prove the exsitence result ( theorem [ theo:1 ] ) and kindly refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for the proof of the stability .",
    "let us now give the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ theo:1 ] .",
    "note that our proof is quite different from that of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) treated for equation . here , we follow the method developed by bricmont and kupiainen @xcite , and modified by merle and zaag @xcite for the construction of a stable blowup solution to equation .",
    "note that the method of @xcite has been proved to be successful for various situations including parabolic and hyperbolic equations .",
    "for the parabolic equations , we would like to mention the works by masmoudi and zaag @xcite ( see also the earlier work by zaag @xcite ) for the complex ginzburg - landau equation with no gradient structure , by nguyen and zaag @xcite , @xcite for a logarithmically perturbed nonlinear heat equation and for a refined blowup profile for equation , or by nouaili and zaag @xcite for a non - variational complex - valued semilinear heat equation , by ghoul , nguyen and zaag @xcite for a non - variational parabolic system .",
    "there are also the cases for the construction of multi - solitons for the semilinear wave equation in one space dimension by cte and zaag @xcite .",
    "our goal is to construct for equation a solution @xmath129 which blows up in finite time @xmath2 and verifies the behaviors .",
    "the proof is performed in the framework of the similarity variables defined in . by the space translation invariance of equation",
    ", we may assume @xmath134 in and write @xmath135 for simplicity of the notation .",
    "we recall from that when @xmath27 , @xmath136 solves the equation @xmath137 if we introduce @xmath138 then @xmath139 solves @xmath140 constructing a solution for satisfying reduces to the construction of a solution for such that @xmath141 where @xmath142 satisfies the equation @xmath143 and @xmath144 satisfying such a property is guaranteed by a condition that @xmath145 belongs to some set @xmath146 which shrinks to @xmath147 as @xmath40 ( see item @xmath103 in definition [ def : st ] below for an example ) . let us insist on the fact that we do not work with equation , but with equation ( see explaination below ) .",
    "since the linearization of equation around the profile @xmath148 gives @xmath149 positive modes , @xmath150 zero modes , and an infinite dimensional negative part , we can use the method of @xcite and @xcite which relies on two arguments :    * the use of the bounding effect of the heat kernel to reduce the problem of the control of @xmath145 in @xmath146 to the control of its positive modes ( in fact , we control a modified version of @xmath142 in @xmath151 ; see proposition [ prop : redu ] ) . let us insist on the fact that if we linearize equation around @xmath96 , say that @xmath152 , we could not able to control @xmath153 outside the _ blowup region _ because in this region the linear part of the equation satisfied by @xmath153 does not have a fully negative spectrum . in the contrary ,",
    "the spectrum of the linear operator of the equation satisfied by @xmath142 is negative outside the _ blowup region _ , which makes the control of @xmath142 in that region easily .",
    "+ * the control of the @xmath154 positive modes thanks to a topological argument based on index theory ( see the arguments at page ) .",
    "( note that the topological argument is also used in @xcite to solve the finite dimensional problem , however , the approach of the reduction of the problem to a finite dimensional one in our proof is totally different from that in @xcite ) .",
    "+ since the gradient term in the equation in the critical case contributes to the change of the blowup profile and given the fact that the blowup profile @xmath96 is different from the one considered in @xcite and @xcite , our proof truly requires crucial modifications of the methods of @xcite and @xcite and special arguments in order to handle the nonlinear gradient term .",
    "these modifications lay in the following places :    * we no longer work with the linearization of equation around @xmath96 , but instead the equation satisfied by @xmath155 .",
    "note that linearizing around the profile @xmath96 generates the linear operator @xmath156 which behaves similarly as in the power case ( equation ) inside the _ blowup region _ , but there is a quite difference outside the _ blowup region_. indeed , bricmont and kupiainen s approach for equation gives that the spectrum of @xmath156 in the outer region is controlled by @xmath157 which can be made negative by taking @xmath158 small enough .",
    "whereas , the same estimate for equation gives that the spectrum of @xmath156 is controlled by @xmath159 , which can never be made negative . in order to overcome this difficulty , we no longer work with the linearization of equation around @xmath96 , but",
    "instead the equation satisfied by @xmath142 .",
    "in fact , the spectrum of the linear part of equation is fully negative in the outer region , which make it easy to control .",
    "however , this manner gives additionally a term of the form @xmath160 ( see ) which is needed new ideas to achieve the control .",
    "* defining the shrinking set @xmath161 ( see definition [ def : st ] below ) to trap the solution .",
    "note that our definition of @xmath161 is defferent from the one in @xcite designed for the standard nonlinear heat equation with @xmath3 .",
    "note also that equation is almost the same as in @xcite , except for the nonlinear gradient term which causes serious difficulties in the analysis . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced estimates of @xmath142 in the _ blowup region _",
    "@xmath162 , and in the regular region @xmath163 .",
    "however , the estimates in the region @xmath164 imply smallness of @xmath142 only , and do not allow any control of the nonlinear gradient term in this region .",
    "in other words , the analysis based on the method of @xcite , that is to estimate the solution in the @xmath52 variable is not sufficient and must be improved . in particular ,",
    "we introduce estimates of @xmath142 in three regions in a different variable scale , which follows the approach of @xcite using for a finite time quenching problem of vortex reconnection with the boundary .",
    "more precisely , in the _ blowup region _ , i.e. @xmath165 , we do an asymptotic analysis around the profile @xmath166 through equation . in the intermediate region ,",
    "i.e. @xmath167 , we control the solution by using classical parabolic estimates through introducing a rescaled function of @xmath33 ( see below ) . in the regular region ,",
    "i.e. @xmath168 , we estimate directly @xmath33 .",
    "the estimates in the intermediate and regular regions allow us to control the nonlinear gradient term appearing in equation .",
    "the derivation of the final profile @xmath169 stated in part @xmath119 of theorem [ theo:1 ] uses the method of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in this subsection , we use matching asymptotics to formally derive the blowup behavior of the solution to .",
    "more precisely , we will explain how to deduce the following behavior @xmath172 where @xmath96 is defined by .    in the similarity variables setting ,",
    "justifying is equivalent to showing that @xmath173 where @xmath136 satisfies .",
    "let us rewrite the equation on @xmath136 as follows : @xmath174 where @xmath175 and @xmath176 note that we have @xmath177 the linear operator @xmath178 is self - adjoint in @xmath179 , where @xmath179 is the weighted @xmath180 space associated with the weight @xmath181 defined by @xmath182 it can be shown that the spectrum of @xmath178 is explicitly given by ( see @xcite for instance ) @xmath183 for @xmath184 , all the eigenvalues are simple and the eigenfunctions are dilations of hermite polynomials : the eigenvalue @xmath185 corresponds to the following eigenfunction : @xmath186 } \\frac{n!}{i!(n - 2i)!}(-1)^iy^{n - 2i}.\\ ] ] the first three eigenfunctions are @xmath187 notice that @xmath188 satisfies @xmath189 we also introduce @xmath190 . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the eigenfuntions are formed by taking products of the polynomials @xmath191 , namely that for @xmath192 , the eigenfunction corresponding to @xmath193 ( @xmath194 ) is @xmath195    since the eigenfunctions of @xmath178 span the whole space @xmath179 , we can expand the solution @xmath136 as follows : @xmath196 for simplicity , let us assume that the solution is radially symmetric in @xmath197 . since @xmath198 with @xmath199 correspond to negative eigenvalues of @xmath178 , we may consider that @xmath200 with @xmath201 as @xmath40 ( for simplicity in the notation , we write @xmath202 instead of @xmath203 ) .",
    "writing @xmath204 , multiplying equation by @xmath205 and @xmath206 respectively and integrating over @xmath207 , we derive the following ode system for @xmath208 and @xmath209 : @xmath210 assuming that @xmath211 which yields @xmath212 from equation and the above formula of @xmath209 , we have @xmath213 , which gives @xmath214 from the above formulas of @xmath208 and @xmath209 , we have by equation , @xmath215 hence , @xmath216 such @xmath208 and @xmath209 are compatible with the assumption .",
    "therefore , we write by , @xmath217 in @xmath218 , and also uniformly in compact sets by standard parabolic regularity .",
    "since provides a relevant variable for blowup , namely @xmath52 , we then try to search formally solutions of of the form @xmath219 and compare elements of order @xmath220 . for @xmath221 and @xmath222",
