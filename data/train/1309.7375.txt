    "in this paper we introduce and study two models of _ random subcube intersection graphs_. these are random graph models obtained by ( i ) selecting a random collection of subcubes of a fixed hypercube @xmath0 , to serve as the vertices of the graph , and ( ii ) setting an edge between a pair of subcubes if their intersection is non - empty .",
    "our basic motivation for studying these random graphs is that they give a model for ` random compatibility ' between vertices . before we make our models mathematically precise",
    "let us consider some examples of the applications we have in mind .",
    "a first example is the random @xmath2-sat problem , which has attracted the attention of both physicists @xcite and mathematicians @xcite for many decades . in this problem",
    "we have a set of @xmath3 boolean variables and some number @xmath4 of boolean clauses on @xmath2 variables are chosen at random .",
    "each clause forbids exactly one of the @xmath5 possible assignments to the @xmath2 variables in the clause and the question of interest is whether there exists an assignment to the @xmath3 variables which is compatible with all the clauses .",
    "it is known that there is a sharp threshold  @xcite for satisfiability with respect to the number @xmath4 of clauses chosen and that for large @xmath2  @xcite this threshold is located at approximately @xmath6 .",
    "it is conjectured that for all fixed @xmath2 there exists a constant @xmath7 such that the satisfiability threshold is asymptotically @xmath8 ( a proof of this conjecture for all sufficiently large values of @xmath2 has been announced recently  @xcite ) .",
    "the random @xmath2-sat problem is a problem about random subcubes .",
    "given a clause @xmath9 the assignments which are incompatible with @xmath9 are given by the subcube where the @xmath2 variables in @xmath9 are assigned the values forbidden by @xmath9 .",
    "this is an @xmath10-dimensional subcube of the @xmath3-dimensional cube of all possible assignments , and a collection of clauses is unsatisfiable if and only if the union of the corresponding subcubes contains all vertices of the @xmath3-cube .",
    "the random @xmath2-sat problem is thus equivalent to finding the threshold for covering all the vertices of a cube by a collection of random subcubes .",
    "this example also suggests that a mathematical analysis of the covering problem will be harder for subcubes than for e.g. the usual independent random intersection graph models ( where it is analogous to the classical coupon collector problem ) .",
    "a second example of applications we have in mind comes from social choice theory .",
    "suppose we have a society @xmath11 which is faced with @xmath12 political issues , each which can be resolved in a binary fashion .",
    "we represent the two policies possible on each issue by @xmath13 , and the family of all possible sets of policies by a @xmath12-dimensional hypercube @xmath0 .",
    "individual members of the society may have fixed views on some issues , but may be undecided or indifferent on others .",
    "we can thus associate to each citizen @xmath14 a subcube of acceptable policies @xmath15 in a natural way .",
    "the subcube intersection graph @xmath16 arising from @xmath17 then represents political agreement within the society : @xmath18 is an edge of @xmath16 if and only if the citizens @xmath19 and @xmath20 can agree on a mutually acceptable set of policies .",
    "a key characteristic of subcube intersection graphs is that they possess the _ helly property _ : if we have @xmath1 subcubes @xmath21 of @xmath0 which are pairwise intersecting , then their total intersection @xmath22 is non - empty ( this is an easy observation , already made in  @xcite ) .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that in the model for political agreement described above , @xmath1-cliques represent @xmath1-sets of citizens able to agree on a mutually acceptable set of policies and , say , unite their forces to promote a common political platform .",
    "this example motivates our study of the clique number in ( random ) subcube intersection graphs .",
    "there are many other examples of compatibility graphs naturally modeled by subcube intersection graphs .",
    "some closely resemble the one above : the work of matrimonial agencies or the assignment of room - mates in the first year at university for instance naturally lead to the study of such compatibility graphs . another class of examples can be found in the medical sciences . for kidney or blood donations , several parameters must be taken into account to determine whether a potential donor  receiver pair is compatible .",
    "large random subcube intersection graphs provide a way of modeling these compatibility relations over a large pool of donors and receiver , and of identifying efficient matching schemes .",
    "let us now describe our models more precisely .",
    "we begin with some basic definitions and notation .",
    "a _ feature system _ is a triple @xmath23 , where @xmath11 is a set of vertices , @xmath24 is a set of _ features _ , and @xmath25 is a function mapping vertices in @xmath11 to subsets of @xmath24 . given a vertex @xmath14 , we call @xmath26 its _ feature set_. we construct a graph @xmath16 on the vertex - set @xmath11 from a feature system @xmath23 by placing an edge between @xmath27 if their feature sets @xmath28 have non - empty intersection",
    ". we call @xmath16 the _ intersection graph _ of the feature system @xmath29",
    ".    in this paper we shall study intersection graphs where @xmath24 and the feature sets @xmath30 have some additional structure .",
    "namely , @xmath24 shall be a high - dimensional hypercube @xmath0 and the feature sets will consist of subcubes of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath12-dimensional hypercube _ is the set @xmath31 .",
    "a _ @xmath2-dimensional subcube _ of @xmath0 is a subset obtained by fixing @xmath32-coordinates and letting the remaining @xmath2 vary freely .",
    "we may regard subcubes of @xmath0 as elements of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 coordinates are free and the @xmath13 coordinates are fixed .",
    "we shall define two models of random subcube intersection graphs .",
    "both of these are obtained by randomly assigning to each vertex @xmath35 a feature subcube @xmath15 of @xmath0 and then building the resulting intersection graph .",
    "let @xmath11 be a set of vertices .",
    "fix @xmath36 with @xmath37 . for each @xmath35",
    "independently select a @xmath2-dimensional subcube @xmath15 of @xmath0 uniformly at random , and set an edge between @xmath27 if @xmath38 . denote the resulting random subcube intersection graph by @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a set of vertices .",
    "fix @xmath40 and @xmath41 $ ] . for each @xmath14",
    "independently select a subcube @xmath42 at random by setting @xmath43 with probability @xmath44 and @xmath45 each with probability @xmath46 independently for each coordinate @xmath47 ( we refer to such a subcube as a _ binomial random subcube _ ) .",
    "denote the resulting random subcube intersection graph by @xmath48 .",
    "[ binomial d as intersection of binomial 1 ] we may view @xmath49 as the intersection of @xmath12 independent copies of @xmath50 on a common vertex - set @xmath11 .",
    "indeed an edge @xmath18 of @xmath49 is present if and only if for each of the @xmath12 dimensions of @xmath0 we have that @xmath51 and @xmath15 , seen as vectors , are identical or at least one of them is @xmath34 . the graph @xmath50 is itself rather easy to visualise : we first randomly colour the vertices in @xmath11 with colours from @xmath52 , and then remove from the complete graph on @xmath11 all edges between vertices in colour @xmath53 and vertices in colour @xmath54 .",
    "our two models of random subcube intersection graphs bear some resemblance to previous random graph models . to give the reader some early intuition into the nature of random subcube intersection graphs ,",
    "we invite her to consider the degree distributions and edge - densities found in them , and to contrast them with models of random graphs with similar degree distributions and edge - densities .",
    "let us first note that in order to get an random model which is both structurally interesting and amenable to asymptotic analysis we typically consider the case where @xmath55 , and the other parameters are functions of @xmath12 .",
    "the degree of a given vertex in the uniform model @xmath56 is a binomial random variable with parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath58 is the probability that two uniformly chosen @xmath2-dimensional subcubes of @xmath0 meet .",
    "if @xmath59 for some fixed @xmath60 , then one can show @xmath61 , where @xmath62 this expression is not , however , terribly instructive .",
    "the quantity @xmath58 is also the edge - density of @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath64 , the appropriate random graph to compare and contrast it with is thus an erds  rnyi random graph @xmath65 with edge probability @xmath58 . however @xmath39 displays some significant _ clustering _",
    ": our results can be used to show for instance that dependencies between the edges cause triangles to appear well before we see a linear number of edges , in contrast to the erds  rnyi model @xmath65 .",
    "the edge - density of the binomial model @xmath49 is easy to compute : it is exactly @xmath66 .",
    "the degree distribution of @xmath67 is more complicated , however .",
    "increasing the dimension of a subcube by @xmath54 doubles its volume inside @xmath0 , so that larger subcubes expect much larger degrees .",
    "the number of feature subcubes from our graph met by a fixed subcube of dimension @xmath68 is a binomial random variable with parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the number of vertices in @xmath11 whose feature subcubes have dimension @xmath68 is itself a binomial random variable with parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 . as in this paper",
    "we will typically be interested in the case where @xmath12 is large and @xmath11 has size exponential in @xmath12 , we will expect to see some feature subcubes with dimension much larger or much smaller than @xmath73 . this will have a noticeable effect on the properties of the graph @xmath48 .     with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the row of vertices at the bottom right are all isolated . ]    among the random graph models studied in the literature , @xmath48 in many ways resemble the multi - type inhomogeneous random graphs studied in  @xcite , which also have vertices of several different types and differing edge probabilities , though we should point out there are significant differences .",
    "first of all some ` types ' corresponding to vertices with unusually large or unusually small feature subcubes will have only a sublinear ( and random ) number of representatives .",
    "secondly , the binomial model shares the clustering behaviour of the uniform model ( see remark  [ clustering binomial case ] ) , differentiating it from the models considered in  @xcite .",
    "we note that a further general model for inhomogeneous random graphs with clustering was introduced by bollobs , janson and riordan in  @xcite , for which this second point does not apply .",
    "finally , let us mention the standard models of _ random intersection graphs_. write @xmath77 $ ] for the discrete interval @xmath78 . in the _ binomial random intersection graph model _",
    "@xmath79,p)$ ] , each vertex @xmath35 is independently assigned a random feature set @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "this feature set is obtained by including @xmath81 $ ] into @xmath15 with probability @xmath44 and leaving it out otherwise independently at random for each feature @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "edges are then added between all pairs of vertices @xmath27 with @xmath38 to obtain a random intersection graph on @xmath11 .",
    "a variant on this model is to choose feature sets @xmath15 uniformly at random from the @xmath2-subsets of @xmath77 $ ] ; this yields the _ uniform random intersection graph model _",
    "@xmath79 , k)$ ] .",
    "while these two random intersection graph models bear some resemblance ( in terms of clustering , for example ) to our random subcube intersection graph models , there are also some significant differences due to the underlying structure of our feature sets .",
    "let us note amongst other things that random intersection graphs do not have the helly property , and that the effects on the degree of increasing the size of a feature set by @xmath54 in a binomial random intersection graph are far less dramatic than the effects of increasing the dimension of a feature subcube by @xmath54 in a binomial random subcube intersection graph .",
    "in particular , the binomial random subcube intersection graph model @xmath49 has a much more dramatic variation of degrees than its non - structured counterpart @xmath79,p)$ ] .",
    "we end this section by noting that there has been some interest in another model of ` structured ' random intersection graphs , namely _ random interval graphs_. the idea here is to associate to each vertex @xmath35 a feature interval @xmath82\\subseteq [ 0,1]$ ] at random and to set an edge between @xmath27 whenever @xmath83 . here",
    "` at random ' means the intervals are generated by independent pairs of uniform @xmath84 random variables , which serve as the endpoints .",
    "a @xmath12-dimensional version of this model also exists , where we associate to each vertex a @xmath12-dimensional box lying inside @xmath85^d$ ] .",
    "this gives rise to _",
    "( random ) @xmath12-box graphs_.    in the setting of interval or @xmath12-box graphs , we do have the helly property .",
    "the random interval and random @xmath12-box graph models are however quite different from the random subcube intersection graphs we study in this paper .",
    "indeed , for @xmath86 subcube intersection graphs can be viewed as interval graphs where the feature intervals @xmath87 are restricted to a small set of possible values , for example @xmath85 $ ] , @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 $ ] ( to correspond to @xmath34 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively ) .",
    "this naturally leads to a very different structure .",
    "subcube intersection graphs were introduced by johnson and markstrm  @xcite , with motivation coming from the example in social choice theory we discussed above .",
    "they studied cliques in subcube intersection graphs from an extremal perspective , obtaining a number of results on ramsey- and turn - type problems and providing a counterpoint to the probabilistic perspective of the work undertaken in this paper .",
    "the random intersection graph models @xmath79,p)$ ] and @xmath79,k)$ ] we presented in the previous subsection have for their part received extensive attention from the research community since they were introduced by karoski , scheinerman and singer - cohen  @xcite and singer - cohen  @xcite . by now , many results are known on their connectivity  @xcite , hamiltonicity  @xcite , component evolution  @xcite , clique number  @xcite , independence number  @xcite , chromatic number  @xcite , degree distribution @xcite and near - equivalence to the erds ",
    "rnyi model @xmath90 for some range of the parameters  @xcite , amongst other properties .",
    "even more recently , there has been interest in obtaining versions of the results cited above for inhomogeneous random intersection graph models .",
    "finally there has been some work on random intersection graphs and @xmath12-box graphs that runs somewhat parallel to the work of johnson and markstrm and of this paper . from an extremal perspective",
    ", sufficient conditions for the existence of large cliques in @xmath12-box graphs were investigated by berg , norine , su , thomas and wollan  @xcite in the context of models for social agreement and approval voting , while random interval graphs were introduced by scheinerman  @xcite , and have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the behaviour of the binomial and uniform subcube intersection models when @xmath12 is large ( see remark  [ choice of parameters ] below for a discussion of the constant @xmath12 case ) .",
    "we study two main properties , that of containing a clique of size @xmath91 , and that of covering the entirety of the underlying hypercube @xmath0 with the union @xmath92 of the feature subcubes .",
    "both of these properties are closed under the addition of vertices to @xmath11 ( or , equivalently , of subcubes @xmath15 to the family of feature subcubes ) .",
    "the question is then how large @xmath11 needs to be for these properties to hold _ with high probability _ ( whp ) , that it to say with probability tending to @xmath54 as @xmath93 . in the case of covering",
    ", this question can be thought of as a structured variant of the classical coupon collector problem ( see the discussion at the beginning of section  [ binomial : at covering ] ) .",
    "formally , we take a dynamic view of our models : for fixed @xmath94 $ ] we consider a nested sequence of vertex sets @xmath95 , with @xmath96 , and corresponding nested sequences of binomial random subcube intersection graphs @xmath97 and uniform random subcube intersection graphs @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 be a property of subcube intersection graphs that is closed with respect to the addition of vertices .",

    "@xmath100 for @xmath99 for the binomial sequence @xmath101 is @xmath102 similarly , we define the _ hitting time _",
    "@xmath103 for @xmath99 for the uniform sequence @xmath104 is @xmath105    in this paper , we restrict our attention to the binomial model @xmath49 with @xmath106 fixed , and to the uniform model @xmath39 with @xmath107 for @xmath60 fixed . in both cases , the interesting behaviour occurs when @xmath108 for @xmath109 bounded away from @xmath53 .",
    "we thus typically use this number @xmath109 as a parameter , rather than the actual number @xmath110 of vertices in the graph .",
    "our aim is to establish concentration of the exponent of the hitting time .",
    "we thus make the following definitions :    let @xmath99 be a property of subcube intersection graphs that is closed with respect to the addition of vertices .",
    "a real number @xmath111 is a _ threshold _ for @xmath99 in the binomial model ( with parameter @xmath44 ) if @xmath112 in probability as @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , we say that @xmath111 is a _ threshold _ for @xmath99 in the uniform model ( with parameter @xmath113 ) if @xmath114 in probability as @xmath93 .",
    "in other words , @xmath115 is a threshold for the binomial model if for any sequence of vertex sets @xmath116 @xmath117 and a similar statement holds in the case of the uniform model .",
    "our main results are determining the thresholds for the appearance of cliques and for covering the ambient hypercube in both the binomial and the uniform model . in most cases",
    "we also give some slightly more precise information about the thresholds , going into the lower order terms .",
    "we show in particular that around the covering threshold , the clique number of our models undergoes a transition : below the covering threshold , the clique number is whp of order @xmath118 ; close to the covering threshold , it is whp of order a power of @xmath12 ; finally above the covering threshold , it is whp of order exponential in @xmath12 .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section  [ binomialsection ] , we state and prove our results for the binomial model . in section  [ uniformsection ]",
    "we use these to obtain our results for the uniform model . finally in section  [ remarkssection ]",
    "we discuss small @xmath44 and large @xmath44 behaviour , and end with a number of open problems .",
    "[ choice of parameters ] in this paper , as we have said , we are focussing on our models in the case where @xmath119 .",
    "what happens when @xmath12 is fixed and the number of vertices goes to infinity ? in some applications , this may be a more relevant choice of parameters .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour in this case is however much simpler .",
    "indeed , let @xmath12 be fixed and let @xmath120 be the family of all subcubes of @xmath0 .",
    "we may define a subcube intersection graph @xmath121 on @xmath120 by setting an edge between two subcubes if their intersection is non - empty .",
    "the binomial model @xmath122 is then just a _ random weighted blow - up _ of @xmath121 : each vertex @xmath20 of @xmath121 is replaced by a clique with a random size @xmath123 , where @xmath124 , and by standard chernoff bounds @xmath125 for every @xmath20 , where @xmath126 is the probability that a binomial random cube is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "thus knowledge of the finite graph @xmath121 will give us essentially all the information we could require concerning the graph @xmath49 as @xmath127 .    similarly , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath63 for @xmath12 fixed can be inferred from the properties of the intersection graph @xmath128 of the @xmath2-dimensional subcubes of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that this latter graph @xmath128 may be thought of as a subcube analogue of ( the complement of ) a kneser graph , and may be interesting in its own right as a graph theoretical object ; this is however outside the scope of the present paper .      throughout this paper",
    "we shall need some standard approximations .",
    "in particular we shall often use @xmath129 ( for @xmath130 fixed ) and @xmath131 ( for @xmath132 ) .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath133 to denote that @xmath134 , and @xmath135 to denote that @xmath136 .",
    "in this section , we prove our results for the binomial model .",
    "denote by @xmath137 the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices . recall that the _ clique number _ @xmath138 of a graph @xmath16 is the largest @xmath1 such that @xmath16 contains a copy of @xmath137 as a subgraph .",

    "in this paper we focussed on the case where @xmath106 is fixed ( in the binomial model ) .",
    "let us make here a few remarks about the small @xmath44 and large @xmath44 case .",
    "* small @xmath44 : * note first of all that the proofs of theorems  [ binomial s<<d / log d ] , [ binomial covering threshold ] and  [ binomial s>>d / logd ] all extend to the case when @xmath478 as @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , theorems  [ uniform : at the threshold ] and  [ uniform : above the threshold ] for the uniform model also hold when @xmath479 as @xmath93 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ uniform : below the threshold ] does not , however , go through as it is stated in the paper  it needs stronger concentration for the dimension of the feature subcubes in proposition  [ prop : dimension of subcubes in s - cliques ] .",
    "there are two further remarks worth making concerning the small @xmath44 case .",
    "first of all , as @xmath44 ( or @xmath253 ) tends to @xmath53 , the covering results theorems  [ binomial covering threshold ] and  [ uniform : at the threshold ] ` converge ' to the classical coupon collector problem .",
    "taking @xmath480 and independently drawing random elements from @xmath24 , we expect to make roughly @xmath481 draws before we cover @xmath24 , and this is the limit of @xmath482 as @xmath483 ( binomial model ) and of @xmath484 as @xmath485 ( uniform model ) .",
    "secondly , for the uniform model with constant parameter @xmath486 , the uniform model is closely related to bond percolation on the hypercube , which is a well - studied model of random graph in its own right ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the binomial model with parameter @xmath487 is different : the dimension of its feature subcubes have an approximatively poisson distribution , and one does see feature subcubes of large bounded dimension .",
    "these will have an impact on the thresholds for lower - order cliques  indeed , a quick calculation shows that for @xmath1 fixed , the expected dimension of feature subcubes in @xmath1-cliques of @xmath488 is @xmath489 .",
    "* large @xmath44 : * in this case , we expect quasirandom behaviour from @xmath49 ( behaviour ` like and erds  rnyi random graph ' ) .",
    "we establish it below in the special case when @xmath490 , with @xmath491 of order @xmath492 , when the edge - density is of constant order .",
    "[ quasirandomness ] let @xmath491 be a sequence of reals from the interval @xmath85 $ ] with @xmath493 bounded away from both @xmath53 and @xmath494 .",
    "then for @xmath495 , with probability tending to @xmath54 as @xmath496 the graph @xmath186,d , p}$ ] is quasirandom with parameter @xmath497 .",
    "we shall use the celebrated quasirandomness theorem of chung , graham and wilson  @xcite , which states ( amongst other things ) that if the number of @xmath498 ( _ edges _ ) and the number of @xmath499 ( @xmath500 ) contained in a graph are ` what you would expect if the graph was a typical erds ",
    "rnyi random graph with parameter @xmath58 ' , then @xmath16 is quasirandom with parameter @xmath58 ( we refer the reader to  @xcite for a formal definition of quasirandomness )",
    ".    let @xmath491 be sequence of positive real numbers as in the statement of the proposition , and let @xmath501 .",
    "set @xmath495 , and consider a labelled @xmath502-set @xmath503 of vertices from @xmath186,d , p}$ ] .",
    "the probability that @xmath504 forms an edge of the graph is @xmath505 while the probability that all of the edges @xmath504 , @xmath506 , @xmath507 and @xmath508 are present in the graph is @xmath509    we now verify that the numbers of edges @xmath510 and of @xmath502-cycles @xmath511 are concentrated about their respective expectations .",
    "we appeal to the second moment method once more . for the edge @xmath498 we already established that @xmath512 in the proof of theorem  [ binomial s<<d / log d ] .",
    "thus by chebyshev s inequality , we have the required concentration : whp @xmath186,d , p}$ ] contains @xmath513 edges . regarding @xmath502-cycles , we have @xmath514 by using in the second line the fact that @xmath515 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath516 and that the number of @xmath502-cycles in @xmath186,d , p}$ ] is concentrated about its mean : whp @xmath517 our proposition then follows from the quasirandomness theorem of chung , graham and wilson  @xcite .",
    "thus in this case the binomial model behaves like an erds  rnyi random graph .",
    "it is not hard to use this to show that the uniform model with parameter @xmath518 is also quasirandom . as such",
    ", there is nothing very novel about our models in this range .",
    "there are a number of further natural questions to ask about our models .",
    "two such questions concern connectivity and component evolution .",
    "we address these in a forthcoming paper  @xcite , in which we show that the connectivity threshold for the binomial model with @xmath519 is @xmath520 , coinciding with the covering threshold .",
    "on the other hand , for the range @xmath521 we relate the connectivity of the binomial model to that of the uniform model for a suitable choice of parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it remains an open problem to understand independence in the context of subcube intersection graphs .",
    "we do not know how to track the independence number of our models , and more generally we do not know how to perform anything but the most basic computations involving non - edges .",
    "similarly , we have a lower bound on the chromatic number coming from the clique number , but no non - trivial upper bound .",
    "finally , given our motivation for studying subcube intersection graphs , it would be desirable to allow some bias in the distribution of the feature subcubes .",
    "for instance , in a polarised society with two - party politics it is likely citizens will have either mostly zeroes ( ` left - wing opinions ' ) or mostly ones ( ` right - wing opinions ' ) amongst their opinions .",
    "it would then be interesting to study the change in the behaviour of our models as the polarisation becomes stronger .",
