    "inclined air showers are conventionally defined as those arriving at ground with zenith angles @xmath1 above @xmath2 . at large",
    "zenith angles the electromagnetic  ( em ) component in air showers , mainly produced by the decay of @xmath3s , is largely absorbed in the greatly enhanced atmospheric depth the shower needs to cross before reaching ground , so that in a first approximation only the more penetrating particles such as muons survive to ground .",
    "muons are accompanied by an electromagnetic component produced mainly by muon decay in flight and muon interactions such as bremsstrahlung , pair production and nuclear interactions .",
    "a full characterisation of this so - called electromagnetic  halo \" is given in this work .",
    "the study of inclined showers is of great interest because their detection immediately enhances the exposure of existing air shower detectors by up to about @xmath4 with respect to that achieved with vertical showers @xmath5 , extending the field of view to sky directions otherwise inaccessible .",
    "inclined showers have been detected in the past in arrays of ground detectors such as the haverah park  @xcite and agasa  @xcite experiments .",
    "modern detectors such as the pierre auger observatory  @xcite or the telescope array  @xcite can also be used to detect showers with large zenith angles . in particular , the surface detector array ( sd ) of the pierre auger observatory is well suited to detect very inclined showers at energies above about @xmath6 ev , with high efficiency and unprecedented statistical accuracy .",
    "the energy spectrum of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) with inclined showers was recently measured  @xcite .",
    "the surface detector is an extended array of deep water cherenkov detectors that act like volume detectors adequate for recording particles arriving at ground at all zenith angles .    as in all ground arrays ,",
    "the distribution of the detector signals produced by shower particles is used to estimate shower observables such as the primary energy and to perform composition studies . as shown in previous works  @xcite",
    ", the specific characteristics of inclined showers entail that their analysis requires a different approach from the standard one for vertical showers .",
    "the study of the particle densities of the electromagnetic and muonic components at ground level becomes essential in the reconstruction  @xcite and analysis of events at large zenith angles .",
    "inclined showers have also been studied for years for other reasons . in the 70 s , it was suggested that showers induced by neutrinos could be identified in the background of inclined proton or nuclei induced showers by searching for deeply penetrating inclined showers  @xcite which should exhibit a significant electromagnetic component at ground . in this respect",
    "the study and characterisation of the electromagnetic halo in inclined showers is also of great importance .    in this paper",
    "we have used monte carlo generators simulating the air shower development to obtain the particle densities induced by the electromagnetic and muonic components of inclined air showers .",
    "in contrast to other works  @xcite we have performed a comprehensive characterisation of the ratio of the electromagnetic to muonic densities as a function of distance to the shower core for different zenith angles .",
    "we have studied the dependences of this ratio on the primary energy , mass composition and hadronic interaction model assumed in the simulations .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the geomagnetic field that deviates charged particles along their paths to the detector . as a result of this study",
    "we give parameterisations of the average ratio of the em and muonic components as a function of the distance to the shower core , shower zenith angle  ( @xmath1 ) and azimuth angle ( @xmath7 ) of the position at which the particle arrives at ground with respect to the incoming shower direction , as well as on the distance to the shower core in the shower plane  .",
    "the effect of the intrinsic shower - to - shower fluctuations on the electromagnetic and muonic contributions to the density has also been studied .",
    "our results are relevant for the reconstruction of inclined showers in ultra - high energy cosmic ray detectors such as the pierre auger observatory and the telescope array .",
    "we have generated a library of inclined air showers induced by proton and iron primaries using the monte carlo shower propagation code aires 2.6.0  @xcite and the hadronic interaction models qgsjet01  @xcite and sibyll 2.1  @xcite .",
    "showers were generated with energies of 1 , 10 and , with zenith angle ranging from 60@xmath8 to 88@xmath8 in steps of 2@xmath8 and random azimuth angle ( unless otherwise indicated ) .",
    "we have simulated 100 showers for each combination of energy and zenith angle .",
    "showers were simulated with and without geomagnetic field assuming the location of the surface detector of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite ( ground level placed at a depth of @xmath9 ) and using a curved atmosphere based on the linsley s atmospheric model  @xcite .",
    "the number of particles that are produced in an air shower at eev energies and above and the computing time needed to follow all the secondaries is typically excessively large .",
    "to avoid this problem , current air shower simulation codes use a statistical sampling algorithm ( thinning algorithm ) which allows to propagate only a small representative fraction of the total number of particles  @xcite .",
    "statistical weights are assigned to the sampled particles in order to compensate for the rejected ones .",
    "therefore , the output of the air shower simulation is a detailed data file with weighted entries containing the particle information at ground level . in this work",
    ", showers were simulated with a relative thinning level of @xmath10 and a weight factor for the electromagnetic ( heavy ) particles of 12 ( 0.14 ) . since the thinning process itself introduces artificial fluctuations , for the study of the intrinsic shower - to - shower fluctuations we have also simulated sets showers with a thinning level of @xmath11 .",
    "all the particles with kinetic energies above the following thresholds were tracked : 80  kev for electrons , positrons and gammas , 10  mev for muons , 60  mev for mesons and 120  mev for nucleons and nuclei .",
    "since the ground arrays differ in detection thresholds and detector response , we have performed particle energy cuts at ground level corresponding to the particular case of water cherenkov detector thresholds : 264 kev for electrons and positrons , 1.286 mev for gammas and 54.6 mev for muons .",
    "note that the kinetic energy thresholds used in the aires simulations for electromagnetic particles are all below the cherenkov thresholds , implying that we are not artificially eliminating electrons , positrons or photons that could contribute to the electromagnetic densities .",
    "concerning muons , one can see by extrapolating the energy spectrum of muons shown in fig .",
    "[ muonspectrum ] that the number of muons below 10 mev in inclined showers  not accounted for in our aires simulations but still being able to produce electrons above the cherenkov threshold in water  represents a small fraction of the total number of muons .          to calculate the particle densities induced by the electromagnetic and muonic components of the shower",
    ", we perform a simple resampling procedure ( also called _ unthinning _ procedure ) .",
    "the particle density is calculated as the sum of the statistical weights assigned by the thinning algorithm of the particles falling in a sampling region divided by its area .",
    "the sampling area must be large enough so that a significant fraction of particles falls inside it , but at the same time it should be small enough so that particle properties are representative of their expected properties in the particular region of interest  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have chosen two different sampling regions in the plane perpendicular to the incoming shower direction ( shower plane ) .",
    "on the one hand following the previous criterion , , we have considered particles falling in concentric rings with width of 0.08 in @xmath12 in the shower plane to obtain the particle densities as a function of the distance to the shower axis ( lateral density ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we have considered square cells of @xmath13 m@xmath14 in the shower plane when calculating the two dimensional distributions of the particle densities .",
    "the conventional separation between vertical and inclined showers is based on the zenith angle @xmath1 of the arrival direction of the cosmic ray particle that induces the shower .",
    "this separation stems from the different atmospheric grammage that the showers have to cross before reaching the ground , which increases approximately as @xmath15 .",
    "this fact implies that the showers arrive at ground at different stages in their evolution depending on @xmath1 .",
    "a hadronic cosmic ray typically initiates an air shower at the top of the atmosphere in the first few 100 g @xmath16 .",
    "the em component of the shower rises as the shower develops and reaches a maximum at a depth of @xmath17 for a proton shower , close to the total vertical depth of atmosphere for the altitude of the pierre auger observatory .",
    "after @xmath18 , the em component is rapidly absorbed in the atmosphere mainly due to low - energy ionization processes and the photoelectric effect .",
    "meanwhile , non - decaying muons propagate almost unattenuated to the ground , except for ionization energy losses and deflections in the geomagnetic field .",
    "consequently , a shower arriving with @xmath19 reaches the ground shortly after shower maximum and the electromagnetic component dominates at ground .",
    "however , for showers arriving with @xmath20 the atmospheric slant depth increases from @xmath21 to up to more than @xmath22 for completely horizontal showers .",
    "this results in the dominance of the muonic component at ground @xcite accompanied by a small electromagnetic component consisting mainly of the remnant of the electromagnetic shower due to cascading processes from @xmath3 decay of hadronic origin , and the electromagnetic halo due to muon decay in flight and hard muon interactions .",
    "low energy muons ( below a few gev ) typically decay along their paths to the ground generating small electromagnetic subshowers contributing to the particle densities at ground .",
    "this component mimics the muon spatial distribution and is proportional to the muon density @xcite .",
    "hard muon interactions ( pair production , bremsstrahlung and hadronic interactions ) become more and more relevant as muon energy increases . to illustrate when",
    "these processes are expected to contribute larger to the em halo , in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ muonspectrum ] we show the energy spectrum of muons at distances of 30  m and 1000  m to the shower axis for 10 eev proton - induced showers at different zenith angles .",
    "as shown here , these processes are expected to contribute to the em halo especially in highly inclined showers in which most of the muons are typically very energetic ( hundreds of gev ) , because the lower energetic muons typically decay before traveling the enlarged distances from their production height to the ground .",
    "hard muon interactions are also expected to be more frequent close to the shower core where a larger content of energetic muons is expected since energetic muons deviate less from the shower axis .",
    "a vertical shower typically exhibits a symmetric pattern of particle densities around the shower core in the shower plane . in the case of inclined showers",
    "there are several effects that produce an asymmetry on the pattern of particle densities .",
    "the most important sources of which are described below .",
    "muons in inclined showers travel along sufficiently long paths in the atmosphere to be affected by the earth s magnetic field .",
    "positive and negative muons are deviated in opposite directions with respect to the rectilinear trajectories they would follow in the absence of geomagnetic field .             as a consequence",
    "the field distorts the patterns of the muonic densities in the shower plane producing elliptical or even 2-lobed patterns in very inclined showers at ground , an effect extensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "the degree of distortion and the shape of the pattern depend on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the shower axis , namely on the component of the field perpendicular to the shower axis @xmath23 , as well as on the distance traveled by the muons .",
    "this introduces a dependence of the asymmetry on the shower zenith ( @xmath1 ) and azimuth ( @xmath24 ) angles .",
    "as it was shown in  @xcite the effect on the muonic distributions is only significant for @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ compbperp ] we show @xmath23 as a function of @xmath24 for the particular location of the southern pierre auger observatory site . for a given zenith angle , the distortion is expected to be maximal close to @xmath26 and @xmath27 and minimal around @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 points eastwards and is oriented counterclockwise .    as an example of the effect of the geomagnetic field on the particle densities , in fig .",
    "[ muonmapwithandnob ] we show 2-dimensional maps of the muonic and electromagnetic particle densities in the shower plane in a eev proton induced shower arriving at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with ( right ) and without ( left ) the geomagnetic field induced .",
    "the distortion of the cylindrical symmetry of the muonic component is apparent , and since the electromagnetic halo preserves the spatial distribution of muons in inclined showers , the pattern of the electromagnetic particle density exhibits a shape similar to the muonic one , although slightly blurred due to multiple coulomb scatterings suffered by the electrons before reaching ground .",
    "besides the asymmetries induced by the geomagnetic field , there is also an azimuthal asymmetry in the muonic and electromagnetic particle densities due to the combination of geometrical and shower evolution effects  @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ asymschema ] shower particles do not travel parallel to the shower axis in general and therefore they cross different amounts of atmospheric depth before reaching ground .",
    "the crossed depth depends on the azimuthal angle ( @xmath7 ) of the position on the ground at which the particle arrives with respect to the incoming shower direction .",
    "in particular , particles arrive at the ground in the _ early _ region of the shower ( the portion of the shower front that hits the ground first corresponding to @xmath32 ) more vertically than those in the _ late _ region ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is essentially the basis for the geometrical effect , which depends strongly on the specific characteristics of the detectors sampling the shower front .",
    "the asymmetry induced by the geometrical effect is typically small in showers with high zenith angles .",
    "the more inclined a shower , the more energetic the muons arriving at ground are and hence the smaller the difference in the arrival angle distributions between the early and late regions of the shower .",
    "the asymmetry induced by the shower evolution can be understood as follows .",
    "particles at the same distance to the shower axis in the shower plane , but arriving with different azimuthal angles @xmath7 travel along different paths , and belong to different stages in the evolution of the shower .",
    "the importance of this effect depends on the evolution of the lateral particle distribution and on the attenuation of the total number of particles with the atmospheric depth . in fig .",
    "[ asymschema ] the detector in the early region of the shower is hit by a younger stage in the evolution of the shower than the detector in the late region .",
    "more quantitatively , for instance in a 10 eev proton shower at @xmath34 , there is a difference of @xmath35 g @xmath16 ( for notation see fig .",
    "[ asymschema ] ) between the atmosphere crossed by particles produced at the same height , traveling in straight line and hitting the ground in the late and early regions at a distance @xmath36 m to the core in the shower plane .",
    "this difference increases with the distance from the shower core .",
    "the asymmetry induced by the evolution of the shower affects more the electromagnetic component produced by @xmath37 decay than the muonic component or its associated electromagnetic halo .",
    "the reason is that this component is exponentially suppressed after the shower maximum , and small variations of the depth crossed by the shower induce large differences in the number of electromagnetic particles on the ground .",
    "however , the muonic component is less attenuated and therefore the asymmetry induced by this effect is smaller . as a consequence",
    ", shower evolution is expected to induce a much smaller asymmetry in the density in showers with zenith angles @xmath38 , because the electromagnetic component from @xmath37 decay is practically suppressed , and the electromagnetic halo is simply following the pattern of the muonic component where the asymmetry is small .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ asymdensit ] where we plot the relative difference between the electromagnetic and muonic particle densities in the early ( @xmath39 ) and late ( @xmath40 ) regions in the shower plane as obtained in our simulations . for the moment",
    "the geomagnetic field effect is neglected in this study . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ asymdensit ] it can be seen that for showers at @xmath34 the difference in the electromagnetic density between the early and the late regions is very large even at small distances to the core ( for example a factor 1.2 at @xmath41 100 m ) , because the electromagnetic component from @xmath37 decay is still significant in the early region , and it is significantly absorbed before reaching ground in the late region .",
    "this difference increases steeply with distance @xmath42 .",
    "however , at @xmath43 the difference between the densities in the early and late regions is smaller , because the electromagnetic component from @xmath37 decay is absorbed at all @xmath7 and only the electromagnetic halo remains , except for at very far distances from the core",
    "where , besides inheriting the already quite large asymmetry due to the muonic component , there is still some remnant of the electromagnetic shower present in the early region but not in the late one .",
    "this explains why the early - late asymmetry follows essentially the behaviour of the corresponding muonic density ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ asymdensit ] ) . in the muonic case ,",
    "the relative difference between the early and late densities is always small regardless of zenith angle .",
    "the electromagnetic and muonic particle densities have a characteristic behaviour with distance to the shower axis , shower zenith angle and azimuthal position with respect to the incoming shower direction .",
    "also the different contributions to the electromagnetic particle densities differ from each other as will be shown below .",
    "firstly , we have studied the em and muon number densities as a function of the distance to the shower axis ( lateral distributions ) in 10 eev proton - induced showers at different zenith angles , averaging over the azimuthal angle @xmath7 on the ground .",
    "we have also parameterised the lateral distributions of the particle densities as a function of shower zenith angle for practical applications , using 10 eev proton showers simulated with the hadronic model qgsjet01 as reference .",
    "these parameterisations are presented in appendix a. the results from these parameterisations are shown as solid lines in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ emmusignal ] compared to the simulations .",
    "the simulations are reproduced by the fits without significant deviations as shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ emmusignal ] ( @xmath44 for muons and @xmath45 for the em component ) .      as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ emmusignal ] , the muonic density @xmath46 decreases with @xmath1 , because muons need to travel larger distances before reaching ground arriving at larger distances to the core and being spread over a larger area .",
    "this is mainly due to the transverse momentum inherited from its parent hadron .",
    "muons of the lowest energies typically decay , decreasing further the density with theta , especially at large distances .",
    "both effects also explain the behaviour of the muon energy distribution with @xmath1 and distance to the shower axis shown in fig .",
    "[ muonspectrum ] .",
    "for example , in the right panel of this figure one can see that the mean muon energy increases with @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath42 , because only the more energetic muons survive and besides , these deviate more from the shower axis .",
    "the behaviour of the electromagnetic lateral distribution in inclined showers ( right panel of fig .  [ emmusignal ] ) , can be qualitatively understood as a combination of the different behaviour of the two contributions to the em component namely , that produced by @xmath3 decay ( from hadronic origin ) and the electromagnetic halo ( from muonic origin ) .",
    "separating the two main contributions to the total em density is not possible in aires simulations because the information on the mother particle ( a @xmath3 or a muon ) producing the em subshower is lost .",
    "however we have devised a procedure to obtain in an approximate way the various contributions to the total em density .",
    "the total em density @xmath47 can be obtained as :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the em density due to decay of @xmath3s produced in hadron and meson interactions , @xmath50 is the em density due to muon decay and @xmath51 is the em density due to muon bremsstrahlung , pair production and nuclear interactions . using aires",
    "we have performed a special subset of shower simulations in which we artificially set the muon energy threshold above which muons are explicitly followed in the simulations to a very high energy ( 10 tev ) , and at the same time we set the muon lifetime to infinity so that muons never decay .",
    "the last condition needs to be forced otherwise muons are artificially decayed in aires .",
    "the em density obtained in this way has no contribution from muons ( i.e. @xmath52 ) and can only be generated in @xmath3 decays ( produced in hadron and meson interactions ) . in fig .",
    "[ emremnant ] we show the lateral distribution of the em density as obtained in these simulations for different zenith angles .",
    "it can be seen that as the zenith angle increases from @xmath2 the em density due to @xmath3 decay is increasingly absorbed , until the zenith angle reaches @xmath53 and it practically disappears , except for a small contribution still reaching ground very near the core at @xmath54 m and far from it at @xmath55 km reaching only the early region of the shower .    for @xmath38 the em component from @xmath37 decay is negligible and the em halo dominates at essentially all distances to the core .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the em lateral distribution follows the behaviour of the muonic one .",
    "this is more apparent in fig .",
    "[ emmuratio ] where the ratio of the electromagnetic and muonic densities is shown .",
    "note that the results shown in this figure are obtained with standard aires simulations .",
    "we have also studied the behaviour of the ratio of the electromagnetic to the muonic densities :    @xmath56         in fig .",
    "[ emmuratio ] , we show @xmath57 averaged over azimuth angle @xmath7 as a function of the distance to the core @xmath42 for different shower zenith angles @xmath1 and as a function of the @xmath1 for different fixed distances as obtained in the simulations , and the ratio predicted by the parameterisations proposed in appendix a. near the core , the ratio decreases with zenith angle from @xmath58 to @xmath59 due to the increasing absorption of the em component from @xmath3 decay , and then increases again with @xmath1 as can be seen in fig",
    ".  [ emmuratio ] , mainly due to muon hard interactions processes that are expected to dominate near the core in very inclined showers .",
    "far from the core the lateral distribution of the ratio tends to flatten due to the dominant contribution of the em halo produced by muon decay in flight .",
    "the larger the zenith angle , the closer to shower core the ratio levels off .",
    "the slight increase of the ratio for @xmath60 and far from the core ( @xmath61 km ) is attributed to the combination of two effects , one is that the number of low energy muons decreases more rapidly at large distances because they decay before reaching the ground , and only energetic muons survive , and on the other hand the presence of the contribution to the em density due to @xmath3 decay , particularly in the early region of the shower .",
    "in addition to the dependence on zenith angle and distance to shower core , we have also studied the azimuthal asymmetry of @xmath62 . for the moment the effect of the geomagnetic field is neglected .         in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ratiomap ] , we show the 2-dimensional map of the ratio @xmath57 in the shower plane for 10 eev proton showers at @xmath34 . the shower incoming direction is from east to west in the figure .",
    "as expected , there is a clear azimuthal asymmetry at a fixed distance to the core .",
    "the contribution of the electromagnetic component is larger in the early region .",
    "however , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ratiomap ] , at zenith angles @xmath63 the azimuthal asymmetry is less significant because only muons accompanied by the electromagnetic halo arrive at ground . since these two components approximately have the same asymmetry ( section 3.1.2 ) , the final asymmetry is practically canceled out when making their ratio .",
    "to study further the azimuthal dependence of the asymmetry we divide the shower plane in bins of width @xmath64 centered around @xmath7 , and we calculate the lateral distributions of the ratio in each bin for a fixed zenith angle : @xmath65 , and we compare these distributions to the distribution @xmath66 obtained averaging over @xmath7 .",
    "for this purpose we define the asymmetry parameter @xmath67 as    @xmath68    in fig .",
    "[ exampleasyemmuratio ] , we show the lateral distribution of @xmath57 in different @xmath7 bins compared to the mean value ( left panel ) and their corresponding asymmetry parameter @xmath67 ( right panel ) for showers at @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath69 increases with distance to the core and it is larger in the early region than in the late region as expected .",
    "in addition to the dependence on position in the shower plane ( @xmath70 ) , the asymmetry parameter @xmath67 also depends on the shower zenith angle . in fig .",
    "[ amplitudeasy ] we show @xmath67 as a function of @xmath7 for a fixed distance @xmath71 m and different zenith angles .",
    "the amplitude of the asymmetry decreases as the zenith angle increases for the reasons explained above .",
    "this plot illustrates the importance of accounting for the asymmetry in the ratio when dealing with inclined showers with @xmath72 .",
    "we have parameterised the asymmetry @xmath67 as a function of the distance to the core , zenith angle and the azimuthal angle @xmath7 accounting for all the dependences above ( see appendix b ) . as an example",
    ", we show the results of the fit as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ exampleasyemmuratio ] .",
    "the simulations are reproduced by the fit without significant deviations as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ exampleasyemmuratio ] . in the parameterisation",
    ", we have assumed that the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath73 is negligible when @xmath74 .      as discussed before ( section 3.1.1 ) ,",
    "the muon distributions are distorted by the presence of the geomagnetic field for zenith angles greater than @xmath75 .                 at these angles ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the electromagnetic component at ground is due to the electromagnetic halo , which inherits the muon spatial distribution and is proportional to the muonic density , and we expect the ratio of the electromagnetic to muonic densities to maintain the symmetry in the azimuthal angle @xmath7 .",
    "for this reason , we have only studied the effect of the geomagnetic field on the ratio averaging over the azimuthal angle @xmath7 in the shower plane , for different shower zenith @xmath1 and azimuth @xmath24 angles .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath1 we study the extreme cases where the effect is minimal , @xmath76 , and maximal , @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) , where @xmath24 is defined as in fig .",
    "[ compbperp ] . in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ beffratio ] we show the lateral behaviour of @xmath57 in the presence of the geomagnetic field for 10 eev proton showers .",
    "we also plot the relative difference between @xmath62 with and without geomagnetic field effect , namely :    @xmath79    as can be seen in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ beffratio ] , the effect of the geomagnetic field on @xmath57 is more important near the core at all zenith angles .",
    "the reason for this is that only the highest energy muons are not significantly deflected and stay close to the core , and these are more likely to suffer hard interactions and induce an electromagnetic shower . as a consequence @xmath47 increases and at the same time @xmath80 decreases because lower energy muons are being deflected away from the core .",
    "these two effects produce an overall increase in @xmath57 .",
    "this increase is small for @xmath81 and @xmath82 m , with @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath84 the effect starts to be important in the case of maximal deviation ( @xmath85 ) where @xmath86 for @xmath87 m , whereas for the case of minimal expected deviation ( @xmath31 ) the relative difference remains smaller at all distances . at larger angles",
    "@xmath88 , the geomagnetic field has a strong influence on @xmath57 , even when @xmath89 and the effect is expected to be minimal .",
    "it can also be seen that the larger the zenith angle , the farther from the shower core the influence of the geomagnetic field is still important for the reasons explained before .    in conclusion",
    ", the effect of the geomagnetic field on the ratio of the electromagnetic to muonic number densities can be considered relevant for showers at @xmath90 .",
    "it should be noted that the rate of events at such high zenith angles detected at ground level by an array of detectors is small due to the reduced solid angle and the small size of the projection of the array onto the direction of the shower , so that this effect can be ignored for the purposes of data analysis in a first approximation .",
    "in this section we study the dependence of @xmath57 on primary energy , mass of the primary cosmic ray initiating the shower , and hadronic interaction model used to perform the simulations .",
    "these dependences are studied neglecting the effect of the geomagnetic field and averaging over azimuthal angle @xmath7 in the shower plane .      the more energetic a shower , its maximum occurs deeper in the atmosphere , and therefore , the shower components are in a younger stage of evolution .",
    "the lateral distribution of the electromagnetic and muonic densities exhibits a characteristic behaviour with energy and depth of shower maximum  @xcite .",
    "the lateral distribution of the charged electromagnetic component due to the cascading processes ( mainly due to @xmath3 decay ) is approximately given by , @xmath91 where the total number of particles @xmath92 depends on primary energy @xmath93 as @xmath94 . at shower maximum , @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "the lateral behaviour of the electromagnetic component @xmath96 depends on shower age ( @xmath97 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lateral distribution of muons can be expressed as :    @xmath98    where the total number of muons @xmath99 ( with @xmath100 ) increases slower with the energy than the electromagnetic component @xcite .",
    "also the lateral behaviour @xmath101 is approximately independent of the shower age  @xcite .",
    "finally , as discussed before , the electromagnetic component due to muon decay in flight is proportional to the muonic density .",
    "hence , the lateral distribution of this component is expected to have the same energy dependence as the muonic one .    combining all these facts",
    ", we expect the ratio @xmath102 to have a different behaviour depending on whether the electromagnetic component due to @xmath3 decay or the em halo contributes more to the total electromagnetic density .",
    "we study the energy dependence of @xmath57 performing the relative difference between the ratio at a given energy with respect to that obtained for 10 eev proton showers , @xmath103 ( see previous section ) :    @xmath104    in fig .",
