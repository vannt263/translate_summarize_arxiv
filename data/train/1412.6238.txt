    "with the rapid development of the materia and aviation technology , the transport mechanism of interfacial thermodynamics under microgravity / zero gravity or in microfluidic system is one of the hot topics in space science . in the microgravity environment or the microfluidic devices , the effect of gravity",
    "is greatly eliminated or even disappeared , then different transports of the interface dynamics are emerged .",
    "when the system has a nonuniform temperature distribution , there has a temperature gradient along the interface , which caused to a variation of the surface tension along the interface ( the surface tension generally decreases with the increased temperature for most fluids ) .",
    "this variable surface tension force could lead to a viscous stress , which could induce the fluid s motion from a hotter region to a colder region .",
    "this phenomena is known as thermocapillary ( marangoni ) convection , which plays a dominant role in microgravity @xcite or microfluidic devices @xcite .    as one of the interesting investigations of the thermocaplliary convection",
    ", the migration of an unconfined spherical droplet / bubble has been investigated extensively @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , young et al first derived an analytical formulation for the terminal velocity of unconfined non deformable drop with a linear temperature profile in the creeping flow limit . since then , there have been numerous subsequent experimental or numerical studies to investigate such phenomenon @xcite .",
    "as we known , experimental investigations of the thermocapillary migration of droplet / bubble are hampered by gravitational effects which tend to mask the thermocapillary effect on terrestrial .",
    "to reduce such effects , the drop tower , sounding rockets , and aboard space shuttles are the basic ways to get a short time microgravity environment for investigating thermocapillary convection , while a long time microgravity experiment in space station is an expensive and crucial way , which depended on the aviation program in the whole world @xcite .",
    "although experimental investigations could help to understand the phenomena of thermocapillary flows in microgravity / microfluidic devices , it is still difficult to precisely measure the local temperature and flow fields during the transport process of a droplet / bubble .",
    "on the other hand , numerical method has been viewed as a scientific method for the fluid dynamics , which has been successfully applied to the thermocapillary flows @xcite . however , an efficient and precise description of phase interaction or its interfacial dynamics model is still a challenging task . in literature",
    ", there are generally two clarifications of numerical methods for simulating thermocapillary flow : one is single phase navier - stokes equations ( nse ) based numerical method @xcite ; another is the two phase nse based numerical method @xcite . in the former method ,",
    "the physical problem is mainly focused on dynamics of one phase , and the thermocapillary effect is entreatment through the interface boundary conditions , which is usually used to some simplified thermocapillary convection problems . in the latter one",
    ", the detailed physical phenomena of the interface dynamics in both phases could be observed , and there is no need to implement the interface boundary conditions throughout the computation except for the sharp interface method .",
    "it is well understood that the interface dynamics of the two phase flow is just the result of molecular interactions between different phases .",
    "thus , if we could design a model that could correctly description of such interaction process at microscopic level , the corresponding interface dynamics could be obtained at macroscopic level . the lattice boltzmann method ( lbe )",
    "is just one of the mesoscopic methods , which could be applied to model such interaction process @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend previous continuous surface force ( csf ) lbe to the thermocapillary flow , and the effect of the marangoni force is included through the csf formulation .",
    "the evolution of interface is governed by the cahn - hilliard equation ( che ) , which is solved by lbe , and a thermal lbe is derived from the kinetic theory for solving the scalar convection - diffusion energy equation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec ii , a continuous surface force formulation of lbe model",
    "is presented , and a lbe model for temperature field is proposed in sec .",
    "iii , then some numerical simulations are conducted to validate the models in sec .",
    "iv , and finally a brief conclusion is given in sec .",
    "in general , surface tension is a function of local temperature in thermal multiphase system , so the effect of tangential gradient of the surface tension should be included in the csf formulation , and the governing equation for the momentum could be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fluid density , @xmath2 is the velocity , @xmath3 is the hydrodynamic pressure , @xmath4 is the viscous stress term and the interface force @xmath5 in eq .",

    "<S> in this paper , we extend a lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) with continuous surface fore ( csf ) to simulate thermocapillary flows . </S>",
    "<S> the model is designed on our previous csf lbe for athermal two phase flow , in which the interfacial tension forces and the marangoni stresses as the results of the interface interactions between different phases are described by a conception of csf . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the sharp interfaces between different phases are separated by a narrow transition layers , and the kinetics and morphology evolution of phase separation would be characterized by an order parameter visa cahn - hilliard equation which is solved in the frame work of lbe . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar convection - diffusion equation for temperature field is also solved by thermal lbe . </S>",
    "<S> the models are validated by thermal two layered poiseuille flow , and a two superimposed planar fluids at negligibly small reynolds and marangoni numbers for the thermocapillary driven convection , which have analytical solutions for the velocity and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> then thermocapillary migration of two dimensional deformable droplet are simulated . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that the predictions of present lbe agreed with the analytical solution / other numerical results . </S>"
