    "the transmission of quantum information is a central problem in quantum information theory , and a great deal of attention has been devoted to understanding noisy quantum channels , of which the simplest kind is defined in sec .",
    "[ sbct2.1 ] . of particular interest is finding the asymptotic quantum capacity @xmath0 of such a channel , a task which is much more difficult than its analog in classical information theory .",
    "the asymptotic capacity of a classical channel is equal to the mutual information between the channel s input and output ( see ch .  7 in @xcite ) , maximized over all possible probability distributions for the input . because the mutual information is a concave function of the input probability distribution , this quantity is easily computed numerically if a closed - form expression is not available .",
    "in addition the classical capacity is additive : the capacity of two independent channels used in parallel is just the sum of the individual capacities .",
    "a quantum analog of the classical mutual information is the coherent information , and finding its maximum over all possible input density operators yields the _ one - shot quantum capacity _ @xmath1 ( sometimes also called the coherent information ) of the channel ( see ch .  13 in @xcite ) . but unlike its classical counterpart , the coherent information need not be a concave function of the input density operator , and @xmath1 is in general not additive for two channels placed in parallel",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sbct2.2 ] for additional remarks . )",
    "however , devetak and shor @xcite showed that @xmath1 is additive for any two ( not necessarily identical ) _ degradable _ quantum channels ( see the definition in sec .",
    "[ sbct2.3 ] ) placed in parallel . from this it follows that @xmath2 for a degradable channel , and @xmath0 for two such channels placed in parallel is the sum of its values for the individual channels .",
    "in addition , the coherent information of a degradable channel is a concave function of the input density operator  @xcite , allowing @xmath1 to be computed efficiently . in this respect",
    "the quantum capacity problem for degradable quantum channels resembles that of classical channels .",
    "however , checking whether a given quantum channel is or is not degradable is not altogether straightforward , and while several interesting classes of degradable channels are known @xcite the full limits of this family of channels have not been established .",
    "very little is known about the asymptotic capacities of quantum channels which are not degradable .",
    "cases are known for which @xmath1 and @xmath0 are not additive ; one of the most striking @xcite is a pair of channels both of which have asymptotic capacities @xmath0 equal to zero , but when placed in parallel have a finite @xmath1 , and thus a nonzero asymptotic @xmath0 .",
    "various upper and lower bounds on capacities of nondegradable channels are known ",
    "some obtained using a clever construction involving degradable channels @xcite  but at present the source of nonadditivity is not understood .",
    "one may hope that a better understanding of degradable channels , including what happens when degradability breaks down upon variation of some parameter , may provide useful insights .    in this article",

    "indeed , by including subchannels ( which use a subspace of the channel entrance ) , and continuous limits , as illustrated in some examples in sec .",
    "[ sct4 ] , it seems possible to provide pcubed constructions for many of the degradable channels discussed in @xcite , although we have not studied every case found in that very useful paper .",
    "not all pcubed channels are degradable , and it is easy to construct examples in which a continuous variation of a parameter leads from a degradable to a nondegradable channel , thus allowing a study of what happens when the pleasant properties associated with degradability are lost .",

    "the pcubed construction is in effect what chefles and his collaborators used when considering the problem of quantum channels that map certain sets of pure states to other sets of pure states @xcite . and",

    "[ sbct3.2 ] , with the _ twisted diagonal _ construction used by wolf and prez - garca @xcite in their study of degradable channels .",
    "the main way our work differs from previous studies is in focusing on the isometry which generates a channel superoperator , rather than on the superoperator itself .",
    "the two are formally equivalent , but sometimes the isometry is easier to understand ; in particular when studying degradable channels , but perhaps in other cases as well .",
    "the remainder of this article is structured as follows .",

    "section  [ sct5 ] , with some details in the appendix , presents results for a particular qutrit channel in which a continuous variation of parameters leads out of a degradable regime , and certain properties associated with a degradable channel break down .",
    "section  [ sct6 ] summarizes the paper .",
    "a noisy quantum channel , also called a quantum operation , can be constructed starting with a unitary operator @xmath3 , representing the time development of a closed quantum system , that carries @xmath4 to @xmath5 , where the hilbert space @xmath6 represents the _ channel entrance _ , @xmath7 the environment , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 the _ direct _ and _ complementary _ channel outputs .",
    "one often equates @xmath8 with @xmath6 and @xmath9 with @xmath7 , i.e. , the complementary output is the environment , but greater generality is possible if one allows the dimensions of @xmath6 and @xmath8 to be different",
    ". if the environment is always in the same initial state @xmath10 ( a mixed state of the environment can always be purified ) , its action on the states in @xmath6 can be represented by an _ isometry _",
    "@xmath11 our discussion is based on this isometry , and assumes the three hilbert spaces have ( finite ) dimensions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which can be arbitrary except for the requirement @xmath15 , which is necessary for @xmath16 to be an isometry , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "the isometry then produces two quantum channels represented by the superoperators @xmath18 carrying the space @xmath19 of operators on @xmath6 , of which @xmath20 is a typical example , into the operator spaces @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "it is customary to refer to @xmath23 as the _ complement _ of @xmath24 , with @xmath24 the complement of @xmath23 , so a single isometry produces a complementary pair of channels .",
    "the fact that @xmath16 is an isometry implies that @xmath24 and @xmath23 are _ completely positive and trace preserving _ ( cptp ) ; conversely , any cptp map can be produced in this way starting with a suitable isometry .",
    "one way to represent the map @xmath24 is to use kraus operators @xmath25 which define the isometry @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath9 .",
    "of course a similar representation is possible for @xmath23 , with kraus operators mapping @xmath6 to @xmath9 .",
    "the isometry @xmath16 maps the channel entrance @xmath6 onto a subspace of @xmath5 , and this _ image subspace _ determines the properties of the channel pair up to a unitary on @xmath6 ; i.e. , if an isometry @xmath28 has the same image subspace as @xmath16 , then @xmath29 for some unitary @xmath3 on @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath16 itself is restricted to a subspace of @xmath6 , then it is ( obviously ) again an isometry acting on this restriction , and produces a pair of channels which we will refer to as _ subchannels _ of the original channels ; equivalently , these subchannels are associated with a subspace of the original image subspace on @xmath5 .",
    "two quantum channels @xmath30 and @xmath31 are said to be `` in parallel '' or `` used simultaneously '' or `` used independently '' if together they constitute a single channel @xmath24 defined as follows .",
    "if @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the isometries that lead to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , let @xmath34 be the map from @xmath35 to @xmath36 @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , defined in the obvious way :    @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath38 , defined in the obvious way : @xmath42 then @xmath43 as defined in for @xmath16 in is what we mean by @xmath30 and @xmath31 in parallel , and of course its complement @xmath23 is @xmath44 and @xmath45 in parallel .",
    "the definition extends in an obvious way to three or more channels in parallel .",
    "the _ coherent information _ or _ entropy bias _ of a channel @xmath24 with complementary channel @xmath23 is defined by the formula @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the input density operator , a positive operator with trace equal to 1 , and @xmath48 is the von neumann entropy . the _ one - shot quantum capacity _ , also known ( somewhat confusingly ) as the _ coherent information of the channel _ is defined by the formula @xmath49 where the maximum is taken over all density operators in @xmath19 .",
    "the one - shot capacity for the @xmath23 channel can be written as @xmath50 the one shot capacity is superadditive , meaning that for channels @xmath30 and @xmath31 in parallel , @xmath51 the ( asymptotic ) quantum capacity @xmath52 @xcite is equal to @xmath53 and thus in light of is bounded below by @xmath54 .",
    "one of the channels in a pair produced by an isometry is said to be _ degradable _",
    "@xcite if its output can be sent through another noisy channel in such a way that the combination is equivalent to the other , complementary , channel in the pair , which is then said to be _",
    "antidegradable_. we shall also refer to a _ degradable pair _ of channels , and in addition use the term _ undegradable _ to refer to either a single channel or a complementary pair in a situation in which the channel is neither degradable nor antidegradable , and thus the same is true of the complementary channel .",
    "in particular , the @xmath55 channel of sec .  [ sct2 ] , with superoperator @xmath24 defined in is degradable if there is an additional isometry @xmath56 giving rise to a superoperator @xmath57 with the property that , for @xmath23 defined in , @xmath58 the ancillary space @xmath59 plays no further role in the definition of degradability .",
    "one can also think of @xmath60 as mapping to a new hilbert space @xmath61 isomorphic to @xmath9 , but the simplest statement of the degradability condition uses @xmath9 .",
    "note that it is possible for a channel to be simultaneously degradable and antidegradable , in which case its complement is also both degradable and antidegradable .",
    "if two degradable channels @xmath30 and @xmath31 are placed in parallel , the combined channel @xmath62 is again degradable , and in addition the inequality becomes an equality @xcite .",
    "this has the consequence that for any degradable channel @xmath24 the asymptotic capacity @xmath52 is equal to @xmath54 , and if both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are degradable , @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "in addition @xmath65 , , is a concave function of @xmath47 when @xmath24 is degradable @xcite , so its maximum @xmath1 is relatively easy to calculate . as a consequence , quantum capacities of degradable channels",
    "inherit some of the nice properties of shannon capacities of classical noisy channels .      a quantum channel @xmath24 with complement @xmath23",
    "is said to be _ conjugate degradable _",
    "@xcite provided there is a cptp map @xmath66 from @xmath21 to @xmath22 such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a superoperator defined by choosing a particular orthonormal basis @xmath69 of @xmath9 , and for any operator @xmath70 defining @xmath71 as the operator whose matrix is related to that of @xmath72 by a transpose : @xmath73 a channel can be both degradable and conjugate degradable if both and are satisfied , which will in general require distinct maps @xmath74 and @xmath66 .",
    "one can also define conjugate degradability by replacing @xmath68 in with a complex conjugation operator @xmath75 , defining @xmath76 to be the operator such that @xmath77 note that @xmath75 is an antilinear operator , and for this reason with @xmath75 in place of @xmath68 is only required to hold for hermitian operators @xmath78 , which of course includes density operators . because @xmath68 is linear , if holds for hermitian operators it also holds for all operators in @xmath19 .",
    "both @xmath68 and @xmath75 are defined for a particular orthonormal basis of @xmath9 , but the basis dependence is of no importance for the present discussion ; if a different basis is used , one only needs to adjust @xmath23 and @xmath66 by applying a suitable unitary ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) to their outputs , and will again be satisfied .    at present",
    "it is not known if there are channels which are conjugate degradable but not degradable .",

    "we generally assume that the @xmath80 are linearly independent , and thus form a ( in general not orthonormal ) basis of @xmath6 , so @xmath91 ; and also that @xmath92 , though the @xmath82 and @xmath83 need not span @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "<S> we consider a family of quantum channels characterized by the fact that certain ( in general nonorthogonal ) pure states at the channel entrance are mapped to ( tensor ) products of pure states ( ppp , hence `` pcubed '' ) at the complementary outputs ( the main output and the `` environment '' ) of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> the pcubed construction , a reformulation of the twisted - diagonal procedure in @xcite , can be used to produce a large class of degradable quantum channels ; degradable channels are of interest because their quantum capacities are easy to calculate . </S>",
    "<S> several known types of degradable channels are either pcubed channels , or subchannels ( employing a subspace of the channel entrance ) , or continuous limits of pcubed channels . </S>",
    "<S> the pcubed construction also yields channels which are neither degradable nor antidegradable ( i.e. , the complement of a degradable channel ) ; a particular example of a qutrit channel of this type is studied in some detail . </S>",
    "<S> determining whether a pcubed channel is degradable or antidegradable or neither is quite straightforward given the pure input and output states that characterize the channel . </S>",
    "<S> conjugate degradable pcubed channels are always degradable . </S>"
