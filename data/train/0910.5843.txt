    "dust lanes in galactic bars have been observed in nearby galaxies for a long time .",
    "photographic surveys from the beginning of 20@xmath3 century already allowed observation of these features .",
    "pease ( 1917 ) describes the prominent and nearly straight dust lanes in ngc  5383 as a ` dark streak ' .",
    "the same paper presents images of ngc  1068 in which a dust lane is clearly visible .",
    "the dusty nature of these features was identified at a much later stage .",
    "sandage ( 1961 ) writes in his atlas that one of the major characteristics of the sbb(s ) [ galaxies ] is the presence of two dust lanes leaving the nucleus , one on each side of the bar and extending into the spiral arms.    dust lanes have been recognised as related to shocks in the gas flow in barred galaxies since prendergast ( 1962 ) .",
    "such shocks are usually found in the leading edge of the bar , roughly parallel to its major axis .",
    "the location of these shocks also corresponds to the location of areas of high shear , which prevents star formation ( athanassoula 1992 ; see zurita et al .",
    "2004 for a graphic illustration in the case of ngc  1530 ) .",
    "simulations show that the dust lanes are nearly straight and near the center of the bar when the galaxy has no inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , which is known to be quite a rare occurrence .",
    "ilrs cause the dust lanes to be offset from the bar major axis , and to be curved with the concavity pointing to the bar major axis ( athanassoula 1992 ) .",
    "simulations by patsis & athanassoula ( 2000 ) show that the higher the gas sound speed , the smaller is the offset between the dust lane and the major axis of the bar .",
    "no dust lanes are expected in nuclear bars ( shlosman & heller 2002 ) .",
    "athanassoula ( 1992 ) predicted from simulations that dust lanes would have a greater curvature in weaker bars and that dust lanes would be nearly straight in strong bars .",
    "this effect has been empirically verified using a set of images of nine barred spiral galaxies by knapen et al .",
    "the aim of the present letter is to improve the statistics compared to the latter study , and to test definitively the prediction from athanassoula ( 1992 ) . because dust lanes can be observed so",
    "easily they offer a fundamental handle on the underlying dynamics of the galaxy and the bar , yet they have hardly been studied observationally . a basic further aim of the present work is thus to explore in a statistical fashion the dependence of dust lane shape on the dynamical properties of the galaxy which hosts them .",
    "we have selected all galaxies with a published non - axisymmetric maximum torque parameter for the bar , @xmath0 , and a published radius at which @xmath0 has been measured , @xmath1 .",
    "its definition and the values for 266 different galaxies can be found in laurikainen & salo ( 2002 ) ; block et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , laurikainen el al .",
    "( 2004 ) , laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and comern et al .",
    "some of these authors publish @xmath4 , which includes the non - axisymmetries not related to the bars ( but to spiral arms ) .",
    "however , @xmath4 and @xmath0 take very similar values in barred galaxies and can be interchanged for our purposes . in several cases",
    "@xmath0 has been reported in more than one paper , in which cases we have used the most recent measurement ( except for those in comern et al .",
    "2009 which are based on shallower images ) .",
    "for ngc  1068 we preferred the value from comern et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to that from laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) because in the latter the authors measure @xmath0 of the nuclear bar , whereas the dust lanes are hosted by the large bar .",
    "there are small variations in the techniques used to determine @xmath0 in the various articles quoted above but we have checked that the @xmath0 determinations are consistent within the error bars .",
    "these technical differences cause some scatter in the @xmath0 measurements .",
    "the most important source of scatter is the use of different vertical scale - heights when measuring @xmath0 and the large scatter in the observed vertical scale - height within one single hubble type . for a detailed discussion see laurikainen & salo ( 2002 ) , where the authors consider that the uncertainties in both the orientation parameters and in the disc scale - height determination may cause an error of up to 10 - 15% in @xmath0 .",
    "as we are mixing data from several sources we take a slightly higher estimate for the overall uncertainty in our @xmath0 values of 20% .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the observational part of our study confirms that the degree of curvature of dust lanes decreases with increasing bar strength , i.e.  stronger bars have straighter dust lanes ( fig .",
    "[ qbs ] ) .",
    "this was predicted by athanassoula ( 1992 ) and confirmed in a preliminary way from observations of nine galaxies by knapen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . here , we find that the relation , in fact , outlines an upper limit to the dust lane curvature allowed for a particular value of @xmath0 , in the sense that a bar with low @xmath0 can have either straight or curved dust lanes , but bars with high @xmath0 can only have straight dust lanes .",
    "we performed a series of numerical simulations to explore which parameters may be at the origin of the spread of the data points in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ simul ] .",
    "we tested whether this spread is caused by different bulge masses , different galaxy masses inside the corotation , and different bar pattern speeds .",
    "we find no effect of these parameters on the spread except for the bar pattern speed : the spread for slow bars is higher but this effect is quite small .",
    "we found , however , that the data can be organized in a plot with much smaller spread by fitting the logarithm of the dust lane curvature to a linear combination of @xmath0 and @xmath2 which are parameters that depend only on bar properties .",
    "the best fit is @xmath5 and it is represented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ simul ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient of the fit is @xmath6 , better than when just fitting @xmath0 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this fit shows that @xmath0 overestimates the effect of the bar ellipticity on the dust lane curvature .",
    "the correlation between the linear combination of @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the logarithm of @xmath9 can not yet be easily tested with observational data .",
    "measuring the ellipticity of the bar requires an accurate decomposition of high quality images of the galaxy into its different components .",
    "further work is needed in order to obtain these decompositions and refine the comparison with the simulations .",
    "using 55 galaxies with published measurements of the bar strength indicator @xmath0 , and for which we could obtain accurate measurements of the dust lane curvature , @xmath9 , we confirm the theoretical prediction made by athanassoula ( 1992 ) that the dust lane curvature anticorrelates with the bar strength .",
    "strong bars thus host straight dust lanes , while weaker bars can host more curved dust lanes .",
    "we do find that the anticorrelation has a large spread , but from a set of 238 numerical simulations of barred galaxies we show that this spread can be greatly reduced by using an appropriate linear combination of bar parameters ( @xmath0 and the axis ratio @xmath2 ) .",

    "<S> we test the theoretical prediction that the straightest dust lanes in bars are found in strongly barred galaxies , or more specifically , that the degree of curvature of the dust lanes is inversely proportional to the strength of the bar . </S>",
    "<S> the test used archival images of barred galaxies for which a reliable non - axisymmetric torque parameter ( @xmath0 ) and the radius at which @xmath0 has been measured ( @xmath1 ) have been published in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm the theoretical prediction but show a large spread that can not be accounted for by measurement errors . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate 238 galaxies with different bar and bulge parameters in order to investigate the origin of the spread in the dust lane curvature versus @xmath0 relation . from these simulations , we conclude that the spread is greatly reduced when describing the bar strength as a linear combination of the bar parameters @xmath0 and the quotient of the major and minor axis of the bar , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the dust lane curvature is predominantly determined by the parameters of the bar . </S>"
