    "this approximation , however , fails to account for multielectron and multichannel effects @xcite in high - field phenomena .",

    "the td - cis method has an advantage to give a clear one - electron picture for multichannel ionizations .",

    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite , though attractive for its low computational cost , delivers only the electron density , not the wavefunction , rendering the definition of observables difficult .",

    "we have developed a new _ ab initio _ time - dependent many - electron method called td - casscf .",
    "it applies the concept of casscf , which has been developed for the electronic structure calculation in quantum chemistry , to the multielectron dynamics in intense laser fields , introducing frozen - core , dynamical - core , and active orbital subspaces .",
    "the classification into the subspaces can be done flexibly conforming to simulated physical situations and desired accuracy , and both tdhf and mctdhf methods are included as special cases .",
    "this feature enables compact yet accurate representation of ionization dynamics in many - electron systems , and bridge the huge gap between tdhf and mctdhf methods .",
    "we have applied the td - casscf method to the ionization dynamics of 1d - lih and 1d-(lih)@xmath209 , to assess its capability to describe multichannel and multielectron ionization .",
    "it has been confirmed that the present method closely reproduces rigorous mctdhf results if the active orbital space is properly chosen to include appreciably ionizing electrons .",
    "we have also confirmed that the td - casscf provides substantial computational cost reduction in the ci - length dependent procedures , which scale by far the steepest with the system size in the mctdhf method .",
    "therefore , the td - casscf method is most advantageous for problems in which only a few weakly - bound electrons out of a large number of total electrons ionize .    while it is sometimes stated that the mctdhf method is a time - dependent version of the casscf method @xcite , this statement is even more suitable for the td - casscf method introduced in the present study .",
    "with reduced computational cost , the td - casscf method with a properly chosen active space preserves most of the theoretically important properties of the mctdhf : ( i ) flexibility to account for the strong - correlation involved in the ionization dynamics , ( ii ) size - extensivity , essential for a balanced description of different electronic configurations , ( iii ) gauge - invariance by virtue of the time - dependent variational optimization of orbitals , and ( iv ) invariance against orbital transformation within an orbital subspace , allowing e.g. , the natural orbital analyses of the time - dependent wavefunction @xcite .    it should be noted that the computational cost of the td - casscf method still scales factorially with the number of active ( not total ) electrons , thus its applications are limited to , say , 16 half - filled active orbitals in view of the present state of the art in quantum chemistry .",
    "an example requiring such a large active space is the ionization from densely lying multiple valence orbitals in weakly - interacting molecular clusters .",
    "to approach to such a problem , more restricted ( instead of complete ) constructions of the active space will be necessary .",
    "moreover , a breakthrough is needed to represent one - particle wavefunctions in the general molecular potential without particular symmetries . in spite of these challenges",
    ", we foresee that the td - casscf method will find fruitful applications in multielectron dynamics of , e.g. , rare gas atoms heavier than helium , or molecules composed of atoms in the first few rows of the periodic table , exposed to visible - to - mid - infrared high - intensity pulses , which are inaccessible with the all - electron - active mctdhf method .",
