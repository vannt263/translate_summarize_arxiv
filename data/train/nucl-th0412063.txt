    "high precision nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials such as av18  @xcite , cdbonn  @xcite , nijm i , ii and 93  @xcite describe the nn data set up to about 350 mev very well . when these forces are used to predict binding energies of three - nucleon ( 3n ) systems they underestimate the experimental bindings of @xmath4 and @xmath5 by about 0.5 - 1 mev  @xcite .",
    "this missing binding energy can be cured by introducing a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) into the nuclear hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the study of elastic nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) scattering and nucleon induced deuteron breakup revealed a number of cases where the nonrelativistic description based on pairwise forces only is insufficient to explain the data .",
    "generally , the studied discrepancies between a theory based on nn potentials only and experiment become larger with increasing energy of the 3n system .",
    "adding now a 3nf to the pairwise interactions leads in some cases to a better description of the data .",
    "the elastic nd angular distribution in the region of its minimum and at backward angles is the best studied example  @xcite . the clear discrepancy in this angular regions at energies below @xmath6  mev nucleon lab energy between a theory based on nn potentials only and the cross section data can be removed by adding modern 3nfs to the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "such a 3nf must be adjusted with each nn potential separately to the experimental binding of @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite . at",
    "energies higher than @xmath7  mev current 3nfs only partially improve the description of cross section data and the remaining discrepancies , which increase with energy , indicate the possibility of relativistic effects .",
    "the need for a relativistic description of 3n scattering was also raised when precise measurements of the total cross section for neutron - deuteron ( nd ) scattering  @xcite were analyzed within the framework of nonrelativistic faddeev calculations  @xcite .",
    "nn forces alone were insufficient to describe the data above @xmath7  mev .",
    "the effects due to relativistic kinematics considered in ref .",
    "@xcite were comparable at higher energies to the effects due to 3nfs .",
    "these indications show the importance of a study taking relativistic effects in the 3n continuum into account .",
    "the estimation of relativistic effects on the binding energy of three nucleons has been the focus of a lot of work .",
    "basically two different aproaches have been followed : one is a manifestly covariant scheme linked to a field theoretical approach  @xcite , the other one is based on relativistic quantum mechanics formulated on spacelike hypersurfaces in minkowski space  @xcite . within the second scheme the relativistic hamiltonian for on the mass shell particles consists of relativistic kinetic energies and two- and many - body interactions including their boost corrections , which are dictated by the poincar algebra  @xcite .",
    "the applications of these two types of approaches to the 3n bound state have led to contradictory results . in the approach based on field theory ,",
    "relativistic effects increase the triton binding energy , while in the approach based on relativistic hamiltonians they decrease the triton binding energy .",
    "this requires further insights which is beyond the scope of this paper .    due to the increased complexity of 3n scattering calculations as compared to the bound state problem no results for the 3n continuum including relativity are available . in order to extend the hamiltonian scheme in equal time formulation to 3n scattering one",
    "needs as a starting point the lorentz boosted nn potential which generates the nn t matrix in a moving frame via a standard lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "such potentials have been worked out and applied to a 3n bound state in  @xcite . the results obtained supported the relativistic effects found before in a relativistic quantum mechanics approach  @xcite . the starting point for a nn potential in an arbitrary moving frame is the interaction in the two - nucleon c.m .",
    "system , which enters a relativistic nn schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "it differs from the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation just by the relativistic form for the kinetic energy .",
    "the current realistic nn potentials are defined and fitted in the context of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation . up to now",
    "nn potentials refitted with the same accuracy in the framework of the relativistic nn schrdinger equation do not exist . in  @xcite such refitting was omitted and an analytical scale transformation of momenta which relates nn potentials in the nonrelativistic and relativistic schrdinger equations in such a way , that exactly the same nn phase shifts are obtained by both equations , was employed  @xcite .    though this transformation is not a substitute for a nn potential with proper relativistic features it can serve as a first step to illustrate the effects of lorentz boosts on nn potentials .",
    "such an approach was applied in  @xcite and we also will follow it in the present study to get the first estimation of relativistic effects in the 3n continuum . in this first study we would like to find out what are the changes of elastic nd scattering observables when the nonrelativistic form of the kinetic energy is replaced by the relativistic one and a proper treatment of boost effects and effects due to wigner rotations of spin states is performed .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we lay out the relativistic features underlying our treatment for a relativized faddeev equation in the 3n continuum .",
    "this incorporates the definition of the boosted two - body force , the various two - and three - body states in general frames , the wigner rotations and the singularity structure of the relativistic free 3n propagator .",
    "our manner to treat the 3n faddeev equation is guided by the lines presented in  @xcite for the nonrelativistic case . in sec .",
    "iii we focus on the relativistic nn potential and discuss the quality of different approximations for the boosted potential . as a consequence , in this first study",
    "we restrict ourselves to the leading order relativistic term in the expansion of the boosted potential . in sec .",
    "iv we apply our formulation based on a relativistic nn interaction which is exactly on - shell equivalent to the nonrelativistic av18 potential and solve the relativized 3n faddeev equation with different approximations for the boost .",
    "we show and discuss results for elastic nd scattering .",
    "v contains a summary and outlook .",
    "the nucleon - deuteron scattering with neutron and protons interacting through a nn potential @xmath8 alone is described in terms of a breakup operator t satisfying the faddeev - type integral equation  @xcite    @xmath9    the two - nucleon ( 2n ) t - matrix t results from the interaction @xmath8 through the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the permutation operator @xmath10 is given in terms of the transposition @xmath11 which interchanges nucleons i and j. the incoming state @xmath12 describes the free nucleon - deuteron motion with relative momentum @xmath13 and the deuteron wave function @xmath14 . finally @xmath15 is the free 3n propagator . the physical picture underlying eq.([eq1a ] )",
    "is revealed after iteration which leads to a multiple scattering series for t.    the elastic nd scattering transition operator u is given in terms of t by  @xcite @xmath16    this is our standard nonrelativistic formulation , which is equivalent to the nonrelativistic 3n schrdinger equation plus boundary conditions .",
    "the formal structure of these equations in the relativistic case remains the same but the ingredients change . as explained in  @xcite the relativistic 3n hamiltonian",
    "has the same form as the nonrelativistic one , only the momentum dependence of the kinetic energy changes and the relation of the pair interactions to the ones in their corresponding c.m .",
    "frames changes , too .",
    "consequently all the formal steps leading to eqs.([eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq1c ] ) remain the same .    the relativistic kinetic energy of three equal mass nucleons in their c.m",
    ". system can conveniently be presented by introducing the free two - body mass operator .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the momenta in one of the two - body subsystems , then @xmath19 is the momentum dependent 2n mass operator and the 3n kinetic energy can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the momentum of the third particle and @xmath22 the total momentum of the chosen two - body subsystem ( m is the nucleon mass ) .",
    "any two - body subsystem can be chosen .",
    "as introduced in  @xcite the pair forces in the relativistic 3n hamiltonian living in moving frames are chosen as @xmath23 where @xmath24 for @xmath25 reduces to the potential @xmath26 defined in the 2n c.m .",
    "note that also in that system the relativistic kinetic energy of the two nucleons has to be chosen , which together with @xmath26 defines the interacting two - nucleon mass operator occuring in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "let us now firstly regard the 2n subsystem .",
    "the standard nonrelativistic 2n lippmann schwinger equation turns now into a relativistic one , which in a general frame reads @xmath27    we refer to @xmath28 as the boosted 2n t - matrix like we talk of the boosted 2n potential in eq.([eq1 ] ) .    using ( [ eq1 ] ) the relativistic 2n schrdinger equation for the deuteron in a moving frame can be cast into the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy of the deuteron in motion and @xmath31 its rest mass .",
    "this equation is a good check for the correct numerical implementation of the boosted potential @xmath32 as will be used below .    the new relativistic ingredients in eqs.([eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq1c ] )",
    "will therefore be the boosted t - operator and the relativistic 3n propagator @xmath33 where @xmath34 is given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and @xmath35 is the total 3n c.m . energy expressed in terms of the initial neutron momentum @xmath13 relative to the deuteron @xmath36    currently eq.([eq1a ] ) in its nonrelativistic form is numerically solved for any nn interaction using a momentum space partial wave decomposition .",
    "details are presented in ref .",
    "this turns eq.([eq1a ] ) into a coupled set of two- dimensional integral equations .",
    "as we show now , in the relativistic case we can keep the same formal structure , though the kinematics and the momentum representation of the permutation operator p is more complex and boosted t - operators as well as wigner rotations will appear .    in the nonrelativistic case the partial wave projected momentum space basis is @xmath37 where p and q are the magnitudes of standard jacobi momenta ( see @xcite ) and @xmath38 two - body quantum numbers with obvious meaning , @xmath39 refer to the third nucleon ( described by the momentum q ) , @xmath40 is the total 3n angular momentum and the rest are isospin quantum numbers .",
    "this is now to be generalized to the relativistic case .",
    "we regard firstly the two - nucleon system and replace the nonrelativistic relative two - nucleon momentum @xmath41 by @xmath17 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related to general momenta of two nucleons , say @xmath42 and @xmath43 , by a lorentz boost : @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is a relativistic generalization of the nonrelativistic relative momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the individual momentum state with momentum @xmath48 for an on - the - mass - shell particle with mass @xmath49 is defined in terms of the state in the rest frame as  @xcite @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the unitary operator related to the special ( along @xmath17 ) boost matrix @xmath52 , @xmath53 the spin magnetic quantum number and @xmath54 with @xmath55 . note that by definition @xmath53 does not change .",
    "the @xmath56 matrix @xmath52 is given in the appendix .    a following unitary operation related to the general boost",
    "@xmath57 leads to the well known wigner rotation  @xcite : @xmath58    the argument in the second unitary operator is a rotation matrix @xmath59 and often denoted as wigner rotation .",
    "further the on shell momenta @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related by @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 being a rotation yields @xmath64 and using ( [ eqn3 ] ) again to @xmath65 here @xmath66 are the standard su(2 ) wigner d - matrices  @xcite and their arguments euler angles which are related to @xmath67 as shown below .",
    "now we apply a general boost to the noninteracting two nucleon state @xmath68    in the notation to the left we changed from the two individual momenta to the relative momentum @xmath17 and the total two - nucleon momentum zero .",
    "since the two nucleons are noninteracting @xmath69 acting on a two - body system is a tensor product @xmath70 acting on the two spaces of nucleons 2 and 3 .",
    "we choose @xmath57 as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "that boost matrix @xmath71 maps @xmath17 into @xmath42 and @xmath18 into @xmath43 .",
    "we obtain @xmath73 of course @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by the inverse relation to ( 10 ) and the related expression for @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand the noninteracting two - nucleon system with total momentum zero can be considered as one object with a mass @xmath74 and therefore according to the general relation ( [ eqn3 ] ) one obtains @xmath75 and we end up with @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the jacobian for the lorentz transformation from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "this relation generalizes the one used in @xcite and @xcite from the spinless case to the one with spin . in the nonrelativistic case",
    "the d - matrices reduce to kronecker symbols and the jacobian is one . thus @xmath80 equals directly @xmath81 , where @xmath48 equals the nonrelativistic relative momentum .",
    "the next step is the transition to partial waves .",
    "firstly one defines the two - body orbital angular momentum states @xmath82    then we couple with the total spin @xmath83 in the two - nucleon c.m .",
    "system to the total angular momentum @xmath84 and its magnetic quantum number @xmath53 : @xmath85    the special boost @xmath71 leads then to @xmath86 and applied individually leads finally to @xmath87 this is the connection of the partial wave projected two - nucleon state with internal momentum k and total momentum @xmath88 to arbitrary individual momentum and spin states .",
    "another requisite is the determination of the euler angles ( @xmath89 ) in the spin 1/2 d - matrices .",
    "according to ( 13 ) the two @xmath90 matrices @xmath91 representing rotations have the structure @xmath92 where m is the unitary @xmath93 matrix for the wigner rotation .",
    "it has generally the form  @xcite @xmath94 this determines the 3 euler angles .",
    "the matrix @xmath95 related to the first equation in ( [ eqm1 ] ) is given in the appendix .",
    "it remains to add the third free particle whose momentum @xmath96 together with the total two - nucleon momentum @xmath97 adds up to zero in the 3n c.m . system .",
    "sticking to our standard nonrelativistic notation we denote the orbital angular momentum of that third particle by @xmath98 and couple it with its spin to its total angular momentum @xmath99 .",
    "then the 3n partial wave state is @xmath100 in that expression @xmath42 and @xmath43 are functions of @xmath17 and @xmath101 .    for the evaluation of the partial wave representation of the permutation operator p",
    "we need the projection of that state @xmath102 onto @xmath103 .",
    "doing that one encounters ( @xmath104 ) @xmath105 this is verified for instance by integrating both sides over @xmath106 and @xmath107 and by converting the integral on the right hand side to an integral over @xmath108 and @xmath88 . thus using ( 28 )",
    "one obtains @xmath109    this is the basic expression needed for the evaluation of the partial wave representation of the permutation operator p. equipped with that , projecting eq.(1 ) onto the basis states ( 28 ) one encounters like in the nonrelativistic notation  @xcite @xmath110 this is evaluated by inserting the complete basis of states @xmath111 and using ( 30 ) .",
    "the result is worked out in the appendix .",
    "it can be expressed in a form which resembles closely the one appearing in the nonrelativistic regime  @xcite @xmath112 where all ingredients are given in the appendix .",
    "it remains to regard the free propagator adjacent to the permutation operator p in eq.([eq1a ] ) .",
    "since only momenta are involved in the propagator the convenient formal steps outlaid in  @xcite can be shown in a momentum vector notation thereby simplifying the notation .",
    "let @xmath113 denote the 3n state expressed in vector momenta analogous to ( 20 ) and neglecting spin and isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "the index 1 indicates as above that the 2n subsystem ( 23 ) has been chosen which is described by the internal momentum @xmath17 .",
    "similarily an index 2 indicates the choice of the ( 31 ) subsystem .",
    "then one obtains @xmath114    we recognize that the free propagator depends on @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 like in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "after partial wave decomposition there arises an integration over the interval @xmath118 $ ] for @xmath119 .",
    "this leads to the well known logarithmic singularities , which have been well studied for the nonrelativistic free propagator . that nonrelativistic propagator results simply by expanding the square roots in eq .",
    "( [ eqm8 ] ) and keeping the leading terms . like in the nonrelativistic case it is now convenient to put the free propagator into the form @xmath120 .",
    "a simple algebra leads in obvious notation to @xmath121 with @xmath122    altogether we end up with the infinite system of coupled integral equations analogous to the one in the nonrelativistic case  @xcite : @xmath123    the geometrical coefficients @xmath124 , the coefficients @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and the momenta @xmath127 and @xmath128 stem from the matrix element @xmath129 of the permutation operator ( eqs.([eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq21a ] )  ) . the quantum numbers in the set @xmath130 differ from those in @xmath131 only in the orbital angular momentum @xmath132 of the pair .    as mentioned earlier the main problem of treating eq.([eq1f ] ) is caused by the singularities of the free propagator @xmath15 which occur in the region of q and q values for which @xmath133 .",
    "in addition at @xmath134 there is the singularity of the 2n t - matrix which occurs in the @xmath135 partial wave state , where the deuteron bound state exists .",
    "the method to treat this singularity is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "it amounts to separate all channels @xmath131 which are `` deuteron''-like ( angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath136 or @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) from the others . in the `` deuteron''-like channels one separates the bound state pole and treats it by subtraction  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the treatment of the @xmath15 singularities follows the nonrelativistic case as described in detail in ref .",
    "the only difference is that the relativistic boundaries of the q , q-values at which @xmath140 differ from the nonrelativistic boundaries .",
    "equation ( [ eq1f ] ) is solved by generating its neumann series , which is then summed up by the pad method .",
    "due to short - range nature of the nn force it can be considered negligible beyond a certain value @xmath141 of the total angular momentum in the two nucleon subsystem . generally with increasing energy @xmath141 will also increase .",
    "for @xmath142 we put the t - matrix to be zero , which yields a finite number of coupled channels for each total angular momentum j and total parity @xmath143 of the 3n system . to achieve converged results at our energies we used all partial wave states with total angular momenta of the 2n subsystem up to @xmath144 and took into account all total angular momenta of the 3n system up to @xmath145 .",
    "this leads to a system of up to 143 coupled integral equations in two continuous variables for a given @xmath40 and parity .",
    "as dynamical input we used a relativistic interaction @xmath26 , which is defined as partner of the relativistic kinetic energy , generated from the nonrelativistic nn potential av18 according to the analytical prescription of ref .",

    "we numerically solved the 3n faddeev equation for nd scattering including relativistic features at the neutron lab energies @xmath196 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3  mev .",
    "the relativistic features are the relativistic form of the free propagator and the change of the nn potential caused by the boost of the 2n subsystem .",
    "in addition these boosts also induce wigner spin rotations . for the momentum space basis we used the relative momentum of two free nucleons in their c.m .",
    "system together with their total momentum which in the 3n c.m .",
    "system is the negative momentum of the spectator nucleon .",
    "such a choice of momenta is adequate for relativistic kinematics and allows to generalize the nonrelativistic approach used to solve the nonrelativistic 3n faddeev equation to the relativistic case in a more or less straightforward manner .",
    "that relative momentum in the two - nucleon subsystem is a generalisation of the standard nonrelativistic jacobi momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the inclusion of the nucleon spins leads automatically to wigner spin rotations in the context of boosting the 2n c.m .",
    "subsystems . the momentum partial wave basis , a generalisation of the nonrelativistic one , is , however , now more complex . as dynamical input we took the nonrelativistic nn potential av18 and",
    "generated in the 2n c.m .",
    "system an exactly on - shell equivalent relativistic interaction @xmath26 using an analytical scale transformation of momenta .",
    "we checked that in our energy range the boost effects for this potential could be sufficiently well incorporated by restricting the exact expression to the leading order terms in a @xmath153 and @xmath154 expansion .",
    "we found that in the studied energy range the effects of wigner spin rotations are practically negligible for the cross section and analyzing powers .",
    "relativistic effects for the cross section appear at higher energies and they are restricted only to the very backward angles where relativity increases the nonrelativistic cross section . at other angles the effects are small . in spite of the fact that the relativistic phase - space factor increases with energy faster than the nonrelativistic one , the relativistic nuclear matrix element outweighs this increase and leads for the cross section in a wide angular range to a relatively small relativistic effect .",
    "also for spin observables ( analyzing powers , spin correlation coefficients and spin transfer coefficients , not shown ) no drastic changes due to relativity have been found .",
    "the comparison of our nonrelativistic theory with existing cross section data exhibits at the higher energies clear discrepancies . according to our presented results effects due to relativity",
    "are significant only in the region of very backward angles where they increase the cross section .",
    "they are relatively small in the region of the cross section minimum around @xmath197 , where the discrepancies between the theory based on pairwise forces only and data are largest . at lower energies ( up to about @xmath198  mev ) this discrepancy can be removed when current three - nucleon forces ( 3nfs ) , mostly of @xmath199-exchange character  @xcite , are included in the nuclear hamiltonian . at the higher energies , however , a significant part of the discrepancy remains and increases further with increasing energy .",
    "this indicates that additional 3n forces should be added to the @xmath200-exchange type forces .",
    "natural candidates in the traditional meson - exchange picture are exchanges like @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "this has to be expected since in @xmath203pt @xcite in the order in which nonvanishing 3nf s appear the first time there are three topologies of forces , the @xmath199-exchange , a one - pion exchange between one nucleon and a two - nucleon contact interaction and a pure 3n contact interaction .",
    "they are of the same order and have to be kept together .",
    "therefore it appears very worthwhile to persue a strategy adding in the traditional meson exchange picture further 3n forces .",
    "our results here showing that relativistic effects based on relativistic kinematics and boost effects of the nn force are small support the usefulness of high energy elastic nd scattering to study 3n force properties .",
