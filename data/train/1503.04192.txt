    "deviations from homogeneity are conventionally treated in the framework of peculiar velocities , by which the mean redshift , @xmath0 , and luminosity distance , @xmath1 , of a galaxy cluster are converted to a peculiar velocity at small redshifts according to v = cz - r[vpec ] where @xmath2 is the speed of light and @xmath3 is the hubble constant .    while large galaxy surveys reveal that statistical homogeneity emerges on scales @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 @xcite as determined by the two  point galaxy correlation function , in the standard peculiar velocities framework relatively large bulk flows are seen on scales larger than this relative to our own location .",
    "the amplitude of such flows , and their consistency with the standard lambda cold dark matter ( ) cosmology , are a matter of ongoing debate @xcite . while it may be possible to achieve convergence of such bulk flows to the cmb frame within current uncertainties based on cosmic variance and @xmath6-body simulations in the  model , given the deep mystery associated with the nature of dark energy , it is important that alternative cosmological models are investigated .",
    "such alternatives @xcite may also demand a treatment of cosmic expansion which includes effects of inhomogeneities that fall outside the peculiar velocity framework , with testable observational consequences @xcite .",
    "the peculiar velocity framework makes a strong geometrical assumption over and above what is demanded by general relativity .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath7 defined by ( [ vpec ] ) only has the physical characteristics of a velocity if one implicitly assumes the spatial geometry _ on all scales _ larger than those of bound systems is exactly described by a homogeneous isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model with a single cosmic scale factor , @xmath8 , whose derivative defines a single global hubble constant , @xmath9 .",
    "deviations from the uniform expansion are then ascribed to lorentz boosts of each galaxy cluster with respect to the spatial hypersurfaces of average homogeneity , at each cluster location .",
    "it is a consequence of general relativity , however , that inhomogeneous matter distributions generally give rise to a differential expansion of space that can not be reduced to a single uniform expansion plus local boosts .",

    "any definition of the expansion rate in such models depends on the spatial scale relative to that of the inhomogeneities .",
    "although one can define scale dependent hubble parameters for specific exact solutions  for example , given the spherical symmetry of the ltb model  the actual cosmic web is sufficiently complex that in reality one must deal with spatial or null cone averages in general relativity .    in recent work",
    "@xcite examined the variation of the hubble expansion from a fresh perspective , by generalizing the earlier approaches of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , given that there is a notion of statistical homogeneity on large ( @xmath10 ) scales , then an average expansion law characterized by a single asymptotic hubble constant , @xmath11 , is applicable on such scales .",
    "however , from the first principles of general relativity one should make no geometrical assumptions about cosmic expansion below the statistical homogeneity scale , where cosmic expansion is nonlinear .",
    "one can nonetheless perform radial and angular averages of the distance versus redshift of a large sample of galaxies in spherical shells , and compare the results with the asymptotic hubble constant in order to quantify the nonlinear variation of the hubble expansion .",

    "* on scales @xmath14 the spherically averaged value , @xmath12 , in independent shells is greater than the asymptotic value , @xmath11 . however , the difference is significantly larger in the standard rest frame of the cmb radiation when compared to either the rest frame of the local group ( lg ) of galaxies or the local sheet ( ls ) . in other words ,",
    "the spherically averaged hubble expansion is more uniform in the lg rest frame than in the cmb rest frame , with very strong bayesian evidence , @xmath15 .",
    "the uniformity of expansion in the lg and ls frames is statistically indistinguishable .",
    "* by a variety of angular tests , the residual variation of the spherical ( monopole ) hubble expansion is found to be correlated with structures in the range @xmath16  @xmath17 , which give a hubble expansion dipole with a markedly different character in the cmb and lg frames . *",
    "a skymap of angular variation of the hubble expansion in the lg frame , constructed by gaussian window averaging @xcite , has a very strong dipole .",
    "the angular expansion skymap has a correlation coefficient of @xmath18 with the residual cmb temperature dipole in the lg frame . * on scales @xmath19 the magnitude of the dipole variation in the hubble expansion is less in the lg frame than in the cmb frame .",
    "while the lg frame dipole is statistically consistent with zero in most individual outer shells , by contrast the cmb frame dipole magnitude rises to a residual level .",
    "consequently the large bulk flow reported by @xcite may be partly due to a choice of rest frame .",
    "the first of the results above is consistent with other observations which find that a notion of statistical homogeneity emerges at scales of order @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fact that @xmath20 on the @xmath21 scales on which the hubble expansion is nonlinear agrees well with the observation that the largest typical long sloan great wall @xcite and the @xmath22 long large quasar group @xcite are known , but it is arguable that these are not typical . ] structures in the late epoch universe are voids of diameter @xmath23 @xcite .",

    "this approach makes no assumptions about spatial geometry of the universe on the scales in question , and thus is model independent.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    while the results just discussed may not be surprising to those familiar with the statistics of the cosmic web , the remaining results of @xcite listed above are not at all expected in the conventional approach to peculiar velocities in observational cosmology . in particular , the cosmic rest frame should be the one in which the variation of cosmic expansion is a minimum in some sense .",
    "the results of @xcite show that such a frame of minimum nonlinear hubble expansion variation is not the conventional cmb frame .",
    "one important consequence is that a substantial fraction of the cmb dipole usually attributed to a local boost of the local group at @xmath25 @xcite in the direction @xmath26 would be due to a nonkinematic differential expansion of space .",
    "it has been independently shown that the radio galaxy number count dipole appears to be nonkinematic , at the 99.5% confidence level , using the nrao vla sky survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that a 0.5% anisotropy in the distance ",
    "redshift relation on @xmath21 scales would be required to achieve the observed properties of the cmb dipole .",
    "furthermore , using ray  tracing simulations on an exact szekeres solution of einstein s equations which exhibits differential expansion on such scales , it is found that it is possible to produce a hubble expansion dipole which is very close to that of the sample , while simultaneously generating cmb anisotropies that both account for the residual temperature dipole in the lg frame and are consistent with the amplitude of higher order multipoles @xcite .",
    "this may potentially provide an explanation for the angular scale dependence observed in attempts to measure the boost to the cmb frame using the effects of special relativistic aberration and modulation on the cmb anisotropy spectrum @xcite .",
    "since subtraction of a kinematic dipole is a key step in the map making process , this may also have a direct impact on various large angle anomalies in the cmb anisotropy spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , given that a transformation to the cmb frame is a step that is taken in many observational procedures without question , the possibility that a substantial fraction of the cmb dipole may be nonkinematic could have a large impact in other areas of observational cosmology",
    ".    given the potential importance of such a result , it is important to try to characterize the frame of minimum nonlinear hubble expansion variation in purely observational terms .",
    "@xcite compared the lg and ls frames with that of the cmb , motivated by the starting point that a frame close to the lg frame would be the natural standard of rest according to the `` cosmological equivalence principle '' @xcite which underlies the approach of @xcite to the averaging problem in inhomogeneous cosmology @xcite .",

    "independent fashion whether there is a rest frame in which the nonlinear variation of the hubble expansion is minimized ?",
    "we will consider all scales over which cosmic expansion is nonlinear and transitions to linearity , and the question of how such a transition impacts the characterization of a minimum variation frame .",
    "while our principal results are determined from an analysis of the sample @xcite , we have also considered the recently published _",
    "cosmicflows_-2 ( cf2 ) sample of @xcite .",
    "we find that the issue of the different treatments of malmquist bias in the two datasets at present prevents as detailed analysis as we perform for the sample .",
    "however , our investigation highlights how the implicit assumption of a flrw expansion law below the scale of statistical homogeneity via ( [ vpec ] ) subtly influences the manner in which such biases are treated in practice , and raises concerns about remaining distribution biases in the cf2 distances .",
    "in this paper we will use the methodology of @xcite , who considered both radial and angular averages of the hubble expansion in the sample , adapting techniques that @xcite and @xcite had previously applied to radial and angular averages respectively in the much smaller hubble telescope key project dataset @xcite .",
    "we are primarily interested in the radial spherical averages , as it was by this method that @xcite found the most decisive evidence that the hubble expansion is significantly more uniform in the lg or ls frames , as compared to the standard cmb rest frame .",
    "we begin by repeating the analysis of @xcite , but without assuming that our own standard of rest is known . in particular",
    ", we will make arbitrary local boosts of the central observer , and perform numerical studies on the sample to determine what cosmic rest frame(s ) are singled out by minimizing the variation in the spherically averaged nonlinear hubble expansion",
    ".    an arbitrary boost of the central observer has the effect of transforming the inferred redshift of individual sources we observe from values , @xmath27 , in any one rest frame to new values given by cz_i=cz_i+v_i [ zp]where @xmath28 is the boost magnitude at our origin , and @xmath29 is the angle between each data point and the boost direction .",
    "we stress that in our nonlinear framework the boost velocity @xmath28 of the central observer is a distinct quantity from the peculiar velocities of individual sources , @xmath7 , in the linear peculiar velocities framework ( [ vpec ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we determine the best fit linear hubble law  even in the regime in which the average expansion is nonlinear  by standard linear regression in independent radial shells , minimizing the quantity [ hs_chi ] ^2_s=_i=1^n_s^2 , with respect to @xmath30 , where @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the redshift , distance and distance uncertainty of each object , and @xmath33 is the number of data points in a given shell , @xmath34 .",
    "this method , with distance as a function of redshift , is chosen because all uncertainties in the sample have been included as distance uncertainties .",
    "any corrections that would be required due to noise arising from peculiar motion within galaxy clusters have been accounted for by assigning a distance and uncertainty to the cluster itself rather than individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath27 are taken to be exact , whereas the distance uncertainties are large , approximately 15% for most sample objects .",
    "fortunately , the large number of data points within each shell nonetheless lead to statistically significant results .    the value of the hubble constant in the @xmath34th shell is then determined as [ hsav ] h_s=(_i=1^n_s)(_i=1 ^n_s)^-1 while its weighted average luminosity distance is [ rsav ] |r_s=(_i=1^n_s)(_i=1 ^n_s)^-1 .",
    "the radial averages are computed in two different shell configurations of 11 shells , for luminosity distances with @xmath35 .",

    "the two shell configurations are labelled using unprimed and primed integers respectively , as given in table  1 of @xcite . given less data at large distances ,",
    "the shells @xmath39 and @xmath40 are taken to be wider than the rest so as to include approximately the same number of data points as the inner shells .",
    "they both have an outer cutoff at @xmath41 .",
    "the outermost shell 11 has an outer bound given by the largest distance in the sample , and is the same in both configurations , to provide an anchor for the asymptotic value of the hubble constant , @xmath11 .",

    "the zero point uncertainty arises from the fact that a linear hubble law must necessarily pass through the origin .",
    "however , there is an uncertainty in determining the origin , due to a @xmath42 uncertainty in the heliocentric peculiar velocity of the lg ( and ls ) frames @xcite and a 0.4% uncertainty in the magnitude of the cmb dipole @xcite , which combine to give @xmath43 @xcite . for each shell ,",

    "@xcite propose that the much larger monopole variation of the linear hubble law observed in the cmb frame , as compared to the lg / ls frames , may have a systematic origin .",
    "this arises from the nonlinear dependence of @xmath12 in ( [ hsav ] ) on the individual @xmath49 values , which change when performing a local lorentz boost to a different frame . by calculating the result of an arbitrary boost on the individual @xmath12 values",

    "thus we do not see a clear systematic boost offset between the local group and the frame corresponding to the global minimum @xmath106 , further ruling this out as a potential candidate for the standard of rest we are looking for .",
    "the next step is a global search for the best systematic boost offset from the lg . in order to further understand the angular distribution of @xmath165 values ( [ fb ] ) for boosts from the lg frame , we arbitrarily choose a boost magnitude of @xmath169 and plot @xmath170 with respect to @xmath126 in fig .",
    "[ boost_skymaps](b ) .",

    "our choice of frame x above is based on taking @xmath181 , a condition which may only be approximately matched in reality , given our huge uncertainties in the coefficient @xmath72 .",
    "we again have a degeneracy in the choice of minimum hubble expansion variation frame that satisfies the two conditions @xmath93 and @xmath188 .",
    "the results of this section confirm the finding of  [ chi_min ] that our determination of a suitable cosmic rest frame is limited in the sample by a degeneracy under boosts close to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the consistency between the methods of this section and  [ chi_min ] may be less significant , as they are not completely independent . in the lg frame",
    "the primary source of the monopole variation is the increased value of @xmath12 in the innermost shells , while the more distant shells closer to the linear regime show closer to asymptotic values . thus boosting to a frame with a reduced @xmath12 in the innermost shells",
    "will give the most significant improvement to @xmath106 , relative to which small changes in the more distant shells are negligible .",
    "this is precisely the type of difference we model with a power law of the form ( [ pl ] ) with @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , if our hypothesis concerning ( [ pl ] ) is correct then it is not surprising that we see the consistency in the angular directions that minimize @xmath106 on one hand , and which give values of @xmath62 with @xmath94 on the other .",

    "if we are to define a new cosmic standard of rest , within which we still observe a residual cmb temperature dipole , then @xcite argue that such a dipole must have a nonkinematic origin .",
    "the correlation of the residual cmb temperature dipole and hubble expansion dipole supports the proposal that structures in the nonlinear regime of expansion are simultaneously responsible for these effects .",

    ", the greater number of data points in the cf2 catalogue may potentially yield statistically more accurate results than the sample .",
    "however , at present this is prevented on account of untreated biases , to which we now turn .",
    "the _ cosmicflows_-2 ( cf2 ) and catalogues deal with malmquist distance biases in different ways .",
    "the results of the last section indicate that the treatment of such biases is crucial in establishing the actual nature of the variation of cosmic expansion below the statistical homogeneity scale",
    ". therefore we will perform further analyses to better understand these differences .    since the treatment of malmquist bias is complex",
    ", we will first briefly remind the reader that in its current usage this term refers to at least three distinct biases that affect the average derived distance of a galaxy cluster :    1 .   _",
    "selection bias_this is the simple homogeneous systematic error that results from using objects in a magnitude limited sample @xcite .",
    "if the galaxies in a cluster have a true average flux @xmath220 , since we can only observe the brightest of these , we measure a biased average flux @xmath221 , with the effect of bias increasing with distance .",
    "thus the luminosity distance @xmath222 will be less when using a biased average flux , where @xmath223 is the average luminosity as determined from standard candles calibrated using nearby objects .",
    "_ homogeneous distribution bias_this is a systematic average error for objects around the same derived distance which can be understood in terms of statistical scatter . if we assume a standard gaussian scatter , @xmath224 , in the derived distances about an estimated mean , then",
    " since the radial number density grows as @xmath225  there are more objects with true distances larger than the estimated distance , than smaller .",
    "thus at a given derived distance , more galaxies will have been scattered by the errors down from larger true distances than up from smaller ones @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to giving more statistical weight to more distant values and thus the probability distribution for the true distance is no longer gaussian along the line of sight , centred on the measured distance , instead being skewed towards greater distances .",
    "for the special case of a constant density distribution , for example , one arrives at eddington s formula @xcite [ eddington ] e(_|_)=_+1.382 ^ 2 , where @xmath226 is the standard distance modulus when @xmath1 is given in mpc .",
    "inhomogeneous distribution bias_the inhomogeneous bias is analogous to the homogeneous one in that it involves a systematic error in the statistical scatter of objects due to their distribution in 3dimensional space .",
    "however , in this case it arises as number counts are higher in regions of greater density , resulting in a systematic scatter of measurements out of higher into lower density regions @xcite .",
    "thus the inhomogeneous effect is very sensitive to large variations in large - scale structure along the line of sight .",
    "failure to account for this type of bias can give spurious infall signatures on to high density regions .",
    "this bias is of course far more difficult to account for , requiring accurate density fields for structure along the line of sight for each observation .",
    "the selection and homogeneous distribution biases typically lead to underestimates of distances that increase as the distance grows , so that a plot of @xmath227 versus redshift has a positive slope .",
    "however , the inhomogeneous distribution bias can lead to the opposite effect .",
    "for example , @xcite shows that in applying the tfr method when the spatial density of objects at a given 21 cm line width is constant , then the required malmquist correction is the classical one given by @xcite .",
    "however , when this is not the case it is possible to obtain overestimated distances @xcite .",
    "moreover , regardless of the details of any inhomogeneous matter distribution , one just needs the spherically averaged @xmath228 to decrease sufficiently quickly for the direction of scatter in the standard homogeneous distribution bias to be reversed , giving overestimated distances .",
    "some biases can be dealt with in the data reduction .",
    "in particular , by applying the inverse tfr method rather than the direct method one can in principle effectively eliminate the selection bias @xcite , leaving only a considerably smaller bias @xcite .    in the cf2 catalogue @xcite use an inverse tfr procedure to reduce the selection bias only , stating that only a small subsequent correction for residual bias is required . in particular , they `` make no adjustments for the distribution malmquist effects '' in their reported cf2 distances @xcite .",
    "their calibration carried out for this relation follows the procedures of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    on the other hand , the sfi++ catalogue @xcite which forms the major part of the sample includes corrections to account for all homogeneous and inhomogeneous biases in their data . in their view their own treatment of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous distribution biases",
    "was `` straightforward '' , given access to a reconstruction of the local density field @xcite .",
    "however , they stated that their treatment of the selection bias was _ ad hoc _ because the selection criteria used are designed to mimic the observational properties of the survey as closely as possible , and so are very inhomogeneous .",
    "they therefore provided both the raw and corrected distances , should other researchers adopt alternative methods for dealing with selection bias .",
    "the sample incorporates the sfi++ distances with the malmquist bias corrections of @xcite , whereas cf2 uses a subset of uncorrected sfi++ distances . while we do not have the data to independently repeat any of the bias corrections , we are able to test the consistency of assumptions made by @xcite .",

    "nothing in the malmquist bias correction procedure of @xcite could obviously introduce this signature through a systematic error .",
    "their analysis does not single out the lg , or ls , frame in any way ; indeed all their redshifts are referred to the cmb frame .",
    "furthermore , although the remaining bias means that the cf2 sample is currently unusable from the point of view of determining a frame of minimum spherically averaged hubble expansion variation in the nonlinear regime , we observed in  [ cf2boost ] that the _ difference _ of the cmb and lg frame spherical averages nonetheless still shows the signature of the systematic boost offset in the cf2 data .",
    "since the boost offset is detectable in the independently reduced cf2 data , it can not be an artefact of the malmquist bias treatment of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the departure of the nonlinear expansion from the boost power law ( [ pl ] ) that is seen when comparing figs .",
    "[ hdiff2 ] and [ hdiff_cf2_gal ] is precisely what is to be expected if there are additional unaccounted uncertainties in individual cf2 distances as compared to the sfi++ ones : the distance range of structures associated with the nonlinear expansion is broadened .    if fig .",
    "[ compare_vmod ] was based on accurate distances , it would imply that the hubble expansion in all frames of reference is far less uniform than might reasonably be expected in any viable cosmological model ; in particular , there is a monopole or `` hubble bubble '' variation of order 1520% in the range @xmath252 in the cf2 sample , as compared to 45% in the sample .",
    "the largest `` hubble bubble '' variation that has ever been claimed on such scales using more accurate type ia supernovae distances in the cmb frame is @xmath253% @xcite .",
    "@xcite chose not to correct for the distribution biases , as they wished to separate `` the issues of distance measurements and velocity field inferences '' . indeed , in the peculiar velocities approach the distribution bias may be much less significant .",
    "in new work @xcite use the cf2 catalogue to reconstruct large scale structure by means of the wiener filter and constrained realizations of gaussian fields assuming a wmap constrained  model as a bayesian prior .",
    "they observe that `` the malmquist bias introduces a spurious strong monopole term into the reconstructed velocity field but is expected to hardly affect the bulk velocity which is associated with the dipole of the velocity field '' @xcite .",
    "this would appear to be the counterpart of the large monopole we observe in fig .",
    "[ compare_vmod ] in our analysis .",
    "@xcite corrected for the bias but noted that the bulk velocity analysis is `` virtually unaffected by the malmquist bias '' .    in our case ,",
    "residual bulk flows on scales @xmath254 may be an artefact of using the cmb rest frame as the standard when it does not coincide with the frame of minimum hubble expansion variation .",
    "in particular , @xcite observed that a dipole fit to the hubble expansion gave a dipole magnitude which increased to a residual value in the outer shells as the shell radius was increased in the cmb frame , but not in the lg frame .",
    "thus large scale bulk flows are not our primary interest .",
    "rather , we are interested in detecting the systematic monopole variation ( [ eq1 ] ) . in distinction to the peculiar velocity approach our method by necessity is sensitive to a monopole bias .",
    "in fact , our method of binning in radial shells by distance with an anchoring to @xmath11 , is particularly sensitive to any distribution bias which follows from a number density , @xmath228 , with strong gradients .",
    "the bias effect in fig .",
    "[ compare_vmod ] can be largely reproduced by applying a uniform hubble law to the cf2 redshifts , adding gaussian scatter to create a mock distance catalogue , and then applying our binning strategy ( r.  watkins , private communication ) .",
    "it may be possible to construct the @xmath90 velocity attributed to the lg within the  model , as has recently been claimed by @xcite who used constrained @xmath6-body simulations and nonlinear phase space reconstructions to arrive at a value @xmath255 .",
    "however , this itself does not constitute a proof of the standard kinematic interpretation , but rather a verification within the 20% uncertainty of a computer simulation .",
    "the  model is certainly phenomenologically very successful , and any competing model can only be viable insofar as many of its predictions are close to the standard model , as is the case , for example , in the timescape cosmology @xcite .",
    "what is important in testing the standard model is to seek observations which are not expected in its framework .",
    "although the signature of the systematic monopole boost offset ( [ eq1 ] ) between the cmb and lg frames should be checked in  simulations , it is not an observation that should obviously arise if all cosmological redshifts arise purely from a flrw geometry plus local lorentz boosts at any scale .",
    "properly characterizing and determining a frame of minimum nonlinear hubble expansion variation is therefore a fundamental question open to more precise observational tests in future .    in conclusion , if we make no assumptions about our own standard of rest , but make arbitrary boosts at our location , then analysis of the sample yields a degenerate set of frames for which the variation of the spherically averaged nonlinear hubble expansion is minimized .",
    "this set of candidate cosmic rest frames includes the lg frame but excludes the cmb frame , as was already established with very strong bayesian evidence by @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy in defining the minimum variation frame is associated with a freedom to perform boosts in the plane of the galaxy without changing the statistical significance of the fit , probably due to the lack of constraining data in the zone of avoidance .",
    "the larger cf2 sample may potentially tighten the constraints on the definition of the frame of minimum nonlinear expansion variation .",
    "however , it is first necessary to reduce the data in the manner of @xcite to remove the inhomogeneous distribution bias which appears to be the source of the large discrepancies found in  [ cf2 ] .",
    "the universe is very inhomogeneous below the scale of statistical homogeneity , and ironically it is only once the biases associated with such inhomogeneities are removed that a picture of a remarkably uniform average hubble expansion actually emerges .",
    "a careful treatment of inhomogeneous malmquist bias is therefore key for the future progress of our understanding of the nature of cosmic expansion as the surveys grow ever larger .",
