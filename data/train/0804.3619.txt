    "the schwarzschild spacetime ( alias maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime , alias the kruskal spacetime ) is certainly one of the best studied solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "a rare textbook in relativity does not dwell on that space , which is no surprise taking into account its importance and ( relative ) simplicity .",
    "so , one might think that no mysteries are harboured there any longer , a careful reading of @xcite being able to give the answer to almost any  silly \" question .",
    "this , however , is not quite so .",
    "for a person who has not yet got used to the basic concepts of general relativity ( equivalence of all coordinate systems , the impossibility of attaching a preferred extended reference system to an observer , etc . )",
    "the schwarzschild space is fraught with pitfalls .",
    "such a person encounters various  paradoxes \" and  miracles \" ( exactly as in studying special relativity or quantum mechanics ) and it takes some work to sort them out .",
    "unfortunately , the areal of those paradoxes and miracles is not restricted to student internet forums and popular literature .",
    "they have infiltrated the semi - popular , research , and even pedagogical works .",
    "thus one can find there the assertion that , just before crossing a black hole horizon , an astronaut in a single moment of his proper time will see the whole infinitely long evolution of the external universe @xcite .",
    "he will see how our sun swells becoming a red giant , how the earth skimming over the upper atmosphere of the dying sun evaporates in its glare , and how the sun later transforms into a white dwarf  @xcite .",
    "elsewhere one reads that the astronaut will traverse the horizon at the speed of light @xcite and after crossing the horizon he will see the  central singularity \" @xcite .",
    "the authors of these excerptions are all scholars of authority , so one can only pity a student reading all that .",
    "thus , it seems there is a need for a paper where the most puzzling properties of the schwarzschild space would be illuminated in an as clear ( but rigorous ) manner as possible . in the following sections i treat | hopefully just in that manner | a few most  controversial \" issues , which are :",
    "will an observer falling into the black hole see the entire future of our universe ?",
    "will he cross the horizon at the speed of light ?",
    "will he see the singularity ?",
    "is that singularity ",
    "central \" ?",
    "( the answers to all four questions are negative ) .",
    "the reader is supposed to be familiar with only the basics of semi - riemannian geometry .",
    "units are used in which @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest ( i.  e. , non - rotating and uncharged ) black hole is described , as everybody knows , by the spacetime @xmath1 : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a positive parameter ( called the mass , see below ) and @xmath5 is the function defined ( implicitly ) by the equation @xmath6 the importance of @xmath1 | it is this spacetime that we shall call schwarzschild s | lies , of course , in the fact that it is a spherically symmetric solution to the vacuum einstein equations and , moreover , by birkhoff s theorem it is the only such solution in the class of maximal can not be extended , say , to the region @xmath7 because the scalar @xmath8 diverges at @xmath9 . ]",
    "globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "it is often convenient to choose @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 , which is almost the same ) as a new coordinate . that can not be done in the entire @xmath1 ( as follows , for example , from the fact that @xmath12 ) and we shall restrict ourselves to the region @xmath13 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]a it is shown by dark gray ) .    , @xmath14 of the schwarzschild spacetime .",

    "gray the regions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are shown , which are , respectively , expanding and contracting  universes \" ; ( b ) . the gray region is the causal past of @xmath18 , i.  e. , the union of the causal pasts of all its points.[fig : sch ] this region includes _ all _ events that have ever been observed by @xmath18 .",

    "the region is spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat , and the metric there solves the source - free einstein equations .",
    "so , @xmath24 ( and | again by birkhoff s theorem | only @xmath24 ) describes the universe outside a ball of radius @xmath25 and mass @xmath4 .",
    "( the equation for the @xmath11-coordinate of a radial geodesic parametrized by the proper time @xmath26 is with respect to @xmath11 . ] @xmath27 where the dot stands for the derivative by @xmath26 .",
    "the comparison of this equation with the newtonian one justifies our interpretation of @xmath4 as the mass ) .    the surfaces @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( alias @xmath30 , alias @xmath31 ) bounding @xmath15 are called _",
    "it should be emphasized that the points of horizons have no `` magic '' properties ; each of them has a small neighbourhood with exactly the same ( in a qualitative sense ) properties as a neighbourhood of any other point of any spacetime : the tidal forces here are finite , massive bodies move on timelike curves , the world lines of photons are null geodesics , etc .",
    "now , what is there _ beyond _ the horizon ? one might naively expect that since the horizon is a sphere ( at each moment of time ; we are discussing the section of the spacetime by some simultaneity surface @xmath32 ) , then what it bounds is a ball . or rather a punctured ball , with a singularity at the center .",
    "that would perfectly fit the idea that the schwarzschild solution  describes the field of a point mass ( located at the center , the singular point of the metric ) \" @xcite . the said idea goes back to classics of the pre - kruskal epoch @xcite and is amazingly widespread even today .",
    "it should be stressed therefore that the just drawn picture though not _ wrong _",
    "( @xmath32 can be chosen so as to justify it ) is , nevertheless , grossly misleading .",
    "we shall see , in particular , that the term ",
    "central \" is applicable to schwarzschild s singularity no more than , say , to friedmann s .    to perceive the real geometry of",
    "the region @xmath33 ( shadowed in light gray in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]a ) it is instructive to introduce there the coordinates @xmath34 the metric then takes the form @xmath35",
    "@xmath36    the transformation ( [ sckoordi ] ) is singular at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore it _ can not _ be extended to @xmath17 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are _ different _ coordinates .",
    "unfortunately , this fact is overlooked sometimes , which leads to much confusion and the talk about `` space and time swapping their roles '' inside the black hole .",
    "thus , an observer after crossing the horizon finds himself in a `` universe '' with not quite usual properties .",
    "the `` space '' of that universe ( i.  e. , the surface @xmath32 given in this case by the equation @xmath39 ) is a homogeneous cylinder @xmath40 .",
    "it is spherically symmetric , but not isotropic , the distinguished direction being that along the @xmath41-axis . at the same time , even though the surfaces @xmath42 , @xmath43 are spheres , one should not call the @xmath41-coordinate  radial \" , because the space is invariant w.  r.  t. translations in that direction .",
    "note that the space has _ neither _ a singularity , _ nor _ a centre .    with time",
    "the geometry of @xmath17 changes .",
    "this fact is not surprising  the schwarzschild space as a whole is _",
    "non - static _ , even though it has a static [ as is seen from ( [ eq : ussch ] ) ] region @xmath44 that act on @xmath15 _ can _ be extended to the isometries @xmath45 @xmath46 , @xmath47 acting on the entire @xmath1 , but in @xmath48 the orbits of the group @xmath49 are spacelike . ]",
    "the radius of the cylinders @xmath32 falls and it is its vanishing at @xmath50 that is referred to as the schwarzschild singularity ; the other one is , of course , in the past . ] .",
    "evidently , for any observer in @xmath17 the singularity is _ in the future _ and , in particular , _ nobody _ ( on whichever side of the horizon ) can ever observe it .",
    "the surfaces of simultaneity could be chosen differently , of course .",
    "for example , they could be defined by the equation @xmath51 instead of @xmath42 . in such a case",
    "@xmath1 would appear as an evolving wormhole @xcite .",
    "the throat of the wormhole lies in @xmath52 and connects two asymptotically flat isometric  universes \"  ours and @xmath53 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sch ] , the two universes are causally disconnected , but a traveller from one of them is allowed to see some events in the other ( though not before traversing the horizon ) .    often it is @xmath15 that is called schwarzschild s space and @xmath54 , @xmath11  schwarzschild s coordinates , while @xmath1 and @xmath55 are called kruskal ",
    "szekeres. the coordinates @xmath55 cover the entire manifold . and , in studying the _ radial _ motion , when only the sections @xmath56 , @xmath14 matter , their additional advantage is that the metric of those sections takes the form @xmath57 which simplifies significantly the analysis of their causal structure .",
    "a curve in the @xmath58-plane is causal ( i.  e. , can be the world line of a particle ) if and only if in all its points the angle between its tangent and the vertical ( i.  e. , the line @xmath59 ) is @xmath60 .",
    "thus the set of all points from which signals can come to a point @xmath61 | this set is called the _ causal past _ of @xmath61 | is the down - directed angle with the vertex in @xmath61 and the sides parallel to the @xmath62- and @xmath63-axes . and the _ causal future _ of @xmath61 , i.  e. , the set of all points at which @xmath61 can be seen , is the angle vertical to that .",
    "we shall consider only the @xmath58-plane taking into account that the non - radial motion complicates the analysis without adding anything qualitatively new .",
    "so , by a  signal \" or  motion \" , etc .",
    ", from now on we understand a  radially propagating signal \" or  radial motion \" , etc .      to analyze the fall into the black hole let us consider two observers separating into a point @xmath64 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]b .",
    "one of them , let us label him @xmath65 , after the parting moves with constant @xmath11 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "such observers | we shall call them schwarzschild    not depend on time",
    ". it would be quite untrue , however , to regard schwarzschild observers as `` immobile '' or , at least , inertial .",
    "their world lines are _ not _ geodesics ; so the observers experience an acceleration @xmath68 , the fact well known ( empirically ) to the reader as all of us are , to high accuracy , schwarzschild observers with @xmath69 in the metric with @xmath70 and each of us moves | in the instantaneously comoving system | with the acceleration @xmath71m / s@xmath72 .",
    "the second observer , @xmath73 , falls freely , i.  e. , his world line is a radial geodesic @xmath74 with @xmath75 . the most important fact about @xmath73",
    "is that at some moment @xmath76 of its proper time it _ unavoidably _ meets the horizon .    as follows from ( [ eq : radg ] ) the function @xmath77 is convex . at the same time",
    "@xmath78 hence , there _ is _",
    "@xmath79 such that @xmath80 .",
    "so , we only have to prove that @xmath26 takes _ all _ values in @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "in other words , the observer @xmath18 _ must _ reach the horizon , if he lives long enough , and our task is to prove that he does not cease to exist before his clock shows @xmath82 .",
    "note that this follows neither from ( [ eq : radg ] ) , nor from any general considerations : one could imagine , for example , that @xmath18 approaches the horizon like @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]a and leaves @xmath15 as @xmath84 $ ] . to exclude such a possibility notice that as long as @xmath85 stays in @xmath15 the coordinate @xmath63 on it obeys the following assessment @xmath86 where the first equality is the @xmath63-component of the geodesic equation and the second follows from the simple chain @xmath87 in which we have made use of ( [ eq : def r ] ) . both @xmath63 and @xmath88",
    "are positive in @xmath15 , and from ( [ eq : ocen ] ) it follows immediately that @xmath89 where @xmath90 are some constants .",
    "consequently , until @xmath73 leaves @xmath15 , @xmath91 is bounded on any interval",
    ".    once @xmath73 enters @xmath17 it can not cross the horizon back and inevitably terminates at the singularity ( @xmath92 as @xmath93 ) .",
    "note that the same is true for _ any _ causal curve | geodesic or not | just because it has to stay within the right angle with the vertex in its ( arbitrary ) point and the sides parallel to the @xmath62- and @xmath63-axes .",
    "all the abovesaid looks quite elementary .",
    "however , for the reasons discussed in the introduction we should discuss in more detail two aspects of @xmath18 s history .",
    "it is common knowledge that an object _ similar to _ the black hole exists in newtonian physics too .",
    "if a ball has a sufficiently large mass and small radius , the escape velocity @xmath94 may equal the speed of light .",
    "but a body falling on such a ball | with the zero initial speed | from infinity would land just with @xmath94 . perhaps , it is such reasoning that gave rise to a popular belief that a body crosses the horizon at the speed of light .",
    "is it true ?    at first glance | yes . indeed , consider a family of observers @xmath95 : each member @xmath96 meets @xmath18 in the corresponding point | in @xmath97 | and measures @xmath18 s velocity in his , member s , proper reference system . by the proper reference system",
    "we here understand a perfectly local and well - defined entity | an orthonormal tetrad in @xmath97 @xmath98 with the vector @xmath99 tangent to the world line of @xmath96 ( thus , instead of a family of observers we could speak about a tetrad field along @xmath73 ) .",
    "denote now by @xmath100 the 3-velocity of @xmath73 as measured by @xmath96 , i.  e. , found in the basis @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath95 is chosen ( at @xmath102 , of course ) to be the set of schwarzschild observers , then for a radial @xmath73 it can be shown , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 102.7 ) ) , that @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a positive constant which depends on the choice of @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath105 it is this fact that is interpreted sometimes as attainment of the speed of light by a falling body and thereby as self - inconsistency of general relativity , see , e.  g. , @xcite .",
    "the falseness in that interpretation is that @xmath106 is assumed to be continuous in @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , however , the properties of @xmath107 depend heavily on the choice of @xmath95 ( in this sense @xmath108 characterizes @xmath95 rather than @xmath73 ) . and in the case under consideration , when @xmath95 can__not _ _ be complemented in a continuous way by an observer meeting @xmath73 in @xmath109 ( such an observer would have to move with the speed of light ) , the vector @xmath110 has obviously no limit as @xmath111 .",
    "so , @xmath100 could have been continuous in @xmath82 only by a miracle . in other words , ( [ eq : lim ] ) _ does not imply _ @xmath112 .",
    "actually the vector in @xmath109 tangent to @xmath73 is _",
    "timelike_. this has nothing to do with relativity , or even with the metric under discussion , but follows from a fundamental geometric fact : a geodesic timelike in a point ( @xmath64 in this case ) is timelike in _ all _ points .",
    "thus in any orthonormal basis ( i.  e. , in a proper reference system of any observer located in @xmath109 ) @xmath18 crosses the horizon moving slower than light .",
    "another widely met statement is  from the point of view [ or ` in the reference system ' , or ` as measured by the clock ' ] of a remote observer it takes infinite time for a body to reach the horizon \" . in this section",
    "i argue that contrary to the first impression it is _ possible _ to give a meaning to that statement and even in three different ways ( and , indeed , in the literature all three meanings can be met ) .",
    "the statement deserves a detailed analysis , because one of the three interpretations is simply _",
    "wrong_.    the problem , in essence , is that an observer s clock measures the observer s _ proper _ time @xmath26 , i.  e. , for an observer with the world line @xmath113 it measures the quantity @xmath114 ( the dot here is a derivative with respect to @xmath115 ) and no reasonable way is seen to make the clock measure a time interval between events lying _ off _ @xmath65 ( in our case those are the events @xmath64 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "normally this causes no problems , because we can pick _ any _ coordinate system and measure the time by using it . in doing",
    "so we need not bother to interpret the thus defined time as  true \" , or  measured by the clock of this or that observer \" .",
    "hence , the first way to interpret the above - mentioned statement is to reformulate it :  it takes infinite schwarzschild time for a body to reach the horizon \" , or , more strictly ( since the schwarzschild coordinates do not cover @xmath109 ) :  between @xmath64 and @xmath109 there are events on @xmath18 with arbitrarily large @xmath54 \" .",
    "the latter statement is trivially true , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sch ] .",
    "replacement of the words  in the schwarzschild coordinates \" with  from the point of view of a remote observer \" is quite common .",
    "the point is that light signals sent by a schwarzschild observer at regular intervals @xmath116 of his proper time are received by another schwarzschild observer also at regular intervals is static . ]",
    "@xmath117 ( whatever are the corresponding intervals @xmath118 are @xmath119 of the coordinate time )",
    ". which enables one to  synchronize the clocks \" throughout the entire @xmath120 , i.  e. , to introduce the time coordinate by requiring that @xmath121 ( and that is how the schwarzschild time can , indeed , be defined ) .",
    "the similarity of this procedure to that used for building a reference frame in special relativity ( a purely illusive similarity , of course , since @xmath122 even though the observers are  at rest \" w.  r.  t.  each other ) can mislead one into the idea that the schwarzschild coordinates are  more physical \" than the others and , in particular , an interval of @xmath54 is exactly  the time by the clock of a remote observer \" .",
    "it is this deeply non - relativistic idea that makes | actually simple | properties of @xmath1 look paradoxical .",
    "one such paradox has been already considered , another is considered below , and two more are presented in fig .  [ fig : touch ] .",
    "his distance to the horizon is @xmath123 .",
    "evidently @xmath124 as @xmath125 and hence at some @xmath25 he will be only , say , 10@xmath126 cm far from it . what can prevent the observer from simply stretching a hand and touching the horizon ? [ fig : touch],title=\"fig : \" ] + ( a ) ( b )    the fact by itself that two events are separated by an infinite coordinate interval is vapid : it is true for _ any _ pair of causally related events if the time coordinate is chosen appropriately .",
    "a more meaningful  since geometric  statement can be made if we turn from a relation between two events ( @xmath109 and @xmath64 ) to a relation between an event and an observer ( @xmath109 and @xmath127 , respectively ) , or two observers ( @xmath127 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "indeed , notice that the _ whole _",
    "@xmath65 lies in the causal future of the _ segment _ of @xmath18 bounded by @xmath64 and @xmath109 .",
    "physically this means that all his | infinite | life @xmath65 will be able to receive signals sent by his falling comrade _ before _",
    "the latter reached the horizon . @xmath65",
    "may interpret this fact in two ways depending on which spacelike surfaces he chooses as the surfaces of simultaneity ( recall that in general relativity there is _ no _ preferred choice ) :    1 .   if the surfaces are more or less horizontal in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch ] ( for instance , events are regarded simultaneous if they have the same value of @xmath128 ) , then @xmath65 will find nothing unusual in receiving the messages from @xmath18 .",
    "exactly as we speak of the light of a distant star coming to us for years after the star died , @xmath65 could say that due to a huge | and growing | delay he keeps receiving signals from @xmath18 centuries after the latter _ actually _ traversed the horizon .",
    "one can choose , however , the simultaneity surfaces to be more and more tilted ( cf .  the surfaces @xmath129 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]a ) .",
    "this | rather exotic | choice would mean that @xmath65 considers the information received with every signal as more and more fresh . and he would be quite consistent claiming that the fall is infinitely long .",
    "there is , however , another | opposite , in a sense | approach to what should be called infinitely long by a remote observer s clock .",
    "imagine a point @xmath61 which contains the _ entire _",
    "@xmath127 in its causal past .",
    "an observer @xmath130 , if his world line passes through @xmath61 , would see the entire ( infinite ) history of @xmath127 : he will see @xmath127 aging , his sun swelling and reddening , its protons decaying , etc . in his turn , @xmath127 would be able at any moment to send a message to @xmath130 ( though maybe not to receive a response ) .",
    "all in all it would be quite legitimate to say that @xmath130 reaches @xmath61 in infinite time by @xmath65 s clock .    in this",
    "just formulated sense the statement that @xmath18 s falling time is infinite is _ wrong_. indeed , as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]b , @xmath127 | like any other schwarzschild observer | leaves the causal past of @xmath109 and of the entire @xmath18 , too .",
    "so , the falling observer will _ not _ see the entire future of the universe .",
    "moreover , he will see nothing _",
    "at all _ beyond the shadowed region in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch]b .",
    "in particular , the last event in @xmath65 s life observed by @xmath18 before the latter submerges into @xmath15 , is @xmath131 .    in reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes under their event horizons ( which are quite similar to schwarzschild s )",
    "there is another remarkable surface  the cauchy horizon . and",
    "that horizon _ does _ have the property in discussion : an astronaut falling into the black hole reaches the cauchy horizon in a finite proper time and crosses it in a point @xmath61 that contains in its causal past the whole  external universe \" .",
