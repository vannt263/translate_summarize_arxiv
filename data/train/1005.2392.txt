    "in astrophysical applications inertial waves that can exist in rotating bodies may be excited by several different physical mechanisms , most notably through tidal perturbation by a companion ( eg .",
    "papaloizou & pringle 1981 , hereafter pp ) or in the case of compact objects through secular instability arising through gravitational wave losses ( eg .",
    "chandrasekhar 1970 , friedman & schutz 1978 , andersson 1998 , friedman @xmath0 morsink 1998 ) .",
    "they also can play a role in other physical systems .",
    "for example , they can also be excited by several mechanisms in the earth s fluid core with possible detection being announced ( aldridge @xmath0 lumb 1987 ) .    for rotating planets and stars that have a barotropic equation of state",
    "these wave modes are governed by coriolis forces and so have oscillation periods that are comparable to the rotation period .",
    "they are accordingly readily excited by tidal interaction with a perturbing body when the characteristic time associated with the orbit is comparable to the rotation period , which is expected naturally when the rotation period and orbit become tidally coupled .",
    "they may then play an important role in governing the secular orbital evolution of the system .",
    "inertial modes excited in close binary systems in circular orbit were considered by pp and savonije & papaloizou ( 1997 ) .",
    "wu ( 2005)a , b considered the excitation of inertial modes in jupiter as a result of tidal interaction with a satellite and excitation as a result of a parabolic encounter of a planet or star with a central star was studied by papaloizou & ivanov ( 2005 ) , hereafter referred to as pi and ivanov & papaloizou ( 2007 ) , hereafter referred to as ip .",
    "the latter work was applied to the problem of circularisation of extrasolar giant planets starting with high eccentricity . in that work the planet",
    "was assumed coreless .",
    "ogilvie & lin ( 2004 ) and ogilvie ( 2009 ) have considered the case of a cored planet in circular orbit around a central star and found that inertial waves play an important role .",
    "the importance of the role played by inertial waves in the transfer of the rotational energy of a rotating neutron star to gravitational waves via the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability was pointed out by andersson ( 1998 ) .",
    "later studies mainly concentrated on physical mechanisms of dissipation of energy stored in these modes that limit amplitudes of the modes , and , consequently , the strength of the gravitational wave signal . in these studies either numerical methods or simple local estimates of properties of inertial modes were mainly used , see eg . kokkotas ( 2008 ) for a recent review and references .",
    "an analytical treatment of problems related to inertial waves , such as eg . finding normal mode spectra and eigenfunctions , and coupling them to other physical fields , etc .",
    ", is difficult due to a number of principal complicating technical issues .",
    "in particular , the dynamical equations governing the perturbations of a rotating body ( called planet later on ) are , in general , non - separable , for compressible fluids .",
    "when such fluids are considered and rotation is assumed to be small , a low frequency anelastic approximation that filters out the high frequency modes is often used ( see eg .",
    "this simplifies the problem to finding solutions to leading order in the small parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the rotation frequency , @xmath3 is the constant of gravity and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the mass and radius of the planet . in this approximation eigenfrequencies of inertial modes",
    "are proportional to @xmath6 while the form of the spatial distribution of perturbed quantities does not depend on the rotation rate",
    ". however , even when this approximation is adopted , the problem is , in general , non - separable apart from models with a special form of density distribution , see arras et al ( 2003 ) , wu ( 2005)a and below .    additionally , the problem of calculating the inertial mode spectrum and its response to tidal forcing is complicated by the fact that in the inviscid case the spectrum is either everywhere dense or continuous in any frequency interval it spans ( papaloizou & pringle , 1982 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation of , for example , high frequency @xmath7 modes , which are discrete with well separated eigenvalues .",
    "when the anelastic approximation is adopted the singular ill posed nature of the inviscid eigenvalue problem is seen to come from the fact that the governing equation is hyperbolic and the nature of the spectrum is determined by the properties of the characteristics ( eg . wood 1977 ) .",
    "a discrete spectrum is believed to occur when there are no such trajectories that define periodic attractors .",
    "otherwise the inviscid spectrum is continuous .",
    "then , when a small viscosity is introduced the spectrum becomes discrete but normal modes have energy focused onto wave attractors ( see eg .",
    "ogilvie & lin 2004 ) . given these complexities",
    "it is desirable to work with and compare a variety of analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "coreless inviscid rotating planets with an assumed spherical or ellipsoidal shape have a discrete but everywhere dense spectrum that makes difficulties for example with mode identification and application of standard perturbation theory .",
    "however , numerical work indicates that there are well defined global modes that can be identified and followed through a sequence of models ( eg .",
    "lockitch & friedman , 1999 , hereafter lf , and pi ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate the inertial mode spectrum of a uniformly rotating coreless barotropic planet or star and its tidal response by a wkbj approach coupled with first order perturbation theory and compare its eigenvalue predictions with numerical results obtained by a variety of authors and find good agreement apart from some unidentified wkbj modes that are near the limits of the spectrum and for which the perturbation theory appears not to work . for the identified modes we also find remarkably good agreement for the form of the eigenfunctions .",
    "this indicates that they can be represented at low resolution with small scale phenomena being unimportant , meaningful mode identification ( in that the modes can be followed from one model to another ) and at least first order perturbation theory works for these modes .",
    "this is also confirmed in a following paper ( hereafter referred to as pin ) where we investigate the inertial mode spectrum and its tidal response by numerical solution of an initial value problem _ without the anelastic approximation_. we are able to confirm the validity of the anelastic approximation and the applicability of the first order perturbation theory developed here for demonstrating this as well as estimating eigenvalues .",
    "thus a suggestion of goodman & lackner ( 2009 ) that tidal interaction might be seriously overestimated by use of the anelastic approximation is not confirmed .",
    "a wkbj approach to the same problem was also considered by arras et al ( 2003 ) and wu ( 2005)a . however , in this work only terms of leading order in an expansion in inverse powers of a large wkbj parameter @xmath8 ( see the text below for its definition ) were taken into account and treatment of perturbations near the surface and close to the rotational axis were oversimplified . as a consequence , although their results are correct in the formal limit @xmath9 they can not be used to make a correspondence between wkbj modes and those obtained numerically , or an approximate description of modes with a scale that is not very small . in this paper",
    "we treat the problem in a more extended way , considering terms of the next @xmath10 order together with an accurate treatment of perturbations near the surface and close to the rotation axis .",
    "additionally , we consider a frequency correction of the next order , @xmath11 for modes having non - zero azimuthal number , @xmath12 .",
    "we checked results obtained with use of the wkbj formalism against practically all numerical data existing in the literature finding good agreement in practically all cases .",
    "therefore , we can assume that our formalism may be applied to provide an approximate analytic description of inertial modes , including those with large scale variations , where the wkbj approach might be expected to be invalid .",
    "also , different quantities associated with the modes may be described within the framework of our formalism or its natural extension , such as the tidal overlap integrals ( see pi and ip ) , quantities determining the growth rate due to the cfs instability and decay of inertial waves due different processes , eg . by non - linear mode - mode interactions ( see eg .",
    "schenk et al 2002 , arras et al 2003 ) .",
    "thus , the formalism developed here may provide a basis for the analytic treatment of inertial waves in many different astrophysical applications .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we briefly review the basic equations and their linearised form for a uniformly rotating barotropic planet or star . in section [ anelastic ]",
    "we go on to consider these in the anelastic approximation which is appropriate when the rotation frequency of the star is very much less than the critical or break up rotation frequency .",
    "we give a simple physical argument why we expect this approximation to be valid in this limit even when the sound speed tends to a small value or possibly zero at the surface of the configuration .",
    "in section [ sec2.5 ] we give a brief discussion about when discrete normal modes may be expected to occur such as in the case of a coreless slowly rotating planet with surface boundary assumed to be either spherical or ellipsoidal .",
    "we then present a formal first order perturbation theory that can be used to estimate corrections to eigenfrequencies occurring as either a consequence of terms neglected in the wkbj approximation or the anelastic approximation .",
    "the latter application is tested by a direct comparison with the results of numerical simulations in pin .",
    "section [ sec2.6 ] concludes with a brief account of the form of the anelastic equations in pseudo - spheroidal coordinates in which they become separable for density profiles of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the local radius , @xmath15 is the surface radius and @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "( arras et al 2003 , wu 2005a ) .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we develop a wkbj approximation for calculating the normal modes which is based on the idea that in the short wavelength limit these modes coincide with those appropriate to separable cases which include the homogeneous incompressible sphere as a well known example .",
    "solutions of a general wkbj form appropriate to the interior of the sphere are matched to solutions appropriate to the surface regions where they become separable which is the case when the density vanishes as a power of the distance to the boundary as is expected for a polytropic equation of state .",
    "this matching results in an expression for the eigenfrequencies given in section [ sec3.5 ] .",
    "in section [ surface ] we go on to develop expressions for the eigenfunctions appropriate to any location in the planet including the rotation axis and the critical latitude region where one of the inertial mode characteristics is tangential to the planet surface .",
    "these solutions are then used to obtain corrections to the eigenfrequencies resulting from density gradient terms neglected in the initial wkbj approximation in section [ sec3.9 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we compare the corrected eigenfrequencies obtained from the wkbj approximation with those obtained numerically by several different authors who used differing numerical approaches and find good agreement even for global modes .",
    "a similar comparison with the results of numerical simulations for a polytropic model with positive results is reported in pin .",
    "we also compare the forms of the eigenfunctions with those obtained in ivanov & papaloizou ( 2007 ) and find a good agreement even for global modes .",
    "finally in section [ sec5.1 ] we discuss our results in the context of the evaluation of the overlap integrals that occur in evaluating the response to tidal forcing .",
    "we show that these vanish smoothly in the limit that the polytropic index tends to zero and we indicate that they vanish at the lowest wkbj order and are thus expected to vanish rapidly as the order of the mode increases .",
    "we go on to summarize our conclusions in section [ conclu ] .",
    "in this section we review the formalism and equations we adopt in this paper .",
    "as much of this has been presented in previous work ( pi , ip ) only a brief review is given here .    in what follows",
    "we continue to investigate oscillations of a uniformly rotating fully convective body referred hereafter to as a planet , focusing on the low frequency branch associated with inertial waves .",
    "the planet is characterised by its mass @xmath4 , radius @xmath5 and the associated characteristic frequency @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we adopt a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath18 and associated spherical coordinate system @xmath19 with origin at the centre of mass of the planet .    in this paper",
    "we make use of the fourier transform of a general perturbation quantity , say q , with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath20 and the time @xmath21 in the form @xmath22 where the sum is over @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding quantity hereafter .",
    "the reality of @xmath26 implies that the fourier transform , indicated by tilde satisfies @xmath27 the inner products of two complex scalars @xmath28 , @xmath29 , that are functions of @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath21 are defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "note that the definition of the inner product differs from what is given in ip where the planet s density @xmath34 was used as a weight function .",
    "integrals of this type are always taken over the section @xmath35 of the unperturbed planet for which @xmath36      we assume that the planet is rotating with uniform angular velocity @xmath37 .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for the perturbed quantities take the simplest form in the rotating frame with @xmath31 axis along the direction of rotation .",
    "since the planet is fully convective , the entropy per unit of mass of the planetary gas remains approximately the same over the volume of the planet , and the pressure @xmath38 can be considered as a function of density @xmath39 only , thus @xmath40 .",
    "as the characteristic oscillation periods associated with inertial modes are in general significantly shorter than the global thermal timescale we may adopt the approximation that perturbations of the planet can be assumed to be adiabatic .",
    "then the relation @xmath40 holds during perturbation as well leading to a barotropic equation of state . in the barotropic approximation",
    "the linearised euler equations take the form ( see pi ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the lagrangian displacement vector , @xmath44 is the density perturbation , @xmath45 is the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath46 is the stellar gravitational potential arising from the perturbations and @xmath47 is an external forcing potential , say , the tidal potential in the problem of excitation of inertial waves by tides , see pi and ip .",
    "the linearised continuity equation is @xmath48    note that the centrifugal term is absent in equation @xmath49 being formally incorporated into the potential governing the static equilibrium of the unperturbed star .",
    "the convective derivative @xmath50 as there is no unperturbed motion in the rotating frame .",
    "although incorporation of the perturbation to the internal gravitational potential presents no principal difficulty , in this paper , for simplicity we neglect it , setting @xmath51 . this procedure known as the cowling approximation",
    "can be formally justified in the case when perturbations of small spatial scale in the wkbj limit are considered .",
    "however , it turns out that when low frequency inertial modes are considered the cowling approximation has been found to lead to results which are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with those obtained numerically for global modes obtained with a proper treatment of perturbations to the gravitational potential ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that the use of the cowling approximation can significantly influence our main conclusions .",
    "provided that the expressions for the density and sound speed are specified for some unperturbed model of the planet , the set of equations @xmath52 is complete .",
    "now we express the lagrangian displacement vector and the density perturbation in terms of @xmath53 with help of equations @xmath49 and @xmath54 , and substitute the result into the continuity equation from which we obtain an equation for its fourier transform in the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 @xmath58 it is very important to note that the operators @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are self - adjoint when the inner product @xmath62 with @xmath63 denoting the volume of the star . here",
    "these operators are assumed to act on well behaved functions and the density is taken to vanish at the surface boundary .",
    "also when @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath60 are positive definite and @xmath61 is non negative .",
    "when @xmath66 @xmath65 remains positive definite if consideration is restricted to the physically acceptable variations @xmath53 that conserve mass , this constraint eliminating the possibility that @xmath53 is constant .",
    "when the cowling approximation is adopted equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) fully specifies solutions to the problem of forced linear perturbations of a rotating barotropic planet . in the general case , a complete set of equations",
    "is described in pi .      when @xmath67 equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) leads to an eigenvalue problem describing the free oscillations of a rotating star in the form @xmath68    assuming that rotation of the planet is relatively slow such that the angular velocity @xmath69 , these may be classified as @xmath70 or @xmath7 modes with eigenfrequencies such that @xmath71 or inertial modes with eigenfrequencies @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath7 modes exist in non rotating stars and can be treated in a framework of perturbation theory taking advantage of the small parameter @xmath73 ( see eg . ivanov @xmath0 papaloizou 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand for inertial waves @xmath74 is of order unity , such a perturbation approach can not be used . since , in general , equation ( [ eq 41 ] ) is rather complicated even for numerical solution , in order to make it more tractable the so - called anelastic approximation has been frequently used ( see eg .",
    "pp , lockitch & friedman 1999 and dintrans & ouyed 2001 ) for which the right hand side of ( [ eq 41 ] ) is neglected .    in order to justify this approximation",
    "we note that for eigenfunctions that are non singular everywhere in the planet , we can crudely estimate the derivatives entering equation ( [ eq 41 ] ) as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where the parameter @xmath77 .",
    "consider first the interior region of the planet where we approximately have @xmath78 .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eq 41 ] ) that the left hand side and the right hand side can be respectively estimated as @xmath79 the ratio of these is of order @xmath80 this estimate is , however , not valid near the boundary of the planet where @xmath81 and the left hand side of the inequality ( [ eqn3 ] ) diverges .",
    "however , in the same limit the terms containing the density gradient on the left hand side of ( [ eq 41 ] ) will dominate terms involving the second derivatives of @xmath82 .",
    "thus in this limit the magnitude of the contribution from terms on the left hand side of ( [ eq 4 ] ) may be estimated to be @xmath83 where we remark that it follows from hydrostatic equilibrium that close to the surface @xmath84 accordingly , when @xmath85 the ratio of the terms on the right and left hand sides of equation ( [ eq 41 ] ) can be estimated as @xmath86 from equations ( [ eqn3 ] ) and ( [ eqn5 ] ) it follows that when @xmath87 the terms determining deviation from the anelastic approximation are small compared to the leading terms everywhere in the planet .",
    "accordingly , in the slow rotation regime , we can use this approximation to find the leading order solutions for eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions and then proceed to regard the terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq 41 ] ) as a perturbation .",
    "the validity of the anelastic approximation in the context of the tidal excitation of inertial modes has been recently questioned in a recent paper by goodman & lackner ( 2009 ) on account of the divergence of the terms on the right hand side of equation([eq 41 ] ) as @xmath88 although an actual demonstration of its failure was not given .",
    "in fact the above discussion , which also applies to equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) as this differs only by the addition of a forcing term , indicates that these terms are never important provided @xmath89 is sufficiently small .",
    "this is to be expected because as @xmath90 is reduced , the structure of the modes remains unaffected in the anelastic approximation whereas the radial width of the region where terms on the right hand side of equation([eq 41 ] ) might become comparable to any other terms shrinks to zero .",
    "we also note that the vanishing of the normal velocity at the boundary in the anelastic approximation is correct in the limit @xmath91 as the ratio of the horizontal to normal components there can be shown using the above arguments to also be on the order of @xmath92 finally in pin , we find by comparing the results of tidal forcing calculations using a spectral approach with the anelastic approximation , to those obtained using direct numerical solution of the initial value problem , that it gives good results even when @xmath89 is not very small .",
    "it was shown by pi and ip that both quite generally and also when the anelastic approximation is used equations ( [ eq 4 ] ) and ( [ eq 41 ] ) can be brought to the standard form leading to an eigenvalue problem for a self - adjoint operator . here",
    "we describe the approach , which leads to the self - adjoint formulation of the problem in the anelastic approximation .",
    "the self - adjoint and non negative character of the operators @xmath65 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 is made use of to formally introduce their square roots , eg .",
    "@xmath93 , defined by condition @xmath94 , etc .",
    "as is standard , the requirement of non negativity , makes the definitions of these square roots unique .",
    "the positive definiteness of @xmath65 ( see above discussion ) also allows definition of the inverse of @xmath93 , @xmath95 .",
    "let us consider a new generalised two dimensional vector @xmath96 with components such that @xmath97 and the straightforward generalisation of the inner product given by equation ( [ eq 7 ] ) .",
    "it is now easy to see that equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath98 where @xmath99 and the vector @xmath100 has the components @xmath101 note that as follows from ( [ eq 12 ] ) the relation between the components of @xmath96 and @xmath102 can be taken to be given by @xmath103 since the off diagonal elements in the matrix ( [ eq 13 ] ) are adjoint of each other and the diagonal elements are self adjoint , it is clear that the operator @xmath104 is self - adjoint .",
    "equation ( [ eq 12 ] ) can be formally solved using the spectral decomposition of @xmath105 we now make a few remarks concerning the spectrum .",
    "it has been known for many years ( see eg .",
    "greenspan 1968 , stewartson @xmath0 rickard 1969 ) that the eigenvalue problem we consider is not well posed in the inertial mode range @xmath106 this is because in this spectral range the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq 41 ] ) becomes a hyperbolic partial differential equation with boundary conditions specified on the planet boundary .",
    "the form of the spectrum depends on the behaviour of the characteristics , which correspond to localised inertial waves , under successive reflections from the boundary .",
    "note that these reflections maintain a constant angle with the rotation axis rather than the normal to the boundary .",
    "the situation was conveniently summarised by wood ( 1977 ) ( see also fokin 1994a , b and references therein ) .",
    "there are three types of behaviour of the characteristic paths for frequencies in the inertial mode range .",
    "they may all close forming periodic trajectories , they may be ergodic , or there may be a finite number of periodic trajectories that form attractors .",
    "the first two types of behaviour are believed to be associated with discrete normal modes while the third type leads to wave attractors and a continuous spectrum . the homogeneous sphere within a spherical or ellipsoidal boundary exhibits the first two kinds of behaviour and has discrete normal modes which form a dense spectrum ( eg .",
    "bryan 1889 ) while the same system with a solid core has wave attractors ( eg .",
    "ogilvie & lin 2004 , ogilvie 2009 ) .",
    "note the characteristics behave in the same way for all spheres or ellipsoids with a continuous density distribution so that these should have normal modes .",
    "note too that in the limit of very short wavelength modes only the second derivative terms matter in equation ( [ eq 41 ] ) and the system becomes equivalent to the two dimensional case studied by ralston ( 1973 ) and schaeffer ( 1975 ) . in that case",
    "the normal modes are associated with the frequencies for which all characteristic paths are periodic .",
    "they form a dense spectrum and are infinitely degenerate . from this discussion",
    "we expect the modes of a system with a continuous density distribution to approach the same form as those of the homogeneous sphere , an aspect upon which we build our later wkbj approach .      from the above discussion",
    "we expect the normal modes for the cases of interest to form a discrete but dense spectrum .",
    "the anelastic approximation can be implemented by setting @xmath107 in equation ( [ eqn6 ] ) . in this case",
    "we can look for a solution to ( [ eq 12 ] ) in the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 are the real eigenfunctions of @xmath104 satisfying @xmath110 the associated necessarily real eigenfrequencies being @xmath111    substituting ( [ eq 14 ] ) into ( [ eq 12 ] ) we obtain @xmath112 the operator @xmath104 induces the inner product and associated orthogonality relation for eigenfunctions according to the rule @xmath113 where @xmath114 using ( [ eqn6 ] ) and ( [ eq 15 ] ) we explicitly obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the norm .",
    "the decomposition ( [ eq 13a ] ) should be valid for any vector @xmath117 with components @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is any function of the spatial coordinates .",
    "the second component of this equality shows that in order for this to be valid an identity @xmath120 must be hold ( ip ) .",
    "this identity allows us to represent the relation ( [ eq 16 ] ) in a different form ( pi ) : @xmath121 note that in response problems such as the problem of excitation of the inertial waves during the periastron flyby , in order to take account of causality issues correctly when extending to the complex @xmath122 plane , one should add a small imaginary part in the resonance denominator in ( [ eq 16b ] ) according to the landau prescription : @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a small real quantity .",
    "when external forces are absent and the potential @xmath125 is set to zero , equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) ( or , alternatively , equation ( [ eq 12 ] ) ) defines the full eigenvalue problem . under very general assumptions",
    "it was shown by ip that this problem can be formally solved in an analogous manner . however , it is rather difficult to use the general expressions obtained by ip without making further approximations .",
    "here we note that , given that the spectrum is discrete , we may find conditions satisfied by the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues by replacing @xmath125 by @xmath126 in equations ( [ eq 16 ] ) and ( [ eq 16b ] ) .",
    "these conditions relate any eigenfunction , now equated to @xmath127 and its associated eigenvalue @xmath122 to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the anelastic problem . proceeding in this way we go on to form the quantity @xmath128 where @xmath129 is an anelastic eigenfunction and we have made use of the orthogonality relation ( [ eqn7 ] ) .",
    "as argued in section [ anelastic ] , the quantity on the right hand side can be regarded as a perturbation where the small parameter is @xmath130 provided an eigenfunction can be identified as @xmath131 and is non degenerate with @xmath132 it follows from ( [ eqn16c ] ) that in this limit    @xmath133    where @xmath134 .",
    "the spectrum of inertial modes is dense .",
    "this may lead to a potential difficulties in identifying and following modes as parameters change as we discussed above .",
    "however , it is possible to argue that this problem can be alleviated for large scale global modes by for example modifying the eigenvalue problem by adding terms that have a very small effect on the global modes but spectrally separate close by short scale modes .",
    "dintrans and ouyed ( 2001 ) adopt such a procedure by adding a viscosity and this enables them to identify and follow global modes .",
    "note that a similar situation would result if conservative high order derivative terms were added that preserved the self - adjoint form of the problem .",
    "numerical work presented below and in pin also confirms that global modes have a clear identity and can be followed as parameters change provided that the angular frequency is sufficiently small .",
    "thus we both expect and verify the validity of the expression ( [ eqn16d ] ) in this limit . for larger values of @xmath2",
    "one should take into account a possibility of mixing between two neighbouring large scale global modes to explain results of numerical calculations , see pin . in this case expression ( [ eqn16d ] ) should be modified in an appropriate way .      in the next section",
    "we find solutions of the eigenvalue problem in the wkbj approximation .",
    "it will be shown that the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenmodes are independent of the sign of @xmath12 to two leading orders .",
    "this is explained by the fact that to that order solutions are determined only by operators containing second and first derivatives in equation ( [ eq 4 ] ) . on the other hand it follows from the same equation that the only dependence on sign of @xmath12 is determined by the operator @xmath60 which does not contain any derivatives of @xmath53 .    in order to find the first correction to the wkbj eigenfrequencies that depends on sign of @xmath135 we treat the operator @xmath60 as a perturbation .",
    "this leads to a change in the eigenfrequency that can be found by using the same formalism that lead to equation ( [ eqn16d ] ) but then simply replacing @xmath136 in that equation by @xmath137 equation ( [ eqn16d ] ) then gives @xmath138 note that since @xmath139 it follows from equation ( [ eqnn2 ] ) that when @xmath140 the sign of @xmath141 is proportional to the sign of @xmath12 .      in what follows",
    "we assume that an object experiencing tidal interactions can be approximated as having a spherically symmetric structure .",
    "in this case it is appropriate to use another form of ( [ eq 4 ] ) with @xmath142 , which is especially convenient for an analysis of wkbj solutions .",
    "we can obtain this from ( [ eq 4 ] ) using the fact that for a spherical star @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",

    "there are , however , three unidentified modes for the case @xmath489 as well as for @xmath497 .",
    "these modes have frequencies concentrating near the borders of the allowed frequency range with @xmath518 as well as in the region close to @xmath519 it is possible that although these correspond to global modes for the incompressible @xmath520 model , these do not retain their character when @xmath521 is increased to @xmath241 and beyond through a strong coupling to short wavelength modes nearby in eigenfrequency ( see discussion in section [ sec2.5 ] ) . discarding these modes ,",

    "this is especially good for the main global mode represented in the plots on the left hand side .",

    "although there is a disagreement in position of the spot close to the critical latitude , which is situated on the planet s surface in the case of the exact analytic solutions and slightly interior to the surface of the planet in the case of the wkbj distributions , there is a similarity in the distributions in the planet s interior .",

    "this fact , however , is not obvious for the integral written in the form ( [ eqn84a ] ) because close to the surface we have @xmath579 with the constant @xmath175 converging to a nonzero value as @xmath580 therefore , as the eigenfunctions are regular , the integral @xmath581 has a logarithmic divergence at the surface of the planet as @xmath580 this raises the possibility that the overlap integral might converge to a nonzero value or behave pathologically as the incompressible limit is approached .    in order to show that , in fact , this is not so and @xmath582 in a smooth manner , let us consider some fiducial models having the property that the quantity @xmath583 is constant . for models in hydrostatic equilibrium under their own gravity ,",
    "constancy of @xmath584 implies that ratio @xmath585 , where @xmath150 is the mass interior to the radius @xmath586 is constant .",
    "the model must accordingly be incompressible .",
    "goodman @xmath0 lackner ( 2009 ) obtained a wider class of models in hydrostatic equilibrium under a fixed quadratic gravitational potential .",
    "because the potential is fixed independently of the mass distribution and there are no constraints on the equation of state , such models may be constructed for an arbitrary density distribution .",
    "now let use consider the integral @xmath587 for the fiducial models described above this is identical to the overlap integral ( [ eqn84a ] ) where we note that we may adopt natural units such that the constant @xmath588 which should be identified with the surface value of @xmath589 is equal to unity in that case .",
    "more generally the integrand in ( [ eqn84b ] ) can be transformed using equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ good1 ] ) such that @xmath590    now let us consider equation ( [ eq 41 ] ) for free normal modes in the anelastic approximation by setting @xmath591 and the right hand side of this equation to zero .",
    "then we multiply it by @xmath592 , set @xmath488 , and integrate over @xmath593 . after removing derivatives of @xmath594 by integrating by parts , assuming that the density vanishes at the surface boundary , it is easy to see that it follows from ( [ eq 41 ] ) that @xmath595 in the anelastic approximation provided @xmath596",
    "this means , in particular , that @xmath488 inertial waves can not be excited in the goodman @xmath0 lackner ( 2009 ) models in this approximation as was found by these authors when compressibility was fully taken into account ( see pin for additional discussion ) .",
    "using the fact that @xmath595 we may rewrite ( [ eqn84a ] ) for models under their own self - gravity quite generally , adopting natural units , as @xmath597 taking into account that the factor in the brackets is proportional to @xmath357 for small @xmath357 , and , accordingly , in this limit the integrand is proportional to @xmath598 we see that now the logarithmic divergence of @xmath599 disappears and , therefore , it is clear from the representation ( [ eqn84d ] ) that the overlap integral indeed smoothly tends to zero in the limit @xmath578 .",
    "the theory of asymptotic evaluation of integrals of the form ( [ eqn84d ] ) tells that the values of such integrals are determined either by inner stationary points , where gradient of the wkbj phase vanishes or contributions close to the surface or other parts of the integration domain , where the wkbj approximation is not valid . from the expression of the @xmath571 in the wkbj regime ( [ eqn30 ] ) it follows that there are no stationary points in the inner region of the planet .",
    "considering the regions close to the surface it appears to be reasonable to assume that the leading contribution is determined by the region close to the critical latitude , where a hot spot is observed in distributions of @xmath594 , see the previous section . in this region the quantities @xmath600 and @xmath601 are small .",
    "we can use them as new integration variables in ( [ eqn84d ] ) with help of ( [ eqn66 ] ) , separate the contribution of this region to the integral by introduction of the functions @xmath602 $ ] defined in section 3.7 in the integrand , and decompose the quantities in front of @xmath594 in powers of @xmath603 taking into account that @xmath604 and @xmath605 in the leading order . assuming that @xmath606 , where @xmath430 is given by equation ( [ eqn60 ] ) , it is easy to see that the leading contribution to ( [ eqn84 ] ) is given by a symmetric combination of two integrals involving bessel functions @xmath607 where @xmath608y^{n}j_{(n-1)/2}(\\kappa y ) ,   \\quad i_{2}(y)=\\int_{y=0}dy \\eta[y]y^{(n+1)}j_{(n-1)/2}(\\kappa y ) , \\label{eqn84j}\\ ] ] where it is assumed that @xmath609=0 $ ] , @xmath439 lies within the range of integration and @xmath610 . as was shown by larichev ( 1973 ) the integral @xmath611 for any particular form of the function @xmath612 $ ] .",
    "thus , the leading order contribution to the overlap integral from the surface region close to the critical latitude is equal to zero . in principal , one can look for the next order terms .",
    "however , in this case our simple approach to the problem seems to be inadequate since eg .",
    "the assumption that @xmath571 can be represented as a product of two functions separately depending on the coordinates may be broken at this level , etc .. a more accurate approach is left for a future work .",
    "we note , however , that this cancellation means that the overlap integral should decay rapidly with increasing @xmath318 possibly being inversely proportional to a large power of @xmath613 this may qualitatively explain why a small number of relatively large scale modes are significantly excited by dynamic tides , see pi , ip and pin .      in this paper",
    "we have developed a wkbj approximation , together with a formal first order perturbation approach for calculating the normal modes of a uniformly rotating coreless planet under the assumption of a spherically symmetric structure .",
    "matching of the general wkbj form valid in the interior to separable solutions valid near the surface resulted in expressions for eigenfunctions that were valid at any location within the planet together with an expression for the associated eigenfrequencies given in section [ sec3.5 ] .",
    "corrections as a result of density gradient terms neglected in the initial wkbj approach were also obtained from formal first order perturbation theory .",
    "the corrected wkbj eigenfrequencies obtained using the wkbj eigenfunctions were compared with results obtained numerically by several different authors and found to be in good agreement , away from the limits of the inertial mode spectrum where identifications could be made , even for modes with a global structure .",
    "we also compared the spatial forms of the eigenfunctions with those obtained using the spectral method described in ip finding similar good agreement .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that these global modes can be identified and that first order perturbation theory works even though they are embedded in a dense spectrum .    in further support of this",
    ", the formal first order perturbation theory developed here is subsequently used to estimate corrections to the eigenfrequencies as a consequence of the anelastic approximation and is then compared with simulation results for a polytropic model with @xmath476 in pin .",
    "these different approaches are found to be in agreement for small enough rotation frequencies and also indicates that , as implied by the simplified discussion in section [ anelastic ] of this paper , that corrections as a result of the anelastic approximation are never very significant for the models adopted .",
    "our results show that the problem of finding eigenfrequencies and eigenvalues of inertial modes allows for an approximate analytical treatment , even in the case of modes having a large scale distribution of perturbed quantities .",
    "although we consider only the case of a polytropic planet , our formalism can be applied to a much wider context .",
    "indeed , the approach developed here is mainly determined by the form of the density close to planet s surface , where we assume that it is proportional to a power of distance from the surface .",
    "thus , we expect that our main results remain unchanged for any density distribution , which is approximately power - law close to the surface .",
    "in particular , according to our results , all models of type having approximately the same behaviour of the density distribution close to the surface should have approximately the same eigenspectrum .",
    "the formalism developed here can be extended for an approximate analytic evaluation of different quantities associated with inertial modes , such as overlap integrals characterising interaction of inertial waves with different physical fields , growth rates due to the cfs instability and decay rates due to various viscous interactions and non - linear mode - mode interaction .",
    "it may provide a basis for a perturbative analytic analysis of more complicated models , such as realistic models of star and planets flattened by rotation or models of relativistic stars .    as we discussed above , for a given value of wkbj order , @xmath614 some modes are identified with modes obtained numerically while others remain unidentified .",
    "eigenfrequencies of the unidentified modes are always either situated close to the boundaries of the frequency range allowed for inertial modes , @xmath615 or situated close to the origin @xmath616 .",
    "we believe that our theory is not applicable to these modes , and they develop a small scale contribution controlled by the closeness of the positions of their eigenfrequencies to @xmath616 and @xmath617 and thus effectively move to higher order than allowed for .",
    "accordingly we de not consider these modes when comparing our results with results of direct numerical calculations of the excitation of inertial waves due to a tidal encounter reported in pin .",
