    "the accretion disk model by shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 , hereafter , ssd ) has been regarded as the `` standard '' model for the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and galactic black - hole candidates ( gbhcs ) in their soft state .",
    "their analytical solutions are self - consistent under some specific assumptions . however , when its luminosity @xmath21 approaches the eddington luminosity , @xmath13 , some assumptions break down and thus the standard model can not adequately describe the nature of such high luminosity objects . the critical luminosity is @xmath22 ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 , laor , netzer 1989 ) .",
    "this fact is theoretically established but not widely known and still most of investigations have been conducted by simply applying the canonical ssd even to near - eddington luminosity systems without any comments .",
    "recent observations have detected several kinds of exotic super - eddington sources , whose luminosity seemingly exceeds the eddington luminosity .",
    "the properties of their energy source can not be described by the ssd theory , and hence its origin is still an open astrophysical question .",
    "the nature of super - eddington sources has been discussed in relation to their x - ray properties since late 1980 s ( fabbiano , 1989 ) .",
    "for instance , ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources ( hereafter , ulxs ) in nearby spiral galaxies are very mysterious objects",
    ". their luminosities amount to around @xmath23 , which means the mass ( @xmath24 ) of black holes , if they exist , should exceed 10100 @xmath25 .",
    "however , the mcd ( multi - color disk , mitsuda et al . 1984 ) fitting derives relatively high temperatures , @xmath26 kev ( mizuno et al .",
    "1999 , makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) , compared with the theoretical expectations based on the ssd model , which is significantly below 1.0 kev for @xmath27 . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the color temperature derived from the observed spectrum ( for the exact definition , see section 3.3 . ) . in our galaxy",
    ", there exists a famous galactic microquasar , grs 1915 + 105 , which shows the complicated time / spectral variation .",
    "its luminosity is near the eddington luminosity in its high state @xmath28 ( belloni et al .",
    "these objects can never be explained in the framework of the ssd theory . on the theoretical side ,",
    "there has been growing recognition that the super - critical accretion disk model , so - called `` slim disk '' ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) may be a correct model to describe these high luminosity objects .",
    "its significance has been re - recognized in connection with luminous agns ( szuszkiewicz et al .",
    "1996 , wang et al . 1999 ) , narrow - line seyfert1 galaxies ( nls1s ; mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ) , and gbhcs shining near the eddington luminosity ( fukue 2000 , watarai et al .",
    "2000 ) , since the disk is stable due to the advective entropy transport , even at the super - critical accretion rates .",
    "the ulxs are discussed along this line in the first time by watarai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and it has been shown to explain the basic observed tendency , although more detailed analysis is needed ( watarai in preparation ) .    the local stability against thermal perturbations can be discussed in terms of the thermal equilibrium curve , so called  s - shaped \" curve ( taam , lin 1986 , abramowicz et al .",
    "the local stability properties for the stationary slim disk models with different viscosity prescriptions were discussed by szuszkiewicz ( 1990 ) , who found that when ",
    "@xmath10 \" increases the thermally unstable region in the disk becomes smaller . here , we prescribe viscous - shear tensor , the different form of shear stress tensor to be , @xmath29 , ( @xmath7 is the gas pressure , and @xmath8 is the total pressure ) , where @xmath10 is the parameter ( @xmath30 ) .    the global stability analysis for slim disk model has been carried out by honma et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who found that the disk was stabilized as the viscosity parameter  @xmath10 \" increased .",
    "szuszkiewicz and miller ( 1997 ) confirmed this finding , showing that the models are stable not only when they are locally stable but also when the local analysis predicts an unstable region with radial dimension smaller than the shortest wavelength of the unstable modes . in the most recent study by zampieri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have calculated the spectra of a slim disk model along one full thermal limit cycle .",
    "however , there is little research that carried out direct comparison with x - ray observations .",
    "our concern in the present study is how the viscosity prescription and its strength act on the structure of accretion disks , and how they manifest themselves in the fitting parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) derived from the observational spectra in soft x - ray band .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be accurately determined from the observation , conversely , the functional form of disk viscosity might be able to constrain .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the structure and spectrum of slim disks is an outstanding issue .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic equations and explain our calculation method . in section 3 ,",
    "the results of our calculation are presented for a variety of viscosity parameters ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the observational features of the slim disk are summarized by using the fitting parameters , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 in section 4 .",
    "final section is devoted to discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "basic equations we use here are all the same as those in the previous paper ( watarai et al . 2000 ) except for the viscosity prescription ( see kato et al .",
    "1998 , chapter 8 for the detailed description ) .",
    "we solved the height - integrated equations ( h@xmath34shi , 1977 ) in the radial direction on the basis of pseudo - newtonian potential ( paczysky , wiita , 1980 ) , and neglected self - gravity .",
    "the pseudo - newtonian potential is not an excellent approximation around the event horizon @xmath35 .",
    "thus , caution is needed when the derived @xmath3 is small , @xmath36 .",
    "other general relativistic effects needs also to take account , then .",
    "otherwise , our approximation does not introduce serious errors .",
    "honma et al .",
    "( 1991 ) were the first to carry out the calculation above circumstances ( including the effect of viscosity prescriptions of the slim disk ) .",
    "the main difference of our calculation and theirs is that they truncated the disk inner edge at 2.7 @xmath17 , while we integrate the disk down to the real vicinity of the event horizon at @xmath17 .",
    "the momentum equation in the radial direction is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radial velocity of gas , @xmath39 is surface density , and @xmath40 is pressure integral , @xmath41 is disk scale height , respectively . here ,",
    "the pressure , @xmath42 , and the density , @xmath43 , are related to each other by the relation @xmath44 ( the subscript ` 0 ' indicates the quantities on the equatorial plane ) .",
    "we fixed the polytropic index to be @xmath45 , for which the numerical constants are @xmath46=16/35 and @xmath47=128/315 ( h@xmath34shi , 1977 ) .",
    "the specific angular momentum and the keplerian angular momentum are defined by @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 , respectively , where @xmath51 is the keplerian angular frequency .",
    "the angular momentum conservation is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is mass accretion rate , @xmath54 from continuity equation and @xmath55 is the height integrated viscous stress tensor , @xmath56 .",
    "hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction leads @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the sound speed .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the gas constant , the mean molecular weight , and the radiation constant respectively . as to the viscosity prescription",
    "we rewrite it in terms of the effective @xmath0 ; @xmath62 this form is convenient to compare with the cases with the usual viscosity prescription ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) . if we take an extreme case of @xmath64 limit , the stress tensor is proportional to total pressure ; i.e. , the same as that of the ssd prescription . in the large @xmath10 limit @xmath65 ,",
    "on the other hand , the shear stress tensor depends solely on gas pressure .",
    "this situation may realize when there grows turbulence generated by chaotic magnetic fields ( lightman , eardley 1974 ; sakimoto , coroniti 1981 ) .",
    "the energy equation involves the viscous heating , radiative cooling and advective cooling terms ; namely , @xmath66 where each term is explicitly written as : @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the entropy on the equatorial plane , @xmath69 is the rosseland - mean opacity , @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 being averaged density and temperature , respectively , @xmath73 and @xmath74 and other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "we solved the above set of equations ( [ ang - mom])([energy ] ) .",
    "the solution is calculated from the outer edge of the disk ( @xmath75 ) to the vicinity of the central black hole through the transonic point .",
    "we adjust @xmath76 , specific angular momentum which is finally swallowed by the black hole , so as to satisfy the regularity condition at the transonic radius .    for evaluating the effective temperature",
    ", we assume that all the radiative energy is emitted with blackbody as a first approximation .",
    "namely , using the stefan - boltzmann s law , @xmath77 , we define the local effective temperature to be @xmath78 as is widely known , however , the effect of compton scattering is substantial in electron scattering dominated layers ( czerny , elvis 1987 ; ross et al .",
    "1992 ; shimura , takahara 1995 ; wang et al .",
    "we include this effect by introducing a spectral hardening factor ( see section . 3.3 . ) .",
    "further , photon trapping effect ( e.g. , mineshige et al . 2000 ) needs to be considered .",
    "however , we ignore these effects in order to understanding the basic tendency of the spectrum .    finally , we define the normalized parameter @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "this definition may differ in different literatures .",
    "in our notation , disk luminosity corresponds to the eddington luminosity , when the accretion rate is @xmath81 ( provided that the pseudo - newtonian potential is used ) .",
    "we vary the normalized parameters , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath0 , and @xmath10 , and calculate the structure of optically thick accretion disk for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we first examine the effects of changing the @xmath0 parameter within the ssd prescription , @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 does not affect significantly the spectrum in the standard disk theory , since total radiation output rate is balanced with the energy generation rate via viscous processes and does not explicitly depend on density nor velocity .",
    "in other words , effective temperatures can be nearly uniquely determined by black - hole mass and mass - accretion rate as functions of radius . in a high accretion - rate system ,",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 dependence appears , since radiative cooling is no longer balanced solely with viscous heating so that the disk inner temperature can change even for the same @xmath24 and @xmath53 .",
