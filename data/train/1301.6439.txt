    "two - dimensional ( @xmath4d ) strongly correlated quantum models have triggered broad interest in last decades as they always exhibit intriguing and exotic properties ( e.g. refs . [ ] ) . accompanied with the boom of quantum information science , some theories @xcite were developed to enable us to describe the critical phenomena beyond the traditional paradigm of landau - ginzburg and renormalization group and to access the information of phase transitions without acquiring knowledge of order parameters or universality class .",
    "for example , the fidelity is shown to be able to determine the ground state phase diagram @xcite , and the scaling law of the entanglement entropy in @xmath4d is utilized to identify the topological orders @xcite .",
    "another issue that is under hot discussion is about the efficient and controllable numerical algorithms for strongly - correlated systems . while reliable analytical methods for such systems are still sparse owing to the complexity of many - body interactions , numerical means play essential roles . among others ,",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite as well as its variants @xcite , tensor network state ( tns ) based algorithms @xcite , and so on , have achieved great success @xcite .",
    "however , qmc is not applicable to the frustrated spin systems and hubbard model away from the half - filling because of the  negative sign \" problem , and dmrg is remarkably accurate and efficient in one dimension but has great costs for @xmath4d systems of large size .",
    "therefore , to develop new theories and efficient algorithms for correlated quantum lattice systems is highly encouraged .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a theory of the network contractor dynamics ( ncd ) that comprises two aspects : three suggested generic in the ncd theory are introduced and shown to be capable of detecting phase transitions , and an efficient and well - controlled algorithm based on the ncd theory for investigating the thermodynamic properties of @xmath4d quantum lattice models is proposed .",
    "it is demonstrated that the ncd theory is flexible and applicable to the models which can be represented in the form of a tensor network @xcite , e.g. the @xmath4d heisenberg and ising models .",
    "the primary strategy is as follows .",
    "first , we represent the density operator at an infinitesimal inverse temperature in the form of tensor product density operator ( tpdo ) , with which the density operator at finite temperatures can be simulated by imaginary time evolution @xcite .",
    "then the partition function @xmath5 as well as the thermal averages of observable operators @xmath6 can be calculated by contracting all shared bonds in the 2d tpdo . in this course , there are two unavoidable difficulties that both involve in an infinite contraction of the tn which can not be exactly achieved : ( a ) the evolution procedure will increase exponentially the bond space of the tpdo ; ( b ) the calculations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the targeted temperature include infinite contractions of the tn .",
    "our general strategy to deal with these difficulties is to make the infinite contraction by that of a local cluster with proper vectors on its boundary . to be specific ,",
    "we first obtain the tn of the partition function from the tpdo , and then consider a properly selected cluster of tensors in this tn as one tensor such that it is the only inequivalent tensor in the tn .",
    "such a tensor ( denoted by @xmath7 ) can be regarded as a nonlinear mapping over the spaces of different bonds . by using the fixed point of such a mapping that is referred to as the _ contractor _ and denoted as @xmath8",
    ", we manage to simplify the calculations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 as local contractions of @xmath7 s and @xmath8 .",
    "the simplification of calculating truncations is similar .",
    "an imaginary - time - sweep algorithm for implementation of the ncd theory is proposed , which is free from the negative sign problem and whose errors can be well controlled .",
    "the results calculated by the ncd scheme for the ising model on square lattice spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) on honeycomb lattice are nicely compared with the exact results and other methods as well as the qmc simulations , showing the efficiency and accuracy of this method .",
    "an imaginary - time sweep algorithm is proposed for the implementation of the ncd theory .",
    "we show that the three parts of the error are well - controlled . like other algorithms ( e.g. refs . [ ] ) , the error brought by the trotter - suzuki decomposition is controlled by the imaginary time slice and the truncation error controlled by the discarding weight , but there is no quantity to show how far the truncation is from the global optimal one , i.e. , to control the error of the truncation ( comparing with the global optimal truncation ) . in the ncd scheme ,",
    "all three parts are well - controlled , while the last one is controlled by the loop character .",
    "we argue that when the loop character decays to zero , the effect of larger loops ( which are destroyed ) is negligible and the truncation can be considered as globally optimal .    within the framework of the ncd ,",
    "the quasi - entanglement entropy @xmath1 defined by the transfer matrix of the partition function , lyapunov exponent @xmath2 that quantifies the convergent properties of the introduced non - linear mapping , and the loop character @xmath3 describing the loop - dependence of the tensor networks are introduced to characterize the properties of the tns .",
    "it is found that these three quantities describe the nonlocality of the quantum states , and are able to detect possible thermodynamic phase transitions of both the classical and quantum systems , as manifested by the square ising model and the spin-1/2 anisotropic honeycomb haf model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly present the equivalence between the finite temperature density operator and a tn . in sec .",
    "iii , the theory of ncd is introduced based on the tn representation . in sec .",
    "iv , a way to increase the cell tensor size in the ncd , the quasi - entanglement entropy and the loop character are proposed . in sec .",
    "v , we suggest the imaginary - time - sweep algorithm for the implementation of the ncd theory . in sec .",
    "vi , we test the accuracy of the ncd scheme on the square ising model and the spin @xmath9 haf on honeycomb lattice and show that the three quantities , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 are able to detect possible thermodynamic phase transitions .",
    "finally , a summary is given .",
    "in this section , we show the equivalence between the finite temperature density operator and a tensor network . henceforth , we take the haf on honeycomb lattice as an example , and the following discussions below can be readily extended to other 2d lattices .",
    "suppose that the hamiltonian of a quantum lattice model with nearest neighbor couplings can be written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the local hamiltonian of two connected spins at @xmath12th and @xmath13th lattice sites .",
    "the calculation of the finite temperature density operator @xmath14 can be transformed into the contraction of a three - dimensional tn as follows .",
    "let us begin with introducing the local evolution operator @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the infinitesimal imaginary time slice , @xmath17 is the local basis of the @xmath12th spin and @xmath18 denotes the physical bond . by using the trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite ,",

    "( e ) the bond @xmath53 of the left @xmath7 connects the bond @xmath43 of the right @xmath7 , thus @xmath43 and @xmath53 form an index pair . ]",

    ", we can transform the 2d tn so that it consists of only one inequivalent tensor @xmath7 , and then introduce a set of unit - norm vectors which satisfy the fixed point equations of the mapping defined by @xmath7 .",
    "the vectors at the fixed point are dubbed as _ contractors_. by substituting the tn with a tree - like defective tn , we obtain @xmath54 in terms of a simple local contraction of @xmath7 and the contractors .    by contracting the two inequivalent tensors into one tensor @xmath7 in the tn [ fig .",

    "it should be remarked that the rank-1 tensor that appears in the defective tn is @xmath93 , which equals to @xmath94 with permutation invariance in each index pair .",

    "thus , more loops recovered , more missing terms retrieved , and consequently , a higher accuracy can be achieved .",
    "however , the computational cost to contract such a cluster increases exponentially with the number of the loops inside , so in the following we shall propose an available scheme to recover the infinite loops . by doing so , eq .",
    "( [ eq - oi ] ) should be modified correspondingly .    up to now",

    "we use @xmath110 to denote the cell tensor containing @xmath111 cell tensors of the smallest size ( denoted by @xmath95 ) , where @xmath111 is called the cell tensor size .",
    "the ncd scheme can be directly used with @xmath110 as it gives no restriction for the choice of the cell tensor . meanwhile",

    ", we can see that the tpdo bears high loop dependence , i.e. the effects from the loops of cell tensors can be ignored only when the size of cell tensor @xmath111 is large enough in the critical vicinity , which is coincident with the non - locality .",
    "@xmath2 can be understood in the defective scheme . with a large @xmath2",
    ", one can map any vectors close to the fixed point ( the contractors @xmath236 ) by acting the mapping @xmath237 for great times [ eq . ( [ eq - fixedpoint ] ) ] .",
    "one can see that one time of the mapping is equivalent to the contraction of one @xmath7 and the vectors for generating a new vector in the defective tn .",
    "the larger the @xmath2 is , the more time of the mapping is needed to reach the fixed point , which corresponds to the contraction of a larger defective tn .",
    "so the @xmath2 is relatively large in the critical vicinity , which is also coincident with the non - locality of the state .",
    "in summary , we developed the ncd theory for exploring the thermodynamic properties of @xmath4d quantum lattice models , and proposed the itsa that is free from the negative sign problem for the numerical realization of ncd scheme .",
    "we benchmark the accuracy of the ncd scheme on the square ising model and then calculate the thermodynamics of the spin-1/2 haf on honeycomb lattice as an example , which are found consistent well with the exact results and the qmc simulations , respectively .",
    "new characters such as the quasi - entanglement entropy , lyapunov exponent and loop character are introduced to describe properties of the thermal states and can be utilized to detect possible thermodynamic phase transitions of both classical and quantum systems .",
