    "within the last few years , it has become more and more obvious that the milky way stellar halo is dominated by substructure , particularly dwarf galaxies , clouds , and tidal tails .",
    "data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed abundant examples of streams and substructure .",
    "for example , @xcite used a simple colour cut @xmath2 to map out the distribution of stars in sdss data release  5 ( dr5 ) .",
    "the `` field of streams '' , an rgb - composite image composed of magnitude slices of the stellar density of these stars , showed the overlap of the leading and trailing arm of the well - known sagittarius stream and the monoceros ring very clearly .",
    "also prominent was a new stream , which did not have an identified progenitor , and was called the `` orphan stream '' by  @xcite .",
    "the observational data on the orphan stream  @xcite was used by @xcite to argue that its progenitor may be the newly - discovered disrupting dwarf galaxy uma  ii  @xcite .",
    "tidal tails have proved to be an important diagnostic of the galactic potential .",
    "especially the tails of the dissolving sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which wrap around the milky way , are an excellent tracer of the strength and shape of the potential .",
    "@xcite have shown with their numerical models that the bifurcation of the sagittarius stream as seen in the `` field of streams '' is composed of two wraps of the tidal tails and can only be reproduced if the orbital precession is small , i.e.  if the milky way dark matter halo is close to spherical .",
    "extra - tidal extensions and onsets of tidal tails have been claimed around a number of galactic globular clusters in recent years ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most spectacular and convincing discovery remains the long and thin tail from the disrupting globular cluster pal  5 @xcite .",
    "the tails extend at least @xmath3  kpc from the cluster in the leading and trailing direction and contain more mass than the remaining cluster .",
    "recently , two different groups  @xcite claim to have detected tidal tails of various extents around the disrupting globular cluster ngc 5466 .",
    "this is an old , metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath4 ) cluster , lying at galactic coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 . in @xcite ,",
    "the observed tails of ngc  5466 are not as long as those of pal  5 , stretching about @xmath7 or @xmath8  pc in either direction .",
    "@xcite reported afterwards that they found evidence for a much larger extension of the tidal tails of ngc  5466 .",
    "they claimed that the leading arm extends over @xmath9  degrees and the trailing arm extends at least @xmath10  degrees , before it leaves the area covered by sdss .",
    "this finding makes the tails of ngc  5466 even longer , but much fainter , than the tails of pal  5 .",
    "the aim of our paper is to confront these claims with theoretical expectation , as well as to study the survival of the tails .",

    ", values are spread between @xmath21 and @xmath22  pc .",

    ", we describe the setup of our simulations ",
    "namely , the choice of galactic potential models , the orbit of ngc  5466 and finally the initial model of the cluster itself .",
    "this is followed by a study of the relative importance of two - body relaxation and disc shocking in section  [ sec : sbox ] , justifying our use of particle - mesh simulations in this paper .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : res ] , we present simulations that reproduce the shape , extent and surface density of the tidal tails detected by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in addition to the the disc potential , we use the analytic potential corresponding to two spheroidal density distributions for the halo and the bulge in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 we choose the parameters of our db model according to the best - fit model  4 in the paper of @xcite . in fig .",

    "we choose a @xcite sphere : @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the scale - length of the plummer sphere , which is identical to the half - light radius , and @xmath49 the total mass .",
    "this is a fairly good representation of a star cluster , especially a young one .",
    "due to tidal shaping and internal evolution at later stages , a @xcite model usually fits the photometric data better .",
    "the advantage of a plummer model is that all physical quantities are analytically accessible .",
    "the initial plummer model has a half - light radius of @xmath50  pc , an initial mass of @xmath51  m@xmath16 and is represented by @xmath52 particles .",
    "the numerical set - up of the particles is performed using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "we checked that our initial model is able to survive for a hubble time by comparing our initial configuration with the dissolution times given in @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "as the orbit of ngc  5466 is most of the time located far out in the halo , it is well represented by the uppermost lines in @xcite , giving us a dissolution time of a few hubble times .",
    "kpc.,height=302 ]    to determine the orbit of ngc  5466 , we use the positions and proper motion from the literature @xcite , namely : @xmath53 its galactocentric distance is @xmath54  kpc .",
    "we transform the positions and velocities into a galactocentric cartesian coordinate system and integrate a test particle back in time for @xmath50  gyr .",
    "this endpoint of the backward - integration is then the starting position of our initial model .",
    "even though the two potentials are quite similar in the innermost parts , the orbits differ in terms of perigalacticon , apogalacticon and number of disc crossings . in the db potential ,",
    "the galaxy is less massive in the outer parts , so the cluster can reach an apogalacticon of @xmath55  kpc , while in the ml case , it only reaches @xmath56  kpc .",
    "the perigalactica are @xmath57 and @xmath58  kpc , respectively . in fig .",

    "the middle curve ( green ) shows the result of the nbody  4 simulation neglecting stellar evolution and lowest curve ( blue ) shows the result of the nbody  4 run with stellar evolution .",

    "the ( green ) curve together with the right ordinate shows the evolution of the bound mass .",
    "it is visible in this figure that the mass - loss ceases after perigalacticon and turns into a steep mass - loss at the disc crossing .",
    "but as shown in the in - set ( vertical lines are the same as in the main figure ) the total mass - loss at this combination of perigalacticon and disc passage is @xmath58 times larger than the steep mass - loss caused by the actual disc passage . ]",
    "to simulate the evolution of the tails of ngc  5466 , we use the particle - mesh _ superbox _ package  @xcite .",
    "a particle - mesh code has the great advantage that we can use millions of particles ( which represent equal - mass phase - space elements rather than single stars ) and trace the faint tails very accurately .",
    "however , such a code is often not suitable for simulations of globular clusters , because it neglects the internal evolution due to two - body relaxation completely .",
    "the reason why _ superbox _ is nonetheless a valid method for the modelling of ngc  5466 is understood on examining the @xmath61 parameter @xcite : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 denotes the relaxation time - scale , which amounts to @xmath64  gyr for our initial model and to @xmath65  gyr for the present state of the globular cluster .",
    "additionally , @xmath66 denotes the disc shock time - scale , which is the time - scale on which the cluster is destroyed by disc shocks . using the formula from @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the period of the disc crossings , @xmath69 is the velocity with which the object crosses the disc , @xmath70 denotes the ratio of velocity dispersion to half - mass radius @xmath71 of the object and finally @xmath72 is the acceleration perpendicular to the disc . using our simulation data , we derive a disc shock time - scale of about @xmath73  gyr .",
    "this gives a @xmath74 , which holds for both galaxy models within the errors .",
    "the concentration @xmath75 of our initial model and the star cluster today is in the order of unity .",
    "if we now place our initial model in fig .",
    "13 of @xcite , we see that it falls in the regime where shocks are more important than internal evolution , but also in the regime where the star cluster survives for a hubble time . still , the location of our model is close to the border - line ( at @xmath76 it is @xmath77 ) where internal evolution becomes dominant .",
    "it is interesting to compare ngc  5466 with the well - studied case of pal  5 , which has @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "pal 5 will most likely be destroyed at its next disc crossing  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , ngc  5466 has a good chance of surviving even for the next hubble time !    to demonstrate that the internal evolution has no major effect , we perform two n - body simulations with @xmath80 particles in the ml potential using nbody4  @xcite and compare to the _ superbox _ results . in the first simulation , we use an equal mass for all particles and neglected stellar evolution . in the second simulation",
    ", we adopt a mass function which is present after the initial phase of violent mass - loss caused by the evolution of high mass stars ( first few tens of myr ) . in practice , this means another @xmath81  % has to be added to the initial mass to account for the mass - loss due to supernovae , and stellar winds , as well as the stars which become unbound due to this mass - loss . for the remaining stars , stellar evolution in nbody  4",
    "is switched on .",
    "figure  [ fig : nbody ] shows , by extrapolating the mass - loss in the direct n - body simulations linearly , that the additional mass - loss due to two - body relaxation and stellar evolution amounts at the very most to about one - third of the total mass - loss .",
    "the linear extrapolation of the mass - loss in this mass regime is justified by appeal to the work of @xcite . in other words , disregarding the initial mass - loss when the star cluster blows away its gaseous envelope ( which depends mainly on the star formation efficiency ) and the violent stellar evolution in the first few tens of myr , the dominant cause of mass - loss during the long - term evolution of ngc  5466 is the tidal field of the mw .",
    "having established that internal disruptive processes ( e.g. two - body relaxation ) are of minor importance , we also have to prove if disc shocks are the major external destruction process .",
    "we therefore performed a particle - mesh simulation with a halo - only potential .",
    "the mass - loss in this case amounts to @xmath82  % of the initial mass only ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] right panel ) .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath58 less than in the combined potential case .",
    "but this is not yet a genuine proof of the importance of disc shocks .",
    "as one can see in figs .",
    "[ fig : nbody ] and  [ fig : mass ] the mass - loss happens in short time - intervals like a step function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : perigal ] we blow up one of these short time intervals . the first ( black ) vertical line shows the time of perigalacticon while the second ( red ) line shows the time when the cluster crosses the disc ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "while the mass - loss due to the tidal field ceases after perigalacticon there is an additional steep mass - loss starting when the cluster passes the centre of the disc . but shown in the small in - set in fig .",
    "[ fig : perigal ] this mass - loss is about @xmath84 of the total mass - loss at the combined perigalacticon and disc passage .",
    "the general conclusion is therefore that it is definitely the tidal field of the disc ( the perigalacticon is well outside the bulge region ) which causes the major contribution of the mass - loss , the actual disc shock when the cluster passes through the centre of the disc may be not that important .",
    "this finding explains the rather large time - scale for disc shocks ( @xmath73  gyr ) of the previous section .",
    "one of the advantages of _ superbox _ is that it has high resolution sub - grids , which stay focused on the simulated objects and travel with them through the simulation area .",
    "this is important in studying the morphology of the tenuous and diffuse tidal tails . within the innermost grid",
    ", we resolve the globular cluster at a resolution of @xmath85 pc .",
    "the grid with medium resolution is chosen to resolve the tidal tails close to ngc  5466 with a resolution of @xmath86 pc .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ( first two panels ) , we plot the bound mass of our models in two galactic potentials ( db and ml ) . in both cases ,",
    "the mass - loss is strong in the first @xmath87@xmath82 gyr and then tends to level off during the later stages of the evolution .",
    "the mass - loss is mainly related to each disc crossing near perigalacticon and the mass stays almost constant during the rest of the orbit .",
    "this is the major reason why in the db potential the mass - loss over @xmath50  gyr of evolution is less than in the ml potential  the star cluster has had fewer disc crossings . in the ml potential",
    ", the cluster loses about @xmath88  % of its initial mass , whilst the cluster in the db potential only suffers a mass - loss of @xmath89  % ( with a fluctuation of only a few particles out of 1,000,000 ) .",
    "the mass - loss of the ml simulation is in very good agreement with the results found in previous studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , these mass - losses are only lower limits , as there will be a smaller , but not negligible , contribution from internal relaxation effects .            in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] , we show the data on the tails of ngc  5466 reproduced from @xcite , who used neural networks are used to reconstruct the probability density distribution . the contours correspond to level curves of equal neural network output and therefore trace the star density .",
    "the tails are clearly visible once the extragalactic contaminants ( predominantly galaxy clusters ) have been eliminated .",
    "the tails extend @xmath90 on the sky , corresponding to @xmath14 kpc in projected length .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]                         in the next two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] , we show the projection on the sky of our models in the ml and db potentials after @xmath50  gyr of evolution . both models show faint tidal tails , which match the general shape of the contours well .",
    "however , one important feature of the data is not reproduced ",
    "the leading and trailing tails are well - aligned with the proper motion vector .",
    "this contrasts with the data , in which the inner parts of the leading tails are slightly below the proper motion vector , whilst the inner parts of the trailing tails are slightly above .",
    "however , the observed proper motions are not well determined and have large error - bars ,",
    "so one possibility is that the proper motion of ngc  5466 should be either larger in right ascension or smaller in declination than the values given in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to match the observed misalignment .",
    "we confirm this result by running another simulation with slightly changed proper motions , namely @xmath91 this orbit gives a perigalacticon of @xmath92  kpc and an apogalacticon of @xmath93  kpc .",
    "although the change in proper motion does not make a significant difference to the mass - loss rate , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] , it does improve the match with the location of the observed tidal streams much better , including the misalignment . in the lower right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] , we see that the inner parts of the leading tails are now slightly below the old proper motion vector , whilst the inner parts of the trailing tails are now slightly above .",
    "[ fig : allsky ] shows all - sky views of the tidal tails , together with density profiles obtained by counting particles .",
    "the surface density of the tidal tails falls off along the innermost tails very steeply and stays at a very low density of @xmath81@xmath94  m@xmath16deg@xmath12 throughout the tails .",
    "these low densities are very hard to detect , even in surveys like sdss .",
    "@xcite found long , almost linear and very tenuous tidal extensions to ngc  5466 using a matched filter .",
    "although these extensions are hard to see in the sdss data , they do receive some support from the simulations presented here .",
    "the tails of our model with the revised proper motion extend over @xmath95 on the sky .",
    "@xcite claim that the average density of the tails is about @xmath50@xmath81 stars  deg@xmath12 , which is also in good agreement with out estimate .",
    "interestingly , at the point where @xcite start to loose track of the leading arm , our model is close to its apogalacticon and the tails are spread out much wider than is the case close to the cluster .",
    "although our simulation with the revised proper motion provides a good representation of the data , it is clearly not unique . in particular , it is interesting to understand the variety of tidal tail morphology for ngc  5466 , especially as forthcoming deeper photometry will provide stronger constraints on the modelling .",
    "accordingly , we perform a suite of _ superbox _ simulations to investigate how the choice of proper motion influences the mass - loss and hence the properties of the tidal tails . as a constraint ,",
    "we only used proper motions which are within the @xmath96 error range of the observed value  @xcite and also require that the orbital path near the cluster aligns with the tails found by @xcite , i.e. , have the same projected orbital path as our refined set of proper motion .",

    "[ fig : cont ] . for this simulation ,",
    "[ fig : internal ] shows the surface density and velocity dispersion profiles of the final cluster . adopting the data from @xcite ( updated values from 2003 ) , the cluster has a central surface brightness of @xmath11  magarcsec@xmath12 .",

    "note that , observationally speaking , @xmath104 is determined by fitting a king ( 1966 ) profile to the surface brightness distribution , which does not correspond exactly to the theoretical definition .",
    "according to our simulations , the tidal radius at the last perigalacticon was about @xmath105  pc .",
    "while the surface density in the inner parts is not much affected by the mass - loss , the central velocity dispersion is reduced by approximately @xmath50  % . also visible",
    "is a rise in the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the outer parts , which starts already within the actual tidal radius .",
    "this is due to the fact that all line - of - sight measurements are contaminated by unbound stars streaming in front or behind the star cluster . while they do not affect the central values because of their low number , their effect is easily measurable in the outer parts where the densities of the bound stars are much lower",
    "we have presented numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of the tidal tails of the globular cluster ngc  5466 .",
    "we used direct n - body codes to argue that the evolution of the cluster is dominated by external effects rather than internal relaxation , and then grid - based codes to trace the faint tidal tails .",
    "this novel , hybrid approach is well - suited to map out the detailed morphology of the low - density tails of ngc  5466 .",
    "naively , we might expect that a low mass cluster with observed and very lengthy tails on a disc crossing orbit would not be able to survive for too much longer .",
    "however , simulations by @xcite have already shown that the disrupting globular cluster pal  5 has survived for at least many gyr in a tidally - dominated and out - of - equilibrium state , although pal 5 probably will be destroyed at the next disc crossing . here",
    ", we have demonstrated that a progenitor cluster of ngc  5466 , which is quite similar to the present cluster , could survive substantially longer , for at least a few hubble times , with its extensive but tenuous tidal tails gradually wrapping around the whole galaxy .",
    "the evolution of ngc  5466 is mainly driven by tidal shocks at each perigalacticon / disc crossing combination .",
    "although not entirely negligible , internal effects ( two - body relaxation and evaporation of stars driven by post - core collapsed processes @xcite ) play a much less important role in the mass - loss .",
    "it is this property which allows us to study the tidal tails using grid - based codes rather than the more cumbersome direct n - body codes .",
    "if the observationally determined mass - to - light ratio of @xmath14 is correct , then the initial mass of ngc  5466 is @xmath106  m@xmath16 . by initial mass , we do not mean the embedded mass of the star cluster at its formation inside a gas - cloud .",
    "if the star formation efficiency is low , a star cluster can lose about @xmath107  per cent of its initial mass in stars when the gas gets blown out by high velocity winds or supernovae explosions .",
    "the rapid stellar evolution of high mass stars then adds another extreme mass - loss of @xmath108  per cent in the first few tens of myr . after this initial phase of rapid evolution , the cluster reaches a quasi - equilibrium .",
    "this is the starting point of our simulations and therefore our initial mass refers to this point in time .",
    "our numerical simulations reproduce the observational results of both groups who have recently studied the tidal tails ngc  5466 with sdss data .",
    "mapping out the tails close to the globular cluster , @xcite found that the leading tail emerges from the side pointing towards the galactic centre and returns to the orbital path from outside , while the trailing tail emerges from the side opposite to the galactic centre and returns to the orbital path from within . with our simulations , we showed that the proper motion of the globular cluster has to be smaller in declination and/or larger in right ascension than reported by  @xcite to account for the position of the tidal tails .",
    "we propose a new set of proper motions , @xmath109 for which the tail morphology is correctly reproduced .",
    "this differs from the observationally determined one by @xmath110 and @xmath111  masyr@xmath24 respectively .",
    "these changes are within the error margins of the observed proper motion ( @xmath112  masyr@xmath24 ) .",
    "the surface density of the tidal tails falls off along the innermost tails very steeply and stays at a very low density of @xmath81@xmath94  m@xmath16deg@xmath12 throughout the tails .",
    "these low densities are very hard to detect , even in surveys like sdss .",
    "@xcite found long , almost linear and very tenuous tidal extensions to ngc  5466 using a matched filter approach .",
    "their work is supported by the simulations in this paper , which show that the very long ( @xmath113 ) , faint tidal tails are expected .",
    "the tails in our simulation have roughly the same surface density as found by @xcite .    in the future , deeper photometry , radial velocities and  thanks to the gaia and sim satellites  proper motions of individual stars in the tidal tails may become available . mapping out the structure of the tails of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies will then provide powerful constraints on the galactic potential .",
    "this work , together with the observational papers of @xcite and @xcite , has shown that ngc  5466 is a prime target for such studies of cold streams .",
