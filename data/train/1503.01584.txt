    "in electroencephalography ( eeg ) electrical currents are recorded at different positions on the scalp to measure the brain activity .",

    "for example , the correlations are much stronger than in normal periods  @xcite . this time dependence of the correlations is the kind of non  stationarity that we wish to address .",
    "non  stationarities are also seen when wave packets travel through disordered systems . even if the disorder is static , the correlations between the wave intensities measured at different positions versus time will change , when the direction or the composition of the wave packet is altered  @xcite .",

    "its hamiltonian is viewed as a random matrix , whose dimension is eventually sent to infinity .",
    "ergodicity holds in this limit , meaning that a smoothing energy average of an observable over one individual spectrum equals the average over an ensemble of random matrices . a noticeable exception",
    "are random matrix applications to quantum chromodynamics  @xcite . in lattice gauge theory , the quarks first propagate in frozen configurations of the gauge fields , before an average over the gauge fields , modeled by random matrices , is carried out as second step .",
    "this clearly belongs in class 2 .",
    "the fluctuating gauge fields truly exist , the partition function involves an integral over them .",

    "[ sec2 ] a statistically significant way to construct a proper and analytically tractable random matrix ensemble from the data .",
    "we emphasize that this is an important issue for random matrix models in the context of correlations .",
    "in contrast to quantum chaos , where universality holds on the scale of the mean level spacing , there is not such a local scale when studying statistical properties of correlation matrices .",
    "thus , a gaussian assumption is not always justified and it does matter what the ensemble looks like in reality . in particular , realistic ensembles considerably help to understand and model large events .",

    "the log  logistic distribution @xmath104 with @xmath105 yields a very good description of the data , even slightly better than the beta prime distribution .",
    "the @xmath106 values are around one , @xmath107 for @xmath71 trading day and increasing for larger @xmath69",
    ". however , the resulting ensemble deformation function can take positive and negative values .",
    "for example , for @xmath107 , we find @xmath108 hence , it can not be interpreted as a distribution . indeed",
    ", we are confronted with a problem of interpretation . while the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec23 ] clearly revealed that @xmath58 is a well  defined distribution of a random variable , namely of a variance , it is not obvious that @xmath31 also represents a well  defined distribution .",
    "the corresponding random variables , the matrices @xmath22 , do not have a direct data interpretation .",
    "thus , one might simply view @xmath31 as a continuous coefficient function for the expansion of the distribution  ( [ defwis ] ) in terms of gaussians",
    ". nevertheless , even if one does not want to enforce an interpretation of @xmath31 as a distribution , the resulting ensemble distribution  ( [ defwis ] ) must be positive definite .",
    "we test this by calculating the distribution of the traces @xmath109 \\ . \\label{tracesig}\\ ] ] as we only wish to test the positivity , it is convenient to choose it different from the above distribution  ( [ trace ] ) by including the covariance matrix . after some algebra",
    ", we can express it as a high  order derivative involving the return distribution deformation function , @xmath110 this in principle general result gives for the log  logistic distribution  ( [ logp ] ) @xmath111 restricting ourselves to even @xmath24 , we may employ the theory of complex functions to calculate the pole expansion @xmath112 with the poles @xmath113 the derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) can now easily be evaluated and we arrive at @xmath114 inspite of the complex poles , this is by construction a real function . yet , it takes positive and negative values which outrules an interpretation of @xmath115 and thus also of @xmath116 as distributions . by means of this example we face the somewhat surprising result that a well  defined distribution @xmath58 does not necessarily yield a well  defined ensemble .",
    "each case has to be investigated individually .",
    "we argued in sec .",
    "[ sec21 ] that the gaussian assumption  ( [ gaussian ] ) for the static amplitude distribution is not as restrictive as it might appear at first sight .",
    "nevertheless , we now extend our construction by assuming more general functional forms . at present",
    ", we do not have data at our disposal in which the static amplitude distribution is non  gaussian , but we nevertheless now extend our construction , as it might be useful for future data analyses .",
    "moreover , we will also come across some interesting observations . instead of eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) , we now assume that the static amplitude distribution can be expressed as an average over the gaussian  ( [ gaussian ] ) , @xmath117 with a new deformation function @xmath118 that fulfils @xmath119 we proceed as in sec .",
    "[ sec22 ] . instead of the ensemble average  ( [ average ] ) , we now have @xmath120 \\overline{w}(a|\\sigma , n )                       \\overline{g}\\left(r\\left|\\frac{1}{n}aa^\\dagger\\right.\\right ) \\ . \\label{averageg}\\ ] ] this is readily cast into the form @xmath121 which differs from eq .",
    "( [ averagesingle ] ) only by the definition of the amplitude distribution deformation function .",
    "it is now given by @xmath122 for fixed @xmath123 , we introduce the new variable @xmath124 and find @xmath125 which coincides with eq .",
    "( [ aampldef ] ) , but now involving the new ensemble deformation function @xmath126 this integral is reminiscent of a convolution .",
    "thus , the case of a deformed , non  gaussian static amplitude distribution is formally traced back to the gaussian case .",
    "the difference can be fully absorbed into the ensemble deformation function .",
    "importantly , this means that all other results of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] continue to hold , in particular the laplace transform  ( [ laplace ] ) and its inversion  ( [ invlaplace ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the following problem remains .",
    "we can extract @xmath118 and @xmath58 from the data by using the methods outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec23 ] for very short time intervals and for the whole , long time interval , respectively . from the inverse laplace",
    "transform  ( [ invlaplace ] ) , we obtain @xmath127 , but to determine @xmath31 , we are left with the task to invert eq .",
    "( [ aampldefg3 ] ) .",
    "although that is definitely possible for some special cases , a general inversion formula is lacking . in practical applications , however , the extension sketched above is more likely to be needed for consistency tests .",
    "for example , if some of the available data for the same system permit the gaussian assumption for the static amplitude distribution and others do not , one can first determine @xmath31 as described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] and then turn to the data which require an additional deformation function @xmath118 . once both of these deformation functions are known , one can evaluate @xmath127 and check if it is consistent with the inverse  ( [ invlaplace ] ) of @xmath58 which is independently extracted from the data .",
    "as an example , we consider the case that both , @xmath31 and @xmath118 , are @xmath34 distributions @xmath128 of @xmath82 and @xmath129 degrees of freedom , respectively . the choice for @xmath31 coincides with the result of sec .  [ sec32 ] . with eq",
    "( [ aampldefg3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order @xmath132 .",
    "this function already appeared in the ensemble averaged return distribution of ref .",
    "@xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ aampldefg2 ] ) , the distribution @xmath58 is an integral involving the modified bessel function and the return distribution averaged over the deformed ensemble is an integral over a product of modified bessel functions , but we do not give the formulae here .",
    "non  stationarity is an often encountered feature in complex systems . here , we addressed non  stationarity of correlations .",
    "we presented a method to determine their distribution from the amplitude distribution .",
    "put differently , we showed how to extract the proper ensemble of random covariance matrices from amplitude data . carrying out our analysis for the case of financial data",
    ", we found an algebraic distribution of covariance matrices reflecting the heavy tails in the amplitude , _",
    "i.e. _ , return distributions .",
    "a conceptually important comment is in order .",
    "consider any two empirical covariance matrices @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "they are certainly not independent , because , first , the correlation structure due to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the industrial sectors in the financial markets only changes on a large time scale and , second , one would expect that they are the more dependent the smaller the time difference @xmath135 .",
    "the first cause is a built  in feature of our model , as the random model covariance matrices fluctuate around the empirical @xmath29 .",
    "the second cause is effectively accounted for as the length of our model time series @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the second dimension of the random matrices @xmath22 , is different from the length @xmath4 of the subintervals in which the empirical covariance matrices @xmath13 are evaluated .",
    "the values for @xmath24 resulting from the data analysis are very small @xmath136 while @xmath137 when measuring @xmath13 .",
    "our random matrix ansatz does not aim at modeling the ensemble of the empirical covariance matrices @xmath13 in a one  to  one fashion .",
    "this is never the goal of a statistical approach .",
    "our model has an effective character which is obvious , for example , in the relation @xmath138 .",
    "model time series much shorter than the empirical ones suffice to properly grasp the statistical effects induced by the fluctuations around the average covariance matrix .",
    "this also reflects the mutual dependence of the empirical covariance matrices .",
    "we demonstrated by our analysis of financial data how useful our model is .",
    "furthermore , observables such as the amplitude distribution do not resolve autocorrelations in time of any kind . even reshuffeling",
    "the order of the empirical covariance matrices @xmath13 in time does not change the amplitude distribution for the total time interval .",
    "a similar situation is encountered when analyzing statistical properties of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the gauge fields may be viewed as a really existing ensemble over which an average is carried out  this is the very definition of the partition function .",
    "although these gauge fields are not independent either , an effect of this autocorrelation is only seen if corresponding observables are used .",
    "densities are not affected .",
    "random matrices as models for the highly non  trivial gauge fields are applied with great success .",
    "yet another aspect is worth mentioning .",
    "in contrast to random matrix applications for hamiltonian systems , there is not a local scale that can enforce universal statistical behavior .",
    "thus , it is important how the covariances are actually distributed .",
    "gaussian assumptions are only acceptable if really justified by data analysis .",
    "the present study extends a previous one in which we employed such a gaussian assumption in finance . here",
    ", we reconsidered the same data set and clearly demonstrated that the gaussian assumption underestimates the tails .",
    "the algebraic distributions that we found here are relevant for risk estimation as they help to better understand large events .",
    "importantly , once the ensemble is properly extracted , meaningful averages can be computed for all observables that depend on non  stationary covariances .",
    "when developing our construction , we came across a puzzling feature which calls for a caveat .",
    "the deformation function extracted from the amplitude distribution determines , on the one hand , uniquely the ensemble , but , on the other hand , this ensemble is not necessarily well  defined .",
    "each case has to be studied individually .",
    "we do not expect this to cause severe problems in applications , but conceptually it is an interesting aspect .",
    "we also extended our construction by including deformed static amplitude distributions . the additional freedom accompanying",
    "this extension might offer a possibility to circumvent the above mentioned puzzling problem . from a more general viewpoint",
    ", we have to emphasize that our construction only includes functional forms of the ensemble that depend on the trace over the product of the random covariance matrix and the mean covariance matrix .",
    "although this is quite natural , as it guarantees a certain amount of basis invariance which all random matrix models need , more general functional forms pose an interesting and potentially important challenge .",
    "hitherto , we only applied our method to finance .",
    "we plan applications to other complex systems , too .",
    "this may be rewarding , as large events and risk estimations are not only important in finance .",
