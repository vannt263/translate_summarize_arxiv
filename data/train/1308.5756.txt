    "the riemann hypothesis is considered to be one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics , and a central issue in analytic number theory ( titchmarsh and heath - brown , 1987 ) , as , if proved , it would give more precise estimates for the distribution of zeros of the riemann zeta function @xmath5of the complex argument @xmath6 , and in turn more precise information about the distribution of prime numbers . the hypothesis itself",
    "is that all zeros of @xmath5 have @xmath7 , and its proof has resisted the efforts of many famous mathematicians .",
    "however , their efforts have resulted in an impressive and extensive literature , dealing with many properties of @xmath5 and closely related functions .    among many results concerning the riemann hypothesis which have been proved ,",
    "we cite the property that all zeros of @xmath5 lie in the critical strip @xmath8 , and that the number of zeros lying on the critical line is infinite ( titchmarsh and heath - brown , 1987 ) .",
    "the bohr - landau theorem ( edwards , 1974 ) proves that all but an infinitesimal fraction of zeros of @xmath5 lie arbitrarily close to the critical line .",
    "this important result however does not constrain the proportion of zeros actually lying on the critical line .",
    "work on constraining this fraction has continued , with the results improving from 1/3 ( levinson , 1974 ) to 2/5 ( conrey , 1989 ) and latterly to 41% ( bui , conrey and young , 2011 ) .",
    "there of course have been numerical investigations as to the truth of the riemann hypothesis for finite ranges of @xmath9 ( see for example chapter 15 in titchmarsh and heath - brown , 1987 ) , with it being established that the first @xmath10 zeros of @xmath5 are simple and lie on the critical line .",
    "( the fact that all zeros of @xmath5 are simple is an important property of @xmath11 yet to be proved . )",
    "such a famous conjecture as the riemann hypothesis has attracted the attention of physicists , and indeed is of importance to them , since the zeta function occurs in regularisation arguments in quantum field theories ( elizalde , 1995 ) .",
    "an excellent review of the links between physics and the riemann hypothesis has been given by schumayer and hutchinson ( 2011 ) .",
    "the connections they mention are in classical mechanics , quantum mechanics , nuclear physics , condensed matter physics , and statistical physics .",
    "the path the present authors and their colleagues followed leading to investigations into the hypothesis commenced with a paper by lord rayleigh ( 1892 ) , which has been applied in studies of photothermal solar absorbers ( mcphedran & mckenzie , 1978 , perrins , mckenzie & mcphedran , 1979 ) , photonic crystals and metamaterials ( nicorovici , mcphedran & botten , 1995 ) .",
    "its underlying mathematics involved the properties of conditionally - convergent double sums , and the class of such sums used by rayleigh has interesting connections with the riemann hypothesis .    to be more specific ,",
    "in a recent paper ( mcphedran et al 2011 , hereafter referred to as i ) it was established that the riemann hypothesis held for all of a particular class of two - dimensional sums over the square lattice if and only if it held for the lowest member of that class .",
    "that lowest member , denoted @xmath12 was known from the work of lorenz ( 1871 ) and hardy ( 1920 ) to be given by the product of the riemann zeta function @xmath5 , and a particular dirichlet @xmath13 function , @xmath14 . in i",
    "it was also established that , if all zeros of @xmath12 lie on @xmath7 by a generalisation of the riemann hypothesis , then the whole class of sums has the same distribution function for zeros , as far as all terms tending to infinity with @xmath15 are concerned .    here",
    "we wish to link these results to an established result for a combination of riemann zeta functions given by p.r .",
    "taylor , and published in a posthumous paper in 1945 ( taylor , 1945 ) .",
    "an editor s note to this paper refers to flight lieutenant p.r .",
    "taylor as `` missing , believed killed , on active service in november 1943 '' .",
    "it also notes that professor titchmarsh revised and completed taylor s argument .",
    "what taylor proved _ inter alia _ was that @xmath16 has all its zeros on @xmath7 , where @xmath17 is a symmetrised form of @xmath11 .",
    "after this proposition was stated , it was commented that it``may be a step towards the proof of the riemann hypothesis '' .",
    "we will take this comment further here , in order to establish that taylor s work does indeed furnish an only partially - explored way of investigating the riemann hypothesis , together with related questions .",
    "google scholar lists ten citations of taylor s paper .",
    "of the seven relevant to our concerns here , two ( anderson , 1986 and matsumoto & tanigawa ) use taylor s method of proof .",
    "the other five have been published in the interval 2006 - 2010 , testifying to recent interest in the properties of functions closely associated with the riemann zeta function .",
    "the survey article of balazard ( 2010 ) refers to taylor s paper as a `` remarkable contribution to the theory of the @xmath18 function '' , and to his proof as `` classical and elegant '' .",
    "it is also commented that velasquez castaon ( 2010 ) extended taylor s method into a very general context , and showed that numerous recent results flowed naturally from the approach .",
    "the combination of zeta functions considered by taylor is antisymmetric under the replacement @xmath19 . here ,",
    "we will complement taylor s function by a symmetric combination , and replace the variable @xmath20 by @xmath21 , in order to provide a link with the two - dimensional sums studied in i. the resulting functions will be denoted @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . we will give numerical evidence ( and later prove ) that @xmath0 and @xmath1 both have the same distribution functions of zeros on the critical line @xmath7 , and that this is also the same as that of @xmath12 and @xmath22 .",
    "we give in section 2 the definitions of relevant functions , which are @xmath1 , @xmath0 , their ratio @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath12 , and provide numerical evidence concerning their distributions of zeros on the critical line .",
    "the numerical evidence shown motivated the proofs given in sections 3 and 4 , but of course does not in itself constitute an essential element of those proofs .",
    "we discuss in section 3 the morphologies of relevant functions in the regions around their zeros and poles .",
    "this provides the basis for the proofs in section 4 that @xmath1 , in addition to @xmath0 as proved by taylor ( 1945 ) , has all its zeros on the critical line , and that all zeros of both functions are simple . in section 4 , we also make explicit the links between the zeros and the distribution functions of zeros of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and those of the riemann zeta function @xmath2 .",
    "these links in fact enable us to put forward a proof that all the zeros of @xmath2 have a number distribution function that must agree with those for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in all terms which diverge as @xmath4 .",
    "an important feature of section 4 is that the proofs advanced of the mathematical propositions are based on a property of an equivalent electrostatic problem which would be regarded as self - evident by many physicists .",
    "we include two appendices , the first of which discusses the convergence of the logarithmic potential function associated with @xmath25 .",
    "the second illustrates modified functions @xmath25 which do not obey the riemann hypothesis , but from which may be constructed a function @xmath23 having all the properties listed above ( all zeros and poles on the critical line , all these being of first order , no zeros of derivatives on the critical line ) .",
    "the proofs in this paper are less formal than is expected for important results in analytic number theory ( while being of similar style to that of speiser,1934 ) , but may have the desirable outcome of motivating the construction of more formal proofs . at all events ,",
    "their construction is such as to make them accessible and interesting to mathematical physicists and applied mathematicians .",
    "they also establish that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are two functions which provably have the properties which one would desire to be able to prove for @xmath11 .",
    "it may be the case that the comparative method used in i , or a related method , may be used to forge a link between them and @xmath26 , enabling the resolution of the riemann hypothesis .",
    "after the initial version of this article was completed , the authors became aware of an important earlier paper by lagarias and suzuki ( 2006 ) .",
    "there is significant overlap between the 2006 paper and the content of section 4 : the 2006 paper contains rigorous proofs of propositions for which more physically - based arguments are given here .",
    "lagarias and suzuki also give more general forms for combinations of the symmetrized zeta functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 which obey the riemann hypothesis than those discussed in section 4 .",
    "we recall the definition from mcphedran et al ( 2011 ) of two sets of angular lattice sums for the square array : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , the prime denotes the exclusion of the point at the origin , and the complex number @xmath20 is written in terms of real and imaginary parts as @xmath6 .",
    "the sum independent of the angle @xmath31 was evaluated by lorenz ( 1871 ) and hardy(1920 ) in terms of the product of dirichlet @xmath13 functions : @xmath32 a useful account of the properties of dirichlet @xmath13 functions such as @xmath14 has been given by zucker & robertson ( 1976 ) .",
    "an expression for the lowest order sum was derived by kober ( 1936 ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the modified bessel function of the second kind , or macdonald function , with order @xmath35 and argument @xmath36 .",
    "let us introduce a general notation for macdonald function sums : @xmath37 by interchanging @xmath38 and @xmath39 and using the relation @xmath40 , we see that @xmath41 is symmetric under the substitution @xmath19 : @xmath42    the lowest symmetric sum is , if @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",

    "they are therefore real on the critical line @xmath7 .",

    "taylor proved in fact that his function obeys the riemann hypothesis , as must then @xmath0 .",
    "now , from titchmarsh & heath - brown ( 1987 ) , the riemann zeta function has its zeros confined to the region @xmath49 , from which we immediately see that @xmath1 and @xmath0 can not have coincident zeros .",

    "as we have remarked , p. r. taylor ( 1945 ) proved that @xmath0 obeyed the riemann hypothesis , and we have seen the connection between @xmath12 and @xmath1 in equation ( [ n25a ] ) above .",
