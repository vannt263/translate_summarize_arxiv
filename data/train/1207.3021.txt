    "the trapping laser fields are on during the entire experimental sequence and the counter - propagating far red - detuned fields are set to a mutual detuning @xmath21 .    due to the double - pass configuration of the aoms , we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the frequencies of the rf signals applied to the aoms ( see fig .

    "[ fig : atomsandpos]*a * , the shift of the com is plotted versus the detuning of the two counter - propagating trapping fields .",

    "for each group , we compute the sum of the pixel brightness values , @xmath42 , as well as the error of this sum , @xmath43 .",
    "the latter is estimated by computing the standard deviation of the @xmath44 values in each group @xmath41 and by multiplying it with @xmath45 .",
    "the com position is computed by the weighted sum of the bin positions according to @xmath46 .",
    "the error of each com position is calculated by applying gaussian error propagation to this formula using the @xmath43 values . in order to check the validity of this approach we verified that the size of the errors is largely independent of the bin size for @xmath47 .",
    "both , @xmath48 and its error , are converted into real - space quantities using a calibration obtained in an independent measurement .    for absolute detunings @xmath49{khz}$ ] , the com shifts linearly with the detuning , indicating that the ensemble is transported in the conveyor belt for a fixed duration .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) , the duration @xmath50 of the transport can be obtained by fitting @xmath51 to the data in the range from @xmath52  khz to @xmath53  khz in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomsandpos]*a * yielding @xmath541  ms .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the atoms are loaded into the nanofiber - based trap approximately 77  ms after the start of the loading sequence .",
    "the data for @xmath55{khz}$ ] deviate from the linear behavior .",
    "moreover , the number of detected atoms after the transport also decreases in this detuning range , see fig .  [",
    "fig : atomsandpos]*b*. this effect can be qualitatively understood by considering that the atoms are cooled by the molasses in the laboratory frame while the optical conveyor belt moves at a constant velocity with respect to the latter .",
    "if we assume that atoms which move in the same direction and with the same velocity as the moving conveyor belt are loaded most efficiently into the trapping sites , one would therefore expect the loading efficiency to be proportional to the fraction of molasses atoms with velocity @xmath29 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) .",
    "this fraction is given by a one - dimensional maxwell - boltzmann distribution , i.e. , a gaussian as a function of @xmath29 with 1/@xmath56-halfwidth of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the temperature of the molasses - cooled cloud of atoms and @xmath59 is the mass of a cesium atom .",
    "consequently , one expects the transfer efficiency to drop if @xmath60 exceeds @xmath61 or , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) , if the detuning @xmath36 exceeds @xmath62 where @xmath58 is in @xmath63k . in a separate measurement",
    "we record the expansion of our molasses - cooled cloud with a ccd as a function of expansion time and derive a temperature of @xmath64k .",
    "inserting this temperature into eq .",
    "( [ eq : width_of_transfer ] ) yields a detuning range of @xmath65  khz over which the transfer efficiency is significant .",
    "this range is in reasonable agreement with the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomsandpos]*b*.    in comparison to the experiments presented in @xcite , the storage time of the atoms in the trap was significantly shorter here ( @xmath66  ms vs.  @xmath67  ms ) .",
    "we attribute this reduced lifetime to an increased relative phase noise of the two counter - propagating lattice laser fields which leads to a position fluctuation of the lattice along the nanofiber , resulting in resonant heating of the atoms .",
    "the increase in phase noise is caused by the inclusion of the two aoms into the beam path of the red - detuned trapping fields , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]*a * , which are driven by two rf sources ( agilent mxg n5182a & agilent n9310a , where the first provided the 10  mhz external clock reference for the second ) .",
    "we measure the one - sided power spectrum @xmath68 of relative phase fluctuations between the two rf signals  @xcite and obtain @xmath69rad@xmath70/hz at the axial oscillation frequency of the trap @xmath71  khz .",
    "both red - detuned trapping fields pass through aoms in double - pass configuration .",
    "consequently , the relative phase noise of the rf signals powering the aoms will be imparted on the red - detuned trapping fields , resulting in relative phase fluctuations between the two optical fields with a one - sided power spectrum of @xmath72 the axial position of the standing wave pattern formed by the two red - detuned counter - propagating trapping fields will fluctuate in the presence of relative phase fluctuations of the optical signals .",
    "the corresponding one - sided power spectrum @xmath73 of the axial position fluctuations of the standing wave is given by @xmath74 according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the resonant heating rate for atoms in a trap due to position fluctuations of the trap minimum can be calculated according to @xmath75 yielding @xmath76{mk / s}$ ] for our experimental values . in the absence of other heating mechanisms , this heating rate would lead to a trap lifetime of @xmath77{ms}$ ] , where @xmath78k is the initial temperature of the atoms in the nanofiber trap @xcite .",
    "taking into account the trap lifetime without aoms of @xmath79  ms , the theoretically expected trap lifetime in the conveyor belt is thus given by @xmath80 in reasonable agreement with our observation .",
    "using a low phase noise dual - frequency rf source to drive the aoms , it should be possible to overcome the current phase noise limitation of the trap lifetime .    in principle",
    ", it should become possible to transport atoms over significant distances .",
    "for this purpose , one would load the atoms into a stationary standing wave which is subsequently accelerated . in the frame moving with the lattice",
    ", such an acceleration leads to a tilt of the potential . assuming that the atoms are initially at a temperature much lower than the trap depth , a maximum acceleration of @xmath81{m / s^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be applied before the trapping minima vanish  @xcite . assuming this maximum acceleration , the maximum distance over which the atoms can be transported is given by @xmath82 , where the transportation time @xmath83 is in ms .",
    "however , it should be noted that a limitation of @xmath83 might arise due to possible axial variations of the trapping potential due to imperfections of the nanofiber ( inhomogeneous diameter , surface roughness , bulk scatters etc . ) . by transporting the atoms along the nanofiber",
    ", such variations would translate into temporal fluctuations of the trapping potential which could then lead to a velocity - dependent heating of the atoms in the conveyor belt .",
    "moreover , for long accelerations , the required detuning between the rf drive frequencies might eventually exceed the bandwidth of the aoms . and",
    "finally , the losses of the nanofiber section have to be small enough to guarantee a high contrast of the standing wave spatial intensity modulation over the entire length of the nanofiber . with our fiber pulling rig described in @xcite , nanofibers with a waist length of up to @xmath84{cm}$ ] and a transmission of 98.9% , measured with the method described in @xcite and compatible with the above requirement ,",
    "have already been manufactured successfully .",
    "we demonstrated optical transport of cesium atoms over millimeter - scale distances using a nanofiber - based optical conveyor belt . in combination with the strong confinement of both the atoms and the trapping light fields , this technique might be used as a tool for coupling laser - cooled atoms in a deterministic way to functional devices like , e.g. , whispering - gallery - mode resonators  @xcite and solid state quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "the transported atoms might also be used as a scanning probe for external fields similar to what has been realized with nv diamond nanocrystals @xcite . moreover",
    ", the transport should enable a sequential loading procedure of the nanofiber - based trap .",
    "in this way , larger ensembles of fiber - coupled atoms with optical densities on the order of a few hundred could be trapped . by sequentially loading two ensembles at a given distance with respect to each other along the nanofiber ,",
    "this would also allow one to realize the recently proposed optical nanofiber - resonator with atomic mirrors @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that due to very strong localization of the atoms in the nanofiber trap , the conveyor belt could be used to create a flux of cold atoms with very high brightness .",
    "this might facilitate nanofiber - based atom lithography as well as cold collision experiments with a high degree of control over the collision parameters .",
