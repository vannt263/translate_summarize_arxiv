    "this construction was introduced by frucht and harary @xcite with the ( achieved ) goal of constructing a graph whose automorphism group is the wreath product of the two component automorphism groups .",
    "since then , a variety of papers have appeared investigating a wide range of graph - theoretic properties of coronas , such as the bandwidth @xcite , the minimum sum @xcite , applications to ramsey theory @xcite , etc .",
    "further , the spectral properties of coronas are significant in the study of invertible graphs .",
    "briefly , a graph @xmath1 is invertible if the inverse of the graph s adjacency matrix is diagonally similar to the adjacency matrix of another graph @xmath9 .",
    "motivated by applications to quantum chemistry , godsil @xcite studies invertible bipartite graphs with a unique perfect matching . in response to his question asking for a characterization of such graphs with the additional property that @xmath10 , simian and cao @xcite determine the answer to be exactly the coronas of bipartite graphs with the single - vertex graph @xmath11 .",
    "the study of spectral properties of coronas was continued by barik , et .",
    "al . in @xcite , who found the spectrum of the corona @xmath12 in the special case that @xmath2 is regular . in section 2",
    ", we drop the regularity condition on @xmath2 and compute the spectrum of the corona of any pair of graphs using a new graph invariant called the coronal . in section 3",
    ", we compute the coronal for several families of graphs , including regular graphs examined in @xcite , complete @xmath3-partite graphs , and path graphs .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we see that properties of the spectrum of coronas lends itself to finding many large families of cospectral graph pairs .",

    "the characteristic polynomial of @xmath1 is @xmath21 .",
    "we use the standard notations @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 respectively for the path , cycle , star , and complete graphs on @xmath3 vertices .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be finite simple graphs on @xmath5 and @xmath3 vertices , respectively , and let @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote their respective adjacency matrices .",
    "we begin by choosing a convenient labeling of the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "recall that @xmath0 is comprised of the @xmath5 vertices of @xmath1 , which we label arbitrarily using the symbols @xmath26 , and @xmath5 copies @xmath27 of @xmath2 .",
    "choose an arbitrary ordering @xmath28 of the vertices of @xmath2 , and label the vertex in @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath29 by the label @xmath30 .",

    "we introduce one new invariant for this purpose .",
    "let @xmath2 be a graph on @xmath3 vertices , with adjacency matrix @xmath19 .",
    "note that , viewed as a matrix over the field of rational functions @xmath32 , the characteristic matrix @xmath33 has determinant @xmath34 , so is invertible .",
    "the _ coronal _",
    "@xmath35 of @xmath2 is defined to be the sum of the entries of the matrix @xmath36 .",
    "note this can be calculated as @xmath37    our main theorem is that , beyond the spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , only the coronal of @xmath2 is needed to compute the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "[ bigthm ] let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be graphs with @xmath5 and @xmath3 vertices .",
    "let @xmath38 be the coronal of @xmath2 .",
    "then the characteristic polynomial of @xmath0 is @xmath39 in particular , the spectrum of @xmath0 is completely determined by the characteristic polynomials @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the coronal @xmath42 of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the respective adjacency matrices of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we compute the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath43 .",
    "for this , we recall two elementary results from linear algebra on the multiplication of kronecker products and determinants of block matrices :    * in cases where each multiplication makes sense , we have @xmath44 * if @xmath45 is invertible , then @xmath46    combining these two facts , we have ( as an equality of rational functions ) @xmath47\\\\ & = \\det(\\lambda i_n - b)^m\\det(\\lambda i_m - a-({\\bf 1}_n^t(\\lambda i_n - b)^{-1}{\\bf 1}_n)\\otimes i_m)\\\\ & = \\det(\\lambda i_n - b)^m\\det((\\lambda-\\chi_h(\\lambda))i_m - a)\\\\ & = f_h(\\lambda)^mf_g(\\lambda-\\chi_h(\\lambda)).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ cospec ] a natural question is whether or not the spectrum of @xmath0 is determined by the spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , whether knowledge of the coronal is strictly necessary .",
    "indeed it is : computing the coronals of the cospectral graphs @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 thus cospectral graphs need not have the same coronal , and hence for a given graph @xmath1 , the spectra of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are almost always distinct .",
    "note that this stands in stark contrast to the situation for the cartesian and tensor products of graphs . in both of these cases ,",
    "the spectrum of the product is determined by the spectra of the components .",
    "the unexpected simplicity of the examples in the above remark are representative of a fairly common phenomena : since the coronal @xmath53 can be computed as the quotient of the sum @xmath54 of the cofactors of @xmath33 by the characteristic polynomial @xmath55 , it is _ a priori _ the quotient of a degree @xmath56 polynomial by a degree @xmath3 polynomial . in practice , however , as in the examples in the remark , these two polynomials typically have roots in common , providing for a reduced expression for the coronal . let us suppose that @xmath57 has degree @xmath58 ( the @xmath59 being taken in @xmath60 $ ] ) , so that @xmath38 in its reduced form is a quotient of a degree @xmath61 polynomial by a degree @xmath62 polynomial . since the denominator of this reduced fraction is a factor of @xmath55 , and since @xmath40 is of degree @xmath5 , each pole of @xmath38 is simultaneously a multiplicity-@xmath5 pole of @xmath63 and a multiplicity-@xmath5 root of @xmath64 . since these contributions cancel in the overall determination of the roots of @xmath65 in the expression    @xmath66    from theorem [ bigthm ] , we can now more explicitly describe the spectrum of the corona .",
    "namely , let @xmath62 be the degree of the denominator of @xmath38 as a reduced fraction .",
    "then the spectrum of @xmath0 consists of :    * some `` old '' eigenvalues , i.e. , the roots of @xmath55 which are not poles of @xmath38 ( or equivalently , the roots of @xmath67 ) , each with multiplicity @xmath68 ; and * some `` new '' eigenvalues , i.e. , the values @xmath69 such that @xmath70 is an eigenvalue @xmath71 of @xmath1 ( with the multiplicity of @xmath69 equal to the multiplicity of @xmath71 as an eigenvalue of @xmath1 . )    since for a given @xmath71 , solving @xmath72 by clearing denominators amounts to finding the roots of a degree @xmath73 polynomial in @xmath69 , the above two bullets combine to respectively provide all @xmath74 eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "the following table , computed using sage ( @xcite ) , gives the number of graphs on @xmath3 vertices whose coronal has a denominator of degree @xmath62 ( as a reduced fraction ) , as well as the average degree of this denominator , for @xmath75 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this particular example can also be computed using theorem [ schwenk ] : for @xmath8 and @xmath76 distinct , there is a unique path @xmath77 $ ] from vertex @xmath8 to vertex @xmath76 , so the sum in the theorem reduces to a single term : @xmath78}=f_{i-1}f_{n - j}.\\ ] ] similarly , we find @xmath79 .",
    "summing over all the cofactors gives @xmath80 which reduces to the result computed in proposition [ path ] after some arithmetic .",
    "at the end of @xcite , the authors note that if @xmath81 and @xmath82 are cospectral graphs , then @xmath83 and @xmath84 are also cospectral , and that ( by repeated coronation with @xmath11 ) this leads to an infinite collection of cospectral pairs .",
    "armed with the characteristic polynomial @xmath66 of the corona ( theorem [ bigthm ] ) , we can greatly generalize this observation on two fronts .",
    "[ cospec2 ] if @xmath81 and @xmath82 are cospectral , and @xmath2 is any graph , then @xmath85 and @xmath86 are cospectral .",
    "further , if @xmath87 and @xmath88 are cospectral and @xmath89 , and @xmath1 is any graph , then @xmath90 and @xmath91 are cospectral .",
    "we remark that examples of this second type do indeed exist .",
    "define the _ switching graph _ @xmath92 of a tree @xmath93 with adjacency matrix @xmath94 to be the graph with adjacency matrix @xmath95 and let @xmath96 and @xmath97 be non - isomorphic cospectral trees with cospectral complements ( note that by @xcite , generalizing @xcite , `` almost all '' trees admit a cospectral pair with cospectral complement ) .",
    "then the switching graphs @xmath98 and @xmath99 are non - isomorphic cospectral regular graphs ( see @xcite , construction 3.7 ) , and also have the same coronal by corollary [ reg ] .",
    "corollary [ cospec2 ] now implies that for _ any _ graphs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we have the cospectral pair @xmath100 and @xmath101 and the cospectral pair @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this gives , for example , infinitely many cospectral pairs of graphs with any given graph @xmath1 as an induced subgraph .",
