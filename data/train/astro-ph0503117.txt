    "the cold ( @xmath4  k ) phase of neutral atomic hydrogen gas ( ) is an important probe of the mass , structure , and evolutionary state of the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "although it occupies only a small fraction of the ism volume @xcite , cold  contains @xmath5% of the total gas mass near the sun @xcite . on sub - parsec scales ,",
    "cold  clouds display significant structure ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ; @xcite ) that may be shaped by shocks , turbulence , or magnetic fields . on kiloparsec scales ,",
    "the cold  distribution may trace spiral structure in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "cold  may even offer a window into the process of molecular condensation .",
    "it is often found with molecular gas in the quiescent environments needed for star formation @xcite , and it can be used to study turbulent diffusion @xcite and cosmic - ray dissociation @xcite inside molecular clouds . but cold  without apparent molecular gas is also found ( @xcite ; paper  i ) , sometimes at temperatures too cold for standard equilibrium ism models to explain easily @xcite ; such gas may be cooling and forming .    investigating these issues thoroughly requires mapping cold  over large areas , but this is not straightforward .",
    "the principal  tracer , 21 cm line emission , does not show cold gas conspicuously , since the line brightness is independent of temperature when optically thin and proportional to temperature when optically thick @xcite .",
    "in fact , since  column densities computed from 21 cm line emission presume optically thin conditions , they miss much of the coldest , densest  and underestimate the total mass",
    ". however , the inverse dependence of optical depth on temperature allows cold  to be readily examined in _",
    "absorption_.  continuum absorption ( hica ) studies find that typically 30% of the total  mass is missed by emission columns in the galactic plane @xcite , with almost 50% missed in some cases @xcite .",
    "hica is thus a valuable probe of the cold  phase , but the discrete nature of most continuum backgrounds compromises hica s ability to map the cold gas distribution .",
    "a more suitable alternative is  _ self - absorption _ ( hisa ) , which arises from  gas with an excitation temperature colder than the background  brightness temperature .",
    "since the total galactic  brightness is @xmath6  k , hisa has a built - in temperature filter that allows it to trace cold gas exclusively .",
    "like hica , hisa requires suitable backgrounds , but bright  emission is found over large , continuous areas at low latitude . as a result , hisa is an excellent tool for mapping the structure and distribution of cold galactic .",
    "a thorough hisa survey of the cold  population requires high angular resolution , high radial velocity resolution , and broad sky coverage .",
    "the first two provide a detailed view of hisa structure , with reduced dilution of spatially and spectrally sharp absorption features , and refined estimation of the unabsorbed  brightness , as measured near hisa feature edges in space and velocity .",
    "the third permits the study of a large population of objects , unbiased by any target preselection ( e.g. , molecular clouds ) , allowing the cold  properties to be examined in the context of the larger environment .    due to the effort and",
    "resources required , a hisa survey incorporating all three ingredients has never been published ; the closest approximation is the boston university arecibo  survey , only part of which is nyquist sampled ( @xcite ; t. m. bania 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "two prior arecibo mapping surveys consisted of longitude - velocity or latitude - velocity strip - maps only @xcite .",
    "other hisa surveys have targeted known molecular clouds with single - dish telescopes and little or no imaging @xcite , and until recently only a few isolated objects have been observed with synthesis telescopes @xcite .",
    "fortunately , new technological advances have made  synthesis surveys over large areas possible .",
    "one such effort , the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ; @xcite ) , is the basis of this paper .",
    "the cgps combines a hexagonal grid of full - synthesis fields with single - dish observations to enable the detection of all scales of  structure down to the synthesized beam .",
    "the cgps  data have a @xmath7 beam , 0.824  velocity sampling , and a field - center noise of @xmath8  k in empty channels ; @xmath9 doubles when the 107  primary beam is filled with 100  k emission , and it can be up to 60% greater between field centers . the initial phase of the survey mapped a @xmath10 region along the galactic plane with longitudes @xmath11 and latitudes @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and extensions in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 have followed .",
    "this paper deals solely with the phase  i cgps , which we shall call simply `` the cgps '' for brevity .",
    "paper  i gave a preliminary view of hisa in the cgps , including many small - scale features masked by beam dilution in single - dish surveys .",
    "larger - scale hisa features have also been found in cgps data by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "two other major synthesis surveys , the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; @xcite ) and vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ; @xcite ) , have abundant and intricate hisa populations as well @xcite .      following the first look at cgps hisa given in paper  i",
    ", this paper presents a large hisa survey over the entire @xmath10 cgps .",
    "our intent is to chart all of the cold  in the cgps that is readily detectable as hisa so that the feature population can be studied over a wide area with minimal selection bias .",
    "a companion paper ( @xcite ; hereafter paper  iii ) describes the automated algorithms used in this paper to locate hisa features in the  data cubes and extract them for analysis .",
    "our technique seeks out dark features in the  data with abundant small - scale structure in space and velocity .",
    "this approach succeeds in finding most of the hisa that is conspicuous to the eye .",
    "maps of the detected hisa trace a rich array of cold  features over the breadth of the cgps , including a froth of low - amplitude hisa and a number of elaborate complexes of stronger absorption .",
    "the weak absorption seems well mixed with the general  emission and may arise from small turbulent fluctuations in velocity and temperature in the ism .",
    "many of the stronger absorption features appear to probe cold atomic gas in the velocity reversal of the perseus spiral arm and may trace evolving material in the arm .",
    "below , we summarize our method of hisa identification and extraction (  [ sec : ext ] ) , present the features it finds in the cgps (  [ sec : maps ] ) , and consider the spatial and velocity distributions of the hisa (  [ sec : dist ] ) .",
    "detailed analyses of the properties of the hisa features and their degree of correspondence with molecular gas will be presented separately @xcite .",
    "early results from some of this work have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "in past hisa studies , visual inspection sufficed for identifying self - absorption features , but the large amount of data in a survey like the cgps makes this impractical .",
    "visually identified hisa is also unlikely to be selected in a uniform or repeatable manner . to address these concerns",
    ", we have developed an automated means of searching for hisa in 21 cm spectral line data .",
    "we have also developed a method of interpolating the @xmath16 brightness around the feature in @xmath17 space to obtain the best - constrained estimate of the unabsorbed brightness @xmath18 that would be observed at the feature position in the absence of hisa . from this , the absorption amplitude of the feature is obtained as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the brightness temperature on the feature , and @xmath21 .",
    "full discussions of the workings and evaluation of our hisa search and extraction software are presented in paper  iii , but we summarize key aspects here .",
    "our search method is conservative : we seek  features that can only be identified as hisa .",
    "following the criteria of paper  i , such features have narrower line widths than most emission , steeper line wings , more small - scale angular structure , and a minimum background  brightness .",
    "the last condition excludes narrow gaps between sharp - edged emission features , which are more common in the absence of bright backgrounds . using a variant of the clean algorithm of @xcite , we iteratively remove large - scale emission features from the  data and flag significant negative residuals as hisa .",
    "the clean is performed separately in the spectral and spatial domains , and only features satisfying both searches are retained .",
    "@xmath18 is then estimated by interpolating the @xmath16 brightness around the feature in 3-d .",
    "hisa detections with @xmath22  k are rejected .",
    "detections where the survey noise is unacceptably high are also rejected as untrustworthy .",
    "the clean filtering removes hisa on the largest spectral and spatial scales , but some of this larger structure is recovered by subtracting the flagged absorption from the  data and rerunning the search .",
    "a total of 3 search+extraction iterations were applied to the cgps data .",
    "the search software was tuned to find as much visually identifiable hisa as possible while minimizing false detections .",
    "it was then tested extensively with model  data containing random backgrounds , absorption features , and noise . the absorption extracted by the software",
    "was compared to that put into the models , and the software performance was evaluated as a function of four `` observables '' : @xmath23 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where the latter two measure the local angular and velocity widths of features",
    ". within this 4-d parameter space , we measured @xmath26 , the fraction of input hisa detected , @xmath27 , the fraction of output hisa that represents true detections , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , the measurement drifts between input and output ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we found that hisa meeting our design criteria is generally well detected : @xmath26 is high for hisa significantly stronger than the noise level , larger than a few beams , narrower than a few , and with @xmath32  k. at the same time , the bulk of hisa detections are reliable , with @xmath27 near unity in most parts of the parameter space except those occupied by beam - scale noise fluctuations .",
    "measurement drifts are small in well - detected features , with @xmath33 and @xmath18 being underestimated by a few k due to contamination of @xmath16 by faint , undetected hisa near the feature . where detections are truncated by noise fluctuations or faint @xmath18 , the bias may be somewhat larger .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are both negative in most cases , since incomplete detection makes features appear smaller and narrower . in practice , these effects manifest as the stronger - absorption cores of hisa features being detected when some weaker - absorption envelopes may be missed .",
    "the cgps  data are released in @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) cubes .",
    "all 36 of the phase  i cubes were processed with the hisa identification and extraction software described in  [ sec : ext ] .",
    "the results were then merged into a single data set covering the full cgps .",
    "figure  [ fig : hisa_overview_map ] shows side - by - side @xmath36 and @xmath37 projections of these data , in which @xmath23 is integrated over @xmath38 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the @xmath39 data are sparse enough that most features are readily located in 3-d by comparing the two projections .",
    "figure  [ fig : hisa_overview_map ] is divided into four longitude subranges matching those of figure  7 of @xcite .",
    "the total area mapped by the 193 overlapping fields of the cgps is 656.2  deg@xmath40 , but this includes synthesis field peripheries with substantial noise . to maximize the reliability of our survey",
    ", hisa voxels were required to have cgps field mosaic weights @xmath41 , the lowest weight that occurs between synthesis field centers . since @xmath42",
    ", this allows a maximum noise of 1.618 times the field center value ( see @xcite ) , which is typically @xmath43  k for the @xmath44  k levels of our hisa features . such peripheral clipping and the additional exclusion of 20  strips at mosaic edges by the spatial search algorithm ( see paper  iii , fig .",
    "3 ) reduce the search area to 528.3 deg@xmath40 in a region bounded by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with complete coverage for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , except near the bright radio source cas  a @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ fig : survey_edges_and_c21 ] marks the boundaries of this area .      figure  [ fig : survey_edges_and_c21 ] also plots contours of 21 cm continuum emission ( shown in grayscale in figure  7 of @xcite ) .",
    "where the continuum is bright , hica may `` contaminate '' the cold  sampled by hisa in two different ways : by adding absorption where the  background is too faint for hisa , or by allowing warmer gas to contribute to the absorption than hisa would by itself , since the maximum temperature of the absorbing gas is the brightness temperature of the background  @xmath50 continuum .",
    "both problems are exacerbated by the spotty nature of most bright continuum emission , which adds artificial absorption structure to the hisa map .",
    "our hisa identification software excludes sight lines with hica strong enough for @xmath20 to be significantly less than zero ( paper  iii ) .",
    "apart from special cases involving polarization @xcite , weaker hica can not be separated cleanly from the hisa without knowing the properties of the absorbing gas . in the 4-component radiative transfer model of paper",
    "i , the total hisa+hica amplitude is    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the `` spin '' ( excitation ) temperature of the absorbing gas , @xmath53 is its optical depth , @xmath54 is the fraction of @xmath18 originating behind the absorbing gas , and @xmath55 is the continuum brightness temperature ; all of @xmath55 is assumed to originate in the far background for simplicity .",
    "the absorption from hisa alone is found by setting @xmath56 in equation  ( [ eqn : dt_4comp ] ) , so its fraction of the total is    @xmath57    for @xmath58  k , @xmath59  k , and @xmath60 , this ratio is @xmath61 for @xmath62  k and @xmath63 for @xmath64  k. higher fractions obtain if some of the continuum emission lies in front of the absorbing gas .",
    "constraining the radiative transfer adequately to separate hisa from hica is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "fortunately , most detected cgps hisa is largely hica - free , with only a smooth , faint @xmath65  k background from galactic synchrotron and cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the two most significant exceptions are a small area around the bright  region w3 ( @xmath66 ; e.g. , @xcite ) and a larger area in the extensive cygnus  x complex of  regions and supernova remnants ( @xmath67 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of the remaining hica is in compact features scattered across the cgps area ( fig .",
    "[ fig : survey_edges_and_c21 ] ; see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "a prominent example is the ultracompact region dr  7 ( @xmath68 ; @xcite ) , which produces hica over a wider velocity range than the hisa near @xmath69 in figure  [ fig : hisa_overview_map ] .",
    "in addition to the boundary marked in figure  [ fig : survey_edges_and_c21 ] , hisa detections are also restricted by the requirement that @xmath70  k , since hisa needs bright  backgrounds for it to arise and to be clearly detected (  [ sec : ext ] ) .",
    "the effects of this constraint are illustrated in figure  [ fig : hisa_vs_hie ] , which plots approximate @xmath71  k contours over @xmath36 and @xmath37 maps of detected hisa .",
    "these contours are taken from @xmath72 maps of 20-smoothed cgps  emission , where @xmath72 is the brightest value along the projected axis , thus indicating positions where suitable hisa backgrounds may occur .",
    "the actual @xmath18 used in the hisa identification software is difficult to show in 2-d , but these smoothed maps give a reasonable indication of where hisa detections are possible .",
    "their 70  k levels correspond closely to a number of sharp edges of the hisa distribution .",
    "the cold  gas traced by the hisa may continue beyond these apparent edges in many cases . given the large number of galactic  sight lines and velocities for which @xmath22  k",
    ", it is important to emphasize that the detected hisa population may represent only a small subset of the total cold  population .",
    "the @xmath36 area enclosed by this @xmath18 contour is 398.0 deg@xmath40 . in  [ sec : dist ] , we will consider the fraction of this area covered by detected hisa of different strengths , along with other survey completeness issues .",
    "a detailed analysis of the general hisa distribution is given in ",
    "[ sec : dist ] , and a full discussion of hisa gas properties and correspondences with molecular material will be presented in a separate paper . however",
    ", a few points require initial comment .",
    "figure  [ fig : hisa_overview_map ] shows a broad swath of hisa over the entire length of the survey .",
    "the detection of this hisa immediately confirms that gas radial velocities do not change monotonically with distance in the outer galaxy ( e.g. , from pure differential galactic rotation ) , since any hisa requires background  emission at the same radial velocity as the absorbing gas .",
    "the detection of so _ much _ hisa over such a large area indicates this situation is widespread .",
    "low - amplitude hisa appears almost ubiquitous , arising nearly everywhere that @xmath18 is bright enough for hisa detection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hisa_vs_hie ] ) .",
    "by contrast , darker hisa is more concentrated in both space and velocity , collecting in complexes that often resemble molecular clouds in their structure .",
    "quite strong absorption is found at velocities consistent with both local and perseus arm gas , although at very different longitudes . in this paper ,",
    "`` strong '' simply means large @xmath33 , which could be caused by a variety of factors in equation  ( [ eqn : dt_4comp ] ) .",
    "the strongest hisa is at low velocities and low longitudes , where it coincides with three large co complexes described by @xcite : the nearby cyg  ob7 and cyg  rift complexes and the more distant cyg  x complex that lies beyond the rift along the tangent of solar motion .",
    "the local arm ( @xmath73 ) also has hisa at higher longitudes , including the local hisa filament of paper  i , but this is generally much weaker . whether there is less cold  here",
    "is unclear , since @xmath22  k in many areas .",
    "strong hisa is also found in the perseus arm ( @xmath74 ) , mostly at high longitudes .",
    "the perseus hisa complex of paper  i is now revealed as one of a chain of hisa complexes over a large longitude range .",
    "many sight lines within these detected hisa structures have no corresponding co detection ( paper  i ) , but the hisa velocity distribution is close to that of @xcite ( @xcite ) perseus arm spiral shock @xcite , a point we shall revisit in  [ sec : dist ] .",
    "we find little hisa of any kind for @xmath75 , and only then for @xmath76 .",
    "this hisa is probably in the outer arm , although the outer / perseus boundary is difficult to determine for @xmath77 . in this part of the galaxy ,",
    "hisa detections are limited by @xmath78  k in most areas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hisa_vs_hie ] ) , and where @xmath79  k , much of the background  emission is too finely structured for our search to detect large - scale hisa . as a result , the large hisa shell of @xcite is missed , and only a handful of small features are found .",
    "more outer - arm hisa may remain undetected , and still more cold  may lack sufficient background emission to self - absorb at all .",
    "the high resolution and large area of the cgps allow the thorough mapping of known hisa features and the discovery of many new ones .",
    "we define `` features '' as hisa voxel ( volume - pixel ) clusters in @xmath17 that may or may not correspond to physical `` clouds '' .",
    "cautious interpretation is required , because shadow images do not give a complete picture of reality @xcite .",
    "our hisa features may arise from discrete clouds of cold , from cold concentrations within  clouds , from portions of either where the background  is bright enough for hisa to arise , or from sight - line superpositions of any of these sharing the same radial velocity .",
    "we have compiled a catalog of the most significant hisa features found by our search algorithms in the cgps .",
    "using the full - survey @xmath39 data cube (  [ sec : maps_overview ] ) , we identified contiguous groups of hisa voxels as features , in the same fashion used for @xmath18 estimation .",
    "to minimize hica contamination , all sight lines with @xmath80  k were excluded .",
    "this process identifies thousands of features , most of which are small , low - amplitude `` fluff '' .",
    "the larger , darker features have complex structure that often intertwines with or surrounds neighboring features in 3-d . since such cases suggest a physical relationship , we have simplified the catalog by merging any two features together if the @xmath17 boxes containing each feature overlap and both features satisfy a minimum size requirement . each feature to be merged must have a hisa @xmath17 volume of @xmath81 @xmath82 cgps voxels .",
    "this restriction keeps the widespread fluff from joining all of the detected hisa into a few unrealistically large features that , e.g. , include hisa in both the local and perseus arms .",
    "the most significant features in this merged catalog , defined as those for which the hisa volume is also @xmath83 , are marked in figure  [ fig : major_features ] .",
    "there are 69 such features .",
    "if we apply the  [ sec : maps_general ] criteria for spiral arm membership , 11 features are local arm , 50 are perseus arm , and 8 are outer arm members .",
    "all 69 contain at least some high-@xmath33 voxels , but we do not require feature voxels to have a minimum @xmath33 , since this would identify only feature `` cores '' rather than whole features .",
    "@xmath23 varies across even the most obvious and coherent features , and strong hisa voxels are almost always enveloped in weaker hisa , especially near feature @xmath17 edges .",
    "table  [ tab : major_features ] lists these galactic hisa ( ghisa ) features with measurements of position , extent , @xmath17 volume , @xmath36 area , 3-d integrated absorption , mean and maximum absorption , mean @xmath18 , and three `` diagnostics '' of completeness and reliability described in ",
    "[ sec : maps_rel ] . derived properties like @xmath52 and @xmath84 will be considered in a separate paper .",
    "the features do not fill their extents solidly ; volume filling factors , defined as the volume of hisa voxels divided by the product of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath38 extents , are @xmath85 , with the larger features having lower filling factors on average .",
    "this clumpiness is also reflected in the _ contiguous _ extents , which although not tabulated are @xmath86 and @xmath87 on average , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 in all but the largest 3 or 4 features .",
    "the total hisa volume detected in the cgps is @xmath90 , of which 54.5% is in the features of table  [ tab : major_features ] .",
    "the total cgps hisa integrated absorption is @xmath91 , of which the listed features account for 66.2% .",
    "a comparison against past hisa studies in the cgps region shows that ours reproduces most prior detections while yielding an abundance of new features .",
    "table  [ tab : major_features ] notes past observations of each feature , and table  [ tab : previous_detections ] summarizes previous hisa work in the cgps region , including the numbers of past features we have found . of those that we miss ,",
    "only two from @xcite have @xmath79  k ; these have @xmath92  k instead , where model tests in paper  iii show that our detection sensitivity is high but not 100% .",
    "more striking is that the majority of cgps features in table  [ tab : major_features ] have _ no _ prior detections in the literature .",
    "although the five most conspicuous features were previously known , most features with volumes of @xmath93 and absolute integrated absorptions of @xmath94 are new detections .",
    "altogether , only 11 of the features in table  [ tab : major_features ] were detected before the cgps , and only 7 were even partially mapped .",
    "none has been mapped as thoroughly as in the cgps .    a few caveats on the interpretation of these features should be emphasized .",
    "first , as noted above , velocity crowding may superpose unrelated absorption along the line of sight , especially near the local - arm tangent in cygnus ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "second , despite the merging of some proximate features , @xmath18 variations may artificially fragment large clouds into multiple features or limit their apparent extent , and the survey edges themselves may truncate some features ( e.g. , ghisa 079.88@xmath500.62@xmath5002 , ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 , ghisa 145.01@xmath500.46@xmath9635 , or ghisa 145.81@xmath500.96@xmath9636 ) . finally , the cgps hisa has a very complex structure , and feature definitions under such circumstances are somewhat subjective . in particular , the choice of merging criteria affects the size and number of major features identified , since if smaller features are allowed to merge , fewer and larger features result .",
    "we sought criteria that mimic the eye s identification of features .",
    "these criteria were applied algorithmically to ensure precise measurements and uniform treatment .",
    "the software performance measures @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be used to assess the reliability and completeness of particular hisa feature detections . for reliability , the observables @xmath23 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25",
    "are measured at each hisa voxel @xmath17 position , and the @xmath27 value corresponding to these coordinates in the 4-d parameter space is assigned to @xmath97 . for each feature in table  [ tab : major_features ] , we determined the fractions of its hisa volume and 3-d integrated absorption that are reliably detected as    @xmath98    and    @xmath99    respectively . for the features listed , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , with respective medians of 0.86 and 0.90 . for the survey as a whole , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "since @xmath27 increases with @xmath33 , @xmath104 generally , and features with stronger @xmath105 typically have greater reliability fractions .",
    "a similar analysis of detection completeness in terms of @xmath26 is not possible , because convergent drifts ( e.g. , @xmath106 ) prevent the recovery of the hisa input properties @xmath107 upon which @xmath26 depends .",
    "however , completeness can be partially assessed in terms of the measured property @xmath108 ; for features of appreciable size and strength , @xmath109 converges symmetrically about @xmath110  k ( paper  iii ) , and thus @xmath111 near 80  k. table  [ tab : major_features ] lists @xmath112 , the average @xmath108 per voxel , and @xmath113 , the fraction of voxels for which @xmath114  k. @xmath115 for reasonably strong features with @xmath116  k but declines rapidly for lower @xmath117 ( paper  iii ) . although the amount of undetected hisa can not be quantified , @xmath118 gives the fraction of each feature lying where significant hisa might be missed .",
    "for example , ghisa 139.01@xmath500.96@xmath9640 ( the perseus hisa complex of paper  i ) offers few opportunities to hide strong , undetected hisa .",
    "by contrast , ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 has a much lower @xmath113 , and its high - latitude edge is definitely truncated by @xmath22  k. for the entire cgps hisa set , @xmath119  k and @xmath120 .",
    "ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 is one of the most striking hisa features in the cgps , as shown in figures  [ fig : hisa_overview_map ] , [ fig : major_features ] , and [ fig : real_hisa_id_stage_maps ] .",
    "it has the strongest maximum absorption ( @xmath121  k ) in the survey and the strongest average absorption ( @xmath122  k ) of any major feature .",
    "it also has the largest area of apparent `` solidity '' , with contiguous hisa extents of @xmath123 in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this dark center covers a few square degrees , but it is surrounded by subtle knots and filaments over much larger area , and the feature can even be traced beyond the cgps boundaries to @xmath124 in the single - dish surveys of @xcite and @xcite . as indicated in tables  [ tab : major_features ] & [ tab : previous_detections ] , ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 has been studied by several groups and mapped with 25m - class telescopes .",
    "it coincides with the dust cloud complex kh  141 @xcite and many @xcite dark nebulae , including ldne 999 , 1002 , 1005 , and 1029 .",
    "it may also be associated with other dust clouds over a wider area , since it appears to be part of the large cyg ob7 giant molecular cloud complex mapped in  by @xcite .",
    "its hisa - co correspondence is illustrated in figures  [ fig : real_hisa_id_stage_maps ] and [ fig : real_hisa_id_stage_spectra ] .",

    "we now consider general trends in the distribution of hisa in the cgps and their significance .",

    "we begin with a quantitative discussion of how common hisa is in our survey and what implications this may have for the general picture of the interstellar medium .",

    "[ sec : maps_overview_area ] .",
    "21% of the @xmath36 sight lines passing through this searchable volume have detected hisa , and 47% of the @xmath37 positions have detected hisa .",
    "a relatively small part of the cgps volume is searchable for hisa , because @xmath18 is high only in particular regions .",
    "however , this portion is still large enough to explore significant characteristics of the hisa distribution in the outer galaxy .",
    "detection reliability does not significantly affect these results , since @xmath102 for the full survey (  [ sec : maps_rel ] ) .",
    "a 3.8% occupation of the @xmath17 volume may seem low , but in fact this is quite a large fraction : it implies a linear filling factor of @xmath152 in each dimension for a uniformly random distribution .",
    "these values are almost certainly lower limits , since @xmath153 for @xmath154 , and the abundance of hisa with @xmath155 ( paper  iii , fig .",
    "11 ) suggests that fainter hisa may be at least as common as hisa at the noise level .",
    "figure  [ fig : hisa_coverage ] plots the relative incidence of all cgps hisa voxels with @xmath33 above a given threshhold .",
    "curves are given for all voxels and for those with @xmath156 and 0.99 .",
    "the latter two respectively eliminate about one - half and about two - thirds of the total voxel count , mostly at the weak @xmath33 end where noise contamination is significant .",
    "these curves may be rescaled by the occupation fractions listed above to find the fraction of the survey that contains hisa of a particular minimum strength .",
    "for example , the volume occupied by reasonably strong hisa with @xmath157  k is @xmath158 that of the total hisa population , while hisa with @xmath159  k accounts for less than 1% of the total .",
    "simplisticly , we might assume that the hisa census is complete above some @xmath33 level and extrapolate linearly in log space to lower @xmath33 to find the amplitude for which the volume filling reaches 100% .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath160  k , we find @xmath161  k. this extrapolation is not very trustworthy , since it neglects @xmath28 and the more complicated dependences of @xmath26 , but it suggests that at low enough ( sub - kelvin ) amplitudes , hisa may be truly ubiquitous .",
    "previously , @xcite proposed that faint hisa may cause much of the structure in low - latitude galactic emission profiles , and @xcite have argued that hisa occurs in most  spectra , even if it is not always detectable .",
    "our cgps hisa census is consistent with these views . at the very least ,",
    "our survey approaches the confusion limit for hisa detections .      as noted above , hisa with low @xmath33",
    "is more frequent and more smoothly distributed , while stronger hisa is more rare and more clumped into distinct features .",
    "this behavior can be inferred from the @xmath23 maps in figure  [ fig : hisa_overview_map ] , the incidence curves in figure  [ fig : hisa_coverage ] , and the loose @xmath162 and @xmath163 property correlations in paper  iii , figure  11 .",
    "figure  [ fig : strength_vs_dispersion ] shows the relationship between hisa amplitude and scale more explicitly . here",
    "we plot the rms dispersions @xmath164 and @xmath165 of the angular and velocity separations between voxel pairs in the survey .",
    "for every hisa voxel in every cgps mosaic , the distances to its hisa neighbors along lines of constant @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath38 were measured , and rms variations of these measurements were binned by @xmath166 , the absolute amplitude of the fainter of the two voxels in question .",
    "the results , combined for all 36 mosaics , show that weak hisa is more diffusely distributed than strong hisa in both space and velocity .",
    "this is not a contradiction of the loose correlation of @xmath33 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 in paper  iii , figure  11 , since those measured _",
    "contiguous _ rather than general extent . instead",
    ", the two trends together imply that strong hisa is concentrated into more solid complexes , while weak hisa is spread out in a more porous fashion .",
    "the maximum dispersion scales for the weakest hisa are @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "once @xmath166 exceeds the  noise level of @xmath169  k , both dispersions drop steadily , with the steepest descent near @xmath170  k. at higher amplitudes , the descent slows and approaches pseudo - asymptotes of @xmath171 and @xmath172 the former is a typical scale for strong hisa features , while the latter corresponds to a 1-channel separation . above @xmath173",
    "k , angular coherence is lost , the features break into smaller pieces that quickly approach the beam scale , and even 1-channel separations start dropping out when only the maximum absorption channel is sampled .",
    "when converted to gaussian fwhm , the maximum velocity scale approaches the velocity width of the brightest part of a spiral arm in  emission , and the minimum velocity scale approaches the narrowest linewidths that can be sampled by the cgps .",
    "angular fwhm are less physically meaningful since the hisa angular structure is complex , but the maximum angular scale is consistent with the @xmath174  size of the cgps mosaics in which the measurements were made , implying that the weakest hisa has no preferred angular distribution either .",
    "thus , the general trend in both angle and velocity is from weak hisa `` fluff '' (  [ sec : maps_feature_catalog ] ) dispersed over the entire measurable area down to discrete , strong hisa features .",
    "the curves in figure  [ fig : strength_vs_dispersion ] include the entire cgps hisa data set , but similar trends are seen in different spiral arms when analyzed separately , or at different longitudes in different mosaics . only the range of strongest absorption and the scale of maximum dispersion change from one location to another .",
    "for example , the local - arm dispersions are larger in both angle and velocity than the perseus - arm dispersions , and more strong hisa is found in the local arm , at least in ghisa 079.88@xmath500.62@xmath5002 and ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 .      hisa offers a unique opportunity to study gas motions in the outer galaxy , because its radiative transfer requires background emission at the same radial velocity as the absorbing .",
    "hisa detections with @xmath175 require departures from pure circular differential rotation , which predicts only one distance per @xmath176 in this longitude range , apart from the degeneracy at @xmath177 .",
    "two types of cgps hisa are found : ( 1 ) strong hisa with its accompanying weak @xmath17 envelopes , and ( 2 ) unassociated `` fluff '' that makes up the rest of the weak hisa population .",
    "we suggest that these two types are produced by different mechanisms .",
    "turbulence adds small - scale , random perturbations to the galactic velocity field .",
    "these are likely to be very common but should have small velocity amplitudes and little spatial coherence .",
    "turbulence may also produce cold gas for absorption via departures from equilibrium conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we propose that turbulent @xmath178 fluctuations are the source of the weak hisa `` fluff '' in the cgps .",
    "the fluff lacks coherent large - scale structure , and it occurs in all parts of the cgps where @xmath79  k , suggesting that it is ubiquitous and well - mixed with the general .",
    "turbulence can not explain the strong hisa and weak envelopes ; this absorption is concentrated into discrete and often large - scale features with well - defined edges . although brighter @xmath18 makes it easier to see , such hisa does not appear everywhere that @xmath18 is bright enough , so a more organized process than turbulence is needed .",
    "the large amplitude of strong hisa is also problematic for the turbulent explanation .",
    "high @xmath33 can result from a high @xmath55 , @xmath18 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 or a low @xmath52 ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : dt_4comp ] ) .",
    "high @xmath55 is rare in cgps hisa , and we have excluded it where it might affect our analyses . @xmath23 and @xmath18 are poorly correlated at best ( paper  iii , fig .  11 ) , and neither @xmath18 nor @xmath54 is likely to change abruptly and frequently enough to produce the sharp edges of strong hisa features . thus strong , discrete hisa must arise from significant changes in @xmath53 , @xmath52 , or both . in practice , these absorption enhancements resemble clouds or cloud complexes .",
    "spiral density waves add large - scale , organized perturbations to the galactic velocity field .",
    "these are less common than turbulent fluctuations but should have large velocity amplitudes and significant spatial coherence .",
    "they may also be a natural source of cold gas .",
    "spiral waves and their associated shocks have long been thought to drive the formation of dense interstellar clouds and massive stars in galactic disks @xcite , but the full details of the gas dynamics and evolution are complex and difficult to study . in face - on external galaxies ,",
    "spiral structure is simple to observe , but spatial resolution is limited by distance ( e.g. , m81 : @xcite ) . by contrast , spatial resolution is much better in the milky way , but our internal perspective makes the line of sight geometry difficult to untangle .",
    "hisa s sensitivity to velocity reversals is an asset in this situation .",
    "the nearby perseus arm gives a detailed view of spiral structure and the density wave phenomenon .",
    "@xcite modeled the gas distribution and kinematics in the perseus spiral shock .",
    "figure  [ fig : roberts_shock ] illustrates his model s gas density and velocity vs.  distance along the line of sight and the @xmath37 distribution of the gas passing through the arm .",
    "hica studies have presented evidence in support of this model in a few sight lines toward bright continuum sources @xcite .",
    "a more complete picture of the velocity reversal is possible with hisa , which has a much more extensive background than hica . in the cgps , strong perseus hisa is visible over a wide area ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : hisa_overview_map ] ) , as would be expected for a neighboring spiral arm .",
    "figure  [ fig : hisa_lv_shock ] compares the @xmath37 distribution of strong ( @xmath179  k ) hisa to the spiral `` shock ridge '' of @xcite . in his model",
    ", the gas slows as it enters the arm shock , reaches a maximum negative - velocity departure from the standard rotation curve speed , and then rebounds toward a positive - going `` velocity hill '' and the normal rotation speed as it moves on through the rest of the arm and out the back ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roberts_shock ] ) .",
    "we propose that the strong hisa is in or slightly downstream of the shock ridge , the point just behind the shock where the gas is densest , and that  emission on the far side of the velocity hill serves as a background with the same velocity as the absorbing gas . in support of this assertion ,",
    "most of the strong perseus hisa lies on the shock ridge or at more positive velocities for @xmath180 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hisa_lv_shock ] ) . considering that the shock model does not address structural inhomogeneities in the ism ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) ,",
    "the agreement is quite reasonable ; even without prior lumpiness , the shock process itself is expected to introduce some @xmath37 structure in the cold gas distribution @xcite .",
    "the local arm is a more ambiguous case .",
    "its two largest features , ghisa 079.88@xmath500.62@xmath5002 and ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 , are associated with known co complexes either near the sun or along the local arm tangent .",
    "the local co clouds are identified with the great rift system of dust clouds @xcite , which may be related to a ring of expanding material in gould s belt @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 has been suggested to trace a spiral shock in the local arm @xcite .",
    "this scenario conflicts with that of a local arm shock in the galactic center direction @xcite , but it is consistent with stellar streaming results @xcite and naturally explains the presence of background  emission with the same velocity .",
    "however , the local arm is probably not a major spiral feature , and the dynamics of its stars and gas may instead have been shaped by passage through a `` real '' spiral arm 100  myr ago @xcite .",
    "whichever picture is correct , the presence of background emission at the right velocites must be explained .",
    "while the tangent of solar motion enhances hisa visibility in some areas , it is not clear that the tangent can provide adequate backgrounds for all of the strong local hisa ; e.g. , most of ghisa 091.90@xmath503.27@xmath9603 has @xmath181 .",
    "a local spiral density wave shock might provide backgrounds at such longitudes , but no quantitative model predictions are available to compare against the cgps hisa data .    as a general caveat , we note that one well - organized shock per arm may be simplistic : non - grand - design galaxies may have more flocculent shock structure , as suggested by the multiplicity of dust lanes in _ hubble space telescope _",
    "images of the backlit galaxy ngc 3314 @xcite , and even some presumably grand - design spirals may be more complicated ( e.g. , m51 : @xcite ) .",
    "the milky way is unlikely to be a grand - design spiral , and arguments for multiple shocks in the perseus arm  data have been made @xcite .",
    "hisa features in the inner galaxy have also been proposed to trace spiral shock material @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported hisa tracing what appears to be several spiral arms over a large longitude range in the inner galaxy .",
    "these results will be presented in more detail in a separate paper on hisa mapped with the vla galactic plane survey ( s. j. gibson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "strong hisa requires high @xmath53 , low @xmath52 , or both (  [ sec : dist_kinmech_turb ] ) .",
    "the strong perseus hisa @xmath37 distribution appears to trace cold  immediately downstream of the spiral shock described by @xcite .",
    "passage through a spiral density wave could cause a drop in gas temperature and an increase in density relative to the ambient diffuse atomic medium .    in the classical picture",
    ", neutral atomic gas enters the trailing edge of a spiral arm and is decelerated and compressed in the spiral shock ; its increased density then leads to rapid cooling ,  condensation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and star formation .",
    "elements of this process have been studied by @xcite in co and  emission in the w3/4/5 region of the perseus arm , and hisa in this area has been proposed to trace sites of molecular formation @xcite .",
    "the cgps allows this phenomenon to be investigated over a much wider area .",
    "since the perseus arm hisa is at the right velocity to trace the cold  that may be forming , and it often lacks co detections at the same positions @xcite , it may probe the atomic - to - molecular phase transition in the spiral shock environment , or at least  clouds that have not yet formed co , which could take much longer @xcite .    alternatively",
    ", density waves may only concentrate pre - existing molecular gas rather than causing an actual phase transition @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "hisa does not arise from `` pre - molecular '' clouds , but instead from purely atomic cold  clouds or trace  in preexisting  clouds that have been `` piled up '' by the spiral density wave without undergoing a phase change .",
    "@xcite argued that this is occurring in m51 , where the peak brightness in the arms falls slightly `` downstream '' of the densest regions traced by co and nonthermal radio continuum emission .",
    "however , they noted that their interpretation could be altered if the densest regions contained cold , finely - structured , which would not dominate the brightness temperature .",
    "our cgps hisa results indicate that this is quite plausible .",
    "@xcite s ( @xcite )  observations were not sensitive to spin temperatures of @xmath182  k , which are similar to those found for strong perseus hisa in paper  i , and their physical resolution of @xmath183  pc@xmath40 in m51 would cover a @xmath184 area of the perseus arm at a distance of 2.5  kpc ; this is several times larger than the @xmath185 integrated @xmath36 area of the cgps perseus hisa .",
    "still , even if considerable cold  is hidden in the spiral shock regions of m51 , it is a separate question whether this  is in mostly atomic or mostly molecular clouds ; if the latter , the phase change picture remains open to question .",
    "we will explore these issues in greater detail in a separate paper investigating the gas properties and degree of molecular association of the cgps hisa @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a comprehensive survey of  self - absorption ( hisa ) features in the initial @xmath10 phase of the arcminute - resolution canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) .",
    "the cgps hisa is a new tool for examining the detailed structure and distribution of cold clouds in a large area of the outer galactic disk .    using clean - based spatial and spectral filter algorithms and full 3-d interpolation of the off - feature brightness to estimate the unabsorbed intensity along the feature sight line",
    ", we extracted a set of hisa features that extend over the entire area of the survey where conditions allow detection , with sensitivity limits consistent with the noise and resolution properties of the  data .",
    "we compiled a catalog of contiguous , isolated features exceeding a minimum total absorption threshhold .",
    "a comparison of this catalog against prior hisa studies within the cgps borders shows that we reproduce the majority of prior discoveries , with misses generally due to faint backgrounds occurring outside the range of our defined search parameters . at the same time",
    ", we identify a large number of new features not previously reported and image all hisa features in unprecedented detail .",
    "small hisa structures can now be examined in the context of larger ones , and many trends in the general distribution become clear , such as the the concentration of strong hisa into a couple of very large complexes at local velocities , and a similar concentration of strong hisa into a long series of complexes in the perseus arm .",
    "statistically , the hisa detections fill a significant fraction of the searchable volume and suggest that the faintest hisa may be ubiquitous in the galactic plane .",
    "this weak hisa `` fluff '' also appears to have little large - scale coherent structure in space or velocity but is as widespread as the available backgrounds allow .",
    "by contrast , strong hisa , which is much less abundant , is concentrated into larger , more discrete , and relatively solid structures .",
    "although the weak fluff and strong features occur within a continuum of amplitudes and other properties , we suggest they are made visible by two separate mechanisms .",
    "physically , the weak fluff may be interpreted as a low - intensity population of small , slightly cool features scattered throughout the ambient ism , which are produced and revealed by turbulent fluctuations in temperature and velocity .",
    "the strong hisa , on the other hand , requires significant density enhancements and/or very cold gas to produce its large absorption amplitudes , and it needs a large - scale background at the right velocity to absorb against in the outer galaxy .",
    "we propose that the velocity reversal of the perseus arm s spiral density wave provides the background for the strong hisa in this location , while the strength of the absorption is due to compression and cooling from the spiral shock .",
    "spiral arms have long been thought to host the transformation of atomic gas into molecular clouds prior to forming new stars , but this has been very difficult to study in our own galaxy .",
    "if hisa is revealing cold  evolving into  in a nearby spiral arm , this offers the exciting prospect of examining the molecular condensation process in great detail .",
    "this paper is the second in an ongoing series investigating hisa at high resolution in the galactic plane .",
    "a companion paper ( paper  iii ) describes the hisa search and extraction algorithms at length , along with detailed evaluations of their reliability and completeness .",
    "a subsequent paper will analyze the cgps hisa and co distributions together and the gas properties implied for the hisa by available constraints .",

    "<S> we compile a catalog of the most significant features in our survey and compare our detections against those in the literature . within the parameters of our search , </S>",
    "<S> we find nearly all previously detected features and identify many new ones . </S>",
    "<S> the cgps shows hisa in much greater detail than any prior survey and allows both new and previously - discovered features to be placed into the larger context of galactic structure . in space and radial velocity , faint hisa is detected virtually everywhere that the  emission background is sufficiently bright . </S>",
    "<S> this ambient hisa population may arise from small turbulent fluctuations of temperature and velocity in the neutral interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , stronger hisa is organized into discrete complexes , many of which follow a longitude - velocity distribution that suggests they have been made visible by the velocity reversal of the perseus arm s spiral density wave . </S>",
    "<S> the cold revealed in this way may have recently passed through the spiral shock and be on its way to forming molecules and , eventually , new stars . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is the second in a series examining hisa at high angular resolution . </S>",
    "<S> a companion paper ( paper  iii ) describes our hisa search and extraction algorithms in detail . </S>"
