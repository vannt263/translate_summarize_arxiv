    "commonly found in both open and globular clusters ( gcs ) , blue stragglers ( bss ) appear as an extension of the main - sequence ( ms ) in cluster colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , occuyping the region that is just brighter and bluer than the main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) @xcite .",

    "first proposed by @xcite , bss have also been hypothesized to form by mass - transfer from an evolving primary onto a normal ms companion via roche lobe overflow .    despite numerous formation mechanisms",
    "having been proposed , a satisfactory explanation to account for the presence of bss in star clusters eludes us still .",
    "whatever the dominant bs formation mechanism(s ) operating in dense clusters , it is now thought to somehow involve multiple star systems .",
    "this was shown to be the case in even the dense cores of gcs @xcite where collisions between single stars are thought to occur frequently @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the numbers of bss in the cores of a large sample of gcs correlate with the core masses .",
    "we argued that our results are consistent with what is expected if bss are descended from binary stars since this would imply a dependence of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of bss in the core , @xmath2 is the binary fraction in the core and @xmath3 is the total stellar mass contained within the core .",
    "@xcite also showed that at least @xmath4 of the bss in the old open cluster ngc 188 have binary companions .",
    "although the nature of these companions remains unknown , it is clear that binaries played a role in the formation of these bss .",
    "blue stragglers are typically concentrated in the dense cores of globular clusters where the high stellar densities should result in a higher rate of stellar encounters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "whether or not this fact is directly related to bs formation remains unclear , since mass segregation also acts to migrate bss ( or their progenitors ) into the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "several studies have provided evidence that bss show a bimodal spatial distribution in some gcs @xcite . in these clusters ,",
    "the bs numbers are the highest in the central cluster regions and decrease with increasing distance from the cluster centre until a second rise occurs in the cluster outskirts .",
    "this drop in bs numbers at intermediate cluster radii is often referred to as the `` zone of avoidance '' .",
    "some authors have suggested that it is the result of two separate formation mechanisms occurring in the inner and outer regions of the cluster , with mass - transfer in primordial binaries dominating in the latter and stellar collisions dominating in the former @xcite .",
    "conversely , mass segregation could also give rise to a `` zone of avoidance '' for bss if the time - scale for dynamical friction exceeds the average bs lifetime in only the outskirts of gcs that exhibit this radial trend ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this time - scale is comparable to the half - mass relaxation time but much longer than the central relaxation time for the majority of the clusters in our sample @xcite .",
    "this suggests that core parameters such as the central density and the core radius will typically change in a time @xmath21 since the time - scale on which these parameters vary is the central relaxation time @xcite .",
    "therefore , our assumption of constant rates and cluster parameters is not strictly correct , however it provides a suitable starting point for our model .",

    "we assume a time - independent core binary fraction of 10% for all clusters , and an average semi - major axis of 2 au . this semi - major axis corresponds roughly to the hard - soft boundary for most of the clusters in our sample , defined by setting the average binary orbital energy equal to the kinetic energy of an average star in the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we treat both the core binary fraction and the average binary semi - major axis as free parameters , and explore a range of possibilities using the available observations as a guide for realistic values .",

    "although we do not know the rate of bs formation from binary star evolution , we expect a general relation of the form n@xmath11 = @xmath21/@xmath42 for the number of bss produced from binary mergers in the last @xmath21 years , where @xmath42 is the average time between bs formation events due to binary star evolution .",
    "we can express the number of bss formed from binary star evolution in the last @xmath21 years as : @xmath43 where n@xmath44 is the total number of objects ( i.e. single and binary stars ) in the core and f@xmath45 is the fraction of binary stars that evolved internally to form bss within the last @xmath21 years . we treat f@xmath45 as a free parameter since it is likely to depend on the mass - ratio , period and eccentricity distributions characteristic of the binary populations of evolved gc cores , for which data is scarce at best .",
    "due to the relatively small sizes of the bs populations considered , the migration of bss into or out of the core is an important consideration when calculating the predicted numbers .",
    "in other words , we are dealing with relatively small number statistics and every blue straggler counts . in order to approximate the number of stars in the core as a function of time ,",
    "two competing effects need to be taken into account : ( 1 ) mass stratification / segregation ( or , equivalently , dynamical friction ) and ( 2 ) kicks experienced during dynamical interactions .",
    "these effects are accounted for with the variables n@xmath12 and n@xmath13 in equation  [ eqn : number - bss ] , respectively .",
    "blue stragglers are among the most massive stars in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if @xmath52 at a given distance from the cluster centre , then any bss formed at this radius in the last @xmath21 years will not have had sufficient time to migrate into the core by the current cluster age .",
    "the maximum radius r@xmath53 at which bss can have formed in the last @xmath21 years and still have time to migrate into the core via dynamical friction is given by setting @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , n@xmath12 depends only on the number of bss formed in the last @xmath21 years at a distance from the cluster centre smaller than r@xmath53 .    in order to estimate the contribution to n@xmath55 in equation  [ eqn : number - bss ] from bss formed outside the core",
    ", we calculate the number of bss formed in radial shells between the cluster centre and r@xmath53 .",
    "each shell is taken to be one core radius thick , and we calculate the contribution from each formation mechanism in every shell .",
    "this is done by assuming a constant ( average ) density and velocity dispersion in each shell . specifically , we estimated the density and velocity dispersion at the half - way point in each shell using our single - mass king models , and used these to set average values .",
    "the number of bss expected to have migrated into the core within the last @xmath21 years can be written : @xmath56 where @xmath57 refers to the core , @xmath58 refers to the shell immediately outside the core , etc . and",

    "the time - scale for dynamical friction in shell @xmath64 is denoted by @xmath65 , and the factor ( 1 - @xmath65/@xmath21 ) is included to account for the fact that we are assuming a constant formation rate for bss , so that not every bs formed in shells outside the core will have sufficient time to fall in by the current cluster age .",
    "it is typically the least massive stars that are ejected from 1 + 2 and 2 + 2 interactions as single stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "combined with conservation of momentum , this suggests that bss are the least likely to be ejected from dynamical encounters with velocities higher than the central velocity dispersion due to their large masses .",
    "this has been confirmed by several studies of numerical scattering experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on this , we expect that n@xmath13 should be very small and so , as a first approximation , we take n@xmath66 .",
    "however , we also explore the effects of a non - zero n@xmath13 by assigning a kick velocity to all bss at birth .",
    "if dynamical interactions play a role in bs formation , we might naturally expect bss to be imparted a recoil velocity at birth ( or shortly before ) due to momentum conservation .",
    "we will return to this assumption in section  [ results ] .",
    "our model contains 4 free parameters , which correspond to the fraction of outcomes that produce a blue straggler for each formation mechanism ( 1 + 1 collisions , 1 + 2 collisions , 2 + 2 collisions , and binary star evolution ) .",
    "these are the @xmath67 values described in the previous section : @xmath68 .",
    "we assume that these values are constant throughout each cluster , and are also constant between clusters . by fitting the predictions of our model to the observational data",
    ", we can determine best - fit values for each of these @xmath67 parameters , and therefore make predictions about which blue straggler formation processes are more important .    in order to determine the best values for these @xmath67 parameters",
    ", we need an appropriate statistical test . for this",
    ", we follow the approach of @xcite .",
    "the number of bss seen in the core of a globular cluster can be described by poisson statistics . in particular , the probability of observing @xmath69 sources when @xmath70 are expected is : @xmath71 we can calculate a probability for each cluster , and then calculate an overall probability @xmath72 for the model by multiplying the individual @xmath73 values .",
    "we can then vary the @xmath67 values to maximize this value .    in practice , these @xmath73 values are typically of order ten percent per cluster , and with 35 clusters , the value of @xmath72 quickly becomes extremely small .",
    "therefore we chose to work with a modified version of this value : the deviance of our model to the saturated model .",
    "a saturated model is one in which the observed number of sources is exactly equal to the expected number in each cluster . in other words",
    ", this is the best that we can possibly do . however , because of the nature of poisson statistics , the probability @xmath73 of such a model ( calculated by setting @xmath74 in equation  [ eqn : stats ] ) is not equal to 1 , but in fact has some smaller value . for the numbers of blue stragglers in our clusters ,",

    "we also tried changing our assumption for the average bs lifetime .",
    "we explored a range of plausible lifetimes based on values found throughout the literature .",
    "specifically , we explored the range 0.5 - 5 gyrs .",
    "we find that at the low end of this range , our model fits become increasingly poor .",
    "this is because lower values for @xmath21 correspond to smaller values for r@xmath53 and decrease the term ( 1 - t@xmath97/@xmath21 ) in equation  [ eqn : n - in ] .",
    "this reduces the contribution to the total predicted numbers from bss formed outside the core that fall in via dynamical friction .",
    "conversely , our model fits improve for @xmath98 gyrs since this corresponds to a larger contribution to n@xmath55 from n@xmath12 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that this same effect can be had by increasing the number of bss formed outside the core , since this would also serve to increase n@xmath12 in equation  [ eqn : number - bss ] .",
    "this can be accomplished by , for instance , increasing the binary fraction outside the core ( which would increase the number of bss formed from binary star evolution outside the core that migrate in due to dynamical friction ) relative to inside the core .",
    "this seems unlikely , however , given that observations of low - density globular clusters and open clusters suggest that their binary fractions tend to drop off rapidly outside the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will return to this issue in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the best possible match to the observations is found by adopting an average bs lifetime of 5 gyrs along with the relation for f@xmath34 provided in equation  [ eqn : sollima07 ] with f@xmath92 .",
    "the predictions of our model are shown in figure  [ fig : model_best_rmax_sollima_10min_tbs50 ] for these best - fitting model parameters .",
    "as shown , the agreement between our model predictions and the observed numbers is excellent .",
    "the best agreement is found by adopting an average bs lifetime of 5 gyrs , however the agreement is comparably excellent down to slightly less than @xmath99 gyrs .",
    "although increasing @xmath21 does contribute to improving the agreement between our model predictions and the observations , the effect is minor compared to the improvement that can be found by changing our assumption for the binary fraction .",
    "this is apparent upon comparing figure  [ fig : model_best_rmax_sollima_10min_tbs50 ] to figure  [ fig : model_best_rmax_sollima_10min_tbs15 ] .     with f@xmath92 .",
    "the symbols used to indicate the observed and predicted numbers are the same as in figure  [ fig : model_best ] .",
    "the best - fitting model parameters used to calculate the predicted numbers are f@xmath79 , f@xmath100 , f@xmath101 , and f@xmath102 .",
    "the agreement with the observations is excellent for these best - fitting values .",
    "[ fig : model_best_rmax_sollima_10min_tbs50 ] ]      in order to explore the sensitivity of our results to our assumption for r@xmath53 , we also tried setting n@xmath12 equal to the total number of bss expected to form within 10 r@xmath59 for all clusters . for comparison , for an average bs lifetime of @xmath20 gyrs , r@xmath53 ranges from 2 - 15 r@xmath59 for the clusters in our sample . despite implementing this change , our results remained the same .",
    "this is because the largest contribution to the total number of bss comes from those bss formed in the first few shells immediately outside the core that migrate in due to dynamical friction .",
    "several gcs have been reported to show evidence for a decrease in their binary fractions with increasing distance from the cluster centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is often significant , with binary fractions decreasing by up to a factor of a few within only a few core radii from the cluster centre .",
    "based on this , our assumption that f@xmath34 is independent of the distance from the cluster centre likely results in an over - estimate of the true binary fraction at large cluster radii . in order to quantify the possible implications of this for our results , we tried setting f@xmath34 @xmath103 for all shells outside the core .",
    "although this assumption is certainly an under - estimate for the true binary fraction outside the core , our results remain the same ( albeit the agreement with the observations is considerably worse than for most of our previous model assumptions ) . once again , the best - fitting model parameters suggest that most bss are formed from binary star evolution , with a non - negligible ( i.e. up to a few tens of a percent in some clusters ) contribution from binary - binary collisions .",
    "our results indicate that , if the binary fraction is negligible outside the core , then the contribution from bss that migrate into the core due to dynamical friction is also negligible .",
    "this is because the time between 1 + 1 collisions increases rapidly outside the core , and every other bs formation mechanism requires binary stars to operate .",
    "we also explored the effects of assuming a non - zero value for n@xmath13 in equation  [ eqn : number - bss ] by imparting a constant kick velocity to all bss at birth . using conservation of energy , we calculated the cluster radius to which bss should be kicked upon formation , and used the time - scale for dynamical friction at the kick radius to calculate the fraction of bss expected to migrate back into the core within a time @xmath21 .",
    "regardless of our assumption for the kick velocity , this did not improve the deviance for any of our best - fitting model parameters .",
    "we investigated the dependence of our results on our assumption for the average binary semi - major axis .",
    "however , this had a very small effect on our results .",
    "this is because only n@xmath24 and n@xmath25 depend on the average semi - major axis , and neither of these terms dominated bs production regardless of our model assumptions .",
    "only f@xmath25 is non - zero for our best - fitting models however , as before , it consistently suggests that far fewer bss should be formed from 2 + 2 collisions than from binary star evolution .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an analytic model to investigate bs formation in globular clusters .",
    "our model predicts the number of bss in the cluster core at the current cluster age by estimating the number that should have either formed there from stellar collisions and binary star evolution , or migrated in via dynamical friction after forming outside the core . we have compared the results of our model predictions for a variety of input parameters to observed bs numbers in 35 gcs taken from the catalogue of @xcite .    what has our model told us about bs formation in dense cluster environments ?",
    "the agreement between the predictions of our model and the observations is excellent if we assume that :    * binary star evolution dominates bs formation , however at least some contribution from 2 + 2 collisions ( most of which occur in the core ) must also be included in the total predicted numbers .",
    "although it is clear that including a contribution from dynamical encounters gives the best possible match to the observations , it is not clear how exactly this is accomplished in real star clusters .",
    "does the cluster dynamics increase bs numbers via direct collisions ? or do dynamical interactions somehow modify primordial binaries to initiate more mass - transfer events ? we will return to this point below . * the binary fraction in the core is inversely correlated with the total cluster luminosity , similar to the empirical relations found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also require a minimum core binary fraction of @xmath104 .",
    "the inverse dependence of f@xmath34 on the total cluster mass contributes to a better agreement with the observations at the low - mass end of the distribution of cluster masses , whereas the imposed condition that f@xmath105 contributes to improving the agreement at the high - mass end .",
    "* bss formed outside the core that migrate in by the current cluster age contribute to the total predicted numbers . *",
    "the average bs lifetime is roughly a few ( @xmath5 3 - 5 ) gyrs , since this increases the fraction of bss formed outside the core that will have sufficient time to migrate in due to dynamical friction .",
    "our model can only provide a reasonable fit to the observations for all cluster masses if we assume that the cluster binary fraction is inversely proportional to the total cluster mass .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possibility that such an inverse proportionality could arise as a result of the fact that the rate of two - body relaxation is also inversely proportional to the cluster mass @xcite .",
    "consequently , since binaries tend to be the most massive objects in gcs , they should quickly migrate into the core in low - mass clusters , contributing to an increase in the core binary fraction over time @xcite .",
    "this process should operate on a considerably longer time - scale in very massive gcs since the time - scale for two - body relaxation is very long",
    ". mass segregation could then contribute to the observed sub - linear dependence of bs numbers on the core masses by acting to preferentially migrate the binary star progenitors of bss into the cores of low - mass clusters .",
    "this is one example of how a direct link could arise between the observed properties of bs populations and the dynamical histories of their host clusters .",
    "although this scenario is interesting to consider , we can not rule out the possiblity that an anti - correlation between the core binary fraction and the total cluster mass could be a primordial property characteristic of gcs at birth .",
    "when interpreting our results , it is important to bear in mind that binary star evolution and dynamical interactions involving binaries may not always contribute to bs formation independently .",
    "for example , dynamics could play an important role in changing the distribution of binary orbital parameters so that mass - transfer occurs more commonly in some clusters .",
    "one way to perhaps compensate for this effect would be to include a factor of @xmath106 ( where @xmath39 is the average binary semi - major axis ) in equation  [ eqn : n - bin ] . this would serve to account for the fact that we might naively expect clusters populated by more close binaries to be more likely to have a larger fraction of their binary populations undergo mass - transfer .",
    "this does not , however , guarantee that more bss will form since our poor understanding of binary star evolution prevents us from being able to predict the outcomes of these mass - transfer events , and whether or not they will form bss . moreover ,",
    "little is known about the distribution of orbital parameters characteristic of the binary populations in globular clusters , and how they are typically modified by the cluster dynamics . for these reasons , the interpretation of our results",
    "must be done with care in order to ensure that reliable conclusions can be drawn . in general",
    ", our results suggest that binary stars play a crucial role in bs formation in dense gcs . in order to obtain the best possible agreement with the observations , an enhancement in bs formation from dynamical encounters",
    "is required in at least some clusters relative to what is expected by assuming a simple population of binaries evolving in isolation .",
    "it is not clear from our results , however , how exactly this occurs in real star clusters .",
    "dynamics could enhance bs formation directly by causing stellar collisions , or this could also occur indirectly if the cluster dynamics somehow induces episodes of mass - transfer by reducing the orbital separations of binaries .",
    "but in which clusters is bs formation the most strongly influenced by the cluster dynamics ?",
    "unfortunately , no clear trends have emerged from our analysis that provide a straight - forward answer to this question .",
    "however , our results are consistent with dynamical interactions playing a more significant role in more massive clusters ( although this does not imply that the cluster dynamics does not also contribute in low - mass clusters )",
    ". this could be due to the fact that more massive clusters also tend to have higher central densities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore higher collision rates .",
    "this picture is , broadly speaking , roughly consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "these authors considered the observed dependence ( or lack thereof ) of bs numbers on the total cluster masses presented in @xcite , and suggested that primordial binary evolution and stellar collisions dominate bs production in low- and high - mass clusters , respectively .",
    "our model neglects the dynamical evolution of gcs and the resulting changes to their global properties , including the central density , velocity dispersion , core radius and binary fraction . as a young cluster evolves , dynamical processes",
    "like mass segregation and stellar evaporation tend to result in a smaller , denser core . within a matter of a few half - mass relaxation times",
    ", a gravothermal instability has set in and the collapse ensues on a time - scale determined by the rate of heat flow out of the core ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we are focussing on the last @xmath21 years of cluster evolution , a sufficiently late period in the lives of most gcs that gravothermal collapse will have long since taken over as the primary driving force affecting the stellar concentration in the core .",
    "most of the gcs in our sample should currently be in a phase of core contraction @xcite , and their central densities and core radii should have been steadily decreasing over the last @xmath21 years .",
    "therefore , by using the currently observed central cluster parameters and assuming that they remained constant over the last @xmath21 years , we have effectively calculated upper limits for the encounter rates .",
    "this could suggest that we have over - estimated the importance of dynamical interactions for bs formation . on the other hand , some theoretical models of gc evolution suggest that the hard binary fraction in the core of a dense stellar system will generally increase with time ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can be understood as an imbalance between the migration of binaries into the core via mass segregation and the destruction of binaries in the core via both dynamical encounters and their internal evolution .",
    "this could suggest that our estimate for the number of bss formed from binary star evolution should also be taken as an upper limit .",
    "the key point is that gc evolution can act to increase the number of bss in the cluster core via several different channels .",
    "the effects we have discussed should typically be small , however , since @xmath21 is much shorter than the cluster age @xcite and any changes to global cluster properties that occur during this time will often be small .",
    "our model adopts the same values for all free parameters in all clusters .",
    "in particular , this is the case for several global cluster properties , including the average stellar mass , the average bs mass , the average bs lifetime , and the average binary semi - major axis . with the exception of the average stellar mass",
    ", there is no conclusive observational or theoretical evidence to indicate that these parameters should differ from cluster - to - cluster , although we can not rule out this possibility .",
    "for instance , the distribution of binary orbital parameters could depend on cluster properties like the total mass , density or velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , the central velocity dispersion should be higher in more massive gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which should correspond to a smaller binary orbital separation for the hard - soft boundary .",
    "this could contribute to massive gcs tending to have smaller average binary orbital separations since soft binaries should not survive for long in the dense cores of gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in turn , this could affect the occurrence of mass - transfer events , or of mergers during 1 + 2 and 2 + 2 encounters .",
    "this last point follows from the fact that numerical scattering experiments have shown that the probability of mergers occurring during 1 + 2 and 2 + 2 interactions increases with decreasing binary orbital separation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "both the average stellar mass and the average bs mass ( and hence lifetime ) could also depend on the total cluster mass , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also neglected to consider the importance of triples for bs formation throughout our analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since we are unaware of any observations of triples in gcs in the literature .",
    "interestingly , however , our results for binary star evolution can be generalized to include the internal evolution of triples since they should have the same functional dependence on the core mass ( i.e. n@xmath107 , where n@xmath108 is the number of bss formed from triple star evolution and f@xmath109 is the fraction of objects that are triples ) .",
    "finally , our model assumes that several parameters remain constant as a function of the distance from the cluster centre , including the binary fraction and the average semi - major axis .",
    "however , observations of gcs suggest that their binary fractions could fall off rapidly outside the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that , if the binary fraction is negligible outside the core , then the contribution from bss that migrate into the core due to dynamical friction is also negligible .",
    "this is because the time between 1 + 1 collisions increases rapidly outside the core , and every other bs formation mechanism requires binary stars to operate . on the other hand ,",
    "the presently observed binary fraction outside the core could be low as a result of binaries having previously migrated into the core due to dynamical friction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if these are the binary star progenitors of the bss currently populating the core , then dynamical friction remains an important effect in determining the number of bss currently populating the core .    despite all of these simplifying assumptions",
    ", we have shown that our model can reproduce the observations with remarkable accuracy .",
    "notwithstanding , the effects we have discussed could be contributing to cluster - to - cluster differences in the observed bs numbers .",
    "our model provides a well - suited resource for addressing the role played by these effects , however future observations will be needed in order to obtain the desired constraints ( e.g. binary fractions , distributions of binary orbital parameters , etc . ) .",
    "we would like to thank ata sarajedini , aaron dotter and roger cohen for providing the observations to which we compared our model predictions , as well as for providing a great deal of guidance in analyzing the data .",
