    "the imaging of bone structures is usually done using x - ray or computed tomography ( ct ) . however , ionizing radiation , scanner time cost , and lack of portability are the limitations of these modalities",
    ".  ultrasound may address these issues in many applications .",
    "ultrasound imaging of bone tissue has been investigated in different clinical procedures , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  registration of bone in neurosurgeries and orthopedics  @xcite , guidance for diagnosis of skeletal fractures in emergency rooms  @xcite , and pain management interventions  @xcite .  particularly , in some applications , dealing with the spine is of interest , _",
    "guidance for minimal invasive ( mi ) procedures in spinal surgery  @xcite , and for administration of spinal anesthesia  @xcite .",
    "+ ultrasound imaging is a valuable modality for enhancing the safety of different puncture techniques in regional anesthesia  @xcite .",
    "these procedures are mostly performed landmark based or blind  @xcite .",
    "ultrasound can facilitate these routines by visualizing the spinal anatomy , assisting to locate the puncture region before performing the injection procedure .",
    "further , ultrasound can be used as a real - time modality for needle trajectory control , or more effective placement of medication  @xcite . however , in epidural injections , the spinal structures obstruct the ultrasound beams and makes the images noisy . +",
    "another potential application of ultrasound is computer - assisted minimally invasive ( mi ) spinal surgery  @xcite .",
    "the procedure may require the registration of the patient positioned for surgery with preoperatively acquired images .",
    "the restriction of minimal invasiveness , together with limited radiation exposure , point at ultrasound imaging as a good candidate  @xcite .",
    "the other important procedure in mi spine surgery is the accurate localization of the target vertebra .",
    "conventionally , localizing a vertebral level is performed by manual palpation and direct fluoroscopy .",
    "thus , surgeons identify a specific anatomical landmark such as the sacrum , and , then , start counting under fluoroscopic control up to the targeted vertebral level  @xcite .",
    "this approach exposes the patient to an undesirable level of radiation , and is prone to counting errors due to the similar appearance of vertebrae in projection images  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ultrasound can improve patient safety and decrease the risk of wrong level surgery  @xcite .",
    "+ in general , bone imaging using conventional ultrasound techniques is prone to higher level of artifacts in comparison with soft tissue imaging  @xcite . in the case of the spine",
    ", images are filled with acoustical noise , and artifacts that can impede visualization of important features , and also make it hard to detect and segment the bone structure .",
    "image enhancement , where bone structures stand out more distinctly from surrounding soft tissue , helps to isolate the bone surface out of the b - mode ultrasound .",
    "+ to automate segmentation of the bone structure , image intensity or gradient - based methods are common  @xcite , but results are sensitive to the parameters of image acquisition , e.g.  frequency and dynamic range . pattern recognition or statistical shape models provide more robust results but require learning sets , and fail to identify traumatic cases as the pattern searched for is disrupted  @xcite .",
    "+ the visual interpretation of images is strongly related to the phase of the underlying signal  @xcite . such that the image features ( e.g.  edges , corners , etc . )",
    "occur at parts of the image where the fourier components are maximally in phase with one another  @xcite . based on local phase information ,",
    "a research group  @xcite has presented a robust method for bone surface detection .",
    "they use 2-d log - gabor filters to derive the phase symmetry ( ps ) measure a ridge detector for bone localization and automatic segmentation of bone surfaces in ultrasound images .",
    "this technique detects the major axis of symmetry of the signals , and its performance may degrade with the performance of the reconstruction method .",
    "+ in standard medical ultrasound the images are reconstructed based on the das beamforming technique . in this technique received signals from active channels are dynamically delayed and summed in the beamformer . in this case , the achievable resolution , sidelobes level and contrast are limited . instead , using an adaptive method , such as minimum variance ( mv ) based beamforming techniques , can enhance the image quality as a result of lower sidelobes , a narrower beamwidth , and superior definition of edges  @xcite . in the mv approach , for each time sample , the delayed received signal from each element is weighted adaptively before summing up in the beamformer .",
    "this approach was initially developed by capon for passive narrow - band applications  @xcite .",
    "+ several researchers have previously investigated the mv approach in medical ultrasound .",
    "they have reported appreciable enhancements in the resolution and contrast in comparison with das beamforming  @xcite .",
    "further , in a simulation study  @xcite an eigenspace - based mv ( esmv ) technique has been employed in order to improve the contrast of the mv beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging .",
    "this technique has been developed based on earlier studies in radar imaging  @xcite .",
    "previous work by our group  @xcite has demonstrated that in bone imaging scenarios , the robustness of the mv beamformer degrades due to a poor estimation of the covariance matrix .",
    "the forward backward ( fb ) averaging technique has been proposed in order to enhance the covariance matrix estimation against signal misalignment due to the shadowing  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have investigated the potential of an esmv beamforming technique to enhance the edges of the acoustically hard tissues  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that by reducing the signal subspace rank the bone edges are improved  @xcite . since the rank estimation is a challenge in esmv beamformers , in this study",
    "we show that the use of a rank one signal subspace can reasonably well preserve the vertebra anatomy and enhance the bone edges in spinal imaging .",
    "the constructed images may be less appealing from a visual perspective , but the goal here is to achieve advantages for post - processing methods such as phase symmetry . in simulation , in - vitro , and in - vivo studies , we demonstrate that the extracted surfaces from the rank-1 esmv images are sharper , and the anatomy of the spine is better defined in comparison with their corresponding das images .",
    "+ the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we first review the beamformer techniques , and the phase symmetry ridge detection method that are employed in this study ; then , simulation and experimental setups are introduced .",
    "we present the results from simulated data of a point scatterer and vertebra phantoms , followed by results from ct - us registration of a vertebra phantom , and in - vivo images of the spine .",
    "this section is followed by the discussion on the results .",
    "the minimum variance beamformer employs an element weight vector which minimizes the variance of the beamformer output under the constraint that the signal arriving from a point of interest is unaffected by the beamformer . in this method , the optimized weights are estimated as :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the spatial covariance matrix , @xmath3 is the steering vector , and @xmath4 stands for hermitian transpose .",
    "a common estimator for the data covariance matrix is the sample covariance matrix .",

    "can be combined with forward - backward averaging to improve the covariance matrix estimation  @xcite .",
    "the new estimate is expressed as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an exchange matrix , the left / right flipped version of the identity matrix , with the same dimension as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath15 . substituting @xmath17 with either @xmath18 or @xmath19 in ( [ eq : eq1 ] )",

    "also , in order to enhance the robustness of the mv estimate a term , @xmath22 , is added to the diagonal of the covariance matrix before evaluating ( [ eq : eq1 ] )  @xcite .",
    "there are many details about mv beamforming algorithms applied to medical ultrasound imaging , which have been addressed in previous publications  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the method that is described in  @xcite .",

    "this will result in a weight vector as  @xcite :    @xmath32    equation  [ eq : eq7 ] can be interpreted as the projection of @xmath21 on the signal subspace of @xmath18  @xcite .",
