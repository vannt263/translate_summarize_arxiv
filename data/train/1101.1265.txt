    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies are a class of agn characterized by a rather narrow width of the h@xmath3 emission line ( fwhm @xmath4 2000 km / s ) , and by the presence of a strong feii bump , a soft x - ray excess and flux ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath53 @xcite . these sources are usually radio - quiet , although , in a few cases , they show a radio - loudness parameter r ( ratio between the 5 ghz and optical b flux densities , @xcite ) greater than 1000 @xcite .",
    "such sources , dubbed radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( rl - nls1 ) , were thought to be inactive in @xmath0-rays , although several authors speculated the occurrence of similarities with blazars @xcite .",
    "the important discovery of @xmath0-ray emission from the rl - nls1 source pmn j0948 + 0022 @xcite confirmed these similarities , i.e. the presence of a jet closely aligned to the line of sight as a source of compton up - scattered @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "pmn j0948 + 0022 ( @xmath6=0.585 , @xcite ) is one of the strongest radio source among the rl - nls1 ; for its fast radio variability , source compactness , inverted radio spectrum and high brightness temperature , pmn j0948 + 0022 is one of the first rl - nls1 for which the presence of a jet has been hypothesized @xcite .",
    "the detection of @xmath0-ray emission definitively confirms the presence of a jet and allows to build a complete sed which closely resemble that of a typical blazar , with two broad peaks in the far ir and in the @xmath0-ray range respectively . by modeling the sed with the synchrotron and inverse - compton model",
    "@xcite it is possible to roughly estimate important parameters such as the black hole mass , the eddington ratio , and the power carried by the jet .",
    "the resulting values , although model - dependent , are usually compatible with estimates found independently in other studies . in the case of pmn j0948 + 0022 the black hole mass turns out to be @xmath71.5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 ( compatible with the range of values found by @xcite using the empirical relation between the fwhm of emission lines and the continuum luminosity ) , and the eddington ratio which is @xmath1140% . a @xmath0-ray variability of a factor 2.2 rules out the possibility that the @xmath0-ray emission is due to a starburst contribution @xcite .",
    "shortly after this discovery , three more rl - nls1 had been observed in @xmath0-rays @xcite : 1h 0323 + 342 , pks 1502 + 036 and pks 2004 - 447 , thus confirming that at least some rl - nls1 are @xmath0-ray emitting agn .",
    "the sed of these sources has also been modeled with the synchrotron and inverse - compton model , providing black hole mass estimates in agreement with previous studies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "1h 0323 + 342 ( @xmath6=0.06 , @xcite ) is considered to be a composite nucleus of a nls1 ( for its optical spectrum properties typical of nls1 ) and a blazar ( for its flat radio spectrum , core compactness and x - rays variability , @xcite ) .",
    "it is the only @xmath0-ray detected rl - nls1 for which we have an _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 optical image of the host galaxy .",
    "the host shows a ring - like structure of 15.6 kpc in diameter and the entire galaxy looks like a one - armed spiral @xcite .",
    "another study , based on not data , suggests that 1h 0323 + 342 may be the remnant of a galaxy merger @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of this source is the high luminosity of the accretion disc which , according to sed modeling , is approximately 90% of eddington value @xcite .",
    "pks 1502 + 036 ( @xmath6=0.41 , @xcite ) is the second most powerful source in terms of eddington ratio ( 80 per cent ) .",
    "it carries a jet power , inferred from sed modeling , sligthly lower than pmn j0948 + 002 @xcite .",
    "finally , pks 2004 - 447 ( @xmath6=0.24 , @xcite ) is an unusual rl - nls1 .",
    "it is a strong radio emitter , with the highest radio - loudness parameter ( r@xmath126000 ) among the four @xmath0-ray detected rl - nls1 .",
    "pks 2004 - 447 has an unusually weak fe ii complex compared to other nls1 and a rather steep ( although variable ) radio spectral index compared to the other rl - nls1 .",
    "@xcite suggests that it may be well classified as a low - luminosity compact steep spectrum ( css ) radio quasar , also considering its low inferred black hole mass ( @xmath1110@xmath13 m@xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "spectral fit of the sed may require a thermal comptonization component @xcite or an external compton component @xcite .    the detection of @xmath0-rays from the four mentioned rl - nls1 allows to identify a new class of @xmath0-ray emitting agn .",
    "the radio properties ( namely temporal variability , flat spectrum and high brightness temperature ) together with the @xmath0-ray detection suggests the presence of a relativistic jet closely aligned to the line of sight .",
    "low power , mildly relativistic and poorly collimated radio jets have already been observed in a few spiral galaxies hosting seyfert nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but in the case of pmn j0948 + 0022 and pks 1502 + 036 the power carried by the jet , as inferred from sed modeling , is in the range of quasars , while in 1h 0323 + 342 and pks 2004 - 447 is in the range of bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "such powerful jets are observed only in blazars hosted in elliptical galaxies @xcite with black hole masses in the range 10@xmath9 -",
    "10@xmath14 m@xmath10 .",
    "by contrast black hole masses in @xmath0-ray detected rl - nls1 ( 10@xmath13 - 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 ) are up to three orders of magnitude smaller than for blazars , thus suggesting that these sources emit at high eddington ratios .",
    "furthermore , it seems that the m@xmath15-@xmath16 scaling relation does not apply to nls1 , mainly due to their small fwhm of permitted lines .",
    "@xcite showed that a reconciliation with the scaling relation is possible if the broad line region is assumed to have a disc - like geometry ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "while the @xmath0-ray variability of pmn j0948 + 0022 has already been studied in @xcite and , with a higher level of significance , during the outburst occurred in july 2010 @xcite , it has never been studied for the remaining three sources .",
    "aim of this paper is to analyze the _",
    "fermi_/lat light curves of the afore - mentioned rl - nls1 galaxies in order to put the @xmath0-ray variability on a firm basis , and to find the minimum @xmath0-ray variability timescale . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a @xmath17cdm cosmology with h@xmath18 = 71 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 = 0.27 , @xmath21 = 0.73 .",
    "the data analysis has been performed following the standard procedure described in the _",
    "fermi_/lat documentation .",
    "the science tools software version is 9.15.2 and the irf is ` p6_v3_diffuse ` .",
    "data span the period from 2008 august 4 to 2010 october 08 ( @xmath1126 months ) . for each rl - nls1 all class 3 ( diffuse ) events coming from a zenith angle @xmath22 were extracted within an acceptance cone of radius 10@xmath23 around the catalog source position .",
    "the unbinned likelihood analysis has been performed modeling the spectrum of each rl - nls1 and of all nearby ( @xmath24 ) sources present in the lat 1-year point source catalog @xcite with a power law in the range 0.1  100 gev .",
    "we computed the integrated flux for each source analyzing all data over the entire period of 26 months .",
    "the extension of the region of interest to @xmath25 around the catalog position results in non - significant variations of the flux , number of counts and ts ( test statistic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as expected since the psf of lat is at most @xmath26 wide at 100 mev .",
    "we also performed the same analysis using alternative spectral models .",
    "the use of a broken power law instead of a simple power law model yields to a slight increase in the values of ts for pmn j0948 + 0022 ( from 993 to 1194 ) and 1h 0323 + 342 ( from 86 to 115 ) , and a decrease for pks 1502 + 036 and pks 2004 - 447 . with a log - parabola , the values of ts remain essentially the same as for the case of a power law for pmn j0948 + 0022 ( from 993 to 999 ) and pks 2004 - 447 ( from 97.4 to 98.5 ) , while they decrease for 1h 0323 + 342 and pks 1502 + 036 . in the following analysis",
    "we will therefore use the power law models .",
    "then we extracted light curves with time binning of 15 days ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lightcurve ] ; the time binning for pks 2004 - 447 is 30 days ) using a ts threshold of 10 ( ts@xmath1210 , roughly equivalent to 3@xmath27 , @xcite ) and performed a chi - squared test against the null hypotesis of constant flux .",
    "+        if the detection was not significant ( ts@xmath2810 ) we computed an upper limit to the flux by varying the source flux value ( obtained through maximization of likelihood ) until ts reaches a value of 4 @xcite .",
    "the resulting fluxes ( denoted with arrows in the figure ) corresponds to 2@xmath27 upper limits . when ts@xmath281 we did nt compute the upper limit since it would be overestimated .",
    "we further proceeded on the analysis of the light curves in order to compute the minimum _ e_-folding timescale for each source .",
    "we extracted light curves with different time binnings starting from 30 days .",
    "when the detection is significant ( ts@xmath1210 ) we re - run the analysis halving the time bin interval , down to a minimum of approximately 6 hours ( roughly corresponding to four _ fermi _ orbits , thus ensuring that each source is observed at least twice for each temporal bin ) .",
    "then , we considered all combinations of non - overlapping time bins with the following characteristics : ( 1 ) both time bins have a significant detection , ts@xmath1210 ; ( 2 ) the flux difference is greater than the greatest flux error involved at the 3@xmath27 level ; ( 3 ) the count difference is significant at the 3@xmath27 level , assuming a poisson statistic ; ( 4 ) the number of counts in each bin must be greater than 3 . for such pairs of bins we computed the _",

    "the quantities involved in the calculation of @xmath43 ( time , time binning , photon flux , number of counts and ts values ) are reported in table [ tab - bins ] .",
    "a statistically significant variability over the entire period of 26 months is present for all sources .",
    "the significance of this variability on timescales of @xmath42 years is supported by the chi - squared test performed against the null hypotesis of constant flux ( last two columns of table [ tab - data ] ) .",

    "thus , the data support the hypotesis that @xmath0-ray photons are associated to the presence of a jet .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility of a starburst activity but its contribution would be negligible compared to the jet emission , since the @xmath0-ray luminosities ( table [ tab - data ] ) found in our rl - nls1 are at least four order of magnitude greater than the archetypal starburst galaxy m82 hosting a quiescent black hole @xcite and whose @xmath0-ray luminosity in the 0.1  100 gev range is @xmath1110@xmath47 erg s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the next step in our analysis has been to estimate the minimum timescale variability for each source . among the many methods to measure a timescale variability we chose the _ e_-folding timescale ( eq . [ eq - tau ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it allows a computation of the timescale using just two flux measurements ; it does not require any fitting or minimising procedure .",
    "furthermore the resulting timescale is well defined and can be used to compare different sources .",
    "finally , the error on the timescale is easily computed using analytical error propagation ( eq . [ eq - dtau ] ) .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the flux evolve according to an ( either increasing or decreasing ) exponential law .",
    "although this assumption is not always justified ( e.g. in the presence of flaring episodes ) it is of common practice since we often do not know the actual law which drives the evolution of the flux .",
    "furthermore , the requirement of just two flux measurements can be easily accomplished even for weak sources such as the ones analyzed in this work .",
    "the rules to select the flux measurements used in the computation of the _ e_-folding timescale have been described in sect .",
    "[ sec - dataanalysis ] : rules ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are needed to ensure that the flux in the two temporal bins are actually different , otherwise our assumption of exponentially varying flux can not be justified .",
    "rules ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) ensure that the flux measures and associated errors are reliable . the relative error @xmath48 of our measure of the minimum _",
    "e_-folding timescale depends on several factors .",
    "the main sources of uncertainties are the errors in the flux measurements @xmath49 and the width of the time bins @xmath50 . the ratio @xmath51 can be made smaller by increasing the number of counts detected in a wider time bin ( greater @xmath52 ) .",
    "viceversa , a narrower time bin results in a smaller number of counts and consequently a poor accuracy in the flux measurement .",
    "the best achievable accuracy on @xmath43 ( that is the smaller value of @xmath53 ) is thus determined by the trade - off between the narrowness of the time bin and the accuracy of flux measurements .",
    "notice however that the narrowness of the time bin is limited by the requirement that the source is detected with high significance , ts@xmath54 ( rule ( 1 ) in sect .",
    "[ sec - dataanalysis ] ) .",
    "since the shortest width of the time bins scales linearly with the inverse of the photon flux , we may use narrower time bins ( and detect shorter timescales ) on brighter sources .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath43 is improved if we compute the _ e_-folding timescale using non - contiguous time bins , since the exponential law is better constrained by distant points rather than closer ones . on the other hand , if the bins are contiguous , the error @xmath38 may be significantly greater than @xmath43 itself , i.e. the measure would be useless .",
    "the issue related to the computation of @xmath43 with non - contiguous time bins is that we are deliberately ignoring what lies between the two time bins , even if we have a significant measure .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_lightcurvezoom ] for pmn j0948 + 0022 ( upper - left panel ) where the minimum _ e_-folding timescale is computed ignoring the flux measurement at time @xmath11 706 ( mjd - 54682 ) .",
    "the reason is that the flux measure has a rather big error bar , which does not allow us to consider it statistically incompatible at the 3@xmath27 level with neighbouring flux measures ( rule ( 2 ) in sect .",
    "[ sec - dataanalysis ] ) .",
    "this example suggests that the intrinsic variability timescale , i.e. a measure of `` how fast '' the source is able to change its flux significantly , may be shorter than our measure of @xmath43 , although we can not assess it on a firm statistical basis .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that we are assuming a particular function ( the exponential ) and that we are using only two flux measurements instead of all available data .",
    "if our detector were able to monitor the flux evolution continuously , we could have employed more sophisticated methods , such as the fourier analysis , in order to estimate the intrinsic minimum timescale variability .",
    "actually , our light curves do not allow a continuous monitoring of the sources with time binning of 30 days , and we are thus forced to rely on the _ e_-folding timescale . as a consequence , our measure of @xmath43 should be considered as an upper limit for the intrinsic minimum timescale variability .",
    "the sources display an _ e_-folding minimum timescale variability in the range of 3  30 days .",
    "in particular , variability of the order of @xmath11days has been found for pmn j0948 + 0022 , and of the order of @xmath11tens of days for 1h 0323 + 342 , pks 1502 + 036 and pks 2004 - 447 .",
    "the minimum measured variability timescales in blazars can be as low as 200 seconds at very high energies ( e@xmath12200 gev ) and 800 seconds at x - rays ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at _",
    "fermi_/lat energies variability on scales of few hours has been detected in several blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the bright blazars 3c 454.3 and pks 1510 - 089 showed variability on scales of 36 hours with flux @xmath1110@xmath55 ph @xmath56 s@xmath19 @xcite , that is 1  2 orders of magnitude greater than the flux of the sources analyzed here . as discussed above , we expect to measure longer timescales on weaker sources , as a consequence of the longer time integration required to significantly detect the source .",
    "our minimum timescale estimates are indeed approximately 1  2 orders of magnitude longer compared to those of the above - mentioned blazars .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude the possibility that variability in rl - nls1 is as fast as the one observed in some of the most luminous blazars .",
    "the detection of shorter timescales on our sources is challenging due to their weakness .",
    "ground - based cherenkov telescopes may be more suited to search for shorter timescale variabilities , if the spectrum of rl - nls1 extend to very high energies . in principle variability",
    "can also be measured using the flux upper limits and the resulting minimum timescales would be below the results quoted in table [ tab - data ] ( i.e. for pmn j0948 + 0022 we would obtain @xmath57 day ) . upper limit of fluxes",
    "are however less reliable than direct flux measurement , since they depends on the contribution of nearby sources and of diffuse background .",
    "the minimum _ e_-folding timescale variability allow to estimate an upper limit for the size of the emitting region : @xmath580.5  6 @xmath59 10@xmath60 cm , where @xmath61 is the relativistic doppler factor and @xmath6 is the redshift . with a jet aperture @xmath62 rad the distance at which most of the kinetic energy of the jet is dissipated and the @xmath0-rays observed are produced ( the so - called dissipation region ) , is @xmath63 0.2  2 @xmath64 pc .",
    "the photon indices are rather steep ( @xmath65 , with the only exception of the point at time @xmath1175 of pks 2004 - 447 ) , thus the inverse compton peak lies below 100 mev . in the framework of the blazar sequence @xcite the @xmath0-ray emitting rl - nls1 are therefore located in the region relevant to quasars .",
    "the photon index shows also some significant variations , e.g. at time @xmath11750 ( mjd - 54682 ) the photon index of 1h 0323 + 342 underwent a 6@xmath27 variation from @xmath66 = - ( 2.46 @xmath67 ) to @xmath66 = - ( 3.2 @xmath44 0.1 ) in 15 days ( ts = 15 and 24 , counts = 43 and 74 respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding photon flux is larger when the spectrum is steeper , so that the overall @xmath0-ray luminosity does not change significantly .",
    "another striking case is given at time @xmath11550 ( mjd - 54682 ) of pks 1502 + 036 for which the photon index shows a 16@xmath27 variation from @xmath66 = -(1.97 @xmath44 0.06 ) to @xmath66 = -(4.7 @xmath44 0.2 ) in 15 days , although the ts values are much lower ( 10 and 11 respectively ) .",
    "also in this case the overall @xmath0-ray luminosity does not change significantly .",
    "this behaviour is in contradiction with the harder - when - brigther phenomenon observed in the x - ray spectra of several hbl @xcite and at @xmath0-ray energies of pmn j0948 + 0022 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is usually ascribed to the upshift of the inverse - compton peak as the source brightens .",
    "the weakness of the sources prevents us from building a time - resolved detailed spectra and from drawing any conclusion about the eventual shift towards lower energies of the inverse - compton peak in 1h 0323 + 342 and pks 1502 + 036 .",
    "in this work , we report the discovery of a statistically significant variability in the @xmath0-ray light curves of the four rl - nls1 detected with _ fermi_/lat , with minimum variability timescales in the range 3  30 days .",
    "this excludes a potential starburst origin of the @xmath0-ray emission , and supports the hypothesis of the presence of a jet closely aligned to the line of sight .",
    "a hint for photon index variations on timescales @xmath11tens of days is also found in the data .",
    "variability appears to be a feature common to the four first @xmath0-ray detected rl - nls1 .",
