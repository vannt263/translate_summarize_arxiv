    "disks orbiting young stars ( 1 - 10 myr ) are sources of accreting material and sites of nascent planetary systems .",
    "observations that can establish the physical conditions and evolution of the gaseous component within young circumstellar disks are essential if we are to understand the magnetospheric accretion processes that determines a star s zero age main sequence mass , protoplanetary disk structure and evolution , and the processes involved in planet formation . despite their relevance to all of these important open issues , the physical and chemical properties of gaseous circumstellar disks are still poorly understood .",
    "submillimeter observations of molecular lines provide insight into the chemistry and the physics of the outer disk regions ( r@xmath3100 au ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the properties of the gas within 20 - 30 au have been only recently investigated thanks to the mid - infrared irs spectrograph on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope , e.g. , by the discovery of emission lines from several species including organic molecules and water @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting mid - infrared spectral features is the [ ] line at 12.81 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the importance of the [ ] line is twofold : it traces warm gas ( t@xmath15000 k ) and , due to the high first ionization potential of neon ( 21.56 ev ) , it is a good proxy for the influence of stellar extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and x - ray radiation on the disk .",
    "the presence of strong [ ] emission at 12.81 @xmath0 m from protoplanetary disks was first predicted by @xcite , who suggested that neon is ionized by k - shell absorption of x - ray photons at energy e@xmath30.9 kev .",
    "this hypothesis has been refined by sophisticated irradiated - disk models @xcite , which predict a correlation between the stellar x - ray luminosity and the total [ ] line luminosity .",
    "it has also been suggested that x - rays may determine disk dissipation by heating the circumstellar gas to temperatures t@xmath4 k and triggering its photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "neon ionization and disk photoevaporation could also be induced by euv photons produced by accretion shocks @xcite .",
    "however , euv photons are more easily absorbed by neutral hydrogen , so they are less likely than x - rays to reach and affect the circumstellar disk , especially early in the class ii phase when inflow and outflow from the inner disk are densest @xcite .    a detailed comparison between models and observations is required to clarify this complex theoretical scenario .",
    "several surveys of the [ ] emission from young stellar objects ( ysos ) have been carried out in the last 5 years , using low spectral and spatial resolution data obtained with _",
    "spitzer_/irs @xcite . a weak correlation between x - ray and [ ]",
    "luminosity has been found by @xcite , who investigated a sample consisting of 92 pre - main sequence stars .",
    "furthermore , [ ] emission was found to be stronger in class i ysos and in sources driving protostellar jets than in more evolved ysos @xcite .",
    "the strong [ ] emission observed in embedded ysos driving jets  orders of magnitude larger than predicted by models of emission from disks  is unlikely produced by irradiated gas within the inner disk , but it may be produced either by shocks , in the circumstellar envelope or in protostellar jets @xcite , or in the launching region of magnetically driven outflows irradiated by stellar x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer_/irs data , with their limited spectral and spatial resolution , provide limited information on the velocity and the spatial structure of the emitting gas .",
    "high spectral and spatial resolution observations of the [ ] line from the ground can be used to decouple disk and jet emission .",
    "for example , using vlt / visir , clear evidence of [ ] emission from protostellar jets has been discovered in the triple system t tau @xcite .",
    "the observations show that the predominant [ ] emission component is shifted to a velocity compatible with the jet motion and is extended ( @xmath5 ) along the jet direction .",
    "however , a disk origin for the [ ] emission has been suggested by high spectral resolution observations of the nearby classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) tw hya @xcite , aa tau and gm tau @xcite . in all of these stars",
    "the line appeared broadened ( @xmath6 ) and centered near the stellar velocity .",
    "the absence of detectable blue - shift suggested that the emission is produced from a static disk atmosphere , but given the low signal - to - noise ratio of this data , it was not possible to rule out the presence of emission from a slow ( @xmath7 ) photoevaporative wind .",
    "evidence of [ ] emission arising from both a protostellar jet and a photoevaporative disk wind has been found by @xcite , who observed 4 optically thick disk objects ( sz 73 , sz 102 , hd 3700a , vw cha ) and 3 transition disk objects ( tw hydrae , t cha and cs cha ) .",
    "transition disk objects have no excess in the near infrared and a strong excess in the far infrared , which is interpreted as a signature of a few au central gap within the disk ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite detected [ ] emission from all the transition disk objects , finding the line slightly blue - shifted ( @xmath8 ) and broadened , with a line width correlated with inclination angle .",
    "these characteristics appear consistent with model profiles expected from a photoevaporative disk wind triggered by euv or x - ray stellar emission @xcite , but a larger number of analogous observations are required to confirm their results .",
    "they detected the emission in only one of the optically thick disk objects , sz 73 .",
    "since the emission is strongly blue - shifted ( @xmath9 ) and broadened ( @xmath10 ) , an origin from fast outflowing material is more likely than a disk origin .",
    "additional evidence for a photoevaporative wind comes from the asymmetric [ ] line profile detected toward the transition disk around tw hydrae @xcite .    with the aim of understanding the origin of the [ ] emission from stars at various evolutionary stages and with different circumstellar characteristics and to test x - ray and euv irradiated disk models with observations , we performed a high resolution spectroscopic survey of the [ ] emission from 32 t tauri stars and ysos spanning a range of spectral energy distributions ( sed ) , with the visir spectrograph at the vlt . here ,",
    "we present the results of this survey , including a comparison with _ spitzer_/irs spectra , some of which are published here for the first time . in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we describe the observed sample , the observations and the data reduction reduction procedure ; in sect . [ sec : results ] we report the results of analysis of the visir and the _ spitzer _ data ; in sect .",
    "4 , we discuss our results and compare them with the predictions of irradiated disk models ; and in sect . 5 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we observed 32 t tauri stars and ysos ( 2 resolved binaries irs 43 and cra irs5 are counted as 4 ) , belonging to several star forming regions and young stellar associations . in subsection",
    "[ sect : sample ] , we describe the properties of the observed stars and the procedures used to observe them ; in subsection [ sect : data_red ] , we describe the data reduction process .",
    "all the stars in our sample , with the exception of iras 08267 - 3336 , are closer than 150 pc .",
    "we include stars from both very young star forming regions such as @xmath11 oph and corona australis ( 1 - 3 myr ) , which are characterized by a large number of deeply embedded protostellar objects , and older stellar associations like @xmath12 cha and @xmath13 pictoris ( 6 - 12 myr ) , that are mainly composed of apparently diskless ( class iii ) stars .",
    "we consider different regions and associations to include in our sample ysos of different infrared classes .",
    "furthermore , we gave higher priority to ysos with _",
    "detections of the [ ] emission at 12.81 @xmath0 m . two objects ( t cha and sz 73 )  whose [ ] line was already detected with vlt / visir by @xcite  have been observed again to investigate the variability of the emission .",
    "the full list of the observed targets is reported in table [ obs - target ] , where we list object coordinates from the 2mass catalog @xcite , parent region , distance ( based on the parent region and data reported in the literature ) , heliocentric radial velocities , infrared class , disk inclination , x - ray luminosity in the band 0.3 - 10.0 kev values are for slightly different bands and were corrected to account for the band differences . ] and mass accretion rate .",
    "all data in table [ obs - target ] are retrieved from the literature .",
    "radial velocities for some of the stars in the @xmath11 oph and corona australis star forming regions were not available in the literature , so these radial velocities have been estimated from the velocity of the parent cloud or nearby stars ( see table [ obs - target ] for further details ) .",
    "disk inclinations reported in table [ obs - target ] are derived by different techniques .",
    "specifically , in 8 ysos , disk inclinations are derived from interferometric submillimeter observations or scattered - light imaging of the disk ( with estimated uncertainties 5 - 10 degrees ) . for ru lupi we assumed the disk inclination to be equal to the inclination of the stellar rotation axes ( error @xmath110 degrees ) , and for t cha and rx j1615.3 - 3255 we report the inclination derived from a fit of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "errors on the inclination derived from the sed are probably much higher .",
    "however , in the case of t cha ( inclination angle 75 degrees ) other observational signatures ",
    "e.g. a highly variable optical extinction  demonstrate the presence of a circumstellar disk seen nearly edge - on .",
    "for all the remaining targets , no information on the disk inclinations are available in the literature .    the infrared class of our targets , reported in table [ obs - target ] , was derived from analyses reported in the literature (",
    "references are reported in the last column of table [ obs - target ] ) of the sed in the near - infrared and mid - infrared bands and , in three cases ( r cra-7b , cra irs 5 and t cra ) , of mid - infrared color - magnitude diagrams . specifically , we classified , as class i and class ii , sources with sed slopes in the ranges @xmath14 and -2 @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "to first approximation , the slope of the sed indicates the presence of a massive protostellar envelope ( in class i ) or an optically thick disk ( in class ii ) .",
    "however , recent detailed studies of the dust emission in the mid - infrared and submillimeter band ( see @xcite for a review ) suggest that within the class ii are included stars with an optically thick disk and stars harbouring a more evolved disk , characterized by the presence of an inner gap .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the origin of the [ ] emission in the latter group of stars is much different than in the former , therefore , following the definitions mostly used in the literature , we define two more classes of objects : the transition disks and the pre - transition disks .",
    "specifically , circumstellar disks with signatures of a large ( few au ) inner hole  i.e. no excess in the near infrared and large excess in the mid infrared  are classified as transition objects ( tr ) , while circumstellar disks , with a sed indicating the presence of a gap , which separates the inner disk from the outer disk are classified as pre - transition disks ( ptr , see @xcite for a detailed discussion about the difference between transition and pre - transition disks ) .    on the basis of these criteria , our sample",
    "is composed of 9 class i , 13 class ii , 6 transition disks , and 4 pre - transition disks .",
    "however , the information that we found in the literature for our sample were not homogeneous so , we can not exclude that with a more complete and homogeneous set of data some of the class ii objects may be classified as transition or pre - transition disks .",
    "it is worth noting that a large gap in the dusty component of the disk does not necessarily imply the presence of a gap in its gaseous component , where the [ ] emission is produced .",
    "for example , in our sample t cha , v4046 sgr and hen 3 - 600 are transition disk objects but they are also actively accreting , as strong optical emission lines demonstrate @xcite .",
    "the presence of these accretion signatures indicates that the hole within the dusty component of the disk is filled with gas .",
    "visir observations have been carried out during three different eso observing periods , p83 , p84 and p85 .",
    "we used visir @xcite in high resolution , long slit , spectroscopic mode .",
    "the echelle grating is centered on the [ ] fine structure line at 12.81355 @xmath0 m @xcite and covers the spectral range between 12.79 and 12.83 @xmath0 m .",
    "we set the slit width at 0.4@xmath16 ( @xmath140 au at a distance of @xmath1100 pc ) , which coincides with the spatial resolution of the instrument when the visual seeing is better than 0.6 - 0.7@xmath16 @xcite , and a spectral resolution r@xmath130,000 ( @xmath17 in velocity scale ) .",
    "the spectral and spatial resolutions of our observations are , therefore , 50 and 10 times higher than [ ] observations carried out using irs spectrograph on board _ spitzer _ , respectively ( r@xmath1600 and slit width @xmath18 ) . for flux calibration and telluric correction , we observed a standard star immediately before and/or after the observation of each target at airmass as close as possible to that of the target .",
    "the observation of stars requiring long exposure times have been split in more than one segment , alternating an observation of the target with an observation of the standard star .",
    "table [ obs - log ] reports date , time , airmass and exposure time of all the observed stars and their associated standard stars . during the first run",
    ", we also observed the asteroid kalliope to obtain a pure sky absorption spectrum , and titan to verify the instrument resolution .",
    "our titan spectrum has been analyzed by @xcite , who measured the fwhms and the centroid position of unresolved lines of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the measured fwhms span a very narrow range with a mean value of 10 @xmath2 , as expected considering the instrument resolution , while the uncertainties on the line centroids is @xmath11 @xmath2 .",
    "however , by tests on a set of standard stars and from tw hydrae data , @xcite found that the absolute accuracy of the line centroid is 2 @xmath2 due to uncertainties in placing the source in the center of the slit .",
    "we also compiled fluxes in the [ ] lines measured from _",
    "spitzer_/irs @xcite from the literature , and when these were not available , we downloaded , reduced and analyzed data from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "_ spitzer _ [ ] fluxes are reported in table [ tab : results ] , together with the results obtained from the visir observations , for a direct comparison .",
    "we reduced all vlt / visir data using the visir pipeline vers .",
    "3.2.2 @xcite in conjunction with our idl scripts .",
    "visir data are a collection of data cubes , each corresponding to a nod position .",
    "every data cube contains 2n+1 planes , where n is the number of the chopping cycles .",
    "odd planes contain the images from the on source chopping cycle ( @xmath21 ) , while the even planes contain the average of the differences between the current and all the previous on source ( @xmath21 ) and off source ( @xmath22 ) chopping cycle images .",
    "therefore , the last plane contains the average of all the @xmath23 images .",
    "the first part of the data reduction is executed by the pipeline .",
    "specifically , all the data cubes are coupled in pairs , composed of two complementary nod positions .",
    "the last planes of each pair are summed and divided by the total integration time . at this point , because we used standard observing mode , in which the chopping and nodding directions and throws are the same , each nodded image contains a double positive beam in the center and a negative beam on each side .",
    "to form the final science frame , all the nodded images are added , after bad pixel cleaning and correction of the image distortion . in a small number of cases , we excluded from the final sum some pairs of nod images taken when the background emission was particularly strong and variable , e.g. due to the presence of thin clouds .",
    "the standard deviation of the noise in the resulting image is calculated from the dispersion of pixel values , after the rejection of outliers with an iterative sigma - clipping .",
    "pixels with values less than 3 times the standard deviation of the noise are classified as noisy .",
    "the spectrum is extracted by the pipeline using the method developed by @xcite .",
    "specifically , a weight map is generated by collapsing the spectrum along the dispersion direction , normalizing the absolute flux of the one - dimensional image to 1 and setting to zero noisy pixels .",
    "the resulting profile is then replicated along the dispersion direction to cover the full frame .",
    "the final spectrum is obtained by multiplying the science frame for the weight map and summing along the slit direction .",
    "pixels classified as noisy are used to calculate errors ( see fig . [",
    "fig : data_red ] ) .",
    "after several tests , we realized that this method for spectrum extraction fails in two situations : a ) when the signal - to - noise ratio is very low and the residual noise is comparable to the signal from the star , because the weight map , and therefore the extracted spectrum , is significantly contaminated by noise ( see the the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : data_red ] ) ; b ) when we observe a spatially resolved binary with the two components aligned along the slit , because by multiplying the science frame for the weight map and summing along the slit direction we obtain an integrated spectrum of both components , losing information on the emission of each component . to avoid these problems ,",
    "we extracted the spectra of faint sources and resolved binary systems by defining our own weight map .",
    "the weight map for faint sources is the sum of three gaussians , one centered on the peaks of the positive beam and two centered on the negative beams , with half and opposite amplitudes with respect to the first one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : data_red ] ) . to extract separately the spectra of each component of the spatially resolved binaries , we defined different maps for each component , using the same method described above ( see bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : data_red ] ) to check this procedure , we applied this method to the bright stars of our sample ; obtaining the same results as with the standard procedure ( see top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : data_red ] ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration is done by cross - correlating an infrared background spectrum with a synthetic model spectrum of the atmosphere .",
    "the infrared background spectrum is extracted from the input files before correcting for chopping and nodding .",
    "the whole extraction procedure described above is performed in the same way for both the science target and the associated standard stars .",
    "finally , the flux calibrated spectrum is obtained by multiplying the observed spectrum of the star by a spectral response function .",
    "the response function is calculated by dividing the observed spectrum of a standard star by the flux model ( at very low resolution and not including photospheric absorption lines ) retrieved from the visir standard stars catalog .",
    "photospheric absorption lines in the spectra of the standard stars have been eliminated by gaussian fitting .",
    "this procedure allow us to correct both for sky transmission , which depends on the wavelength - because of telluric lines - and on the airmass , and for fringing , a flux modulation with the wavelength that is characteristic of vlt / visir spectra and that has been found to be constant over periods of several months @xcite .",
    "this procedure may not be very accurate if the signal - to - noise ratio of the standard is very low , if the airmass of the standard is different from the airmass of the target , or if the photospheric lines of the standard are not well subtracted , because they are blended with telluric lines . to verify that none of these sources of error affect our results , we derive our calibrated spectra using an alternative approach .",
    "specifically , we remove the fringing and the telluric lines using a fringing model and a model of the atmosphere and , then , we used the standard stars only for the flux calibration .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this alternative method is reported in @xcite .",
    "the two methods for deriving the calibrated spectra give the same results for all the stars except for t cra .",
    "in this case , the first procedure did not work very well because the airmass of the star and of the standard are different and because the equivalent width of the [ ] line is very low , so systematic errors associated with flux calibration turn out to be larger than statistical errors . on the basis of these considerations , for t cra we applied the second procedure for the flux calibration .    _",
    "spitzer_/irs data for stars observed in the c2d survey were reduced using the c2d data reduction pipeline ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details ) .",
    "data for other stars were downloaded from the spitzer heritage archive in the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) format processed with the s18.18.0 data pipeline .",
    "these data were analyzed using custom idl code ( including ssc software irsclean mask ) and the smart ( v.8.2.1 . ) program developed by the irs team at cornell university ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to further improve the flux calibration",
    ", we reduced 4 spectra of the standard star @xmath24 draconis using the same procedure as for the science targets and , then we recalibrated the observed flux ( the median among the 4 spectra ) by using the median of these spectra and a model spectrum , that has been produced by marcs code with the specific purpose of calibrating _ spitzer _ spectra @xcite .",
    "we observed 32 ysos .",
    "our targets belong to the star forming regions taurus , @xmath11 oph , corona australis , lupus and the gum nebula and to the nearby associations tw hya , @xmath12 cha and @xmath13 pic .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "fluxes , full widths at half maximum ( fwhms ) and peak velocities ( v@xmath25 ) of the emission lines are calculated by fitting the spectral lines with the sum of a gaussian and a constant continuum ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) . errors ( 1@xmath26 ) in the total flux and fwhm are derived by a best fit procedure .",
    "systematic errors associated with photometric calibration will be discussed later in this section .",
    "errors on line peak velocities are the sum , in quadrature , of the statistical errors associated with the fitting procedure , the error on the stellar velocity reported in table [ obs - target ] , and an additional error of 2 @xmath2 that accounts for errors in positioning the star within the slit ( see @xcite and sect .",
    "[ sect : sample ] ) . if in the observed wavelength range there are no significant emission features , we assume that the line has not been detected and we report the upper limit in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "the upper limit depends on the assumed line width and was computed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the standard deviation of the continuum emission , fwhm is the assumed full width at half maximum of the line and @xmath29v is the width of a velocity bin ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "upper limits reported in table [ tab : results ] are calculated for an assumed fwhm=20 @xmath2 .",
    "four spectra of stars , for which [ ] was not detected are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : no_det ] overplotted with a gaussian with a total flux equal to the upper limit and a fwhm=20 @xmath2 .",
    "we chose to plot and report the upper limit for an assumed fwhm=20 @xmath2 , because it is the typical fwhm of the observed emission line produced by photoevaporative winds ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : inner_disk ] ) .    even if standard stars were observed just after or before the science targets and",
    "were chosen as close as possible to the targets , a residual systematic error due to discrepancy between the airmass of the standard and of the target could affect our results .",
    "@xcite studied the systematic errors on visir observations of the [ ] emission by observing tw hya several times during the same night . in their observations",
    "both flux and line peak velocity depended on the airmass .",
    "specifically , the flux decreased of up a factor 2 as the airmass increased from 1 to 1.4 , while the peak velocity varied from -4 to -7 @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that the observed fwhm of the line did not depend on the airmass .",
    "all the detected lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] with best - fit gaussians overlaid on the data .",
    "all lines are well fitted by a gaussian , except ru lupi and irs 43 . specifically , the emission of ru lupi looks asymmetric , with the line peak blue - shifted with respect to the line center ; while in the spectra of both irs 43 n and irs 43 s we observe two features , a stronger one , which peaks very close to the stellar radial velocity and is well fitted by a gaussian profile , and a weaker one , which is strongly blue - shifted ( @xmath31 ) and asymmetric .",
    "however , this strongly blue - shifted component is very weak and we are not sure if it is a real feature or a statistical fluctuation .",
    "two of our targets ( sz 73 and t cha ) have been previously observed by @xcite , using visir . to test our data reduction procedure and to compare our observations with the previous ones",
    ", we rereduced again the data obtained by @xcite , using our version of the pipeline .",
    "we obtained slightly higher fluxes in both cases ; these are the values reported in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "the new version of the pipeline performs a better subtraction of the sky that can influence the observed flux of very faint targets like t cha and sz 73 .",
    "however , these discrepancies are not significant , so they do not influence the scientific results of either ours or previous analysis .",
    "the two datasets for t cha and sz 73 also offer an opportunity to investigate variability of the [ ] line . in the case of t",
    "cha the line flux , shape and fwhm remained the same . on the contrary , in sz 73 we failed to detect the [ ] from the outflow as previously reported in @xcite .",
    "the second epoch data show upper limits of a factor 1.6 lower than the epoch one data ( see table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "because emission from sz 73 is due to a protostellar jet , different slit orientations , different seeing or different positions of the star within the slit could produce significant discrepancies in the measured line flux .",
    "we can rule out the first two hypotheses , because in the two observations the slit orientation on the plane of the sky was the same and the seeing was slightly better during the second observation when the line was not detected .",
    "errors in centering the star within the slit or intrinsic variability could explain the discrepancy between the results of the two observations .    in table [",
    "tab : results ] , we also report line luminosities ( or their upper limits ) , calculated from the distances reported in table [ obs - target ] .",
    "we also consider the effect of the absorption from interstellar and circumstellar gas , which , at 12.81 @xmath0 m , is not negligible for highly embedded sources , i.e when the absorption in the j band is a@xmath32 mag @xcite .",
    "specifically , we obtained a@xmath33 ( see table [ tab : results ] ) from the literature and , when it was not available , from measurement of optical extinction , using the conversion law @xmath34 @xcite , or from the absorption in the x - ray band ( @xmath35 ) , using the conversion law @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the absorption a@xmath33 is larger than 1 mag in 13 ysos in @xmath11 ophiuchi , 3 sources in the corona australis and , only marginally ( a@xmath37 mag ) in iras 08267 - 3336 .",
    "@xcite showed that for highly absorbed stars in @xmath11 oph and other star forming region an extinction law with @xmath38 is appropriate , as it accounts for grain growth in the dense part of the cloud .",
    "therefore , for sources with @xmath39 , we calculate the absorption at 12 @xmath0 m , using the relation @xmath40 from @xcite , resulting in an absorption @xmath41 ranging from 0.22 to 4.16 mag . for all other sources ,",
    "we used the standard @xmath42 extinction law ( @xmath43 from @xcite ) .",

    "different emission mechanisms have been discussed in the literature . the [ ]",
    "emission could be a tracer of shocks produced by the interaction between a protostellar outflow and the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been suggested to be at the origin of the emission observed from the triple system t tau @xcite .",
    "the main observational evidence supporting this hypothesis is the spatial location of the emission : in fact , the emission is extended ( 1.1@xmath16 ) and located along the stellar outflow .",
    "otherwise , the neon could be ionized by high energy stellar emission . in this scenario",
    "the [ ] emission at 12.81 @xmath0 m should be produced within the inner circumstellar disk , few au from the central star .",
    "a handful of observations of transition disks support this second scenario by showing that the emission is usually compact and at a velocity close to that of the radial velocity of the central star @xcite .",
    "information on the spatial distribution of the [ ] emission can be obtained by comparing fluxes measured by _ spitzer _",
    "( spatial resolution @xmath14.7@xmath16 ) and visir ( spatial resolution @xmath10.4@xmath16 ) . to illustrate this , we show in figure [ fig : visir_vs_spitzer ] the ratio between the absorbed flux observed using _",
    "spitzer _ and visir as function of the [ ] absorption - corrected luminosity measured from the visir spectra for ysos of various infrared class .",
    "a systematic discrepancy is evident between the [ ] fluxes measured by _",
    "spitzer _ and visir for class i ysos ( blue dots ) ; namely , _ spitzer _",
    "fluxes range from 2 to more than 20 times larger than [ ] fluxes measured by visir , with the exception of one object , which might thus be compatible with the other class i stars .",
    "this discrepancy strongly suggets that the [ ] emission observed from _ spitzer _ in most class",
    "i objects is spatially extended , i.e. it is not produced within the inner disk ( r@xmath4620 - 40 au ) , but in the outer regions of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "alternatively , the emission may span a very broad range of velocities , such that the upper limits reported in table [ tab : results ] could be underestimated ( up to a factor 5 if we consider a line marginally resolved from _ spitzer_/irs at high resolution mode ) .",
    "however , both scenarios would suggest that neon in class i objects is most likely ionized by shocks produced by protostellar outflows . to better investigate the [ ] emission from shocks located several aus from the star ,",
    "a different observational strategy is required . as previously done for t tau by @xcite , the position and the velocity structure of multiple knots composing a jet and emitting in the [ ]",
    "can be studied by performing several long slit observations with different slit orientations to cover a large area around the target .",
    "furthermore , to perform a complete study of the physical structure of protostellar jets , the results of these observations can be compared with narrow band imaging and spectroastrometric observations in other forbidden lines , like the [ ] doublet at 6717 and 6731   or the [ ] at 6300  .",
    "on the other hand , in ysos which are classified as transition or pre - transition disks ( tr and ptr in table [ obs - target ] and black dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : visir_vs_spitzer ] ) , the ratio between [ ] fluxes measured by the two instruments is consistently less than 2 , with the exception of two stars for which the upper limits might be compatible with other transition and pre - transition disks .",
    "for the 3 objects detected with both instruments , the ratio is consistent with 1 at the 3 @xmath26 confidence level .",
    "we conclude that , in transition and pre - transition disks , the bulk of the [ ] emission is produced within @xmath120 - 40 aus of the central star . in the next section , we will discuss if this emission is due to a static disk atmosphere , a photoevaporative wind , or a magnetically accelerated outflow .",
    "it is more complicated to interpret results for class ii ysos , namely stars harbouring an optically thick disk .",
    "we detected the [ ] emission in 4 class ii ysos .",
    "since the ratio between spitzer and visir fluxes ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath110 , the spatially extended emission appears to be dominant , but significant emission from the inner disk may also be present .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the detection of spatially unresolved [ ] emission in most of the transition and pre - transition disks demonstrates that the [ ] line is produced within the inner disk ( less than 20 - 40 aus from the star ) suggesting that neon is ionized by the high energy emission from the central star .",
    "however , the emission may be produced by a static disk atmosphere , a photoevaporative wind @xcite , or a magnetically accelerated outflow @xcite .",
    "the width and the velocity shift of the [ ] line at 12.81 @xmath0 m should differ in these three cases .",
    "the emission from a static disk atmosphere should arise at the same mean radial velocity as the central star , with a broadening proportional to the disk inclination ( e.g. the [ ] emission from gm aur observed by @xcite ) ; whereas a photoevaporative wind  unless the disk has a large ( @xmath130 au ) inner disk hole @xcite  will produce blue - shifted emission with respect to the central star ( @xmath47 ) and , again , a broadening proportional to the disk inclination . blue - shifted emission , very likely originating from a photoevaporative wind , has previously been observed in 3 transitional disks ( t cha , cs cha and tw hydrae ) by @xcite . finally , the emission line from a magnetically driven outflow should be blue - shifted to a larger velocity ( @xmath48 ) and much broader than emission from a disk , as observed , e.g. in sz 73 by @xcite .    in fig . [",
    "fig : fwhm_vs_vshift ] , we show the fwhms of the detected lines as function of their blue - shifts with respect to the central star velocity .",
    "colors represent the different infrared classes , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : visir_vs_spitzer ] .",
    "our results rule out the possibility that the [ ] emission is produced by a static disk atmosphere , since all of the detected lines are blue - shifted with respect to the central star . in two of the stars of our sample ( ru lupi and irs 60 ) the emission likely originates from a magnetically driven outflow , as demonstrated by the large blue - shift ( v@xmath494 and v@xmath50 , respectively ) and the large fwhm ( 107@xmath51 and 49@xmath52 , respectively ) of the observed emission lines .",
    "this hypothesis is confirmed by observational evidence that indicate ru lupi is the source of a well - known protostellar jet ( e.g. @xcite ) , and by the proximity of irs 60 to a herbig - haro objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the line profile of ru lupi ( top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) appears slightly asymmetric , with the bluer part of the profile decreasing faster than the redder part .",
    "similar asymmetric and strongly blue - shifted profiles have been predicted by @xcite , who modeled the [ ] emission produced by a magnetically accelerated wind irradiated by stellar high energy emission .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise is too low to carry out a detailed comparison between our spectra and these models . in the spectra of irs",
    "43 n and irs 43 s , we also observe a secondary emission component that is strongly blue - shifted and asymmetric .",
    "however , although in each case the profile of this component resembles the profiles predicted by @xcite , these highly blue - shifted and asymmetric components from both irs 43 n and irs 43 s are too weak to establish if the resemblance is significant .",
    "the emission observed from the other 10 ysos is blue - shifted by less than 18 @xmath2 . for 5 of our targets ,",
    "specifically transition and pre - transition disks , a disk origin is confirmed by the correlation between line fwhm and the disk inclination .",
    "the correlation is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : inclination ] , where we also plot two points from @xcite .",
    "in this panel , we also report the relation between fwhm and disk inclination derived from irradiated primordial and transition disk models by @xcite .",
    "our measurements agree very well with the models , except in the case of ru lupi and t cha ( the points on the top - left and top - right of the plot ) . in the first case , the emission is likely not due to a photoevaporative wind , but rather to a magnetically accelerated outflow , as discussed above , so the models of @xcite are not applicable . in the case of t cha",
    "the discrepancy between models and observational data may be related to the difference between the mass of t cha ( 1.3 m@xmath53 from @xcite ) and the mass of the central star assumed in the models ( 0.7 m@xmath53 ) .",
    "discrepancies between the models and observations are more evident in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : inclination ] , where we plot the line blue - shift as a function of disk inclination .",
    "specifically , the observed blue - shifts are higher than the predicted ones .",
    "higher blue - shifts have been predicted by @xcite , who considered a warmer disk atmosphere ( t@xmath110,000 k ) irradiated by stellar euv radiation .    for the other 5 ysos with an observed blue - shift of less than 18 @xmath2 ( irs 43 n , irs 43 s , irs 45 , sstc2dj162145.13 - 234231.6 and t cra )",
    ", the origin of the emission is less clear , because we do not know the disk inclination .",
    "furthermore , four of these objects are in the earliest stage of the disk evolution ( 3 class i irs 43 n , irs 43 s and sstc2dj162145.13 - 234231.6 and a class ii irs 45 ) and the line fwhm is larger than observed in the transition disks , so the [ ] line at 12.81 @xmath0 m could be produced by a jet seen with a large angle respect to the line of sight .",
    "we also note that in these objects errors on the blue - shift could be underestimated , because no radial velocities measurements are available in the literature , so we based our radial velocity estimate on the radial velocity of the parent cloud ( @xmath11 ophiuchi ) or other nearby stars ( see table [ obs - target ] ) .",
    "observations aimed to measure accurate radial velocities and disk inclinations for these stars can help to distinguish between jet and disk origins .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] we report the [ ] luminosity as a function of the x - ray luminosity , with the predictions of @xcite overplotted with a dashed line .",
    "[ ] emission and x - ray luminosities do not appear correlated , as would be expected from the irradiated disk models ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and as has been observed by @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of a correlation between [ ] emission and x - ray luminosities could be due to the non - homogeneity of the observed sample .",
    "specifically , our sample includes very different disks around stars of different mass that are going through different phases of the star formation process , while irradiated - disk models that predict a correlation focused their analysis on a single prototypical disk .",
    "the relation between disk properties and predicted [ ] luminosity has been investigated by @xcite , who found that varying disk properties can cause luminosity variations up to one order of magnitude .",
    "several upper limits in fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] ( left panel ) lie below the [ ] luminosity predicted from the model of @xcite . the lack of detectable [ ] emission in class i and class ii sources could depend on the effects of absorption on x - ray and euv emission .",
    "specifically , if euv and x - ray emission are strongly attenuated by the optically thick inner disk layers , the amount of ionized neon could be less than predicted by the models . in transition disks  like hen 3 - 600 , for which the upper limit on the [ ] luminosity is one order of magnitude below the expected value - the discrepancy between model and observations may be attributed to the opposite reason ; namely , some of these disks have lost a large part of their circumstellar gas , so we do not see strong emission lines in the mid - infrared . in the case of hen 3 - 600 , a non - detection of [ ] emission is consistent both with the lack of detection of molecular co emission @xcite and its low mass accretion rate ( see table [ obs - target ] ) .",
    "in contrast , higher mass accretion rates and strong molecular co emission ( see @xcite ) characterize tw hya , v4046 sgr and mp mus where a strong [ ] emission was detected .",
    "another possibility is that neon is ionized by euv or soft x - ray photons mainly produced by accretion shocks , hence the line emission a 12.81 @xmath0 m strongly decreases at low mass accretion rates .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] shows a weak correlation between [ ] luminosity and mass accretion rate , but this correlation is strongly influenced by just three objects ( ru lupi , irs 43 n and irs 43 s ) .",
    "as discussed above , the [ ] emission in ru lupi is produced by a protostellar jet , while the origin of the emission from irs 43 n and irs 43 s is uncertain .",
    "so , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , the correlation between [ ] luminosity and mass accretion rate may be driven by the presence of strong emission from jet sources , which are typically strong accretors .",
    "we observed 32 ysos belonging to different infrared classes using the high resolution ( r@xmath130000 ) mid - infrared spectrograph visir at the vlt , with the aim of studying the origin of the [ ] emission line at 12.81 @xmath0 m .",
    "we detected the line in 12 ysos , thus tripling the number of detections of 12.81 @xmath0 m [ ] emission in ysos at high spectral resolution .",
    "we also collected from the literature published _",
    "spitzer_/irs data for 14 of our targets and analyzed archival data for another 14 stars . by comparing vlt / visir and _ spitzer_/irs data with ancillary data retrieved from the literature , we obtained the following results :    * comparison between visir ( slit width 0.4@xmath16 ) and irs ( slit width@xmath18 ) fluxes demonstrates that for class i ysos the [ ] emission is mainly produced by gas located at a distance of more than 20 - 40 au ( i.e. , outside of the visir slit but within the irs slit ) from the central star and , therefore , arises from the extended envelopes . at these distances from the star , neon is most likely ionized by energetic shocks produced from protostellar outflows . *",
    "the same comparison ( visir vs. irs ) shows that the [ ] emission from transition and pre - transition disks is produced by gas located within a few au from the central stars , while in class ii objects we observe emission both from the inner region and from the extended envelope . *",
    "observed blue - shifts and fwhms of the [ ] line are consistent with emission in either a photoevaporative wind or the launching region of magnetically driven outflow .",
    "we associated the emission with a photoevaporative wind in 5 pre - main sequence stars with transition and/or pre - transition disks ( blue - shifts between 2 and 18 @xmath2 , fwhm between 15 and 45 @xmath2 ) , where we observe a correlation between line fwhm and disk inclination .",
    "otherwise , we associated the emission to an outflow in two objects ( blue - shifts of 55 and 168 @xmath2 , fwhm of 49 and 107 @xmath2 ) , one of which , ru lupi , is a prototypical target for studies of protostellar jets .",
    "the origin of the emission in the remaining 5 objects is more uncertain .",
    "* we compared the dependence of line fwhm and blue - shift on disk inclinations with the predictions of irradiated disk models of @xcite .",
    "the observed relation between line fwhm and disk inclination is consistent with the predictions of models , except for a single star ( t cha ) whose disk is seen at high inclination angle .",
    "line blue - shifts are larger than predicted from the models .",
    "+ blue - shifted emission and a correlation of the line width with disk inclination have been also predicted in the case of photoevaporative wind triggered by euv radiation @xcite .",
    "* we detected [ ] emission with a blue - shifts smaller than @xmath54 from 3 class i objects and 2 class ii objects .",
    "although these projected velocities appears small for an outflow origin , and would rather point toward a disk wind , we have no constraints on the inclinations of these systems and thus on the true velocity of the emitting material .",
    "our observations demonstrate that the [ ] emission in ysos arises either from shocks formed in protostellar jets or from a photoevaporative wind in the inner disk , and high spatial and spectral resolutions observations are necessary to distinguish between the two mechanisms .",
    "specifically , the former mechanism prevails in early stages of the star formation process when powerful outflows are generated , while the latter prevails in the latest stages of disk evolution .",
    "however , to understand if the two processes may coexist and photoevaporative winds are already active at early stages , a better knowledge of disk properties ( i.e. disk inclination , radial velocities and disk structure ) is required .",
    "the new instruments operating in mid - infrared and submillimeter band ( vlt / crires , herschel , alma ) will allow us to better study these systems and interpret our results .    for what concerns the more evolved transition and pre - transition disks , the presence of emission blue - shifted of @xmath55 and the correlation between line width and disk inclination are strong evidences for the photoevaporation from the disk .",
    "however , observations in the [ ] line are not sufficient to understand the full physical scenario , specifically , it is not clear if euv emission produced by accretion shocks or x - rays produced either by accretion shocks or coronae is the main driver of photoevaporation and disk heating .",
    "high spectral resolution observations of other forbidden forbidden emission lines ( e.g. [ ] at 6300  , @xcite ) emitted in the inner disk region may help to address this issue .",
    "finally , we detected the [ ] line in only 13 ysos out of the 32 observed .",
    "this is not surprising given that upper limits are in many cases of the same order of magnitude of the expected luminosity ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] ) .",
    "therefore , our study is biased toward stronger and closer sources . a higher sensitivity instrument is required to observe a larger and more complete sample and thereby to fully explore the space of physical parameters of the star - disk system .",
    "the upgraded vlt / visir expected in the next summer will be a first step in this direction .",
