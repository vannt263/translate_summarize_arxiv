    "frequency range of 28  40 mhz is observed to be less influenced by noise [ 1 ] .",
    "the goal of our new measurements is not only to study nature of extensive air showers ( eas ) radio emission , but obtaining an independent estimation of such characteristics as energy of primary particle and to explain the connection between longitudinal development of eas and shape of spatial distribution of the radio emission .",
    "the array currently consists two set of antennas , distance between them is 500 m. first set consists 8 antennas , second  4 antennas . the antenna is a perpendicularly crossed dipoles , one to direction w - e , other n - s and lifted to the height 1.5 m above the ground .",
    "each set is connected to an industrial computer . directly under the antennas",
