    "since the canonical quantization procedure of fields requires a `` frequency splitting '' with respect to the time , the absence of a timelike symmetry group in general curved spacetimes causes severe problems ( see @xcite ) in the construction of quantum fields .",
    "the nature of these problems becomes particularly clear in the algebraic formulation of quantum field theory ( @xcite ) , where an algebra of observables @xmath0 is associated to each region @xmath1 in spacetime .",

    "this may be derived ( see @xcite ) from a mean value theorem by asgeirsson ( @xcite ) and one of its consequences , namely that a solution to the wave equation vanishing in such a tube , vanishes in the causal completion of this tube ( see @xcite ) . as far as more general spacetimes",
    "are concerned the author showed recently that a similar result holds for stationary spacetimes and quite general free fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "namely the field algebra associated with a non - void open set which is invariant under the time translation is equal to the quasilocal algebra .",
    "this result was used there to prove the reeh - schlieder property of vacuum - like states .",
    "the question arises whether such a result holds for more general spacetimes . as we will see this question",
    "is strongly related to the timelike cauchy problem for second order hyperbolic partial differential equations . in the case of analytic coefficients on an analytic manifold",
    "holmgrens uniqueness theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) states that there is unique continuation of solutions across any non - characteristic hypersurface .",
    "relaxing however the condition of analyticity , counterexamples show that the cauchy problem for timelike surfaces is ill posed in the general case of partial differential equations with smooth coefficients ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . even for the wave operator @xmath4 in minkowski spacetime it is known ( see @xcite ) that there exists a smooth function @xmath5 such that there is a solution @xmath6 to the equation @xmath7 which has support equal to a half - space with timelike boundary .",
    "it was quite recently shown by tataru in @xcite and further generalized by hrmander in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that under partial analyticity assumptions one still has unique continuation of solutions across non - characteristic surfaces .",
