    "our system consists of a pristine crystalline solid whose surfaces are shaped to create a stable phonon resonator geometry that traps ultra - high @xmath2-factor ( @xmath3 ) phonon modes . by engineering the optomechanical coupling between these high @xmath2-factor phonon modes and an incident laser - field ,",

    "since this mean free path ( @xmath12 ) is much smaller than the crystal length ( @xmath13 mm ) , the phonons decay before a round trip oscillation can be completed . however , at cryogenic temperatures , intrinsic phonon dissipation is dramatically reduced @xcite , permitting the phonons to traverse multiple cavity round - trips , forming ultra - high @xmath2-factor phonon modes @xcite . in the limit as the phonon coherence is much greater than the system length ( @xmath14 ) , the dynamics of photon - phonon coupling becomes quite different from what has historically been termed brillouin interactions . to differentiate these two regimes of interaction we term them the brillouin - limit ( @xmath15 ) and the coherent - phonon limit ( @xmath14 ) respectively . in the coherent - phonon limit",
    "we will show that the nature of this coupling is altered , giving rise to greatly enhanced nonlinear susceptibilities as well as a form of dispersive symmetry breaking that enable new approaches for phonon self - oscillation or phonon cooling within this bulk crystalline system .",
    "we experimentally explore the strength and character of the optomechanical coupling using continuous - wave pump - probe spectroscopy .",
    "we quantify the phonon - mediated energy transfer between counter - propagating pump - wave , with frequency @xmath16 , and probe - wave , with frequency @xmath17 , using the basic experimental configuration illustrated in fig [ teach]a .",
    "both the pump- and probe - beams pass once through the phononic cavity ; the light - field is not resonantly enhanced within the crystal . in this experiment , stimulated emission of a phonon is observed as energy transfer between the two incident optical beams via the three - wave interaction of fig .",

    "in other words , each volume element within the crystal can be viewed as an independent system , which supplies distributed brillouin gain as the pump and probe waves interact within the crystal .    in the brillouin - limit , because elastic waves are heavily damped in comparison to the system size ( @xmath15 ) , the density of phonon modes ( or density of states ) can be viewed as continuous . damping also effectively broadens the phonon dispersion curve .",

    "the @xmath51 cavity mode , with decay rate @xmath52 , will have have a lorentzian width ( @xmath52 ) in the frequency domain .",
    "however , in contrast with the brillouin limit , because the spatial extent of the standing - wave is finite ( i.e. , abruptly terminates at the crystal faces ) , the phonon wavevector occupies a band of spatial frequencies and takes on a @xmath53 form .",

    "therefore , each acoustic cavity mode has a frequency / wavevector response depicted by the lower right inset of fig .",

    ", we will show that in comparison to the brillouin limit , the nonlinear optical coupling strength can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude , and the dynamics of photon - phonon coupling become nontrivial and depends on phonon propagation .",
    "moreover , this interaction opens the door to new regimes of dynamics including optomechanical self - oscillation and mode - cooling processes , akin to cavity optomechanical systems .",
    "a key requirement for reaching these new regimes of dynamics is low - loss phonon modes that exhibit appreciable coupling to the light - field .",
    "therefore , as detailed in the following section , the geometry of the crystal and the overlap between the phonon mode and the light - field become crucial considerations .",
    "above , we have considered the simplified case of 1d wave propagation in a finite crystal with varying degrees of acoustic loss . in practice , spatial dispersion and the geometry of our 3d crystal",
    "strongly impact the lifetime and character of the resonantly excited phonon modes .",
    "for instance , enhancement of the susceptibility is severely limited within a flat - flat crystal because this planar geometry forms an unstable resonator . in this case ,",
    "phonon modes excited by a finite laser beam suffer appreciable diffractive losses , limiting the phonon @xmath2-factor and nonlinear enhancement at cryogenic temperatures ( supplement section 5 ) .    to greatly enhance this coupling , we shape the surfaces of the crystal to form ultra - high @xmath2-factor phonon modes that are tightly confined , permitting efficient coupling to a laser beam with a small ( @xmath55 m ) spot size at @xmath56 ghz frequencies . a plano - convex resonator geometry is known to support stable hermite - gaussian modes for optical waves propagating in an isotropic medium @xcite .",
    "however , for the complex elastic wave dynamics in anisotropic crystals , it is not clear that a comparable stable cavity exists .",
    "therefore , we develop an acoustic beam propagation algorithm which accounts for the anisotropic elastic properties of the crystal and the curvature of the cavity end - faces . we demonstrate stable acoustic resonators in a plano - convex geometry , and by adapting optical design principles to the case of anisotropic elastic wave propagation , we create stable resonator geometries ( fig .",

    "the modal mass @xcite , given by the mode size and the mass density is 60 @xmath59 g ( supplement section 2.4 ) .",
    "this large modal mass represents a unique and valuable aspect of this system compared to less massive cavity optimechanical systems for its value for studies of quantum decoherence ( see further information in the discussion ) . for device parameters and simulation methods ,",
    "see supplement section 5 .    to explore optomechanical coupling in both the brillouin and coherent - phonon limits of operation , we perform phonon - mediated energy transfer measurements in both crystal species . stimulated energy transfer between counter - propagating pump and probe beams",

    "stimulated stokes scattering is observed as a fractional increase in the probe power ( @xmath62 ) while the probe frequency is tuned .",

    "note that this formulation ( supplement section 2 - 2.4 ) assumes that the optical beam profiles are uniform , and the propagating optical fields do not grow rapidly in space ( for a more general treatment , not subject to these constraints , see supplement section 2.6 ) .",
    "this newly defined coupling rate , @xmath93 , can be related directly to the multimode cavity optomechanical coupling rate , @xmath94 , under certain limits in which a the cavity mode is equivalent to the traveling wave as detailed in the section 2.5 of the supplement .",
    "notice that phase - matching is implicit in our geometric coupling rate , @xmath95 . in the case",
    "when the incident fields are monochromatic , and the coupling is weak , @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be replaced with sharply peaked distributions consistent with the frequency and wavevector of each laser - field ; in this limit one can readily show that the nonlinear optical susceptibility takes on the form @xmath98^{-1}\\textrm{sinc}^2 [ ( q(\\omega_m ) -\\delta k_s ( \\omega))l/2]$ ] ( see supplement section 2.2 ) .",
    "this form of the susceptibility is identical to that obtained through phase - matching considerations ( section [ ocsec ] ) , demonstrating the equivalence between the two pictures .",

    "when @xmath107 reaches unity , phonon self - oscillation and appreciable mode - cooling are possible . for phonon self - oscillation , within our quartz crystal , a dissipation rate of 300 hz translates to a threshold power of 7.2 watts .",
    "interestingly , the combination of high power handling and ultra - high @xmath2-factor phonon modes within this bulk crystalline system could lead to extraordinary spectral - narrowing as the basis for new oscillator technologies @xcite .",
    "through optomechanical interactions , a phonon mode can typically mediate stokes and anti - stokes processes simultaneously ; to engineer useful optomechanical operations , we typically seek to control which process will occur .",

    "for instance , in order to selectively heat or cool a phonon mode it is necessary to bias the system , giving preference to either stokes and anti - stokes processes . in the context of cavity optomechanics , stokes and anti - stokes symmetry breaking is achieved by detuning the frequency of incident pump - wave from the optical cavity resonance .",
    "however , our bulk crystalline system does not possess an optical cavity , and we will see that a cavity is unnecessary to bias the system .    in stark contrast to cavity optomechanical systems , this bulk crystalline optomechanical system produces a form of _ dispersive _ symmetry breaking , arising from distinct phase - matching requirements imposed by stokes and anti - stokes scattering . in other words ,",
    "this system exhibits a new form of symmetry breaking that enables phonon heating or cooling _ without _ an optical cavity ( which we refer to as cavity - less optomechanics ) .",
    "energy conservation ( @xmath113 ) and phase - matching ( @xmath114 ) conditions for the anti - stokes process combine to require @xmath115 , whereas stokes scattering requires @xmath116 .",
    "the sign - difference in these two relations results in a difference between the peak - frequency of the stokes ( @xmath20 ) and anti - stokes ( @xmath117 ) processes .",
    "the stokes scattering is a maximum for phonon - modes of frequency @xmath118 whereas anti - stokes scattering is maximum for @xmath119 , where @xmath120 . for typical parameters ( e.g. 5-mm long z - cut quartz )",
    ", this gives a dispersive frequency difference , @xmath121 of @xmath122 mhz , which becomes significant in the coherent - phonon limit .",
    "since phase matching is implicit in our definition of the geometric coupling rate , @xmath95 , the effect of the relative stokes / anti - stokes frequency shift can be seen by comparing the stokes ( @xmath123 ) and anti - stokes ( @xmath124 ) coupling rates .",
    "[ stat]a(i - iii ) compare the stokes / anti - stokes coupling rates as a function of phonon frequency ( mode number ) for crystal lengths ( @xmath125 ) of 1 , 5 , 20 mm .",

    "the measured geometric couplings associated with the stokes and anti - stokes processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ stat]c for z - cut quartz .",
    "comparison of these two measurements reveals a dispersive frequency shift of 830 khz , which agrees well with calculations .    in conjunction with theory",
    ", these measurements reveal that dispersive symmetry breaking produces a very strong differential gain , as the basis for selective mode heating / cooling in this system . for instance , the data of fig .",
    "[ stat]c reveal that phonon mode @xmath127 is @xmath128 times more likely to experience stokes scattering , whereas mode @xmath129 is @xmath130 times more likely to experience anti - stokes scattering .",
    "hence , these measurements illustrate how dispersive symmetry breaking permits mode selective heating or cooling within this bulk crystalline system .",
    "see supplement section 7 for more information .",
    "in the preceding section , we have shown that mode - cooling and mode - heating can be readily performed using this cavity - less optomechanical system . as we examine the range of possible uses for this system , it is also intriguing to note that this crystalline quartz system can support immense optical powers ( kw to mw ) without adverse effects @xcite . since the dispersive symmetry breaking ( section [ sbr ] ) is compatible with the use of relatively short pulses ( @xmath131ns ) , we can use pulses to reach very large cooperativities ( @xmath132 ) within this cavity - less system . the idea of using pulses to perform quantum control",
    "has been recognized as a fertile direction in numerous prior works @xcite , and phase - matched optomechanical coupling within this bulk crystalline system may offer a different way of approaching these ideas . building on these concepts , one can now consider using this system to perform quantum control or entanglement operations using these ultra - high @xmath2-factor phonon modes .",
    "pulses are not necessary to reach new regimes of nonlinear dynamics , however . even under continuous - wave ( cw ) operation ,",
    "mode cooling and phonon self - oscillation are within reach if cooperativities are increased from their current values ( @xmath133 ) to @xmath134 .",
    "the cooperativity , @xmath109 , is increased by reducing the phonon dissipation rate ( @xmath52 ) while increasing the coupling rate ( @xmath135 ) and the incident pump - power ( @xmath108 ) . with fixed material properties ( e.g. with quartz ) cooperativities of unity",
    "can be attained by improving the acousto - optic overlap and boosting the pump power to 2 watts .",
    "it is also interesting to note that greatly reduced phonon dissipation rates ( @xmath52 ) may be possible with further device refinement .",
    "for example , with improved surface quality and crystal purity , significant reductions in phonon dissipation rates are possible .",
    "since the roughness - induced diffraction losses scale with the root - mean - squared roughness to the 2@xmath136 power , a modest ( 2-fold ) reduction in the surface roughness could translate to a 4-fold reduction in dissipation rate ( assuming that surface roughness plays a dominate role in dissipation ) , potentially reducing the phonon self - oscillation optical threshold ( @xmath137 ) to @xmath138 watts .    cooperativities can also be drastically enhanced by constructing our optomechanical system using media with a larger photo - elastic response . for a fixed optical wavelength and mode - matched optical and acoustic waves ,",
    "the cooperativity scales as @xmath139 .",
    "hence , the coupling rate is enhanced by reducing the acoustic dissipation ( @xmath52 ) or improving the material photo - elastic response .",
    "for fixed crystal geometry ( @xmath140 mm ) , enhanced photo - elastic response produced by pbmoo4 , ge , and gaas produce bare coupling rates ( @xmath135 ) of @xmath64144 , @xmath64266 , and @xmath64292 hz at center frequencies of 11 , 26 , and 25 ghz , respectively .",
    "hence , comparable phonon dissipation rates ( @xmath141 hz ) within these media translate to self - oscillation threshold ( @xmath142 powers of @xmath64175 , @xmath6440 and @xmath6433 mw , respectively .",
    "this bulk crystalline optomechanical system also provides optical access to a large range of phonon - mode sizes and masses .",
    "phonon resonators can be formed in cavities as short as tens of microns to as long as tens of centimeters with corresponding phonon motional masses spanning from nanograms to grams .",
    "counterintuitively , one finds that cooperativity ( @xmath139 ) is invariant with volume of the phonon mode ( or modal mass ) .",
    "this is of considerable interest because the combination of coherent quantum states and large masses are required to test fundamental theories of quantum decoherence and quantum gravity ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite for more information ) .",
    "it is instructive to contemplate the construction of a cavity - optomechanical system which harnesses the presented bulk crystalline phonon modes by , for example , placing the bulk crystalline system of fig .",
    "1a within an optical cavity .",
    "a cavity - optomechanical system of this type could offer intriguing opportunities .",
    "for instance , the extraordinarily high power handling of this crystalline system permits intracavity power enhancement to reach high cooperativies ( @xmath143 ) with cw operation . assuming that the crystal is placed within an optical cavity whose length matches the crystal length ( @xmath125 ) and maintains the modal overlap , the coupling rate of this cavity - system will be equivalent to the coupling rates ( @xmath91 ) measured in this paper ( see supplement section 2.5 ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the intracavity power will be resonantly enhanced by a factor of the optical finesse ( @xmath144 ) , permitting extraordinarily high cooperativities ( @xmath145 ) within high finesse ( @xmath146 ) cavities using moderate incident powers ( 100 mw ) .",
    "brillouin - based optomechanical coupling in an optical cavity have been demonstrated in microcavities @xcite at room temperatures as well as in an ultra - cold ( 15 mk ) superfluid @xcite .",
    "the bulk crystalline system , owing to its simple configuration with minimal contribution from surfaces , allows for material - limited phononic dissipation at desirable high frequencies ( @xmath147 ghz ) .",
    "moreover , since practically any transparent crystalline solid can be shaped into a low loss phononic resonator , a wide range of materials provides a flexible design space for specific applications .",
    "each material offers a different phonon frequency , wavelength transparency , and may permit coupling to a range of additional excitations .",
    "for example , by utilizing a piezoelectric material , the cavity optomechanical system could combine with the electromechanical coupling techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite for a high frequency rf - to - optical conversion platform @xcite .",
    "phonon modes of the type from this bulk crystalline system can also be readily coupled with superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "the task of adapting this bulk crystalline system to a cavity - optomechanical system presents some challenges ; one must exercise great care in the design of phonon modes and optical modes depending on the optical and elastic properties of the crystal .",
    "for instance , the cavities required to produce optimal phonon confinement and optical confinement are likely to be very different ; this is because nontrivial dispersion surfaces of the elastic medium drastically alter the conditions for stable phonon cavity - mode formation ( for further discussion see supplement section 5 ) .",
    "moreover , while it is tempting to consider creating an optical cavity by depositing multi - layer stacks directly on the crystal , one must also be cognizant of the fact that ( perhaps large ) excess phonon dissipation will be accompanied by deposition of layered media on the crystal surface @xcite .",
    "whether the bulk crystalline system has an optical cavity or not , the techniques developed in the present work are essential for optimizing phonon dissipation , material type , material quality , and optomechanical coupling . in other words , here we have taken the crucial steps required before constructing more sophisticated cavity optomechanical systems .",
    "looking ahead , it is clear that the field of quantum information and quantum measurement have growing need for ultra - low dissipation modes within optical , acoustic , and electromagnetic systems .",
    "as we evaluate the best approach for obtaining low - loss phonon modes in bulk or micro - scale systems , it remains unclear which materials are most ideal as the basis for high performance optomechanical @xcite , electro - optomechanical @xcite , or quantum - phononic systems @xcite ; improved understanding of cryogenic phonon dissipation could provide crucial upper bound for device performance . to date , we have a fragmented understanding of the limits of phonon dissipation ; aside from crystalline quartz , very few crystalline media have been exhaustively studied at cryogenic temperatures . with our laser - based approach to analyzing phonon dissipation , we have demonstrated @xmath79 products of @xmath80 hz , which are comparable to the world - class quartz electromechanical systems of ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , since _ all _ media posses photoelastic response , we can use these non - invasive laser - based optomechanical techniques to study practically any bulk crystalline medium .",
    "hence , beyond new device concepts , bulk crystalline optomechanics has the potential to greatly expand our knowledge of cryogenic phonon physics .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated bulk crystalline optomechanics with macroscopic pristine single - crystal shaped acoustic resonators . through a brillouin - like coupling , high frequency ( @xmath147 ghz )",
    "ultra - high @xmath2-factor phonon - modes are stimulated and detected with light .",
    "photon - phonon coupling in this bulk crystalline system presents an array of opportunities for both spectroscopy and optomechanical device design . in the context of nonlinear optics ,",
    "this process is an extreme limit of brillouin interactions wherein excited phonons become highly non - local and coherent . in the context of optomechanical phenomena , coupling to such mesoscopic phonon modes",

    "from either perspective , dramatic ( @xmath150-fold ) enhancement of the nonlinear coupling is achieved by trapping ultra high @xmath2-factor phonon modes in the focus of an incident laser beam .",
