    "the prerequisite for the design and optimization of nanomaterials for a given application is an understanding of the relationship between structure and physical properties  @xcite .",
    "however , with large nanomaterials , on scales of several thousand atoms and more , there are large uncertainties and imprecise structural information  @xcite .",
    "this is caused by both the lack of atomic resolution of structural characterization methods , and limitations of predictive theory methods , such as those previously successfully applied in , e.g. , molecular spectroscopy  @xcite , or on a few - atom scale to predict new materials  @xcite .    for large nanomaterials ,",
    "the full atomistic structure is represented only indirectly by descriptive quantities , `` motifs '' such as chemical composition profile ( ccp ) , geometry , confining potential , etc .",
    "this leads to the loss of structural information . the full structural information , atoms and their positions , is replaced by the partial structural information contained in motifs .",
    "whereas knowledge of the full information guarantees knowledge of partial representations of the structure via motifs , knowledge of partial representations is not , in general , sufficient to determine uniquely the underlying atomistic structure .",
    "consequently , different partial representations of the same full structure can exist , e.g. , as `` seen '' by experiment and theory , illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig.1 ]  ( a )  and  ( b ) .",
    "often , these representations are reconciled by `` cherry - picking '' one solution that fits all constraints , regardless of how loose they might be .    , illustrating variation from linear to step - like .",

    "[ fig : fig.1 ] ]    for example , it was shown that the interface in a core / shell cdznse / znse nanocrystal was key in interpreting absence of intensity fluctuations in photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra , also known as blinking  @xcite .",
    "the electron micorgraph of a cdznse / znse nanocrystal could not give precise information about the interface between cdznse core and znse shell , so numerical calculations were used to find a possible composition profile at the interface that would eliminate blinking .",
    "in this case , structural information was deduced from two sources : ( i ) structural characterization measurements , which gave one partial structural representation , and ( ii ) predictive theory , which was based on the desired outcome ( no blinking in the pl spectra ) . in order to get the best possible representation of the structure using employed motifs , these need to be reconciled .    in this work ,",
    "we show how to reconcile partial structural representations using constraints from structural characterization measurements and theory to maximally exploit the limited amount of data available from experiment .",
    "we determine a range of parameter space where predictive theory can be used to design and optimize the structure .",
    "using an example of variation of chemical composition profile across the interface of two nanomaterials , we demonstrate how , given experimental and theoretical constraints , to find a region of structure - parameter space within which computationally explored partial representations of the full structure will have observable real - world counterparts .",
    "this example is chosen because , in addition to enabling us to discuss the underlying ideas in an elegant way and without lost of generality ( see below ) , the findings could be directly relevant to the analysis of e.g. , diode lasers from epitaxial ii - vi and iii - v semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , calculated strength of evidence shows that resulting ccp certainly belongs to @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath61 , but it is likely @xmath0 .",

    "( b ) the same as ( a ) , but for the case where any ccp from @xmath11 is acceptable both according to the structural characterization measurements and theory .",
    "[ fig : fig.2 ] ]    consequently , we can interpret these findings from a different perspective , if we could resolve the structure on the atomistic level using theory and provide input to experiment , e.g. , to guide fabrication / synthesis , obviously , we would still lack the feedback from the experiment of how the real - world structure actually looks like .    figure  [ fig : fig.2](b ) shows the results for the case where both experimental and theoretical predictions are unconstrained . in that case , as intuitively clear , it can only be concluded that any ccp from @xmath11 could be a solution , but nothing more specific .",
    "next , we impose additional constraints , i.e. , precise data from structural characterization measurements and theoretical predictions . the calculated @xmath47 and @xmath48 are shown in figure  [ fig : fig.3](a ) . to obtain the results within our model , and understand how they should be interpreted we construct the following experimental and theoretical premises .    _",
    "( i ) structural characterization measurements _ can detect variation of ccp across the interface ( where diffusion has been often assumed to follow fick s law ) , but not resolve the gradient  @xcite . for our test study , starting from the initial set @xmath11 , this gives a subset of ccps , @xmath62 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "given that @xmath48 represents support coming from all subsets of @xmath11 intersecting with a given subset , @xmath65 .",

    "( ii ) as allowed by theory _",
    ", different ccps can be obtained by linking the variation of ccp across the interface with the shift of the peak pl energy for the sample of interest  @xcite .",
    "thus , for our case study , from the initial set @xmath11 , we select ccps given in @xmath67 .",
    "this gives @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig.3 ] ( b ) shows @xmath57 calculated using the ds rule of combination .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath57 is used to identify the targeted subset of ccps , which is found to be @xmath71 .",
    "this means that in the parameter space of the partial structural representations , i.e. , ccps and the corresponding values they may take , there is a subset of ccps ( @xmath71 ) that is accepted by both experiment and theory . also , after ds rule is applied , @xmath72 .",
    "this means that it is more likely to find a targeted ccp in @xmath73 and/or @xmath74 than in @xmath71 , as @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "identified subset of ccps , @xmath71 , with three ccps in figure  [ fig : fig.3 ]  ( b ) , represents a tentative solution based on the currently available experimental and theoretical evidence . with further evidence introduced , e.g. , additional measurements ,",
    "the set of acceptable ccps can change .",
    "if we seek the true solution , then we should have full structural information ; i.e. , atoms and their positions .    , and",
    "the calculated total amount of potential specific support , @xmath48 , that could be given to a @xmath22 and @xmath23 . according to experiment",
    ", any ccp in @xmath22 is acceptable , and according to theory , any ccp in @xmath23 ; ( b ) reconciling the two partial representations of the structure , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with the corresponding @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the dempster - shafer ( ds ) rule of combination is used to calculate @xmath57 , which identifies the subset of ccps , @xmath71 , that is acceptable by both , structural characterization and theory . [",
    "fig : fig.3 ] ]    from a broader perspective , @xmath71 actually gives us a region of the structural parameter space within which explored and/or computationally designed partial structural representations of the structure can have observable real - world counterparts .",
    "thus , by computationally exploring / searching the parameters within the space identified by the ds rule , we are able to provide input to fabrication / synthesis , useful from a design and optimization viewpoint , because it can be registered by the structural characterization and provide relevant feedback to the theory .",
    "furthermore , arbitrarily selecting some ccps ( out of all that are allowed by calculations ) can have severe consequences .",
    "if we retain @xmath22 from figure  [ fig : fig.3 ] , but theoretically considered only those ccps with an abrupt variation between the two nanomaterials , @xmath79 , then the implications of ( arbitrarily ) narrowing down @xmath23 can be traced by calculating the total degree of conflict between the experimental and theoretical evidence , @xmath51 .",
    "our findings are shown in figure  [ fig : fig.4 ] .",
    "unlike the cases considered in figure  [ fig : fig.2 ] and figure  [ fig : fig.3 ] , where @xmath80 , we see that for the case in figure  [ fig : fig.4 ] , @xmath51 is increased dramatically , to 81@xmath81 .",
    "an interesting and simple example of an arbitrary narrowing of the parameter space can be found when geometric motifs , such as the width of a quantum well , are introduced .",
    "one simply separates one material ( barrier ) from the other ( well ) , basically introducing a sharp variation in ccp [ see @xmath82 and @xmath6 in figure  [ fig : fig.1](c ) and figure  [ fig : fig.4 ] ] .",
    "clearly , a ccp fully describes the structure at this level of representation , so usage of additional geometrical motifs is not necessary .",
    "however , the implications of introducing geometric motifs can be significant .",
    "this approach and analysis are not limited to ii - vi heterointerfaces , but may include e.g. , materials with interfaces between different phases , such as solid - liquid or liquid - gas interfaces  @xcite .",
    "actually , the approach is valid for any nanomaterial - based system for which we do not know ( and can not extract ) the full structure , but can only access partial structural representations via structural characterization and calculations .    by reconciling partial structural representations using _",
    "available _ constraints from experiment / measurements and theory / calculations , we provide _ the upper limit _ of what can be concluded about the structure given these inputs . compared to full structural information , atoms and their positions , the upper limit constructed from partial representations is bounded by uncertainties inherent for structural characterization measurements , and numerical model .",
    "there are both experimental and theoretical benefits of this approach .",
    "_ theoretically _ , the initial parameter space of possible structures can be too large to be tractable , and arbitrarily choosing a region of parameter space might be misleading . by reconciling different possible ccps , i.e. , partial representations , such as those seen by experiment and theory , we maximally exploit the limited amount of data available from experiment , and",
    "determine a range of parameter space where predictive theory can be used to design and optimize the structure .",
    "_ experimentally _ , reconciling partial structural representations using experimental and theoretical is important because it is very difficult ( and certainly not recommended ) to construct a large database from experimental results ( which would require fabrication , characterization , then measurement of properties ) .",
    "even if that were possible , the problem of imprecise structural information could not be eliminated .    , but",
