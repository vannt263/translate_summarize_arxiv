    "branched transportation is a classical problem in optimization : it is a variant of the monge - kantorovich optimal transportation theory in which the transport cost for a mass @xmath7 per unit of length is not linear anymore but sub - additive .",
    "more precisely , the cost to transport a mass @xmath7 on a length @xmath8 is considered to be proportional to @xmath9 for some @xmath100,1[$ ] . as a result , it is more efficient to transport two masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 together instead of transporting them separately . for this reason ,",
    "an optimal pattern for this problem has a `` graph structure '' with branching points .",
    "contrary to what happens in the monge - kantorovich model , in the setting of branched transportation , an optimal structure can not be described only using a transport plan , giving the correspondence between origins and destinations , but we need a model which encodes all the trajectories of mass particles .",
    "+ branched transportation theory is motivated by many structures that can be found in the nature : vessels , trees , river basins ",
    "similarly , as a consequence of the economy of scale , large roads are proportionally cheaper than large ones and it follows that the road and train networks also present this structure . surprisingly the theory has also had theoretical applications : recently , it has been used by f. bethuel in @xcite so as to study the density of smooth maps in sobolev spaces between manifolds .",
    "branched transportation theory was first introduced in the discrete framework by e. n. gilbert in @xcite as a generalization of the steiner problem . in this case",
    "an admissible structure is a weighted graph composed of oriented edges of length @xmath13 on which some mass @xmath14 is flowing .",
    "the cost associated to it is then @xmath15 and it has to be minimized over all graphs which transport some given atomic measure to another one .",
    "more recently , the branched transportation problem was generalized to the continuous framework by q. xia in @xcite by means of a relaxation of the discrete energy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "then , many other models and generalizations have been introduced ( see @xcite for a lagrangian formulation , see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for different generalizations and regularity properties . ) . in this paper , we will concentrate on the model with a divergence constraint , due to q. xia .",
    "however , this is not restrictive since all these models have been proved to be equivalent ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this model ,",
    "a transport path is represented as a vector measure @xmath16 on some open set @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for two probability measures @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "then the energy of @xmath16 is defined as @xmath21 if @xmath16 is a vector measure concentrated on a rectifiable @xmath1-dimensional set @xmath22 on which @xmath16 has multiplicity @xmath23 w.r.t . the hausdorff measure ( see @xcite for more details ) . in this framework , @xmath16 must be considered as the momentum ( the mass @xmath23 times the velocity ) of a particle at some point .",
    "then @xmath24 represents the difference between incoming and outcoming mass at each point @xmath25 .    in this paper , we are interested in some approximation of branched transportation proposed by e. oudet and f. santambrogio few years ago in @xcite and which has interesting numerical applications .",
    "this model was inspired by the well known scalar phase transition model proposed by l. modica and s. mortola in @xcite .",
    "given @xmath26 for some bounded open subset @xmath27 , e. oudet and f. santambrogio introduced the following energy : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are some exponents depending on @xmath31 ( see ) . if @xmath16 does not belong to the set @xmath32 , the value of @xmath2 is taken as @xmath33 .",
    "we recall the heuristic which shows why @xmath2 is an approximation of @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) : assume that @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) is a point source at @xmath34 ( resp .",
    "@xmath35 ) with mass @xmath7 .",
    "then , it is clear that the optimal path for @xmath0 between these two measures is the oriented edge @xmath36 of length @xmath8 with a mass @xmath7 flowing on it .",
    "we would like to approximate this structure , seen as a vector measure @xmath16 concentrated on @xmath37 , by some @xmath3 vector fields @xmath38 which are more or less optimal for @xmath2 .",
    "what we expect is that @xmath38 looks like a convolution of @xmath16 with a kernel @xmath39 depending on @xmath40 and @xmath7 : @xmath41 for some @xmath42 , where @xmath43 for some fixed smooth and compactly supported radial kernel @xmath44 .",
    "then the support of @xmath38 is like a strip of width @xmath45 around @xmath37 so that @xmath46 is of the order of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "this gives an estimate of @xmath50 like @xmath51 with our choice for the exponents @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the optimal choice for @xmath45 is @xmath55 where @xmath56 this finally leads to @xmath57 as expected .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that , at least in two dimensions , the energy sequence @xmath58 @xmath6-converges to the branched transportation functional @xmath59 for some constant @xmath60 and for some suitable topology ( see theorem [ gammaconvergenceoudet ] page ) .",
    "this result has been interestingly applied to produce a numerical method .",
    "however , rather than a @xmath6-convergence result on @xmath61 we would need to deal with the functionals @xmath62 , obtained by adding a divergence constraint : it should be shown that @xmath63 @xmath6-converges to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is some suitable approximation of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the indicator function in the sense of convex analysis that is @xmath68 whenever the condition is satisfied and @xmath33 otherwise .",
    "even if this property was not proved in @xcite , the effectiveness of the numerical simulations made the authors think that it actually holds true .",
    "note that an alternative using a penalization term was proposed in @xcite to overcome this difficulty .",
    "in section [ mathematicalsetting ] we recall xia s formulation of branched transportation and its approximation @xmath2 introduced by e. oudet and f. santambrogio . the longest part of this paper , section [ localestimatesection ] ,",
    "is devoted to a local estimate which gives a bound on the minimum value @xmath69 depending on @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see theorem [ localestimate ] page ) . in section [ comparisonsection ] , we deduce a comparison between @xmath73 and the wasserstein distance with an `` error term '' involving the @xmath4 norm of @xmath74 .",
    "as an application of this inequality , in the last section , we will prove the following @xmath6-convergence result which was lacking in @xcite    [ gammacv ] let @xmath75 be a sequence weakly converging to @xmath76 as measures when @xmath77 .",
