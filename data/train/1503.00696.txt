    "the tunneling effect is peculiar to quantum mechanics and no counterparts exist in classical mechanics .",
    "quantum tunneling plays a role and actually manifests in various situations ranging from atomic and molecular physics to various phenomena in condensed phases .    in most cases , incorporating the tunneling effect into each case",
    "is made by using the system with a single degree of freedom .",
    "this is justified and certainly provides a good description if the tunneling penetration proceeds in only one direction , but this is not the case when the system has multi degrees of freedom .",
    "the most important qualitative difference between one- and multi - dimensional systems would be that classical particles are confined not only by the energy barrier , but also by the _",
    "dynamical barrier_. the latter is formed when additional constants of motion , either globally or locally , exist besides the energy .",
    "what is more crucial is the fact that generic multi - dimensional systems are no more completely integrable and chaos appears in the underlying classical dynamics , so one must take into account new aspects of quantum tunneling absent in completely integrable systems @xcite .",
    "the role of classical chaos in quantum tunneling has first been discussed in the observation of the wave packet dynamics @xcite , and then clearly recognized in the behavior of the tunneling splitting of eigenenergies @xcite . to understand why chaos could play a role in the tunneling process",
    ", it suffices to suppose the states forming a doublet , which is a complete analog of the doublet appearing in the system with one - dimensional symmetric double well potential .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the doublet in multi - dimensional systems are supported by symmetric regular tori in phase space and chaos exists in between .",
    "as one varies an external parameter of the system , it can happen that states forming the doublet and a state supported by the chaotic region come close to each other in the energy space and form avoided crossing .",
    "within the interaction regime , the energy splitting between the doublet becomes large through couplings with the chaotic state , meaning that the tunneling amplitude between one torus to the other is enhanced .",
    "_ chaos - assisted tunneling _ ( cat ) occurs in this way @xcite .",
    "a similar enhancement is known to take place if the doublet is bridged by nonlinear resonances .",
    "nonlinear resonances are also important ingredients in multi - dimensional systems , and the latter mechanism is called _ resonance - assisted tunneling _ ( rat ) @xcite .    in order to go beyond qualitative explanations and to obtain more direct evidence for the connection between chaos ( and/or nonlinear resonances ) semiclassical ( wkb ) analyses",
    "are desired , especially based on the complex classical dynamics since quantum tunneling is a classically forbidden process .    for the system with one degree of freedom , there indeed exists a standard approach that has been established already @xcite .",
    "instanton _ is the name of a complex orbit which conveys the tunneling amplitude running along the imaginary time axis , and the formula representing the tunneling splitting in the symmetric double well mode is expressed as @xmath0 where and classical ingredients @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be deduced in the instanton calculation @xcite .    on the other hand , in multi - dimensional cases , full semiclassical analyses using the complex classical dynamics",
    "could so far be applied only to the time domain @xcite and have not been even formulated except for completely integrable situations in the energy domain @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of tunneling could therefore be well accounted for in terms of the complex dynamics @xcite , but fully convincing semiclassical understanding for the energy domain is still lacking .    the aim of this article is to explore the origin of the enhancement of tunneling probability observed in the energy domain . the tunneling probability in the energy domain is often measured by tracking the energy splitting or the properly defined tunneling rate as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the enhancement is typically observed as plateaus accompanied by spikes due to energy resonance @xcite .",
    "characteristics observed there are understood within a framework of rat , and in particular , plateaus could be interpreted as a kind of phenomena that might be called quantum overlapping resonances ; a bunching of spikes , each of which is associated with an individual quantum resonance , turns out to create plateaus , or a persistent long - range interaction of each resonance with other states @xcite .",
    "however , one should recall that the enhancement occurs even when the planck s constant is not small enough to resolve the chaotic components or nonlinear resonance islands .",
    "this rather paradoxical behavior has been already observed in several models @xcite , but its origin in such a slightly perturbed regime has never been seriously investigated to the authors knowledge .    we here take a close look at the nature of the enhancement of the tunneling probability in such nearly integrable regimes by introducing techniques such as absorbing the individual states involved in avoided crossings and decomposing the eigenstates into proper integrable bases , as explained in detail below .",
    "we especially focus not only on the behavior of the energy levels but also on the nature of eigenfunctions to elucidate which components are mostly responsible for the plateau structure formed in the energy splitting vs @xmath3 plot .    in conjunction with this",
    ", we shall stress the importance of observing wavefunctions in the whole range because there are various ways to define the @xmath4tunneling probability \" , and the nature of tunneling may look different depending on how it is defined . here , for the closed system ( standard map ) the splitting of energy levels will be adopted to measure the tunneling probability , whereas for the open system , like the hnon map , the probability in the asymptotic region is naturally introduced , and the decay rate for the absorbed system is sometimes used",
    ". there would be no legitimate way or one should even say that providing a proper definition of the tunneling probability itself is an issue to be explored in nonintegrable systems .",
    "therefore , one should examine more carefully the tail of wavefunctions in the whole range before focusing on the amplitude at a certain specific position .",
    "the present analysis is motivated by a recent work in which the mechanism of the _ instanton - noninstanton _",
    "( i - ni ) _ transition _ has closely been studied in terms of quantum perturbation theory @xcite , and so spirits and tools for analyses are overall common .",
    "the term instanton - noninstanton ( i - ni ) is named after the first transition at which the deviation from the instanton prediction starts @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the system studied in this paper , and present aspects of the enhancement of the tunneling probability by observing the quantum number and @xmath3 dependence of the tunneling probability in our model . in section [ sec :",
    "staircase ] , introducing an absorbing operator , which projects out a given set of integrable states , we examine which states are responsible for creating spikes typically observed in the splitting curve and whether or not the staircase structure of the splitting curve appears as a result of local quantum resonances in the energy space . in section [ sec : eigenstate ] , we investigate the nature of eigenstates to clarify the mechanism of the enhancement by focusing on the local probability amplitude of eigenfunctions and the contribution spectrum introduced in @xcite . in section [ sec : rat_integ ] , on the basis of analyses made in section [ sec : eigenstate ] we claim that an essential difference of the splitting curve exists between integrable and nonintegrable systems . in the final section ,",

    "in other words , the history of the staircase structure in the splitting plot is properly recoded in the tail of wavefunction , not necessarily at @xmath148 .    the staircase structure in the splitting plot could therefore be explained by the successive switching process of maximal modes , and passing through the separatrix , that is , whether the support of the maximal mode is inside or outside the separatrix .",
    "figure [ fig : contmax_and_splitting ] illustrates that the staircase structure of the splitting curve can be understood by the position of the maximal mode : whether its support is outside or inside the separatrix .",
    "we have verified , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contmax_and_splitting](b ) , that even if we suppress the peak standing on the broad peak components using the same absorber technique in subsection [ subsec : absorbing_operator ] , this switching process still survive .",
    "this implies that the switching does not occur specifically between the resonance peaks appearing in the contribution spectrum , but overall deformation of broad peak components controls it .",
    "we could identify at least the third and fourth transition and confirmed the same scenario applies .      as shown above",

    "this is also reasonable because each @xmath190 has its supports on a transversal invariant torus outside the separatrix , so the connection is not made via tunneling but real classical processes , thus resulting in no decay as a function of the energy .",
    "in contrast , the nature of the eigenfunction @xmath189 in the action representation is highly nontrivial . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : action_rep](a ) , there exists a sharp peak at @xmath196 , which represents the instanton contribution , and then the value of @xmath189 suddenly drops to reach a small level .",

    "a particularly important fact is , as shown in fig [ fig : irep_amp ] , that the decay rate of the height of the non - decaying region as a function of @xmath3 is extremely slow , as compared to the region @xmath199 .",
    "this clearly distinguishes and characterizes the two regions , below and above the resonance energy @xmath197 .",
    "we should make clear the underlying reason behind the observed power law decay in both regions , but the observed energy , so the corresponding classical structure as well , moves with increase in @xmath3 in the current setting , which makes difficult to apply a straightforward semiclassical argument .",

    "as was checked above , the fundamental energy sequence can induce quantum resonances , resulting in the spikes in the splitting curve .",
    "however , it should be noted that the appearance of quantum resonances is not a necessary condition for the presence of the staircase structure , as discussed in the subsection [ subsec : tunnel_splitting ] and [ subsec : i - ni ] . in other words , even if the resonance condition is not satisfied , a broadly spread or mild peak , whose width is almost comparable to the fundamental energy unit @xmath191 , survives around the fundamental energy sequence .",

    "all the features have clearly been accounted for if one applies the semiclassical method using complex paths @xcite .",
    "the spikes appear as a result of the energetic resonance between the states localized in the inner well and outer region .",
    "the coupling strength could be evaluated using the imaginary action of complex trajectories which bridge classical disjointed equi - energy surfaces .",
    "it would be worth mentioning that for @xmath229 the condition @xmath246 can be factorized into @xmath247 and @xmath248 this shows that the invariant curves specified by ( [ eq : ecurve1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ecurve2 ] ) are not connected even in the complex plane , thus no tunneling connection between the inner and outer regions exists even though both are the surfaces with the same energy @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the splitting @xmath47 exhibits single exponential decay without spikes .    on the other hand , with careful observation of the splitting curve for @xmath241 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : jeremy_normal](b ) ) , we notice that there exists a crossover from one slope to another . in a small @xmath3 regime",
    ", the slope can be well fitted by the one for @xmath229 , whereas the best fit curve , colored in gray in fig .",

    "such a crossover or the change of the slope of the splitting curve reminds us of the plateau discussed in the nonintegrable situation .",

    "note here that @xmath236 can be identified with the action coordinate .",
    "the reason for the peak position being fixed is simple ; the peak appears as a result of the coupling between inner and outer surface , which is expected to occur in the rat scenario .",
    "alternatively stated , the origin of coupling is purely classical .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaled_irep_integ ] , the leading - order semiclassical anstaz , which was discussed in the previous section , works quite well for the eigenfunction in the action representation .",
    "these results make a sharp contrast to the standard map case .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : jeremy_hsm ] that the maximal mode in the contribution spectrum well reproduces the structure of eigenfunction around @xmath148 , and its support is exactly an invariant curve with the same energy as that of the ground state .",
    "the presence of the crossover admits a simple semiclassical interpretation . as discussed in @xcite , there exist two different complex paths with different imaginary actions .",
    "one corresponds to the ordinary instanton path , which runs from one well to another directly and the other is the path bypassing the classical resonance chain . in the semiclassical regime , since the latter one has a smaller imaginary action . on the other hand , in a small @xmath251 regime",
    ", it can happen that the instanton contribution is larger than that from the bypassing one , in spite of the magnitude relation of imaginary actions .",
    "this is because the prefactor , more precisely the coupling amplitude due to tunneling , comes into play in a relatively small @xmath3 regime .",
    "the observed crossover would be understood by taking into account not only the imaginary action but the coupling amplitude .",
    "this argument suggests that , in a larger @xmath251 regime , the coupling with bypassing path gets larger , and the crossover point disappears when the value of @xmath251 exceeds a certain threshold .",

    "the focus of the present paper was put on clarifying the origin of the enhancement of tunneling probability in the nearly integrable system .",
    "we here measured the tunneling probability by observing tunneling splittings plotted as a function of the inverse planck s constant .",
    "typical features of the splitting curve commonly observed in nonintegrable quantum maps are the existence of spikes and persistent departure of the splitting curve from the one predicted by the instanton .    so far these have been discussed in the framework of rat theory , but here we took a different perspective : the splitting curve is composed of the staircase - shaped backbone accompanied by spikes .",
    "we have observed that , by introducing the absorber composed of integrable bases , spikes could be selectively suppressed if states interacting with the reference doublet are absorbed .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that the interacting or third state could be decoupled from the reference doublet when we take an integrable state that has maximally overlap with the corresponding eigenstate as the absorber .",
    "the eigenenergy of such eigenstates responsible for generating spikes are pushed out to the complex plane , and spikes disappear .",
    "our observation was that even though all the third states which resonate energetically with the reference doublet are suppressed in such a way the staircase structure survives .",
    "note that the efficiency of the present absorber comes from the fact that the regime we consider is close enough to the integrable limit , otherwise the absorber may affect irrelevant states in an uncontrollable way .",
    "the result strongly suggests the existence of non - trivial broad interaction between the reference doublet and other states .",
    "this was indeed confirmed by introducing renormalized hamiltonian , which is constructed using the bch expansion , and used as basis states by which the reference state is expanded .",
    "in particular , we focus on the contribution spectrum at the origin @xmath148 since the amplitude of eigenfunctions at the origin follows the behavior of tunneling splitting . here",
    "the contribution spectrum introduced in @xcite represents components of renormalized states in the reference state .",
    "the contribution spectrum analysis clearly revealed that , in addition to the self component representing the instanton , there certainly exists broad interaction , and the behavior of such broadly spread components controls the staircase structure in the splitting curve .",
    "there are two key ingredients to explain the emergence of the staircase : one is the behavior of the most dominant state in broad components , the other is anomalous tail observed in the eigenfunction in the action representation .",
    "note that the renormalized bases are crucially important to capture these features , otherwise one could not explain the existence of the staircase structure and the anomalous tail part in the action representation as well .",
    "the dominant contributor in the broadly spread components switches from one to another , which was observed in the contribution spectrum .",
    "such a switching phenomenon is driven by and liked to the existence of the fundamental energy sequence , which is further enhanced when the quantum resonance between unperturbed system and the periodic driving occurs .",
    "the origin of anomalous part in the action representation should be explored more closely , which will become a primary subject of our forthcoming papers . the semiclassical analysis based on the correspondence principle , in which not complex but real classical orbits are used as input information .",
    "this efficiently works and turns out to extract anomalous components in classical dynamics of the bch hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the analogy with the system modeling the diffraction , together with some speculations on anomalous behaviors of caustics appearing in the semiclassical analysis will be another approach @xcite .",
    "the latter suggests that observed phenomena in the eigenfunction in the action representation are beyond the leading semiclassical description .",
    "these two key characteristics are , by their very nature , absent in the completely integrable system .",
    "therefore , one could predict that the staircase structure does not appear in the completely integrable .",
    "we have confirmed this for a normal form hamiltonian system , for which the validity of rat theory was recently investigated .",
    "we have shown that a sharp contrast exists between integrable and nonintegrable systems and verified that the dominant contributor in the contribution spectrum for the integrable system sits at the same position and does not move as in the nonintegrable case .",
    "the absence of the staircase structure could simply be interpreted by the fact that there exists a unique dominant complex path in the semiclassical regime .",
    "finally we would like to emphasize the importance of observing wavefunctions in the whole range , not focusing only on the amplitude at a specific point , like the origin @xmath148 in the present case .",
    "as discussed in subsection [ subsec : i - ni ] , with increase in @xmath3 , the convex structure around the origin , appearing in the first plateau , is pushed outward and forms shoulders in both sides .",
    "the same process happens repeatedly as one further increases @xmath3 , that is , similar shoulders appear one after another . in this sense , we can find the trace of the staircase of the splitting curve in the tail pattern of wavefunction .",
    "this is also true for wavefunction in the action representation .",
    "there exists a significant difference between inner and outer tunneling tail , and this exactly results in different slopes of the splitting curve and thus staircase skeleton .",
    "we are grateful for useful discussions with h. harada , j. le deunff , a. mouchet , t. okushima , and k. takahashi .",
    "we especially thanks to n. mertig for his helpful comments on rat theory .",

    "the authors appreciate shoji tsuji and kankikai for using their facilities at kawaraya during this study .",
    "in the vicinity of the energy corresponding to the unstable fixed point at @xmath84 , the states @xmath56 do not form tunneling doublets , so this numbering rule does not work , but this ambiguity will not cause any serious confusion in the present description ."
