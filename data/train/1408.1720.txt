    "quantum error - correcting codes constitute an indispensable ingredient in the roadmap to fault - tolerant quantum computation as they offer the framework of enabling imperfect quantum gates and resources to implement arbitrarily reliable quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "an essential feature for such codes is to admit a fault - tolerant implementation of a universal gate - set where physical errors should propagate in a benign and controlled manner .",
    "a paragon for fault - tolerant implementation of logical gates is provided by transversal unitary operations , _",
    "i.e. _ single qubit rotations acting independently on each physical qubit .",
    "however , eastin and knill have proved that the set of transversal gates constitutes a finite group , and hence is not universal for quantum computation  @xcite , suggesting a tension between computational power and fault - tolerance .",
    "recently , bravyi and knig have further sharpened this tension for topological stabilizer codes supported on a lattice with geometrically local generators  @xcite . by extending their consideration to logical gates implemented by constant depth local quantum circuits as feasible proxy",
    ", they have shown that , in @xmath0 spatial dimensions , fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates are restricted to a set of unitary gates , known as the @xmath0-th level of the clifford hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "this result establishes a connection between two seemingly unrelated notions ; fault - tolerance and geometric locality .",
    "the result by bravyi and knig ( bk ) is motivated by considerations of topological stabilizer codes , which are also likely to suggest a host of future generalizations . in this paper , we begin to address open questions posed by the work of bravyi and knig .      as in bk  @xcite , the tensor product pauli operators on @xmath6 qubits ( denoted by @xmath7}$ ] ) and the corresponding clifford hierarchy  @xcite will play a central role .",
    "we provide a formal definition for the @xmath1-th level of the clifford hierarchy @xmath8 .",
    "[ def : cliffordhierarchy ] we define the * clifford hierarchy * as @xmath9 ( i.e. global complex phases ) , and then recursively as @xmath10    note that despite using a commutator in place of conjugation , the above definition coincides with the usual one for @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : comparison ] for comparison ) .",
    "@xmath12 is a group of pauli operators with global complex phases .",
    "@xmath13 coincides with the _ clifford group _ and includes the hadamard gate @xmath14 , @xmath15 phase shift and the @xmath16 gate . @xmath17",

    "realistic systems also offer decoherence - free implementation of some clifford gates .",
    "for instance , braiding of ising anyons , that are believed to exist in the fractional quantum hall effect state at filling fraction @xmath23 , implements certain clifford gates with an estimated error - rate being @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is important to fault - tolerantly perform _ non - clifford _ logical gates outside of @xmath22 .",
    "let us now summarize the main contributions of this work .",
    "we begin by providing a self - contained and arguably simpler derivation of bk s result .",
    "we then derive a key technical lemma to assess fault - tolerant implementability of logical gates for both stabilizer and subsystem error - correcting codes ( lemma  [ lemma : hierarchy ] in section  [ sec : review ] ) .",
    "in addition , there are four main original contributions .",
    "below , we provide a preliminary statement of each , deferring a more rigorous treatment to later sections .",
    "first of all , we show that the property of self - correction imposes a further restriction on logical gates implementable by constant depth local circuits .",
    "namely , we find that the assumption of having no string - like logical operators reduces the level of the implementable clifford hierarchy by one with respect to bk s result .    _ * [ self - correction ] * _ if a @xmath0-dimensional stabilizer hamiltonian , consisting of geometrically local terms with bounded norms , has a macroscopic energy barrier , the set of logical gates , admitting a locality - preserving implementation , is restricted to @xmath25 .",
    "this theorem allows us to obtain a new no - go result for self - correcting quantum memory in three spatial dimensions ; a three - dimensional topological stabilizer hamiltonian with a locality - preserving non - clifford gate can not have a macroscopic energy barrier . the proof is presented in section  [ sec : self - correction ] . the result establishes a somewhat surprising connection between ground state properties and excitation energy landscape .",
    "while technically simple , this observation is arguably the most interesting .",
    "our second result concerns a tradeoff between the code distance and locality - preserving implementability of logical gates .",
    "namely , we find that implementability of logical gates from the higher - level clifford hierarchy reduces an upper bound on the code distance of a topological stabilizer code .",
    "_ * [ code distance ] * _ if a stabilizer code with geometrically - local generators in @xmath0 spatial dimensions admits a locality - preserving implementation of a logical gate @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( but @xmath28 ) , then its code distance is upper bounded by @xmath29 .    for a code with a non - clifford gate ( @xmath3 ) , this result improves the previous best bound @xmath30 for topological stabilizer codes  @xcite .",
    "the bound is found to be tight for @xmath4 as bombin s topological color codes saturates it  @xcite . the proof is presented in section  [ sec : self - correction ] .",
    "the theorem also applies to a topological subsystem code if its stabilizer subgroup admits a complete set of geometrically local generators .",
    "such subsystem codes include bombin s topological _ gauge _ color code  @xcite .",
    "our third result relates the loss threshold in stabilizer and subsystem error - correcting codes with the set of transversally implementable logical gates .",

    ".    we would like to emphasize that the above theorem does _ not _ assume geometric locality of generators or lattice structures , and holds for arbitrary stabilizer _ and _ subsystem codes . the proof is presented in section  [ sec : loss ] .      finally , the main technical result is to generalize bk s result to subsystem codes with local generators .",
    "a difficulty is that the so - called union lemma does not apply to a topological subsystem code  @xcite .",
    "minimal supplementary assumptions , such as a finite loss threshold for the code and a logarithmically increasing code distance , are required in order to recover the same thesis as bk s for locality - preserving logical gates .",
    "_ * [ subsystem code ] * _ consider a family of subsystem codes with geometrically local gauge generators in @xmath0 spatial dimensions such that the code has a constant loss threshold and a code distance growing at least logarithmically in the number of physical qubits .",
    "then , any locality - preserving logical unitary , fully supported on an @xmath1-dimensional region ( @xmath33 ) , has a logical action included in @xmath20 .    the proof is presented in section  [ sec : subsystem ] .",
    "supplementary assumptions arise from considerations on fault - tolerance of the code .",
    "a finite loss threshold is necessary for a finite error threshold against depolarization .",
    "a logarithmically increasing code distance is necessary for the recovery failure probability to vanish at least polynomially in the number of physical qubits .",
    "supplementary assumptions are not required for subsystem codes with geometrically local stabilizer generators as the union lemma holds for such codes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : review ] , we provide a definition of subsystem codes and derive a key technical tool to study fault - tolerant implementability of logical gates .",
    "we then provide a derivation of bk s result . in section  [ sec : loss ]",
    ", we derive a tradeoff between the loss - tolerance and transversal implementability of logical gates . in section  [ sec : subsystem ] , we generalize bk s result to topological subsystem codes . in section  [ sec : self - correction ] , we find a restriction on the set of logical gates admitting a locality - preserving implementation arising from self - correction .",
    "we then derive an upper bound on the code distance of topological stabilizer codes .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we review the framework of subsystem error - correcting codes and derive a tool relating fault - tolerant implementability of logical gates and locality ( or non - locality ) of logical gates in multi - partitions",
    ". we also present a qualitative derivation of bk s result for topological stabilizer codes .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of the stabilizer formalism  @xcite .",
    "given the hilbert space of @xmath6 qubits @xmath34 , a pauli stabilizer group @xmath35 is an abelian subgroup of the pauli group on @xmath6 qubits which does not contain @xmath36 .",
    "the codeword space of the stabilizer group @xmath35 is defined to be the subspace @xmath37 of common @xmath38 eigenvectors for stabilizers in @xmath35 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath39 ) .",
    "_ topological _ stabilizer codes are characterized by having their constituent physical qubits laid out on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice , in such a way that the stabilizer group @xmath35 admits a complete set of geometrically local generators @xmath40 ( _ i.e. _ each generator @xmath41 is supported on a ball of constant radius @xmath42 ) . here",
    "@xmath43 is the number of logical qubits encoded in the codeword space @xmath44 when @xmath45 are independent generators . in the present paper , the word _ topological _ refers to quantum error - correcting codes defined on a lattice with geometrically local generators .",
    "ideally , one hopes a logical gate @xmath46 to be implemented by a transversal unitary operation ( _ i.e. _ an operator with a tensor product form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a single qubit rotation acting on @xmath49-th physical qubit ) so that local errors at physical qubits do not propagate to other qubits . for fault - tolerant implementation , it is desirable that a logical gate @xmath46 admits an implementation by a constant - depth quantum circuit in order to avoid uncontrolled error propagations .",
    "ideally , the gates in such a circuit should additionally be geometrically local to simplify their physical realization .",
    "for this reason , it is important to classify logical gates of quantum error - correcting codes admiting such an implementation . in the present paper , the word _",
    "locality - preserving _ refers to a logical unitary operator that can be implemented by a constant - depth geometrically - local circuit . note that stabilizer codes admit",
    "transversal implementation of pauli logical gates in @xmath12 , and css stabilizer codes admit quasi - transverse on all physical qubits implements a @xmath16 gates on all pairs of encoded qubits in the two copies . ]",
    "implementations of certain @xmath16 gate in @xmath13 .",
    "bravyi and knig@xcite consider the set of logical gates that may be realized on a topological stabilizer code with a constant depth local quantum circuit .",
    "their main result is stated as follows :    _ * [ bravyi and knig ] * _ if @xmath46 is a morphism between d - dimensional topological stabilizer codes @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and u is implementable by a constant - depth quantum circuit with short - range gates , then @xmath46 is a @xmath52-morphism for all large enough @xmath53.[thm : bk ]    note that the theorem by bravyi and knig deals with code deformations  @xcite where logical transformations between two different codes @xmath50 and @xmath51 are also considered . in the present paper , we do not deal with code deformations for simplicity of discussion by assuming @xmath54 .",
    "our arguments may be made applicable to the case for @xmath55 with a little effort .",
    "one important aim of the present paper is to generalize bk s result to topological subsystem codes . in this work",
    ", we will refer to subsystem codes to denote the pauli stabilizer formalism , which provide a generalization of stabilizer qeccs to the context of operator quantum error correction formalism  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , a subsystem code is a stabilizer code defined by @xmath35 where we encode quantum information into only a subset of the qubits in the stabilized subspace .",
    "encoded qubits in this subset will be called logical qubit and the remaining qubits will be called gauge qubits ( _ i.e. _ the stabilized subspace may be decomposed into @xmath56 as in fig .",
    "[ fig_subsystem ] ) .",
    "a subsystem code is concisely defined by its gauge group @xmath57 which may be non - abelian and contain @xmath58 ( in contrast to the stabilizer group @xmath35 ) . the stabilizer subgroup",
    "@xmath35 consists of centers of the gauge group @xmath59 ( i.e. elements of @xmath59 that commute with all the elements in @xmath59 ) , and is defined as @xmath60 , where signs are consistently chosen for the operators in the center @xmath61 such that @xmath62 is not included in the group .",
    "this leaves some freedom for @xmath35 associated to the signs of its generators .",
    "the codespace of a subsystem code , denoted by @xmath63 , is stabilized by @xmath35 , and logical qubits are encoded in a subsystem where gauge operators act trivially .",
    "the case @xmath64 corresponds to the special case of stabilizer codes .",
    "one merit of subsystem codes is that the error recovery procedure may admit simpler realizations with measurements on fewer - body pauli operators since it is not necessary to worry about errors affecting gauge qubits  @xcite .",
    "as such , one might expect that imposing locality on such codes could be less restrictive than doing so on stabilizer codes in terms of transversally implementable logical gates .",
    "however , the present work suggests that there is no significant advantage for subsystem codes .     and the stabilizer subgroup @xmath35 in a subsystem code .",
    "the figure illustrates an example with @xmath65 qubits , three gauge qubits and two logical qubits .",
    "@xmath66 is the full pauli algebra for the gauge qubits ( red online ) .",

    "we exclude such unitary operators since the unitary action on the logical qubits is dependent on the state of the gauge qubits .",

    "conjugation by @xmath46 commutes with depolarization with respect to the gauge group .",

    "<S> recently , bravyi and knig have shown that there is a tradeoff between fault - tolerantly implementable logical gates and geometric locality of stabilizer codes . </S>",
    "<S> they consider locality - preserving operations which are implemented by a constant depth geometrically local circuit and are thus fault - tolerant by construction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they shown that , for local stabilizer codes in @xmath0 spatial dimensions , locality preserving gates are restricted to a set of unitary gates known as the @xmath0-th level of the clifford hierarchy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions and applications of their characterization in various directions .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we present a new no - go theorem for self - correcting quantum memory . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we prove that a three - dimensional stabilizer hamiltonian with a locality - preserving implementation of a non - clifford gate can not have a macroscopic energy barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that in haah s cubic code and michnicki s welded code non - clifford gates do not admit such an implementation .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we prove that the code distance of a @xmath0-dimensional local stabilizer code with non - trivial locality - preserving @xmath1-th level clifford logical gate is upper bounded by @xmath2 . for codes with non - clifford gates ( @xmath3 ) , this improves the previous best bound by bravyi and terhal . </S>",
    "<S> bombin s topological color codes saturate the bound for @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> third we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with non - trivial transversal @xmath1-th level clifford logical gate is upper bounded by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> as such , no family of fault - tolerant codes with transversal gates in increasing level of the clifford hierarchy may exist . </S>",
    "<S> this result applies to arbitrary stabilizer and subsystem codes , and is not restricted to geometrically - local codes .    </S>",
    "<S> fourth we extend the result of bravyi and knig to subsystem codes . </S>",
    "<S> a technical difficulty is that , unlike stabilizer codes , the so - called union lemma does not apply to subsystem codes . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is avoided by assuming the presence of error threshold in a subsystem code , and the same conclusion as bravyi - knig is recovered . </S>"
