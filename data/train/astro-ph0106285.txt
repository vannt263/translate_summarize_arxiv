    "( 1994 ; 1995 ) have suggested that the same gas gives rise to both the x - ray and uv absorption , the spectral complexity of the uv and x - ray absorbers indicates that a wide range of physical conditions are present .",
    "multiple kinematic components with differing physical conditions are seen in both the uv ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and in the x - ray ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the short wavelength response ( 9121187  ) of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ) enables us to make high - resolution spectral measurements ( @xmath5 ) of the high - ionization ion o  vi and the high - order lyman lines of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the o  vi  doublet is a crucial link for establishing a connection between the higher ionization absorption edges seen in the x - ray and the lower ionization absorption lines seen in earlier uv observations .",
    "the high - order lyman lines provide a better constraint on the total neutral hydrogen column density than ly@xmath4 alone .",
    "lower ionization species such as c  iii and n  iii also have strong resonance lines in the  band , and these often are useful for setting constraints on the ionization level of any detected absorption .",
    "the lyman and werner bands of molecular hydrogen also fall in the  band , and we have serached for intrinsic @xmath6 absorption that may be associated with the obscuring torus .",
    "we have been conducting a survey of the @xmath7 brightest agn using _",
    "fuse_. to date ( march 1 , 2001 ) we have observed a total of 57 ; of these , 34 have @xmath1 , so that the o  vi doublet is visible in the fuse band . in this presentation",

    "none show @xmath6 absorption .",
    "i d first like to review the spectral morphology of the o  vi  absorption features .",
    "we see three basic morphologies : ( 1 ) * blend * : multiple o  vi  absorption components that are blended together .",
    "this is the most common morphology ( 8 of 16 objects fall in this class ) , and the spectrum of mrk  509 shown in figure  1 illustrates the typical appearance .",
    "( 2 ) * single * : single , narrow , isolated o  vi  absorption lines , as illustrated by the spectrum of ton  s180 in figure 2 .",
    "( 3 ) * smooth * : this is an extreme expression of the  blend \" class , where the o  vi  absorption is so broad and blended that individual o  vi  components can not be identified .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  4151 shown in figure  3 is typical of this class .",
    "( note , however , that both broad smooth absorption as well as discrete components are often visible in this class . )",
    "as shown in the summary of characteristics presented in table  1 , individual o  vi  absorption components have fwhm of 50750 , with most objects having fwhm @xmath8 .",

    "1 we make a detailed comparison to these uv and x - ray absorption studies .",
    "we can summarize this comparison in two ways : ( 1 ) all objects that have shown previous evidence of either uv or x - ray absorption also show o  vi  absorption in our  observations ; ( 2 ) of those objects showing detectable o  vi  absoption that also have previous uv or x - ray observations available , only 3 do not show x - ray absorption or longer - wavelength uv absorption .",
    "these three exceptions deserve some attention :    * ton s180 * was observed simultaneously with , , and   ( @xcite ) . as shown in figure 2 , the absorption features observed with  are quite weak . at the resolution of the  observations , which used the stis low - resolution gratings , corresponding  and  absorption would not be expected to be detectable .",
    "no x - ray absorption features are seen in the  grating observation , which implies that either the total column density of the absorbing gas is very low , and/or that its ionization state is lower than that necessary to create x - ray absorbing species .    *",
    "mrk 478 * was observed previously with  using the fos . as for ton  s180 ,",
    "these observations were low spectral resolution , so that weak  or  absorption at the equivalent widths observed for o  vi   would not be detectable .",
    "* mrk 279 * shows strong ly@xmath4 absorption in an archival  spectrum .",
    "however , the  observation of mrk  279 does not show evidence of a warm absorber ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was a short observation , however , and total column densities of @xmath12 could easily be present , which would be detectable in  grating observations .",
    "the multiple kinematic components frequently seen in the uv absorption spectra of agn clearly show that the absorbing medium is complex , with separate uv and x - ray dominant zones . in some cases",
    ", the uv absorption component corresponding to the x - ray warm absorber can be clearly identified ( e.g. , mrk  509 , kriss et al . 2000 ) . in others , however , _ no _ uv absorption component shows physical conditions characteristic of those seen in the x - ray absorber ( ngc  3783 : kaiser et al .",
    "2001 ; ngc  5548 : brotherton et al .",
    "one potential geometry for this complex absorbing structure is high density , low column uv - absorbing clouds embedded in a low density , high ionization medium that dominates the x - ray absorption . as discussed by krolik & kriss ( 1995 ; 2001 ) ,",
    "this is possibly a wind driven off the obscuring torus . at the critical ionization parameter for evaporation ,",
    "there is a broad range of temperatures that can coexist in equilibrium at nearly constant pressure ; for this reason , the flow is expected to be strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "what would this look like in reality ?",
    "we will not soon get a close - up look at this aspect of an agn , so it is instructive to look at nearby analogies .",
    "the hst images of the pillars of gas in the eagle nebula , m16 , show the wealth of detailed structure in gas evaporated from a molecular cloud by the uv radiation of nearby newly formed stars ( hester et al .",
    "1996 ) . in an agn",
    "one might expect a dense molecular torus to be surrounded by blobs , wisps , and filaments of gas at various densities .",
    "it is plausible that the multiple uv absorption lines seen in agn with warm absorbers are caused by high - density blobs of gas embedded in a hotter , more tenuous , surrounding medium , which is itself responsible for the x - ray absorption .",
    "higher density blobs would have lower ionization parameters , and their small size would account for the low overall column densities .    in summary , we find that o  vi  absorption is common in low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) agn .",
    "16 of 34 agn observed using  show multiple , blended o  vi  absorption lines with typical widths of @xmath13 that are blueshifted over a velocity range of @xmath14 1000 . with three exceptions ,",
    "those galaxies in our sample with existing x - ray or longer wavelength uv observations also show c  iv absorption and evidence of a soft x - ray warm absorber .",
    "in some cases , a uv absorption component has physical properties similar to the x - ray absorbing gas , but in others there is no clear physical correspondence between the uv and x - ray absorbing components ."
