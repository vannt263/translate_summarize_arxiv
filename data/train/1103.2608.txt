    "we propose new connections between the pauli graphs @xcite , that encode the commutation relations of qudit observables , and prime number theory .",
    "we already emphasized that the dedekind psi function @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 a prime ) is used to count the number of maximal commuting sets of the qudits @xcite and meets the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) at primorial numbers @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "similarly , there exist striking connections between @xmath26 and the hardy - littlewood function @xmath27 for the goldbach distribution of prime pairs [ see sec . 3 for the definition of @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , we observe that @xmath26 meets the so - called totally goldbach numbers at small @xmath3 s and that @xmath29 also meets rh at primorial numbers .",
    "the euler constant @xmath30 , through the mertens formula @xmath31 , is an important ingredient of all the inequalities involved in this correspondence .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we report on the number theoretical _ coincidence _ between @xmath26 and the totally goldbach numbers at small @xmath3 s , as well on the already known theorem connecting @xmath26 and rh at primorial numbers @xmath18 . in section 2",
    ", we explore in detail this coincidence by refering to the qudit pauli graphs .",
    "then , in section 3 , we establish the connection between @xmath32 and rh at primorial numbers . in the discussion , the concept of a goldbach defect for encompassing the statements at low and high @xmath3 s is proposed .",
    "let us start the exposition of our ideas with a few theorems and definitions .",
    "goldbach s conjecture , formulated in 1742 , is that every even integer greater than @xmath33 is the sum of two primes .",
    "to date it has been checked for @xmath3 up to @xmath34 @xcite . a pair ( @xmath35 ) of primes such that the even integer @xmath36 is called a golbach partition .    * definition 1 : * a positive integer @xmath16 is _ totally goldbach _ if for all primes @xmath15 , with @xmath9 not dividing @xmath16 ( except when @xmath37 ) we have that @xmath17 is prime @xcite .",
    "* theorem 1 : * the inequality @xmath10 is only satisfied at a totally goldbach number @xmath12 .",
    "the only totally goldbach numbers not satisfying the inequality are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "* proof : * the proof of theorem 1 follows from a combination of results in @xcite and @xcite ( for a more general setting , see @xcite )",
    ".    * definition 2 : * a positive integer @xmath16 is _ almost totally goldbach _ of index @xmath40 if for all primes @xmath15 , with @xmath9 not dividing @xmath16 ( except when @xmath37 ) we have that @xmath17 is prime with @xmath40 exceptions .",

    "corollary 1 : * the primorial numbers @xmath18 are champion numbers , i.e. left to right maxima of the function @xmath51 .",
    "one gets @xmath52 .",
    "* proof : * according to @xcite , p. 90 , or @xcite ,",
    ", the number of goldbach pairs is such that there exists a constant @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "using the same method than the one used in @xcite for the champions of @xmath55 one gets @xmath56 .",

    "now we prove that conjecture 1 follows from riemann hypothesis .",

    "* theorem 3 ( b ) ) this is dominated by @xmath71 hence , by ( [ loggf ] ) @xmath72 and the inequality ( [ gf ] ) follows .",
    "then , by using the same reasoning that in @xcite , conjecture 1 follows from the inequality @xmath73 by observing that @xmath74 this completes the proof of theorem 5 .",
    "it is useful to encapsulate some of the results obtained for goldbach pairs at small even dimensions and at primorial dimensions by introducing a measure that we denote the goldbach defect .    *",
    "definition 6 : * for a positive even integer @xmath3 , one defines a goldbach defect @xmath75 from the relation @xmath76 .    * result 4 : * the champions of the function @xmath75 ( the numbers at which @xmath75 reaches a new record ) form the sequence    @xmath77    the sequence @xmath78 is found to be a subset of the champions of the cototient function ( a051953 in sloane s encyclopedia ) . by its definition , sequence @xmath78 encompasses the even totally goldbach numbers , except for the number @xmath79 ( see definition 1 ) and the primorial numbers ( see conjecture 1 and corollary 1 )",

    "the cardinality of maximal commuting sets for this case decomposes as @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 .    in conclusion , we found a cornerstone between the arithmetic of qudits , the goldbach pairs and riemann hypothesis .",
    "it may be that the loss of coherence of a classical system , in comparison to a quantum system , crucially depends on its high dimensionality .",
    "the inequalities of theorem 2 and 4 would serve to define an entropy .",
