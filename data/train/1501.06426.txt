    "forthcoming heavy ion experiments , such as the planned cbm experiment at fair will explore the qcd phase diagram in the high density and moderately high temperature region .",
    "this region is very interesting since it is believed that the critical endpoint ( cep )  which separates the crossover and first order phase transition regions along the phase boundary  if it exists , should be found there .",
    "earlier experiments such as rhic , sps , or lhc investigated the low density , high temperature region .",
    "no sign of the chiral phase transition has been observed experimentally , which is not so surprising considering that the phase transition is of crossover type there , which is very hard to observe experimentally .",
    "theoretically , if the transition is of first order  and the system is infinite ",
    "certain quantities have discontinuities crossing the phase boundary , which gives a much higher chance to observe it .",
    "although , since in real physical experiments the system is always finite , there will not be any observable discontinuities , but just peaks .",
    "due to the difficulties of the observation it is very important to gather as much theoretical information as possible from the phase boundary , in order to assist future experiments . according to that",
    ", we would like to investigate the chiral phase transition in the framework of a ( axial)vector meson extended linear sigma model with additional constituent quarks and polyakov loops .",

    "this is because in the present approach the masses used in the parametrization are the curvature masses which are the second derivatives of the grand canonical potential with respect to the meson fields at the minimum .",
    "the curvature masses consist of two parts : a usual tree - level part , which can be found in @xcite , and the vacuum and thermal contributions of the one - loop fermion potential ( bosonic fluctuations are neglected ) .",

    "it is important to note , that in the scalar sector there are more physical particles than we can describe with one @xmath38 nonet , as in nature there are two @xmath39 , two @xmath40 and five @xmath41 particles ( see @xcite ) . since in one scalar nonet",

    "we apply two different parametrization scenarios here . in the first one we do not fit the very uncertain isoscalars ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) ,",
