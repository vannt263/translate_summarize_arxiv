    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze , @xcite ) , inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background off hot electrons , provides a unique probe of the intracluster medium ( for reviews see @xcite ) . for the gas with given electron",
    "density @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 at redshift @xmath2 , surface brightness of the thermal sze is proportional to the line - of - sight integral of electron density times temperature , @xmath3 , whereas that of the x - ray thermal bremsstrahlung emission is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the relative significance of the sze over the x - ray emission thus increases with redshift and electron temperature .",
    "this makes the sze a powerful tool in detecting the shocks and the hot gas associated with violent cluster mergers ( @xcite ) , the frequency of which is expected to increase at high redshifts when the growth of cosmic structures was faster than today .    as of today , however , spatial resolutions of the majority of the sze images are at arcminute scales with a limited number of exceptions ( komatsu et al . 1999 , 2001 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is largely due to the low surface brightness of the sze and a small number of radio telescopes with sub - arcminute resolution in the range of wavelengths relevant to the sze measurements .",
    "controlling systematics of such large telescopes to the sensitivity level required for the sze imaging is also challenging .",
    "interferometers are therefore a promising and complementary tool for high sensitivity sze imaging observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since it measures synchronized and correlated signals among different telescopes , an interferometer has a much better control of systematic noise , e.g. , from the atmosphere",
    ". the obtained data also span a wide range of spatial scales , making it possible to separate point - like sources from the sze . on the other hand",
    ", it often has a limited field - of - view of @xmath5 in the millimeter / submillimeter bands and requires a large number of pointings ( or mosaics ) to uncover the bulk of the cluster emission that extends over several arcminutes .",
    "the sensitivity also varies with spatial scales depending on observing conditions such as array configuration .",
    "addition of single - dish data further improves the sensitivity for extended sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is hence not always easy to know a priori to what extent a specific interferometer can be used to image the sze within a realistic observing time .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the feasibility of sze imaging observations by the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "alma will consist of at least 66 antennas , designed to operate at photon frequencies between @xmath6 ghz and @xmath7 ghz .",
    "a major array of 12-meter antennas will be combined with the atacama compact array ( aca , @xcite ) made up of 7-meter antennas and 12-meter single - dish antennas to improve the spatial frequency coverage and the total power measurement . while the inclusion of aca should greatly enhance the capability of alma in observing extended sources , the practical feasibility and how to optimize it with such heterogeneous arrays in real observations are not straightforward and certainly depend on the nature of the target .",
    "we thus perform detailed imaging simulations of the sze observations with alma including aca using their latest configurations ( see @xcite for earlier imaging simulations of different targets ) .",
    "we pay particular attention to resolving the shock structures of distant merging clusters that are relatively compact and hence suit the field - of - view of alma .",
    "we take the so - called bullet cluster , 1e 0657 - 558 at @xmath8 , as a representative example and perform mock observations using snap shots of state - of - the - art numerical simulations for this cluster @xcite .",
    "1e 0657 - 558 is well known for its prominent bow shock observed by chandra @xcite with the inferred mach number of @xmath9 and the shock velocity of @xmath10 km s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed frequently via the sze ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature or the energy distribution of the shocked electrons , however , is still poorly constrained even for this well - observed cluster because of the lack of sensitivity of current x - ray and sze detectors .",
    "we will show that alma is a powerful instrument capable of resolving a merger shock structure of galaxy clusters at high redshifts and improving our understanding of cluster evolution .    throughout the paper , we assume a standard set of cosmological parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in this cosmology , an angular size of 1@xmath15 corresponds to a physical size of 4.4 kpc and 8.1 kpc at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the imaging simulations are performed using the miriad software ( @xcite ) , version 4.2.3 . following the currently planned specifications of alma",
    ", we consider an array made up of fifty 12-meter antennas ( hereafter 12m@xmath1850 ) and aca made up of twelve 7-meter antennas ( hereafter 7m@xmath1812 ) and four 12-meter single - dish antennas ( hereafter sd@xmath184 ) .",
    "a summary of telescope specifications are given in table [ tab - telesc ] .",
    "to maximize the sensitivity for the extended signals , the most compact array configurations , shown in figure [ fig - antenna ] , are adopted for 12m@xmath1850 and 7m@xmath1812 .",
    "the simulations are performed at 90ghz , which is the lowest frequency ( and hence has the largest field - of - views and the lowest system temperature ) in the initially planned specifications of alma .",
    "this frequency is also expected to be an optimal choice for the sze observation owing to the minimal contamination by synchrotron and dust emissions .",
