    "a consistent approach to describe these correlations employs a bare nucleon - nucleon interaction whose parameters are fitted so as to reproduce the experimental phase shifts ( like the @xmath0 argonne potential ) , and includes medium polarization effects .",
    "the exchange of vibrations between nucleons moving in time reversal states lying close to the fermi energy has been shown to account in both stable and halo nuclei for a consistent fraction of the pairing gap and of the two - nucleon separation energy @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the coupling of nucleons and vibrations renormalizes in an important way the single - particle properties of atomic nuclei , leading to changes in the level densities at the fermi energy and to a breaking of single particle strength ( dynamical shell model @xcite ) . as a rule",
    ", the dynamical shell model phenomena are simply parametrized in terms of an effective mass and of spectroscopic factors . in this paper",
    "we follow the rule and concentrate on the detailed study of the spatial dependence of the pairing field , without pretending to achieve a precise estimate of the value of the pairing gap and of the condensation energy .",
    "we plan to come back to the issue in a future publication , taking the variety of medium polarization effects into account in a self - consistent and unified way within the framework of the approach employed in @xcite , based on the solution of the nambu - gorkov equations and using renormalized qrpa phonons to describe the collective modes .",

    "the coherence length is a few times larger than the nuclear radius .",
    "consequently a simple local density approximation , based on the results obtained in uniform matter , is not expected to lead to accurate results in the case of the finite system .",
    "the fact that the wavefunction of the cooper pair is largely independent of the nuclear interaction , being dominated by the spatial dependence of a few orbitals lying around the fermi surface , testifies to this expectation .",
