    "in his seminal work on the vertical structure of the galaxy , @xcite introduced a method to determine the gravitational force perpendicular to the galactic plane ( the vertical force ) near the sun from stellar kinematics .",
    "though oort s main interest was in developing a dynamical model for the galaxy , he recognized that a measurement of the vertical force as a function of distance from the midplane could be combined with estimates of the density in visible matter to infer the existence of unseen `` dark matter '' . to be sure , his concept of dark matter was not what it is today .",
    "nevertheless , the _ oort problem _ , as efforts to determine the vertical structure of the milky way have come to be known , provides our best astrophysical handle on the _ local _ density of dark matter .",
    "the oort problem relies on astrometric observations of stars that act as tracers of the gravitational potential .",
    "a key assumption is that the tracers are in dynamical equilibrium with respect to their vertical motions @xcite ; for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "this assumption is plausible since a typical star will have completed many oscillations through the galactic midplane over its lifetime .",
    "the discoveries of bulk vertical motions in the stellar disc @xcite and a north - south asymmetry in the number counts of solar neighbourhood stars @xcite call into question this assumption .",
    "in particular , the bulk motion observations imply that the disc is undergoing compression and expansion perpendicular to the midplane , in essence , a localized breathing mode . depending on its phase ,",
    "the breathing mode may manifest itself as a correlation between the mean vertical velocity of the tracers and distance from the midplane .",
    "indeed , the observations mentioned above suggest that variations in the mean velocity with @xmath4 are of order @xmath5 .",
    "perturbations of this type can be caused by the passage of a globular cluster , dwarf galaxy , or dark matter sub - halo through the disc plane @xcite or by gravitational effects of a passing spiral arm @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the impact of a breathing mode perturbation on efforts to determine the local vertical force and dark matter density .",
    "if the entire stellar disc participates in a breathing mode , then the surface density of stars within a particular distance from the galactic midplane , and therefore the vertical force , will change with time . furthermore ,",
    "if a tracer population participates in a breathing mode , then models that treat it as an equilibrium system will yield erroneous results for the inferred vertical force .",
    "it is common practice to use @xmath6 , the magnitude of the vertical force @xmath7 above and below midplane of the disk at the sun s position , as a dynamical constraint on the structure of the galaxy .",
    "much closer to the midplane and baryons will dominate the vertical gravitational force . much further from the midplane and halo stars",
    "will contaminate the sample of tracers . as we will see , a breathing mode perturbation that is consistent with the observed bulk motions changes @xmath6 by only @xmath8 .",
    "one the other hand , the errors induced in estimates of @xmath6 by using a similarly perturbed tracer population can be @xmath9 or greater .    the usual strategy in the oort problem is to find a solution to the time - independent collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) that is consistent with kinematic data for the tracers .",
    "the analysis is particularly simple when one assumes not only that the tracers are in equilibrium , but that variations across the disc plane in the gravitation potential and tracer distribution function ( df ) can be ignored and that the tracers are isothermal with respect to their vertical velocities .",
    "the first of these assumptions implies that the gravitational potential @xmath10 depends only on the total surface density within a distance @xmath4 of the midplane .",
    "that is @xmath11 where @xmath1 is the magnitude of the vertical acceleration and @xmath12 is the total surface density between @xmath13 and @xmath4 .",
    "the second assumption implies that the vertical velocity dispersion @xmath14 of the tracers is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "with these two assumptions , the cbe , or alternatively , the jeans equation perpendicular to the disc , together with the poisson equation , imply that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number density of tracers .",
    "the effects of variations across the disc plane in both the gravitational potential and tracer df are often viewed as corrections to the plane - symmetric cbe , jeans , and poisson equations .",
    "@xcite proposed a more rigorous method to model the full gravitational potential .",
    "the starting point in their analysis is to sort stars into subpopulations selected for their helium and iron abundance ratios .",
    "these mono - abundant subpopulations ( maps ) are treated as independent tracers of the gravitational potential and modeled by the three - integral , quasi - isothermal df of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analysis provides an estimate for the surface density and gravitational potential as a function of @xmath4 and galactocentric cylindrical radius @xmath17 .",
    "the expectation in @xcite is that all maps lead to the same inferred gravitational potential within the model uncertainties . in this paper",
    ", we explore the converse , namely that variations in the inferred force with @xmath14 may reveal the presence of a breathing mode perturbation .",
    "we take the basic idea of using maps from @xcite , but restrict our analysis to the local neighborhood , where the only variation is in the vertical direction .",
    "so , our maps are distinguished solely by their different velocity dispersions , @xmath14 .",
    "we begin in  2 with some preliminaries and two one - dimensional models for a local patch of the galaxy .",
    "the more realistic of these contains a stellar disc , a dark halo , and a set isothermal tracer subpopulations , which are perturbed by a breathing mode . in  3 ,",
    "we analyze mock catalogs generated from this model and infer the parameters of the underlying potential and vertical force .",
    "this analysis allows us to quantify the systematic errors that arise when the tracers are not in equilibrium . in section  4 , we argue that breathing mode perturbations may lead to variations of the inferred @xmath18 with @xmath14 , which may be detectable with data from the gaia mission @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe one - dimensional , plane - symmetric models for a local patch of the galaxy .",
    "we assume that vertical motions decouple from motions in the disc plane and that gradients in the plane of all physical quantities can be ignored .",
    "the models assume a collisionless tracer population that responds to the gravitational potential .",
    "the tracer population is described by a df @xmath19 that satisfies the one - dimensional cbe @xmath20 where @xmath21 is determined by the dominant local constituents through the poisson equation @xmath22 for an equilibrium system , all quantities are time - independent and symmetric under @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , @xmath24 is a function solely of the vertical energy @xmath25 .",
    "tracers follow closed orbits in the @xmath26-plane with period @xmath27 and angular velocity @xmath28 .",
    "we can then replace @xmath4 and @xmath29 by the canonical coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "in general , it is simpler to introduce and analyze perturbations in terms of these coordinates @xcite .    for a system close to equilibrium",
    ", we can write @xmath33 .",
    "likewise , the gravitational potential is perturbed to @xmath34 . in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,",
    "the cbe becomes @xmath35 the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be written as fourier series in @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath38 and @xmath39 doing so leads to a simple physical interpretation for the perturbed system .",
    "for example , the @xmath40 terms correspond to a local bending of the disc and oscillations in @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "likewise , the @xmath43 terms correspond to localized compression and expansion and oscillations in @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the latter are the breathing modes considered in this paper .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite considered self - gravitating systems in which the density that appears on the right - hand side of the poisson equation was given by the integral of the distribution function over velocities .",
    "they found that the system could support true linear modes as well as landau - damped perturbations . in the next subsection , we consider the mathematically simpler problem of a system of massless tracers responding to an external , time - dependent perturbation . in ",
    "2.3 , we allow for a system of stars that both respond to and generate the time - dependent potential .",
    "for our first example we consider a two - component model where spatially homogeneous matter ( here the dark matter ) generates the potential and a single tracer responds to it .",
    "this model is simple enough that it can be analyzed analytically and many of the lessons learned carry over to the more complex model in the next subsection .    the matter distribution is assumed to depend on time leading to a potential @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant .",
    "the @xmath49 dependence is fairly robust since it arises as the leading term in the taylor expansion of a general axisymmetric potential @xmath50 under the assumptions that @xmath21 and its first derivatives are continuous and that variations in @xmath17 are small compared to those in @xmath4 .",
    "as we will see , the @xmath49-dependence induces a breathing mode perturbation in the stellar df .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we assume @xmath51 . in the unperturbed case ( @xmath52 )",
    "all particles have the same period @xmath53 .",
    "( for reference , the total density in the solar neighbourhood is @xmath54 , which implies a vertical oscillation period for stars near the midplane of @xmath55 . )",
    "the transformation between @xmath26 and @xmath56 is then given by @xmath57 and we can write the potential perturbation in eq.[eq : potpert ] as @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath59 which suggests the ansatz @xmath60 where it is understood that we take the real part in these expressions . from eq.[eq : perturbedcbe ] we find @xmath61 finally , after some algebra , we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65    consider a sample of @xmath66 tracer stars with measured phase space coordinates @xmath67 . for definiteness , we assume that the equilibrium tracer population is isothermal with df @xmath68 a hypothetical observer who models these stars as an equilibrium distribution with @xmath69 will calculate the log - likelihood function to be    @xmath70    the observer therefore calculates the best - fit values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 by maximizing the likelihood .",
    "carrying out the derivatives with respect to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , setting both equal to zero , and solving the two coupled equations leads to the estimators for the velocity dispersion @xmath73 and the frequency @xmath74 therefore , the estimator for the density would be @xmath75 eqs .",
    "17 , 18 , and 19 are of course incorrect since the data is not described by the model .",
    "the true relationships between the model parameters and ensemble averages are @xmath76 and @xmath77 meanwhile , @xmath78 .",
    "the inferred value of the dark matter density will differ from the true one by a factor @xmath79 as expected , the error is of order the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "note that this is actually an under - estimate for how poorly the dark matter density can be recovered . in more realistic models ,",
    "the dark matter is one of several components that contributes to the potential and the inference about dark matter density is even less secure .",
    "we now introduce a more realistic model that will serve as a testing bed for the analyses in subsequent sections . here , the components are :    * * dark matter : * this maintains a fixed profile contributing a factor proportional to @xmath49 in the potential . *",
    "* stellar disc : * the unperturbed density is taken to be @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the surface density .",
    "this component also contributes to the potential and is perturbed when the potential is perturbed . *",
    "* tracers : * this component comprises a series of isothermal stellar subpopulations distinguished by their velocity dispersion @xmath14 .",
    "they participate in the perturbation but do not contribute to the potential .",
    "the total equilibrium gravitational potential is therefore @xmath82    [ fig : phspacedf ]   for the equilibrium models described in section 2.3 .",
    "the upper panel shows the dfs for the disc stars ( solid black ) , and tracer populations with @xmath83 ( dotted blue ) , @xmath84 ( dashed magenta ) and @xmath85 ( long - dashed red ) .",
    "the normalization of the tracer dfs is arbitrary and for comparison purposes , we ve set it to match that of the disc stars at @xmath86 .",
    "the lower panel shows the vertical oscillation period as a function of energy.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ fig : rhovdisp ]   for the equilibrium model described in section 2.3 .",

    "the lower panel shows the velocity dispersion .",
    "line types and colours are the same as in figure 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this form for the potential was introduced by @xcite in their series of papers on the oort problem .",
    "we choose parameters to roughly match the stellar density in the solar neighborhood .",
    "in particular , we set @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which yields a vertical density profile in good agreement with the vertical density profile from @xcite .",
    "note that ratio of the contribution to the vertical force from the dark matter to that of the baryons from the stellar disc is @xmath91 , which implies that at @xmath92 , the dark matter accounts for roughly @xmath93 of the total vertical force .",
    "thus , a @xmath94 systematic error in @xmath6 would imply a @xmath95 error in the inferred dark matter density .    in appendix",
    "a , we derive an analytic expression for the distribution function of isothermal tracers embedded in this zero order potential .",
    "figure 1 shows the equilibrium dfs for the stellar component and for three of the tracer subpopulations . note that while the tracer dfs decrease exponentially with @xmath30 , the df for the stellar disc decreases as a power - law with @xmath30 as @xmath96 , a result of the power - law decrease in the density profile at large @xmath4 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "also shown is the vertical oscillation period , which increases from @xmath97 near to the midplane , to @xmath98 at @xmath99 .",
    "figure 2 shows the vertical density and velocity dispersion profiles for the three stellar systems . in principle , the disc stars could be represented as a superposition of isothermal populations .",
    "we then assume that the dfs of the tracers and the stellar disc are perturbed as in eq .",
    "[ eq : dfpert ] , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 . with these choices @xmath44 and @xmath102 are initially equal to their equilibrium values while @xmath103 .",
    "the latter is consistent with measurements of the bulk vertical velocities in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "this perturbation then feeds back into the potential of the stellar disc the system is evolved using an n - body code in which the disc stars and tracers are modeled as plane symmetric sheets ( one - dimensional `` particles '' ) that interact via gravity ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "gravity in a plane - symmetric system is particularly simple since the force on a given particle at position @xmath104 is proportional to the difference between the number of particles with @xmath105 and the number with @xmath106 .",
    "thus , forces at each timestep can be obtained by sorting the particles in @xmath4 .",
    "the stellar disc is modeled with @xmath107 particles .",
    "for the tracers , we note that the stellar surface density at the position of the sun is @xmath108 , which implies that a local patch of the disc @xmath109 across will contain some @xmath110 stars .",
    "the gaia mission @xcite aims to provide kinematic data for a large fraction of these stars .",
    "one might then imagine dividing these stars into @xmath111 subpopulations that are defined by chemical abundances as in @xcite .",
    "each of these subpopulations can then be used as an independent , isothermal tracer of the gravitational potential . with these numbers in mind , we model each of the tracer subpopulations with @xmath112 particles .    in figure 3",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath44 , @xmath102 , and @xmath46 in the presence of the perturbation .",
    "the general features of the oscillations are easy to understand .",
    "first , the vertical oscillations for the coldest tracers ( @xmath113 ) have a period @xmath114 .",
    "as expected for an @xmath43 breathing mode , this is half the vertical oscillation period for a typical star in this subpopulation ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the oscillation periods for the @xmath115 and @xmath85 subpopulations are somewhat longer , consistent with the fact that these populations are comprised of stars with higher vertical energies and therefore longer oscillation periods .",
    "the oscillations damp due to phase mixing and the damping is strongest for the coldest population where the dynamical time is shortest .",
    "we conclude that _ the amplitude and phase of vertical oscillations in different subpopulations need not be the same . _    [ fig : timeevol ]   and @xmath29 as well as @xmath116 for three subpopulations .",
    "the top panel shows the variance in @xmath4 normalized to the equilibrium value for @xmath117 .",

    "the middle panel shows the same for @xmath29 .",

    "3.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure 4 we show the time evolution of the surface density within @xmath7 as well as an estimator for the vertical force @xmath119 .",
    "we see that the amplitude of the oscillations in the former are an order of magnitude smaller than those of the latter .",
    "thus errors in estimates of the local vertical force that arise when the tracers are out of equilibrium are likely to be far more significant than oscillations in the force itself .",

    "in this section , we treat kinematic snapshots of the simulation described in  2.3 as mock data that can be analysed to infer the gravitational potential and force .",

    "we investigate the extent to which the equilibrium assumption will _ bias _ the parameters of the potentials , that is , the amount by which the parameters are mis - estimated when the true distribution has a non - equilibrium signature as described in  2 .",
    "figure 5 shows the model pdfs that are inferred from two mock data sets for the @xmath125 tracer subpopulation .",
    "the first data set is drawn from an equilibrium distribution while the second is drawn from the @xmath126 snapshot of the simulation . as expected , when the data is drawn from an equilibrium distribution ,",
    "that is , when the model correctly describes the data , the analysis recovers the model parameters to within the calculated uncertainties .",
    "we note that there is a strong negative correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath48 , which indicates a degeneracy in the disc and halo contributions to the potential .",
    "that is , the data are most sensitive to the total force and this can be kept close to fixed by increasing the dark matter density while decreasing @xmath81 .",
    "there is also a strong positive correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath127 , which we might have anticipated by considering the leading term in the taylor expansion of the disc contribution to the potential : @xmath128 .",
    "the striking result in figure 5 is that inferred value of the local dark matter density differs by a factor of two from the true value in the presence of this ( quite realistic ) breathing mode .",
    "not surprisingly , when viewed in the @xmath129 and @xmath130 planes , these departures tend to lie along the degeneracies mentioned above .",
    "thus , we expect that the inferrences in the vertical force or , alternatively , the total surface density will be more robust . this point was discussed in @xcite and figure 6 shows that it is indeed the case .",
    "in particular , when the @xmath84 tracers are perturbed , @xmath6 is over - estimated by only about @xmath0 . with a sample size of @xmath112 stars and `` perfect '' data",

    "this assumption is greatly exploited in the analysis of @xcite where dozens of maps are used as independent tracers of the gravitational potential . in this section",
    "we argue the converse : differences in the force inferred from different tracer subpopulations may provide evidence that the disc is in a perturbed state .",

    "* agreement among the conclusions from multiple tracers would improve the robustness of the dark matter determination : if all the tracers give the same answer , we can be confident that the underlying model and the conclusions inferred from it are correct .",
