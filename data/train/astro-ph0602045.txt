    "asas  all sky automated survey , is a long term project dedicated to detection and monitoring variability of bright stars using small telescopes .",
    "recently @xcite presented results of the @xmath7-filter observations obtained at the las campanas observatory with a single 7  cm telescope .",
    "more than 50 thousand variables brighter than 14 magnitude were discovered in about three fourth of the sky with @xmath8 , among them 5,384 contact binary stars .",
    "this paper addresses the matter of the spatial density of contact binaries of the w  uma type ( @xmath3 day , from now on called `` ew '' ) as indicated by the asas survey data within its magnitude limits of @xmath9 .",
    "the relative spatial density ( in relation to the main sequence fgk dwarfs ) is evaluated via the luminosity function for the absolute magnitude range @xmath10 .",
    "we are very far from having a volume limited sample of ew binaries .",
    "in fact , the main problem is the completeness to a given magnitude limit . at present , the only sample which appears to include all ew binaries with photometric variability amplitudes @xmath11 mag .",
    "is the shallow hipparcos sample to @xmath5 @xcite ( from now on called the `` hipparcos sample '' or the `` 7.5 mag .  sample '' ) consisting of 35 objects , with 1/3 in that number being new detections .",
    "this sample suggests the relative spatial density of the ew binaries at a level of 0.2% of the fgk main sequence stars , but this fraction requires a confirmation by a larger sample , particularly for @xmath12 where the hipparcos sample contained very few objects .",
    "spatial density estimates of variable stars are crucially dependent on the detection limitations : photometric variability must be some 5 times larger than the photometric error , @xmath13 , for detection while another margin of @xmath14 is needed for proper characterisation and assurance that the star is not one of rather common @xmath15  sct or @xmath16  dor short - period pulsating main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions @xcite indicate that low - amplitude contact binaries should be very common as the amplitude distribution is expected to rise for amplitudes going to zero .",
    "ew binaries discovered in the asas survey show a different amplitude distribution from that of the hipparcos sample .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] gives the distribution for the hipparcos sample ( left panel ) and for the asas sample ( right panel ) , both compared with the theoretical amplitude distribution expected for random orbital inclinations and for a flat mass - ratio distribution , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the latter assumption is made for lack of any evidence to the contrary and needs verification .",
    "also , both observational samples include a small admixture of contact binaries with unequally deep eclipses ( sometimes called eb ) ; the presence of these binaries tends to elevate the high amplitude end of the distribution , so that the agreement of the hipparcos and the theoretical distributions may be fortuitous .",
    "it is easily noticeable in figure  [ fig1 ] that while the hipparcos sample follows the theoretical prediction , but suffers from the low number statistics .",
    ", the asas distribution lacks systems with amplitudes @xmath18 mag .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the detection selection effect with a relatively high detection threshold . for a direct comparison of the hipparcos and asas samples ,",
    "the numbers estimated from the latter must be multiplied by a correction factor of about @xmath19 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , with a considerable uncertainty of some 25% or so .    compared with the theoretical and hipparcos distributions",
    ", the asas amplitude distribution appears to have some excess of systems with amplitudes in the range of @xmath20 and too few systems with amplitudes @xmath21 mag .",
    "the absence of large amplitudes may be in the photometric blending of images and thus a `` dilution '' of the amplitudes because of the large images given by the 7  cm telescope , particularly when coupled with the now recognized prevalence ( @xmath22% ) of triple and multiple systems with contact binaries @xcite .",
    "the previously proposed absolute magnitude calibration for contact binaries @xcite , is a linear one : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the reddening corrected colour index ( which can be replaced by say @xmath25 ) ; it can predict @xmath26 to about 0.2  0.25 mag .",
    "it has been used successfully for many applications , particularly for confirming or disproving membership of contact binaries in stellar clusters @xcite . the main basis for",
    "the calibration is the hipparcos sample @xcite .",
    "this sample has been carefully scrutinized for multiplicity and for small , but measurable amounts of the local interstellar ( is ) reddening .",
    "the former requirement is related to the high frequency of triple systems among contact binaries while the latter stems from the availability of sensitive indicators of small amounts of local reddening such as the linear polarization , euv extinction or is cirrus emission .",
    ".[tab1 ] the sample used to establish @xmath27 calibration .",
    "vw  cep is the only system where corrections for the third component with @xmath28 has been applied .",
    "the last four systems were not used , see the text . [ cols= \"",
    "> , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the asas photometric survey covered the 5-magnitude interval @xmath1 .",
    "the two magnitude limits , expressed as distances , are shown as lines in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the other limitation comes from our @xmath26 calibration ( section  [ sect : abs - mag ] ) which is valid within @xmath10 . for each 1-mag",
    ".- wide bin in @xmath26 , we found the near and far limits ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 in table  [ tab2 ] ) , and simply counted the systems in the respective volume @xmath31 assuming that the survey south of @xmath32 covered @xmath33 of the whole celestial sphere .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab2 ] , while the luminosity function is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] compares the asas luminosity function , after correction by @xmath6 ( for systems missed because of the amplitude detection selection and of the removal of systems with @xmath34 days ) , with the hipparcos luminosity function and with the main sequence luminosity function @xcite scaled down by a factor of 500 times .",
    "the asas and hipparcos sample results are complementary , with the asas sample improving the luminosity function within the interval @xmath35 where the hipparcos sample had very few objects . while the luminosity function is better defined in the statistical sense with hundreds of binaries per @xmath36 bin , the correction for the systematic effects by a factor of @xmath37 leaves a rather wide margin for improvement .",
    "the comparison of the luminosity functions in figure  [ fig5 ] confirms the previously derived relative spatial frequency of contact binaries in the solar neighbourhood of 0.2% .",
    "although the relative frequency of bright contact binaries , @xmath38 , appears low at about 0.1% , the lower numbers of intrinsically bright binaries may be caused by our neglect of the is reddening and extinction and by the inapplicability of the simplified @xmath26 calibration .",
    "the relative frequency reaches 0.2% for the interval @xmath39 , but then drops to 0.1% in the @xmath40 bin , and to zero for still fainter objects .",
    "the sharp decline in the numbers of faint systems is related to the well established period cut - off at 0.215  0.22 days which still remains unexplained .",
    "it should be noted that the relative frequency may be higher in the central galactic disk at about 1/130 @xcite although this particular estimate suffered from photometric blending effects in the direction of the galactic bulge which may have raised the frequency by a factor of about @xmath41 .",
    "the author would like to express his thanks to the team of b.  paczyski , d.  szczygie , b.  pilecki and g.  pojmaski for enthusiastic and rapid sharing of their data and to grzegorz pojmaski for making asas such an useful variable - star study tool .",
