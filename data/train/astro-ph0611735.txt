    "the first breakthrough in infrared astronomy followed the launch of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) , which uncovered a substantial population of galaxies very luminous in the infrared ( e.g. neugebauer et al .",
    "1984 , soifer et al . 1987 ) .",
    "its successor , the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , demonstrated that a significant fraction of the energy budget in star - forming galaxies emerges in the infrared regime ( e.g soifer et al .",
    "since then , attempts to describe the nature of these objects have lead to extensive studies of the properties of dust and its presence in star forming regions , using spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and infrared colors as parameter constraints ( e.g. rowan - robinson @xmath6 crawford 1989 , dale @xmath6 helou 2002 ) . at the same time , correlations using photometry at different wavelengths have proved extremely useful in facilitating the study of the high - z universe and compensating for lack of long wavelength infrared ( ir ) data ( e.g. sanders @xmath6 mirabel 1996 ) .    since the launch of the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) ( werner et al . 2004 ) , we are able to study the emission from interstellar dust across a wide range of environments both locally and at high redshifts . deep surveys with the infrared array camera ( irac ) and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) ( rieke et al . 2004 ) have provided a wealth of energy distributions at every redshift .",
    "this letter presents the analysis of a sample of high - redshift sources detected at 70@xmath0 m by mips , in the region of the extended groth strip ( egs ) .",
    "we have used a multitude of photometry in the near , mid and far infrared to construct seds and examine galaxy colours and have demonstrated the compatibility of this population with samples of local infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) is a multi - wavelength survey with a coverage of 2.0@xmath710(davis et al .",
    "mips observations of the extended groth strip were conducted in two epochs : january and june of 2004 .",
    "the effective egs area with both irac and mips coverage is 725 arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "180 70@xmath9 sources were detected in this region with a point source sensitivity of 4 mjy at 5@xmath10 , hereafter the mips 70@xmath0 m sample .",
    "the irac and mips basic calibrated data ( bcd ) delivered by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) included flat - field and linearity corrections , dark subtraction and flux calibration .",
    "the bcd data were further processed by each team s own refinement routines , including distortion corrections , pointing refinement , mosaicing and cosmic ray removal by sigma - clipping .",
    "we used daophot to extract sources from both irac and mips images ; a point spread function ( psf ) fwhm of 1.8@xmath112.0@xmath11 for irac and 35@xmath11/40@xmath11 for mips",
    "70/160 @xmath0 m was used .",
    "the aperture fluxes in each band were subsequently corrected to total fluxes using known psf growth curves from fazio et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , huang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "all 70@xmath9 sources in the sample are detected at the irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 @xmath0 m , and mips 24 @xmath9 bands . however , because of the different alignment of the mips and irac images we do not have irac fluxes for all 70@xmath0 m sources .",
    "88@xmath12 of sources in the sample are also detected at 160@xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the aegis data set ( davis et al .",
    "2006 ) provides multi - wavelength photometry and spectroscopic redshifts for the 70@xmath9 sample , which permit the study of their x - ray - to - radio seds .",
    "42 sources in the 70@xmath0 m population have a reliable deep2 spectroscopic redshift in the range of @xmath13 ( we only use redshifts with qualities 3 or 4 , according to the deep2 classification ) .",
    "we further divide the 70@xmath0 m sources in two redshift bins : @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the terms `` low '' and `` high '' redshift hereafter ) .",
    "although , the deep2 project uses colour criteria to preselect objects with photometric redshifts in the range 0.7 - 1.55 , these constraints have not been imposed on the egs , therefore our redshift sample is not biased against the 70@xmath0 m sample .",
    "we limit the analysis in this letter to 38 objects for which we have full visible - ir seds and reliable ( see above ) spectroscopic redshifts ( the remaining 4 objects do not have full sed coverage ) .",
    "using cfht b , r , i imaging data and spitzer photometry ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath0 m ) we were able to construct 96 full seds , with 38 having reliable spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the seds of all objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts ( 38 sources ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we group the seds in three panels : objects with low - z ( left ) , high - z ( middle ) and , a separate panel for objects with agn - like seds ( right ) .",
    "objects from the low@xmath16high - z groups show typical galaxy seds : the optical bands are dominated by starlight which is then thermally reprocessed by dust and re - emitted at longer wavelengths , giving rise to the noticeable increase in mid - infrared ( mir ) flux .",
    "it is not surprising that the optical / near - ir part of the high - z seds is almost an order of magnitude lower than the low - z equivalent , as it samples a shorter wavelength region more strongly affected by extinction .    in the mid - infrared regime ( ie .",
    "12@xmath1724 @xmath0 m ) we find that the high - z objects have overall much higher flux densities than the low - z objects .",
    "there are two explanations for this : either high - z sources have higher hot dust emission shortwards of 20@xmath0 m or , low - z sources have higher cold dust emission longwards of 60@xmath0 m .",
    "low - z objects show a predominant excess flux in the irac 8@xmath0 m band , which we attribute to emission at 6.2 and/or 7.7@xmath0 m , from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .    in the far - infrared we note a large scatter in 160@xmath0 m fluxes evident in both low and high - z sources .",
    "we find 70@xmath0m/160@xmath0 m @xmath18 ratios of @xmath31 and @xmath30.4 for the low and high - z sources , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the energy distributions of local hii region - like galaxies ( e.g. dale et al . 2005 , hereafter d05 ) . in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings )",
    "results , presented in d05 , approximately 35@xmath12 of the objects show a turnover at 160@xmath0 m and their average 70/160 @xmath18 ratios are @xmath31 ; accordingly , we evaluate our objects to be equally `` warm '' to local sources .",
    "overall , the majority of our objects have characteristics consistent with those of luminous star - forming infrared galaxies .",
    "however , a small fraction ( 9 out of 96 ) reveal power - law type seds indicative of the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( of the 9 agn - candidates only 3 have secure deep2 spectroscopic redshifts ) .",
    "these power law - type sources have distinctly redder irac colors and are clearly identified in irac - color plots .",
    "interestingly , the available optical spectra do not show any of the characteristic signatures of an agn , such as broad wings in the balmer@xmath16oxygen lines ; it is only with the addition of mir data that we are able to peer through the obscuring dust and reveal the active nucleus .",
    "only 1/3 of these candidate - agns are also detected in the x - rays , not surprising , as the chandra full band ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) data ( flux limit 3.5@xmath19 ergs / s/@xmath20 ) ( georgakakis et al . 2006 ) are not as deep as the mips and irac detections .",
    "the selected fraction of power law - type galaxies agrees with a similar study in frayer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . however , taking into account ultra - hard ( 5 - 10 kev ) x - ray fluxes and hardness ratios leads us to an upper limit of 15@xmath12 of agns in the sample , consistent with the findings of fadda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , franceschini et al .",
    "brandt et al . ( 2006 ) , show that in their 24@xmath0 m survey the contribution of agns is high ( @xmath21 ) when selecting the brightest z@xmath40.6 sources , but @xmath310@xmath12 when considering the whole redshift range .",
    "our results are consistent with this study , as our power law - type sources with spectroscopic redshifts are found at z@xmath40.6 .      in this section",
    "we carry out a comparative study of different diagnostics in order to trace the star formation rate ( sfr ) in our sample .",
    "such a study is possible given the wealth of information available for the aegis project ( davis et al .",
    "we derive sfrs based on optical balmer/[oii ] emission lines , ir ( present work ) and 20 cm radio ( ivison et al .",
    "2006 ) luminosities .",
    "our computations are based on the prescriptions of kennicutt ( 1998 ) and bressan , silva @xmath6 granato ( 2002 ) .",
    "all available spectra were examined for the presence of hydrogen recombination and oxygen forbidden emission lines , as tracers of young stellar populations .",
    "we identified h@xmath22 and [ oii ] features in 22@xmath12 and 10@xmath12 of the spectra , respectively .",
    "we extracted line fluxes by calibrating the continuum using cfht optical / near - ir data and included stellar absorption corrections for each balmer line .",
    "we derive an `` average '' sfr@xmath23 of 2 m@xmath24 .",
    "likewise we derived average sfr@xmath25 and sfr@xmath26 of 100 and 80 m@xmath24 , respectively .    in figure 2",
    "we show a comparison of optical vs ir vs radio sfrs as a function of redshift for 38 objects from the 70 @xmath0 m sample , which have full irac and mips photometry as well as reliable spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath13 .",
    "radio and ir sfrs reach values of @xmath3900 @xmath27 , revealing an active star - forming population .",
    "the sfr@xmath25 is on average 50 times higher than the non - extinction - corrected sfr@xmath23 .",
    "assuming an a@xmath282 ( a typical a@xmath29 value for infrared selected objects , see e.g. rigopoulou et al . 2000 ) then sfr@xmath30sfr@xmath31 10 confirming that extinction is indeed very high .",
    "the fact that sfr@xmath32 sfr@xmath26 reinforces the notion that the 70 @xmath0 m population is indeed made up of dusty star - forming galaxies .",
    "moreover , it provides a nice confirmation that the radio  far - ir correlation that was found to exist for local galaxies ( e.g. condon , anderson & helou , 1991 ) extends out to z@xmath31 sources .",
    "finally , it is important to stress that any attempts to derive sfr estimates based on optical@xmath16uv measurements are likely to provide severe underestimates .",
    "in this section we investigate the mid - to - far infrared luminosity correlations .",
    "we limit our study to objects with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts and full seds , and explore the correlations for each redshift bin separately . for our computations we have adopted a cosmology with @xmath33=0.3 , @xmath34=0.7 and @xmath35 .",
    "investigation of spectral energy distributions and behavior of colors ( see earlier text ) has lead us to the conclusion that our 70@xmath0 m sample shares many similar characteristics with local infrared luminous galaxies . consequently to estimate k - corrections we used the complete sed of the local galaxy ngc 4631 ( convolved to the spitzer resolution ) and followed the prescription of hogg ( 2002 ) .",
    "we are , of course , aware that use of a single template to derive k - corrections may introduce some biases . however , as appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also points out the presently available models do not fully encompass the observed parameters especially in the far - infrared .",
    "this is likely to change with the availability of more spitzer far - infrared datasets such as sings .    in figure 3",
    "we plot the 24 vs 70 and 70 vs 160 @xmath0 m correlations .",
    "we have performed a weighted least - square fit for each case , taking into account the calibration errors of 10 and 20@xmath12 for the 24 and 70@xmath0 m fluxes respectively , as well as the errors arising from sed fitting .",
    "we quantified the strength of the correlations using the pearson linear coefficient .",
    "the pearson coefficient ranges between 0 and @xmath36 for no or excellent correlation respectively , with any intermediate value indicating the degree of linear dependence between the variables .",
    "our values of @xmath30.8 for the 2470@xmath0 m plot and @xmath30.9 for the 70160@xmath0 m plot indicate a strong relation .",
    "as expected , most of the energy in this population is emitted in the far - ir , also supported by the lines of best fit . by combining the above results we derived a relationship to estimate the monochromatic luminosity at 160@xmath0 m from data at 24 and 70@xmath0 m , with an accuracy higher than 30@xmath12 , for the low - z and high - z cases .",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38    it is evident that the well - studied mid - to - far infrared relation found to hold for local galaxies ( e.g. dale @xmath6 helou 2002 ) can also be extended to the non - local universe .",
    "although , by limiting our study to the objects with spectroscopic redshifts , we select in favor of the brightest sources , we still manage to sample a wide range of luminosities representative of z@xmath31 populations emerging through various deep infrared surveys .",
    "the correlations we have found can be used to obtain a direct estimate of the far - infrared luminosity of z@xmath31 objects and avoid the large errors introduced from mid - fir extrapolations of various galaxy templates .",
