    "from the birth of _ kepler _ s second - life mission , k2 @xcite , grew the k2 galactic archaeology program ( gap ) @xcite . with this program",
    "we aim to measure convectively - driven , or solar - like , oscillations in tens of thousands of red giants using the high - precision photometry from k2 .",
    "the asteroseismic imprint in the data combined with ground - based measurements of effective temperature and metallicity will allow us to infer stellar properties such as radius and mass , and hence distance and age , even for stars out to a few tens of kilo parsec @xcite .",
    "this in turn will enable us to probe the structure and evolution of vast regions of the galaxy not probed before by asteroseismic means ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it has become clear that the power of such seismic - inferred galactic studies , depends strongly on how well we understand the target selection and the detection biases involved @xcite .",
    "the k2 gap target selection has been particularly designed to gain full control of the selection bias , and hence to mitigate some of the problems encountered using stars from corot or the original _ kepler _  mission . however , for the program to reach its full potential we also need to be able to predict any detection bias in the asteroseismology in order to make robust inferences based on galactic model comparisons .    in this paper , we present the seismic analysis of all stars selected by the k2 gap in campaign 1 ( c1 ) , and release , to the community , the full seismic data set of the large frequency separation , @xmath6 , and the frequency of maximum power , @xmath1 . after an initial description of the target selection ( sect .  [ targetselect ] ) , we give a brief overview of the methods used to measure the seismic properties ( sect.[methods ] ) , before presenting the results in sect .",
    "[ results ] . in sect .",
    "[ detectbias ] we assess the detection bias and its effect on the sample completeness before concluding in sect .  [ conclusion ] .",
    "our prime targets are red giants .",
    "the advantage of red giants is that they are intrinsically bright and show larger amplitude oscillations compared to dwarfs .",
    "oscillations can therefore be detected even for distant stars .",
    "most giants also oscillate with frequencies that are well sampled by k2 s main , long cadence , observation mode .",
    "this enables large numbers of stars to be observed as required to perform robust stellar population studies .",
    "we deliberately follow a simple color - magnitude target selection to ensure reproducibility and to strengthen the synergy with the selection criteria of large - scale high - resolution spectroscopic surveys from ground such as apogee @xcite , and galah @xcite . specifically , for c1 ( proposal go1059 ) we selected all stars with @xmath9 and @xmath10 using 2mass , and sorted our target list by @xmath11-band magnitude @xcite , and photometry quality flags ( qflg ) equal to a or b. see 2mass website , vizier 2mass table , or the apogee target selection paper by @xcite for more information on flags . ] .",
    "stars with @xmath9 already observed by apogee ( 258 ) and rave ( another 147 ) at the time of target selection were bumped up as top priority targets , and for those we allowed the eight stars fainter than @xmath12 to enter our list .",
    "figure  [ cmd]a shows @xmath13 versus @xmath14  for a synthesized population of stars representative of the k2 c1 field , which we generated using the _ galaxia _  milky way synthesis tool @xcite .",
    "we have highlighted the stars that follow the k2 gap selection function .",
    "it illustrates how our color - cut is the sweet spot to ensure we do not loose many helium - core burning red giants while not including too many main sequence and subgiant stars for which we can not detect oscillations with k2 s long cadence mode .",
    "figure  [ cmd]b shows the expected giant fraction based on the _ galaxia _  simulation , and figure  [ cmd]c shows the color - magnitude diagram of the k2-gap - selected stars that were observed by k2 . of the total 21,648 c1 targets observed by k2 , 8,630 are on the k2 gap target list .",
    "this number is further broken down into 8,385 stars explicitly sourced from our target list , hence following our selection approach , and 245 serendipitous stars sourced from other k2 observing programs , which are therefore following a different , and rather complex , selection function .",
    "we further note that there were 155 stars , randomly distributed in priority , among our top 8,540 ranked targets , which were not observed , hence resulting in the 8,385 observed k2 gap - selected stars in total .",
    "the missing 155 stars represent an unbiased set , which were deselected by the mission because they , or a saturated neighbor , were deemed too close to an edge of active silicon on the detector .",
    "hence , they do not cause concern in terms of biasing the selection function . in summary , our color - magnitude selection can be regarded complete down to @xmath15 , corresponding to 14.5 - 16.5 in the _ kepler _  band - pass , @xmath16 , depending on color .",
    "all k2 gap targets were observed in the spacecraft s 29.4 minute long cadence mode for about 80 days from 2014 may 30 to 2014 aug 21 .",
    "we adopted the light curves from @xcite and @xcite , which we high - pass filtered and gap - filled following the approach by @xcite .",
    "this approach should minimise the artifacts in the data caused by the near - regular firing of the on - board thrusters used to stabilise the spacecraft role angle every 6-hrs .",
    "our color - magnitude selection is expected to include a significant fraction of dwarfs and subgiants , particularly for high galactic latitude fields like c1 ( figure  [ cmd]b ) . due to the simplicity of the selection function",
    ", these dwarfs and subgiants will form a unique subset to study exoplanet occurrence rates as a function of different stellar populations in our galaxy .",
    "the giant - dwarf classifications provided by our program will also be valuable to prevent biases when calculating planet occurrence rates , which sensitively depend on stellar classifications @xcite .",
    "our subsequent seismic analysis will show oscillations only in stars with roughly @xmath17 @xcite , but for stars with @xmath18 we can expect to see the signature of granulation , which will reveal that they are intrinsically bright giants ( sect .",
    "[ methods ] ) .",
    "hence , the stars with no detected oscillations or granulation will most likely be the dwarfs and subgiants that could be used for exoplanet occurrence rate studies . from a population synthesis model of our c1 selection using _ galaxia _",
    "@xcite we expect our sample to include about 7500 stars with @xmath19 , almost all dwarfs ( @xmath20 ) and only about 100 subgiant and low luminosity red giant branch stars ( @xmath21 ) ( see sect .  [ results ] ) .",
    "the range of oscillation frequencies detectable from a single campaign of k2 data is set by the length and the sampling rate of the time series , which defines the lower and upper frequency limits , respectively .",
    "these correspond to a range in @xmath1  of @xmath22-@xmath23@xmath2hz@xcite , or roughly @xmath24 . because our selection approach includes stars outside this range , and because it is critical to understand the seismic detection bias for galactic archaeology purposes , it becomes particularly important that we assess robustly if a star is a giant , with @xmath25 @xmath1/@xmath2hz  @xmath26 , or not .",
    "we receive 4,000 - 10,000 new k2 gap targets for each campaign . with this rate of new stars to be analysed , and the need to robustly determine which of them are giants , calls for a new approach to analyse and consolidate the seismic results compared to previous analyses based on the _ kepler _  field .",
    "those analyses were focusing on providing measurements of stars that where clearly showing oscillations , assessed by the level of agreement between results from independent methods @xcite .",
    "this approach is prone to favour / select stars with the clearest detections rather than selecting all stars , introducing a bias that is difficult to mimic in subsequent comparisons with galactic synthesis models .",
    "here we use six independent analysis pipelines ( called can , cor , bhm , a2z , syd , and bam ) to analyse the light curves in order to extract the large frequency separation , @xmath6 , and the frequency of maximum power , @xmath1  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  for more discussion on those two observables ) .",
    "except for bhm , we also measure the amplitude of the oscillations , or some equivalent measure of oscillation strength for validation purposes .",
    "pipeline leads were asked to only return results that they trusted , because comparisons between pipelines would not be used to remove outliers .",
    "instead , we rely on the combined set of results from all pipelines to generate a list of stars for which at least one pipeline was able to detect oscillations ( meaning at least measure @xmath1 ) , and for that set to make careful visual inspections to verify if the stars indeed show signs of oscillations or granulation in the power spectrum .      in the following",
    "we describe briefly each pipeline and how some of them used post processing criteria to select the final sample of stars believed to show oscillations .",
    "it should be stressed that only three pipelines ( can , bhm , and bam ) determine the likelihood of a star showing oscillations based purely on the power and time scale of the seismic ( and granulation ) signal .",
    "the others require a clear presence of a regular frequency pattern , from which @xmath6can be measured .",
    "the latter is a more strict criterion and hence leads to fewer detections of oscillating stars .",
    "* can * uses the following bayesian nested - sampling - based scheme for the fitting and estimation of the measurement uncertainties .",
    "first , the ` typical ' time scale in the time series is found by fitting a sinc function to the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of the time series @xcite , and a @xmath27 goodness of fit test is carried out .",
    "then , it is evaluated if the rms of the time series is within a factor of five from the expected value given the acf timescale , which makes use of an empirical rms - time scale relation ( analogous to using an amplitude-@xmath1relation ) .",
    "if a star passes both the goodness of fit test and fall within the rms - time scale relation , it is accepted as a ` red giant candidate ' , for which the following , and most restrictive , step is performed . by fitting the power spectrum with and without a gaussian ( to account for an oscillation power excess ) on top of the background , the bayesian model evidence determines if the power excess is statistically significant or not . here , the range in @xmath1  for the location of the gaussian is guided by the acf time scale @xcite .",
    "if a star is deemed to not show any significant power excess implies that the @xmath1  from the fit can not be trusted and the star is deemed a non - detection . to tension",
    "the number of accepted false positive against the number of reject true positives , the applied significance threshold was informed by visual inspection of the power spectra that felt close to the acceptance / rejection cut - off .",
    "this approach returned 1106 oscillating stars .",
    "the central three radial orders of the power excess is then fitted by a sequence of lorentzian profiles representing oscillation modes and parameterised by the frequency of the central radial mode and a large and small frequency separation @xcite .",
    "however , the fit to extract @xmath6  returned robust results only for a subset of the stars ( 583 stars ) .",
    "* cor * : the method is the same as used for corot or _ kepler _",
    "stars @xcite .",
    "the large separation is detected first , from the autocorrelation of the time series computed as the fourier spectrum of the filtered fourier spectrum of the signal ( eacf ) . a simple statistical test based on the h0 hypothesis",
    "is used to assess the significance of the @xmath6detection from the value of the eacf . in case of positive detection ,",
    "the other global seismic parameters are determined .",
    "a star is regarded to show solar - like oscillations if its @xmath6 , fwhm of the smoothed power excess , mean height of the power excess at @xmath1 , and height of the background at @xmath1  all closely follow the empirically calibrated mean relations as a function of @xmath1  @xcite . for k2 ,",
    "a special treatment is applied to cope with the spacecraft thruster firing frequency .",
    "it consists in using the empirical scaling relations with stronger constraints when @xmath1  is found to be near the firing frequency or its harmonics .",
    "uncertainties are calibrated functions of the eacf parameter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "*  for details ) .",
    "cor returned results for all stars thought to provide robust @xmath6  and @xmath1  values ( 778 stars ) .",
    "* bhm * uses a three - stage approach , described in detail in elsworth ( in prep . ) . to summarise : first , the white - noise - subtracted power spectrum is divided by a heavily smoothed version of the raw power spectrum , representing the noise profile , to create the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as function of frequency .",
    "the likelihood of each frequency bin representing just noise is then calculated according the h0 hypothesis .",
    "next , we apply the h1 hypothesis to a series of overlapping frequency segments of gradually increasing central frequency along the snr - spectrum",
    ". the width of each segment changes as function of its central frequency following the empirical oscillation power width-@xmath1  relation from @xcite .",
    "the combination of h0 and h1 is used to form an odds ratio of there being oscillation signal in a given segment .",
    "if a segment shows detection of oscillation power , the next two stages provide estimates of @xmath1  and @xmath6 .",
    "this part of the method follows largely the oct method described in @xcite , but with some extra selection criteria needed because of the short duration of the time series .",
    "for @xmath6 , stringent tests are applied to mitigate against the measured @xmath6  being corrupted by the frequency spacing between the radial and octupole modes .",
    "these tests meant that for many of the stars only the @xmath1  values is considered reliable . in total 1031 stars",
    "have a robust measurement of @xmath1 , while only 198 have also a @xmath6  value .",
    "* a2z+ * is an improved version of the a2z pipeline described by @xcite , but we refer to it in this paper simply as a2z .",
    "it uses the same method as cor to determine a first estimate of @xmath6 , and the frequency range where that signal is present , from which a collapsed echelle diagram is formed to determine the location of the radial modes .",
    "@xmath1  is determined by fitting a gaussian in top of the background to the power spectrum .",
    "the guess for granulation timescale used in the fit is based on the results from @xcite . for stars where the highest radial mode was statistically significant at the 99% level , @xmath6",
    "is recomputed from the power spectrum of the power spectrum ( ps2 ) where the dipole modes are masked out .",
    "here , we use only the central orders of the spectrum centered on the highest radial mode .",
    "the number of radial orders used is typically four but depends slightly on the signal - to - noise ratio and @xmath1 .",
    "the power spectrum and echelle diagram are used to visually verify the @xmath6  measurements , and only stars with convincing detections are kept . finally , as a post - processing criteria ,",
    "stars are kept only if the slope of a linear fit to the power spectrum in log - log space is steeper than -0.5 . in order words , if the granulation signal is not clear the star is not expected to show clear oscillations either ( and is most likely a dwarf or too faint giant with a white noise dominated spectrum ) .",
    "uncertainties were computed with a weighted centroids method that depends on the frequency resolution in the ps2 . because we used the same number of orders around @xmath1  for most stars ,",
    "the relative uncertainties are generally very similar for the stars .",
    "a2z returned @xmath1  and @xmath6  results for 673 stars .    *",
    "syd * : this pipeline is described in detail in @xcite , and uses monte - carlo simulations to generate statistically perturbed spectra from which measurement uncertainties are estimated as described in @xcite .",
    "the pipeline does not include a statistical assessment of whether oscillations are present in the data .",
    "hence , to automate the selection of robust detections we impose a number of post processing criteria .",
    "first , stars are kept only if the power spectrum is steep enough to show the presence of granulation , using the same criteria as a2z .",
    "secondly , the correlation between an empirical average model spectrum and the slightly smoothed collapsed power spectrum of the central four orders need to be above a certain cut - off value ( to ensure a clear mode pattern revealing @xmath6 ) .",
    "the correlation process follow that of @xcite , and like can , the cut - off is informed by visual inspection of stars that are accepted versus rejected .",
    "thirdly , the stars need to have a @xmath6  within 30% of the average expected @xmath6  from the @xmath6-@xmath1  relation of @xcite .",
    "this cut was chosen based on the natural spread seen among the high signal - to - noise _ kepler _  red giant sample @xcite .",
    "finally , stars need to have an oscillation amplitude within a factor of two of the average fiducial amplitude-@xmath1  trend seen for spectroscopically confirmed red giants from @xcite .",
    "syd returned results for all stars thought to provide robust values for both @xmath6  and @xmath1  ( 559 stars ) .",
    "* bam * : like can , bam uses a bayesian mcmc scheme for fitting the background and the oscillation excess power hump in the frequency spectrum , and for estimation of the measurement uncertainties ( zinn et al . in prep . ) .",
    "it first fits a two - component noise background ( plus white noise ) whose resulting parameters are subsequently used as priors on a fit to the oscillation excess , modeled as a gaussian with amplitude , width , and center ( @xmath1 ) as free parameters .",
    "one set of priors are calculated from empirical correlations between the background parameters and @xmath1 ; another prior is placed on the timescale ratio between the two background components ; and a final set of priors link @xmath1  to the gaussian amplitude and width .",
    "these priors are then used to derive the ( total prior ) probability of finding the measured value of each fitted parameter . after fitting the model ( of noise plus excess ) to the power spectrum , bam selects a star as an oscillator if : 1 ) the signal - to - background ratio at @xmath1  is greater than 3.0 , and 2 ) the total prior probability is within the 4-sigma confidence interval .",
    "subsequently , @xmath6  is determined by a least - squares fit to the folded spectrum using the 4@xmath6-wide @xmath1-centered section of the spectrum with @xmath6  as the folding frequency . the folded radial , dipole , and quadrupole mode regions are each modeled with a lorentzian function .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath6  is estimated as the quadrature sum of the uncertainties on the mode widths and locations .",
    "@xmath6  is returned for stars only if the probability of @xmath6  and the mode visibilities are within @xmath28 of their expected values based on priors .",
    "bam returned @xmath1  for 951 stars and @xmath6  for 759 stars .",
    "some of the pipelines used here have previously been compared on the basis of _ kepler _  data .",
    "although they have improved since , and changes has been made to accommodate k2-specific issues , we refer the reader to such comparison papers for additional reading @xcite .",
    "in table  [ tab1 ] we list the total number of stars for which each pipeline detected the presence of oscillations , meaning at least a measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "when combined , we found 1262 unique stars with at least one pipeline reporting detection . in table  [ tab1b ] we list the total number of stars for which the pipelines also detected @xmath6 .",

    "the figures highlight statistical properties of the results including the natural biases between pipelines arising from the fact that each pipeline measures and hence defines the seismic observables in slightly different ways",
    ". users for which the magnitude of these biases are important for their science are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the specific methods adopted by the pipelines and their comparisons ( see references in sect .  [ pipelines ] ) .",
    "we visually inspected power spectra for all 1262 pipeline - detected giants , and assigned them to one of three categories ` yes ' , ` maybe ' , or ` no ' , according to whether they showed oscillations and/or granulation .",
    "this is obviously a subjective approach , which in a sense takes a continuum of probabilities of a star showing oscillations and puts that into three bins .",
    "however , we did it such that ` yes ' meant we felt confident the star oscillated , while ` no ' meant we were confident it did not oscillate below the nyquist frequency .",
    "figure  [ example_spectra ] shows a sample representative of low ( left panels ) , medium ( centre panels ) , and high ( right panels ) @xmath1  detections ( by the pipelines ) . for each @xmath1  case",
    "we show the resulting three different visual detection categories ; except for the low @xmath1  case , where there were no stars categorised as ` no ' detections , for which we instead show a maybe case that straddle the no category .    to test the subjectivity of our visual inspection , we had two people look through the power spectra independently .",
    "cross checking their results showed not a single case where one person said no and the other said yes , and there were only five borderline cases between neighboring categories , where one said yes or no and the other said maybe. we therefore regard the result of the visual inspection as highly robust .",
    "a similar exercise had been implemented by @xcite , also showing consistency between three independent people .",
    "we include the result of the visual detection verification in table  [ tab2 ] and summarise how each pipeline performs relative to our visual inspection in table  [ tab1 ] ( in pure counts and percent ) .",
    "it is worth noting that despite the larger number of stars returned by can , bhm , and bam , those samples seem to be of similar quality as the rest ( high ` yes ' and low ` no ' fractions ) .        of the 1262 giants detected by at least one pipeline , we found 1100 in the ` yes ' category , 110 were assigned as ` maybe ' , and 52 ` no ' detections .",
    "if we assume the ` maybe ' cases are all genuinely oscillating giants , just with low s / n ratios or with @xmath1  outside the 10 - 270@xmath2hz  range , this would suggest we have up to @xmath33 detections .    to further double check",
    "that the confirmed detections were in line in terms of their @xmath1  values , we compared pipeline values with visual values . the latter was found by manually placing ( and mouse - clicking ) a cursor on interactive plots of power spectra at the location of @xmath1 . the intrinsic uncertainty in performing this manual @xmath1  localisation , of up to 30% , meant we could safely use them to identify clear outliers .",
    "it was encouraging to see only a handful of pipeline results were indicated as outliers .",
    "one way to check that the @xmath6  and @xmath1  measurements originate from oscillations and not from spurious humps of excess power is to verify that the amplitude , or some sort of similar measure of mode oscillation strength , show a correlation with @xmath1  as expected from scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and empirically demonstrated for large samples of giants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ amp - numax ]",
    "we show mode strength versus @xmath1  for the pipelines that return both quantities .",
    "all panels show correlations indicative of detections due to oscillations .",
    "we also indicate the visual verification results by different colored symbols .",
    "it is reassuring to see that the ` no ' detections ( red open symbols ) fall predominantly in the narrow frequency ranges around the spacecraft s thruster firing frequency and its harmonics or very close to the nyquist frequency . due to an improvement in the spacecraft altitude control since campaign 3",
    ", we expect the thruster firing will have negligible impact on the data for later campaigns as evidenced by the clean c5-based data in @xcite .",
    "the ` maybe ' category is spread out more ( magenta filled symbols ) , but often at extreme frequencies pushing the limit of what can be measured with the length and sampling of the k2 data .",
    "or they are near the artifacts from thruster firings ; although a significant fraction are between 20 and 30@xmath2hz which are probably helium - core burning stars or possibly artifacts at half the thruster firing frequency .",
    "these results show that the visual inspection provides valuable complementary information , which suggests that the pipelines only struggle in a limited range and mostly extreme ends of the parameter space .    to further investigate whether the seismic measurements agree with expectations , we show the @xmath6-@xmath1  relation in figure  [ dnu - numax ] , which is expected to be relatively tight both from scaling relations @xcite and as demonstrated for large samples of giants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        from _ kepler",
    "_  data we generally do not see stars outside the @xmath34% range around the mean @xmath6-@xmath1  relation ( solid lines ) , which roughly encompasses a mass spread of 0.5 - 2.5m@xmath35 .",
    "in the following we investigate to what extent our resulting sample of oscillating giants is affected by detection bias . unlike @xcite we do not have prior spectroscopic knowledge of the evolutionary state of our stars to guide this analysis .",
    "for a given non - detection we can therefore not be certain if it is outside the detectable frequency range or if it is just a very low s / n case .",
    "however , we have a much larger set of stars than in @xcite , which should enable us to make inference on the presence of likely detection biases by comparing our samples of @xmath6and @xmath1  detections , and in turn compare the latter sample with a synthesized population .",
    "the obvious caveat with the synthesized population will be its model dependency .",
    "but as long as the model is not grossly inaccurate we can reasonably assume only small detection biases could remain unnoticed .      comparing the number of stars between figure  [ amp - numax ] and  [ dnu - numax ] plotted in each panel",
    ", illustrates that more stars show evidence of oscillation excess power ( a @xmath1  measurement ) than a clear frequency pattern from which @xmath6  can be determined ( see also tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab1b ] ) .",
    "this is an inevitable consequence of the length of the time series , which is not long enough to fully resolve the mode patterns in some of the stars . in figure  [ numax - histo ]",
    "we show the histogram of stars with a visually verified @xmath1measurement ( green ) , compared to those where we also have a @xmath6  measurement ( blue ) .",
    "it is evident that the problem of identifying @xmath6 , affects the helium - core burning stars the most , particularly stars with @xmath1  around 30@xmath2hz .",
    "this arises because they show more complex frequency spectra , and mode power is spread into more frequency bins , which are therefore each of lower amplitude , resulting in less clear mode patterns .",
    "based on figure  [ numax - histo ] we conclude the sample of stars with both @xmath6  and @xmath1  measurements is biased at least for helium - core burning stars .",
    "it is not clear if that applies only to the helium - core burning stars that have @xmath1  @xmath5@xmath2hz .",
    "the @xmath6  detection bias is more severe for some pipelines where we see a clear lack of stars in the blue curve compared to the green curve ( e.g. can ) , potentially affecting all stars with @xmath1  @xmath36@xmath2hz .",
    "looking at @xcite ( their figure 2 ) it seems that for 50 - 100 day _ kepler _",
    "time series , which brackets the 80-day k2 c1 series , there is a deficit of stars with @xmath6  in the range 3 - 5@xmath2hz  ( equivalent to @xmath1  @xmath5@xmath2hz ) relative to the expected smooth decrease in detections for decreasing @xmath6  ( or @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with what we see here for k2 .",
    "we therefore recommend that the @xmath6  detection bias for the potentially affected stars ( @xmath1  @xmath36@xmath2hz ) be quantified specifically for k2 using the same pipelines as presented here before the @xmath6  results of these stars are used for population studies .",
    "however , the reported @xmath6  could of course still be used safely for other purposes ( or indeed for population studies restricted to stars in the unaffected @xmath1  range ( figure  [ numax - histo ] ) .        here",
    ", we will compare our number of detected giants with what one would expect from synthesizing our target sample .",
    "we note that while the total number of detected giants is up to 1210 , they were found among all 8,630 observed stars in the k2 gap list , rather than only the 8,385 that follow the k2 gap selection ( section  [ targetselect ] ) .",
    "hence , about 30 of the detected giants are serendipitous from other k2 proposals , which should be subtracted before comparing with a synthesized sample we have marked the stars that do not following the k2 gap selection ] .",
    "we use the galaxy synthesis tool , _ galaxia _  to synthesize our target sample of 8,385 stars by imposing the selection described in section  [ targetselect ] , and the @xmath1  detection range of 10 - 270@xmath2hz .",
    "this results in an initial @xmath37 expected giants ( within poisson error ) in the detectable @xmath1  range , which is significantly larger than the number of giants actually detected .",
    "hence , we want to investigate whether there might be any significant biases with respect to signal and/or noise .",
    "the signal is the oscillation amplitude for which @xmath1  is a good proxy ( fig .",
    "[ amp - numax ] ) , while the noise can be approximated by brightness , @xmath16 .",
    "in figure  [ numax - kpmag ] we therefore show @xmath1  and @xmath16 for all visually inspected detections ( green , magenta , and red symbols ) .",
    "the grey dots in the background show the synthesis population of 1650 expected giants .",
    "it is clear from this comparison that we can not detect oscillations in stars in the upper right corner , which are the faintest ( more noisy ) , and the least evolved stars ( highest @xmath1  and hence lowest intrinsic oscillation amplitudes ) .    to assess if this apparent ` lack ' of faint low luminosity red giants is expected , we need to take the oscillation detectability into account .",
    "we derive the detectability following the formulation by @xcite .",
    "the stellar properties are given as part of the output from _ galaxia _ , from which the oscillation and granulation signal is predicted .",
    "different to @xcite , we use the more up - to - date relation for oscillation amplitude by @xcite , which is empirically calibrated by open cluster red giants .",
    "we also need to re - calibrate the noise estimates compared to the _ kepler _  results @xcite adopted by @xcite to incorporate the k2-specific noise properties .     of all k2 gap targets ( black dots ) .",
    "green filled symbols shows stars verified visually as clear detections , while magenta filled symbols are maybe detections .",
    "symbol size scales with @xmath1 .",
    "vertical dotted line indicates the saturation limit .",
    "the dotted red curve shows the _ kepler _  noise floor from @xcite .",
    "the grey dotted line is shifted up by a factor of two .",
    "the red solid curve illustrates our adopted k2 noise , obtained by raising the _ kepler _ noise floor by a factor of three .",
    "[ rms - kp],width=302 ]    to illustrate the k2-_kepler _",
    "noise difference , we show in figure  [ rms - kp ] the measured scatter in the time series for all stars in our sample ( black dots ) . for comparison",
    "we show the noise floor of the equivalent _ kepler _  time series scatter from @xcite ( dotted red curve ) , which matches the k2 noise floor quite well ( grey dotted curve ) when shifted up be a factor of two . however , this noise floor is clearly a lower limit even for photon noise dominated stars ( @xmath38 ) , which for the vast majority show a scatter that ranges a factor of four .",
    "we therefore adopt a larger and more representative noise level for k2 of three times the _ kepler _  level ( solid red curve ) .",
    "now , taking our derived detectability into account , we expect to detect oscillations in only @xmath39 of the synthesis sample ( figure  [ numax - kpmag ] , black dots ) .",
    "this synthesis sub sample shows the same lack of stars as our observations in the top right corner in the figure  [ numax - kpmag ] main panels . for added clarity",
    "we also show histograms of the observed and synthesis distributions as function of @xmath1  and @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath16 distributions demonstrate a drop in stars occurs beyond @xmath40 - 12.7 ( green curve ) , which is similar to what is expected from the _ galaxia _  distribution peaking at @xmath41 ( black curve ) .",
    "there seem to be a tendency for all pipelines to claim detections where no detection was verified by the visual inspection for stars fainter than @xmath42 ( red open symbols ) .",
    "we therefore caution using these seismic results of stars fainter than @xmath43 for population studies due to potential completeness issues in the current sample of results .",
    "however , we note that the lack of luminous faint ( @xmath44 ) giants in our c1 sample prevents us from reaching definitive conclusions about detection bias towards the faint end .",
    "now we turn to the combined set of results , and show the sample distribution in @xmath1-@xmath16 space in figure  [ numax - kpmag - comb ] .        here",
    "we acknowledge that different pipelines have different strengths and by compiling all the stars for which at least one pipeline detected oscillations , we are more likely to obtain as many stars as possible in our sample . hence , our sample will be more likely to contain , as closely as possible to , all detectable oscillating stars .",
    "for this part of our investigation we adopted @xmath1  values first sourced from can , then we added those from a2z not already in the can sample , then bhm , syd , cor , and finally bam , following the order of the pipeline with the most to least unique detections . by construction ,",
    "not all stars in the compiled list have a @xmath1  value from the same pipeline",
    ". however , for the purpose of investigating the completeness of the population as a whole , the relatively small @xmath1  biases between different pipelines plays no important role ( appendix , figures  [ appfig9 ] ,  [ appfig10 ] ) .    to use the sample for population studies one needs to take into account that we can not detect stars above the fiducial dotted curve , expressed by @xmath1@xmath4@xmath2hz .",
    "we note that the curve seems to have a slightly steeper dependence on @xmath16 than predicted ( see black dots ) .",
    "the predicted dependence is close to @xmath45 as expected from the photon noise limit , and we attribute the steeper observed dependence to the fact that our adopted noise estimate becomes increasingly underestimated towards fainter stars ; as opposed to bright stars where the photon noise plays no significant role in the detectability . in order words ,",
    "our simple noise prescription does not take full account of the gradual transition between the two noise regimes and the intrinsic spread in the noise from star to star .",
    "it is therefore also difficult to make an accurate model prediction of the absolute number of expected detections .",
    "changing the adopted noise level by about 30% , changes the number of expected detections by about 100 ( with larger noise resulting in fewer expected detections ) . from the distributions shown as histograms of different parts of the @xmath1-@xmath16 parameter space we see that the discrepancy between observed and predicted number of stars seems to be more pronounced for @xmath1  @xmath46@xmath2hz , which affects many helium - core burning stars . here",
    "it shows about a 30% difference ( figure  [ numax - kpmag - comb ] , right panels )",
    ". this difference could be due to both observation bias and errors in the galactic model prediction including predictions of oscillation amplitude and noise . while observational detection bias of @xmath1  would not be unexpected for the faintest stars , it is surprising to see the quite pronounced discrepancy for the bright stars .",
    "there were no strong indications of such pronounced discrepancies for the _ kepler _  red giant sample based on two years of data @xcite . however , due to the unknown selection function of the _",
    "kepler_giants direct comparisons can not be made with what we see here for the k2 c1 sample . in the bottom histogram",
    "we also do not see any strong dependence on @xmath16 for the difference between observed and predicted star counts , except perhaps a small tendency of relatively fewer observed stars fainter than @xmath47 , mostly arising from the before - mentioned slight difference in observed and predicted bias around the sloping dashed line ( faint low luminosity stars ) . also in this histogram , we see that the star counts agree quite well for @xmath1  @xmath48@xmath2hz  ( dotted curves ) in agreement with the above discussion .    in summary , we see an expected ( and largely predicted ) detection bias for faint low luminosity red giant branch stars and an apparent , but still not fully understood , difference between observed and predicted star counts for red clump stars across all magnitudes .",
    "another source to investigate completeness are the stellar classifications provided in the ecliptic plane input catalog @xcite .",
    "while the epic uses _ galaxia _  models for stellar parameter inference , the classifications are based on observational data such as reduced proper motions , colors , and spectroscopy , hence providing a more empirical test of the completeness of the seismic sample .",
    "based on simulations and comparisons to the kepler stellar properties catalog @xcite , the dwarf / giant misclassification fraction in the epic is expected to be @xmath495% .",
    "of the 1262 stars with a @xmath1  value reported by at least one pipeline , all but one are classified in the epic . of these",
    ", @xmath499% are classified as dwarfs in the epic ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath492% are classified as cool dwarfs ( @xmath50 , @xmath14  @xmath51k ) .",
    "we expect that the hotter dwarfs ( @xmath14  @xmath52k ) are significantly affected by classification errors in the epic , and hence account for most of the 5% misclassification fraction mentioned above .",
    "inspection of a 2mass color - color diagram showed that at least half of the dwarfs with @xmath14  @xmath51k indeed have colors consistent with cool dwarfs .",
    "we therefore conclude that the fraction of seismic stars in our sample which are in fact dwarfs ( with the seismic signal introduced e.g. by blended giants ) is @xmath492% .    using the epic to estimate",
    "the number of missing seismic detections is more difficult , since the typical epic @xmath13 uncertainties on the rgb can be as high as 0.3dex .",
    "nevertheless , the fraction of c1 gap targets which are classified with @xmath53 and @xmath1@xmath54 in the epic is @xmath4914% ( corresponding to @xmath55 stars ) , which is close to the observed fraction .",
    "this supports the conclusions based on the _ galaxia _  models that the seismic sample is near complete .",
    "we have analysed all ( 8,630 ) stars from the target list of the k2 galactic archaeology program , and report the detection of oscillations in about 1200 of them ; all red giants with @xmath56 . as a serendipitous , but valuable by - product of this analysis",
    ", we identify a set of roughly 7500 dwarfs ideally suited for exoplanet galactic exoplanet occurrence rate studies .    * as expected for the giants , we find that @xmath6  can not be determined robustly for all the helium - core burning stars despite them showing oscillations , with a robust measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "* however , somewhat unexpectedly we see a discrepancy in star counts between a galactic synthesis - model prediction and the lower number of observed giants with a detection of @xmath1  @xmath46@xmath2hz , hence affecting many of the helium - core burning stars .",
    "current evidence does not allow us to conclude to what degree this is caused by model error , including our ability to estimate oscillation amplitude and noise in the data , or by seismic detection bias against helium - core burning giants .",
    "this discrepancy clearly needs further investigation in future . *",
    "* one would go some way towards addressing this issue by applying the current seismic analysis pipelines on _ kepler _  data ` degraded ' to k2 quality ; meaning short time series and higher noise levels , although not all k2-specific noise properties are straightforward to simulate with _ kepler",
    "_  data . *",
    "* performing a visual inspection along the lines what we show here , but for a large randomly selected set of stars , irrespective of pipeline detection or not , could indicate how many oscillating giants that where completely missed by any of the automated pipeline algorithms . *",
    "* it would further help to look at different galactic population synthesis tools ( e.g. trilegal * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to probe into different directions of the galaxy using data from subsequent k2 campaigns , to investigate issues with the galactic model predictions .",
    "already published results from later campaigns also indicate reduced effects from spacecraft thruster firings , making a comparison with _ kepler _  data more informative . * * in addition , spectroscopic @xmath13 values from large unbiased samples of k2 gap targets will provide an important independent comparison to reveal detection biases in the seismic sample .",
    "* despite the known biases , it currently appears that the sample of oscillating giants with @xmath57 @xmath1/@xmath2hz  @xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath58@xmath2hz   ( figure  [ numax - histo ] , [ numax - kpmag - comb ] ) , provide a set of stars with little or no detection bias , especially if only @xmath1  is used ( for example in combination with gaia parallaxes ) .",
    "* we note that the c1 data does not suitably inform about detection bias towards luminous giants fainter than about @xmath59 . * finally , if users do not take our visual detection confirmation into account , we suggest to disregard all stars with @xmath1  within a few @xmath2hz  of the thruster firing frequency if an unbiased set of stars is required from the c1 seismic data reported here .    the k2 galactic archaeology program is supported by the national aeronautics and space administration under grant nnx16aj17 g issued through the k2 guest observer program",
