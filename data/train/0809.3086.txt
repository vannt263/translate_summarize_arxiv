    "in view of the rapid progress made in the fabrication and application of meta - materials @xcite , which often exhibit left - handed properties @xcite , a theoretical understanding of the striking optical effects associated with such materials is desirable .",
    "mainly in the past decade , phenomena such as negative refraction @xcite , superlenses @xcite , invisibility devices @xcite and the reversed doppler effect @xcite have been investigated and measured .",
    "of particular interest to the field of nano - technologies is the research on dispersion forces in the presence of meta - materials with specially tailored magneto - electric properties described by complex @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the casimir force between two magneto - electric plates @xcite , as well as that between anisotropic meta - materials @xcite have recently been addressed where particular attention was drawn to the question of whether attractive behavior can be turned into repulsion , an issue closely related to problem of stiction @xcite .",
    "whereas precision measurements of casimir forces between ordinary materials have already carried out @xcite an experimental confirmation of dispersion interactions in meta - materials remains to be done as a prospective task .",
    "we have recently investigated the resonant casimir  polder ( cp ) interaction of an excited atom near a superlens of left - handed material @xcite , finding that for very weak absorption the cp potential may be enhanced near the focal plane of the lens . in this article",
    "we study the resonant cp interaction near a magneto - electric half space ( sec .",
    "[ rvdw ] ) . endowed with an understanding of the behavior of the potential near a single interface",
    ", we then reexamine the superlens geometry in order to clarify whether focal - plane enhancement is a genuine left - handed effect or whether similar behavior can be observed with ordinary magnetoelectrics ( sec .",
    "[ plg ] ) .",
    "it has been recognized that the impact of the magneto - electric properties of the meta - material ( e.g.  left - handedness ) on dispersive interactions is much more pronounced for excited systems due to fact that selected frequencies ( i.e. , atomic transition frequencies ) contribute dominantly to the electromagnetic response . for an excited atom [ position @xmath2 , energy eigenstate @xmath3 , transition frequencies @xmath4 , electric - dipole transition matrix elements @xmath5 the off - resonant part of the interaction",
    "can often be neglected , so that the cp potential may be given as @xcite @xmath6 ( @xmath7 : unit step function , @xmath8 : scattering green tensor ) .",
    "consider first an atom placed in front of a magneto - electric half space ( at @xmath9 ) of permittivity @xmath0 and permeability @xmath1 . the associated scattering green tensor reads ( cf .",
    ", e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath10\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 [ @xmath12 , @xmath13 . the square root of @xmath14 has to be chosen such that @xmath15 for a passive medium .",
    "note that when the atom is embedded in a medium , local - field corrections need to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "substituting ( [ green ] ) into ( [ equ1 ] ) gives for the resonant cp potential @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "equation  ( [ ur2 ] ) can be further investigated analytically in the limits of short and long atom  interface separations . in the nonretarded regime where @xmath19 we can assume @xmath20 which leads to @xmath21 carrying out the integral in ( [ green ] ) gives @xmath22 unless the half space is purely magnetic , in which case @xmath23",
    "this shows that close to the surface , the resonant cp potential is attractive for @xmath24 and  in the case of a purely magnetic material   it is attractive for @xmath25 . in particular , for meta - materials with @xmath26 and/or @xmath27 , a repulsive near - surface behavior of the potential",
    "can be expected .    in the retarded regime @xmath28 , the main contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) is due to the stationary - phase point @xmath29 , so the reflection coefficients are approximated by @xmath30 after substituting ( [ r21r ] ) into ( [ green ] ) , the integral can be carried out and keeping only the leading order in @xmath31 , the retarded cp potential  ( [ ur2 ] ) takes the form @xmath32 where the second equality holds for strongly electric and magnetic half spaces , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the retarded potential is dominated by an oscillating term of decreasing amplitude where purely electric and purely magnetic materials give rise to potentials of different signs .    in fig .",
    "[ epsfig ] , we show the resonant potential  ( [ ur2 ] ) [ together with eqs .",
    "( [ green])([beta ] ) ] for purely electric ( above ) and purely magnetic ( below ) materials . as expected from the retarded limit , the potential at large distances is governed by decaying oscillations whose phase depends on the signs and electric / magnetic nature of the medium response .",
    "the amplitude is of these oscillations is largest for large negative @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the figure confirms the predicted attraction ( repulsion ) in the nonretarded regime for @xmath35 and further reveals that a repulsive potential barrier can form for @xmath36 or @xmath37 ; in the latter case , it is even more pronounced .    as a second example we have considered a genuinely magneto - electric half space with different signs for @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ metafig ] ) .",
    "the strongest oscillations are seen in the case of a meta - material with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( or vice versa ) , where the oscillations have opposite sings in the two cases , as predicted from eq .",
    "( [ uret ] ) .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is very weak for a left - handed material or an ordinary one with @xmath40 .",
    "resonant cp potential of a two - level atom in front of an electric ( above ) and magnetic ( below ) meta - material half space for different strengths of the electric / magnetic properties .",
    "the atomic dipole moment is oriented parallel to the surface and we have assumed @xmath41 . ]",
    "resonant cp potential of a two - level atom in front of a magneto - electric meta - material half - space .",
    "assumptions of fig .",
    "[ epsfig ] apply . ]",
    "consider an excited atom placed next to a meta - material superlens ( i.e. , a plate of thickness @xmath42 with @xmath43 ) bounded by a perfectly conducting mirror on the far side ( this arrangement was first suggested in ref .",
    "the reflection coefficients of the associated green tensor  ( [ green ] ) are given by @xmath44 we have discussed the associated resonant potential  ( [ ur2 ] ) in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as shown , for a perfect , nonabsorbing lens , the reflection coefficients reduce to @xmath45 and the the potential  ( [ equ1 ] ) takes the form @xmath46    & + \\left.2   \\left[\\cos(\\tilde{z})+\\tilde{z}\\sin(\\tilde{z})\\right ]    \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] [ @xmath47 .",
    "the atom is thus strongly attracted to the focal plane of the lens at ( @xmath48 ) where it coincides with its image ( which for @xmath49 is situated at @xmath50 ) .    for a more realistic absorbing lens , the potential no longer shows the unphysical divergence at the focal plane , but an enhanced attraction around the focal plane and thus away from the surface of the lens can still be found for sufficiently weak absorption .",
    "let us investigate whether enhanced attraction away from physical surfaces is an effect which is genuinely due to left - material properties .",
    "for that end , we have calculated the cp potential  ( [ ur2 ] ) [ together with eqs .",
    "( [ green ] ) , ( [ beta ] ) , ( [ r2-s ] ) and ( [ r2-p ] ) ] for a two - level atom near a weakly absorbing superlens and compared it with comparable righthanded meta - material slabs , with the results being displayed in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is seen that the superlens gives rise to enhanced attraction which sets in around the focal plane , while the righthanded materials do not give rise to such a behavior .",
    "instead , the highly transparent material @xmath51 leads to a weak oscillating potential which is entirely due to the mirror while the materials with different signs of @xmath33 and @xmath34 lead to near - surface potential barriers . as seen in sec .",
    "[ rvdw ] , the latter behavior is due to the negative @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .     with a perfect mirror at its far end .",
    "the atomic dipole moment is oriented perpendicular to the surface and we have assumed @xmath52 . ]    [ fig2 ]",
    "in this article we have studied the resonant cp potential of an excited atom in front of meta - material half space .",
    "we have shown that for long distances the potential exhibits attenuated oscillations , while close to the surface the potential becomes attractive or repulsive , depending on whether the absolute values of permittivity and permeability are larger or smaller than unity .",
    "furthermore , we have reconsidered the potential of an excited atom placed near a weakly absorbing left - handed planar superlens with a perfect mirror at the far end .",
    "a comparison with comparable righthanded meta - materials has shown that an enhanced superlens attraction away from the surface is genuinely due to the left - handed properties of the lens , while the potentials of righthanded materials closely resemble those of respective half spaces without the additional mirror .",
