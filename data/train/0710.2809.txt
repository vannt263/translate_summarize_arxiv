    "higgs boson couplings to vector bosons , heavy quarks and heavy leptons can in principle be measured by combining informations on different production and decay channels @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the higgs boson coupling to @xmath0 quarks seems presently quite challenging . on the one hand ,",
    "the sm higgs production channel @xmath4 is overwhelmed by the main production process @xmath5 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , processes involving the @xmath6 coupling via the higgs decay @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 gev ) seem at the moment hard to manage , due to the large @xmath0 ( and , more generally , jet ) background expected from pure qcd processes .",
    "the @xmath7 decay in the higgs production via vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "it gives rise to four - jet final states , out of which two jets should be @xmath0-tagged .",
    "although the vbf final states have quite distinctive kinematical features ( i.e. , two forward jets with a typical transverse momentum of order @xmath9 plus a resonant @xmath0-jet pair produced centrally ) , different sources of qcd backgrounds and hadronic effects presently make the relevance of this channel for a @xmath6 coupling determination difficult to assess . for instance ,",
    "triggering on @xmath10 final states must confront with the corresponding large qcd four - jet trigger rate .",
    "the @xmath11 associated production , where the higgs boson is radiated by a top - quark pair , with subsequent @xmath7 decay , could also provide a @xmath6 coupling measurement .",
    "nevertheless , the recent inclusion of more reliable qcd background estimate and detector simulation in the corresponding signal analysis  @xcite , have lowered the expectations on the potential of this channel .    here",
    "we report on a further process that could help in determining the @xmath12 coupling , that was recently studied in @xcite ( where more details can be found ) .",
    "we consider the higgs boson production in vbf in association with a large transverse - momentum photon ( i.e. , @xmath13 gev ) emitted centrally ( i.e. , with pseudorapidity @xmath14 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 decays to @xmath17 , and , at the parton level , the final qcd partons are identified with the corresponding jets @xmath18 .",
    "disregarding the resonant contribution to the process coming from the @xmath19 production , the dominant feynman diagrams are the ones involving vbf ( as shown in figure  1 , where the higgs decay to @xmath17 is not shown ) .",
    "final states @xmath20 arising from photon radiation off one of the two @xmath0-quarks arising from the higgs boson decay [ via @xmath21 fall outside the experimental @xmath22 resolution window around the @xmath23 , due to the requirement of a large @xmath24 photon .",

    "fine structure constant @xmath27 that depletes production rates , gives a number of benefits @xcite    * the large ( critical ) rate for qcd multi - jet final states that characterizes the background for @xmath26 is depleted , too , by the electromagnetic coupling when requiring a further photon in the final state ; this is expected to improve triggering efficiencies of the detector ; * the large gluonic component entering the qcd background to the plain @xmath28 final state at parton level does not take part in the radiation of a large @xmath24 photon , so making part of the potential background to @xmath29 _ inactive _ ; * further dynamical _ coherence _ effects dramatically suppress the radiation of a photon in the irreducible qcd background to @xmath30 , when the photon is central ( i.e. emitted outside the typical radiation cone around the initial / final quark legs , for quarks scattered in the @xmath31-channel ) ; * a similar _ coherence _ effect depletes the @xmath32 amplitudes ( involving neutral currents ) with the respect to the @xmath3 ones ( involving charged currents ) in figure  1 , increasing the relative sensitivity to the @xmath3 coupling in the radiative channel ; then , a measurement of the @xmath30 rate could lead to a combined determination of the higgs boson couplings to @xmath0 quarks and @xmath33 vector bosons , with less contamination from the @xmath32 coupling uncertainties ; * the requirement of a central photon strongly reduces the background arising from alternative higgs boson production processes , such as the one coming from the virtual gluon fusion @xmath34 diagrams , with a photon radiated off any external quark leg .    in the following",

    "indeed , the rates for @xmath52 and its background would be related to a @xmath53 rescaling of the rates for the @xmath54 signal and its background , respectively , keeping the @xmath55 ratio approximately stable . on the other hand , both the @xmath56 signal and its background statistics would decrease according to the rescaling factor @xmath53 . consequently ,",
    "if @xmath57 is the signal significance for the vbf process ( with ) without a central photon , the signal significance for @xmath52 would fall down as @xmath58 with respect to the basic vbf process .",
    "this would question the usefulness of considering the @xmath59 variant of the @xmath54 process , apart from the expected improvement in the triggering efficiency of the detectors due to the lower background rates .    in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] , one can see that the qed naive expectations do not necessarily apply when restricted regions of phase space are considered ( as discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "we see that the naive qed rescaling fails for the main background processes @xmath60 , whose rate drops by about a factor 3000 after requiring a central photon , due to destructive interference ( _ coherence _ ) effects discussed in @xcite .",
    "since , on the other hand , the signal cross section roughly follows the naive qed rescaling @xmath61 , the requirement of a central photon gives rise to a dramatic increase ( by more than one order of magnitude ) in the @xmath55 ratio .",

    "the analysis presented above does not include parton - shower effects .",
