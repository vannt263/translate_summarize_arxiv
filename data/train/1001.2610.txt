    "hagedorn states , heavy resonances that follow an exponential mass spectrum , have been recently shown to play an important role close to the qcd critical temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "they have been used to find a low @xmath1 in the hadron gas phase @xcite , which nears the string theory bound @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "calculations of the trace anomaly including hagedorn states also fit recent lattice results well and correctly describe the minimum @xmath9 near the phase transition found on the lattice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , estimates for the bulk viscosity including hagedorn states in the hadron gas phase indicate that @xmath10 increases near @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recent calculations using hagedorn states to drive hadrons into chemical equilibrium indicate that hadrons do not need to be born in equilibrium at rhic @xcite .",
    "this comes about because hagedorn states allow for very short chemical equilibration times , which were previously not seen using only binary collisions .",
    "previously , it was assumed that anti - baryons and anti - hyperons were already in chemical equilibrium following the phase transition from qgp to the hadron gas phase because gluon fusion more efficiently produces strange quarks .",
    "however , reactions including hagedorn states may also reproduce anti - baryons and anti - hyperons within the lifetime of a fireball .    because of the importance of hagedorn states close to @xmath0 it is possible that they would have an effect on thermal fits , which are computed within statistical models to reproduce hadron yield ratios in heavy ion collisions @xcite . for au+au collisions at rhic@xmath11 at @xmath3 gev ,",
    "specifically , estimates for the chemical freeze - out temperature and baryon chemical potential range from @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev @xcite . moreover , because hagedorn states are dependent on the limiting hagedorn temperature @xmath14 , a relationship between the chemical freeze - out temperature and the critical temperature can be found by including hagedorn states in thermal fits @xcite .",
    "this uniquely gives us the ability to distinguish between different critical temperature regions depending on the quality of the fit obtained using the statistical model .",
    "thus , in this paper we explore the possibility of including hagedorn states into thermal fits .",
    "in this paper we use a grand - canonical model to describe the particle densities from which we can calculate the corresponding ratios as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "hagedorn states are included in our hadron resonance gas model via the exponentially increasing density of states @xcite @xmath15^{\\frac{5}{4}}}e^{\\frac{m}{t_{h}}}dm,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 gev and @xmath17 gev . we consider two different lattice results for @xmath0 : @xmath18 mev @xcite ( the corresponding fit to the trace anomaly is then @xmath19 , @xmath20 gev , and @xmath21 ) , which uses an almost physical pion mass , and @xmath22 mev @xcite ( the corresponding fit to the energy density leads to @xmath23 , @xmath20 gev , and @xmath24 ) . both are shown and discussed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we take into account repulsive interactions using volume corrections @xcite that are thermodynamically consistent .",
    "note that @xmath25 is a free parameter based upon the idea of the mit bag constant . also , we include all the known hadrons below with mass below 2 gev in our analysis .",
    "note that @xmath25 is a free parameter based upon the idea of the mit bag constant .",
    "note that due to the volume corrections @xmath26 for a discussion on this see @xcite .    in our model we do not just consider the direct number of hadrons but also the indirect number that comes from other resonances .",
    "for example , for pions we consider also the contribution from resonances such as @xmath27 s , @xmath28 s , and etc .",
    "the number of indirect hadrons can be calculated from the branching ratios for each individual species in the particle data book @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is also a contribution from the hagedorn states to the total number of pions , kaons , and so on as described in @xcite .",
    "thus the total number of  effective \" pions can be described by @xmath29 whereas the total number of  effective \" protons , kaons , or lambdas ( generalized as @xmath30 ) can be described by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the average number of @xmath33 p s , k s , or @xmath34 s . here",
    "@xmath35 is the total number of each species and @xmath36 is the average number of pions that each hagedorn state decays into . to determine @xmath32 we use the multiplicities in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite from the microcanonical model in @xcite such that @xmath37 clearly , they are all dependent on the mass of the @xmath38 hagedorn state .    in order to get an idea of the quality of the thermal fits ,",
    "we define @xmath4 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is our ratio of hadron yields calculated within our thermal model whereas @xmath41 is the experimentally measured value of the hadron yield with its corresponding error @xmath42 . then , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are varried until the minimum @xmath4 is found .",
    "we use the experimental data from both star @xcite and phenix @xcite at mid - rapidity for au+au collisions at rhic at @xmath45=200 gev .",
    "specifically , we observe the ratios : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "all of which are calculated by star @xcite .",
    "however , only @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are given by phenix . because there is such a significant difference between @xmath50 from phenix and star",
    "we choose only the value from star so that we can compare are results to @xcite where they also exclude @xmath50 from phenix .",
    "it should be noted that ref .",
    "@xcite includes more ratios than we do such as multi - strange particles and resonances , which are not included in this paper .",
    "this is because the purpose of this paper is not to confirm their results , which have already been confirmed in @xcite , but rather to compare thermal fits that include the contribution of hagedorn states and those that exclude them .",
    "we show the thermal fits for a hadron gas excluding hagedorn states in fig .  [",
    "fig : nohs ] , where @xmath52 mev , @xmath53 mev , and @xmath54 .",
    "this is almost identical to @xcite where @xmath55 and @xmath56 mev .",
    "gev without hagedorn states with mass above 2 gev .",
    ", width=264 ]    the inclusion of hagedorn states is our primary interest . starting with the fit for the rbc - bielefeld collaboration , we obtain @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 mev , and @xmath59 , which is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hs ] .",
    "the @xmath4 is actually slightly smaller than in fig .",
    "[ fig : nohs ] .",
    ", width=264 ]    when we consider the lattice results from bmw , which are at the lower end of the critical temperature spectrum where @xmath22 mev , we find @xmath60 mev , @xmath61 mev , and @xmath62 .",
    "the lower critical temperature seems to have a significant impact on the thermal fit .",
    "the lower @xmath4 is due to the larger contribution of hagedorn states at at @xmath60 mev , which is much closer to @xmath0 .",
    "the difference in the @xmath4 s for bmw and rbc - bielefeld collaboration is directly related to the contribution of hagedorn states in the model . because the rbc - bielefeld critical temperature region is significantly higher than its corresponding chemical freeze - out temperature the contribution of the hagedorn states is minimal @xmath63 4 - 11@xmath64 whereas the contribution from the hagedorn states is @xmath65 for @xmath66 mev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the inclusion of hagedorn states should not only provide a better fit but they also affect the chemical freeze - out temperature and the baryonic chemical potential .",
    "the more mesonic hagedorn states are present the larger @xmath43 becomes .",
    "furthermore , our fits also have higher @xmath44 s than seen in the fit without the effects of hagedorn states .",
    "our results for thermal fits without hagedorn states concur well with other thermal fit models @xcite where the chemical freeze - out temperature ( @xmath52 mev ) is almost identical and the baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath53 mev ) is only slightly larger .",
    "the thermal fit with the known particles in the particle data group provides a decent fit with @xmath54 .",
    "however , the inclusion of hagedorn states provides an even better fit to the experimental data .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath62 , @xmath60 mev , and @xmath61 mev for the bmw collaboration while for the rbc - bielefeld collaboration we obtained @xmath59 , @xmath57 mev , and @xmath67 mev .",
    "this provides further evidence @xcite that hagedorn states should be included in a description of hadronic matter near @xmath0 .",
    "since the chemical freeze - out temperature was found to increase from @xmath68 mev to roughly @xmath69 mev ( rbc - bielefeld ) or @xmath70 mev ( bmw ) when including hagedorn states , this exemplifies the degree of uncertainty in extracting chemical freeze - out thermodynamical parameters by means of such thermal analyzes .",
