    "in analyzing data with known errors it is conventional to first consider a weighted mean statistic .",
    "this method yields a goodness of fit criterion that can be a valuable diagnostic tool .    the standard formula ( see , e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) for the weighted mean of cosmological parameter @xmath27 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 are the central values and one standard deviation errors of the @xmath32 measurements .",
    "the weighted mean standard deviation of cosmological parameter @xmath27 is @xmath33 one can also compute the goodness of fit @xmath34 , @xmath35 since this method assumes gaussian errors , @xmath36 has expected value unity and error @xmath37 . hence , the number of standard deviations that @xmath36 deviates from unity is a measure of good - fit and is given as @xmath38 a large value of @xmath39 could be an indication of unaccounted - for systematic error , the presence of correlations between the measurements , or the invalidity of the gaussian assumption .",
    "the second statistical method we use is median statistics .",
    "this method makes fewer assumptions than the weighted mean method , and so can be used in cases when the weighted mean technique can not . for a detailed description of the median statistics technique see @xcite . in summary , if we assume that the given measurements are : 1 ) statistically independent ; and , 2 ) have no systematic error for the data set as a whole ( as we also assume for weighted mean statistics ) , then as the number of measurements , @xmath40 , increases to infinity , the median will reveal itself as a true value .",
    "this median is independent of measurement error @xcite , which is an advantage if the errors are suspect .",
    "this is also a disadvantage that results in a larger uncertainty for the median than for the weighted mean , because the information in the error bar is not used .",
    "if 1 ) is true then any value in the data set has a 50@xmath6 chance of being above or below the true median value . as described in @xcite , if",
    "@xmath40 independent measurements @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , are taken then the probability of exactly @xmath15 measurements being higher ( or lower ) than the true median is @xmath43 it is interesting to note that for large @xmath40 the expectation value of the distribution width , @xmath44 , of the true median is @xmath45 , with a standard deviation @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "of course , as @xmath40 increases to infinity , a gaussian distribution is reached and median statistics recovers the usual standard deviation proportionality to @xmath47 .",
    "since both weighted mean and median statistics techniques have individual benefits , we analyze the compilation of data for 12 parameters from @xcite using both methods .",
    "our results are shown in table [ table : wa and med results ] . among other things ,",

    "column 5 of table [ table : wa and med results ] lists @xmath39 , the number of standard deviations the weighted mean goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath36 deviates from unity , see eq .  ( [ eq : n ] ) . in all cases @xmath39 is much greater than unity , indicating that the weighted mean results can not be trusted . in the case of the hubble constant",

    "measurements @xcite or different cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy observations @xcite . ]",
    "perhaps a similar effect explains the large @xmath39 values for some of the other parameters here . in any case , for our purpose here , the important point is that the weighted mean technique can not be used to derive a summary estimate by combining together the different measurements tabulated by @xcite for each cosmological parameter .",
