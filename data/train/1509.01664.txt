    "modified @xmath0 gravity has become one of the most popular mechanisms to generate a late accelerated expansion in the universe without the need of introducing new fields  @xcite .",
    "it was also one of the first consistent models for early inflation  @xcite . during the past fifteen years or so",
    ", several specific @xmath0 models have been thoroughly analyzed in many scenarios , but only a few of them can survive the classical tests ( e.g. solar system , binary pulsar ) while predicting the correct accelerating expansion , and in general , a successful cosmological model , both at the background and at the perturbative level .",
    "therefore , it is still unclear until what extent this kind of alternative theories of gravity can recover _ all _ the successes of general relativity ( gr ) while making new testable predictions .    as concern",
    "black hole solutions , the situation of @xmath0 gravity can , in some sense , differ from gr , and in other sense be almost the same .",
    "the last statement is related with the content of section  [ sec : theory ] about the existence of the same kind of vacuum black - hole solutions found in gr , while the former concerns the existence of hairy solutions , or lack thereof , that we analyze in all the rest of the paper .",
    "perhaps the first and simplest theorem concerning bh solutions in gr was the birkhoff s theorem ( bt ) . roughly speaking",
    ", this theorem establishes that in vacuum all spherically symmetric ( ss ) spacetimes are also static , and those that are asymptotically flat ( af ) are represented by a one - parameter family of solutions , namely , the ubiquitous schwarzschild solution , where the parameter is interpreted as the ( adm ) _ mass _ @xmath1 of the spacetime ( see  @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "remarkably , when including an electric field , the ss solution can be extended as to include the charge @xmath2 of the bh , it is the well known two - parameter reissner ",
    "nordstrm ( rn ) solution . in the af case ,",
    "both the schwarzschild and the rn solution are @xmath3 solutions of the einstein s field equations ( also termed _",
    "ricci flat _ solutions ) .",
    "when including a cosmological constant @xmath4 , the schwarzschild and rn black holes become a two and three - parameter family respectively , and the solutions are asymptotically de sitter ( ads ) or asymptotically anti de sitter ( aads ) , depending if @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively .    in the decade of 1960 s , motivated by the discovery of the kerr solution , several theorems (",
    "notably , the _ uniqueness theorems _ ) were established for stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes both in vacuum and with an electromagnetic field ( see  @xcite for details and reviews ) .",
    "one of the main consequences of those theorems is that in the af case the solutions of the einstein field equations under such symmetries are characterized _ only _ by three parameters , the mass @xmath1 , the charge @xmath2 , and the angular momentum @xmath7 of the bh .",
    "these solutions are known as the kerr ",
    "newman family , which extends the schwarzschild and rn black holes to more general spacetimes : stationary and axisymmetric . due to the apparent simplicity of such solutions ,",
    "wheeler established the so called _ no hair conjecture _ , a statement that `` doomed '' all possible stationary afbh solutions from having any other parameters than those three ( @xmath8 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "this conjecture has been reinforced thereafter by the elaboration of several _ no - hair _ theorems ( nht s ) that forbid the existence of bh solutions with more parameters associated with other kinds of matter fields ( see  @xcite for a review ) . among such theorems",
    "one can mention those that include several kinds of scalar fields . eventually , this conjecture proved to be `` false '' , for instance , within the einstein  yang  mills system  @xcite , and einstein - scalar - field system with `` exotic '' potentials that can be negative  @xcite . or when including rotation like in the einstein - boson - field system  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , since most , if not all of such _ hairy _ solutions are unstable  , the community ( or at least part of it ) consider those solutions as _ weak _ counterexamples to the wheeler s no - hair conjecture .",
    "therefore , it has been tantalizing to extend the conjecture in the following more precise , although still informal , statement : _ the only stable stationary afbh s are within the kerr ",
    "newman family _  @xcite .",
    "the proposal of alternative theories of gravity as a possible solution to the dark - matter and dark - energy problems and to other theoretical problems ( e.g. inflation , gravity renormalization ) has motivated people to generalize several of the theorems and conjectures mentioned above , and which pertain to gr , to the realm of other modified - gravity proposals .",
    "while it is out of the scope of the present paper to review all such attempts , we shall simply focus on @xmath0 metric gravity . unless otherwise stated , by @xmath0 gravity we mean a theory that departs from the gr function @xmath9 .    as concerns",
    "this kind of theory , a large amount of analysis has been devoted to establish an analogue of the bt for the ss situation  @xcite . however , the reality is that no rigorous bt exists today in @xmath0 gravity , as far as we are aware . in fact",
    ", if one such theorem were proved , certainly should be restricted to some specific @xmath0 models .",
    "moreover , the theorem should establish at least four things , upon fixing the boundary conditions ( i.e. regularity and asymptotic conditions ) : 1 ) _ staticity : _ the only spherically symmetric solutions in vacuum [ i.e. without any matter field associated with the standard model of particle physics or any other field that is not associated with the lagrangian @xmath0 ] are necessarily static ( i.e. the existence of a static killing field should be proved from the spherically symmetric assumptions ) ; 2 ) _ existence : _ the existence of an exact static spherically symmetric ( sss ) solution in vacuum ; 3 ) _ uniqueness : _ the sss solution found in point ` 2 ) ' is the only solution in vacuum ( or prove otherwise ) ; 4 ) the conditions under which the solution in point ` 2 ) ' matches or not the exterior solution of an sss extended body .",
    "so far , in vacuum only a few bh exact solutions exist in @xmath0 gravity , and those that are genuine af , ads or aads correspond simply to the same kind of solutions found in gr , where @xmath11 everywhere in the spacetime ( with @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 , respectively ) .",
    "it is unclear if other solutions exist with the same kind of asymptotics but with a varying @xmath15 in the domain of outer communication of the bh .",
    "we shall elaborate more about this point below to be more precise .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of matter ( i.e. a star - like object ) , it is possible to find sss solutions where @xmath15 can vary in space  @xcite , however , those solutions are not exact , but given only numerically , and it is unclear if the exterior part ( i.e. the vacuum part ) of those solutions is the same solution found when matter is totally absent in the spacetime , if it exists at all , as it happens in gr where the exterior solution of extended objects under such symmetries is always given by the vacuum schwarzschild solution  . now , despite the absence of such bt , some nht s have been proved in this kind of theories . in order to do so",
    ", people have resorted to the equivalence between a certain class of @xmath0 models ( notably , those where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the subindex indicates differentiation ) with scalar - tensor theories ( stt ) .",
    "the point is that one performs a conformal transformation from the original _ jordan frame _ to the so - called _ einstein frame _ where the conformal metric appears to be coupled minimally to gravity and a new scalar - field @xmath18 emerges , where @xmath19 , which is also coupled minimally to the conformal metric but endowed with an `` exotic '' potential @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the available nht s constructed for the einstein - scalar - field system in gr can be applied for these theories as well ( see section  [ sec : stt ] ) , notably in vacuum , and when the spacetime is af and the potential satisfies the condition @xmath21",
    "@xcite for the potential .",
    "this proof is similar to bekenstein s  @xcite which assumes only _ stationarity _ as opposed to _",
    "staticity_. ] .",
    "we stress that the applicability of such nht s is possible because the non - minimal coupling between the scalar field @xmath18 and the matter fields that usually appears under the einstein frame obviously vanishes in the absence of the matter .",
    "the only caveat of this method is that the potential @xmath20 is not given a priori but is the result of the specific @xmath0 model considered ab initio , and thus , @xmath20 can be negative or even not well defined ( i.e. it can be multivalued ) , which in turn can jeopardize the use of the nht s .",
    "consequently , the existing nht s in @xmath0 gravity can reduce the kind of afsssbh solutions that are available in some specific models , but do not rule out completely the absence of _ geometric hair_. in this context , by ( geometric ) _ hairy _ solutions within @xmath0 gravity we mean afsssbh solutions where the ricci scalar is not _ trivial _",
    "( i.e. constant ) , but rather a function that interpolates non - trivially between the horizon and spatial infinity .",
    "thus , when the condition @xmath21 fails and the nht s are not applicable one can resort to a numerical analysis for evidence about the existence of such hair or its absence thereof . at this respect it is important to stress that regularity conditions have to be imposed at the inner boundary , namely , at the bh horizon @xmath22 in order to prevent the presence of singularities there . in section  [ sec : regcond ] and",
    "appendix  [ sec : regcond2 ] we obtain such regularity conditions and then in sections  [ sec : expmodels ] and  [ sec : numerical ] we present analytical and numerical evidence , respectively , showing that hairy solutions are absent in several specific @xmath0 models proposed as dark - energy alternatives in cosmology .",
    "in particular , the models considered in section  [ sec : numerical ] are precisely those for which the nht s can not be applied as the corresponding potential @xmath20 can be negative or is not even well defined . on the other hand ,",
    "when such hairy solutions are absent , one may still find the trivial solution @xmath23 for which the field equations reduce to the einstein field equations with an effective cosmological constant @xmath24 , and an effective gravitational constant @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a solution of an algebraic equation involving @xmath0 and @xmath27 .",
    "this includes the case where @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , in such circumstances , all the best known bh solutions found in gr exist also in @xmath0 gravity simply by replacing the usual cosmological constant @xmath4 by @xmath29 , and the newton s gravitational constant @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "in view of this we shall argue in section  [ sec : theory ] that such solutions are so trivial ( i.e. trivial in the context of @xmath0 gravity ) that almost nothing new arise from them .    finally , we mention that some `` non - trivial '' exact sssbh solutions have been reported in the literature as a result of very ad hoc @xmath0 models  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding such solutions _ can not _ be considered as hairy solutions because they have unusual asymptotics , and therefore , the corresponding `` hairless '' solution @xmath32 ( including the ricci - flat solution ) does not even exist with the same kind of asymptotics .",
    "we shall discuss one such solution in section  [ sec : exactsols ] .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] we discuss in a general setting the conditions for the existence of several trivial bh solutions . in section  [ sec : sss ] we focus on sss spacetimes and provide the corresponding differential equations to find bh solutions .",
    "we also discuss some exact solutions that will be used later to test a numerical code constructed to solve the equations .",
    "the boundary conditions appropriate to solve these equations with the presence of a bh are given in section  [ sec : sss ] in form of _ regularity conditions _ at the horizon .",
    "no - hair theorems and the properties of @xmath0 gravity formulated in the einstein frame are analyzed in section  [ sec : stt ] . in that section",
    "we also provide strong numerical evidence about the absence of hair for several @xmath0 models when the nht s do not apply .",
    "our conclusions and final remarks are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "several appendices at the end of the article complement the ideas of the main sections .",
    "the general action for a @xmath0 theory of gravity is given by    @xmath33 = \\!\\ !",

    "the first term corresponds to the modified gravity action , while the second is the usual action for the matter , where @xmath38 represents schematically the matter fields .",
    "the field equation arising from the action  ( [ f(r ) ] ) under the metric approach is @xmath39 where @xmath27 stands for @xmath40 ( we shall use similar notation for higher derivatives ) , @xmath41 is the covariant dalambertian and @xmath42 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter resulting from the variation of the matter action in  ( [ f(r ) ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward , although a non - trivial result , to show that the conservation equation @xmath43 holds also in this case ( see appendix  [ sec : consemt ] for a proof ) . in turn , this latter leads to the geodesic equation for free - fall particles @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the weak - equivalence principle ( for point test particles ) is also incorporated in this theory as well .",
    "actually @xmath0 metric gravity preserves all the axioms of gr but the one that assumes that the field equations for the metric @xmath45 must be of second order .",
    "clearly the only case where this happens is for @xmath9 , which leads to gr plus a cosmological constant ( hereafter gr@xmath4 ) .",

    "however , in this paper we shall sometimes relax these two assumptions in order to explore its consequences for the sake of finding bh solutions .    in vacuum , that is when @xmath53 , or more generally , in the presence of matter fields where @xmath54 , like in electromagnetism or yang  mills theory , eq .",
    "( [ tracer ] ) admits in principle the trivial exact solution @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a solution of the algebraic equation @xmath57/f_{rr}=0 $ ] .",
    "in particular , if @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as often happens in potentially viable @xmath0 models , then @xmath56 is an algebraic solution of @xmath60 that we call @xmath26 . for such kind of solutions the field",
    "( [ fieldeq3 ] ) reduces to @xmath61 where @xmath62 we assume @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , the condition @xmath64 is an _ stability _ condition that is usually imposed in order to avoid exponentially growing modes when perturbing around the value @xmath65 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if there exists other value @xmath11 , that we call @xmath66 ( in order to avoid confusion with @xmath26 ) such that @xmath67 blows up at @xmath68 , but @xmath69 then @xmath66 can be also a possible trivial solution of eq .",
    "( [ tracer ] ) .",
    "however , in such a case one must be extremely cautious as in eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq3 ] ) may appear products of the sort @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) .",
    "even if such a product is finite , namely zero , still the interpretation of such solution would be problematic as @xmath72 would be singular everywhere . at",
    "what extent such `` singularity '' is physical , is something that one should clarify . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exactsols ] , we shall be dealing with an sss solution where the ricci scalar is not constant but @xmath73 as @xmath74 .",
    "hence , in that example @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 as @xmath74 .",
    "however , these pathologies , as peculiar as they may be , does not concern us too much in this article , since we will be mainly interested in situations where they are absent .",
    "now , in the particular and simplest scenario where @xmath65 is one of the trivial solutions of eq .",
    "( [ tracer ] ) , we see that the field equation ( [ einsred ] ) corresponds to gr with the usual `` bare '' cosmological constant @xmath4 and the bare newton s",
    "constant @xmath30 replaced by @xmath29 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "therefore , in that occurrence all the solutions that exist in gr exist in @xmath0 gravity as well when taking into account the above replacements .",
    "in particular , the afbh solutions with @xmath3 that exist in gr , like the kerr ",
    "newman family and its sss limit , exist also in @xmath0 gravity if @xmath78 , i.e. , if @xmath79 . on the other hand , the de sitter or anti - de sitter bh solutions associated with the kerr ",
    "newman family with a cosmological constant  @xcite exist also in @xmath0 gravity if @xmath80 .",
    "it is note that bh solutions @xmath81 , which from the point of view of @xmath0 gravity are _ trivial _ , have been systematically reported in the literature as something new or special ( e.g. see refs .",
    "however , as we just showed , the existence of such solutions stems from the fact that @xmath26 exists in various @xmath0 models , like the ones we consider in section  [ sec : expmodels ] . in turn",
    ", the existence of such a trivial solution is just a standard demand for @xmath0 theories to produce a late acceleration expansion : the cosmological constant @xmath29 emerge while the universe evolves towards the solution @xmath82 as the universe expands and matter dilutes .",
    "so nothing exceptional , astonishing or radically different from the already known bh solutions in gr are to be expected in this kind of trivial solutions in @xmath0 gravity . furthermore , and as a consequence of these remarks , the bekenstein  hawking entropy defined for such bh s , has @xmath31 instead of @xmath30 in the formula .",
    "that is , the modified entropy is @xmath83  @xcite , where @xmath84 is the area of the bh event horizon , instead of just @xmath85 .",
    "let us consider now the `` odd '' scenario where @xmath26 is such that @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . then eq .",
    "( [ tracer ] ) admits @xmath88 as one possible trivial solution . nonetheless , the possible solutions for the metric that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq3 ] ) _ degenerate _ and a whole spectrum of solutions can emerge , besides the usual af vacuum solutions mentioned above .",
    "such solutions are _ all _ the possible solutions of the einstein equation @xmath89 compatible with a _ null",
    "_ ricci scalar @xmath88 .",
    "more specifically , if one considers an @xmath0 model in vacuum such that @xmath90 at @xmath3 ( implying in turn @xmath91 ) but assuming @xmath92 , then eq .  ( [ tracer ] ) is solved trivially .",
    "moreover the field eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq3 ] ) in vacuum reduce to @xmath93 which is trivially satisfied for @xmath94 even if @xmath95 .",
    "thus , in that instance the model admits unexpectedly all the possible solutions associated with the non - vacuum einstein equation @xmath89 compatible with @xmath96 .",
    "now , given such scenario one has to deal with a problematic interpretation of the new global quantities that appear in the bh solutions as integration constants since in reality we are dealing with an @xmath0 model in vacuum . in non - vacuum",
    "gr the global quantities ( other than @xmath1 and @xmath7 ) are ascribed to properties associated with the matter described by @xmath42 ( like the electric charge @xmath2 or the nodes of the yang ",
    "mills field ) .",
    "therefore the same quantities would appear in this degenerate scenario , but clearly they can not have the same interpretation in vacuum . in section  [ sec : expmodels ] within the framework of model 1 , we shall encounter one such example which is associated with the model @xmath97 . in this model",
    "@xmath3 is a trivial solution and clearly @xmath94 , thus all possible solutions of einstein equations with a traceless energy - momentum tensor are in principle allowed , for instance , afsss solutions .",
    "in fact , one such solution is exactly the analogue of the rn , where the roll of the charge is played by a new quantity that appears as an integration constant .",
    "this interesting situation was also analyzed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and remarked before in ref .",
    "we shall elaborate more about this in sections  [ sec : exactsols ] and  [ sec : expmodels ] , notably , concerning the issue of _ uniqueness _ and the bt .",
    "having clarified the fact that @xmath0 gravity naturally admits trivial bh solutions where @xmath98 everywhere , notably the ones with @xmath3 , and which correspond to the same solutions found in gr modulo a trivial redefinition of constants , the main goal of this paper is an effort to find afsss solutions where @xmath99 is a non - trivial solution of the field equations , where @xmath100 is some radial coordinate .",
    "this means that if such solution exists , @xmath99 should interpolate in a non - trivial manner between the event ( killing ) horizon of the bh and the asymptotic region .",
    "if exist , this is what we might call a _ hairy _ solution . in order to find such a solution we enforce suitable regularity conditions at the horizon .",
    "these conditions provide a very specific form of derivatives of several variables at the horizon , notably , the first derivative of the ricci scalar .",
    "these regularity conditions are extremely important as they prevent the presence of bh solutions that are pathological at the horizon .",
    "in particular , they prevent a singularity in the scalar - degree of freedom at the horizon , a singularity that would be otherwise considered as _",
    "physical _ as opposed to a coordinate singularity . in section",
    "[ sec : regcond ] and in appendix  [ sec : regcond2 ] we provide such conditions in its full form and compare them with similar regularity conditions reported first in  @xcite , but amended in  @xcite .",
    "examples of such pathologies ( singularities ) are common in stt when using conformal methods to generate sss exact solutions without enforcing the regularity condition of the scalar field at the bh horizon  @xcite .",
    "thus , the fact that the field equations may not be satisfied at the horizon in those examples cast serious doubts about its relevance as genuine counterexamples to the no - hair conjecture .",

    "two final remarks are in order .",
    "the first one concerns the deficit angle solution  ( [ gfrsz ] ) .",

    "however , given such a power expansion , one can invert and write @xmath259 , to obtain a differential equation for @xmath0 and @xmath15 solely , which when solved provides ( [ frsz ] ) .",
    "this kind of `` tricks '' , which are also common to find exact solutions in gr with exotic sources  @xcite , have been applied in modified theories of gravity in the past  @xcite .",
    "physically , one usually proceeds in the opposite way we just described .",
    "that is , one constructs or proposes an explicit @xmath0 model in order to fit some observations , for instance , in cosmology , and then one asks if such a model admits or not an exact solution in one or other scenario . at this regard , and as a second remark related with our comment at the end of the previous section , we mention that almost all physically viable @xmath0 models admit the trivial solutions @xmath154 given by the schwarzschild  de sitter / anti - de sitter solution eqs .",

    ", one can turn to the nht s and see whether they apply or not for the @xmath0 model at hand .",
    "since we are interested precisely in finding sss black holes in vacuum , we can thus exploit this equivalence to see if hair is absent or if it can exist .",
    "thus , given a specific @xmath0 model , we carry out the following protocol : 1 ) we check if the model allows a `` trivial '' solution @xmath3 ( leading to schwarzschild solution ) .",
    "if the model does , then it means that the model is a priori able of allowing af hairy solutions ( i.e. solutions where @xmath15 would be a non - trivial function of @xmath100 that interpolates from the event horizon , with value @xmath117 , to spatial infinity where @xmath3 ) .",

    "we are therefore confident that our expressions are correct and so we enforced them in the numerical treatment presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",

    "2 ) the condition for the second legendre transformation can be imposed in the action by considering @xmath678 as a lagrange multiplier , so that the variation with respect to @xmath301 leads to @xmath312 .",
    "this is the formal construction when treating @xmath0 theories as stt , and in practice it is achieved by taking the action  ( [ jordanf ] ) .    in the following",
