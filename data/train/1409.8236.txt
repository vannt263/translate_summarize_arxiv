    "the investigation of gaseous flows through tight porous media has drawn huge attention because of its practical importance when dealing with extraction of hydrocarbon gases from unconventional gas reservoirs , such as shale gas and coal bed methane reservoirs .",
    "the quantitative analysis of the gas flow may be needed for environmental protection , for example in the areas of contaminant transport and remediation in the unsaturated zone .",
    "there is considerable number of results , indicating that the the range of applicability of conventional darcy s law has many limitations due to the nature of the porous medium and peculiarities of the flow regimes @xcite.that is why investigation of deviations from darcy s law becomes a topic of special interest in many studies and applications.there can be distinguished several cases , where the equations , describing gas flow through the porous medium , become non - linear and deviate from the darcy s law .",
    "firstly , let us look at the violation of darcy s law in the case , where gas velocity is relatively high .",
    "this class of flows is discussed in publications @xcite .",
    "it has been shown there that , where reynolds number for gas is big enough , linear correlation between the pressure gradient and velocity is no longer valid , and the nonlinear inertial term in the momentum equation can no longer be neglected .",
    "since we are interested in gas filtration , the nonlinear inertial effects must be considered along with the compressibility one .",
    "thus one - dimentional problem for the isothermal gas flow through a porous medium under the conditions of turbulent filtration was studied in @xcite .",
    "the solution was obtained in terms of cylindrical functions . in @xcite ,",
    "these results were extended to the case of axisymmetric motion .",
    "analytical solutions for one - dimensional problems of gas flow for quadratic resistance law were found in @xcite .    in paper @xcite ,",
    "the conditions for existence of self - similar solutions for the momentum equations , describing unsteady flow through a porous medium and incorporating the nonlinear inertial term , are examined . according to @xcite , self - similar solutions for non - darcy gas flow",
    "exist , if we assume a constant pressure or a constant mass velocity at the outface flow .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the interest in self - similar solutions is significant due to the fact that partial differential equations can be reduced to ordinary ones . as it was mentioned in @xcite , it is always worth searching for self - similar solutions before solving the problem numerically .    nonlinear effects associated with unsteady flows through a porous medium are analysed in paper @xcite . for unsteady flows of polytropic gas and slightly compressible fluid of power law behavior",
    "the author derived similar nonlinear parabolic equations for determining pressure distribution .",
    "the exact self - similar solutions in a closed form for the first boundary value problem were presented and discussed .",
    "the existence of a moving pressure front was established .",
    "it has turned out that pressure disturbances in polytropic gas ( or slightly compressible fluid of power law behavior ) flowing through a porous medium propagate with final velocity , which is a monotonically decreasing function of time .    in paper @xcite ,",
    "the authors discuss two classes of non - darcian flows through porous media , namely the turbulent flow of polytropic gases and the flow of non - newtonian power law fluids .",
    "the momentum equation , governing the gas flow , is the darcy ",
    "forcheimer equation , while the power law fluid flow model is based on a modified darcy s law taking into account the non - linear rheological effect on the flow behavior . in both cases",
    "the governing equations belong to a class of non - linear degenerate parabolic equations .",
    "the solutions of these equations have characteristics of a travel wave . in case , where the boundary conditions are power law functions of time ,",
    "the authors have managed to found self - similar solutions for the problem .    another no less important case of deviation from darcy s law is the situation , where the linear correlation between the pressure gradient and velocity is no longer valid due to the fact , that viscosity or permeability are no longer constants .",
    "that is discussed further in this paper .",
    "the fact that viscosity depends on pressure has been reported in many publications .",
    "we would like to make reference only to some of them , namely the early work by @xcite and some recent experiments in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in general one can not assume that permeability is independent of pressure .    for a gas flow through tight gas reservoirs the average free path of the gas molecules",
    "can no longer be neglected as compared to the average effective radius of rock pore throat .",
    "it makes possible for gas molecules to slip along pore surfaces .",
    "such gas slippage phenomenon creates an additional flux mechanism besides viscous flow .",
    "this effect yields an overestimated value of permeability of the gas being measured in comparison with the true absolute permeability of a liquid .",
    "the first studies of gas slippage in porous media were conducted by adzumi @xcite and later by klinkenberg @xcite , who proved that there exists relationship between the measured gas permeability @xmath0 and the mean core pressure @xmath1 : @xmath2    klinkenberg observed that the gas permeability approaches a limiting value at an infinite pressure @xmath1 .",
    "this limiting permeability @xmath3 is sometimes referred to as the equivalent liquid permeability , which is also called klinkenberg - corrected permeability .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 designates the gas slippage factor , which is a constant , related to the mean free path of the gas molecules at the pressure @xmath1 and effective pore radius .",
    "the subsequent works have focused on correlating parameters of the klinkenberg gas slippage factor @xmath4 and the equivalent liquid permeability @xmath3 . basing on the results of their core sample experiments , heid et al.@xcite and jones and owens",
    "@xcite proposed similar approach in the form of correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath3 : @xmath5 ( where the constants are the following : @xmath6 , @xmath7 in [ 3 ] and @xmath8 , @xmath9 in @xcite ) .",
    "later sampath and keighin @xcite studied core samples from a tight gas sand field and proposed a formula relating the gas slippage factor @xmath4 to the ratio of klinkenberg - corrected permeability @xmath3 to effective porosity @xmath10 : @xmath11 ( corresponding constants are the following : @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "this correlation is interesting since theoretical analysis , reported by @xcite and @xcite , establishes `` square - root '' correlation @xmath14 , which is close to @xmath15 , where @xmath13 .",
    "as time passed , numerous attempts were made to investigate gas flow in tight porous media .",
    "for example , javadpour et al .",
    "@xcite found that the behavior of the gas flow in shales deviates from the behavior described by the fick s and darcy s laws .",
    "publication @xcite presents results of a laboratory research into the effects of different velocity and pressure testing conditions on a steady - state flow measurements in tight gas sands .",
    "the authors also compared measurements of klinkenberg - corrected permeability using both conventional steady - state technique and unsteady - state permeameters . in the publication @xcite , intrinsic permeability of sedimentary rocks",
    "was measured by using the nitrogen gas and water as pore fluids .",
    "the permeability to the nitrogen gas was 2 to 10 times larger than to water on the same specimen .",
    "the permeability to the nitrogen gas decreases with an increase of pore pressure , and the correlation between permeability to the gas and pressure could be described by klinkenberg s formula for more experimental data .",
    "it has been shown that we need to apply pore pressure above 1mpa , if we want to avoid klinkenberg effect .",
    "tight gas and shale gas reservoir systems pose a tremendous potential resource for future development .",
    "that is why various attempts have been made to model such kind of flow behavior .",
    "skjetne and gudmundsson @xcite and skjetne and auriault @xcite theoretically investigated the wall - slip gas flow phenomenon in porous media based on the navier - stokes equation , but did not offer any correlation for the klinkenberg effect .",
    "florence et al .",
    "@xcite made an attempt to derive a general expression for gas permeability of tight porous media , using the hagen - poiseuille - type equation .",
    "civan @xcite pointed out that by rigorous application of a unified hagen - poiseuille - type equation he made some critical improvements , which allowed him to get an accurate and effective correlation of apparent gas permeability in tight porous media .",
    "freeman et al .",
    "@xcite examined the effects of knudsen diffusion on gas composition in ultra - tight rock .    in the publication @xcite",
    ", the authors provided the analysis of steady state and transient gas flow through porous media .",
    "they have derived a convenient form of a nonlinear governing equation , incorporating the klinkenberg effect . under conditions of a steady state flow",
    "the governing equation becomes linear and can be solved analytically . in the case of a transient",
    "flow the authors perform the procedure of linearization , in view to find analytical solutions .",
    "in this work we study gas flow through tight porous media .",
    "the deviation from linear correlation between the pressure gradient and velocity appears due to the fact , that permeability and viscosity are considered to be functions of pressure .",
    "nonlinear governing equation , incorporating klinkenberg effect , is solved in for a transient gas flow . as a result of our analysis ,",
    "approximate self - similar solutions have been found for the appropriate boundary - value problems .",
    "an applied method can be used for finding exact solutions of integrable equations .",
    "it can be particularly effective in finding solutions for the equations for which the cauchy problem is not solved in general case ( see , for a example , books @xcite ) .",
    "the same approach can be successfully used for modeling of the processes of a nonlinear heat transfer due to the similarity of mathematical description of the processes of gas filtration and those of heat transfer , as it is done in @xcite .",
    "under the isothermal conditions a gas flow in porous media is governed by a mass balance equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gas density , @xmath10 is the porosity , @xmath18 is the darcy s velocity of the gas phase defined as @xmath19 in the last relationship @xmath20 stands for viscosity , @xmath21 for permeability and @xmath22 for the pressure gradient ( the gravity effects are ignored ) .",
    "the correlation between the gas density and the pressure is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the molar mass of the gas , @xmath25 is the temperature and @xmath26 is the universal gas constant",
    ". the combination of these equations will give the gas flow equation in the following form @xmath27 .",
    "let us consider that we consider one dimentional case of a gaseous flow in a porous medium .",
    "it can be described by the following nonlinear partial differential equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the coordinate , @xmath30 is the time , @xmath31 is the pressure @xmath1 , @xmath32 is the permeability of the medium , @xmath33 is a coefficient . let us suppose that @xmath34 assuming that at @xmath35 we get the constant pressure @xmath36 as @xmath37 and the initial value for pressure as @xmath38 we get the boundary - value problem for eq . in @xmath39 .",
    "using the change of variables @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath25 are constants , from eq .",
    "we obtain the equation in the following form ( the primes are omitted ) @xmath43    assuming that @xmath44 we can see that eq . admits the following transformation group @xmath45    therefore , eq .",
    "is invariant under the dilatation group of transformations with the invariants in the form @xmath46    taking the invariants into account we can search for exact solutions of eq . in the form",
    "@xmath47    in this case , we have the equation for @xmath48 in the form of nonlinear ordinary differential equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 and boundary conditions appears as @xmath51 eq . does not integrable analytically .",
    "as it was already discussed in @xcite the propagation velocity of a wave front for the pressure is finite in a number of problems of nonlinear gas filtration .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the fact that there exists a coordinate of a wave front @xmath52 such that @xmath53    let us search for the approximate solution of eq . in the form @xmath54    after differentiation we obtain from eq .",
    "@xmath55    on the one hand , we get @xmath56    but , on the other hand , from eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath57    consequently , by differentiating with respect to @xmath58 , we find higher order derivatives of @xmath48 at @xmath52 and thus obtain the other values of coefficients @xmath59 : @xmath60 and so on .",
    "note , that in expressions , we have introduced the following notations @xmath61    this way we obtain an approximate solution of eq . for @xmath62 in the form @xmath63 and",
    "the value of the constant @xmath64 may be obtained from the first one of boundary conditions . by substituting the approximate solution in this condition",
    "we get ( in case of @xmath65 ) @xmath66 by solving this nonlinear equation numericallywe obtain the value of @xmath64 and according to , we obtain the approximate solution of the eq ..",
    "let us consider examples of equations with different values of @xmath67 i.e. with different cases of dependence of the permeability and viscosity on the pressure .",
    "these cases should be regarded as various possible approximations of real dependences , resulting from experiments .",
    "the corresponding parameters in the following formulas have been chosen to be fitting parameters . in these examples",
    "we are looking for approximate self - similar solutions of the problem with appropriate boundary conditions , using , , .",
    "@xmath68 our approximate self - similar solution is found by considering only five approximation coefficients ( see , ) , but our approach allows us to look for much more than that .    in order to check our approximate self - similar solutions we also used the numerical approach .",
    "we applied the finite differences , shooting method , newton s method and linear extrapolation at a small @xmath48 to obtain the numerical solution . in our calculations",
    "the step size was @xmath69 .",
    "calculating by shooting method was proceed until @xmath70 .",

    "it has turned out that this problem can be solved by taking the self - similar variables into account .",
