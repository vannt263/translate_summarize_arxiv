    "brownian motors , or ratchets , are devices which rectify fluctuations , turning in this way unbiased brownian motion into directed diffusion , in the absence of net applied bias forces .",
    "the concept of ratchet was initially introduced to point out the strict limitations on directed transport at equilibrium imposed by the second principle of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "ratchets have then been attracting growing attention in different communities for the number of applications : from particle separation , to the modelling of molecular motors , and to the realization of novel types of electron pumps , just to name a few .",
    "recent reviews ( @xcite , @xcite ) provide a detailed account of the theoretical work relevant to the ratchet effect , the experimental realizations in many different fields and related practical applications .",
    "the present article reviews recent realizations of driven ratchets for cold atoms .",
    "a previous review @xcite summarized the experimental work at that time . in these cold atom systems ,",
    "light fields create both a periodic potential for the atoms , and introduce fluctuations in the atomic dynamics .",
    "appropriate ac drivings can also be introduced .",
    "the so realized driven ratchets allowed us to experimentally demonstrate many of the characteristic features of ratchets , as for example current reversals .",
    "the precise control on the ac drivings also allowed us to investigate from an experimental point of view the relationship between symmetry and transport , which is the essential element for the understanding of the operation of a ratchet .",
    "this review article is organized as follows . in section [ sec",
    ": generalities ] the concept of ratchet is introduced , and two early proposals of ratchets discussed : the flashing and the rocking ratchets . in section [ sec : symmetries ] the important role that symmetries play in the operation of a ratchet device is discussed .",
    "the symmetry analysis , initially introduced from a general point of view , will then be specialized to a periodically and quasiperiodically driven rocking ratchet , and to a gating ratchet . in section [ sec : coldatoms ]",
    "recent experimental realizations of driven ratchets for cold atoms are reviewed .",
    "after introducing the main features of dissipative optical lattices , specific experimental realizations of driven ratchets for cold atoms are examined : a periodically and a quasiperiodically rocking ratchet , and the gating ratchet . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] possible future directions of research in cold atom ratchets are discussed .",
    "brownian motors are devices which produce a current out of unbiased fluctuations",
    ". strict limitations on the operation of a ratchet are imposed by the second principle of thermodynamics , which rules out the possibility of producing a current at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus , the effective generation of a current requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium .",
    "we will now examine how this is implemented in two specific cases of ratchet devices : the flashing and the rocking ratchets .",
    "consider a sample of brownian particles in a ( static ) asymmetric periodic potential .",
    "the second principle of thermodynamics rules out the possibility of directed motion .",
    "however , things are very different if the potential is `` flashed '' , i.e. if it is turned on and off repeatedly , either periodically or randomly @xcite .",
    "this is sufficient to set the brownian particles into directed motion , due to the mechanism illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    consider an initial situation with the potential turned on and the brownian particles localized at the bottom of a given well .",
    "then the potential is turned off , and the brownian particles will symmetrically diffuse in space . then the potential is turned on again , and the brownian particles are retrapped in both the original well and in a few neighbouring ones . however , as the potential is asymmetric the retrapping will lead to an asymmetric situation , with the number of particles trapped in the wells at the left of the original well different from the number of particles trapped in the wells at the right of the starting location .",
    "indeed it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the wells closer to the  steep wall \" of the starting well will collect more particles during the retrapping phase . in this way the center of mass of the particle cloud will move , and",
    "directed motion is thus obtained .",
    "it is important to point out why the operation of the flashing ratchet does not violate the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this is because work is done on the system while turning on the potential .",
    "thus , although fluctuations are rectified and a current is generated , this does not imply that work has been extracted out of just one heat source as some additional work was necessary to turn on the potential",
    ". therefore the second law of thermodynamics is not violated .      in",
    "the _ rocking _",
    "ratchet @xcite , particles in a periodic asymmetric potential experience also an applied ac force . the applied force , which is zero - average and time - symmetric , drives the system out of equilibrium . as a results of the symmetry - breaking anisotropy of the potential , a net current of particles",
    "can thus be generated .",
    "the same effect can be obtained for a spatially symmetric potential and a temporally asymmetric drive @xcite .",
    "a bi - harmonic force is a popular choice for a time asymmetric drive , with the time - symmetry of the drive controlled by the relative phase between harmonics @xcite . in the latter case of symmetric potential , and multi - harmonic driving",
    ", the underlying rectification mechanism can be traced back to harmonic mixing @xcite .    rocking ratchets , and more in general ac driven ratchets , are the central topic of the present review .",
    "therefore , in the following the relationship between symmetry and transport will be examined in detail for these ratchets .",
    "the operation of a ratchet requires an out - of - equilibrium set - up , and the breaking of the symmetries which would otherwise prevent directed motion .",
    "this section reviews the symmetry analysis for the specific case of ac driven ratchet , as derived by @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we consider a brownian particle in a spatially periodic potential @xmath0 of period @xmath1 . a time - dependent driving force @xmath2 , of zero mean ,",
    "is applied to the particle .",
    "the langevin equation for the particle of mass @xmath3 is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the first derivative of the function @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the position of the particle at the time @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the damping coefficient and a stationary gaussian noise respectively .",
    "following a standard procedure in the symmetry analysis of ratchet devices @xcite , we aim to determine the conditions for the langevin equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevin ] ) , to be invariant under the following symmetries @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 constants .",
    "these are the tranformations which map a trajectory @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the initial position and momentum , into one with opposite momentum .",
    "the invariance of the langevin equation under @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 then prevents directed motion .",
    "whether @xmath16 , @xmath17 are symmetries of the system depends on the specific form of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . throughout the present review ,",
    "we consider only the case of a spatially symmetric periodic potential @xmath20 , where @xmath13 is a constant .",

    "we first consider the dissipationless case , which will then be extended to include weak dissipation .    in the limit of no dissipation , it is immediate to see that if the driving is shift - symmetric then the system is invariant under the transformation @xmath16 , and current generation is forbidden . if the the driving is symmetric under time reversal , then the system is invariant under the transformation @xmath17 , and once again directed motion is forbidden .",
    "we now carry further the symmetry analysis for a specific form of driving .",
    "we consider the case of a bi - harmonic driving force : @xmath26    for @xmath27 the presence of both an even and an odd harmonic breaks the shift symmetry @xmath25 , independently of the relative value of the phase @xmath28 . on the other hand , whether the @xmath22 symmetry is broken depends on value of the phase @xmath28 : for @xmath29 , with @xmath30 integer , the symmetry @xmath31 is preserved , while for @xmath32 it is broken .",
    "therefore for @xmath33 current generation is forbidded , while for @xmath32 it is allowed .",
    "perturbative calculations @xcite show that the average current of particles is , in leading order , proportional to @xmath34 , in agreement with the above symmetry considerations .",
    "we now consider the case of weak , nonzero dissipation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we restrict our analysis to the case of a bi - harmonic driving of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : biharmonic ] ) . as already mentioned the shift - symmetry",
    "is broken as the driving consists both of even and odd harmonics .",
    "consider now the symmetry under time - reversal .",
    "for @xmath29 , with @xmath30 integer , the driving has @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "however , the system is not symmetric under the transformation @xmath17 because of dissipation .",
    "therefore the generation of a current is not prevented , despite the symmetry of the driving .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the generated current @xmath35 still shows an approximately sinusoidal dependence on the phase @xmath28 , but acquires a phase lag @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "such a phase lag corresponds to the dissipation - induced symmetry breaking .",

    "the driving is said to be symmetric if @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 appropriately chosen constants .",
    "if the driving is symmetric , in the dissipationless limit the system is invariant under the generalized symmetry @xmath50 and directed transport is forbidden .",

    "a current can be generated following a gating effect , with the lowering of the potential barriers synchronized with the motion produced by the additive force .",

    "moreover , the dissipationless limit ( @xmath56 ) is considered first , and a weak dissipation can be accounted for by an additional phase lag , as discussed previously .",

    "we summarize the basics of dissipative optical lattices and the underlying sisyphus cooling mechanism .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more comprehensive review of optical lattices .",
    "optical lattices are periodic potentials for atoms created by the interference of two or more laser fields . in near - resonant optical lattices",
    "a set of laser fields produce at once the periodic potential acting on the atoms and the cooling mechanism , named sisyphus cooling , which decreases their kinetic energy .",
    "the atoms are finally trapped at the bottom of the potential wells .",
    "we describe here the principles of these optical lattices in the case of a one - dimensional configuration and a @xmath63 atomic transition .",
    "this is the simplest configuration in which sisyphus cooling takes place .",
    "consider a transition @xmath63 ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) coupled to two laser fields with the same amplitude and the same wavelength @xmath1 , linearly polarized and counterpropagating .",
    "these laser fields are detuned below atomic resonance and have orthogonal linear polarization ( lin@xmath64lin configuration , see fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) ) : @xmath65+c.c\\ ] ] @xmath66+c.c\\ ] ] where @xmath67 are the unit vectors of linear polarization along the @xmath68 axes and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the laser field wavevector and angular frequency , respectively .",
    "the total electric field is @xmath71\\exp ( -i\\omega t)+c.c.\\ ] ] where @xmath72 are the unit vectors of circular polarization .",
    "after elimination of the relative phase @xmath73 through an appropriate choice of the origin of the space- and time - coordinates , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by :    @xmath76    [ eq_pol ] the superposition of the two laser fields @xmath77 , @xmath78 produces therefore an electric field characterized by a constant intensity and a spatial gradient of polarization ellipticity of period @xmath79 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .",
    "we examine now the effects that the laser fields have on the atoms .",
    "the basic mechanism responsible for the generation of a periodic potential is the `` light shift '' : a laser field coupling a given transition , and characterized by an intensity @xmath80 and detuning @xmath81 from atomic resonance , leads to a shift of the ground state energy ( `` light shift '' ) proportional to @xmath82 .    in the present case of a @xmath63 transition",
    "there are two laser fields coupling each ground state sublevel to the excited state , and contributions from all these couplings have to be taken into account to derive the light shifts @xmath83 for the ground state zeeman sublevels @xmath84 .",
    "we will omit here the details of the calculations , and simply report the final results for the light shifts ( see @xcite for the derivation ) : @xmath85 here @xmath86 are the intensities of the right- and left - polarization components of the light , and @xmath87 is the total intensity .",
    "the quantity @xmath88 is the _ light shift per beam _ for an optical transition with a clebsch - gordan coefficient equal to 1 : @xmath89 here @xmath81 is the detuning of the optical field from atomic resonance and @xmath90 the linewidth of the atomic transition .",
    "@xmath91 is the rabi frequency @xcite produced by an electric field of amplitude @xmath92 driving the optical transition supposing its clebsch - gordan coefficient equal to 1 .",
    "the square of the resonant rabi frequency is proportional to the light intensity , so in the limit of not too small detuning @xmath81 , we find that the light shift per beam scales as @xmath93 , as already mentioned . by substituting the expressions ( [ eq_pol ] ) for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , the light shifts @xmath83 can be rewritten as : @xmath96\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath97    the depth of the potential wells . we therefore conclude that the light ellipticity gradient produces a periodic modulation of the light shifts of the ground state zeeman sublevels ( fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ) .",
    "these periodic modulation acts as an optical potential for the atoms , and indeed these periodically modulated light shifts are usually referred to as _",
    "optical potentials_. these optical potentials can be characterized by their depth @xmath98 or by the related angular vibrational frequency at the bottom of the well @xmath99 . for a @xmath100 atom ,",
    "the relationship between these two quantities is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the recoil frequency for an atom of mass @xmath3 .",
    "we turn now to the analysis of the cooling mechanism , the so - called sisyphus cooling @xcite , which decreases the kinetic energy of the atoms and allows their trapping at the bottom of the wells of the optical potential .",
    "sisyphus cooling is determined by the combined action of the light shifts and of optical pumping , which transfers , through cycles of absorption / spontaneous emission , atoms from one ground state sublevel to the other one .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . consider an atom moving with a positive velocity , and initially at @xmath103 in the state @xmath104 .",
    "while moving in the positive @xmath105 direction the atom climbs the potential curve corresponding to its actual internal state .",
    "this has two consequences : first , a part of the kinetic energy of the atoms is transformed in potential energy ; second , the component @xmath106 of the light increases , which implies the increase of the optical pumping rate towards the level @xmath107 , i.e. an increase of the probability of transfering the atom from the actual internal state @xmath104 to the state @xmath107 . at the top of the potential hill ( @xmath108 , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) the polarization of the light is purely @xmath106 , and the probability to transfer the atom into the sublevel @xmath107 is very large .",
    "the transfer of the atom into the level @xmath107 results into a loss of potential energy , which is carried away by the spontaneously emitted photon .",
    "this process is repeated several times , until the atom does not have enough energy any more to reach the top of a potential hill , and it is trapped in a well .",
    "we notice here the analogy with the myth of sisyphus , king of corinth , condemned forever to roll a huge stone up a hill which repeatedly rolls back to the bottom before the summit is reached .",
    "this is why the described cooling mechanism has been named sisyphus cooling .",
    "the described cooling process leads to the localization of the atoms at the bottom of the potential wells , and we obtain in this way an _ optical lattice _ : an ensemble of atoms localized in a periodic potential .",
    "we notice that the atoms are localized at the sites where their interaction with the light is maximum .",
    "it is because of this property that optical lattices of this type are termed _ bright _ optical lattices .",
    "an important quantity for the investigations reviewed in this work is the damping rate of the atomic velocity ( `` cooling rate '' )",
    ". this will be the essential parameter to investigate the phenomenon of dissipation - induced symmetry breaking in a rocking ratchet for cold atoms .",
    "theoretical and experimental work @xcite showed that the cooling rate is proportional to the scattering rate @xmath109 . for our 1d configuration and a @xmath63 atom ,",
    "the scattering rate can be expressed as : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the saturation per beam .",
    "therefore the scattering rate @xmath109 will be used in the following to characterize the level of dissipation in the system under consideration .",
    "the realization of a driven ratchet requires essentially three elements .",
    "first , a periodic potential ; second , a fluctuating environment which results in friction and in a fluctuating force . finally , it should be possible to apply a zero - mean ac - force to the particles ( the atoms in the present case ) .",
    "all these requirements can be satisfied by using cold atoms in optical lattices , as it was demonstrated by @xcite . in that work the one - dimensional spatially symmetric lin@xmath64lin optical lattice described in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] was taken as periodic potential .",
    "we turn now to the analysis of the friction and fluctuations in the optical lattice , the second element necessary to use optical lattices as a model system for brownian motors .",
    "as already discussed , the optical pumping between the different atomic ground state sublevels combined with the spatial modulation of the optical potential leads to the cooling of the atoms and to their localization at the minima of the optical potential .",
    "the essential fact for the realization of brownian motors is that even after the cooling phase , characterized by a decrease of the kinetic energy of the atoms and their trapping in the optical potential , the atoms keep interacting with the light fields and this induces fluctuations in the atomic dynamics .",
    "indeed , consider an atom that has already lost enough energy to be trapped at the bottom of a potential well .",
    "the atom will then oscillate at the bottom of the well at angular frequency @xmath99 .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .    to be specific , consider for example an atom initially in the @xmath107 state .",
    "exactly at the center of the well the light polarization is purely @xmath106 , which does not allow the transfer from the @xmath107 state to the @xmath104 sublevel .",
    "however , out of the center of the well the light has also a nonzero @xmath112 component , which results in a nonzero probability to transfer the atom from its original sublevel to the other one . therefore the atom can be transfered from one sublevel to the other one , and also the potential experienced by the atom will change from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , i.e. the force experienced by the atom will change . as",
    "optical pumping is a stochastic process , the ( stochastic ) transfer from a sublevel to the other one results in a _ fluctuating force_. figure [ fig8 ] also shows how optical pumping between different optical potentials leads to the transport of atoms through the lattice : although the trapped atom does not have enough energy to climb the potential hill , optical pumping allows the transfer from a potential well to the neighbouring one .",
    "the optical pumping leads then to a _ random walk _ of the atoms through the optical potential , and indeed normal diffusion has been experimentally observed for an atomic cloud expanding in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "two different quantities , the diffusion coefficients in momentum space @xmath115 and in real space @xmath116 , can be introduced to characterize the atomic random walk in momentum and position respectively .",
    "the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath115 , as determined by the fluctuations in the dipole force , scales as @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations in the dipole force are the main heating process in sisyphus cooling .",
    "thus the momentum diffusion coefficient determines , via the einstein relation @xmath118 with @xmath8 the friction coefficient , the equilibrium temperature , which is found to be proportional to the potential depth @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath116 is instead predicted to be , for the range of lattice parameters corresponding to normal diffusion , approximately proportional to the scattering rate @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the last element necessary to implement a rocking ratchet is the oscillating force . in order to generate a time - dependent homogeneous force ,",
    "one of the lattice beams is phase modulated , so to obtain the electric field configuration : @xmath119 + \\vec{\\epsilon}_y e_0 \\exp [ i(-kz-\\omega t+\\alpha ( t ) ) ] \\right\\ } + c.c.~,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the time - dependent phase . in the laboratory reference frame this laser configuration generates a moving optical potential @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "consider now the dynamics in the moving reference frame defined by @xmath122 . in this",
    "accelerated reference frame the optical potential is stationary .",
    "in addition to the potential the atom , of mass @xmath123 , experiences also an inertial force @xmath2 in the @xmath105 direction proportional to the acceleration @xmath124 of the moving frame : @xmath125 in this way in the accelerated frame of the optical potential the atoms experience an homogeneous force which can be controlled by varying the phase @xmath120 of one of the lattice beams .      the appropriate choice of the phase @xmath126 for the realization of the spatially symmetric rocking ratchet is @xmath127 \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 constant . indeed , by using eq .",
    "( [ inertial ] ) , we can see immediately that in the accelerated frame of the optical potential the phase modulation @xmath126 will result into a force @xmath128 \\label{force}\\ ] ]    with @xmath129 the relative weight of the @xmath130 term .",
    "this force is of the form needed for the realization of the spatially symmetric rocking ratchet .",
    "experimentally , it is possible to obtain a phase modulation of the form ( [ alpha ] ) by simply using acousto - optical modulators and a set of radio - frequency generators .",
    "the exact technical realization is of no particular interest here , and we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "we only notice that it is possible experimentally to carefully control the phase difference @xmath28 between the two harmonics .",
    "this allows us to carefully control the symmetry of the system .",
    "the experiment of @xcite on @xmath131rb atoms clearly demonstrated the control of the current through a spatially symmetric potential by varying the time - symmetries of the system . in that work ,",
    "the dynamics of the atoms in the optical lattice was studied by direct imaging of the atomic cloud with a ccd camera . for a given phase @xmath28 the position of the center of mass of the atomic cloud was studied as a function of time .",
    "it should be noticed that in principle it is necessary to transform the measurements from the laboratory reference frame to the accelerated reference frame of the optical potential , by using the coordinate transformation @xmath122 .",
    "however in the case of @xcite this is not necessary as for the typical time scales of that experiment ( period of the ac force and imaging time ) the measured positions of the c.m . of the atomic cloud in the laboratory and in the accelerated reference frame",
    "are approximately equal .",
    "the results of that experiment are reported in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the center of mass of the atomic cloud moves with constant velocity ( see inset ) .",
    "this velocity shows the expected dependence on the phase @xmath28 : for @xmath29 , with @xmath30 integer , the velocity ( current of atoms ) is zero , while for @xmath132 the velocity reaches a maximum ( positive or negative ) .",
    "this because although the symmetry @xmath133 is broken for any value of the phase @xmath28 , there is a residual symmetry @xmath134 which forbids the current generation .",
    "this symmetry is controlled by the phase @xmath28 : for @xmath29 it is realized , while for @xmath135 it is maximally broken .",
    "+   + the experiment of @xcite proved that the atoms can be set into directed motion through a symmetric potential by breaking the temporal symmetry of the system . that described experiment reproduced well the dependence of the current on the phase @xmath28 derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : periodic ] on the basis of the analysis of symmetries which apply in the hamiltonian limit , i.e. in the absence of dissipation .",
    "this because @xcite performed the experiment in the regime of relatively strong driving and small damping , which well approximates the hamiltonian regime , as confirmed by detailed numerical simulations @xcite .      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : periodic ] , the presence of weak damping results in a shift of the curve representing the current as a function of the relative phase between the driving harmonics .",
    "this corresponds to a dissipation - induced symmetry breaking , with the generation of a current for a system hamiltonian symmetric in time and space .",
    "such a ratchet regime was demonstrated experimentally by @xcite .    in that experiment",

    "a bichromatic driving force along one direction was applied by phase - modulating one of the lattice beam .",
    "a rocking ratchet was realized in this way .",
    "the level of dissipation was quantitatively characterized by the photon scattering rate @xmath136 , which can be controlled experimentally by varying the lattice fields parameters .",
    "different sets of measurements were performed for different values of the scattering rate @xmath136 at a constant depth of the optical potential .",
    "this was done by varying simultanously the intensity @xmath80 and detuning @xmath81 of the lattice beams , so to keep the potential depth @xmath137 constant while varying the scattering rate @xmath138 .",
    "we notice that as @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be varied only within a finite range , dissipation can not be suppressed completely , i.e. it is not possible to obtain @xmath139 .",
    "however , as we will see , for the driving strength considered in the experiment , the smallest accessible scattering rate results in a phase shift which is zero within the experimental error , i.e. this choice of parameters well approximates the dissipationless case . by then increasing @xmath136 it was possible to investigate the effects of dissipation .",
    "the results of the measurements of @xcite , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_diss1 ] , demonstrate clearly the phenomenon of dissipation - induced symmetry - breaking . in agreement with previous theoretical work @xcite , the measured current of atoms",
    "is well approximated by @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , by fitting data as those reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_diss1 ] with the function @xmath141 the phase shift @xmath36 was determined as a function of @xmath136 , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_diss2 ] .",
    "the measured phase shift @xmath36 is zero , within the experimental error , for the smallest scattering rate examined in the experiment . in this case , no current is generated for @xmath29 , with @xmath30 integer , as for this value of the phase the system is invariant under time - reversal transformation .",
    "the magnitude of the phase shift @xmath36 increases at increasing scattering rate , and differs significantly from zero .",
    "the nonzero phase shift corresponds to current generation for @xmath29 , i.e. when the system hamiltonian is invariant under the time - reversal transformation .",
    "this result clearly demonstrates the breaking of the system symmetry by dissipation .",
    "the cold atom experiments reviewed so far aimed to investigate the relationship between symmetry and transport in rocking ratchets . in those experiments the generation of a current was studied as a function of the parameters controlling the symmetry of the system : the relative phase @xmath28 , which controls the symmetry of the driving , and the scattering rate , which controls the symmetry - breaking of the system by dissipation .",
    "however , in many other ratchet experiments , different aspects of ratchets are investigated . instead of studying the current as a function of the symmetry - breaking parameters ,",
    "a given investigation considers thoroughly a system with broken hamiltonian symmetry .",
    "this can be realized , for example , by using a rocking ratchet with a spatially asymmetric potential or a temporally asymmetric force .",
    "that study of the ratchet current amplitude as a function of the system parameters ( driving amplitude and frequency , noise strength ) reveals several distinguishing features of the ratchet effect .",
    "namely , current reversals are observed in correspondence of the variation of the driving amplitude and frequency .",
    "furtermore , a non - monotonic dependence of the amplitude of the generated current on the fluctuations level is a signature of the rectification of fluctuations associated with the ratchet process .",
    "investigations along these lines with cold atom ratchets with broken hamiltonian symmetry led to the observation of several hallmarks of the ratchet effects . in the experiments by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a spatially symmetric rocking ratchet with bi - harmonic driving was considered . throughout those investigations ,",
    "the relative phase between the harmonics of the driving was fixed to @xmath142 , so that the hamiltonian time - symmetry of the system was broken .",
    "in @xcite the current of atoms through the lattice was studied as a function of the strength of the applied ac force for different values of the optical pumping rate @xmath109 .",
    "results of those measurements , reported in fig .  [ fig : jones1 ] , show a clear dependence of the atomic current on the amplitude of the applied force and on the optical pumping rate .",
    "consider first the dependence on the ac force magnitude .",
    "for a small amplitude of the ac force the average atomic velocity is an increasing function of the force amplitude , with the atoms moving in the positive direction . at larger amplitude of the ac force",
    "the velocity decreases , and a current reversal is observed , with the atomic cloud moving in the negative direction .",
    "this kind of behaviour , named _",
    "current reversal _",
    ", is a hallmark of rocking ratchets .",
    "we examine now the dependence of the current on the optical pumping rate , i.e. on the noise level .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : jones1 ] that such a dependence is very different depending on the ac force amplitude . for large amplitude of the applied force the magnitude of the current ( in absolute value ) is a decreasing function of the optical pumping rate .",
    "this means that in this regime the motion can be attributed to deterministic forces and correspond to force rectification by harmonic mixing : in a nonlinear medium the two harmonics , of frequency @xmath143 and @xmath144 and phase difference @xmath28 , are mixed and the rectified force produces a current @xmath145 . in the considered experiment",
    "the nonlinearity of the medium is the anharmonicity of the optical potential . in this regime of rectification of the forces",
    "the noise does not play any constructive role in the generation of the current of atoms . on the contrary",
    ", the noise disturbs the process of rectification of the forces , and indeed the current decreases for increasing optical pumping rate .",
    "thus , this regime does not correspond to the rectification of fluctuations .",
    "a very different dependence of the current amplitude on the optical pumping rate was found in the regime of small amplitudes of the applied force .",
    "indeed in this regime the current is for small pumping rates an increasing function of the pumping rate , and the current vanishes in the limit of vanishing optical pumping rates . at larger pumping rates the current reaches a maximum and",
    "then decreases again .",
    "this bell - shaped dependence of the current on the optical pumping rate is a typical signature of a brownian motor : in the absence of fluctuations the current is zero , then increases until the fluctuations are so large that the presence of the potential and of the applied fields become irrelevant , and the current decreases again .",
    "thus , in the regime of small ac force amplitude the optical lattice provides an implementation of a brownian motor .",
    "another important parameter for the rectification mechanism is the driving frequency .",
    "consider first the problem of the escape of a brownian particle from a _ single _ potential well .",
    "it is well known that in the presence of nonadiabatic driving the lifetime of the particle in the well can be significantly reduced , a phenomenon named _ resonant activation _ @xcite .",
    "resonant activation has also been theoretically studied for brownian particles in periodic potentials .",
    "also in this case the nonadiabatic driving may result in a significant enhancement of the activation rate .",
    "moreover , whenever the spatio - temporal symmetry of the system is broken , the resonant activation gives then rise to _ resonant",
    "_ rectification of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the resonant activation results in a resonance as function of the driving frequency in the current of atoms through the periodic potential .",
    "the theoretical work @xcite also predicted that by changing the frequency of the driving it is possible to control the direction of the diffusion .",
    "the experimental work by @xcite precisely studied the driving frequency dependence of the rectification mechanism in a periodically driven rocking ratchet for cold atoms . in that work ,",
    "the current of atoms through the ac driven lattice was studied as a function of the driving frequency @xmath143 , for a given relative phase @xmath142 between the driving harmonics , so to break the time - symmetry of the system .",
    "the build - up of a resonance was observed when the amplitude of the driving was progressively increased , as shown in fig  [ fig_act ] .",
    "the resonance appears in the regime of non - adiabatic driving ( @xmath146 ) , and a current reversal is observed on the low - frequency side of the resonance , in agreement with the general theory @xcite .",
    "experiments by @xcite investigated the transition from periodic to quasiperiodic driving , and examined how the symmetry analysis is modified in this transition . in these experiments ,",
    "a multifrequency driving was used , as obtained by combining signals at three different frequencies : @xmath38 , @xmath147 and @xmath39 . for @xmath40 irrational",
    "the driving is quasiperiodic .",
    "clearly , in a real experiment @xmath40 is always a rational number , which can be written as @xmath57 , with @xmath148 two coprime positive integers .",
    "however , as the duration of the experiment is finite , by choosing @xmath149 and @xmath59 sufficiently large it is possible to obtain a driving which is effectively quasiperiodic on the time scale of the experiment .",
    "different forms of multifrequency driving were examined in the experimental realizations , each probing a different symmetry .",
    "the first form of driving examined by @xcite consisted of the sum of three harmonics :    @xmath150    in the analysis , the effects of dissipation can be neglected , as we know that it results in an additional phase shift .",
    "consider first the case of periodic driving , with @xmath40 rational .",
    "for biharmonic driving , i.e. @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : triharmonic ] ) , the shift symmetry is broken for any value of @xmath28 , while the time - reversal symmetry is preserved for @xmath29 , with @xmath30 integer .",
    "a current of the form @xmath152 is obtained as a result .",
    "consider now the effect of the third harmonic , i.e. @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : triharmonic ] . for a phase @xmath154 of the @xmath39 harmonic , this additional driving is invariant under time reversal , and",
    "therefore the total driving is still invariant under time - reversal for @xmath29 . instead , for @xmath155 the symmetry under time - reversal",
    "is broken and directed transport is allowed also for @xmath29 . in other words , for @xmath156 the third driving leads to an additional phase shift of the current as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the magnitude of such a shift depends on the phase @xmath157 .",
    "taking dissipation also into account , it follows that the current will show the dependence @xmath37 where @xmath36 includes the phase shift produced by dissipation and the phase shift produced by the harmonic at frequency @xmath39 .",
    "we now turn to the case of a quasiperiodic driving , as obtained in the case of irrational @xmath40 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasi ] the symmetry analysis for the periodic driving can be generalized to the quasiperiodic case by treating the phases @xmath158 and @xmath159 as independent variables .",
    "we notice that the driving considered here , eq .",
    "( [ eq : triharmonic ] ) , is invariant under the transformation @xmath160 for any @xmath157 , as @xmath157 can be reabsorbed in @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the invariance under the transformation @xmath161 is entirely determined by the invariance of @xmath2 under the transformation @xmath162 ; i.e. , we recover the results for biharmonic driving : @xmath161 is a symmetry , and therefore directed motion is forbidden , for @xmath29 .",
    "hence , in the quasiperiodic limit , the third harmonic at frequency @xmath39 is not relevant for the symmetry of the system , which is entirely determined by the biharmonic term at frequency @xmath38 , @xmath147 .    in the experiment by @xcite , the transition to quasiperiodicity",
