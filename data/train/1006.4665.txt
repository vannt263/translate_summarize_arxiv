    "neutron stars are found in a large variety of astrophysical settings , such as in accreting binaries , degenerate binaries , supernova remnants , and as isolated objects .",
    "they are one possible endpoint to the evolution of massive stars as well as being the locations of the highest magnetic field strengths and highest densities in the universe .",
    "they are often found through their radio , x - ray , or gamma - ray pulsations , which can be on time scales as short as milliseconds , and they can be accretion- or rotation - powered @xcite . despite attempts to determine their fundamental properties using numerous techniques ,",
    "the form of matter that exists within a neutron star is still a mystery .",
    "the work that has been done to try to determine the neutron star composition has strong contributions from both theory and observation . for an assumed neutron star ( ns )",
    "composition , the theoretical pressure - density relationship ( i.e. , equation of state , eos ) directly predicts a specific ns mass - radius relationship @xcite , so that measurements of mass and/or radius provide direct constraints on the ns eos .",
    "it is currently even unknown whether nss might be made of quark matter , which gives a radically different mass - radius relationship from normal matter @xcite .",
    "most notably , each theoretical eos has a maximum ns mass that can be supported @xcite , so that one measurement of an over - massive ns ( @xmath02  rather than the more canonical 1.4 ) would severely constrain the possibilities for the ns eos .",
    "although accurate ns mass measurements have been made for nss in binary systems , the very accurate measurements have found values close to 1.4  @xcite .",
    "however , more recent observations have shown evidence for over - massive nss with best estimates in the 1.82.8  range .",
    "these have come both from high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations of binary radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is evidence from studies of `` type i '' x - ray bursts , which are caused by thermonuclear flashes on the ns surface @xcite , that the maximum ns mass is in the 1.92.3  range @xcite .",
    "improving the mass constraints and enlarging the sample of nss with accurate mass measurements could finally lead to definitively ruling out eoss .",
    "currently , the hmxbs with the best ns mass estimates use x - ray pulsations to measure the projected size of the ns orbit and optical spectroscopy to measure the radial velocities of the companion star and , thus , to constrain the projected size of the companion s orbit @xcite .",
    "however , even in cases where these measurements are possible , the binary inclination is still a major source of uncertainty in the measurement of the ns mass .",
    "thus , in this work , we explore how ns mass measurements can be improved via optical astrometry . in many cases ,",
    "hmxb orbits are as large as 20 to several hundred @xmath2as , and the companion s orbit , including the binary inclination , can be mapped directly with astrometry on the microarcsecond level @xcite . here",
    ", we look at the specific case of the future _ space interferometry mission _ and perform detailed simulations to determine how well this mission would be able to constrain ns masses .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         while detection of orbital motion may still be possible for several of the other hmxbs close to the sensitivity line in figure  [ fig : signature ] , such a detection is not feasible in the extreme cases . for a source as faint as exo  2030 + 375 ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "even if one increases the science target integration time per chop to 2 hours ( the maximum allowed by the dape tool ) , the sma is 10  @xmath2as , which is larger than the 7  @xmath2as size of the orbit ( see table  [ tab : signature ] ) . although one could conceivably still detect the orbit with a large number of visits , even as few as 20 visits would require nearly 1 month of mission time",
    "thus , detecting the orbit would likely take several months and would clearly not be a good use of _ sim lite _ time .      for each of the six hmxbs , we simulated 2,000 _",
    "sim lite _ observing campaigns and fitted the data with the 11 parameter model described above ( note that there are 11 rather than 12 free parameters because we always fixed the orbital period to the known value ) .",
    "for each hmxb and each parameter , we produced histograms of the 2,000 best fit values obtained .",
    "for all of the parameters of all of the hmxbs except for v830  cen , the histograms appear to be normally distributed , allowing us to fit each histogram with a gaussian and use the @xmath1 value to estimate the uncertainties on each parameter that _",
    "sim lite _ will be able to obtain . for v830  cen ,",
    "the histogram for the eccentricity parameter is not normally distributed .",
    "we suspect that the parameter is not well - constrained because v830  cen has the smallest estimated semi - major axis , @xmath4  @xmath2as , and we discuss the case of v830  cen further below .",
    "we report the simulation results for the other five hmxbs in table  [ tab : results1 ] , including the six orbital parameters as well as the parallax measurement . _",
    "sim lite _ will greatly improve constraints on the binary inclinations , @xmath5 .",
    "while the current uncertainties are on the order of @xmath010@xmath6 , with a large systematic component , _ sim lite _ will constrain @xmath5 to within @xmath70.28@xmath6 , @xmath70.98@xmath6 , @xmath71.58@xmath6 , and @xmath72.50@xmath6 for x  per , v725  tau , vela  x-1 , and gx  3012 , respectively . also , _ sim lite _ will provide the first direct measurements of the angular size of the companion s semi - major axis , @xmath8 .",
    "for example , for x  per and vela  x-1 , our simulations indicate measurements of @xmath9  @xmath2as and @xmath10  @xmath2as .    for each hmxb ,",
    "table  [ tab : results1 ] provides a measurement of the parallax , @xmath11 , and then an actual measurement of the distance .",
    "the uncertainty shown with @xmath11 is that obtained from the fit to the data .",
    "however , there is also an uncertainty from the fact that the reference frame will only be known to within 4  @xmath2as , and both error components are given with the distance measurement .",
    "if x  per is at a distance of 1000  pc , we predict that _ sim lite _ will measure its distance to an accuracy of @xmath05  pc .",

    "the contribution from each parameter ( @xmath44 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath45 ) to the uncertainty on @xmath56 is given in tables  [ tab : results1 ] and [ tab : results2 ] .",
    "for v725  tau , the largest contribution to the uncertainty comes from the @xmath45 term , so that the future measurement of @xmath56 can be substantially improved with x - ray observations of this system .",
    "the results of these simulations show that _ sim lite _ will provide excellent constraints on the masses of neutron stars in hmxbs .",
    "there is currently no direct method for obtaining the binary inclinations ( @xmath5 ) of hmxbs , and this will be a major improvement in the measurements .",
    "this is especially true for non - eclipsing systems like x  per and v725  tau , for which @xmath5 is thought to be near @xmath89 , but it is currently only estimated to about @xmath71015@xmath6 .",
    "with such a large uncertainty in @xmath5 , we do not have any current estimate of the ns masses in these systems , which is why we assume 1.4  for the simulations .",
    "since these are both accreting systems , there is a strong possibility that the ns masses are significantly higher , which could allow for a constraint on the ns eos .",
    "the current constraints on @xmath5 are better for vela  x-1 , which is an eclipsing system , but hmxbs with relatively short orbital periods can be eclipsing for a wide range of inclinations ; thus , the improvement in the measurement of @xmath5 that _ sim lite _ will provide is important .",
    "there are already suggestions that the vela  x-1 ns is over - massive , and if _ sim lite _ finds that the ns mass is , e.g. , @xmath59  , as found with our simulations , this would rule out many ns eoss @xcite .",
    "there are also possibilities for further improvements to the accuracy of the ns mass measurements estimated in tables  [ tab : results1 ] and [ tab : results2 ] .",
    "we assume in our simulations that we will use _ sim lite _ to determine the times of periastron ( @xmath29 ) , but if contemporaneous x - ray observations can be made , it will be possible to accurately determine this time using the x - ray pulsations . also , we find that , after _ sim lite _ measurements of v725  tau , the uncertainty in @xmath56 will be dominated by the measurement of @xmath45 ; thus , x - ray measurements to improve the measurement of this parameter could ultimately lead to a mass constraint that is nearly as good as that for x  per . finally , one more piece of information that we have not considered in this work is the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the companion star ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this parameter is related to the projected size of the orbit , and a cross - check between this parameter and the astrometric parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath44 , @xmath5 , and @xmath12 ) will be possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although we focus on obtaining ns masses via orbital measurements in this work , it should also be pointed out that _ sim lite _ can also contribute to constraining eoss by improving measurements of ns radii .",
    "two techniques for measuring the radii of nss in low - mass x - ray binaries use measurements of the x - ray emission from the neutron star surface : one is to observe the thermal x - rays from the surface of a ns when the accretion rate is very low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and another is to measure the thermal emission near the end of a type i x - ray burst @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the distance to the lmxb is the largest uncertainty in the ns radius measurement ( see the references above and * ? ? ? * ) , and _",
    "sim lite _ will provide accurate distances for a large number of lmxbs .    finally , it is important to note that our requirement in this work that @xmath45 be a measured parameter eliminates many interesting hmxbs that will be excellent targets for _ sim lite_. in @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath020 hmxbs for which the predicted astrometric signatures will be large enough for orbital measurements .",
    "this includes well - known sources such as the black hole system cyg  x-1 @xcite and the likely black hole system ss  433 @xcite as well as systems where it is not clear whether the compact object is a black hole or a ns .",
    "these include the interesting case of 4u  1700377 , which is thought to be a ns based on its x - ray properties , but which has a compact object mass estimated at 2.4 .",
    "also , precise compact object masses have not been determined for the gamma - ray binaries ls  i+61@xmath6  303 and ls  5039 @xcite , but given that there are only a small number of high - mass binaries known to produce gamma - ray emission , determining the type of compact object in these systems is of great interest .",
