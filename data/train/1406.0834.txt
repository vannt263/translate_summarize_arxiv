    "stable configurations of planets in the 1:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) comprise three different cases : ( i ) tadpole orbits , which are similar to the motion of trojan asteroids near jupiter s l4 and l5 stationary points , ( ii ) horseshoe orbits , which are similar to the motion of saturn s satellites janus and epimetheus , and ( iii ) binary - planet orbits , in which case the two planets revolve about a common center - of - mass moving about the star on a keplerian orbit .",
    "numerous studies explored these configurations with different aims and goals .",
    "some mapped stability zones in orbital and parametric spaces .",
    "other studies dealt with formation and/or capture of planets in the 1:1 mmr and their survivability during planetary migration .",
    "still other works explored observational traits such as the radial velocity ( rv ) signal in stellar spectrum or transit timing variations ( ttvs ) in the case that one or both planets transit the stellar disk . while we still do not know details of dominant formation and evolutionary processes of planetary systems , as well their variety",
    ", a general consensus is that planets in 1:1 mmr should exist .",
    "here we briefly recall several important studies directly related to our work .",
    "laughlin & chambers ( 2002 ) , while studying methods that would reveal a pair of planets in 1:1 mmr from the rv analysis ( see also giuppone et  al .",
    "2012 ) , pointed out two possible formation scenarios : ( i ) planet - planet scattering that would launch one of the planets into a coorbital zone of another planet ( including possibly one of the high - eccentricity stable orbital configurations ) , and ( ii ) in - situ formation of a smaller planet near the l4 or l5 points of a jupiter - class planet .",
    "these authors also noted that the 1:1 mmr would persist during subsequent migration , since the balance between angular momentum and energy loses prevents an eccentricity increase .",
    "this behavior stands in contrast with planets captured in other ( higher - order ) resonances .",
    "moreover , if significant gas drag is present , the libration amplitude may be damped , thus stabilizing the coorbital configuration .    the suggested scenario of in - situ formation by laughlin & chambers ( 2002 ) has been modeled by several groups .",
    "beaug et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) started with a population of sub - lunar mass planetesimals already assumed to be present in the tadpole region of a giant planet , and studied conditions of coorbiting planet growth .",
    "they took into account mutual gravitation interaction of the planetesimals as well as several gas - density models . with this set - up , beaug et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) noted that only @xmath0 earth mass planets grow in their simulations .",
    "beaug et  al .",
    "also conducted simulations of planet growth during the migration phase and found essentially the same results .",
    "notably , the trojan planet orbit has not been destabilized and safely survived migration with a low final eccentricity .    a more detailed study has been presented by lyra et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) . using a sophisticated model of gas and solid dynamics in a self - gravitating thin disk",
    ", these authors modeled planet formation starting with centimeter - size pebbles .",
    "they showed that pressure maxima associated with macroscopic vortexes may collect enough particles to generate instability followed by gravitational collapse .",
    "up to @xmath1 earth mass planets may form this way in the tadpole region of a jupiter - mass primary , depending on size distribution of the pebble population .",
    "another pathway toward the formation of low - eccentricity planets in the 1:1 mmr has been studied by cresswell & nelson ( 2006 ) .",
    "these authors analysed the orbital evolution of a compact system of numerous earth- to super - earth - mass planets during the dynamical instability phase .",
    "if the planetary orbits were initially several hill radii apart in their simulations , the coorbital configuration emerged as a fairly typical case for some of the surviving planets .",
    "a similar set - up , though with different assumptions about the gas - disk density profile , has also been studied by giuppone et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who showed that even similar - mass planets may form in the 1:1 mmr configuration .",
    "additionally , these authors also simulated the coorbital - planet formation and stability during the gas - driven migration .",
    "common to these works was that the 1:1 mmr configuration formed in a sufficiently low - eccentricity state , assisted by efficient gas friction , prior or during the migration stage .",
    "if , on the other hand , most of close - in planets formed as a result of tidal evolution from a high - eccentricity state , acquired during the planet - planet scattering ( e.g. , beaug & nesvorn 2012 ) , and the gas drag was of no help to keep the eccentricities low at any stage of evolution , the fraction of surviving 1:1 mmr configurations may be very small .",
    "orbital evolution and survival of planets in the 1:1 mmr during migration has also been studied in some detail .",
    "for instance , cresswell & nelson ( 2009 ) considered dynamics of coorbiting planets during and after the gas - disk dispersal and generally found the system to be stable . in some cases ,",
    "the late migration stage with low - gas friction , or after nebula dispersal , has resulted in an increase of the libration amplitude of the tadpole regime and transition into a horseshoe regime , or even destabilization ( see also analysis in fleming & hamilton 2000 ) .",
    "rodrguez et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) included also tidal interaction with the star and found that equal - mass planets may suffer destabilization during their inward migration .",
    "unequal - mass configurations on the other hand that naturally form in the in - situ scenario , may thus be more common .    as far as the detection methods are concerned",
    ", the easiest idea would be to seek photometric dips about 1/6 for the hot - jupiter orbital period away from its transit ( as expected for a planet located in the lagrangian stationary points l4 or l5 ) .",
    "however , this approach did not yield so far a positive result ( e.g. , rowe et  al .",
    "2006 , moldovan et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "for that reason researchers sought other detection strategies .",
    "for instance , ford & gaudi ( 2006 ) found that a trojan companion to hot jupiter might be revealed by detecting an offset between the mid - time of its transit and the zero point of the radial velocity of the star ( assuming that barycenter motion is subtracted ) .",
    "this effect would be detectable with available technology for planet companions with at least several earth masses . while interesting , this method requires a combination of high - quality ttv and rv observations .",
    "so far , only upper limits of putative trojan companions were obtained with this method .    a method based uniquely on analysis of the ttvs of hot jupiter ,",
    "if accompanied by a trojan planet , was discussed by ford & holman ( 2007 ) . while finding the ttv amplitude large enough for even low - mass trojan companions , ford & holman ( 2007 ) also pointed out difficulties in interpretation of the data .",
    "for instance a trojan planet on a small - amplitude tadpole orbit would produce nearly sinusoidal ttvs in the orbit of giant planet .",
    "such signal may be produced by a distant moon and/or resonant perturbations due to additional planets in the system .",
    "it would take further tests and considerations to prove the signal is indeed due to a trojan companion .",
    "haghighipour et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) presented so far the most detailed study of ttvs produced by a trojan companion of transiting hot jupiter .",
    "their main goal was to demonstrate that the expected ttv amplitudes were within the detectable range of kepler ( or even ground - based ) observations .",
    "with that goal , they first numerically determined the stable region in the orbital phase space .",
    "next , they modeled the ttvs in the hot jupiter orbit , giving several examples of how the amplitude depends on key parameters of interest ( mass of the trojan companion and eccentricity of its orbit , orbital period of hot jupiter , etc . ) .",
    "while confirming a confidence of detectability of the produced ttvs , this work did not give any specific hints about inversion problem from ttvs to the system s parameters neither it discussed uniqueness of the ttv - based determination of trojan - planet properties .    in this work ,",
    "we approach the problem with different tools .",
    "namely , we develop a semi - analytic perturbative method suitable for low - eccentricity orbits in the 1:1 mmr .",
    "while our method can be applied to the tadpole regime , or even the binary planet configuration , we discuss the case of a coorbital planets on horseshoe orbits .",
    "this is because in this case the ttv series have a characteristic shape , which would allow us to most easily identify the orbital configuration ( see also ford & holman 2007 ) .",
    "while the final ttv inversion problem needs to be performed numerically , multi - dimensionality of the parameter space is often a problem .",
    "our formulation allows us to set approximate constraints on several key parameters such as the planetary masses and amplitude of the horseshoe orbit .",
    "this information can be used to narrow the volume of parameter space that needs to be searched .",
    "analytic understanding of ttvs is also useful to make sure that a numerical solution is physically meaningful .",
    "following robutel & pousse ( 2013 ) , we use the poincar relative variables @xmath2 to describe motion of the star with mass @xmath3 and two planets with masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is understood that @xmath6 .",
    "the stellar coordinate @xmath7 is given by its position with respect to the barycenter of the whole system , and the conjugated momentum @xmath8 is the total ( conserved ) linear momentum of the system .",
    "conveniently , @xmath8 is set to be zero in the barycentric inertial system .",
    "the coordinates @xmath9 of planets are given by their relative position with respect to the star , and the conjugated momenta @xmath10 are equal to corresponding linear momenta in the barycentric frame .",
    "the advantage of the poincar variables stems from their canonicity ( e.g. , laskar & robutel 1995 , godziewski et  al .",
    "their slight caveat is that the coordinates and momenta are given in different reference systems , which can produce non - intuitive effects ( see , e.g. , robutel & pousse 2013 ) .",
    "these are , however , of no concern in our work .    heading toward the perturbation description ,",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath11 of the system is divided into the unperturbed keplerian part @xmath12 and the perturbation @xmath13 here we denoted @xmath14 and the reduced masses @xmath15 for the planets @xmath16 .",
    "the gravitational constant is denoted by @xmath17 .    for sake of simplicity",
    ", we restrict the analysis to the planar configuration .",
    "the reference plane of the coordinate system is then chosen to coincide with the orbital plane of the two planets around the star . as a result",
    ", the planetary orbits are described by only four orbital elements : semimajor axis @xmath18 , eccentricity @xmath19 , longitude of pericenter @xmath20 and mean longitude in orbit @xmath21 . to preserve canonicity of the orbital parameters , and to deal with orbits of small eccentricity",
    ", we adopt poincar rectangular variables @xmath22 , instead of the simple keplerian set , to describe orbits of both planets ( @xmath23 and over - bar meaning complex conjugate operation ) . here the momentum conjugated to the longitude of orbit @xmath21 is the delaunay variable @xmath24 .",
    "the complex coordinate @xmath25 has its counterpart in the momentum @xmath26 , both fully describing eccentricity and pericenter longitude . in a very small eccentricity regime",
    "we may also use a non - canonical , but simpler , variable @xmath27 .    since the difference in mean longitudes of the two planets becomes the natural parameter characterizing coorbital motion , it is useful to replace variables @xmath28 by @xmath29 the advantage is that @xmath30 remains a set of canonical variables and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , are the primary parameters describing the coorbital motion .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath11 , expressed in ( [ ham1 ] ) and ( [ ham2 ] ) as a function of poincar relative variables , can be transformed with a lot of algebraic labor into a form depending on modified poincar rectangular variables @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , laskar & robutel 1995 ; robutel & pousse 2013 ) . in general , @xmath34 ,",
    "where @xmath35 with positive exponents such that @xmath36 .",
    "hence , @xmath37 are of progressively higher orders in the eccentricities of the two planets .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the lowest order .",
    "the elegance of the coorbital motion description for small eccentricities is due to a simple , though rich , form of the fundamental hamiltonian @xmath38 . while we shall return to the role of @xmath39 and higher - order terms in sec .",
    "2.2 , we first discuss the @xmath38 term .",
    "note that @xmath38 contains both the keplerian term @xmath40 and the fundamental part of the planetary interaction in @xmath41 .",
    "we find that @xmath42\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dependence on the orbital semimajor axes @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the planets only serves to keep this expression short ; the hamiltonian is truly a function of the momenta @xmath45 via @xmath46 additionally , we have @xmath47 which is not to be developed in taylor series for description of the coorbital motion at this stage",
    ". we also note that a factor @xmath48 has been omitted in the first term of the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ ham3 ] ) .",
    "this is a fairly good approximation for planetary masses much smaller than the stellar mass .",
    "we observe that the coordinate @xmath49 is absent in @xmath38 , implying that the conjugated momentum @xmath50 is constant .",
    "the @xmath50 conservation is just a simpler form of a general angular momentum integral @xmath51 at this level of approximation ( eccentricities neglected ) .",
    "the motion is thus reduced to a single degree of freedom problem @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is constant .",
    "the @xmath53 isolines in the @xmath54 space provide a qualitative information of system s dynamics .",
    "further development is driven by observation that in the coorbital regime @xmath43 and @xmath44 are both very close to some average value @xmath55 . as discussed by robutel & pousse ( 2013 )",
    ", @xmath55 may conveniently replace the constant @xmath50 momentum using @xmath56 in the same time , it is advantageous to introduce a small quantity , which will characterize small deviation of @xmath43 and @xmath44 from @xmath55",
    ". this is accomplished by replacing @xmath54 with @xmath57 using a simple shift in momentum : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "so now @xmath60 . finally , it is useful to define a dimensionless and small parameter @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 by @xmath63 even at expense , that @xmath61 is not canonically conjugated to @xmath64 . the dynamical evolution of the system is then described by quasi - hamiltonian equations @xmath65 with @xmath66 . at this moment it is also useful to relate @xmath67 to the semimajor axes of the two planets via @xmath68 and @xmath38 still given by eq .",
    "( [ ham3 ] ) .",
    "these relations permit to compute differentiation with respect to @xmath61 using the chain rule , such as @xmath69    once the solution the planet motion in new variables @xmath70 and @xmath71 is obtained , we shall also need to know mean longitudes , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , to determine ttvs . to that end we invert eqs .",
    "( [ cv1 ] ) and ( [ cv2 ] ) , obtaining @xmath74 and find @xmath75 from the integration of @xmath76 differentiation with respect to @xmath50 is obtained by the chain rule with eqs .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ a21 ] ) .",
    "it is also useful to recall that @xmath64 evolves more slowly than @xmath49 , since to the lowest order in @xmath61 : @xmath77 , while @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , the unperturbed solution reads @xmath79 , with @xmath80 implying @xmath81 to the lowest order .",
    "note that so far we considered the exact solution of @xmath38 , without referring to approximations given by its expansion in small quantities : @xmath61 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the reason for this was twofold .",
    "first , we found such series may converge slowly and truncations could degrade accuracy of the solution .",
    "second , although we find it useful to discuss some aspects of such development in the small parameters below , we note that the system is not integrable analytically at any meaningful approximation .",
    "this implies that semi - numerical approach is anyway inevitable .",
    "considering the complete system , as opposed to approximations given by truncation of series in the above mentioned small parameters , does not extent the cpu requirements importantly .",
    "in fact , eqs .",
    "( [ ham5 ] ) and ( [ ham6 ] ) are easily integrated by numerical methods ( in our examples below we used simple burlish - stoer integrator leaving implementation of more efficient symplectic methods for future work ) .    while numerical approach provides an exact solution , it is still useful to discuss some qualitative aspects by using the approximated forms of @xmath38 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath61 permits denominator factors such as @xmath84 in eq .",

    "( 27 ) and ( 28 ) in robutel & pousse 2013 ) .",
    "] this results in @xmath96 introduced already by yoder et  al .",

    "unfortunately , the hamiltonian ( [ ham7 ] ) is not integrable analytically .",
    "still , the energy conservation @xmath99 provides a qualitative insight into trajectories in @xmath100 space and also allows us to quantitatively estimate some important parameters . figure  [ f1 ] shows examples of two trajectories in phase space of @xmath100 , one corresponding to a horseshoe solution ( h ) and one corresponding to a tadpole solution ( t ) librating about the l4 lagrangian stationary solution . here , we set @xmath3 equal to solar mass , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "since we are primarily focusing on the horseshoe coorbital regime , we determine relations between parameters characterizing the h - trajectory in fig .",
    "these are the : ( i ) minimum @xmath103 and maximum @xmath104 amplitudes of @xmath105 along the trajectory , ( ii ) minimum separation angle @xmath106 , and ( iii ) half - period @xmath107 of motion along the trajectory in the @xmath100 space .",

    "equation ( [ thu1 ] ) then provides a formula for a maximum value of @xmath106 separation in the horseshoe regime , roughly @xmath118 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath106 is approximately set by lagrangian @xmath119 and @xmath120 stationary points of the @xmath38 hamiltonian .",

    "the orbits periodically switch their positions with respect to the star causing their semimajor axis to jump around the @xmath55 value .",
    "each orbit stays at higher / lower-@xmath18 regime for time @xmath107 , which is approximately @xmath136 longer than its orbital period .",
    "the switch in semimajor axes is reflected in the corresponding variations in longitude rate .",
    "note that the average @xmath21-rates for both orbits are not equal to @xmath127 from ( [ n0 ] ) , producing an offset shown by the difference of the dashed line and zero at the bottom panels of fig .",
    "this is because of the planetary masses also contributing to their mean motion about the star , while the definition of @xmath127 as a nominal , reference fast frequency did not take this into account .",
    "in fact , we find that the longitude rate normalized by @xmath127 and averaged over the coorbital cycle @xmath137 is approximately @xmath138 for each of the orbits @xmath139 , with @xmath140 being a characteristic value of the @xmath61-parameter over one of the half - cycles ( e.g. , one could approximate @xmath141 ) . when the planetary masses are unequal , as in our example , the more massive planet has the mean longitude rate primarily modified by its own mass . in our case @xmath142 .",
    "the lighter planet s longitude rate is dominated by the second term , i.e. , in our case @xmath143 .",
    "even more important for the ttv analysis is to consider how much the mean rates in longitude change during the coorbital cycle .",
    "we find that the change in longitude rates during the low / high-@xmath18 states for each of the planets is approximated by @xmath144 @xmath139 .",
    "if large enough , this value may build over a timescale @xmath107 to produce large variations in the mean longitude of planets , and thus result in large ttvs .",
    "we will discuss this in sec .",
    "so far , we approximated the interaction hamiltonian @xmath11 with the leading part @xmath38 from eq .",

    "this is an effective change in orbital longitude given here to the first order in eccentricity ( see nesvorn 2009 for higher order terms ) , which together with the direct effect in @xmath21 contributes to ttvs .",
    "it is not known a priori which of these contributions should be more important .",
    "for instance , in the case of closely packed ( but not coorbiting ) orbits studied by nesvorn & vokrouhlick ( 2014 ) , the eccentricity term ( [ lameff ] ) was generally larger than the direct perturbation in @xmath21 over a short - term timescale .",
    "we should also note that the @xmath39 and @xmath155 hamiltonians would also contribute to variations of the @xmath156 variables .",
    "perhaps the most interesting effect should be a slight modification of the planetary mean motion through the change in @xmath75 .",
    "however , since it is not our intention to develop a complete perturbation theory for coorbital motion here , we neglect these terms focusing on the lowest - order eccentricity effects .",
    "we verified that a slight change in initial conditions , specifically the @xmath61 parameter value , would equivalently represent the eccentricity modification of the @xmath75 angle .",
    "we start with the first - order eccentricity terms in @xmath39 . while apparently of a larger magnitude in @xmath11 than @xmath155 , they are short - periodic and this diminishes their importance .",
    "an easy algebra shows that the perturbation equations read ( recall that the overbar means complex conjugation ) @xmath157 with @xmath158 we neglected terms of the order @xmath61 and higher in the right hand sides of ( [ zper1 ] ) and ( [ zper2 ] ) , and used @xmath159 . since @xmath160 , the power - spectrum of the right hand sides in ( [ zper1 ] ) and ( [ zper2 ] ) is indeed dominated by the high ( orbital ) frequency @xmath127 , modulated by slower terms from @xmath161 dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "the second - order eccentricity terms in @xmath155 are important , because they are the first in the higher - order @xmath11 expansion part to depend on low - frequencies only . restricting to this part of @xmath155 , thus dropping the high - frequency component in @xmath155 , we obtain",

    "the integration timespan was @xmath175  yr covering two cycles of the coorbital motion ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "for sake of definiteness , we assumed an observer along the x - axis of the coordinate system and we numerically recorded times of transit of the two planets .",
    "the transit timing variations were obtained by removing linear ephemeris from transits .",
    "next , we assumed the system is described by a set of parameters @xmath176 introduced and discussed in sec .  2 , and numerically integrated their dynamical equations ( [ ham5 ] ) , ( [ ham6 ] ) , and ( 33 - 39 ) . for each of the planets we then computed ttvs from ( e.g. , nesvorn & morbidelli 2008 , nesvorn & vokrouhlick 2014 ) @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the effective mean motion of the unperturbed motion .",
    "we use the mean values of the longitude in orbit rate discussed in sec .",

    "having @xmath71 and @xmath75 integrated , we recover the time - dependence of the longitudes @xmath180 and @xmath181 from ( [ lam1 ] ) and ( [ lam2 ] ) . from these numerically - determined functions we subtracted the average mean motion trend @xmath182 and obtained variation @xmath183 of both planets as needed for the computation of ttvs ( eq .  [ ttv ] ) .",
    "the effective eccentricity terms @xmath184 were computed from their definition in eq .",

    "figure  [ f3 ] shows a comparison between the synthetic ttvs from direct numerical integration ( gray symbols ) compared to the @xmath185 function from eq .",
    "( [ ttv ] ) ( black line ) . for sake of the example we assumed an ideal situation with both planets transiting . as mentioned in sec .",
    "2.2 , we used a small change in the initial conditions of the secular theory , namely rescaled the @xmath61 parameter by fractionally @xmath186 value , to represent the @xmath155 effect on the mean motion of planets . with that adjustment",
    ", the match between the synthetic ttv series and the modeled function @xmath185 is excellent .",
    "we also note that the contribution of the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ ttv ] ) is negligible and basically all effect seen on the scale of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] is due to the first term ( i.e. , direct perturbation in orbital longitude ) .",
    "the dashed sloped lines on both panels of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] show the effect of a change in mean motion of the planets , as estimated from the simple hamiltonian ( [ ham7 ] ) .",
    "in particular their slopes are : ( i ) @xmath187 at the top panel , and ( ii ) @xmath188 at the bottom panel ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the match to the mean behavior of the ttvs is good , since in the simplest approximation the planets motion may be understood as a periodic switch between two nearly circular orbits . since the period @xmath107 is about 15 times longer than the orbital period of the planets in our case , the effect may accumulate into a large amplitude ttv series .",
    "it is interesting to point out that recognizing the planet s configuration requires observations covering at least the fundamental period @xmath107 of the coorbital motion .",
    "for instance , if the observations would have covered a shorter interval , say between 2.6  yr and 8.3  yr in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , one may not recognize the coorbital signature in the ttvs .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows how the data would have looked in this case .",
    "ttv series of both planets would look quasi - periodic with a period @xmath190  yr , reflecting behavior of the planets mean motion variation over one quarter of the coorbital cycle ( i.e. , when @xmath64 leaps from @xmath106 to @xmath191 , fig .",
    "equation  ( [ t ] ) indicates that @xmath192 , making thus the necessary observational timescale ( i ) shorter for closer - in planets , and ( ii ) longer for less massive planets .",
    "so for instance @xmath193  y periodicity of the ttv series shown in fig .  [ f3 ] would also hold for about @xmath194  earth mass coorbiting planets at about @xmath195  au distance ( i.e. , @xmath196  d revolution period ) from a solar mass star .",
    "these are very typical systems observed by the kepler satellite .",
    "consider now an ideal situation when both planets are transiting and a long enough series of ttvs are recorded for both of them ( e.g. , fig .  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "analysis based on approximate hamiltonian ( [ ham7 ] ) then suggests ( sec .",
    "2.1 ) that the ratio of maximum amplitudes of the ttv series , to be denoted @xmath197 for the more massive planet and @xmath198 for the less massive planet , is equal to the ratio of their masses : @xmath199 . since @xmath200 can be measured from the observations , the mass ratio of the coorbital planets is readily constrained . to verify validity of this conclusion ,",
    "we numerically integrated a complete hamiltonian in poincar rectangular coordinates with a solar mass star having two coorbital planets with masses @xmath167  m@xmath131 and @xmath5 ranging values @xmath201",
    "m@xmath131 to @xmath202  m@xmath131 .",
    "we used @xmath133  au and set the planets initially at opposition , i.e. giving them @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the initial eccentricity values were assumed small , @xmath203 , and pericenter longitudes @xmath170 .",
    "for each of the mass configurations considered , we followed the system for 1000  yr and derived the synthetic ttv series as shown by symbols in fig .",
    "we then fitted the maximum amplitudes @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "their ratio is shown by black circles in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , while the gray line is the expected direct proportionality relation mentioned above .",
    "we note the linear trend is a very good approximation .",
    "another useful parametric constraint is hinted by eq .",

    "since @xmath208 can be directly constrained from the observations , eq .",
    "( [ link2 ] ) provides a link between the mass factor @xmath122 and @xmath106 .",
    "we tested the validity of eq .",
    "( [ link2 ] ) by directly by integrating the planetary system in poincar rectangular coordinates .",
    "the model parameters were mostly the same as above , except for : ( i ) fixing now the planetary masses @xmath167  m@xmath131 and @xmath168  m@xmath131 , and ( ii ) starting the two planets at a nominal closest approach , @xmath209 , @xmath172 and @xmath210  au .",
    "both were given small initial eccentricity @xmath203 , and the system was propagated for 1000  yr with the burlish - stoer integrator .",
    "we recorded series of planetary transits and constructed a synthetic ttvs , similar to ones shown in fig .",
    "the code also provided numerical mean values of the planetary orbital periods , used to compute @xmath211 , half - period @xmath107 of the ttv series , and the mean value of the minimum planetary separation .",
    "this last parameter was obviously very close to the given initial distance @xmath106 , but typically differed from it by few tenths of a degree because of the effect of planetary eccentricities . with those parameters determined for the direct numerical model",
    ", we have all data needed to test the validity of eq .",
    "( [ link2 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown by black circles in fig .",
    "the gray line is the @xmath212 integral from eq .",
    "( [ jint ] ) , computed by a romberg s scheme with controlled accuracy .",
    "note that this integration needs a simple parameter transformation to remove the integrand singularity at @xmath213 limit .",
    "we note a very good correspondence of the numerical results with the expected trend from the analytic theory .",
    "once we verified the validity of eq .",
    "( [ link2 ] ) , we can use it as shown in fig .",
    "here the abscissa is the minimum planet separation @xmath106 , while the ordinate is now the ratio @xmath208 given for a set of different @xmath214 values ( solid lines ) .",
    "the @xmath208 factor may be directly constraint from the observations and fig .",
    "[ f7 ] hints that this information may be immediately used to roughly delimit the @xmath214 factor .",
    "this is because @xmath106 can span only limited range of value for the horseshoe orbits : ( i ) @xmath106 can not approach too closely to the theoretical limit @xmath215 derived in sec .",
    "2.1 , especially of @xmath145 and @xmath146 are non - zero , otherwise instability near the lagrangian point l3 would onset , and ( ii ) @xmath106 can not be too small , otherwise instability near the lagrangian points l1 and l2 would onset . while not performing a complete study here , assume for sake of an example that @xmath106 could be in the interval @xmath216 to @xmath217 . then if @xmath218 is obtained from the observations ( as shown by the dashed gray line a in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) , the @xmath214 ratio can not be much larger than @xmath219 . on the other hand , in @xmath220",
    "is obtained from the observations ( as shown by the dashed gray line b in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) , the @xmath214 ratio can not be much smaller than @xmath221 .",
    "hence the observations may directly hint the nature of planets in the coorbital motion .",
    "so far we discussed properties of ttvs obtained for the two planets .",
    "this is because these series rely on transit observations of each of the planets individually . while we have seen that a more complete information could be obtained when we have ttvs for both planets , some constraints were available even if transits of the larger planet are observed only .",
    "we now return to the ideal case , when transits of both planets are observed and note that even more complete information may be obtained by combining transit series of both planets .",
    "consider a series of transit instants @xmath222 of the second ( less massive , say ) planet and the consecutive transit instants @xmath223 of the first planet .",
    "we may then construct a series of their difference @xmath224 as a function of the transit number .",
    "using our example system from above , this information is shown in fig .",
    "as expected , @xmath224 has the characteristic triangular , sawtooth shape which basically follows from the time dependence of the planets angular separation @xmath71 and spans values between zero and mean orbital period of the planets .",
    "consequently , the minimum value of @xmath224 , which we denote @xmath225 , is directly related to the minimum angular separation @xmath106 of the planets .",
    "similarly , the average value of @xmath224 , say @xmath226 , is one half the mean orbital period of the planets ( and when @xmath227 , the planets are at opposition ) . as a result @xmath228",
    "since @xmath225 and @xmath226 are in principle discerned from observations , @xmath106 can be fairly well constrained as well . in the same way ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath224 , say @xmath229 , provides @xmath230 as an example , @xmath106 estimated from the series in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] is @xmath231 , which is very close to the numerically obtained value of @xmath232 . with",
    "@xmath106 constrained , we note that the ttvs analysis using eq .",
    "( [ link2 ] ) provides an independent , correlated constraint of @xmath106 and the normalized sum of planetary masses @xmath233 .",
    "henceforth , @xmath122 can be directly obtained .",
    "if combined with the information about their ratio @xmath234 discussed above , we finally note that individual planetary masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( given in @xmath3 units ) can be determined from the observations .",
    "while still awaiting for the first confirmed exoplanetary coorbital configuration , we derived here simple parametric relations that could be revealed from the ttv series of a such a system . from all possible coorbital architectures we chose here the horseshoe case that provides ttvs having the most singular nature .",
    "this is because at the zero order one may consider this situation as two non - interacting planets that periodically switch their orbits around some mean distance @xmath55 from the star . instead of sinusoidal in nature ,",
    "the ttvs thus resemble a triangular - shaped series with the half - period @xmath107 of the coorbital motion .    in an ideal case , where ttvs of both planets are observed ,",
    "we find that the characteristics of a complete - enough dataset of planetary transits may directly provide information about their masses .",
    "this is because the ratio of the ttv amplitudes constrains directly the ratio of the planetary masses .",
    "additionally , time separation between the transits of the two planets allows to constrain their minimum angular separation @xmath106 as seen from the star .",
    "this information , if combined with eq .",
    "( [ link2 ] ) , then provides a constraint on the the sum @xmath207 of the planet s masses in units of the stellar mass @xmath3 .",
    "even if ttvs of only larger coorbiting planet are observed , say , one may use eq .",
    "( [ link2 ] ) to relate the total mass of planets , @xmath235 , to their minimum angular separation @xmath106 .",
    "this only requires the data constrain @xmath107 and the mean orbital period @xmath211 , or rather their ratio @xmath208 .",
    "since the available range of @xmath106 value is limited for stable orbital configurations , the value @xmath208 itself roughly sets a possible range of planetary mass , allowing us to distinguish cases with jupiter - mass planets as opposed to the super - earth - mass planets participating in the coorbital motion ."
