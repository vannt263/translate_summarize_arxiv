    "magnetic fields are known to play a significant role in determining the equilibrium state of the plasma in the solar atmosphere and solar wind ( e.g. , parker 1975 , 1991 ; narain and ulmschneider , 1990 , 1996 ; priest 1999 ) .",
    "much of the magnetic flux in the `` quiet '' photosphere seems to be concentrated into small ( 100200 km ) intergranular flux tubes .",
    "the physical processes that heat the chromosphere and corona have not yet been identified definitively , but there is little doubt that magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects are prevalent .",
    "even many proposed nonmagnetic mechanisms depend on the underlying properties of the magnetically structured atmosphere .",
    "the outflowing solar wind is fed by open magnetic flux tubes , and many mhd processes have been proposed to deposit heat and momentum at locations ranging from the extended corona to interplanetary space .",
    "the continually evolving convection below the photosphere gives rise to a wide spectrum of mhd fluctuations in the magnetic atmosphere and wind .",
    "the propagation of waves through the solar atmosphere has been studied for more than a half century ( alfvn 1947 ; schwarzschild 1948 ; biermann 1948 ) . although compressible ( e.g. , acoustic and magnetoacoustic ) mhd waves are likely to be dynamically and energetically important in some regions of the atmosphere , it is the mainly incompressible alfvn mode that has been believed for many years to be dominant in regions that are _ open to the heliosphere _ ( e.g. , osterbrock 1961 ; kuperus , ionson , & spicer 1981 ) . indeed ,",
    "the mhd fluctuations measured by spacecraft in the solar wind have a strongly alfvnic character ( belcher & davis 1971 ; hollweg 1975 ; tu & marsch 1995 ; goldstein , roberts , & matthaeus 1995 ) .    even though much has been learned about the generation , propagation , reflection , and damping of alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere , most earlier studies have focused on only a finite range of heights and treated the interactions with regions above or below as boundary conditions .",
    "this necessarily involved the approximation that the relevant phenomena are mainly local , i.e. , that they do not depend on the conditions very far away from the region being modeled .",
    "there are circumstances , however , for which this approximation breaks down .",
    "for example , the properties of reflecting alfvn waves with long periods ( i.e. , of order 1 day ) in the solar wind depend formally on the conditions `` at infinity , '' since they behave asymptotically as standing waves ( e.g. , heinemann & olbert 1980 ) .    in this paper",
    "we construct a comprehensive model of the radially evolving properties of alfvnic fluctuations in a representative open magnetic region of the solar atmosphere and fast solar wind .",
    "the model takes account of nonlocal interactions by tracing the waves from their origin as transverse flux - tube oscillations in the photosphere all the way out to the interplanetary medium ( truncated for convenience at 4 au ) .",
    "this is done with the smallest possible number of free parameters .",
    "there are two overall aims of this paper :    1 .",
    "we wish to understand better the global `` energy budget '' of alfvn waves , including relative amplitudes of inward and outward propagating waves , along the open flux tubes that feed the solar wind .",
    "2 .   in order to determine how mhd turbulence contributes to the heating of the extended solar corona , we need to pin down precisely how alfvn waves provide the natural preconditions for a turbulent cascade .",
    "the second aim above was motivated by a recent study of the small - scale dissipation of mhd turbulence in the extended corona ( cranmer & van ballegooijen 2003 ) .",
    "this kinetic dissipation depends strongly on how the turbulence is excited at its largest scales , and in this paper we attempt to put the `` outer scale '' wave dynamics on firmer footing so that the resulting `` inner scale '' can be better understood .",
    "the work described by this paper builds on prior studies by hollweg ( 1973 , 1978a , 1981 , 1990 ) , heinemann & olbert ( 1980 ) , spruit ( 1981 , 1984 ) , an et al .",

    "( 1999 ) , hasan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and many others .",
    "one unique aspect of this paper is that the photospheric spectrum of transverse fluctuations  which constrains the alfvn wave amplitudes at all larger radii  is specified directly from detailed observations of magnetic bright point ( mbp ) motions and is not ( as in many other models ) given as an arbitrary boundary amplitude .",
    "however , a complete physical description of the fluctuations in the photosphere ( e.g. , the relative inward / outward amplitudes and the kinetic / magnetic energy partition ) is obtained only after the fully nonlocal wave reflection has been computed for all radii .",
    "another way this work differs from many previous models is that the expansion and successive merging of flux tubes on granular and supergranular scales is described using a two - dimensional model of a magnetic network element in the inhomogeneous solar atmosphere .    despite the attempted comprehensiveness of this model",
    ", we needed to make three specific approximations in order to render the calculations tractable .",
    "these approximations are summarized here , but they are also discussed further below and justified for certain regimes of applicability .",
    "first , we ignore all effects of compressible fluctuations ( e.g. , acoustic waves ; fast and slow magnetosonic waves ) despite their importance in understanding observed intensity oscillations and chromospheric heating .",
    "this is done in order to fairly assess the relative importance of the incompressible alfvn mode before resorting to more involved models .",
    "second , the alfvn wave model is mainly linear , which limits its applicability in regions where the wave amplitudes become large in comparison to background field strengths and characteristic speeds .",
    "( some effects of nonlinearity are examined , though , in   6 . )",
    "third , we do not model explicitly the back - reaction of the waves on the mean properties of the solar atmosphere and solar wind .",
    "we do , however , compute quantities such as the wave pressure acceleration and turbulent heating rate for use in future models of this back - reaction .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we give an overview of the physical processes to be incorporated in the wave models together with a `` cartoon '' description of the steady - state magnetic field topology . in ",
    "3 we describe the adopted steady - state ( i.e. , zero - order ) plasma conditions in detail . the specification of the photospheric frequency spectrum of transverse fluctuations is given in   4 , and the wave equations to be solved are given in ",
    "solutions of these equations , including some with various prescriptions for damping , are presented in   6 .",
    "we conclude with a summary of major results (   7 ) and a discussion of remaining issues (   8) .",
    "appendix a contains supplementary equations describing analytic solutions of the kink - mode wave equations for isolated flux tubes in an isothermal atmosphere .",
    "appendix b compares various published formalisms for the non - wkb transport equations for alfvn waves in an accelerating wind .",
    "appendix c summarizes the properties of the fully developed anisotropic mhd turbulence spectrum discussed by , e.g. , cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2003 ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the basic magnetic field geometry that we believe is representative of flux tubes that feed the high - speed solar wind .",
    "a key feature of the adopted configuration is the successive merging of strong - field magnetic flux tubes between granules ( figure 1a ) and supergranules ( figure 1b ) . on the largest scales ,",
    "figure 1c shows the more or less axisymmetric magnetic field that is characteristic of solar minimum ( using the field model of banaszkiewicz , axford , & mckenzie 1998 ) , but nearly all of the work presented in this paper can also be applied straightforwardly to open - field regions at other phases of the solar cycle .",
    "we assert that most of the plasma that eventually becomes the time - steady solar wind originates in intergranular magnetic flux tubes known observationally as g - band bright points , network bright points , or in groups as `` solar filigree . ''",
    "this assertion is seemingly uncontroversial ( knowing what we do about solar magnetic fields ) , though it is seldom stated . adopting a ripening convention in nomenclature , we refer to these 100200 km size photospheric features as _ magnetic bright points _",
    "bright points in the chromosphere ( rutten & uitenbroek 1991 ) or the still larger x - ray bright points in the low corona ( e.g. , golub et al .   1977 ; parnell 2002 ) . ]",
    "high - resolution observations reveal the presence of mbps in the dark lanes between granules , and these features are associated with regions of strong ( 12 kg ) magnetic field believed to be contained within nearly vertical flux tubes ( e.g. , sheeley 1967 ; dunn & zirker 1973 ; muller 1983 , 1985 ; piddington 1978 ; rabin 1992 ; solanki 1993 ; berger & title 2001 ) .",
    "there is increasing evidence for magnetic structures on even smaller scales than 100200 km , but we leave the study of these structures to future work ( see , e.g. , stein & nordlund 2002 ; snchez almeida , emonet , & cattaneo 2003 ; trujillo bueno , shchukina , & asensio ramos 2004 ) .",
    "as magnetic flux rises stochastically from the convection zone to the photosphere ( e.g. , priest , heyvaerts , & title 2002 ) , field lines are simultaneously jostled horizontally by fluid motions on granular ( 12 mm ) scales .",
    "magnetic flux is concentrated into thin tubes by some combination of `` flux expulsion '' from the upflowing granule centers to the downflowing lanes ( parker 1963 ) , the rapid evacuation of these downflowing superadiabatic regions ( i.e. , convective collapse ; parker 1978 ; spruit 1979 ) , and enhanced radiative cooling leading to thermal relaxation ( snchez almeida 2001 ) .",
    "mbps are observed frequently to merge with neighboring flux elements and to spontaneously fragment into several pieces ( e.g. , berger et al .",
    "once formed , mbps continue to be shaken back and forth by the underlying convective motions ( kulsrud 1955 ; osterbrock 1961 ; van ballegooijen 1986 ; huang , musielak , & ulmschneider 1995 ) , which results in various kinds of wavelike fluctuations describable in the `` thin - tube '' mhd limit ( spruit 1981 , 1982 , 1984 ; see further references in   5.1 below ) .",
    "oscillatory motions can also be induced by impulsive reconnection events ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1991 ) or , conversely , the random wave trains may display observational time signatures that could be misinterpreted as small - scale flaring ( moriyasu et al .   2004 ) .",
    "there is a great variety of mhd wave activity expected and observed in the inhomogeneous solar atmosphere .",
    "in addition to isolated mbp fluctuations , there is ambient acoustic wave energy excited by convection , shock steepening in the chromosphere and transition region , and both driven and free oscillations in sunspots and coronal loops ( see recent reviews by axford et al .",
    "1999 ; roberts 2000 ; bogdan 2000 ; hirzberger 2003 ) . a significant fraction of the sun s magnetic flux",
    "may also be distributed _ outside _ the mbps , network , and active regions ( e.g. , schrijver & title 2003 ) , and acoustic waves in `` field - free '' regions may in fact be magnetoacoustic . damping of mhd waves and turbulence has been a key ingredient in many proposed models of chromospheric and coronal heating .",
    "our main focus , though , is on the incompressible waves that eventually escape from the atmosphere into the solar wind .",
    "magnetic flux tubes rooted in mbps undergo both transverse ( kink - mode ) and longitudinal ( sausage - mode ) oscillations that can propagate upward from the photosphere . because the strong - field flux tubes are in horizontal pressure equilibrium with the surrounding weak - field material , they have a lower density and thus are susceptible to buoyancy effects and evanescence for long enough periods . like acoustic waves ,",
    "the compressible longitudinal modes steepen into shocks and damp over a few scale heights , while the incompressible kink modes can propagate into the corona relatively undamped .",
    "nonlinear effects can lead to mode conversion between kink and longitudinal modes ( e.g. , ulmschneider , zhringer , & musielak 1991 ) .    somewhere in the low chromosphere , the thin flux tubes are believed to expand laterally to the point where they merge with one another into a homogeneous network field distribution ( spruit 1984 ; pneuman , solanki , & stenflo 1986 ; gu et al .",
    "1997 ) . at this point , the thin - tube description breaks down and standard mhd wave theory becomes more applicable ( i.e. , kink modes become transverse alfvn waves ) .",
    "the merged network flux bundles have horizontal scale lengths of 2 to 6 mm and are probably maintained by large - scale convective flows that push the field to the edges of supergranular cells . at a larger height  still below the chromosphere - corona transition region ",
    "the network magnetic field expands laterally to 1030 mm scales and is thought to merge again into a large - scale `` canopy '' ( e.g. , kopp & kuperus 1968 ; gabriel 1976 ; giovanelli 1980 ; anzer & galloway 1983 ; dowdy , rabin , & moore 1986 ) .",
    "the spatial scale of the canopy is set by the typical distance between network flux bundles ( i.e. , the size of supergranulation cells ) in the chromosphere .",
    "observational evidence for preferential wind acceleration in the rapidly expanding network `` funnels '' is growing ( rottman , orrall , & klimchuk 1982 ; hassler et al .",
    "1999 ; peter & judge 1999 ; aiouaz et al .",
    "2004 ; see also martnez - galarce et al .",
    "2003 ) but is still not definitive ( e.g. , dupree , penn , & jones 1996 ) .",
    "as waves propagate upward into the corona , the radially varying alfvn speed allows for gradual linear reflection ( ferraro & plumpton 1958 ) .",
    "the transition region can also act a sharp `` reflection barrier '' to alfvn waves with wavelengths exceeding the local scale length of the alfvn speed in that thin zone ( see   6 ) .",
    "it is thus possible for a time - steady superposition of upward and downward propagating alfvn waves to be maintained ( e.g. , hollweg 1981 , 1984 ) .",
    "strong reflection is not necessarily an impediment to there being a substantial upward wave flux ; one merely needs more power in the upward modes than in the downward modes .",
    "somewhere in the solar atmosphere the mhd fluctuations become turbulent , but it is unclear whether the turbulent cascade becomes energetically important in the photosphere ( petrovay 2001 ) , in the chromosphere and transition region ( chae , schhle , & lemaire 1998 ) , or in the corona ( e.g. , dmitruk & matthaeus 2003 ) .    in the extended corona ,",
    "the high - speed solar wind begins to accelerate supersonically above a heliocentric distance of 2 to 3 solar radii ( @xmath0 ) . in the radially inhomogeneous wind",
    ", the dissipationless propagation of mhd waves does work on the mean fluid and provides an added wave - pressure acceleration ( e.g. , belcher 1971 ; jacques 1977 ; leer , holzer , & fl 1982 ) .",
    "the presence of the wind also modifies how waves propagate , and above the alfvn critical point  where the wind speed equals the local alfvn speed at about 10 @xmath0both the inward and outward modes are advected outward with the wind .",
    "large coronal holes are the most probable source regions for the fast solar wind ( for a review of observations and theoretical models , see cranmer 2002 ) .",
    "some flux tubes in coronal holes have a higher density than the surrounding open - field plasma ; these `` polar plumes '' seem to trace out the superradial expansion of the merged - canopy magnetic field in the corona ( e.g. , deforest , lamy , & llebaria 2001 ) .",
    "in addition to alfvn waves , there is some evidence for both fast - mode and slow - mode magnetosonic waves in the corona ( ofman , nakariakov , & deforest 1999 ; nakariakov et al .",
    "2004 ) , but they have been observed only in relatively confined regions such as loops and plumes .",
    "fast and slow modes are believed to be more attenuated by collisional damping processes than alfvn waves before they reach the corona .",
    "however , once some fraction of the energy flux of alfvn ( and possibly fast - mode ) waves escapes into the solar wind , the classical transport theory of collisional damping begins to break down and collisionless wave - particle interactions should dominate the damping ( e.g. , hollweg & isenberg 2002 ; marsch , axford , & mckenzie 2003 ; cranmer 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2004 ; and many references therein ) .",
    "studies of wave - particle resonance damping have seen a recent resurgence of interest because of their potential importance in producing the preferential ion heating and acceleration seen both in the extended corona ( kohl et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) and in  situ ( marsch 1999 ) .",
    "as alfvn waves propagate into interplanetary space , their velocity and magnetic - field amplitudes grow to nonlinear magnitudes ( i.e. , @xmath1 becomes of order unity ) .",
    "higher order ponderomotive effects begin to dominate the wave propagation equations ( lau & siregar 1996 ) and collisionless wave - wave resonances can create additional mode coupling and damping ( lee & vlk 1973 ; lacombe & mangeney 1980 ; lou 1993 ) . at some point",
    "it may even be inappropriate to use a `` wavelike '' paradigm to discuss the increasingly turbulent fluctuations ( e.g. , goldstein et al .",
    "in the outer heliosphere , the description of magnetic flux tubes as relatively closed systems  implicit in the above discussion  breaks down as well , since processes such as stream - stream interactions , interstellar pickup ion injection , and cosmic ray transport increasingly dominate the physics .    in this paper",
    "we purposefully examine only a subset of the many processes listed above .",
    "this is done mainly to keep the modeling tractable , but it also helps clarify the extent to which the _ specific wave modes that we study _ can account for various observations .",
    "models of linear waves depend sensitively on the assumed background zero - order plasma properties ( e.g. , density , flow speed , magnetic field strength , flux tube geometry ) . in this section",
    "we describe the empirically constrained time - steady plasma along the central axis of a radially pointed ( but superradially expanding ) magnetic flux tube , from the photosphere to a distance of 4 au .",
    "the empirical description consists of two parts : a two - dimensional magnetostatic model of thin mbp flux tubes that expand into the supergranular network canopy (   3.1 ) and a one - dimensional analytic continuation of the plasma parameters in the extended corona , assumed here to be along the axis of symmetry of a polar coronal hole at solar minimum (   3.2 ) .",
    "we first develop a two - dimensional numerical model of a supergranular network element as a collection of thin flux tubes .",
    "the gas pressure in the atmosphere decreases with increasing height , causing a lateral expansion of the flux tubes .",
    "neighboring mbp flux tubes within the network element merge into a monolithic structure at some height @xmath2 .",
    "( heights @xmath3 are measured from the optical - depth - unity photosphere ; radii @xmath4 are measured from sun center . ) for a thin , isothermal flux tube in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings , the interior magnetic field strength varies with height as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure scale height ( e.g. , spruit 1981 , 1984 ) .",
    "thus we determine the so - called _ merging height _ by solving for @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the field strength inside the flux tube at the base of the photosphere ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is the average flux density in the network patch .",
    "observations of the mbp flux - tube field strength range between 1000 and 2000 g , and the network - averaged field strength varies between about 20 and 300 g ( e.g. , gabriel 1976 ; giovanelli 1980 ) . in order to determine a representative value for the merging height we use @xmath11 km , @xmath12 g , and @xmath13 g to obtain @xmath14 km , a height in the low chromosphere",
    "( see also pneuman et al .",
    "1986 ) . above the merging height",
    "the network element consists of a single thick flux tube that further expands with height .",
    "the outer edge of this tube forms a magnetic canopy that overlies the neighboring supergranular cells .",
    "a second merging occurs when neighboring network elements come together at a `` canopy height '' @xmath15 above the supergranular cell centers ; we set @xmath16 mm ( see also hasan et al .",
    "figure 2 shows the three - part structure of the network element :    1 .",
    "the region below the merging height ( @xmath17 mm ) is described as a collection of thin flux tubes embedded in a field - free medium .",
    "the field strength @xmath18 is assumed to be the same for all flux tubes , and their cross sections and other plasma properties are consistent with the thin - tube approximation .",
    "2 .   between heights of 0.6 and 1 mm , the merged network flux element expands laterally to the edges of the supergranular cell , which overlies a field - free cell - center chromosphere .",
    "3 .   between 1 and 12 mm , the `` fully merged '' magnetic field fills the supergranular cell volume and expands primarily in the vertical direction .    in the remainder of this paper ,",
    "the term `` merging height '' refers specifically to the merging of the thin flux tubes at @xmath19  mm .",
    "the total magnetic flux @xmath20 of the network element is constrained empirically to be @xmath21 mx .",
    "the mbp field strengths at the photosphere and at the merging height are 1430 g and 120.4 g , respectively .",
    "the upper , monolithic part of the magnetic structure ( @xmath22 ) is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric and is described by a modified version of the magnetostatic flux tube model of hasan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in the present case ,",
    "the flux tube is contained within a cylinder of transverse radius @xmath23 mm , which simulates the effect of neighboring network elements .",
    "the internal and external gas pressures are taken from semiempirical val / fal models by vernazza , avrett , & loeser ( 1981 ) and fontenla , avrett , & loeser ( 1990 , 1991 , 1993 , 2002 ) .",
    "the magnetic field components @xmath24 and @xmath25 in cylindrical geometry ( using @xmath26 as the perpendicular distance from the central flux tube axis ) are computed by varying the shapes of the field lines until a minimum - energy state is obtained ( for details see hasan et al .   2003 ) .",
    "the horizontal distribution of @xmath27 at the merging height is adjusted iteratively such that the magnitude of the field @xmath28 is independent of @xmath26 .",

    "figure 2 shows the final iterated magnetic structure .",
    "the cross sections of the flux tubes below the merging height ( @xmath29 mm ) were computed by matching @xmath30 and @xmath31 at the merging height and assuming that @xmath30 is independent of height within each flux tube ( different tubes have different @xmath30 ) .",
    "the transverse radius of the `` network patch '' in the photosphere is about 3 mm .",
    "we can estimate the number @xmath32 of mbps inside the approximately circular patch , but we note that the wave analysis below does not depend on the value of @xmath32 . from the conservation of magnetic flux , we know that the filling factor of mbp flux tubes at the photosphere is given by @xmath33 .",
    "observationally , the transverse radii of mbps at the photosphere are 50 to 100 km . the number of flux tubes required to fill an area that is 8% of the total patch area ( @xmath34 , with @xmath35 mm ) ranges between @xmath36 ( for the upper limit on mbp radius ) and @xmath37 ( for the lower limit ) .",
    "we can also define a mean distance between nearest neighbors @xmath38 by dividing up up the network patch into @xmath32 equal - area circles and defining @xmath38 as twice their radii .",
    "thus , @xmath39 , which gives values of 350 and 700 km for the above limiting cases .    before continuing , it is worthwhile to ask the question : `` why is it not possible to extend the ` monolithic ' flux - tube model all the way down to the photosphere ? ''",
    "observationally , the photosphere is far from monolithic in its distribution of magnetic fields .",
    "granulation causes both the formation of thin mbp flux tubes and their spreading out ( via random walk ) .",
    "the larger - scale supergranulation pushes the magnetic elements back together into network lanes and vertices . this competition between mbp spreading and",

    "lastly , in figure 12 we plot the frequency - integrated energy flux density @xmath239 for the baseline @xmath229 km s@xmath61 case . below the merging height this quantity applies to the energy flux carried upward by the mbp kink modes , and above the merging height it applies to the volume - filling alfvn waves .",
    "the wave flux is defined generally as @xmath240 which is based on the monochromatic definition given by heinemann & olbert ( 1980 ) . for outward propagating waves obeying wave action conservation , one can write @xmath241",
    ". in the lowest layers of the atmosphere one can also ignore the factors above that depend on @xmath57 and thus the net flux depends mainly on the difference between @xmath242 and @xmath243 . because of the strong reflection below the transition region there is strong cancellation ; i.e. , the magnitude of the purely outward wave flux @xmath244 exceeds the net flux by a factor of about 20 .",

    "analysis of a series of models having a range of @xmath101 values yields a potentially useful explicit expression for the photospheric wave flux in the mbps .",

[ [ eq : dvphot ] ] ) , we have fit the numerically computed photospheric fluxes with the following function : @xmath245 with less than 0.1% uncertainty in the fit ( mainly due to roundoff error in the above expression having only three significant figures ) .",

    "this occurs because the bulk of the power in the jump motions is at higher frequencies than the walk motions and is less susceptible to evanescent decay .",
    "the flux is a frequency - integrated quantity that incorporates this aspect of the solutions , whereas the velocity variance does not .",
    "we also plot in figure 12 several other flux quantities .",
    "the `` granule - averaged '' wave flux is given by the quantity @xmath250 ( for the flux tube filling factor @xmath152 , see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : phidef ] ] ) , and it differs from @xmath239 itself only below the merging height .",
    "the quantity @xmath250 spreads the wave energy out evenly within the modeled network patch , and thus is a more relevant quantity to compare with observations and predictions of wave fluxes that arise in the network from the convection .",
    "note that the photospheric value of @xmath251 erg @xmath60 s@xmath61 is of similar magnitude as the _ acoustic _ wave flux of @xmath252 erg @xmath60 s@xmath61 predicted by musielak et al .",
    "we also plot a `` supergranule - averaged '' flux @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is a filling factor for the large - scale funnel / canopy magnetic structure shown in figure 2 .",

    "the quantity @xmath253 is what one would use in order to compute the total wave power ( in erg s@xmath61 ) integrated over the entire coronal hole .      in this section",
    "we discuss two separate mechanisms that have been proposed to damp alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere and solar wind : viscosity (   6.2.1 ) and mhd turbulent cascade (   6.2.2 ) .",
    "for clarity we do not treat these mechanisms together , though in a completely self - consistent model all damping mechanisms should be included and allowed to interact with one another .",
    "the first damping mechanisms proposed for mhd waves in the solar corona were collisional in nature ( alfvn 1947 ; osterbrock 1961 ) . in the high - density plasma near the sun , mhd waves can be damped by viscosity , thermal conductivity , electrical resistivity ( i.e. , joule / ohmic heating ) , and ion - neutral friction .",
    "for alfvn and fast - mode waves propagating parallel to the magnetic field , though , the dominant collisional dissipation channel in the corona is believed to be proton viscosity .",
    "here we estimate the viscous damping expected for the background plasma conditions described above and find it to be negligible .",
    "we compute a collisional damping length @xmath255 as a function of height @xmath3 , and there should be appreciable damping only where @xmath256 . generally , the product of the damping length and a linear damping rate @xmath257 ( i.e. , the imaginary part of the frequency ) is the wave group velocity @xmath258 in the inertial frame , given here for dispersionless alfvn waves as @xmath259 . for viscous damping , @xmath260 , where @xmath261 is the proton kinematic viscosity and @xmath262 is the radial wavenumber ( van de hulst 1951 ; osterbrock 1961 ) .",
    "thus , for alfvn waves propagating upward and parallel to the background magnetic field , this leads to the general expression @xmath263 ( tu 1984 ; whang 1980 , 1997 ) . in a strongly collisional plasma",
    "the kinematic viscosity is given by the classical braginskii ( 1965 ) formalism ( see also hollweg 1986a ) .",
    "in the collisionless solar wind , though , there is no clear prescription for the effective viscosity .",
    "we thus define the proton kinematic viscosity phenomenologically as @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the proton most - probable speed , @xmath266 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath267 is the proton temperature , @xmath268 is the proton mass , and @xmath269 is an effective viscous timescale . we adopt a fiducial proton temperature law for this analysis that comes from the semiempirical val / fal model ( used for the magnetostatic flux tube model ) below @xmath270 , and we use @xmath271 above 1.0172 @xmath0 .",
    "this expression reasonably reproduces the proton temperatures measured by _",
    "helios _ and _ ulysses _ in the highest - speed solar wind ( tu , freeman & lopez 1989 ; goldstein et al .",
    "1996 ) and it has a peak in the extended corona of @xmath2022.2 mk in general agreement with uvcs/_soho _ ly@xmath272 measurements ( e.g. , kohl et al .   1998 ; esser et al .   1999 ) .    for strong collisional coupling ,",
    "the effective viscous time scale @xmath269 is given by the mean time between collisions ( braginskii 1965 ) , @xmath273 where @xmath274 is the proton / electron charge and @xmath275 is the coulomb logarithm , taken here to be 21 .",
    "the above timescale applies to the viscous damping of motions _ along _ the magnetic field . for shear motions transverse to the field , though , the appropriate viscous time ( even in the limit of strong collisions ) is reduced .",
    "the off - diagonal braginskii coefficients in the stress tensor are obtained approximately by dividing @xmath276 by dimensionless factors that take account of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , @xmath277 where @xmath76 is either 1 or 2 , and @xmath278 is the proton larmor frequency @xmath279 .",
    "the @xmath280 terms are roughly analogous to the direct , hall , and pedersen components of the mhd conductivity in an ionized plasma .    in the low - density collisionless limit , the classical @xmath281 case can not apply because it would imply the viscosity becomes infinitely large as the mean time between collisions becomes infinite ( the `` molasses '' limit ) .",
    "williams ( 1995 ) argued essentially that the general viscosity in a collisional or collisionless plasma is found by taking the shorter of either the @xmath281 or the @xmath282 timescales .",
    "we assert , though , that the @xmath283 case seems to be the most appropriate for the viscous damping of transverse alfvn waves in the collisionless solar wind .",
    "consider the viscosity as an effective diffusion coefficient ( @xmath284 ) describing scattering events with mean - free - path length and time scales of @xmath285 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "the actual energy losses arise from the interparticle collisions with timescale @xmath286 , but spatially the _ transverse _ structure would be dominated by features with sizes of order the proton thermal larmor radius , and thus @xmath287 . for these values",
    "the viscosity reproduces the @xmath283 case .",
    "figure 13 shows the radial dependence of the linear damping length @xmath255 for the three cases , @xmath281 , 1 , and 2 , computed for a wave period of 1 minute . for heights below about 0.3 @xmath0 above the photosphere ,",
    "it is unlikely that any damping would take place because all three cases have damping lengths much longer than the local height .",
    "this mid - corona distance ( @xmath288 to 2 @xmath0 ) is approximately where collisions start to become unimportant in coupling together electron , proton , and heavy ion plasma properties ( e.g. , cranmer , field , & kohl 1999 ) . above this height ,",
    "then , the appropriate damping length should transition to either the @xmath282 or the @xmath283 case , both of which are substantially longer than the local height in the corona . in the far solar wind",
    ", we believe the @xmath283 case is the most realistic , and it always remains several orders of magnitude larger than the local height .",
    "thus , our preliminary conclusion is that for both waves near the peak of the power spectrum ( periods of a one to a few minutes ) , and for longer periods , linear viscous damping is _ unimportant _ as a significant attenuation mechanism for alfvn waves in the corona and fast solar wind . for periods much shorter than 1 minute ,",
    "though , this kind of damping could be important  and may have already been responsible for the sharp drop in power inferred from photospheric mbp motions between 0.1 and 1 minute .",
    "the second type of wave damping we consider is turbulent dissipation ; i.e. , a nonlinear cascade of energy from large to small scales that terminates in an irreversible conversion of wave energy into heat . the need to include some kind of nonlinear damping or saturation can be seen in figure 10 , where above a distance of @xmath20220 @xmath0 the magnetic fluctuation amplitude begins to exceed the background field strength ( in opposition to in  situ observations ) and the linear assumption breaks down . addressing the full problem of anisotropic mhd turbulence in the solar corona and solar wind , though , is well beyond the scope of this paper ( see , though , cranmer & van ballegooijen 2003 for a summary of many related issues ) .",
    "here we include only one specific aspect of this theory : a phenomenological damping rate that depends on the properties of the largest scales in the turbulence and not on the details of the cascade .",
    "the presence of both outward and inward propagating alfvn waves is a necessary prerequisite for the nonlinear coupling to higher wavenumber that drives the cascade ( see , e.g. , matthaeus et al .",
    "1999 ; dmitruk , milano , & matthaeus 2001 ) . any expression for the turbulent energy decay must then depend on both the @xmath167 and @xmath168 elsasser amplitudes , and thus the inclusion of turbulence introduces further coupling between these two modes .",
    "a straightforward phenomenological form for the nonlinear transport has been suggested by zhou & matthaeus ( 1990 ) from the standpoint of `` reduced mhd '' ( rmhd ; see also strauss 1976 ; montgomery 1982 ) .",
    "effectively , the transport equation is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : zpm ] ) , but with the following term added to the right - hand side : @xmath289 where @xmath290 is a transverse length scale representing an effective correlation length of the turbulence  i.e . , a similarity length scale associated with the energy transport from large to small eddies .",
    "( it may be imprecise to refer to this length scale as an `` outer scale , '' but for simplicity we treat this as a synonym . )",
    "we assume that @xmath290 scales with the transverse width of the open flux tube ; i.e. , that it remains proportional to @xmath291 .",
    "specifically , we normalize @xmath290 by specifying its value at the merging height @xmath2 .",
    "we also define the constant @xmath292 as the ratio of @xmath290 at the merging height to the transverse radius of the network flux bundle at that height : 3 mm ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "equivalently , we can express @xmath293 if @xmath41 is measured in gauss ( see also hollweg 1986b ) .    in order to know how best to implement the nonlinear term given above , we need to understand over what range of heights this term acts to appreciably damp the waves .",
    "we do not expect a strong rmhd cascade to develop in the region below the merging height because  despite the stochastic nature of the fluctuation spectrum  the flux tubes do not strongly interact with one another . for heights above @xmath2",
    "we can compare the effective damping length @xmath290 to the local height @xmath3 above the photosphere .",
    "for @xmath294 , we find that @xmath295 only above a height of @xmath296 .",
    "it makes sense that the chromosphere and transition region are not expected to undergo much damping from this rmhd mechanism ; there seems to be insufficient time for the turbulent cascade to develop in such small volumes .",
    "dmitruk & matthaeus ( 2003 ) discussed a hierarchy of timescales that should be satisfied in order for this turbulent damping process to be strong .",
    "a simplified version of this hierarchy is as follows : @xmath297 where @xmath298 is a nonlinear outer - scale eddy cascade time , @xmath299 is a timescale for alfvn wave reflection , and @xmath300 is representative of the main driving period of the waves . in figure 14",
    "we compare several of these quantities to see where these conditions are met .    in figure 14",
    "we plot a representative reflection time @xmath299 which we define as @xmath301 .",
    "this is probably of the same order of magnitude as the dmitruk & matthaeus ( 2003 ) `` alfvn wave crossing time '' @xmath302 , since the latter can be defined as @xmath303 , or the wave travel time over a representative alfvn - speed scale height @xmath304 .",
    "thus , @xmath305 . for reference",
    "we also show the total wave travel time from the photosphere to a given height , defined as @xmath306 we equate the driving period @xmath300 to the spectrum - integrated first - moment period @xmath225 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : omavg ] ] ) and we plot its value for the baseline @xmath229 km s@xmath61 model .",
    "interestingly , @xmath307 only _ below _",
    "@xmath308 , and the hierarchy is not satisfied at large distances where the damping length is relatively small .",
    "note , though , that the demand in the above hierarchy for @xmath300 to be the largest of the three timescales comes only from the well - known non - wkb result that long periods are the easiest to reflect , and thus they provide the most turbulent mixing between inward and outward modes . however , the amount of reflection in our model is a known quantity ( see , e.g. , figures 7 and 11 ) , and it is irrelevant whether it could have been maximized with longer - period waves .",
    "therefore we do not need to consider the last inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tineq ] ) as a precondition for turbulent damping .",
    "the key piece of the dmitruk & matthaeus ( 2003 ) timescale hierarchy is that the nonlinear driving time @xmath298 must be short compared to the reflection time @xmath299 .",
    "only when this condition is satisfied can the turbulent cascade develop to the point where the wave damping can occur efficiently . in appendix c",
    "we describe one way of using a model for the anisotropic turbulent power spectrum to derive @xmath298 ( see also oughton , dmitruk , & matthaeus 2004 ) .",
    "this timescale depends inversely on the outer - scale length @xmath290 , and in figure 14 we plot the radial dependence of @xmath298 for two extreme values of the normalizing constant @xmath292 .",
    "an upper limit to the outer - scale length is given by @xmath294 ( i.e. , that the `` stirring '' takes place on the spatial scale of the entire network element ) .",
    "a reasonable lower limit for @xmath290 at the merging height is the radius of the smallest expected mbp flux tube . at the merging height , the flux tubes have expanded to fill the volume of the network patch , and thus the mbp radius is given by half the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath38 . for the lower - limit value of @xmath309 km",
    "( see   3.1 ) we obtain a lower limit of @xmath310 .",
    "we find in figure 14 that @xmath299 begins to exceed @xmath298 somewhere above a height of 0.1 to 1 @xmath0 .",
    "we thus solve the nonlinearly modified wave transport equation only above 0.1 @xmath0 .",
    "this restriction allows us to make a useful simplifying assumption . as seen in figure 11 , above this height",
    "there is only relatively weak inward wave power ; i.e. , @xmath311 .",
    "we solve a modified time - steady wave action conservation equation in the limit of pure outward propagation .",

    "this is not necessarily a wkb result , but it applies only in regions of negligible reflection .",
    "in the wave transport models presented in this paper we have not been overly concerned with the direction of the alfvn wavevector @xmath413 relative to the background magnetic field @xmath414 .",
    "mainly this is because the dispersion relation of the waves in the mhd limit depends only on @xmath356 , the parallel component of the wavevector , @xmath415 for the @xmath416 modes , and not on the component @xmath357 perpendicular to the field .",

    ", the angle between @xmath413 and @xmath414 ) will evolve with heliocentric distance due to several physical processes .",
    "the radial variations of the inertial - frame phase speeds @xmath418 induce a radial `` stretching '' in wavelength and thus a large - scale decrease in @xmath356 with increasing height .",
    "the transverse spreading of the open flux tube should also cause the perpendicular wavenumber @xmath357 to decrease with increasing height as well .",
    "the overall sense of increase or decrease in @xmath417 depends on the time - steady properties of the magnetic field and outflow .",
    "other effects can contribute to a radial variation in @xmath417 .",
    "first , any transverse gradients of the alfvn speed can refract oblique waves toward the center of the flux tube , thus decreasing @xmath417 ( wentzel 1989 ) .",
    "second , viscous damping of high - frequency waves preferentially dissipates oblique fluctuations , since @xmath419 .",

    "6.2.1 assumed @xmath420 , but the impact of viscous damping can be enhanced significantly if the waves are sufficiently oblique .",
    "all of the above effects should be included if the radial variation of @xmath417 ( or @xmath421 averaged over the power spectrum ) is to be computed .",
    "as the turbulent cascade develops in the corona , an additional nonlinear evolution of the wave energy within `` wavenumber space '' ( @xmath422 ) occurs .",
    "it has been known for several decades that mhd turbulence in the presence of a steady - state magnetic field develops a strong anisotropy in wavenumber .",
    "both numerical simulations and rmhd analytic descriptions indicate that the spectral transport from large to small spatial scales proceeds mainly in the two - dimensional plane perpendicular to @xmath414 ( see , e.g. , higdon 1984 ; shebalin , matthaeus , & montgomery 1983 ; goldreich & sridhar 1995 , 1997 ; bhattacharjee & ng 2001 ; cho , lazarian , & vishniac 2002 ; oughton et al .",
    "that is , the cascade spreads out the power to successively larger values of @xmath357 while leaving @xmath356 relatively unchanged .",
    "here we follow cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2003 ) and give an analytic solution for the turbulent power spectrum in the limit that the cascade is allowed to proceed to its final `` driven '' steady state in a small homogeneous volume of plasma .",
    "we then compare the frequency dependence of this power spectrum to the empirically constrained ( linear ) frequency spectrum as presented in figure 8 .",
    "let us define the three - dimensional total power spectrum as @xmath423 where we write the volume element @xmath424 in cylindrical coordinates as @xmath425 and thus assume symmetry in the two directions transverse to the background field .",

    "this assumption is incompatible with the non - wkb wave reflection models computed in this paper , but we follow the earlier analysis in order to compare the _ shapes _ of the relevant power spectra and to obtain insight about how to better model the turbulent cascade .    for fully developed anisotropic mhd turbulence , we assume the power spectrum to be a separable function of two variables : @xmath357 and a nonlinearity parameter @xmath427 defined as the ratio of the local wind - frame frequency @xmath428 to an assumed nonlinear eddy turnover rate @xmath429 ( see , e.g. , goldreich & sridhar 1995 ) .",

    "we plot the spectra at only one heliocentric distance ( @xmath334 ) and note that one can use the radial dependences of the various timescales plotted in figure 14 in order to extend these results to other heights .",
    "the above assumption of full mixing for the nonlinear cascade ( i.e. , @xmath338 ) is far from the linear non - wkb result of @xmath459 in the extended corona .",
    "the inability of the analytic rmhd anisotropic cascade theory to take account of the strong imbalance between inward and outward wave amplitudes is a major shortcoming of this kind of model .",
    "we need a better understanding of the _ detailed wavenumber dependence _ of the inward - to - outward power ratio for mhd turbulence .",

    "the peaks of the scaled power spectra @xmath463 occur at frequencies of @xmath464 , but the empirically constrained linear spectra @xmath465 contain most of their power at slightly higher frequencies ( i.e. , shorter periods ) .",
    "the fact that the two spectra exhibit maxima within the same order of magnitude of frequency , though , may be just a result of choosing the radius of @xmath334 .",
    "figure 14 shows that if the curves in figure 19 were computed instead at 1 au , the peaks of the linear @xmath466 curves would be in the same range of periods ( 1 to 5 minutes ) , but the peaks of the @xmath454 curves would be at periods between 30 and 40 minutes . at 1",
    "au the bulk of the power in the linear frequency spectrum would be at an extremely high local frequency from the standpoint of the cascade ( i.e. , @xmath467 ) .",
    "this suggests that the sun emits a `` fossil '' frequency spectrum that eventually can advect into a region of the three - dimensional wavenumber spectrum that was previously believed to be strongly _ depleted _ due to the anisotropic cascade .",
