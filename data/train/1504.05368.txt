    "rotation curve of the andromeda galaxy m31 ( ngc 224 ) has been obtained in details and are used for determining the mass distribution in the disk and dark halo ( sofue et al .",
    "1999 ; carignan et al . 2006 ; chemin et al . 2009 ; corbelli et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the dark halo mass beyond the disk has been derived using kinematics of satellite galaxies ( e.g. , metz et al .",
    "2007 ; van der marel et al . 2008 ; tollerud et al . 2012 ) .",
    "globular clusters are also used extensively for the mass determination of dark halo ( veljanovski et al .",
    "2010 ) as well as for inner kinematics ( galletti et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in our recent work on the milky way galaxy",
    ", we constructed a running averaged rotation curve for a wide region from the galactic center to outermost dark halo , which we called the grand ( or pseudo ) rotation curve ( hereafter , grc : sofue 2012 , 2013 ) . in the present paper , we revise the grc by adopting the most recent value of the solar rotation velocity , @xmath2 , from vera observations ( honma et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "we apply a common method to construct grcs to m31 and the milky way by combining disk rotation curves and radial velocities of satellite galaxies and outer globular clusters .",
    "we deconvolve the grcs into bulge , disk and dark halo , and determine the dynamical parameters .",
    "we compare the results for m31 and the milky way , and discuss the similarity of the two galaxies .",
    "it is emphasized that the nfw model indeed works in largely extended dark halos of real galaxies .",
    "the rotation curve of the disk of m31 has been obtained by many authors using hi , co and  line kinematical data as listed in table 1 . for the disk region",
    ", we simply adopt the averaged rotation velocity @xmath3 as a function of radius @xmath4 from these data .",
    "for the halo region beyond the disk , we employ kinematics of non - coplanar objects orbiting m31 , which include satellite galaxies and globular clusters ( table 1 ) .",
    "we adopt a distance to m31 of 770 kpc , and the systemic velocity of 300 ( courteau and van den bergh 1999 )    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tabcomp ]     of m31 obtained by the authors listed in table 3 .",
    "upper ( dashed ) and lower ( fill ) lines show @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , calculated using the fitted parameters of m31 .",
    "big diamonds on the calculated lines indicate the present result.,width=302 ]      in figure [ m31vsmw ] the grc of m31 is compared with the revised grc of the milky way , and the fitting results are compared in table 2 .",
    "there is remarkable similarity of rotation curves inside the disk regions as well as in the dark halos in their shapes and amplitudes .",
    "however , the fitted dark halo mass of m31 is about twice that of the galaxy and the parameters are also different , although the bulge and disk parameters are similar between the two galaxies .",
    "the fitting accuracy in the milky way is not satisfactory , particularly for the bulge component ( figure [ xiamw ] ) , which is mainly due to the fact that the galactic bulge is composed of multiple components , not well represented by the de vaucouleurs law ( sofue 2013 ) .",
    "however , we used the common model to m31 in order to compare the global structures of the two galaxies .",
    "hence , the innermost structure of the milky way may not be taken serious here , while it does not affect the result for the disk and dark halo .",
    "the here determined scale radii and masses for the milky way are systematically greater than those obtained in our previous work ( sofue 2013 ) .",
    "this is because of the adopted larger rotation velocity of the sun , which causes significant increase of the disk rotation velocities , as well as to the revised correction factor of radial velocities of non - coplanar objects .",
    "the ratio of the total mass of the bulge and disk to the dark matter mass , @xmath7@xmath8 , is a measure of the baryonic to dark mass ratio .",
    "the values in table 2 yield the ratio of @xmath9 for m31 , and 0.25 for the galaxy .",
    "these values may be compared with the cosmological value of 0.19 ( = 4.5%/24% ) from the wmap observations ( spergel et al .",
    "this implies that m31 is dark mater dominant compared to the cosmological value , whereas the galaxy is baryon exceeded .",
    "the systemic velocity of m31 with respect to the milky way of @xmath10 ( courteau and van den bergh 1999 ) can be translated to a statistically possible mutual velocity by multiplying @xmath11 to yield @xmath12 , if we assume that the two galaxies motions are random . in order for the two galaxies to be bound ,",
    "a reduced total mass of the whole system is required to be greater than @xmath13 . since both m31 and the galaxy",
    "are far less massive , @xmath14 in total , than this binding mass , there remain two possibilities either that the local group contains dark mass as massive as @xmath15 , or that the two galaxy systems are not gravitaionally bound .    in the former case ,",
    "our view that the local group can be recognized as one system may not be changed .",
    "however , the dark mass must be concentrated around the center of mass of the local group , so that the m31 and the galaxy groups , both associated with own dark halos and embedded satellite galaxies and globular clusters , are not tidally disrupted .    in the latter idea , we need no further assumption of dark mass in the local group , but it is required that m31 and the galaxy and their satellite galaxies have been two individual bound systems since the formation .",
    "in fact , sawa and fujimoto ( 2005 ) proposed a model that dwarf galaxies of the local group are bound either to m31 or the milky way , composing two individual bound groups , and the two groups are orbiting around each other and tidally interacting .",
