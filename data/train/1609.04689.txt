    "phase estimation and optical interferometry are the basis for many precision measurement applications .",
    "coherent light based interferometry is most commonly used but its sensitivity for phase estimation is limited by the shot - noise limit , , where @xmath2 is the unknown phase , and @xmath3 is the mean number of photons used to perform the estimation @xcite .",
    "this is not a problem in the case of limitless resources or in the case of samples that can withstand large doses of radiation .",
    "however , in order to achieve a finer precision given a finite amount of resources , one has to resort to interferometry with quantum states of light , such as n00n states @xcite with parity measurements @xcite , in order to achieve sub - shot - noise or the heisenberg limit ( hl ) to sensitivity of phase estimation . squeezed vacuum , which is the brightest experimentally available nonclassical light , has received much attention . in particular , the two - mode squeezed - vacuum ( tmsv ) which is the simplest two - mode state that contains strong photon - number entanglement , offers a notable improvement in phase estimation precision when compared to coherent states @xcite .",
    "significant advances have been made in quantum - enhanced phase sensitivity @xcite and the meaning of the heisenberg limit has been thoroughly examined @xcite . yet , a proposed phase estimation scheme dips below the hl in the case of an infinite number of parity measurements @xcite .",
    "that scheme is based on measuring the parity of the state of light at the output of a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mzi ] , with two - mode squeezed - vacuum input .",
    "a parity measurement focuses on whether the output photon number is odd or even , rather than the the actual number itself .",
    "it turned out that this particular scheme using tmsv input has sub - heisenberg sensitivity , due to the fact that the photon number uncertainty for the state of light inside of the mzi is greater than the average photon number used for the measurement @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg limit , @xmath4 for states with @xmath5 fixed total number of photons such as twin - fock @xcite or n00n states @xcite and @xmath6 copies of the state , is a rigorous lower limit for _ local _ phase sensitivity for such states @xcite .",
    "however , for states with well - defined mean photon number but undefined total photon number , such as the tmsv used here , it is now understood that the heisenberg limit so defined is not a lower limit .",
    "here we concern ourselves primarily with the cramr - rao bound , which is provably the ultimate limit of phase sensitivity @xcite .",
    "that is , for a measurement providing an unbiased estimate of a parameter @xmath2 , the variance of the estimate can be no less than the cramr - rao bound .",
    "hence , if we saturate this limit , as we do in this work with parity detection , then our measurement scheme is optimal .    unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite where the cramr - rao bound sensitivity is expected in the limit of an infinite number of parity measurements , we consider a finite parity measurement record .",
    "we use the terminology  detection \" to denote measurement on an individual copy of the state , and  measurement record \" to denote the list of parity detections .    in previous schemes considered @xcite , it was unclear as to how an unambiguous estimate could be made , given that the parity of the output is symmetric around the origin .",
    "if one infers the value of the measured phase @xmath2 by only considering the statistics ( number of odd / even outcomes ) of a static interferometer , there is ambiguity in the sign of the phase estimate .",
    "figure  [ fig : amb ] shows the probability distribution for the phase @xmath2 for an example measurement record , generated for an actual phase of @xmath7 .",
    "the distribution has two maxima distributed symmetrically around @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the most sensitive region is confined to a small interval where the relative phase between the two arms of the interferometer is zero , where the ambiguity of the sign is most problematic . moving away from this region",
    ", the phase sensitivity decays quickly .",
    "we introduce a feedback technique described in the following sections and eliminate this ambiguity ; an example of the probability distribution for the phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unamb ] . by implementing an adaptable control phase",
    "@xmath9 we extend the region where the measurement is accurate to the interval ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we show that with a sufficient number of detections , the method achieves heisenberg - limited sensitivity . in this paper",
    "we define the heisenberg limit as @xmath10 @xcite .     for an example",

    "[ sec:2 ] we describe the model of the tmsv state and discuss the problematic features associated with parity measurements . in sec .",

    "we discuss the effects of photon loss in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , then conclude in sec .",
    "we consider a phase estimation scheme with a two - mode squeezed - vacuum input state which is commonly generated in unseeded optical parametric amplifiers .",
    "a tmsv state is ideally a superposition of twin fock states , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath3 is the average photon number in the state @xcite .",
    "parity based phase estimation was originally introduced in quantum optics by gerry @xcite and is based on the parity of the photon number detected at the output of the mzi . since the photon number in a tmsv state is always even , the parity signals are the same in both the output ports , and therefore can be detected by performing photon - counting at only one port .",
    "it turns out that parity detection is sufficient to achieve the cramr - rao bound in the case where the state is path symmetric @xcite , which is the case here .",
    "propagation of the light through a mzi imprints phase information on the state that is retrieved by measuring parity at the output of the mzi . the expected value of the parity signal @xmath17 for a tmsv based phase estimation scheme , @xmath18 was obtained in ref .",
    "equation   was obtained by summing the expected parity value @xmath19 for each twin - fock state @xmath20 , weighted by their respective probability of occurring , @xmath21 where @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath24 @xcite .    a straightforward method for determining the magnitude of the unknown phase @xmath2 is as follows .",
    "if we let the controllable phase be @xmath25 and we know @xmath3 at the input , then we send the tmsv through the mzi of fig .",
    "[ fig : mzi ] , which interrogates the unknown phase @xmath2 . then , we perform parity measurements at the output , which returns either an even or odd outcome with probabilities @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( as defined below ) , respectively .",
    "this allows us to determine the parity signal @xmath28 .",
    "this parity measurement can be implemented with photon - number - resolving detectors or homodyne detection @xcite . inferring the parity of a state disregards the actual number of photons detected and focuses on whether this number is even or odd . since @xmath29 and the expectation value of a state s",
    "parity is @xmath30 , the probabilities of detecting an even or odd photon number are @xmath31 when the estimate is unbiased @xcite , the precision of the estimate is lower - bounded by the cramr - rao bound , @xmath32 , where @xmath6 is the number of times the estimation is repeated and @xmath33 is the fisher information @xcite . in this case , the fisher information is @xmath34 ^ 2}.   \\label{eq : crb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fisher information is maximized for .",
    "therefore , the ultimate precision of this estimation scheme is , which is sub - heisenberg if the bound can be achieved .",
    "when @xmath35 , the scheme performs better than the shot - noise limit .",
    "this would be achieved if @xmath36 is smaller than approximately @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , the sensitivity decays quickly .",
    "one can estimate @xmath2 from the statistics of the detections . in order to choose the estimate",
    ", it is useful to determine a probability density function for the phase based on the detection results .",
    "this probability density can be determined via bayes theorem to be @xmath38 where @xmath6 is the number of parity detections and @xmath39 is the number of even results .",
    "the estimate of @xmath2 could be chosen to be , for example , the maximum of this probability distribution .",
    "one can model phase estimation with tmsv and parity detection numerically in the following way .",
    "choose an average photon number @xmath40 and an unknown phase @xmath2 , then numerically generate a measurement record of finite length @xmath6 using the probabilities @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "from this measurement record the probability density function for @xmath2 can be calculated using eq .  .",
    "an example of a simulation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : amb ] for the case where @xmath9 is constant . with @xmath9 constant",
    ", there is ambiguity in the estimation of @xmath2 , because the distribution is symmetric about 0 .",
    "in order to eliminate this ambiguity , we apply a feedback technique , which changes the controlled phase @xmath9 based upon previous detection results and controlled phases .",
    "intuitively , this method works by maximizing thereby reducing the appearance of multiple peaks @xcite . since , @xmath43 is maximum when @xmath44 is a delta function , and equals zero when @xmath44 is flat . here",
    "we use a variation of the method in ref .",
    "@xcite where we maximize @xmath45 , as explained next .",
    "the adaptive technique uses the latest probability distribution @xmath44 to calculate the next controlled phase .",
    "initially the distribution is flat , because there is no phase information .",
    "the initial controlled phase is therefore chosen to be random .",
    "then , after each detection , the probability distribution is updated using bayes theorem , @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes whether the detection is even or odd , @xmath48 is the vector of successive detection results , and @xmath49 is the vector of the corresponding controlled phases . since the probabilities are periodic with period @xmath50 , they can be expressed as a fourier series , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is complex , and depends on @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    before the first detection , eq .   contains only one term , @xmath55 .",
    "after each detection result given by the probabilities in eq .  , the fourier coefficients @xmath52 in eq .",
    "are updated using eq .  , which again uses eq .",
    "however , to exactly represent eq .   in terms of fourier coefficients ,",
    "an infinite sum over the legendre polynomial terms is needed in eq .  .",
    "in order to perform the numerical calculations , we truncated this infinite sum .",
    "it was found that the cut - off needed depended on @xmath3 ; the values used are given in table [ table : one ] .",

    "here we take the sharpness to be @xmath58 , which differs from the case in ref .",
    "@xcite where the sharpness is @xmath59 .",
    "we make this choice because the probability distribution for the parity detection results has a period of @xmath50 instead of @xmath60 .",
    "the explicit expression for the average sharpness is @xmath61 this expression corresponds to the average sharpness for the measurement results weighted by their probability of occurring . maximizing this expression yields the highest average accuracy of the phase estimates after the next detection @xcite .",
    "the integral over @xmath2 simply yields the coefficient @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , this integral may be obtained by summing the absolute value of @xmath62 for and after the next detection .",
    "no analytical formula exists for calculating the optimal @xmath56 , so it was determined numerically @xcite . at the end of each measurement record",
    ", the estimate is taken to be the argument of @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath63 .",
    "this estimate of the phase is optimal for a measure of the measurement accuracy based on @xmath64 @xcite , where @xmath65 is the value of an individual estimate .",
    "here we are using the mean - square error ( mse ) , for which this estimate is not exactly optimal .",
    "( the mse is an estimate of the error that is equal to the variance if the measurement is unbiased , and also appropriately penalises biased estimates . )",
    "however , this estimate is close to optimal for narrowly peaked distributions . in that case",
    ", the cosine function can be accurately approximated by expanding to second order , so @xmath66 therefore the estimate that maximizes @xmath64 approximately minimizes the mse @xmath67 .",
    "this estimate of the phase is also close to unbiased for narrowly peaked distributions .",
    "this is because @xmath68 .",
    "for narrowly peaked distributions , the exponential can be expanded to first order , giving @xmath69 , which implies that @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the cramr - rao bound should hold approximately .",
    "another feature of this estimate of the phase , is that together with the random initial controlled phase , it ensures that the measurement scheme is covariant .",
    "that is , the probability distribution for the error in the estimate is independent of the system phase . in order to fairly evaluate the overall performance of a measurement scheme , one should determine the mse averaged over the system phase .",
    "when the measurement scheme is covariant , this averaging is unnecessary , because the mse is independent of the system phase .    in order to estimate the performance of this adaptive scheme ,",
    "measurement records were generated numerically and the controlled phases @xmath56 were calculated . for a measurement record consisting of @xmath6 detections",
    ", we generated @xmath71 records to evaluate the mse of the estimates .",
