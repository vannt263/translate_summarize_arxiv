    "one of the main guiding principles in seeking an appropriate theory of formation of grains in metals and alloys during and after cold working processes producing severe plastic deformations has first been proposed by hansen and kuhlmann - wilsdorf @xcite in form of the so - called leds - hypothesis : the dislocation structures in the final state of deformation minimize the energy of crystals ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason why the formation of grains becomes energetically preferable at severe plastic deformations lies in the non - convexity of the energy of crystal in this range @xcite . within the conventional crystal plasticity considered in @xcite",
    "the minimization of such non - convex energy leads immediately to the infinitely fine lamellar structure with grain boundaries as sharp interfaces .",
    "however , as mentioned by kuhlmann - wilsdorf and hansen @xcite , typical grain boundaries , termed geometrically necessary boundaries , have as a rule a non - vanishing thickness and may contain a large number of dislocations and thus contradict the conventional crystal plasticity .",
    "the question then arrises in this connection : what kind of continuum model may resolve this conflict ?",
    "the present paper proposes a dislocation model of formation of grains within the continuum dislocation theory @xcite which predicts the existence of such geometrically necessary boundaries . by including the energy of dislocation network containing the gradient of the plastic slip into the energy functional we regularize the non - convex energy minimization problem .",
    "we illustrate the application of the theory on the example of single crystal deforming in single slip under a simple shear .",
    "we show that the geometrically necessary boundaries , in which the transition from one grain to the next occurs smoothly , have a small but finite thickness and contain a large number of dislocations .",
    "although the resultant burgers vector of dislocations in such grain boundary is non - zero , they do not produce long range stresses , and the lamellar structure of grains is in fact the low energy dislocations structure .",
    "we also compute the thickness of geometrically necessary boundaries and their energies as functions of the misorientation angles .",
    "based on these results we estimate also the number of grains in terms of the specimen sizes .",
    "we consider for simplicity an initially dislocation - free single crystal having only one active slip system . in this case",
    "the kinematic quantities characterizing its observable deformations are the placement field @xmath0 and the plastic slip field @xmath1 .",
    "the incompatible plastic deformation is given by @xmath2 with the pair of constant and mutually orthogonal unit lattice vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 denoting the slip direction and the normal to the slip planes .",
    "using the multiplicative resolution of the total compatible deformation gradient @xmath5 into the plastic and elastic part @xcite , we find the incompatible elastic deformation in the form @xmath6 the tensor of dislocation density measuring the incompatibility of @xmath7 reads ( see @xcite ) @xmath8 if , in addition , all dislocation lines are straight lines parallel to the unit vector @xmath9 , then the scalar dislocation density ( or the number of excess dislocations per unit area perpendicular to @xmath9 ) can be determined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the magnitude of burgers vector .    for crystals having as a rule small elastic strains we propose the free energy per unit volume of the undeformed configuration in the form",
    "@xmath12 here @xmath13 corresponds to the elastic strain tensor , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the lam constants , @xmath16 a material constant , and @xmath17 can be interpreted as the saturated dislocation density .",
    "the first two terms in represent energy of crystal due to the macroscopic elastic deformation .",
    "the last term describes energy of the dislocation network for moderate dislocation densities .",
    "note that for small or extremely large dislocation densities close to the saturated density the logarithmic energy proposed in @xcite is more appropriate .",
    "we deform this crystal occupying in the initial configuration some region @xmath18 of three - dimensional space by placing it in a displacement - controlled device such that , at the boundary @xmath19 , the conditions @xmath20 are specified , with @xmath21 being a given overall deformation . if the deformation process is isothermal , no body force acts on this crystal , and the resistance to the dislocation motion can be neglected , then the following variational principle turns out to be valid : the true placement vector @xmath22 and the true plastic slip @xmath23 in the _ final _ equilibrium state of deformation minimize the energy functional @xmath24=\\int_{\\mathcal{v}}w(\\mathbf{f},\\beta , \\nabla \\beta ) \\ , dx\\ ] ] among all _ continuously differentiable _",
    "fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfying constraints , where @xmath25 .",
    "we will see that , due to the non - convexity of the free energy density and the presence of @xmath26 in the energy functional via the energy of the dislocation network , the formation of grains with regular grain boundaries having a finite thickness is energetically preferable .",
    "consider now the special case of plane strain simple shear of the specimen in form of a cuboid of height @xmath27 , width @xmath28 , and depth @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , while @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath1 depend only on two cartesian coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 and satisfy at the side boundary the conditions @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the overall shear strain .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 , @xmath38 and all dislocation lines are parallel to the @xmath39-axis , so @xmath40 . if the deformations are uniform such that @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the constants , then the energy normalized by @xmath44 and minimized with respect to @xmath43 turns out to be non - convex for @xmath45 as shown in fig .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that such candidates for the minimizer satisfy the equations of equilibrium in each layer as well as the outer boundary conditions except at the side boundaries @xmath51 of the specimen . besides , the energy of such lamellar structure is equal to zero which is the minimal possible value . however",
    ", if the boundaries between layers are sharp interfaces , these candidates do not belong to the set of admissible fields of our original variational problem and due to the jumps of @xmath52 and @xmath43 on those interfaces , so they fail to be the energy minimizers of and .        to correct the behavior of those candidates for minimizers we assume now that the layers corresponding to the states a and b are separated by a thin layer of small thickness @xmath53 in which the placement and plastic slip change smoothly from state a to state b ( see fig .

    "the resolution of this conflict should be found in the discreteness of crystals that may accommodate only a large but finite natural number of dislocations .",
    "since the dislocation density is @xmath95 , the total number of dislocations in the boundary layer equals @xmath96 as the smallest number of dislocation is 1 , the smallest quantum of plastic slip leading to the recognizable change of @xmath97 must be @xmath98 .",
