    "supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite come with many promises to become the next step in the search for new physics .",
    "they offer a solution to the hierarchy problem , a candiate to dark matter and many new particles at the range of the energy of the lhc .",
    "now , with the data of the first run of the lhc we have new bounds for the susy observables which constraint the susy parameters .",
    "we study the impact of these bounds to the susy contribution to some of the sm well measured observables .",
    "in particular , we include on our analysis flavor violating ( fv ) contributions arising from the new susy particles .",
    "we work in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , with the additional assumption that susy is broken by universal soft terms at the grand unification scale ( gut ) . in this framework ,",
    "called constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , there is fv only in the squark sector .",
    "this arises due to the presence of the yukawa couplings in the rge s , such that the fv is only due the ckm matrix .",
    "hence , this is the minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) scenario @xcite .",
    "however , this is not enough to explain the experimental evidence for neutrino flavor oscillations . in order to account for those",
    ", we must enlarge the cmssm .",
    "this can achieved by augmenting the cmssm with a ",
    "see - saw  mechanism od type i. the resulting model , called \" cmssm - seesaw i  predicts also fv in the lepton sector ( lfv ) .",
    "we present in the next sections some results on fv predictions on the cmssm and their contribution to the evaluation of electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) , in particular @xmath1 and the effective weak leptonic mixing angle , @xmath2 .",
    "the effects on other observables like @xmath0  physics observables ( bpo ) , in particular @xmath3 , @xmath4  and @xmath5 , as well as the masses of the neutral and charged higgs bosons in the mssm where found to be small .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",

    "the mssm is defined by the superpotential : @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the chiral multiplet of a @xmath13 doublet lepton , @xmath14 a @xmath13 singlet charged lepton , @xmath15 and @xmath16 two higgs doublets with opposite hypercharge .",
    "similarly @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent chiral multiplets of quarks of a @xmath13 doublet and two singlets with different @xmath20 charges .",
    "three generations of leptons and quarks are assumed and thus the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 run over 1 to 3 .",
    "the symbol @xmath23 is an anti - symmetric tensor with @xmath24 .",
    "susy is  softly brooken \" by a scalar potential with bilinear and trilinear combinations of the superpartners . within the constrained mssm",
    "the soft susy - breaking parameters are assumed to be universal at the grand unification scale @xmath25 .",
    "all the scalars are assumed to have the same mass , @xmath7 , the trilinear soft tems are proportional to their respective yukawa couplings and fermionic partners of the gauge bosons have a common mass @xmath8 . since the soft terms are universal , at the gut scale , they are invariant under superfield rotations .",
    "hence , it is possible to work in the basis in which the yukawa couplings are @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that fv terms display an explicit dependence on the ckm matrix .",
    "the susy spectra have been generated with the code spheno 3.2.4  @xcite .",
    "all the susy masses and mixings are then given as a function of @xmath28 , @xmath8 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values ( see below ) .",
    "we require radiative symmetry breaking to fix @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the tree ",
    "level higgs potential .",
    "the non - diagonal entries in this @xmath33 general matrix for sfermions can be described in terms of a set of dimensionless parameters @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) where @xmath38 identifies the sfermion type , @xmath39 refer to the `` left- '' and `` right - handed '' susy partners of the corresponding fermionic degrees of freedom , and @xmath40 indexes run over the three generations .",
    "the soft sfermion mass matrices in terms of the @xmath34 are @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined in a similar way , while @xmath44 verifies : @xmath45 .",
    "the trilinear terms can be written as :    @xmath46 the matrix @xmath47 has a similar form .",
    "we found that the values of all the @xmath48 show a decoupling effect , as it is diplayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : delqll23 ] for the case of @xmath49 .",
    "however , for @xmath50 we found a non decoupling effect .",
    "the increase of this term with @xmath7 produces important contributions to the ewpo as we will see in the next section .",
    "the flavor violating parameters , generated from the rge runing , enter at one loop in the computation of the physical observables .",
    "numerically , the results have been obtained using the code feynhiggs  @xcite , which contains the complete set of one - loop corrections from ( flavor violating ) squark and slepton contributions as given is ref .",
    "@xcite .    in gev ( left ) and @xmath2 in the @xmath7@xmath8 plane for @xmath9 and @xmath10  gev in the cmssm.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    ewpo , which are known with a great accuracy , have the potential to allow a discrimination between quantum effects of the sm and susy models .",
    "examples are the @xmath51-boson mass @xmath1 and the @xmath52-boson observables , such as the effective leptonic weak mixing angle @xmath2 , whose present experimental uncertainties are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the experimental uncertanity will further be reduced to @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively in future linear colliders .    to show explicitely the contribution of the fv entries to the different observables , we compare the full contribution with the value obtained by setting all @xmath57 .",
    "the results for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the obtained values with all @xmath57 ) are displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : sq - delmw ] . we can observe a non - decoupling behavoir for the ewpo similar as the one observed in some of the @xmath62 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delqll23 ] .",
    "the fv contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be above the experimental uncertainty at some regions of the space of parameters .",
    "therefore , fv contributions can not be neglected in their evaluation .",
    "particularly , in view of a future improved experimental accuracies .    the fv contribution to other observables turn out to be small , the full fv computation does not lead to significant differences respect the common approach of setting all the @xmath57 . in the case of the lightest mssm higgs boson ,",
    "the uncertainties arising from the theoretical computation are larger than the exprimental precision of the higgs mass discovered at the lhc . even though , we find that the values for @xmath63 that enter in the theoretical prediction are far below the experimental precision .",
    "similarly , we found that for bpo the approach of taking @xmath57 is justified .",
    "we studied the impact of including mfv entries on the sfermion mass matrices as they arise naturally on the cmssm when the ckm matrix is included in the rge s .",
    "after a carefull evaluation of several precission observables , we conclude that the effect is not very significant for bpo and higgs boson masses .",
    "however , ewpo receive contributions that show a non - decoupling behavoir as the values of the susy spectrum increases . for instance",
    ", those effects can be larger than the current experimental accuracy in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "taking those effects correctly into account places new upper bounds on @xmath7 that are neglected in recent phenomenological analyses .",
    "further applications to fv higgs decays can be found in ref .",
