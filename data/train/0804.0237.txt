    "the first strong candidate and certain substellar objects identified outside the solar system were all discovered orbiting evolved degenerate stars : the probable brown dwarf companion to the white dwarf gd 165 @xcite , and the planetary system orbiting the pulsar psr 1257@xmath712 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the first directly detected , unambiguous substellar and planetary mass objects were imaged as wide companions orbiting low luminosity primaries : the brown dwarf secondary to the m dwarf gl 229 @xcite , and the planetary mass secondary to the young brown dwarf commonly known as 2m1207 @xcite .",
    "historically , as well as astrophysically , these properties provide a clear advantage over other types of primaries in the quest to directly detect radiation from bound substellar objects of the lowest mass , such as planets .",
    "observations indicate that bound substellar objects and planetary system components survive post - main sequence evolution .",
    "first , there now exist roughly one dozen first ascent giant stars known to harbor substellar and planetary companions @xcite .",
    "second , there are at least 3 white dwarfs which have close , unaltered and unevolved substellar companions @xcite .",
    "third , there are at least 10 white dwarfs with infrared excess due to debris disks which indicate a growing probability of orbiting rocky planetesimals @xcite .",
    "these cool white dwarfs with warm orbiting dust also display anomalous photospheric metals which are almost certainly accreted from their circumstellar material .",
    "the origin of the orbiting material and the dynamical interactions necessary to bring it close enough to the star to be accreted , are consistent with remnant planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the earth - size radii and consequent low luminosities typical of white dwarfs are clear advantages when searching for light emitted from cold jupiter - size planets and brown dwarfs .",
    "prior to the launch of _ spitzer _ , generally speaking , only m and l dwarf companions could be detected directly as excess infrared emission from white dwarfs @xcite . as a benchmark ,",
    "a typical 10000 k degenerate and an l5 dwarf are about equally luminous at @xmath8-band @xcite , while ground - based observations of white dwarfs at longer wavelengths ( where the contrast for cooler companions would improve ) are prohibited by overwhelming sky brightness @xcite .",
    "owing to the capabilities of _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , a cycle 1 irac @xcite program was undertaken to photometrically search for massive planets and cold substellar companions to relatively young and old white dwarfs , respectively .",
    "specifically , the target sample includes white dwarfs in the hyades and pleiades , high mass field white dwarfs , and metal - rich field white dwarfs .",
    "farihi , zuckerman , & becklin ( 2008 ; paper i ) describe photometry for all the older ( metal - rich ) degenerate targets , while this paper presents a synopsis of the irac results for the younger ( open cluster and high mass ) degenerates , and upper mass limits for unresolved companions to all the cycle 1 targets .",
    "while highly evolved , white dwarfs are not necessarily old . this fact is exemplified by the nearest and brightest degenerate star in the sky , sirius b , with a mass of @xmath9 @xmath3 and a total age of @xmath10 myr @xcite . for stars which evolved essentially as single objects , there is a correlation between main sequence progenitor mass and white dwarf mass , derived primarily from studies of open clusters @xcite .",
    "this initial - to - final mass relation yields an estimate of the total age for any particular white dwarf provided its mass and cooling age are accurately known . for white dwarf masses below 0.6 @xmath3 ,",
    "the initial - to - final mass relation is quite steep and small errors in degenerate mass can lead to large errors in main sequence lifetime @xcite .",
    "the hyades and pleiades are relatively young and nearby open clusters ; the former at @xmath11 pc and @xmath12 myr @xcite , and the latter at @xmath13 myr and @xmath14 pc @xcite .",
    "classically , the only white dwarf pleiad is eg 25 ( lb 1497 ) , but recently the possibility has been raised that the massive white dwarfs gd 50 and pg 0136@xmath7251 may have originated in the same region which gave rise to the cluster @xcite .",
    "the latter stars are considered in the following section , and only eg 25 is listed among cluster targets .",
    "table [ tbl1 ] lists all observed open cluster white dwarfs , including the seven classical single white dwarf hyads and eg 265 ( v411 @xmath15 ) , which is either a proper cluster member or part of the hyades supercluster @xcite .",
    "excluded are the white dwarf hyads in binary systems ; v471 @xmath15 and hz 9 .",
    "the open cluster targets come from this study ( _ spitzer _ program 3549 ; pi becklin ) , with the exception of hyades targets eg 39 and eg 42 , which were extracted from the _ spitzer _ archive ( program 2313 ; pi kuchner ) .      as with sirius b and the white dwarf pleiad",
    ", a white dwarf mass near 1.0 @xmath3 implies a short main sequence lifetime for unadulterated single star evolution , regardless of association .",
    "more specifically , were these young white dwarfs identical in mass ( depending on the reference , their masses differ by no more than 10% ; @xcite ) , their total age difference can be estimated from the difference in their effective temperatures ; @xmath16 k for sirius b , and @xmath17 k for eg 25 .",
    "for these temperatures , log @xmath18 ( very nearly 1.0 @xmath3 ) hydrogen atmosphere models predict cooling ages of 130 and 60 myr respectively , which by itself would account for 60% of their total age difference @xcite . in reality",
    "the total difference in their ages is due both to differential cooling and unequal main sequence progenitor lifetimes .",
    "any hot , high mass white dwarf which evolved as a single star will be similarly young , or even younger for higher temperatures or masses . in this paper",
    ", it is assumed that all high mass white dwarfs are descended from single main sequence star progenitors of intermediate mass , but this may not be the case .",
    "there appears to be indirect evidence in favor of , as well as against , the existence of high mass white dwarfs resulting from mergers , but no direct evidence exists @xcite .",
    "ten hot and massive white dwarf targets come from this study ( _ spitzer _ program 3549 ; pi becklin ) and one dozen similar targets were extracted from the _ spitzer _ archive ( program 3309 ; pi hansen ) .",
    "table [ tbl2 ] lists the 22 hot field white dwarfs with masses @xmath19 @xmath3 selected for study .",
    "included in the sample are metal - rich white dwarfs from paper i ( _ spitzer _ program 3548 ; pi zuckerman ) with the addition of vma 2 , which was extracted from the _ spitzer _ archive ( program 33 ; pi fazio ) .",
    "these targets are relatively old , with total ages between @xmath20 gyr and are listed in table [ tbl3 ] for completeness , although their irac fluxes are previously published in paper i with the exception of vma 2 .",
    "for white dwarf targets in programs 3548 and 3549 , the details of the irac observing strategy , data reduction and analysis are described in full detail in paper i. in these programs a total exposure time of 600 s was utilized for each target in all bandpasses . for white dwarf targets extracted from the _ spitzer _ archive ,",
    "the exposure times were shorter and occasionally in only 2 bandpasses ( see @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , all targets were unambiguously detected at 4.5 @xmath1 m , the wavelength which places the best constraints on spatially unresolved cold substellar and massive planetary companions , according to models for the appropriate range of ages and masses @xcite .",
    "paper i contains a detailed discussion regarding the consistency of measured irac fluxes of white dwarfs compared to model predictions and concludes the photometric accuracy is well described as 5% .",
    "also described there is a conservative approach to estimating the signal - to - noise of irac detections in the presence of possible confusion and spatially varying background . in paper",
    "i , all targets were detected at all wavelengths , which is not the case here .    to create upper limits for nondetections ,",
    "aperture photometry was performed as described in paper i at the nominal location of the white dwarf , derived from one or more irac channels in which the source was positively detected . utilizing the smallest radius ( @xmath21 pixels ) for which there are published aperture corrections , the flux in this aperture",
    "was compared to the per pixel sky noise multiplied by the area of the aperture , and the larger of these values was taken to be the upper limit , after an appropriate aperture correction . in nearly all cases ,",
    "the larger value was given by the additive noise in the aperture , but there were a few cases in which there was flux measured above this level .",
    "in these cases , it appeared possible or likely that the measured flux originated from background sources as evidenced by pixel shifts in the centroid of the source flux compared to the other irac channels , or sources which were apparently extended .",
    "it is noteworthy that the photometric errors used here , as well as the derived upper limits for nondetections , are somewhat larger than those published in @xcite and @xcite for the same observations . in some cases where",
    "white dwarf flux is reported by those authors , table [ tbl4 ] indicates only an upper limit for the reasons stated at the end of the previous paragraph .",
    "irac fluxes and upper limits for 32 of 48 studied stars ( excepting those previously published in paper i ) are listed in table [ tbl4 ] and plotted in figures [ fig1][fig8 ] .",
    "to infer companion mass limits using substellar cooling models , each white dwarf target requires an assessment of its total age since formation as a main sequence star .",
    "substellar companions which form in a binary will be truly coeval , while massive planets are thought to form within 10 myr of their main sequence hosts . for the open cluster",
    "white dwarfs , their total age is the cluster age , while for field white dwarfs the following methods are used to estimate their ages .    first , any field white dwarf with a mass and effective temperature similar to or higher than the pleiad eg 25 is assumed to be of similar age , roughly 0.1 gyr .",
    "there are sufficient uncertainties in both the masses and temperatures of these stars , as evidenced by the @xmath22% variation among parameters cited in the literature for the same objects ( see table [ tbl2 ] for a list of references ) which translates into errors in cooling ages on the order of @xmath22 myr .",
    "fortunately , this type of error should be offset when assessing a total age because higher mass white dwarfs cool more slowly ( smaller surface area ) yet have shorter inferred main sequence lifetimes than their less massive counterparts .",
    "for the high mass field stars considered here , the modest errors in cooling age and inferred main sequence lifetime , which result from uncertainties in white dwarf parameters , are comparable in magnitude and therefore tend to cancel out .",
    "given these uncertainties for the hot and massive field white dwarfs , it seems prudent to assign a 20% uncertainty in their total ages , or @xmath23 gyr .",
    "second , all cooler and less massive ( i.e. older ) field degenerates have their total ages assessed following the procedure employed originally by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "this latter method utilizes the initial - to - final mass to relation to obtain a main sequence mass from the current , known white dwarf mass . a main sequence lifetime",
    "is then assigned based on the inferred main sequence mass , and this is added to the white dwarf cooling lifetime to obtain an approximate total age    @xmath24    cooling ages come from models of p. bergeron ( 2002 , private communication ; @xcite ) , while main sequence lifetimes were calculcated using the formulae of @xcite .",
    "tables [ tbl5 ] and [ tbl6 ] list the relevant ages for all targets together with upper mass limits for substellar companions determined as described below .",
    "it should be stated that this general method is the best available to estimate the total age of white dwarfs not belonging to open clusters or multiple systems from which another age constraint might be gleaned .",
    "however , there are several sources of uncertainty in the estimation of total ages , including but not limited to : the slope of the initial - to - final mass relation , assumed main sequence lifetimes , and white dwarf model uncertainties ; specifically , spectroscopic parameter fits and cooling ages @xcite . owing to these facts ,",
    "the uncertainty in the total ages of older field white dwarfs is taken to be 25% .",
    "all white dwarfs in tables [ tbl1][tbl3 ] have measured irac fluxes at 4.5 @xmath1 m , where cold ( @xmath25 k ) substellar objects are predicted to be brightest @xcite .",
    "this bandpass is best for placing limits on any spatially unresolved substellar companions .",
    "the flux errors in table [ tbl4 ] are @xmath26 values , but for reasons discussed in paper i , and to be conservative , an unambiguous detection of excess at this wavelength is defined here as @xmath27 above the expected white dwarf flux . by demanding this level of excess , blackbody models will suffice to predict the expected 4.5 @xmath1 m photospheric flux of the white dwarf targets ( paper i ) . the absolute magnitude corresponding to the minimally reliable excess flux from each white dwarf target ,",
    "is then given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the total flux error in jy at 4.5 @xmath1 m from table [ tbl4 ] , @xmath30 is the distance to the white dwarf in pc , and @xmath31 jy @xcite .",
    "substellar cooling models updated to include fluxes in the irac bandpasses were used to transform the expected flux into a mass for a given age ( i. baraffe 2007 , private communication ; @xcite ) .",
    "some representative , model predicted values for @xmath32 at the ages of interest are given in table [ tbl7 ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that this analysis rules out unresolved sub - t dwarf companions at 25 white dwarfs in table [ tbl5 ] ; the known t dwarf sequence ends near @xmath33 mag and t8 @xcite , and limits at these stars reach 13.6 @xmath34 15.2 mag ( typically @xmath35 mag ) .",
    "additionally , any spatially resolved point sources detected within several arcseconds of the white dwarf were photometrically examined for the possibility of companionship via their irac colors and any available ground - based photometric or astrometric data .",
    "owing to the higher sensitivity of the 2 short irac wavelengths , some resolved substellar objects may not be detected at the 2 long irac wavelengths , resulting in a potential ambiguity for some visual companions .",
    "generally speaking , no candidate companions were identified in this manner , but a few possibilties are discussed in  5.7 .      in order to detect t and sub - t dwarfs as spatially resolved companions , and to differentiate such objects from background point - like sources , they must be reliably detected at all 4 irac wavelengths .",
    "the 2 long wavelength irac channels in particular , together with the 2 short wavelength channels , provide unique information which should eliminate the color degeneracy between cool brown dwarfs and red extragalactic ( point - like ) sources in the near - infrared and short wavelength irac channels alone @xcite .",
    "this fact appreciably limits any wide field irac search for t dwarf companions due to the lower sensitivity of the long wavelength irac channels @xcite , as detailed below .",
    "there are 7 white dwarfs from table [ tbl3 ] which met the necessary criteria for such a search : 1 ) irac imaging of their surrounding fields in all 4 channels and ; 2 ) a distance within approximately 20 pc .",
    "the entire known t dwarf sequence ( down to t8 ) should be detected at all 4 wavelengths at these distances @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the number of detected sources in each irac channel , as a function of magnitude , in the full irac fields of the 16 white dwarfs from paper i which shared 600 s integration times per filter , and identical 20-point dithering patterns .",
    "these sources were successfully detected and extracted photometrically by the iraf tasks daofind and daophot .",
    "based on the number of detections per magnitude bin ( disregarding any trends in the number of source counts as a function of wavelength ) , it is clear that the 7.9 @xmath1 m channel would limit any 4 channel irac survey for objects whose spectral energy distributions are not rising towards longer wavelengths .",
    "there exist a total of 58 white dwarfs which have been observed with irac at 7.9 @xmath1 m utilizing a common experimental design ; 22 targets from the present work , 16 white dwarfs from paper i , and 10 degenerates from @xcite .",
    "this white dwarf dataset allows an empirical assessment of the photometric sensitivity at this longest wavelength , and contains 35 unambiguous detections in that channel , with point sources as faint as 0.06 mjy reliably detected in all backgrounds .",
    "this finding is consistent with : 1 ) the published sensitivities for irac @xcite ; 2 ) calculations by the sensitivity performance estimation tool ; and 3 ) the number of sources detected as a function of magnitude in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "therefore at @xmath36 mag , or 0.064 mjy , point sources should be well detected regardless of background .",
    "the t dwarf sequence down to spectral type t8 ends at @xmath37 mag @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath38 mag at a distance of 20 pc and thus any widely separated t dwarf companions to the @xmath39 pc targets should be readily detected in this channel .",
    "similar calculations in the other 3 irac channels estimate that a t8 dwarf should be correspondingly well detected out to ; 20 pc at 5.7 @xmath1 m , 60 pc at 3.6 @xmath1 m , and 100 pc at 4.5 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "for the white dwarf targets closer than 20 pc , the irac observations should be sensitive to small range of substellar companions with @xmath40 mag , and potentially of a later spectral type than t.    owing to the nature of the dithering pattern , a further assessment must be made in regards to the effective field of view for the depth described above . for all but vma 2 , the medium sized cycling pattern was used , which should result in an effective coverage equal to the irac field of view minus about 25 pixels at each edge , or approximately @xmath41 , consistent with the analyzed images . for vma 2 ,",
    "the effective field of view is about 12 pixels larger at each edge , or approximately @xmath42 , and the sensitivity was 0.75 mag less at each channel owing to a 150 s total integration time .",
    "for each white dwarf searched for wide t and sub - t dwarf companions , all 4 irac filter images were aligned and combined to create a single master coordinate image .",
    "the iraf task daofind was executed on this master irac image to select point sources with counts at or above @xmath27 and the resulting coordinate list was then fed into daophot for each filter image in order to perform automated point spread function fitting photometry .",
    "template point spread functions were created by running daophot on irac images of the galactic component of the _ spitzer _ galactic first look survey to select approximately half to one dozen bright , unsaturated point sources in each filter .",
    "the magnitudes of these selected template soures were calculated by creating zero points which included the zero magnitude fluxes for irac , multiplication by the appropriate unit area on the array , and the necessary conversion of units .",
    "if the standard @xmath43 pixel radius aperture is used for photometry , these zero points are ( 17.30 , 16.81 , 16.33 , 15.69 ) mag at ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.7 , 7.9 ) @xmath1 m .",
    "the extracted sources in each filter were cross - correlated using the master coordinate list , and 2 color - color diagrams were generated from the results ; @xmath44 versus @xmath45 , and @xmath44 versus @xmath46 . in these planes , t and sub - t dwarf candidates were selected by demanding an object meet 3 criteria suggested by the irac colors presented in @xcite ; @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , with error bars ignored in the first cut .",
    "all objects thus selected were examined individually ; their images inspected and photometric data further evaluated .",
    "although the mid - infrared colors of sub - t type objects are somewhat uncertain , model predictions yield colors which fit with the selection criteria above ( d. saumon 2006 , private communication ) . unfortunately , the earliest t dwarfs do not stand out strongly in irac color - color diagrams , and require near - infrared photometry to be clearly distinguished @xcite .",
    "no candidates which met all the criteria and passed critical examination were found in the irac fields of the 7 white dwarfs within @xmath50 pc . while testing the color - color selection and extraction algorithm , the procedure was conducted at all 17 metal - rich white dwarfs in table [ tbl3 ] . a typical detection which met the color criteria had one or more of the following problems : 1 ) large photometric errors ; 2 ) a location near the noisy edge of the image ; 3 ) probable confusion with another source ; 4 ) association with a known image artifact ; 5 ) a substantially discrepant color - magnitude at the expected distance .",
    "less often a detection would be a very red , unresolved extragalactic source whose nature was confirmed via existing optical astrometric and photometric catalogs .",
    "table [ tbl6 ] lists the resulting upper limits on substellar mass companions achieved using this method , calculated by transforming @xmath36 mag to the expected @xmath51 at the target distance , then using substellar cooling models to obtain a mass from this flux at the appropriate total age ( i. baraffe 2007 , private communication ; @xcite ) .    to test the selection and extraction algorithm , the irac fields of 3 t dwarfs were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ archive ( program 35 ; pi fazio ) and the procedure was run on images containing objects with spectral types t2.0 , t5.0 , and t8.0 @xcite .",
    "all 3 objects were selected correctly by the color - color cuts , and with modest photometric error bars indicating genuine detections .",
    "there is a non - zero probability that a bona fide cold brown dwarf companion escaped detection among our white dwarf target fields , despite the ability of daophot to spatially and photometrically deconvolve overlapping point sources .",
    "based on the detection logs and the statistics from figure [ fig9 ] , in the two short wavelength irac filter images there were roughly 1000 sources per field with brightnesses greater than the completeness limit in those bandpasses .",
    "taking a worst case scenario where all these sources represent potential spoilers yields a 2% probability of chance alignment within the relatively large , reduced image field of view .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] plots color - magnitude diagrams for all detected point - like sources in the fields of the 6 hyades white dwarfs observed in both of the short wavelength irac channels .",
    "included in the plot is the expected t dwarf sequence ( t1@xmath52t8 ; @xcite ) at the 46 pc distance to the open cluster .",
    "the cooler part of the t dwarf sequence appears to standout from most field objects .",
    "all sources with @xmath53 were investigated individually , revealing a few extragalactic sources , spurious detections near bright stars or the edge of the mosaic , and sources with large photometric errors .",
    "no reliable candidates near the t dwarf sequence were identified . since",
    "t and sub - t dwarfs should not be detected at the distance to the hyades in the 2 long wavelength irac channels , this limits what can be done with single epoch irac data to constrain wide , methane - bearing substellar companions . moreover , because very cool brown dwarfs will have @xmath54 @xcite , they should not be detected in 2mass , as any such companions in the hyades would have @xmath55 mag .",
    "therefore , further analysis of these datasets can only be be achieved with deep near - infrared imaging from the ground or proper motion analysis with a second epoch irac observation .",
    "clearly , none of the 32 stars in figures [ fig1][fig8 ] display reliably measured photometric excess at 4.5 @xmath1 m . when combined with similar results for the white dwarfs analyzed in paper i",
    ", there are a total of 47 observed degenerates which reveal no evidence for unresolved , cold brown dwarf or massive planetary companions .",
    "this is a striking result , especially considering the large number of relatively young white dwarfs where massive planets would be detectable .",
    "there are 34 white dwarfs for which the irac 4.5 @xmath1 m observations were sensitive to unresolved planetary mass companions in the range @xmath56 @xmath5 , and 10 white dwarfs for which the data were sensitive to brown dwarf companions in the range @xmath57 @xmath5 , according to substellar cooling models used here ( i. baraffe 2007 , private communication ; @xcite ) .",
    "the aperture photometry and image analysis places limits on the presence of unresolved or partially resolved companions out to approximately 5 pixels or @xmath58 , the largest aperture used for photometry ( paper i ) .",
    "this angle on the sky corresponds to a several hundred au region around the target white dwarfs , which lie at typical distances in the range @xmath59 pc .",
    "however , any planets which formed in the @xmath4 au range during the main sequence phase , should now be located further out due to orbital expansion via mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch @xcite , yet still within a region to which the irac photometry is sensitive . while a typical expansion factor ( equal to the ratio of the main sequence progenitor mass to the white dwarf mass ) is @xmath60 for f - type stars , the massive young degenerates studied here are likely to produce much larger increases , up to a factor of 6 or so .",
    "tidal interactions should be relatively strong for massive planets orbiting intermediate mass stars , whose radii can become as large as several au at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "for example , a 5 @xmath3 main sequence star should grow to a maximum radius near 5 au @xcite , directly engulfing any planets in that range . using equation 6 of @xcite for such a star , and assuming a convective envelope mass near 3 @xmath3 , a 10 @xmath5 planet at 10 au should tidally decay within the 1 myr lifetime of its asymptotic giant branch host @xcite .",
    "although this calculation is likely oversimplified , it is instructive ; eschewing direct engulfment is not sufficient for a planet to survive the post - main sequence .",
    "rather , the more massive the planet , the more it will induce tides in the giant star and the more likely it will experience orbital decay and be destroyed @xcite .",
    "one competing factor is the fact that by the time an asymptotic giant has reached it maximum radius there has been significant mass lost and the orbits of any planets should already have expanded commensurately .",
    "however , a complete , time - dependent treatment of these competing forces ",
    "orbital expansion due to mass loss versus orbital decay due to tidal forces  on planets during the asymptotic giant branch has not been carried out .",
    "such a study would be highly valuable but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "recent work indicates a substantial percentage of substellar , radial velocity companions to first ascent giant stars are potentially or certainly above the deuterium burning minimum mass .",
    "presently 4 of 13 or 31% of known substellar companions to giant stars have masses above 13 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "two items of interest for white dwarf planetary system studies emerge from these results at giant stars .",
    "first , the @xmath61 distribution of close substellar companions to intermediate mass , evolved stars is markedly different than for solar - type main sequence stars .",
    "second is the fact that all 4 brown dwarf hosting giants have 2 @xmath62 @xmath3 , and are thus related to the population of white dwarfs studied in this paper .    with orbital semimajor axes 0.5 au @xmath63 au @xcite , all of the known substellar radial velocity companions to first ascent giant stars risk destruction during the ensuing asymptotic giant phase .",
    "however , the most apparently brown dwarf - like companions have @xmath64 @xmath5 @xcite ; potentially massive enough to eject the giant stellar envelope as have the @xmath65 @xmath5 substellar companions to the white dwarfs wd 0137@xmath52049 and gd1400 @xcite ) . the close , @xmath66 hr substellar companion to wd 0137@xmath52049 is thought to have ejected the dense first ascent giant envelope of its host , as evidence by the fact the white dwarf is a low mass , helium core degenerate .",
    "this is not the case for gd 1400b , whose degenerate host is a typical , carbon - oxygen core white dwarf , but its @xmath67 hr period ( burleigh et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) indicates likely prior orbital decay due to the ejection of the asymptotic giant envelope . by inference , both these substellar survivors would have originally orbited within roughly 1 au of their host intermediate mass stellar progenitors .",
    "the results of this irac white dwarf study may imply that close massive planetary and brown dwarf companions to intermediate mass stars do not typically survive the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "robust statistics are not yet available , but @xcite estimate at least 3% of stars with @xmath68 @xmath3 mass stars host @xmath69 @xmath5 companions , and as discussed in  5.2 , about @xmath70 of these are brown dwarfs ( according to the iau definition ) .",
    "hence , a reasonably optimistic expectation for an irac search of 46 white dwarfs would be 1 or 2 detections .",
    "this negative result suggests the possibility that a higher ( substellar ) companion mass is required to survive the entire post - main sequence  specifically the asymptotic giant phase  at orbital separations of a few to several au .",
    "however , recent evidence has suggested a mechanism which may allow planets to survive within the inner regions through both giant phases ; sacrifice of the innermost components .",
    "analogous to the formation of several types of post - main sequence binaries , substellar companions can dynamically eject the ( first or second phase ) giant envelope @xcite , thereby shielding any remaining components in a planetary system . this process ",
    "common envelope evolution  is responsible for the close orbits of numerous low mass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "essentially , unstable mass transfer from the giant results in a frictional exchange of orbital energy between the secondary and the envelope material , resulting in an orbit decrease and an efficient envelope ejection @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 @xmath5 , @xmath72 au planet recently detected at the sdb star v391 pegasi @xcite has survived a first ascent giant phase involving significant mass loss , possibly due to such an interaction @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath73 @xmath5 , @xmath74 au planet candidate at the pulsating white dwarf gd 66 @xcite , may owe its inner region survival to the sacrfice of closer planets .    while intermediate separation planets may have indeterminate fates , any massive planets originally orbiting at @xmath75 au ,",
    "should now be located at tens to hundreds of au in the white dwarf phase , having essentially eluded any substantial post - main sequence interaction with their host star @xcite .",
    "the results of this irac search imply that massive , @xmath76 @xmath5 planets and brown dwarfs form rarely ( @xmath77% ) at these wide separations .",
    "the massive planet recently found at the hyades giant @xmath78 tauri @xcite is very interesting in light of the 7 classical white dwarf hyads surveyed with irac  would such an planet have been detected if it persisted into the white dwarf evolutionary phase ?",

    "if the minimal sensitivity achieved here for these 46 targets is matched by similar irac 4.5 @xmath1 m results for 124 nearby white dwarfs @xcite , this fraction could be smaller than 0.6% , and consistent with previous white dwarf studies which were sensitive to somewhat higher temperatures and masses ( l dwarfs ; @xcite ) .",

    "<S> in particular , these targets include : 7 hyads and 4 field white dwarfs of similar age ; 1 pleiad and 19 field white dwarfs of similar age ; van maanen 2 and 16 similarly metal - rich white dwarfs with ages between 1 and 7 gyr .    </S>",
