    "<S> we have studied the magnetotransport of conical and disk - shaped nanocarbon particles in magnetic fields @xmath0 at temperatures @xmath1 to characterize electron scattering in a three dimensional disordered material of multilayered quasi 2d and 3d carbon nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the microstructure of the particles was modified by graphitization at temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find clear correlations between the microstructure as seen in transmission electron microscopy and the magnetotransport properties of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoresistance measurements showed a metallic nature of samples and positive magnetoconductance which is a signature of weak localization in disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetoconductance at low temperatures resembles quantum transport in single - layer graphene despite the fact that the samples are macroscopic and three dimensional , consisting of stacked and layered particles , which are randomly oriented in the bulk sample . </S>",
    "<S> this graphene - like behaviour is attributed to the very weak interlayer coupling between the graphene layers . </S>"
