    "investigations of the structure and physical properties of liquid crystals have greatly increased in the last decades and are now an integral part of solid - state physics .",
    "certain organic materials do not show a single transition from solid to liquid , but rather a cascade of transitions involving new phases .",
    "the mechanical properties and the symmetry properties of these phases are intermediate between those of a liquid and those of a crystal @xcite .    depending upon the nature of the building blocks and upon external parameters ( temperature , solvents , etc . ) a wide variety of phenomena and transitions amongst liquid crystals are observed . to generate",
    "a liquid crystal one must use anisotropic objects , like elongated molecules .",
    "several ways are known to achieve this : with small molecules ; with long helical rods that either occur in nature or can be made artificially ; with polymers ; with more complex structure units like the capside of a virus @xcite that are associated structures of molecules and ions ; likewise , with even more complex structure units , like amoeboid cells which are complex structures far from thermodynamic equilibrium and act as a machine @xcite . here , the orientational elastic properties of liquid crystal formed by migrating and living cells are investigated .",
    "thermotropic nematic liquid crystals can be formed by small elongated molecules like p - azoxyanisole ( paa ) or n-(p - methoxybenzylidene)-p - butylaniline ( mbba ) which can be regarded as rigid rods ( @xmath0 nm length and @xmath1 nm width ) . at low temperature one",
    "observes a crystalline phase .",
    "heating up the sample , a transition to a nematic phase is observed . with further heating the transition to an isotropic liquid is observed .",
    "lyotropic nematic liquid crystal can be formed by long elongated molecules in suitable solvents .",
    "the anisotropic building blocks can have a rod - like conformation like ( i ) synthetic polypeptides ( @xmath2 length and @xmath3 nm width ) and ( ii ) tobacco mosaic virus ( @xmath4 nm length and @xmath5 nm width ) . at low concentration one",
    "observes an isotropic liquid but a transition to a nematic phase is observed by increasing the concentration of the elongated building blocks .",
    "the fundamental property of a nematic liquid crystal , which makes it different from an isotropic liquid and similar to a solid , is the presence of an orientational degree of freedom which is characterized by a macroscopic spatial ordering of the long axis of molecules .",
    "the statistical mechanics for predicting the macroscopic spatial ordering is difficult but can be approximated by applying mean - field calculations .",
    "( i ) the onsager approach starts with anisotropic steric repulsion .",
    "the free energy is minimum for oriented rods ( width @xmath6 length ) : they show an orientational order of a nematic phase at high rod density .",
    "but , at low rod density , the suspension is an isotropic liquid , as expected .",
    "( ii ) the maier - saupe theory approaches the intermolecular interactions by a mean - field which is proportional to the order parameter of the nematic phase .",
    "the minimum of the free enthalpy yields the equilibrium state . at high temperature an isotropic liquid without orientational order is predicted , but a nematic liquid crystal with orientational order can occur at low temperatures .",
    "the above mentioned nematic liquid crystals are described by equilibrium thermodynamic .",
    "this holds true even for tobacco mosaic virus since only the anisotropic shape of the viruses is considered .",
    "the intracellular metabolism can be neglected since the virus does not have the ability of self - motion .",
    "thus , the thermal motion is the stochastic source for the molecular dynamics .",
    "however , liquid crystal phases can also be formed if the stochastic source is created by energy consuming processes . a typical example",
    "are migrating biological cells like white blood cells . in the absence of a directing extracellular signal ,",
    "the single cells perform a random walk due to the existence of stochastic processes in the intracellular signal transduction chain .",
    "the migrating cells can form liquid crystal phases if each cell transmits extracellular signals that are received by other cells .",
    "the symmetry of the cell - cell interaction is important for the formed type of liquid crystal phase :    \\(i ) a polar nematic liquid crystal is expected if the cell - cell interaction is polar .",
    "this means that one cell transmits a signal which attracts another cell .",
    "the cellular response is directed migration .",
    "for example : ( a ) single slime mould cells migrate as amoeboid cells on a surface and search for bacteria as food . in the case of low bacteria concentration , the intracellular metabolism of the slime mould cells",
    "alters in such a way that cyclic amp is emitted as an extracellular signal .",
    "other slime mould cells can receive this chemical signal and react accordingly to the received signal with directed migration . at high enough cell density ,",
    "the cells form a cluster where each cell tries to move towards the center of the cluster @xcite .",
    "( b ) a similar process is observed with migrating white blood cells @xcite .",
    "if human leukocytes ( granulocytes ) are expose to blood plasma they then migrate as single amoeboid cells on a surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster1]a .",
    "but if the calcium concentration is lowered , e.g. by adding the chelator edta ( ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid , @xmath7 ) or egta ( ethyleneglycol-(aminoethyl ether ) tetraacedic acid , @xmath8 ) to the plasma , then the migrating granulocytes attract each other and form a cluster , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster1]b .",
    "the emitted molecules ( chemical signal ) is still unknown .",
    "the process is reversible since the clusters disappear if the calcium concentration is increased . in both examples , the cells in a cluster form a polar nematic liquid crystal because ( i ) there is order in the cell orientation , @xmath9 , induced by the directed migration and ( ii ) no order in the center of mass of the cells .",
    "the angle , @xmath10 , is the difference between the actual migration direction and the direction towards the center of the cluster .",
    "the cells in the cluster of fig .",
    "[ cluster1]b have a polar order of 0.82 .",
    "a singularity in the cell orientation is expected in the center of the cluster .",
    "a common observation is that the cell in the center has a spherical shape and the surrounding cells have a polar shape .",
    "human monocytes ( another type of leukocytes ) are immobile on a glass surface .",
    "if a mixture of granulocytes and monocytes is investigated , the immobile monocytes act as nucleation center as shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster1]b .",
    "the polar nematic liquid crystal formed by living and migrating cells is a system far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "one can ask which temperature corresponds to the random movement of the cells ?",
    "this question can be answered by using the einstein relation which connects the random movement of an inert particle described by the diffusion coefficient d , the mobility r and the thermal energy @xmath11 t : @xmath12 .",
    "the mobility of a spherical particle with radius r in a viscous medium with viscosity @xmath13 is given by stokes : @xmath14 .",
    "the random movement of a migration granulocyte can be quantified by measuring the mean - squared displacement as a function of time .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath15 , is one fitting parameter ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the calculated temperature for an inert particle which has the value of the diffusion coefficient of the migrating cells , is very high @xmath17 k ( @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) an apolar nematic liquid crystal is expected if the cell - cell interaction is apolar .",
    "this means that one cell can influence the orientation of another cell .",
    "the cellular response is such that the cells like to be parallel .",
    "for example , human melanocytes are elongated cells which distribute with their dendrites the pigment melanin in the skin .",
    "although the involved chemical signal is unknown there exists an attractive cell - cell interaction because the cell body of one cell attracts another cell body .",
    "there also exists a repulsive cell - cell interaction since the dendrites avoid contact with each other .",
    "the elongated cells try to be parallel oriented to each other and form at high cell density a nematic liquid crystal . at low cell density",
    "the cells form cluster with oriented cells as shown in fig .",
    "[ melano21]a , however , with increasing cell concentration the cells form a nematic liquid crystal . fig .",

    "this observation is not restricted to melanocytes .",
    "other cell types like fibroblasts , osteoblasts , adipocytes etc .",
    "orient in the same way so that , in the mean , the cells are parallel to each other .",
    "the cells form an apolar nematic liquid crystal because there is no order in the center of mass of the cells but order in the cell orientation .",
    "the apolar symmetry of this phase will be demonstrated by investigating orientational defects as shown below .",
    "a few words to the dynamic behavior : time lapse movies of melanocytes show that the cell body performs rhythmic movements and , in addition , each cell extend and retract periodically its opposing dendrites .",
    "the dendrites find their orientation with minimum interaction with other cells @xcite .",
    "a uniform oriented nematic liquid crystal is formed if a small extracellular guiding signal is applied like parallel scratches in the surface ( fig .",
    "[ melano21 ] ) . with this method oriented single nematic liquid crystals",
    "were produced which had a size of several @xmath19 .",

    "the nematic phase contains numerous orientational point defects ( disclinations ) .",

    "[ melano41 ] .    summarizing this part",
    ", nematic liquid crystal phases can be formed either by anisotropic interacting building blocks at thermal equilibrium or by anisotropic interacting building blocks far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "an apolar nematic liquid crystal is an uniaxial system ( @xmath20 ) where the molecules are on average aligned along the director @xmath20 . in the case of an ideal nematic liquid crystal , the direction of the director @xmath21 is the same all over the sample .",
    "however , this ideal conformation will not be compatible with the constrains that are imposed by limiting boundaries",
    ". there will be some deformation of the alignment .",
    "the distance @xmath22 , over which significant variations of orientation occur , is of most interest , and is much larger than the dimensions , @xmath23 , of the building blocks .",
    "thus , the deformations may be described by a continuum theory disregarding the details of the structure on the scale of the building blocks ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "to construct such a theory one possible starting point would be the elastic distortion energy density @xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial derivatives of @xmath26 are used to construct @xmath25 .",
    "they form a tensor of rank two @xmath27 . at any point",
    "we introduce a local system of cartesian co - ordinates , x , y , z with y parallel to @xmath21 at the origin , x chosen perpendicular to y ( x - y plane are the plane where the cells migrate ) and z parallel to the normal of the plane .",

    "[ splaybend ] ) .",
    "the distortion energy of a liquid crystal specimen in a particular configuration , relative to its energy in the state of uniform orientation , is expressible at the area integral of distortion energy density @xmath30 which is a quadratic function of two differential coefficients which measure the curvature in two dimensions . @xmath31 the spontaneous splay coefficient",

    "the distortion energy can be written in the coordinate free notation @xmath41",
    "the orientational elastic constant of a nematic liquid crystal ( bulk ) can be estimated by purely dimensional arguments : one expects that the elastic constants are to be in the order of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a typical interaction energy between the molecules while @xmath23 is a molecular dimension .",
    "a typical value of the molecular interaction energy is @xmath44 8 kj / mol or @xmath45 j / molecule which corresponds to a temperature of @xmath46 k. a typical liquid crystal molecule has a length of about 1.5 nm .",

    "the orientational elastic constant of a membrane can be estimated by taking this value times the thickness , d , of the membrane .",

    "the orientational elastic constant of a nematic liquid crystal formed by living cells can be estimated in a similar way : in the case of migrating granulocytes the quasi temperature is @xmath49 k. a condensed phase can only be formed if the interaction potential , u , is in this order or even larger .",
    "this leads to an interaction energy of @xmath50 j / cell .",
    "the bulk elastic constant is obtained by dividing this interaction energy by the length of a cell ( @xmath51 m ) .",

    "the estimated orientational elastic constant of a quasi two dimensional nematic liquid crystal is then @xmath53 j.    the dependence of the orientational elastic coefficients on the apolar order parameter , @xmath54 , and the cell density , @xmath55 , can be estimated in the following way : the orientation angle of amoeboid cells is controlled by an automatic controller which compares the actual angle with the desired one @xcite .",
    "the cellular response is in such a way as to minimize the deviation between the actual angle and the desired one .",
    "the desired angle of one cell is to be parallel to another cell . in the case of a nematic liquid crystal",

    "[ dishalbex]c ) .    in nematic liquid crystals formed by elongated molecules it is assumed that the molecules in the core of a disclination are in the isotropic state .",
    "this assumption can be verified for a nematic liquid crystal formed by elongated migrating cells . there",
    "exist a sharp boundary between the nematic and the isotropic phase .",
    "the nematic phase is destroyed if the elastic energy density is larger than the mean field . @xmath157",
    "the bend elastic constant divided by the calibration coefficient b can be expressed by eq .",
    "one gets @xmath158 the maximal bending @xmath159 of a + 1/2 disclination can be determined from photographic pictures . the characteristic length , @xmath88 , of a bend deformation is expected to be in the order of the length of an elongated cell ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the observed angular change by going from one cell to the next is approximately 15 to 20 degrees .",
    "the angular change per cell as predicted by eq .",
    "[ disclincore ] is 29 degrees .",
    "the assumption that a strong bend deformation can destroy the nematic phase is verified since the predicted angular change is in accordance with the experimental observation .",
    "the practical importance of this study lies in its objective description of the liquid crystal phases formed by migrating and interacting cells .",
    "two types of nematic liquid crystals , a polar and an apolar phase , are found to be formed by certain cell types in culture and such phases may be expected to be present in many other cell types .",
    "in addition , the objective description may be useful to define and elucidate cases of cellular dysfunction , and of altered cellular function induced by specific molecules like pharmacological active molecules , etc ..    the major objective of current and future research is to go beyond this phenomenological description of the thermodynamic phases formed by migrating and interacting cells .",
    "how the cellular machinery works on a molecular scale can be investigated by considering the technical data as a frame filled with the biochemical events .",
    "the cell , regarded as a fluid self - organized molecular machine , represents a new and important field in the triangle between physics , chemistry and life sciences .",
    "the knowledge that one essential process in the cellular signal transduction chain is the supply of fresh receptors to the plasma membrane could lead to the application of new techniques . for instance",
    "the liquid crystal phase can be changed if special designed molecules are added which interact with the intracellular signal transduction chain and alter cell - cell interaction either by the induced change in the cellular shape or by the transmitted chemical signal .",
    "the process by which migrating cells exchange information constitutes one of the most intriguing areas of life sciences and physics .",
    "an individual cell transmits signals and guides its migration and orientation according to the signals it receives , these messages being chemical , sterical or electrical in nature .",
    "the physical process of reducing a gas containing freely moving molecules to a liquid form is understood to a large extent and the mean behavior of a given molecule in the interaction field of the other moving molecules may be determined by boltzmann statistics .",
    "identical principle are used to reduce freely migrating cells to a condensed state .",
    "the mean behavior of a given cell in the interacting field of other cells can be described in terms of its automatic controller .",
    "the self - organization , involved in morphogenesis , organogenesis and wound healing , takes in a new light .",
    "the nematic liquid crystal formed by migrating cells opens new perspectives in the field of cellular tissue engineering .",
    "the two dimensional nematic liquid crystal can be used as a template .",
    "for example : ( i ) cells of another type can migrate and orient on top of the liquid crystal to form more complex structures .",
    "( ii ) cells of another type can be attracted and localized in the orientational defects of the nematic liquid crystal .",
    "new types of liquid crystals are expected in analogy to blue phases where orientation defects are ordered in space .",
    "( iii ) complex structures formed by different types of cells can be altered if the phase of the template ( cellular layer of the nematic liquid crystal ) is altered by a chemical signal from a nematic liquid crystal phase to an isotropic phase .",
    "we particularly like to thank volker teichgrber for fruitful discussion .",
    "this work was supported by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and fonds der chemischen industrie .",
    "melanocytes are one type of cells in the skin .",
    "they produce and distribute the color pigment melanin via dendrites .",
    "cultured human melanocytes form the desired bipolar mode with two opposing dendrites when they are exposed to melanocytes medium .",
    "details are given in ref .",
    "briefly , skin biopsies were obtained from healthy donors .",
    "the cells were cultured in tic medium ( ham f10 , 16 % serum , 85 nm pma , 0.1 mm ibmx , 2.5 nm cholera toxin ) .",
    "cells designated for the experiment were seeded in @xmath161 dishes ( nunclon , nunc , germany ) and cultured until confluence ( approx .",
    "25 - 30 days ) .    the cells ,",
    "being of spherical shape in the suspension , come down onto the substrate and start to develop their dendrites .",
    "they stay in this shape and crawl around on the surface .",
    "the cell body of different melanocytes attract each other but the dendrites repel each other .",
    "the orientation of the dendrites occurs during a periodic retraction and elongation process in such a way that each dendrite has a minimum of contact with the surrounding cells .",
    "we used a precision motorized x - y stage on a ccd - camera ( hamamatsu ) equipped microscope ( zeiss axiovert ) and scanned an area of several mm@xmath74 using a 10x magnification lens .",
    "the pictures were digitized with a scion frame grabber card on a macintosh ppc and stored on the hard disk . the public domain software nih - image ( developed at the us national institute of health )",
    "was used for this purpose , as well as , for the further image processing .",
    "our goal is to find an algorithm which determines automatically the mean orientation of the elongated cells in a small part of the picture .",
    "this task was successfully solved by going into the fourier space .",
    "first , a squared section ( 64x64 pixels ) of a picture is chosen , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kling]a .",
    "a two - dimensional fast fourier transformation implemented in nih - image is applied to this squared section of the picture .",
    "the result is a gray scale picture as shown in fig .",
    "[ kling]b .",
    "the fourier transform arises as a diffuse cloud with a handle - shaped contour .",
    "the maximum momentum of this elongated cloud is determined and found to be parallel to the direction of the mean cell alignment . in order to evaluate the exact orientation we apply a threshold procedure to remove all pixels with a gray value below a certainthreshold value .",
    "the remaining pixels are weighted with their gray value , g(x , y ) , and the angle , @xmath61 , of the orientation axis is found by maximizing the `` momentum of mass '' .",
    "more details to the procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "@xmath162 with @xmath163 and m@xmath164 and m@xmath165 analogous .",
    "this procedure is repeated for the next squared section of the picture .",
    "the scan was performed with overlapping squared sections .",
    "the shift length was half of the square size .",
