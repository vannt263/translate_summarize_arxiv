    "although acting simultaneously in real systems , theoretically both mechanisms can be turned on and off independently and it was found@xcite that the scattering of spin - orbit coupled band carriers from magnetically polarized impurities should dominate in the diluted magnetic semiconductors .",
    "building on the analogy with ahe studies we seek further insight into the basic physics of this amr mechanism by focusing on the archetypical spin - orbit coupled two - dimensional systems .    using the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) and starting with the rashba and dresselhaus models we show in sec .",

    "examination of the rashba and dresselhaus models allows us to draw separate links between the spin - texture and the non - crystalline and crystalline amr components where the non - crystalline amr depends on the relative angle between @xmath6 and current @xmath7 while the crystalline amr has an additional dependence on the absolute orientation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the coordinate system of the crystal axes .",

    "<S> anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) is a relativistic magnetotransport phenomenon arising from combined effects of spin - orbit coupling and broken symmetry of a ferromagnetically ordered state of the system . in this work we focus on one realization of the amr in which spin - orbit coupling enters via specific spin - textures on the carrier fermi surfaces and ferromagnetism via elastic scattering of carriers from polarized magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we report detailed heuristic examination , using model spin - orbit coupled systems , of the emergence of positive amr ( maximum resistivity for magnetization along current ) , negative amr ( minimum resistivity for magnetization along current ) , and of the crystalline amr ( resistivity depends on the absolute orientation of the magnetization and current vectors with respect to the crystal axes ) components . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize potential qualitative differences between pure magnetic and combined electro - magnetic impurity potentials , between short - range and long - range impurities , and between spin-1/2 and higher spin - state carriers . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions based on our heuristic analysis are supported by exact solutions to the integral form of the boltzmann transport equation in archetypical two - dimensional electron systems with rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions and in the three - dimensional spherical kohn - littinger model . </S>",
    "<S> we include comments on the relation of our microscopic calculations to standard phenomenology of the full angular dependence of the amr , and on the relevance of our study to realistic , two - dimensional conduction - band carrier systems and to anisotropic transport in the valence band of diluted magnetic semiconductors . </S>"
