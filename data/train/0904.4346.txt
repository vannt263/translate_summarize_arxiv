    "the possibility of exploiting the mssbauer  effect in weak interactions to enhance the small neutrino cross sections  @xcite has recently received considerable interest , both from the experimental side  @xcite and from the theoretical side  @xcite . in the proposed experiment ,",
    "neutrinos are emitted from @xmath1 atoms embedded into a metal crystal and absorbed by @xmath2 atoms embedded into a similar crystal . with very optimistic assumptions on the source activity ( 1  mci ) , the fraction of recoilfree emissions and absorptions ( 0.28 each ) , and the achievable spectral line width ( @xmath3 ) , it has been estimates that an event rate of @xmath4 per day could be achieved for a detector containing 1  g of @xmath2 and placed at a baseline @xmath5  m  @xcite . , corresponding to the natural line width of tritium decay  @xcite .",
    "this would imply an additional enhancement of the event rate by a factor of @xmath6 , allowing for smaller sources and detectors , or for longer baselines .",
    "however , the arguments given in  @xcite in favor of this additional enhancement have been disproven in ref .",
    "these events could be counted by observing the subsequent decays of the produced @xmath1 in the detector , or by chemically extracting and counting the number of produced @xmath1 atoms .",
    "however , it is far from clear whether the above experimental performance can be achieved in practice , and , in fact , the event rate may well be many orders of magnitude smaller  @xcite , so that the question of whether a mssbauer  neutrino experiment can be realized in practice is still open .    in spite of this ,",
    "mssbauer  neutrinos have already now proven to be an excellent test case for studying the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory of neutrino oscillations theoretically .",
    "in particular , their extremely small energy spread of @xmath7  @xcite has led to the question whether a coherent emission and absorption of different neutrino mass eigenstates , which is a prerequisite for oscillations , is possible  @xcite .",
    "even though a detailed quantum field theoretical treatment , requiring no a priori assumptions on the neutrino wave function , shows that oscillations do occur in a mssbauerneutrino experiment  @xcite , such an approach also reveals that mssbauer  neutrinos are special because many of the assumptions and approximations that are commonly made in the theoretical treatment of conventional neutrino oscillation experiments are invalid for them .    in this paper",

    "[ sec : qft ] , we will derive the combined rate of mssbauer  neutrino emission , propagation , and detection in quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "we will for the first time explicitly include homogeneous line broadening effects arising from fluctuating electromagnetic fields in the solid state crystals forming the mssbauer  source and detector , and we will show that , as anticipated in ref .",

    "@xcite that the resulting formula for @xmath0 agrees precisely with the one obtained in @xcite for the case of inhomogeneous line broadening caused by crystal defects and impurities .",
    "in particular , we have confirmed that , also for homogeneous line broadening , @xmath0 has a breit - wigner - like resonance structure , and contains oscillation , localization , and coherence exponentials .",
    "moreover , our formula accounts for the suppression of recoilless emission and absorption processes compared to their non - recoilless counterparts through a generalized lamb - mssbauer  factor .",
    "we have also noted that in realistic experiments the localization and decoherence terms are irrelevant and may be set equal to unity .",
    "the localization term enforces the condition that the quantum mechanical delocalization of the neutrino source and detector have to be small compared to the oscillation lengths for oscillations to take place , a condition that is easily fulfilled in any oscillation experiment .",
    "the decoherence term , on the other hand , accounts for the possibility of wave packet separation due to the different group velocities associated with different neutrino mass eigenstates , but also this does not happen in terrestrial experiments .",
    "we have then proceeded to a derivation of @xmath0 in a quantum mechanical approach , in which the neutrino is described by a lorentzian wave packet of the form .",
    "we have arrived at eq .  , which coincides with the qft result .",
    "however , since the neutrino production and detection processes , which involve particle creation and annihilation , can not be described in qm , the mssbauer  neutrino production rate as well as the detection cross section had to be put in by hand . also , the properties of the neutrino wave packets ( shape , width , central momenta ) had to be chosen in an ad hoc way instead of emerging naturally from the formalism or being related to properties of the source and the detector .",
    "once the appropriate choices for these parameters are made , the breit - wigner - shaped resonance factor as well as the oscillation and decoherence terms can be derived .",
    "the correct lamb - mssbauer  and localization factors are obtained only if suitably chosen phenomenological weighting factors @xmath137 , @xmath138 for the different neutrino mass eigenstates are introduced in the neutrino wave function to account for the tiny dependence of the emission and absorption probabilities on the neutrino mass .",
    "as expected , @xmath0 factorizes into the emitted neutrino flux , a transition probability @xmath159 , and the detection cross section .",
    "while in the qm approach , this property is introduced as an assumption in eq .  , it emerges naturally in qft .",
    "the reason is that for large propagation distance @xmath203 off - shell effects become negligible , and according to the grimus - stockinger theorem eq .",
    "the propagator then reduces to the exponential phase factor @xmath204 ( with @xmath154 being the modulus of the neutrino momentum ) , which is also used in qm to describe the spatial evolution of particles .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the qm approach to mssbauer  neutrino oscillations , in which the production , propagation , and detection processes are treated separately , is able to reproduce the results obtained in the qft approach , in which these processes are a priori considered as a single entity and their factorization emerges as a result .",
    "in general , the framework of qft is significantly more robust because it does not require any assumptions on the neutrino wave function , whose parameters are instead automatically determined from the much less ambiguous properties of the neutrino source and the detector .",
    "for example , homogeneous and inhomogeneous line broadening are easy to implement in qft ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : qft ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while in qm , they have to be accounted for by choosing appropriate wave packet widths .",
    "also , the emission rate , the detection cross section , and the lamb - mssbauerfactor can not be predicted in qm and have to be put in by hand . on the other hand , the qm approach can give a better physical understanding of the origin of oscillation , decoherence , and resonance phenomena once all free parameters are chosen appropriately , e.g.  by matching with the qft result .",
