    "it was first pointed out by andrej sakharov in 1967 @xcite that the non observation of primordial antimatter in the observable universe could be related to fundamental properties of particle physics and in particular to the violation of a particular symmetry , called @xmath0 , that was discovered just three years before the sakharov paper in the decays of newly discovered particles called @xmath1 mesons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 transformation is the combination of the transformation of parity @xmath2 , corresponding to flipping the sign of all space coordinates , and of charge conjugation @xmath3 , corresponding to flip the sign of all charges of the elementary particles , including the electric charge .",
    "the fact that the laws of physics are not invariant under @xmath0 transformation , implies that matter and antimatter can behave differently in elementary processes .",
    "today the prescient idea of sakharov is supported by a host of cosmological observations that show how the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe has to be explained in terms of a dynamical generation mechanism , what is called a model of baryogenesis , incorporating @xmath0 violation . at the same time",
    "it has been realised that a successful model of baryogenesis can not be attained within the current standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and it has therefore to be regarded as a necessity of extending the sm with a model beyond the sm , or , more shortly , with some ` new physics ' .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing in neutrino oscillation experiments in 1998 @xcite , has for the first time shown directly , in particle physics experiments , that the sm is indeed incomplete , since it strictly predicts that neutrinos are massless and , therefore , can not oscillate .",
    "therefore , this discovery has greatly increased the interest in a mechanism of baryogenesis called leptogenesis @xcite , a model of baryogenesis that is a cosmological consequence of the most popular way to extend the sm in order to explain why neutrinos are massive but at the same time much lighter than all other fermions : the see - saw mechanism @xcite .    in this way",
    "leptogenesis realises a highly non trivial link between two completely independent experimental observations : the absence of primordial antimatter in the observable universe and the observation that neutrinos mix and ( therefore ) have masses .",
    "leptogenesis has , therefore , a naturally built - in double sided nature .",
    "on one side , it describes a very early stage in the history of the universe characterised by temperatures @xmath4 , much higher than those probed by big bang nucleosynthesis ( @xmath5 ) , and therefore temperatures are expressed in electronvolts , the usual unit of energy in particle and early universe physics . ] and on another side it complements low energy neutrino experiments providing a completely independent phenomenological tool to test models of new physics embedding the see - saw mechanism .    before reviewing the main features and results in leptogenesis",
    ", we will first need to discuss , in the next section , the cosmological framework justifying the necessity of a model of baryogenesis and then , in section 3 , the main experimental results in the study of neutrino masses and mixing parameters and the main features of the see - saw mechanism .",
    "neutrino experiments and see - saw mechanism together suggest leptogenesis to be today probably the most plausible candidate for the explanation of the matter - anti matter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "in the hot big bang model , the history of the universe has two quite well distinguished stages . in a first hot phase ,",
    "the early universe , matter and radiation were coupled and the growth of baryonic matter perturbations was inhibited . in this stage matter was in the form of a plasma and properties of elementary particles were crucial in determining the evolution of the universe .",
    "after matter - radiation decoupling occurring during the so called re - combination epoch , when electrons combined with protons and helium-4 nuclei to form atoms , baryonic matter perturbations could grow quite quickly under the action of dark matter inhomogeneities , forming the large - scale structure that we observe .    with the astonishing progress in observational cosmology during the last 15 years , we have today quite a robust minimal cosmological model , the so called ` @xmath7-cold dark matter ' ( @xmath6cdm ) model sometime popularly dubbed as the ` vanilla model ' .",
    "the @xmath6cdm model is very successful in explaining all current cosmological observations and its parameters are currently measured with a precision better than @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath6cdm model relies on general relativity , the einstein s theory of gravity , for a description of the gravitational interactions on cosmic scales .",
    "it belongs to the class of friedmann cosmological models based on the assumption of the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe . in this case",
    "the space - time geometry is conveniently described in the so called comoving system by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric in terms of just one time - dependent parameter : the scale factor .",
    "the distances among objects at rest with respect to the comoving system are just all proportional to the scale factor , as the distances of points on the surface of an inflating balloon .",
    "the expansion of the universe is then described in terms of the scale factor time dependence that can be worked out as a solution of the friedmann equations .",
    "however , a solution of the friedmann equations also requires the knowledge of the energy - matter content of the universe . in this respect",
    ", the @xmath6cdm model also belongs to a sub - class of friedmann models , the lemaitre models , where the energy - matter content is described by an admixture of three different forms of fluids : i ) matter , the non - relativistic component where energy is dominated by the mass term ; ii ) radiation , the ultra - relativistic component where energy is dominated by the kinetic energy term ( in the case of photons this is exactly true ) ; iii ) vacuum energy density and/or a cosmological constant term .",
    "the latter , if positive , can be responsible for a repulsive behaviour of gravity and it was first introduced by einstein in 1917 in the equations bearing his name in order to balance the attractive action of matter and obtain a static universe . at that time",
    "there was no evidence for an expansion of the universe and a static model represented the most attractive solution .",
    "however , with the discovery of the expansion of the universe by edwin hubble in 1929 , it became clear that a successful cosmological model should contain a time variation of the scale factor .",
    "the cosmological constant became for a long time a mere theoretical possibility invoked , from time to time , to solve different observational problems without however any conclusive evidence .",
    "lemaitre studied in great details these models containing an additional cosmological constant term .    today ,",
    "thanks to the precision and accuracy of the current cosmological observations , we have a very strong indication that indeed the expansion of the universe is described by a lemaitre model with a positive cosmological constant whose action is completely equivalent to have a non - vanishing vacuum energy density .",
    "the necessity of a positive cosmological constant comes from the observed acceleration of the universe at the present time , first discovered from the determination of the supernovae type ia redshifts versus luminosity distances relation , a discovery that has been awarded the 2011 nobel prize for physics @xcite .",
    "the presence of a cosmological constant , indicated with the symbol @xmath6 , as in the einstein original paper , is therefore an important distinguishing feature of the @xmath6cdm model , as clearly indicated by the name .",
    "so far any attempt to reproduce the acceleration of the universe with an alternative explanation either failed or it is indistinguishable from @xmath6 in current observations and it therefore represents an unnecessary complication of the @xmath6cdm model that is in this way the minimal model able to reproduce all observations .    in friedmann models ,",
    "the space - time geometry can be of three types , closed , open or flat depending whether the present value of the energy density parameter , @xmath9 , is respectively bigger , smaller or equal to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total energy density and @xmath12 is the so called critical energy density , both calculated at the present time .",
    ", where @xmath13 is the hubble constant and @xmath14 is newton s constant . ]",
    "the cosmological observations strongly indicate that the current geometry of the universe is very close to be flat , a point to which we shall soon return . in the @xmath6cdm model , the flatness of the universe",
    "is set up to be exactly zero , another important distinguishing feature , that has a very robust theoretical justification , as we will discuss .",
    "the current cosmological observations are also able to determine quite precisely the values of the different contributions to the total energy density from the three different fluids in the @xmath6cdm model : radiation contributes at the present time only with a tiny @xmath15 , matter gives a more significant @xmath16 contribution , while the dominant remaining @xmath17 contribution is in the form of a cosmological constant and/or vacuum energy density .",
    "this particular combination of values , a sort of cosmological recipe , reproduces very well all cosmological observations and in particular the above - mentioned acceleration of the universe at the present time .",
    "a fundamental ingredient of the @xmath6cdm model is the existence of a very early stage in the history of the universe called inflation @xcite , characterised by a super - luminal expansion , that was able to bring a microscopic sub - atomic portion of space to have a macroscopic size corresponding today to our observable universe where a homogeneous , isotropic and a flat space - time geometry holds with very good approximation .",
    "in this way homogeneity , isotropy and flatness of the universe have not to be postulated but are instead a natural result of the inflationary stage",
    ". however , inflation also predicts , at the end of the inflationary stage , the presence of primordial perturbations that acted as seeds for the formation of galaxies , clusters of galaxies and super - clusters of galaxies : the so called large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the same primordial perturbations are also responsible for the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies and for their properties . in particular for the explanation of the so called acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "the acoustic peaks originate from the compression and rarefaction of the coupled baryon - photon fluid at the time of recombination .",
    "the angular power spectrum at a value of the multipole number @xmath18 is determined by the presence of anisotropies of angular size @xmath19 .",
    "the existence and position of the first peak at a multipole number @xmath20 , corresponds to regions of the early universe with a size given by the distance that sound could have traveled within the recombination time , the so called _",
    "sound horizon_. the angular size of such a region depends also on the geometry of the universe and it can be proven that in general the position of the first peak would be @xmath21 .",
    "the experimental observation that @xmath20 provides therefore the strongest indication that @xmath22 , confirming , within current experimental errors , the expectation of a flat universe geometry coming from inflation .",
    "the acoustic peaks are probably today the most important source of experimental information on the cosmological parameters supporting the @xmath6cdm model .    from this precise and accurate determination of the cosmological parameters of the @xmath6cdm model , we also know that the early universe stage lasted about 450,000 years , only a short time compared to the total age of the universe @xmath23 that in the @xmath6cdm turns out to be about 13.75 billions of years .",
    "the existence of a first hot stage is not only fundamental to understand the existence and the properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and the nuclear composition of the universe with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) but it also seems to enclose the secrets for the solution of those cosmological puzzles of the @xmath7cdm model that strongly hint at new physics .",
    "these include : i ) the existence of dark matter , that has a crucial role in making possible the quick formation of galaxies after the matter - radiation decoupling ; ii ) the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe ; iii ) the necessity of an inflationary stage and iv ) the presence of the mysterious form of energy , currently indistinguishable from a cosmological constant , that is driving the acceleration of the universe at the present time .",
    "interestingly recent cmb observations seem also to hint at the presence of some extra - radiation during recombination @xcite .",
    "indeed within the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) and from the existing upper bounds on neutrino masses , that we will discuss in a moment , we know that the only particle species that can contribute to the radiation component during the recombination time , to which the observed cmb properties can be ascribed , are photons and three known species of neutrinos in thermal equilibrium.cdm model .",
    "there are also models where a non - thermal radiation component can be present .",
    "] current observations seem to suggest the presence of an additional radiation component equivalent approximately to one additional neutrino species in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the results from the planck satellite , launched in june 2010 and currently taking data able to yield the most accurate cmb anisotropies maps , are expected to be published in january 2013 and will be able to shed a light on this current anomaly , since it will be able to measure the amount of radiation in terms of effective number of neutrino species @xmath24 with an error @xmath25 . the current measured range , @xmath26 ( at @xmath27 c.l . ) , seem in any case to confirm the presence of a thermal component of neutrinos during the early universe stage .    for a long time",
    "neutrinos were also thought to be the natural dark matter candidate .",
    "massive neutrinos would indeed yield at the present time a contribution to @xmath28 , given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the three neutrino masses and @xmath31 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath32 , whose measurement has been recently improved by the hubble space telescope collaboration finding @xmath33 @xcite .    therefore , the measured value of the dark matter contribution to the energy density parameter , @xmath34 @xcite , could be in principle easily explained with massive neutrinos with @xmath35 .",
    "sufficiently large neutrino masses could therefore solve the dark matter puzzle from a pure energetic point of view .",
    "interestingly , neutrino oscillation experiments imply that neutrino are indeed massive and place a lower bound on the sum of the neutrino masses , @xmath36 .",
    "however , from the theory of structure formation , we know that such light neutrinos would behave as ` hot dark matter ' particles , i.e. particles that are ultra - relativistic at the time of the matter - radiation equality when the temperature of the universe @xmath37 was @xmath38 .    on the other hand current observations strongly favour the @xmath6cdm model where dark matter is purely ` cold ' , i.e. made of particles that were fully non - relativistic at the matter - radiation equality time .",
    "they do not leave much room for a hot dark matter component since even a small fraction , @xmath39 , would lead to a large - scale structure in disagreement with the observations .",
    "this translates into a very stringent limit on the sum of the neutrino masses @xcite [ wmap7 ] _",
    "i m_i 0.58ev ( 95% c.l . ) . therefore , though the results from neutrino oscillation experiments could have represented an opportunity for neutrino masses to play a fundamental role in cosmology , with the advent of the @xmath6cdm model , this became soon a sort of pyrrhic victory . with vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses was then announced , even in newspapers , as a confirmation of the presence of hot dark matter establishing a fundamental role of neutrino masses in cosmology . however , the same year , the discovery of the acceleration of the universe @xcite marked the decline of the hcdm model and the advent of @xmath6cdm model that , as we have seen , rules the marginal role of a hot dark matter component .",
    "this is why the 1998 discovery of neutrino masses can be so far regarded as a pyrrhic victory for the role that they play in cosmology . ]",
    "however , there is another intriguing possibility that emerged from neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the current narrow experimentally allowed window for the sum of the neutrino masses , @xmath40 , seems to be optimal for these to have played a completely different but equally fundamental cosmological role : the generation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .      before the precise observations of the cmb temperature anisotropies , bbn has provided a way to measure the amount of baryons in the universe during a period of time between freeze out of neutron - to - proton abundance ratio and deuterium synthesis , corresponding approximately to @xmath41 . in standard",
    "bbn , given the value of the neutron life time , the predictions on the primordial nuclear abundances can be expressed in term of the value of the baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , any measurement of a primordial nuclear abundance can be translated , in standard bbn , into a measurement of @xmath43 . moreover in a standard picture , @xmath43 is constant after the end of the bbn and , therefore , the value derived from bbn is equal to the value at the present time . in this way",
    "@xmath44 can be also related to the baryonic contribution to the energy density parameter , explicitly _",
    "b 273.6_b,0h^2 10 ^ -10 .",
    "the best ` baryometer ' @xcite has long been known to be the deuterium abundance , since this has a strong dependence on @xmath43 ( @xmath45 ) . from the measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance it is found @xcite _",
    "b^d / h = ( 5.9 0.5 ) 10 ^ -10 .",
    "a completely independent measurement of @xmath43 during the recombination epoch coming from a fit of the cmb acoustic peaks and latest results from wmap7 data gives @xcite [ etabcmb ] _",
    "b^cmb = ( 6.2 0.15 ) 10 ^ -10 .",
    "it should be said that , differently from the other cosmological parameters , it is measured that precisely ( @xmath46 ) using just cmb data .",
    "moreover it is also quite insensitive to the so called ` priors ' assumed in the @xmath6cdm model ( for example whether neutrinos have a mass or not ) . and @xmath47 .",
    "]    the impressive coincidence between these two independent measurements of @xmath44 can be not only regarded as a great success of the hot big bang models but it also strongly constrains variations of @xmath43 between the time of bbn @xmath48 and the recombination time @xmath49 . considering that only quite exotic effects could have changed the value of @xmath43 until the present time without spoiling the thermal equilibrium of cmb , this can therefore be regarded as a measurement of @xmath43 at the present time as well .",
    "both measurements of @xmath44 , from standard bbn and from cmb , are not sensitive to the sign of @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , they are not able alone to test the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "one could for example always invoke , in order to reconcile a matter - antimatter symmetric universe with bbn and ( more recently ) cmb measurements of @xmath43 , some unspecified mechanism that segregated matter and antimatter so that our universe would be made of a patch of matter and antimatter domains . however , combining the small deviations from thermal equilibrium of cmb with cosmic rays observations constraining annihilations at the borders of the domains , one can exclude such a possibility unless assuming very ad hoc geometrical configurations @xcite .    barring therefore the possibility that primordial antimatter escapes current observations in a very exotic way , we can conclude that @xmath43 is positive everywhere , that primordial @xmath50 and that therefore our observable universe is matter - antimatter asymmetric with no presence of primordial antimatter whatsoever .    at first sight",
    "this observation does not seem to be a real issue since one could after all assume that the observed value of @xmath43 is just an initial set up value not requiring any explanation .",
    "however , this legitimate minimal solution is not compatible with the @xmath6cdm model where an inflationary stage is a crucial ingredient .",
    "a qualitative argument is that within inflation our observable universe would correspond to the magnification of such a tiny region , that thus can be assumed to be simply empty at the end of inflation , except for the presence of a vacuum energy density responsible for the inflationary stage itself .",
    "therefore , according to inflation , all the matter and the antimatter that we observe today , including the matter - antimatter asymmetry , had to be produced after inflation .    in this way",
    ", one arrives at the conclusion that the baryon asymmetry must have been dynamically generated either after inflation and prior to the bbn epoch or in any case during the latest period of the inflationary stage , i.e. to the necessity of a model of baryogenesis in complete agreement with the much earlier sakharov s idea .    in his famous prescient paper @xcite ,",
    "sakharov identified , either explicitly or implicitly , three famous necessary conditions , bearing now his name , for a successful model of baryogenesis : ( i ) the existence of an elementary process that violates the baryon number , ( ii ) violation of charge conjugation @xmath3 and of @xmath51 , where @xmath2 indicates parity transformation , ( iii ) a departure from thermal equilibrium during baryogenesis .",
    "notice that the departure from thermal equilibrium has to be permanent , since otherwise the baryon asymmetry would be subsequently washed - out if thermal equilibrium is restored .",
    "it was realised in the mid 80 s that , within the sm , the sakharov conditions are all fulfilled to some level .",
    "it became then important to give a quantitative estimation , finding the most stringent conditions for a baryon asymmetry to be generated at the level of the observed value .",
    "the most efficient model is realised by electroweak baryogenesis @xcite . a strong departure from thermal equilibrium",
    "is obtained if at the electroweak symmetry breaking a strong first order phase transition occurs accompanied by the nucleation of bubbles . inside the expanding bubbles electroweak symmetry",
    "is broken , outside is unbroken .",
    "particles and anti - particles outside the bubble cross the bubble wall with a different rate in a way that an asymmetry is generated inside the bubble .",
    "if the transition is strong enough such an asymmetry is not washed - out and can survive until the present time . unfortunately the condition for a strong first order phase transition implies a stringent upper bound on the higgs mass @xmath52 clearly at odds with the lep lower bound @xmath53 .",
    "nobody has found another model of baryogenesis not requiring some extension of the sm .",
    "for this reason the matter - antimatter asymmetry is nowadays regarded as strong evidence of new physics .",
    ", is found @xcite but values @xmath54 are possible only within quite a small corner in the parameter space . for this reason the recent data from the large hadron collider , favouring a sm - like higgs boson mass around @xmath55 , are very challenging for electroweak baryogenesis within the mssm .",
    "it is important to notice this point because electro - weak baryogenesis is probably the strongest competitor of leptogenesis . ]",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses and mixing in neutrino oscillation experiments is the first clear indication of new physics in laboratory experiments .",

    "the first one is that neutrino flavour eigenstates @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) do not coincide with neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) but are obtained applying to these a unitary transformation described by a @xmath60 unitary leptonic mixing matrix @xmath61 , [ mixing ] _ = _",

    "the sm is a quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "all physical laws can ultimately be extracted by a fundamental object that is the lagrangian , exactly like in classical systems .",

    "the quantum states that correspond to the excitations of the quantum fields correspond to the free elementary particles . in this way both matter and radiation are described in the same way .",
    "the lagrangian contains not only ( kinetic ) terms describing the evolution of the free fields but also terms describing interactions among fields .",
    "these terms are not arbitrary but emerge once particular ` symmetries ' are imposed on the lagrangian . in modern quantum field theories the symmetries are elements of a ` gauge group ' and the sm is based on symmetries of a non - abelian gauge group called @xmath94 . within the sm , neutrinos play quite a special role since they are massless and since they can have only one helicity , the left - handed one .",

    "the mechanism requires the existence of rh particles .",
    "therefore , in the sm , neutrinos do not acquire any mass simply because they do not couple to @xmath110 .",
    "however , when rh neutrinos are added with yukawa couplings @xmath31 to @xmath110 , a neutrino dirac mass term @xmath111 is generated as for all the other massive fermions . if this were the whole story , one could easily understand why neutrinos are massive but not why they are orders - of - magnitude lighter than all the other particles .",

    "however , it is a compact conventional notation to indicate that all eigenvalues of @xmath98 have to be much greater than all eigenvalues of @xmath113 , or , equivalently , that the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath98 has to be much greater than the largest eigenvalue of @xmath113 . ]",
    "the spectrum of ( ordinary ) neutrino masses splits into a light set given by the eigenvalues @xmath114 of the neutrino mass matrix [ see - saw ] m _ = - m_d1mm_d^t and into a ( new ) heavy set coinciding with very good approximation with the eigenvalues @xmath115 of the majorana mass matrix @xmath98 and corresponding to eigenstates @xmath116 .",
    "notice that in this formula @xmath117 .",
    "this notation emphasises the pictorial ` see - saw ' analogy ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "consider indeed a toy model case where there is only one neutrino mass scale ( it can be regarded as an approximation limit case for @xmath118 ) and all matrices reduces to simple numbers .",
    "if one chooses for the neutrino dirac mass a value @xmath119 , the electroweak scale dictating the masses of all other fermions , then one can see that the atmospheric neutrino mass scale @xmath76 is reproduced for a value of @xmath120 , intriguingly very close ( order - of - magnitude wise ) to the grand - unified scale @xmath121 : as in a see - saw , the huge rh neutrino mass @xmath98 , ` sitting downstairs ' in the see - saw formula ( [ see - saw ] ) and pivoting on @xmath113 , is able to push down the light neutrino mass @xmath122 .",
    "it should then be noticed a very important implication of the see - saw mechanism : the light neutrino mass scale is not a fundamental scale , but an algebraic by - product of the combination of two much bigger scales . within this picture ,",
    "neutrino physics becomes then a portal , at low energies , of new physics at very high energies .    if we now consider the realistic case with three neutrino masses , the @xmath60 symmetric neutrino mass matrix @xmath122 is diagonalised by a unitary matrix @xmath61 , explicitly d_m",

    "the masses of the rh neutrinos are very model dependent .",
    "however it is fair to say that in order to reproduce the measured light neutrino mass scales and barring fine tuned choices of the parameters , typical proposed models give an heaviest rh neutrino mass @xmath124 .",
    "this is the minimal version of the see - saw mechanism , often indicated as type i see - saw mechanism .",
    "the see - saw formula eq .  ( [ see - saw ] ) can be recast as an orthogonality condition for a matrix @xmath125 that , in a basis where simultaneously the charged lepton mass matrix and the majorana mass matrix are diagonal , provides a useful parametrisation of the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xcite , [ orthogonal ] m_d = ud_m^1/2 d_m^1/2 , where we defined @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the orthogonal matrix @xmath128 encodes the properties of the heavy rh neutrinos , the three life times and the three total @xmath0 asymmetries .",
    "this parametrisation is quite useful since , given a model that specifies @xmath113 and the three rh neutrino masses @xmath129 , through it one can easily impose both the experimental information on the @xmath130 low energy neutrino parameters in @xmath61 and @xmath30 and , as we will see , also the requirement of successful leptogenesis .",
    "in the most general approach the asymmetry depends on all the 18 see - saw parameters that can be identified with nine low energy parameters ( three light neutrino masses plus the six parameters in the leptonic mixing matrix ) and nine high energy neutrino parameters associated to the three rh neutrino properties ( masses , lifetimes and total @xmath0 asymmetries ) .",
    "moreover the calculation itself presents different technical difficulties .",
    "however , there is a simplified scenario @xcite that grasps most of the main features of leptogenesis and is able to highlight important connections with the low energy neutrino parameters in an approximated way .",
    "we will refer to this scenario as ` vanilla leptogenesis ' .",
    "we discuss the main features , assumptions and approximations .",
    "the discussion can be conveniently split into two parts : in the first part we discuss how the abundance of the rh neutrinos is calculated during the expansion of the universe , while in the second part we describe how the baryon asymmetry is calculated .",
    "leptogenesis belongs to a class of models of baryogenesis where the asymmetry is generated from the out - of - equilibrium decays of very heavy particles , quite interestingly the same class as the first model proposed by sakharov belongs .",
    "this class of models became very popular with the advent of grand - unified theories ( guts ) that provided a specific well definite and motivated framework . in gut",
    "baryogenesis models the very heavy particles are the same new gauge bosons predicted by guts . however , the final asymmetry depends on too many untestable parameters , so that imposing successful baryogenesis does not lead to compelling experimental predictions .",
    "this lack of predictability is made even stronger considering that the decaying particles are too heavy to be produced thermally and one has therefore to invoke a non - thermal production mechanism of the gauge bosons .",
    "this is because while the mass of the gauge bosons is about the grandunification scale , @xmath131 , the reheating temperature at the end of inflation @xmath132 can not be higher than @xmath133 from cmb observations .",
    "the reheating temperature is the initial value of the temperature at the beginning of the radiation dominated regime after inflation .",
    "below this temperature the inflationary stage can , therefore , be considered concluded .    the minimal ( and original ) version of leptogenesis is based on the type",
    "i see - saw mechanism and the asymmetry is produced by the three heavy rh neutrinos .",

    "in the last years , the inclusion of flavour effects in the calculation of the final asymmetry proved to yield the most significant changes to the calculation of the final asymmetry going beyond the vanilla scenario .",

    "the lepton quantum states evolve coherently between the production from a @xmath208-decay and a subsequent inverse decay with an higgs boson and the lepton flavour composition does not play any role in the calculation of the final asymmetry .    however , if @xmath255 , during the relevant period of generation of the asymmetry , it can be shown that the rate of the tauon lepton interactions becomes much larger than the inverse decay rate . as a consequence , the produced lepton quantum states on average , between one decay and a subsequent inverse decay ,",
    "interact with tauons . in this way",
    "the tauon component of the lepton quantum states is measured by the thermal bath and the coherent evolution breaks down . therefore , at the subsequent inverse decay , the leptonic quantum states are an incoherent mixture of a tauon component and of a ( still coherent ) superposition of an electron and of a muon component that we can indicate with @xmath256 .",
    "the fraction of the asymmetry stored in each flavour component is not proportional in general to the branching ratio of that component .",
    "this implies that the two flavour asymmetries , the tauon and the @xmath257 components , evolve differently and have to be calculated separately . in this way",
    "the resulting final asymmetry can considerably differ from the result one would obtain in the unflavoured regime . this regime is called the ` two fully flavoured regime ' .",
    "if @xmath258 , then even the coherence of the @xmath257 component is broken by the muon interactions between decays and inverse decays during the relevant period of generation of the asymmetry .",
    "in this situation all three flavoured asymmetries ( electron , muon and tauon asymmetries ) evolve independently of each other and a ` three fully flavoured regime ' applies . in the intermediate regimes",
    "a density matrix formalism is necessary to properly describe decoherence @xcite .",

    "( [ berhnabundances ] ) ) . in the first term of the right - hand side",
    ", we have a source term for the flavoured asymmetry that is proportional to the the flavoured @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath262 .",
    "in general , for a given rh neutrino @xmath145 , the flavoured @xmath0 asymmetries are defined as _ i - _ i-|_i _ i+|_i , where @xmath263 and @xmath264 and @xmath265 and @xmath266 are respectively the branching ratios for the decay of the rh neutrino @xmath145 into a lepton @xmath143 and into an anti - lepton @xmath267 .    the wash - out factor is smaller than in the unflavoured case since @xmath268 is now replaced by @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is the average of @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "correspondingly , it will also prove useful to define the flavoured decay parameters @xmath273 .",
    "the final @xmath148 asymmetry has now to be calculated as the sum of the final values of the flavoured asymmetries , @xmath274 . even though the kinetic equations for the @xmath260 ( cf .",
    "( [ flke ] ) ) are analogous to the eq .",
    "( [ unflke ] ) for the calculation of @xmath220 in the unflavoured regime , the final result for @xmath44 can be in general very different .",
    "the most drastic departure from the unflavoured results is the special case @xmath275 . in the vanilla scenario , assuming the unflavoured regime , this would simply yield @xmath276 , i.e. no asymmetry would be produced at all .",
    "this is in agreement with an extension of the sakharov condition to vanilla leptogenesis that implies that @xmath148 has not to be conserved .",

    "we can summarise the results for the calculation of the baryon asymmetry within the fully flavoured regimes ( two or three ) saying that lepton flavour effects induce three major consequences .",
    "i ) the wash - out can be considerably lower than in the unflavoured regime @xcite .",
    "ii ) the low energy phases affect directly the final asymmetry since they contribute to a second source of @xmath0 violation in the flavoured @xmath0 asymmetries @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the same source of @xmath0 violation that could take place in neutrino oscillations , could be sufficient to explain the observed asymmetry , though under quite stringent conditions on the rh neutrino mass spectrum . in the light of the recent overwhelming evidence of a non - vanishing @xmath63 angle @xcite , a necessary condition to have @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillations",
    ", this problem becomes particularly interesting , in particular a precise calculation , within a density matrix formalism , of the lower bound on @xmath63 .",
    "iii ) compared to the total @xmath0 asymmetries , the flavoured @xmath0 asymmetries contain extra - terms that are not upper bounded if one allows for a cancelations in the see - saw formula among the light neutrino mass terms together with a mild rh neutrino mass hierarchy ( @xmath287 ) . in this way",
    "the lower bound on @xmath132 can be relaxed by about one order of magnitude , down to @xmath288 @xcite as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "however for most models , such as sequential dominated models @xcite , these cancellations do not occur . in this case",
    "lepton flavour effects can not relax the lower bound on @xmath235 .      as we have seen , when lepton flavour effects are neglected , the possibility that the next - to - lightest rh neutrino decays contribute to the final asymmetry is a special case .",
    "on the other hand , when lepton flavour effects are taken into account , the contribution from next - to - lightest rh neutrinos can not be neglected in general .",
    "even the contribution from the heaviest rh neutrinos can be sizeable in some cases and has to be taken into account in general .",
    "assuming hierarchical mass patterns and that the rh neutrino processes occur in one of the three fully flavoured regimes , there are 10 possible different mass patterns to consider ( see fig .",
    "6 ) requiring specific multi - stage sets of classical boltzmann equations for the calculation of the final asymmetry .      among the possible",
    "10 rh neutrino mass patterns shown in fig .  6 , for those three where the @xmath208 wash - out occurs in the three fully flavoured regime , for @xmath289 , the asymmetry produced by the lightest rh neutrinos is much lower than the observed value eq .",
    "( [ etabcmb ] ) .",
    "the reason is that for these low values of the rh neutrino masses , the flavoured @xmath0 asymmetries of the lightest rh neutrinos are too small .",
    "therefore , the final asymmetry has necessarily to be produced by the heavier rh neutrinos , usually from the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos , since the @xmath0 asymmetries of the heaviest rh neutrinos @xmath253 are typically suppressed .",
    "the asymmetry can be produced from the @xmath247 s either in the unflavoured ( for @xmath290 ) or in the two fully flavoured regime ( for @xmath291 ) .",
    "these scenarios have some particularly attractive features and correspond to a flavoured @xmath247-dominated scenario @xcite ( it corresponds to the mass patterns ( e ) , ( f ) and ( g ) in fig .  6 ) .    while within the unflavoured approximation , assumed in the vanilla scenario , the wash - out from @xmath208 yields a global exponential wash - out factor ( cf . eq .  ( [ n1washunfl ] ) ) , when lepton flavour effects are taken into account the asymmetry produced by the @xmath247 s , at the @xmath208 wash - out , distributes into an incoherent mixture of lepton flavour quantum eigenstates .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath208 wash - out in one of the three flavours is negligible , corresponding to have at least one @xmath292 , in quite a wide region of the parameter space @xcite . in this way , accounting for flavour effects , the region of applicability of the @xmath247-dominated scenario enlarges considerably , since it is not necessary that @xmath208 fully decouples but it is sufficient that it decouples just in a specific lepton flavour .",
    "recently , it has also been realised that , accounting for the higgs and for the quark asymmetries , the dynamics of the flavour asymmetries couple and the lightest rh neutrino wash - out in a particular flavour can be circumvented even when @xmath208 is strongly coupled in that flavour @xcite .",
    "another interesting effect arising in the @xmath247-dominated scenario is _",
    "phantom leptogenesis_. this is a pure quantum - mechanical effect originating from the fact that parts of the flavoured asymmetries , the phantom terms , escape completely the wash - out at the production .",
    "these terms are proportional to the initial @xmath247-abundance and , therefore , introduce an additional dependence on the initial abundance of the rh neutrinos .",
    "more generally , it has been recently shown that phantom terms associated to a rh neutrino species @xmath145 with @xmath293 are non - vanishing if the initial @xmath145 abundance is non - vanishing .",
    "however , the phantom terms produced by the lightest rh neutrinos cancel with each other and do not contribute to the final total asymmetry though they can contribute to the flavoured asymmetries and could have potential applications , for example , in active - sterile neutrino oscillations in the early universe @xcite .      even assuming a strong rh neutrino mass hierarchy , a coupled @xmath208 and @xmath294 ( it corresponds to the first panel in fig .",
    "6 ) , the asymmetry produced by the heavier rh neutrino decays , in particular by the @xmath247 s decays , can be sizeable and in general is not completely washed - out by the lightest rh neutrino processes .",
    "this is because there is in general an ( orthogonal ) component that escapes the @xmath208 wash - out @xcite while the remaining ( parallel ) component undergoes the usual exponential wash - out . for a mild mass hierarchy , @xmath295 , even the asymmetry produced by the @xmath253 s decays can be sizeable and circumvent the @xmath208 and @xmath247 wash - out .    due to this effect of heavy neutrino flavour projection and because of an additional contribution to the flavoured @xmath0 asymmetries @xmath296 , that is independent of the heaviest rh neutrino mass @xmath297 and that is not suppressed in the hierarchical limit , it has been recently noticed that , when lepton flavour effects are consistently taken into account , the contribution from the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos can be dominant even in an effective two rh neutrino model with @xmath298 @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , within an unflavoured description , as in the vanilla scenario , the problem of the dependence on the initial conditions reduces just to satisfy the strong washout condition @xmath221 . in other words",
    "there is a full correspondence between strong wash - out and independence of the initial conditions .",
    "when ( lepton and heavy neutrino ) flavour effects are considered , the situation is much more involved and for example imposing strong wash - out conditions on all flavoured asymmetries ( @xmath299 ) is not enough to guarantee independence of the initial conditions .",
    "perhaps the most striking consequence is that in a traditional @xmath208-dominated scenario there is no condition that can guarantee independence of the initial conditions .",
    "the only possibility to have independence of the initial conditions is represented by a tauon @xmath247-dominated scenario @xcite , that means a scenario where the asymmetry is dominantly produced from the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos , implying @xmath300 , in the tauon flavour .",
    "the condition @xmath289 is also important to have a projection of the quantum lepton states on the orthonormal three lepton flavour basis prior to the lightest rh neutrino wash - out .      as in the case of the @xmath208-dominated scenario ,",
    "a density matrix formalism allows to extend the calculation of the final asymmetry when the rh neutrino masses fall in one of the two transition regimes between two fully flavoured regimes . in this way , with a density matrix equation , the calculation of the final asymmetry can be performed for a generic choice of the three rh neutrino masses .",
    "moreover within a density matrix formalism , the validity of the multi - stage boltzmann equations describing the ten asymptotic limits shown in fig .",
    "6 , including the presence of phantom terms and the flavour projection effect , is fully confirmed @xcite .",
    "the see - saw mechanism extends the sm introducing eighteen new parameters when three rh neutrinos are added . on the other hand ,",
    "low energy neutrino experiments can only potentially test nine parameters in the neutrino mass matrix @xmath122 .",
    "nine high energy parameters , those characterising the properties of the three rh neutrinos ( three masses and six parameters in the see - saw orthogonal matrix @xmath128 introduced in the eq .",
    "( [ orthogonal ] ) encoding the three life times and the three total @xmath0 asymmetries ) , are not tested by low energy neutrino experiments .",
    "quite interestingly , the requirement of successful leptogenesis , _",
    "b^lep(m_,,m_i)=_b^cmb , provides an additional constraint on a combination of both low energy neutrino parameters and high energy neutrino parameters .",
    "however , just one additional constraint does not seem to be still sufficient to over - constraint the parameter space leading to testable predictions .",
    "despite this , as we have seen , in the vanilla leptogenesis scenario there is an upper bound on the neutrino masses .",
    "the reason is that in this case @xmath44 does not depend on the 6 parameters related to the properties of the two heavier rh neutrinos so that the asymmetry depends on a reduced subset of high energy parameters ( just three instead of nine ) . at the same time , the final asymmetry gets strongly suppressed by the absolute neutrino mass scale when this is larger than the atmospheric neutrino mass scale .",
    "this is why imposing successful leptogenesis yields an upper bound on the neutrino masses .",
    "when flavour effects are considered , the vanilla leptogenesis scenario holds only under very special conditions .",
    "more generally the parameters in the leptonic mixing matrix also directly affect the final asymmetry and , accounting for flavour effects , one could hope to derive definite predictions on the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "however , when flavour effects are taken into account , the final asymmetry depends , in general , also on the 6 parameters associated to the two heavier rh neutrinos that were canceling out in the calculation of the final asymmetry in the vanilla scenario , at the expenses of predictability . for this reason , in a general scenario with three rh neutrinos ,",
    "it is not possible to derive any prediction on low energy neutrino parameters .",
    "an upper bound @xmath301 on neutrino masses is still found but only within the regime of applicability of the classical boltzmann equations @xcite .",
    "this could somehow get relaxed within a more general density matrix approach @xcite .    in order to gain predictive power ,",
    "two possibilities have been explored in the last years .",
    "a first one is to consider non minimal scenarios giving rise to additional phenomenological constraints .",
    "for example , we have already mentioned how with a non minimal see - saw mechanism it is possible to lower the leptogenesis scale and have signatures at colliders .",
    "it has also been noticed that in supersymmetric models one can enhance the branching ratios of lepton flavour violating processes or electric dipole moments and in this way the existing experimental bounds further constrain the see - saw parameter space @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is to search again , as for vanilla leptogenesis , for a reasonable scenario where the final asymmetry depends on a reduced number of independent parameters over - constrained by the successful leptogenesis bound .",
    "let us briefly discuss some of the main ideas that have been proposed in this second respect .",
    "a well motivated scenario that attracted great attention is a two rh neutrino model @xcite , where the third rh neutrino is either absent or effectively decoupled from the see - saw mechanism .",
    "this necessarily happens when @xmath302 , implying that the lightest left - handed neutrino mass @xmath78 has to vanish .",
    "it can be shown that the number of parameters gets reduced from 18 to 11 .",
    "the two rh neutrino model has been traditionally considered as a sort of benchmark case for the @xmath208-dominated scenario , where the final asymmetry is dominated by the contribution from the lightest rh neutrinos .",
    "however recently @xcite , as we anticipated already , it has been shown that there are some regions in the high energy parameter space ( basically one complex angle ) that are @xmath247-dominated .",
    "even though in this model there is still a lower bound on @xmath134 , contrarily to the @xmath247 dominated scenario with three rh neutrinos , in these new @xmath247-dominated regions the lower bound on @xmath134 is relaxed by one order of magnitude , down to about @xmath303 . interestingly these regions correspond to so called light sequential dominated models @xcite .",
    "it should be said that in a general 2 rh neutrino model it is still not possible to make predictions on the low energy neutrino parameters . to this extent",
    "one should further reduce the parameter space for example assuming texture zeros in the neutrino dirac mass matrix .      in order to gain predictive power , one can impose conditions within some model of new physics embedding the see - saw mechanism .",
    "an interesting example is represented by the ` @xmath108-inspired scenario ' @xcite , where @xmath108-inspired conditions are imposed on the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath113 . in the basis where the charged leptons mass matrix and the majorana mass matrix are diagonal ,",
    "one can write in the bi - unitary parametrisation @xmath304 , where @xmath305 is the diagonalised neutrino dirac mass matrix . in @xmath108-inspired models , the unitary matrix @xmath306 is related and not too different from the so called cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix @xmath307 .",
    "the @xmath308 can then be calculated from @xmath306 , @xmath61 and @xmath30 , considering that , as it can be seen from the see - saw formula eq .",
    "( [ see - saw ] ) , it provides a takagi factorisation of @xmath309 , or explicitly @xmath310 .",
    "moreover the three eigenvalues @xmath311 are assumed to be order - of - magnitude wise equal to the three up quark masses .    in this way",
    "the rh neutrino masses and the matrix @xmath308 are expressed in terms of the low energy neutrino parameters , of the eigenvalues @xmath312 of @xmath113 and of the parameters in @xmath306 . since one has typically @xmath313 and @xmath314 , the asymmetry produced from the lightest rh neutrino decays is negligible and",
    "the @xmath247-dominated scenario is realised @xcite . imposing the leptogenesis bound and considering that the final asymmetry does not depend on @xmath315 and on @xmath316 , one obtains constraints on all low energy neutrino parameters slightly depending just on the parameter @xmath317 typically parameterised in terms of @xmath318 , where @xmath319 is the charm quark mass .",
    "some examples of the constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters are shown in fig .",
    "7 for a scan over the @xmath320 ranges of the allowed values of the low energy parameters and over the parameters in @xmath306 assumed to be @xmath321 @xcite and for three values of @xmath322 .",
    "this scenario has been also extended including a type ii contribution to the see - saw mechanism usually arising in left - right symmetric models @xcite .",
    "+      an account of heavy neutrino flavour effects is important when leptogenesis is embedded within theories that try to explain tribimaximal mixing for the leptonic mixing matrix via flavour symmetries .",
    "it has been shown in particular that if the symmetry is unbroken then the @xmath0 asymmetries of the rh neutrinos would exactly vanish since the basis of the three heavy neutrino flavours would be exactly orthonormal .",
    "on the other hand when the symmetry is broken , for the naturally expected values of the symmetry breaking parameters , then the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry can be successfully reproduced @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that in a minimal picture based on a @xmath323 symmetry - symmetry is then equivalent to impose that the lagrangian of the new model extending the sm , is invariant under transformations of the @xmath323 group acting on the flavour space .",
    "] , one has a rh neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath324 .",
    "one has therefore that all the asymmetry is produced in the unflavoured regime and that the mass spectrum is only mildly hierarchical ( it has actually the same kind of hierarchy of light neutrinos ) . at the same time the small symmetry breaking implies corresponds to quasi - orthonormality of the three lepton quantum states produced in the rh",
    "neutrino decays . under these conditions",
    "the wash - out of the asymmetry produced by one rh neutrino species from the inverse decays of a lighter rh neutrino species is essentially negligible .",
    "the final asymmetry then receives a non negligible contribution from the decays of all three rh neutrinos species .      within a supersymmetric framework",
    "the final asymmetry calculated in the vanilla leptogenesis scenario undergoes minor changes @xcite .",
    "however , supersymmetry introduces a conceptual important issue : the stringent lower bound on the reheat temperature , @xmath325 , is typically marginally compatible with an upper bound from the avoidance of the so called gravitino problem @xmath326 , with the exact value depending on the parameters of the model @xcite .",
    "( the exact value depending on many of the new supersymmetric parameters ) the supersymmetric partners of gravitons , so called gravitinos , would be produced in a way either to yield a matter energy density parameter @xmath327 much above the observed value or to spoil the predictions of standard big bang nucleosynthesis , the model that , within the hot big bang models , successfully reproduces the measured values of the primordial nuclear abundances .",
    "for this reason , within these models , an upper bound @xmath326 has to be imposed .",
    "] it is quite remarkable that the solution of such a issue inspired an intense research activity on supersymmetric models able to reconcile minimal leptogenesis and the gravitino problem .",
    "of course on the leptogenesis side , some of the discussed extensions beyond the vanilla scenario that relax the neutrino mass bounds also relax the @xmath235 lower bound .",
    "however , notice that in the @xmath247 dominated scenario , while the lower bound on @xmath134 simply disappears , there is still a lower bound on @xmath235 that is even more stringent , @xmath328 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned already , with flavour effects one has the possibility to relax the lower bound on @xmath235 if a mild hierarchy in the rh neutrino masses is allowed together with a mild cancellation in the see - saw formula @xcite .",
    "however for most models , such as sequential dominated models @xcite , this solution does not apply .",
    "a major modification introduced by supersymmetry is that the critical value of the mass of the decaying rh neutrinos setting the transition from an unflavoured regime to a two - flavour regime and from a two - flavour regime to a three flavour regime is enhanced by a factor @xmath329 @xcite .",
    "this has a practical relevance in the calculation of the asymmetry within supersymmetric models and it is quite interesting that leptogenesis becomes sensitive to such a relevant supersymmetric parameter .",
    "in 2011 two important experimental results have been announced that , if confirmed , can be interpreted as quite important toward the possibility of a positive test of leptogenesis .",
    "the first result is the strong hint of a non - vanishing @xmath330 from t2k results first and then confirmed by many other experiments at more than @xmath331 standard deviations @xcite .",
    "very interestingly , such a value is sufficiently large to open realistically the possibility of a measurement of the neutrino oscillation @xmath0 violating invariant @xmath332 during next years .",
    "if this measurement will give a non - vanishing result , this will have some direct model independent important consequences .",
    "first of all , even the small contribution to the final asymmetry uniquely stemming from a dirac phase could be sufficient to reproduce the observed final asymmetry @xcite . in any case , the presence of @xmath0 violation at low energies would certainly support also the presence of @xmath0 violation at high energies , since given a generic theoretical model predicting the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath113 , these are in general both present .",
    "however , there is an even more important practical relevance of such a measurement , even if in the end this will indicate a vanishing value of @xmath333 within the experimental error .",
    "the reason is that such a measurement of @xmath333 will provide an additional constraint in specific see - saw models able to produce simultaneous predictions on the low energy neutrino parameters and on the final asymmetry in leptogenesis .",
    "the interesting case of @xmath108-inspired leptogenesis offers a definite example . by plugging more and more information from low energy neutrino experiments",
    ", we will be able more and more strongly to test the models .    at the same time",
    "the hint of a @xmath334 higgs boson reported by the atlas and cms collaborations can be also interpreted as a positive result for leptogenesis .",
    "first of all because leptogenesis relies on the higgs mechanism and second because the measurement of the higgs boson mass could in future open new opportunities for additional phenomenological information to be imposed on leptogenesis scenarios for example relying on the requirement of vacuum stability @xcite .",
    "what are other possible future experimental developments that could be important for testing leptogenesis ?",
    "an improved information from absolute neutrino mass scale experiments , both on the sum of the neutrino masses from cosmology and on @xmath335 from @xmath336 experiments could be crucial especially if these phenomenologies will definitively confirm the upper bound @xmath337 but at the same time will detect a positive signal @xmath338 , within the reach of future experiments in next 5 - 10 years . in this case",
    "the a desirable leptogenesis neutrino mass window @xmath339 would be confirmed .",
    "still need to be confirmed within a density matrix formalism and , therefore , a result @xmath340 would be , if not a necessity , a safe finding and certainly desirable . for @xmath341 the strong thermal condition ( independence of the initial conditions ) would necessarily hold in the vanilla scenario . even though , including flavour effects additional conditions need to be imposed to realise strong thermal leptogenesis , still , if @xmath341 will be found , it would be much more natural to satisfy them .",
    "for these reasons the window @xmath339 can still be regarded as a desirable window for the absolute neutrino mass scale in leptogenesis .",
    "] at the same time it is likely that a measurement of the neutrino mass ordering will be possible when the information from absolute neutrino mass scale experiments is combined with neutrino oscillation experiments . moreover , with a large @xmath342 value , even just neutrino oscillation experiments could be sufficient to determine the mass ordering within next years . in this case a precise measurement of the allowed region in the plane @xmath343 would provide a positive test of specific leptogenesis scenarios , such as @xmath108-inspired leptogenesis , especially when a condition of independence of the initial conditions is imposed @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite exciting that even just the expected new information from ( in most cases already data taking ) low energy neutrino experiments will be able to test models of leptogenesis in a substantial way during next years . in conclusion , with leptogenesis , we have the fascinating opportunity to probe at the same time both a new stage in the early universe history in cosmology and physics beyond the sm .",
