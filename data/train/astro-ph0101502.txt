    "flat - spectrum radio quasars are known to be dominated in the radio spectrum by synchrotron emission .",
    "it is less clear how far these synchrotron spectra extend towards higher frequencies , or the magnitude of the contribution they make to the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectrum  a region dominated by the big blue bump .",
    "the far - ir emission of flat - spectrum quasars appears to be dominated by synchrotron emission @xcite , consistent with a doppler - boosted component that swamps the expected emission from dust components .",
    "synchrotron emission in the optical has been considered for many years to be necessary to explain the optical to nir photometry of optically faint and red flat - spectrum radio quasars .",
    "this has mostly been on the basis of the steepness of the optical ",
    "nir spectra @xcite .",
    "the steepness of these spectra suggested a cutoff , or sharp break , in the electron energy spectrum . supporting evidence for",
    "the presence of synchrotron emission at nir wavelengths comes from both the variability in the nir , and from the strong polarisation of a few sources .",
    "stickel et al .",
    "found that variability was a general characteristic of optically faint flat - spectrum radio sources , although they did not specifically discuss synchrotron emission .",
    "instead , they suggest that reddening due to intervening galaxies or the host galaxy itself was the likely cause of the red optical colours .    while radio jets are quite common , and have been widely observed , optical counterparts to these jets are quite rare .",
    "in fact , only 14 optical jets are currently known ( see odea et al .   and references therein ) .",
    "the features ( i.e.  emission knots ) in the optical jets match the positions of features in the radio jets , indicating that the emission regions and mechanisms for the two spectral regimes are associated .",
    "optical jets can be used to put strong constraints on the particle energetics , by providing limits on the maximum energies , and on the acceleration mechanisms , due to the short lifetimes of particles at these energies @xcite .",
    "the quasars considered in this paper are selected from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs ) @xcite , which consists of 323 objects selected to be radio - loud ( @xmath2 ) , and have a flat radio spectrum ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "these quasars have been shown @xcite to have a large spread in @xmath5 colours , with the reddest objects having @xmath6 .",
    "masci , webster & francis showed that this spread could not be accounted for by the emission from the host - galaxy .",
    "in this paper we test the idea that optical synchrotron emission causes the red optical - nir colours of the phfs quasars .",
    "models representing emission from both an optical synchrotron component and a blue optical power law ( representing the continuum emission from an unreddened quasar ) are fitted to broad - band optical - nir spectra .",
    "standard goodness - of - fit techniques are used to determine models which are consistent with the observations .",

    "the source selection used for this paper is explained in section  [ sec - data ] .",
    "the simultaneity , as well as the breadth and density of the spectral coverage of this dataset provides an excellent basis to model the broadband emission from a large number of flat - spectrum quasars .",

    "the effect of emission lines on the photometry and the resulting fits is investigated in section  [ sec - em - effect ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec - discuss ] contains discussion of the results and their implications .",
    "the data which have been fitted by these models are described in detail in fww .",
    "a total of 157 sources from the phfs were observed , with quasi - simultaneous broadband photometry observations in the bands @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these magnitudes were converted into broadband fluxes using the zero points given in the same paper .",
    "not all sources in fww were used .",
    "firstly , we only considered those sources with complete contemporaneous photometry in all bands , or those with only one observation missing ( either not observed or an upper limit ) .",
    "this was to ensure that the number of degrees of freedom in the model fitting was greater than zero .",
    "those sources with more than one band missing were not included in the analysis .",
    "sources without a measured redshift were also excluded , since the redshift is needed to obtain the correct shape of the observed synchrotron spectrum .",
    "one of the sources that had an unknown redshift ( @xmath14 ) in drinkwater et al .",
    ", 0829@xmath15046 , has a published redshift value of @xmath16 @xcite , which is used here .",
    "also excluded were low redshift galaxies , which had a prominent 4000  break between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands .",
    "these sources show strong evidence for flux from the underlying galaxy in their spectra @xcite , and thus need an additional galactic component to be modelled accurately .",
    "sources with @xmath17 were also excluded , as these had strong ly@xmath18 breaks present between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this reduced the number of sources from 157 to 117 .",
    "twenty - one of the reddest sources ( @xmath19 ) in the subsample were amongst those excluded , as they have only upper limits on @xmath7 , @xmath8 and possibly @xmath9 , or no redshift .",
    "the sources with upper limits are both red and optically faint .",
    "since the flux of these sources typically decreases rapidly in the blue ( i.e.  from @xmath8 to @xmath7 ) , there are three possible explanations for them .",
    "they are either dust - reddened ( causing the blue decrease in flux ) , high redshift ( and hence ly@xmath18  absorbed ) , or they are dominated by synchrotron that turns over rapidly .",
    "future analysis of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these sources will only strengthen our final conclusions .",
    "those sources excluded purely because of their lack of measured redshift generally have high @xmath5 colours ( @xmath20 ) , since the most likely reason they have no redshift is that they are faint in the optical ( and in particular in the blue ) .",
    "further discussion of the sources excluded from the sample is given in section  [ sec - discuss ] .",
    "the photometry given in fww quoted error bars , where the estimated error comprised two parts : a random error component and an assumed 5% error in the photometric zero points , which were added together in quadrature .",
    "the photometric zero point errors were estimated from the scatter in zero points between different standard star measurements in an individual night : francis et al .  adopted a value of 5% to account for this error .    however",
    ", this zero point error ignores a number of factors that we believe may be important for the analysis in this paper .",
    "these factors are as follows :    * the optical zero magnitude fluxes were taken from bessell , castelli & plez . these fluxes were derived for an a0 star , and so will be slightly incorrect for a quasar spectrum .",
    "this has the effect of introducing small colour terms into the photometry , the size of which will depend on the spectral index of the object being observed .",
    "a similar effect will of course be present in the nir .",
    "bersanelli , bouchet & falomo found that spectral shape differences could produce systematic errors of at least a few percent in the nir flux .",
    "* the zero point fluxes in the optical are taken from a different reference @xcite to those in the nir , which were calculated by p.mcgregor ( _ caspir _ manual , mssso , anu ) , assuming that vega is well represented in the nir by a black body of temperature 11200 k , and normalisation @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these different zero points may not be exactly equivalent , which will produce small offsets between the optical and nir parts of the sed .",
    "* if the sky conditions at siding spring observatory were not completely photometric for all observations for a given source ( particularly if the transparency changed between different bands ) , then the measured photometry will have small band - to - band errors present . *",
    "the observations for each source were taken quasi - simultaneously ( meaning all observations were made within at most a six - day period ) , to minimise the effects of variability .",
    "however , a number of the sources in the phfs have been found to exhibit intra - day variability in the optical @xcite , and a larger number no doubt have similar properties to these .",
    "therefore , variability on timescales of the order of those separating our observations is likely for some of the sources .",
    "such variability can be up to 0.1 mag over the period of a night .",
    "* finally , the presence of strong emission lines in the quasars spectra could boost the flux of a band above the level of the continuum .",
    "we have tried to quantify this effect in section  [ sec - em - effect ] , although this is not possible to do for many sources , due to the lack of both photometry and a spectrum .",
    "some additional effects may be due to line blends ( such as  blends ) , but this is probably not as strong an effect as you would find in a radio - quiet sample .",
    "hence , to take account of all these factors , we have increased the systematic error in the photometry to 10% .",
    "the random error is kept at the same level as that presented in fww , and is added in quadrature to the systematic error .",
    "the object of our analysis is to find physical models to explain the optical and nir emission .",
    "fww found that about 90% of the phfs have approximately power law seds .",
    "we first wish to test this more rigorously . as a starting point , we choose to fit ( naively ) a simple power law , with an unconstrained spectral index .",
    "this will separate out the sources that have power law seds from those that show some curvature in their spectrum .",
    "the model we choose to fit is @xmath22 , so that the normalisation @xmath23 and the spectral index @xmath18 vary .",
    "( note that this model implies @xmath24 . )",
    "this model is fit to the data using a least - squares method .",
    "this generates a @xmath25 value : @xmath26 which indicates the goodness of fit .",
    "a fit to a source will be deemed to be `` good '' when the value of @xmath25 is less than the cut - off value corresponding to the 99% confidence level of the @xmath25 distribution . for a source with 5 degrees of freedom ( as is the case for most sources with this power law model ) , this cutoff level is 15.09 .",
    "( note that increasing the value of this cutoff is equivalent to increasing the confidence level  for example , the 99.5% cutoff is 16.75 for 5 degrees of freedom . )",
    "if the @xmath25 value is greater than this cutoff level , then we reject the null hypothesis that the power law model fits the data .",
    "when we fit this power law model to the data , we find that 83 sources ( or 71% of the total ) have good fits .",
    "the distribution of resulting power law indices , both for the good fits and for all sources , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - index - xray ] .",
    "the spectral indices of these good fits span a wide range of values . at one extreme",
    "there are the sources with relatively blue seds ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "these sources are characterised by their blue continuum , the presence of moderate to strong emission lines , and generally low x - ray flux ( most were not detected by _ rosat _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "at the other extreme are the sources with redder seds ( that is , flatter in @xmath28 ) , with @xmath29 .",
    "these sources are blazar type objects , with high optical polarisation @xcite as well as relatively weak ( or even absent ) emission lines  in fact , all the bl lac objects in our sample are in this region .",
    "so , we have fit a power law to a large majority of the sources in our sample , spanning a wide range of spectral indices .",
    "are the physical processes that generate this power law the same for all sources ?",
    "that is , does the power law in the blue sources have the same origin as that in the red sources ?    the first class of sources  the blue sources  are being fit by a blue power law , which has similar colours to the blue power law emission seen in optically - selected quasars @xcite .",
    "this is likely to be the optical part of the continuum emission from the accretion disk ( often termed the big blue bump ) .",
    "however , the power law being fit to the redder sources is most likely of different origin to that seen in the blue sources .",
    "these objects exhibit characteristics commonly associated with optical synchrotron emission ( such as high optical polarisation and lack of prominent emission lines ) , and so we postulate that this emission is , at least in part , some form of synchrotron emission .",
    "the slope of the power law can then be used to determine @xmath30 , the power law index of the electron energy distribution ( i.e.  defined such that @xmath31 : see section  [ sec - synch ] ) . using the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - index - xray ] , we obtain @xmath32 ( using @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "if synchrotron emission is present in the spectra of at least some of these quasars , then we can ask the question `` is the synchrotron component best modelled by this power law ? '' the synchrotron component will be present in one of two forms : a power law caused by an unbroken ( power law ) electron energy distribution , or a turning - over component caused by a break or a cut - off in the electron energy distribution . (",
    "note that the power law can also be produced by a synchrotron spectrum turning over at higher frequencies than those observed . )    both of these forms can be tested .",
    "the power law model must produce power law indices that are consistent with slopes of plausible energy distributions .",
    "the presence or otherwise of a turnover can be evaluated by examining the sharpest possible turnover ( caused by an abrupt cut - off in the energy distribution at some maximum energy ) .",
    "this will provide the maximum contrast with the power law , and is consistent with modeling done by other authors ( * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "many of the sources , while they have power law fits that we can not reject at the 99% confidence level , show evidence for curvature in their seds . this curvature can be ` n'-shaped ( higher in the middle than at either end ) , ` u'-shaped ( lower in the middle ) or perhaps take the form of an inflection ( e.g.  the flux decreases , levels off and decreases again ) .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ex ] for illustrations of the different types . )",
    "most of the sources classed as bl lac objects are ` n'-shaped , and so we postulate that these sources are dominated by a synchrotron component that is turning over in the optical .",
    "other sources , however , are bluer in the optical than in the nir ( i.e.  show an inflection , without the turn - up seen in ` u'-shaped sources ) .",
    "this is a possible indication of the presence of excess emission in the nir , in addition to a blue power law .",
    "we propose that this excess emission is due to a synchrotron component that has turned over in the nir , and so does not dominate in the optical , where the dominant emission is instead a blue power law similar to that observed in the bluest sources .",
    "in response to this phenomenological classification , we propose the following physical model . there are two components in this model :",
    "one is a blue power law , representing continuum emission from the accretion disk region ; and the second is synchrotron emission , representing emission from the relativistic jet ( that we know to be present due to the flat - spectrum radio emission seen in these objects ) .",
    "we find , from the simple power law fitting , that the bluest sources have power law continua .",
    "the slopes of these power laws are consistent with them being the same component as that seen in optically - selected quasars , commonly termed the `` big blue bump '' ( bbb ) .",
    "we take this component to represent the underlying quasar continuum in the uv - optical part of the rest - frame spectrum  that is , the `` un - reddened ''",
    "quasar continuum .    over the wavelength of our observations ,",
    "the bbb is modelled as a simple power law , @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "francis found the median slope for a subsample of quasars from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) , taken from optical / nir photometry , was @xmath37 , and noted that the observations were consistent with an intrinsic continuum slope of @xmath38 that is reddened by various amounts of dust .",
    "we therefore take our value of @xmath39 to be @xmath40 .",
    "the effects of allowing the value of @xmath39 to vary are considered in section  [ sec - discuss ] .",
    "all the phfs sources are radio - loud flat - spectrum sources , and thus very likely have relativistic jets that emit synchrotron radiation , at least at radio frequencies .",
    "could this synchrotron emission extend up to the optical / nir part of the spectrum ?",
    "our power law fitting from the previous section provides circumstantial evidence for this : the redder sources in the optical tend to be the ones with higher polarisation ( a good sign of synchrotron emission ) and less prominent emission lines ( possibly a sign that the emission lines are being swamped by the presence of a synchrotron component ) .",
    "these pieces of evidence are investigated more deeply in section  [ sec - tests ] .    as discussed above",
    ", the synchrotron spectrum could take the form of either a power law , from a power law distribution of electron energies , or a power law with a break or turn - over , due to an electron energy distribution that exhibits a break or even a cut - off .",
    "this latter type of spectrum has been seen in optical synchrotron jets @xcite , where the optical spectrum is like @xmath41@xmath42 , compared to a radio  optical spectrum of @xmath43@xmath44 .",
    "additionally , a synchrotron spectrum that has a turn - over will , when combined with the blue power law , be able to reproduce an inflection - like sed .",
    "such a spectrum , particularly in the region of the turn - over , will also be quite red , thus accounting for the red colours of many of the seds .",
    "we consider here synchrotron emission from a population of electrons with an energy distribution with the form of a power law up to some maximum energy and zero beyond this ( i.e.  an energy spectrum with an abrupt cutoff ) .",
    "this can be expressed as a distribution of the lorentz factor @xmath45 of the radiating electrons : @xmath46    this is consistent with modelling done by meisenheimer et al . on the jet of m87 .",
    "they found that the overall synchrotron spectrum of the brightest parts of the jet was best described by a spectrum that had a sharp cutoff at @xmath47 , with an energy distribution of the form of a straight power law @xmath48 , with a rather abrupt high energy cutoff .",
    "we consider the effect of using a power law synchrotron spectrum instead in section  [ sec - discuss ] .",
    "such a synchrotron spectrum is straightforward to model analytically .",
    "we use the `` classical '' synchrotron model , as first calculated by schwinger , and as derived by a number of authors , particularly pacholczyk and longair , whose derivation we follow .",
    "the single particle luminosity for a radiating electron ( mass @xmath49 , charge @xmath50 , lorentz factor @xmath51 , and pitch angle , or angle between trajectory and magnetic field direction , @xmath52 ) in a uniform magnetic field @xmath7 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the angular frequency , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is defined in terms of the bessel function @xmath57 by @xmath58    we are interested in the luminosity of a population of particles , so we need to integrate @xmath59 over suitable distributions of energies and pitch angles .",
    "the energy distribution is that given above , while the pitch angle distribution that we use is an isotropic one , where the probability distribution is @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the integrated luminosity from such a population is @xmath61    an example of such a spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - synch ] , for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( the value of @xmath64 has been taken to be 1 ) .",
    "the peak frequency @xmath65 depends on these two values , and can be shown by simple arguments @xcite to be approximated by @xmath66 ( where @xmath7 is measured in gauss ) .",
    "the slope of the power law tail ( at frequencies @xmath67 ) is related to the energy power law index by @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 ) .",
    "the energy distribution for the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig - synch ] is taken to be @xmath70 ( i.e.  @xmath71 ) , giving a power law of @xmath72 .",
    "we consider here a range of @xmath30 values from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , which gives a range of long - wavelength power law slopes of @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "this range covers the distribution of radio - to - optical slopes observed in optical synchrotron jets @xcite .",
    "allowing @xmath30 to vary does not significantly alter the results of our analysis  see section  [ sec - discuss ] for further discussion .",
    "we also note here that a value of @xmath77 means that the @xmath78 flux will increase towards longer wavelengths ( since @xmath79 and so @xmath80 ) and this results in the radio flux being severely overestimated by the fitted synchrotron component , since the radio emission always has a lower @xmath81 flux than the optical .",
    "( this assumes that the same synchrotron component is responsible for both the optical and radio emission , which is an assumption commonly made , particularly for the modelling of optical synchrotron jets @xcite . )      these two components ( the blue power law and the synchrotron component ) are combined linearly to form a model @xmath82 that is fit to the data in the same way as the power law model ( that is , using @xmath25 minimisation ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath25 value ( that is , @xmath83 ) for each of the two models ( combined and power law ) are compared , and the model with the lowest @xmath83 is chosen to be the best fit model .    in fitting the combined model ,",
    "the location of the peak wavelength of the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath84 , was allowed to vary .",
    "this variation was allowed to occur over a range of rest frame wavelengths such that the curvature of the spectrum caused by the turn - over affected the synchrotron flux in the region of the data points ( in other words , we did not want to just be fitting the power law part of the synchrotron spectrum ) .",
    "quantitatively , we took the minimum peak wavelength to be half a decade shorter than the @xmath7 band ( @xmath85 ) shifted to the rest frame .",
    "we then considered 20 @xmath84 values per decade ( evenly spaced in @xmath86 ) , up to a maximum peak of @xmath87 .",
    "for each of these synchrotron functions , a best fit to the data was found , and then the best of these was chosen , giving the best fit @xmath84 value for that source .",
    "this combined model was fitted to the photometry , and compared to the power law fits .",
    "the best fitting model was chosen on the basis of the lowest reduced @xmath25 value , as described above .",
    "for the default values of the parameters ( @xmath71 and @xmath88 ) , we find that 93 sources ( or 79% of the total ) are well fit by one of the models . of these , 48 are best fit by the power law model , and 45 by the combined model .",
    "how these numbers change with different parameter values is discussed in section  [ sec - param ] .",
    "a selection of the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ex ] , for a range of power law slopes and synchrotron peak wavelengths .",
    "we note here that although there are 48 sources best fit by the power law model , many of these have combined fits that are only slightly worse than the power law fit .",
    "this indicates that there is not a great deal of difference between the fits of the two models .",
    "this is not the case with the combined model sources , as for most of these the combined model fit is a lot better than the power law fit .",
    "a histogram of @xmath83 values is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - chisq ] , with the distributions for the two different models shown separately .",
    "the distribution for the sources best fit by the combined model is noticeably broader than that for the power law sources , with more sources having very low @xmath25 values .",
    "while many sources have been fitted better with the combined model , a large number are still preferentially fit with the power law .",
    "if we plot a histogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ihist ] ) of the power law indices of those still fit by the power law model , we can see that those sources that are preferentially fit by the power law model are the bluer sources , while the majority of the sources with indices @xmath89 are fit better by the combined model .",
    "the properties of the synchrotron components that are fitted as part of the combined model are of particular interest .",
    "as can be seen in fig  [ fig - peak ] , the peak wavelengths are restricted to a relatively narrow range of values ( approximately a decade in wavelength ) . however ,",
    "this is likely to be largely a reflection of the distribution of the wavelengths of the photometric points .",
    "the strength of the fitted synchrotron component varies considerably from source to source . in fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio ] , the ratio of the synchrotron and power law components at a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath90 is shown for all sources best fit by the combined model .",
    "the main bulk of this distribution spans nearly four orders of magnitude .",
    "this large range of values , which is also seen in the normalisations of the individual components , indicates that we are seeing a continuum of variations of these components , probably due to variations in the strengths of the inner jet and emission from the accretion disk and/or surrounding regions .",
    "we also note that a small number of the sources at the high - ratio end of the distribution are faint , red sources , that are likely to be significantly dust - reddened .",
    "they are thus fit with a dominant synchrotron component , as the synchrotron spectrum has the approximate form of a power law with an exponential cut - off ( which is the same as a power law with dust extinction ) .",
    "we have shown that a large fraction of the sources in the phfs show evidence for the presence of optical synchrotron emission , where the amount of synchrotron emission present in the spectrum changes with wavelength . how else can we test this model ?",
    "one of the key features of synchrotron radiation is its high degree of polarisation .",
    "if there is significant synchrotron emission at optical and nir wavelengths , then one would expect to be able to detect a corresponding polarisation .",
    "indeed , this has been used as a way to confirm the presence of synchrotron emission in optical jets ( baade provided the first example of this for the jet of m87 . )    in our combined model , the synchrotron component is the only polarised component , as we assume that the bbb component , which is essentially emission from the accretion disk , is unpolarised ( @xmath91 for the bbb @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the amount of polarisation will depend on the proportion of the total flux that is due to the synchrotron emission .",
    "furthermore , if the relative amount of synchrotron emission changes with wavelength , as it does with the models we have fitted , then the amount of polarisation should also change with wavelength .",
    "such dependencies have been investigated previously by a number of different authors , for samples that include some sources considered here .",
    "wills et al .   studied a large sample of bright , flat - spectrum core - dominant quasars , measuring their optical polarisation .",
    "an interesting result is that they found that the fraction of quasars with @xmath92 in a fixed observed passband decreased with increasing @xmath93 , possibly indicating that the percentage polarisation decreases towards shorter rest frame wavelengths .",
    "this would be consistent with the presence of a synchrotron component turning over in the optical region .",
    "impey & tapia present radio and optical data for a slightly larger sample of radio - selected quasars , including optical polarisation measurements .",
    "they find strong statistical links between strong optical polarisation and properties such as compact radio structure , superluminal motion and weak emission lines .",
    "they explain this by requiring the optical emission , as well as the compact radio emission , to be relativistically beamed .",
    "smith et al .",
    "obtained multicolour ( @xmath94 ) polarisation measurements of 11 highly polarised quasars , and found that three of these exhibited decreasing polarisation toward shorter wavelengths , which they modelled as a combination of polarised synchrotron emission , and two unpolarised components , from the broad - line region and the accretion disk .",
    "none of these sources , however , are part of our sample .",
    "firstly , we wish to compare our model predictions with published optical polarisation measurements .",
    "we use the large catalogue of measurements compiled by wills et al .  .",
    "we want to compare these measurements with the fractional amount of flux due to the fitted synchrotron component . however , since the observations of wills et al .",
    "were made without a filter , we have determined the average synchrotron fraction by integrating over the range @xmath95  @xmath96 .",
    "we have then plotted in fig .",

    "for those sources that were best fit by the power law model , we have calculated the fraction from the combined model fit , and indicated these sources by a different symbol .",
    "all the power law sources with polarisation measurements had relatively red power law indices ( i.e.  @xmath97 ) .",
    "the spread in polarisation measurements at large synchrotron fractions is much greater than at low fractions , indicating that the high polarisation sources generally have large amounts of synchrotron fitted to them ( at the wavelengths at which the polarisation is measured ) .",
    "additionally , all but one of the sources at zero ( or near - zero ) synchrotron fraction have low optical polarisation .",
    "the two exceptions to this picture are 0202@xmath98172 and 1020@xmath98103 .",
    "firstly , 1020@xmath98103 has a very high synchrotron fraction ( @xmath99 ) , but has very little optical polarisation ( @xmath100 ) . in this case",
    ", the source has a power law continuum with a slight curvature , which is fit well by an almost pure synchrotron curve .",
    "it may be that this curvature is due to other effects than synchrotron , which explains the lack of polarisation .",
    "a possible candidate is contamination from the very strong h@xmath18line , which would boost the continuum level in the centre of the sed .",
    "secondly , 0202@xmath98172 has a measured polarisation of 5.15 , but also has a very blue power law continuum ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "this continuum slope is possibly too steep to attribute to synchrotron ( it implies a value of @xmath102  in turn implying a rather flat energy distribution ) .",
    "however , the location of the synchrotron peak may have shifted in the period since the polarisation measurements were made ( the polarisation measurements were taken 8 years prior to our photometry observations ) .      to try to avoid the problem of non - simultaneity of the photometry and polarisation observations",
    ", we obtained polarisation measurements of 8 quasars in the nir , using the _ iris _ instrument on the anglo australian telescope .",
    "the details and results of the observations will be presented elsewhere ( whiting et al .",

    "these measurements are nearly simultaneous with the photometry measurements ( a difference of @xmath103 days ) , and so can be directly related to the fitted components .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the polarisation can then provide an important test on the models we are fitting .    since the synchrotron component is the only polarised component",
    ", one would expect the percentage polarisation to be directly related to the amount of synchrotron flux present , and , in fact , the percentage polarisation will be directly proportional to the ratio of synchrotron flux to total flux . in fig .",
    "[ fig - mypol ] , we have plotted the polarisation of each of these quasars as a function of wavelength , and , on the same plot , the synchrotron ratio normalised ( arbitrarily , as it is the wavelength dependence we are interested in , not the precise normalisation ) to the longest wavelength polarisation point ( which is usually the @xmath13-band point ) . for completeness , we also show a line of constant polarisation , normalised to the @xmath13-band point .",
    "all these sources are best fit with the combined model , with the exception of 1101@xmath98325 , which is fit best by the power law model ( its sed taking the form of a blue power law , @xmath104 ) .",
    "we have used the combined model fit to it for the purposes of fig .",
    "[ fig - mypol ] .",
    "we have also included polarisation measurements from wills et al . where they exist .",
    "again , these are put at an observed wavelength of @xmath105 .",
    "note , of course , that these points are not simultaneous with the nir points .",
    "the fitted synchrotron component generally replicates well the wavelength dependence of the polarisation , although for some sources , such as 1313@xmath98333 , the points are equally well given by a constant polarisation component .",
    "this is what you would expect from a pure synchrotron component , and these sources are typically bl lac objects , from which you would expect to see a synchrotron - dominated sed .",
    "a notable exception to this is 0537@xmath98441 , whose polarisation is not fit well by a constant synchrotron component , but is fit better by a combination of a synchrotron and a significant power law component .",
    "however , it is apparent from these plots that having simultaneous optical polarisation measurements would better help discriminate between the combined model and a constant polarisation model .",
    "synchrotron flux emitted from the phfs quasars is most likely to come from a thin , relativistic jet , and the radiation will not be isotropic .",
    "this means that there will be very little synchrotron radiation directed towards the emission line clouds , which have a much larger covering angle .",
    "thus , the ionisation of these clouds will be due to the continuum emission from the central accretion disk region  in other words , the big blue bump .",
    "one might expect that adding a non - ionising synchrotron component to the continuum will have the effect of reducing the equivalent width of the emission lines from the blr , due to the fact that the flux in the emission lines is not changed but the continuum flux is increased .    to test this prediction , we compared the equivalent widths of five emission lines (  1549 ,  1909 ,  2798 , h@xmath106 , and the doublet  4959,5007 ) with the ratio of synchrotron to continuum flux at the line wavelength , to see if some form of an anti - correlation is present .",
    "the details of the observations will presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "objects that had spectra taken were essentially a random sample of the phfs ( subject to visibility during the observing run ) .    in fig",
    "[ fig - ew ] , we show the results of this comparison for the  and h@xmath106  lines , which are the two broad lines with the longest wavelength ( and hence the two lines most likely to show a reduction in equivalent width ) .",
    "we have also plotted those sources best fit with the power law model .",
    "the value of the ratio used for these sources was taken from fitting the combined model , and so are upper limits to the ratio .",
    "the  line does not show much relationship to the synchrotron ratio , while the h@xmath106  line does show a reduction in equivalent width with increasing amount of synchrotron .",
    "this lends some support to the hypothesis that excess synchrotron light is present .",
    "the difference in the two plots is likely due to the presence of the turnover in the synchrotron flux , so that is has less effect at the shorter wavelength of .",
    "there are , however , several sources that have high synchrotron ratios together with high equivalent widths .",
    "the implications of these results are discussed in section  [ sec - discuss ] .",
    "so far , we have shown that , for a number of sources , the optical  nir photometry is well fit with a power law plus a curved component , which we have assumed to be the turnover of a synchrotron component .",
    "however could another model be used instead of synchrotron ?",
    "one possible alternative is blackbody emission resulting from hot dust .    to test this model",
    ", we used a blackbody emission spectrum due to dust at a temperature of 1750 k ( the sublimation temperature characteristic of dust grains consisting of graphite and silicates , e.g.  laor & draine ) emitted in the quasars rest frame .",
    "a blackbody curve at this temperature would have its peak , in the quasar rest - frame , at @xmath107 .",
    "this blackbody spectrum was combined with the same @xmath108 power law used in the combined model to produce a model that was fit to the data .",
    "the fits generated by this model were almost always worse than those of the synchrotron model .",
    "this was due to the peak of the blackbody occurring at much longer observed wavelengths than the @xmath13 band . in only 12 cases was the @xmath83 value from the dust model less than that of the synchrotron model , and in most cases this was because the dust model had one more degree of freedom .",
    "for each of these objects , the sed took the form of a blue power law ( one object was @xmath109 , and the rest were bluer than @xmath110 ) that had a slight amount of reddening at the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands , which was fit by the presence of the dust blackbody curve . for the majority of the sources",
    ", however , the hot dust model was a lot worse than the synchrotron model , and so can not provide the peak in the optical / nir that is required to explain many of the observed seds .",
    "a number of authors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) have argued for the existence of a near - ir bump , somewhere around @xmath111 , corresponding to blackbody emission from hot dust .",
    "sanders et al . , also mention the presence of a local minimum at @xmath112 , which they note for its `` universality '' .",
    "they interpret this to be due to the finite sublimation temperature of dust , causing a drop in the blackbody emission , combined with the rise in flux of thermal emission from hot ( @xmath113k ) gas .",
    "any dip observed in our data occurs at wavelengths which are too short to be attributed to hot dust . to observe a @xmath112 dip",
    ", we would need photometry at longer wavelengths .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec - data ] , the presence of a strong emission line in the wavelength range of one of the filters will raise the sed level above that of the continuum , which will increase the systematic error in the photometry .    to test this effect , and to see how the fits to the photometry",
    "are affected , we examined several sources whose spectra showed significant emission lines . to calculate the contribution of the emission line , we define the total flux in the line as @xmath114 and the total continuum flux _ under _ the line as @xmath115",
    ". then the change in magnitude is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the equivalent width of the line , and @xmath118 is the wavelength range over which the flux is measured .",
    "the equivalent widths and fluxes were computed using the _ splot _ routine in iraf .",
    "note that we are only able to do this analysis for a small number of sources , as we do not have spectra for all sources , and those spectra that we do have are often poor quality , and in almost all cases non - simultaneous .",
    "the values of the change in magnitude , when considered over the same wavelength range as that of the broad - band filters ( @xmath119  for the optical bands ) , ranged from 0.05  0.25 magnitudes . by artificially reducing the flux in the relevant band by this amount",
    ", we could evaluate the change in @xmath25 caused by the presence of the emission line .",
    "this was done for several sources that had strong emission lines present in their spectra ( the spectra for a large number of phfs sources will be presented elsewhere ( francis et al . , in preparation ) ) .",
    "a few specific examples :    * 1510@xmath98089 has a strong h@xmath18  line in the @xmath10 band ( @xmath120 ) , as well as a combination of a strong h@xmath106  line and prominent  emission in the @xmath9 band ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the removal of flux corresponding to these lines caused a reduction in @xmath83 of nearly 50% ( 1.28  0.68 ) , without greatly changing the resultant fit , although the fitted synchrotron peak was at a slightly longer wavelength .",
    "* 1725@xmath15044 , similarly , has h@xmath18  in @xmath10 band ( @xmath122 ) and h@xmath106  +  in @xmath9 band ( @xmath123 ) , and removal of these more than halves @xmath83 from 2.49 to 1.17 , without changing the location of the peak of the synchrotron . *",
    "1036@xmath98154 has a large  line in the @xmath7 band ( @xmath124 ) , which causes a noticeable upturn in the sed .",
    "removal of this line reduces the @xmath83 from 0.77 to 0.56 , without changing the location of the peak wavelength , although the @xmath90 ratio increases slightly ( from 5.3 to 7.2 ) .",
    "* 1136@xmath98135 is initially fit with a pure power law , and this remains the case after removal of the  line ( @xmath125 in @xmath7 ) and both the h@xmath106  and the strong  ( total @xmath121 in @xmath10 ) .",
    "the power law index softens slightly ( from -1.85 to -1.81 ) and the @xmath83 value decreases from 0.43 to 0.29 .    in conclusion , by selecting quasars with strong emission lines",
    ", we have demonstrated that the largest changes to the sed are @xmath126 in one wave - band . in most cases",
    "investigated , removal of the line flux improved the @xmath83 value , but did not significantly alter the nature of the fit . when good quality long - wavelength spectra ( preferably at least quasi - simultaneous with the photometry , which is not the case here ) are available for these quasars , it should be possible to recalculate the fits , taking the emission line contributions into account , although we do not expect the general conclusions to change .",
    "the fitting of a single power law to the photometry , as detailed in section  [ sec - powerlaw ] , separates the sources into classes depending on the goodness of the power law fit and the value of the spectral index .",
    "the combined model fits have refined this description so that we are able to talk about the different types of sources present in the sample .",
    "firstly , the bluest sources are all fitted with the power law model , and are generally consistent with being the same type of sources as optically - selected quasars .",
    "the power law model also best fits a number of objects of intermediate slope ( @xmath127 ) , as well as a few red sources ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "these latter sources , as seen in section  [ sec - pol ] , are generally high polarisation sources , and so are likely to be synchrotron dominated ( they of course show no evidence for a turn - over similar to that being fit by the synchrotron model , although their slope could be due to a very steep energy distribution ( i.e.  large @xmath30 ) or a more gradual turn - over ) .",
    "the presence of the intermediate power law slopes raises interesting issues .",
    "do we see similar sources in optical quasar surveys ?",
    "in fig .  [ fig - indexcomp ] , we have plotted the power law index distributions for the sources best fit by the power law model , as well as the lbqs quasars from francis .",
    "while we can not say that the two data sets come from different parent distributions ( the kolmogorov - smirnov test probability for the null hypothesis that the parent distributions are the same is 11.3% ) , there does appear to be an excess of quasars in our sample for @xmath129 .",
    "this may indicate that the accretion disk emission in radio loud quasars has a broader range of colours , which would have implications for models of accretion disk emission .",
    "the power law sources , like all sources in the phfs , have a radio synchrotron component .",
    "the peak of this component may be at longer wavelengths than those covered by our observations , i.e.  in the ir .",
    "this would be consistent with observations of flat - spectrum radio quasars in the far - infrared @xcite .",
    "these longer wavelength peaks would be due to lower energy emitting particles , and would therefore constitute the extension of the energy distribution , of which we see the high energy end in the two - component sources . to test this assertion , one needs to obtain observations at longer wavelengths than the k band .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining observations of a number of sources at @xmath130 band , and the results will be published and discussed at a later date .",
    "secondly , the combined model generally best fits the redder sources , although some intermediate sources are also fit , particularly those with seds that show inflections .",
    "the synchrotron components fit to these sources photometry all peak in the rest - frame optical and nir .",
    "thirdly , the other category of sources are those that are optically faint .",
    "these sources all decrease in flux towards shorter wavelengths ( indeed , some are not detected in the @xmath7 band ) , and we suggest that these sources are heavily dust - reddened .",
    "we note that an exponentially reddened power law has the same form as the synchrotron component we are fitting , and these sources are fit by a combined model with a dominant synchrotron component .",
    "finally , we can check the consistency of our model fits by plotting the sources on a colour - colour diagram . in fig .",
    "[ fig - colour ] we plot the @xmath131 colours of all sources against the @xmath132 colours  that is , the infrared colour against the optical colour .",
    "we separate the sources into their fitted model types , separating the power law sources by their fitted slope ( using @xmath133 as the dividing line ) .",
    "clear distinctions can be made between the different model types .",
    "the blue power law sources lie at the bottom left corner , indicating blue colours in both optical and infrared , while as the power law becomes redder , the sources move towards the upper - right .",
    "many of the combined fits are in the optically - red region of the plot , indicating that the sed is turning over in the optical ( similar to 1256@xmath98229 in fig .  [ fig - ex ] , for example ) .",
    "the reddest sources in @xmath132 are sources with optical continua that drop towards the blue , in the manner of 1706@xmath15006 ( see fig .  [ fig - ex ] ) , which are typical of dusty sources , or sources dominated by host galaxy emission , and are fit by a dominant synchrotron component .",
    "note that 1706@xmath15006 is the faintest of the sources shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ex ] , and so is a good candidate for dust extinction .",
    "other combined sources , however , are among the bluer sources in the optical , but have redder nir colours than the power law sources .",
    "these are the sources that show an inflection , similar to 1546@xmath15067 in fig .",
    "[ fig - ex ] , where the synchrotron component is dominant in the nir but turns over and has less effect in the optical .      as explained in section  [ sec - data ] , there are a number of sources that were excluded from the sample . some of these were excluded for the sole reason that they did not have a measured redshift .",
    "these sources were generally quite red and optically faint ( thus explaining their undetermined redshift ) , with the exception of the bl lac object 0048@xmath98097 , which has a power law sed .",
    "we fitted our models to the observed wavelengths of these objects , to investigate the bias created by excluding them .",
    "note that this fitting does not take into account the change in shape of the synchrotron spectrum due to the redshift of the source .",
    "the results are summarised in table  [ tab - excluded ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     reducing the value of @xmath30 means that the synchrotron spectrum has a bluer slope , which enhances the effect of the turn - over . using a lower value of @xmath30 in the combined model results in some sources , otherwise fit by the power law , being instead fit by the combined model",
    "this is indeed seen in table  [ tab - param ] , where the number of sources fit by a power law decreases as you move from @xmath134 to @xmath71 to @xmath135 ( if the value of @xmath39 is kept constant ) , while the number of sources fit by the combined model increases .",
    "note also that more sources have good fits for the lower values of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath84 distributions are also affected by a changing @xmath30 value . for lower @xmath30 values , there are more sources with shorter @xmath84 values ( that is , close to @xmath136 ) .",
    "this is due to the slope of the power law tail of the synchrotron spectrum : for higher @xmath30 values the slope is redder , and so such a synchrotron spectrum peaking around @xmath136 would contribute too much at the longer wavelengths .    for the spectral index of the blue optical power law used in the combined model , we considered both steeper and flatter values than the one mentioned in section  [ sec - bbb ] .",
    "the dispersion found by francis for the slopes of lbqs quasars is @xmath137 , and so we consider here slopes in @xmath28 of @xmath138 and @xmath139 .    changing the slope of this power law ( while keeping @xmath30 constant )",
    "has a much less drastic effect than changing the value of @xmath30 .",
    "as the slope becomes steeper in @xmath28 ( that is , bluer ) , we see that only a couple of sources fit by the power law change to be fit by the combined model .",
    "the distribution of @xmath84 values is not changed considerably by the variation of the @xmath39 values .    in summary , reasonable changes to the fiducial values of @xmath39 and @xmath30 make little difference to the fits , both in the @xmath84 distribution and the numbers fitted by each model , although the difference will be accentuated if the values of @xmath39 and @xmath30 are both taken to extremes .",
    "thus far , we have been considering a synchrotron model that peaks at some @xmath84 and then turns over sharply ( i.e.  exponentially ) .",
    "the reasons we chose this were for consistency with other modelling done for optical synchrotron emission @xcite , and to provide the maximum contrast with the power law model .",
    "however , synchrotron emission could alternatively be present in the form of a power law .",
    "what if we have a model of the same form as the combined model , but with this power law synchrotron model instead ? is this any better at fitting the observations ?",
    "we constructed such a model , being a linear combination of the blue ( bbb ) power law from earlier , and a power law of variable index : @xmath140 . to distinguish it from the bbb power law , we restricted the indices to the range @xmath141 .",
    "this model was then fitted to the photometry in the same way as previously .",
    "note that the special case of @xmath142 is simply the power law fit from section  [ sec - powerlaw ] ( with the index restricted to lie in the above range ) .",
    "the @xmath83 values for this model are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig-2pl ] against those for the combined model detailed in section  [ sec - models ] .",
    "the symbols used indicate which model is preferred , and whether it is a good or bad fit . for sources that are bluer than @xmath108 , the best fit is always with no synchrotron component ( for both forms of the synchrotron model ) , as the presence of the second component will redden the blue power law . hence , for these sources , both the original combined model and the two power law model give the same fit , consisting of just the @xmath108 ( i.e.  bbb ) power law .",
    "these sources are indicated by the `` equal fit '' symbols on fig .",
    "[ fig-2pl ] .",
    "the power law synchrotron model obviously does not do as well at explaining the optical / nir seds of the quasars as the model with a turn - over .",
    "only 22 sources have a good power law synchrotron fit that is better than their fit from the synchrotron model with a turn - over , and only two of these ( 1034@xmath98293 and 2329@xmath98415 , with indices of @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively ) are significantly better .",
    "these power law synchrotron sources may have turn - overs at shorter wavelengths , beyond our currently available data .",
    "the only way to tell would be to obtain uv photometry ( ideally contemporaneous with the optical / nir ) .",
    "we note that many of the sources from fig .",
    "[ fig - ihist ] that are in the cross - hatched histogram ( that is , had better single power law fits than combined fits ) and had @xmath145 , also had fits with the two power law model that were better than those with the turnover synchrotron model .",
    "( this is not always the case , however , since going from one power law to two decreases the degrees of freedom , so the @xmath83 value will be greater . ) in most of these cases , the blue power law ( the @xmath108 component ) is either absent or has a very low normalisation .    for most sources ,",
    "however , the synchrotron model with a turn - over gives a much better fit to the observed optical / nir seds ( many of these sources show large ratios of synchrotron to blue power law flux ) .",
    "this result provides clear evidence that there is a break or a cutoff present in the energy distribution of the radiating particles .",
    "we can use the results of the emission line study in section  [ sec - emline ] to draw some conclusions about bl lac objects , which are noted for having very small or non - existent emission lines .",
    "this is usually explained by the presence of a beamed synchrotron component from a jet directed towards us ( * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig - ew ] seem to support this explanation , as the equivalent widths tend to decrease with increasing amount of fitted synchrotron , as you would expect if there was an extra synchrotron component over the top of the emission lines .    also , the fits to the bl lacs in our sample are suggestive of strong synchrotron components .",
    "all nine bl lacs are well fit by the combined model , and the @xmath90 ratios of the synchrotron to power law components range from 3 ( 0537@xmath98441 ) to over 700 ( 1256@xmath98229 ) ( see fig .  [ fig - ratio ] ) .",
    "these ratios , on average , are higher than the rest of the population ( although it is only a small group )",
    ".    however , there may be more to the story . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio ] , there are a number of sources with comparable ratios to the bl lacs .",
    "also , fig .",
    "[ fig - ew ] shows signs of a large dispersion in the equivalent width distribution , particularly at the high - ratio end , with sources present that have relatively high ratios at the emission lines in question , as well as large equivalent widths .",
    "perhaps there are other factors that determine whether an object is a bl lac or not .",
    "one factor that is likely to be important is the strength or dominance of the emission line region , with bl lacs having an intrinsically weak emission line flux .",
    "such an idea agrees with other studies : for example , ghisellini et al . , who found that bl lac objects had significantly lower doppler factors than core - dominated quasars .",
    "this was interpreted as suggesting that bl lac objects have intrinsically weaker emission lines than core - dominated quasars .",
    "the results of this paper can be summarised in the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "radio - loud quasars require one of at least two components to fit the rest frame optical seds .",
    "these two components are well modelled by an optical power law which in some sources is similar to the blue power law seen in optically - selected quasars , and a synchrotron component that turns over in the range @xmath146 .",
    "the model fits require the synchrotron component to have a break or turn - over at some wavelength @xmath84 in the observed wavelength range .",
    "a synchrotron spectrum with this break gives a much better fit to the data than a pure power law synchrotron model .",
    "the value of @xmath84 provides strong constraints on the modelling of particle acceleration and emission mechanisms .",
    "3 .   there is more than 4 orders of magnitude variation in the ratio of the synchrotron component to the power law component in those sources fit by the combined model .",
    "all the sources identified as bl lacs lie at the high end of the distribution .",
    "the fitting procedure is robust to reasonable changes in the values of the model parameters .",
    "the fits are statistically consistent with the data . 5",
    ".   there may be an excess of red power law sources compared to optically - selected quasars .",
    "this will have implications for emission models of accretion disks .",
    "sources which are well - fitted by power laws have a synchrotron component which may peak in the ir . in the optical ,",
    "these sources may be similar to optically - selected quasars .",
    "7 .   optical polarisation measurements ( taken from the literature ) support the synchrotron model fits to the seds .",
    "there is some evidence for the equivalent widths of emission lines being reduced by the presence of the synchrotron component .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that bl lac objects have a dominant synchrotron component , although other effects may contribute to the lack of emission lines in bl lacs .",
    "the red component fitted to the data , which has a turnover at some peak wavelength , can not be hot dust .",
    "emission from hot dust can not peak at @xmath147 as is required by our data .",

    "<S> we present model fits to spectral energy distributions in the optical and nir of @xmath0 flat - spectrum radio quasars from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath1 of the sources have power - law seds , while a similar number show evidence for two primary components : a blue power law and optical synchrotron emission . </S>",
    "<S> the blue power law is similar to the dominant component observed in the spectra of optically - selected qsos . </S>",
    "<S> there is strong evidence that the synchrotron component has a turnover in the uv - optical rest frame of the spectrum . in the remaining sources it is likely that the synchrotron peaks at longer wavelengths </S>",
    "<S> this mixture of two components is supported by optical polarisation measurements in a subgroup of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> the sources with power law seds show evidence for an excess number of red power law slopes compared to optically - selected quasars . </S>",
    "<S> there are additional spectral components in some of the sources , such as dust and the underlying galaxy , which have not been considered here .    </S>",
