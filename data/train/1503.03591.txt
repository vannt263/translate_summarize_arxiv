    "<S> it was observed that @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 undergoes a structural phase transition at @xmath4 k accompanied by fairly large hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> this structural phase transition is expected to be similar to that observed in closely related crcl@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetizations and magnetic susceptibilities are strongly anisotropic , which mainly arise from the anisotropic @xmath5-factors , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath8 plane , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath5-factors and the obtained entropy indicate that the effective spin of ru@xmath2 is one - half , which results from the low - spin state . </S>",
    "<S> specific heat data show that magnetic ordering occurs in four steps at zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the successive magnetic phase transitions should be ascribed to the competition among exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic phase diagram for @xmath9 is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the strongly anisotropic @xmath5-factors in @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 and deduce that the exchange interaction is strongly xy - like . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 is magnetically described as a three - dimensionally coupled xy - like frustrated magnet on a honeycomb lattice . </S>"
