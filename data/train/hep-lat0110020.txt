    "we have studied what happens , when scalar fields are included @xcite .",
    "we have found that an additional `` layered '' phase appears .",
    "it consists of a stack of 3-branes , one lattice spacing apart , that are in the higgs phase and the fields are confined on each layer .",
    "the phase diagram comprises thus of five phases , three bulk and two layered : a confining phase ( @xmath0 ) , a bulk higgs phase ( @xmath1 ) a bulk coulomb phase ( @xmath2 ) , a layered coulomb phase ( @xmath3 ) and a layered higgs phase ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we obtained the phase diagram by monte carlo simulations and mean field theory calculations . indeed the phase of `` layers '' is found also as a solution of the mean field ( i.e. classical ) equations of motion .",

    "the fields in these configurations are _ confined _ on these layers .",
    "this confinement is not put in by hand  it is the defining characteristic of the layered phase(s ) .",
    "the transitions between these layered phases and the usual bulk phases are , generically , 1st order ; however it is also possible to find subsets in the space of parameter values , that lead to second order transitions .",
    "this points to the possibility of new , strongly coupled , continuum theories@xcite , whose elucidation is of major interest .",
    "it is to be noted that yang - mills theories should exhibit @xmath26-brane configurations with @xmath27 , since they have a coulomb phase in more than four dimensions .",
    "another alternative , relevant for four dimensions , would be the partial breaking of the yang - mills gauge group , that leaves a @xmath14 factor in the residual gauge group .",
