    "the usage of alternative sources of power has caused that the problem of energy transfer optimization has become increasingly involved with nonsinusoidal signals and nonlinear loads . the power factor ( pf )",
    "is used to measure the effectiveness of the transfer of energy between an electrical source and a load .",
    "it is defined as the ratio between the power consumed by a load ( real or active power ) , denoted as @xmath0 , and the power delivered by a source ( apparent power ) , denoted as @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 the active power is defined as the average of the instantaneous power and apparent power as the product of the rms values of the load current and source voltage . the standard approach to improve",
    "the power factor is to place a lossless compensator , such as a capacitor or an inductor , parallel to the load .",
    "conceptually , the design of the compensator typically assumes that the source is ideal , i.e. , the internal ( thevenin ) impedance is negligible , producing a fixed sinusoidal voltage .",
    "if the load is linear and time - invariant ( lti ) and the source voltage is sinusoidal , the resulting stationary current is a shifted sinusoid , and the power factor equals the cosine of the phase - shift angle between the source voltage and current .",
    "classically , the remaining part of the power is called reactive power , and is denoted as @xmath3 . the relationship between the three types of power",
    "is given by @xmath4 any improvement of the pf is accomplished by the reduction of the absolute value of the reactive power , hence reducing the phase - shift between the current and the voltage .      for periodic nonsinusoidal voltages and currents ,",
    "the problem of decomposing the apparent power into active and reactive components is much more involved .",
    "the active power in the nonsinusoidal case is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 denoting the rms value of the @xmath8-th harmonic component of the voltage and the current , respectively , and @xmath9 denoting the angle between the @xmath8-th harmonic component of the voltage and the current .",
    "inspired by the form of the active power , budeanu @xcite defined reactive power as @xmath10 and also observed that for nonsinusoidal voltages and currents the quadratic sum of the active and reactive power is not equal to the apparent power .",
    "given this difference , a concept called distortion power @xmath11 was introducted .    ) and compensated ( @xmath12).,scaledwidth=30.0% ]      consider the rl circuit depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlcircuit ] for @xmath13 . given a sinusoidal source voltage of the form @xmath14 , the associated current is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the magnitude of the load admittance @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 the associated phase shift . in this case , the active power is computed as @xmath19 w and the reactive power equals @xmath20 var . hence , the apparent power equals @xmath21 va and the power factor equals @xmath22 . if a shunt capacitor is placed as a compensator , then it is clear that a capacitor of @xmath23 f is necessary to compensate the effect of the inductance and drive the power factor to unity .",
    "if the source is replaced by a nonsinusoidal voltage @xmath24 , the associated current becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . using ( [ eq : budeanup ] ) and ( [ eq : budeanuq ] ) and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the root - mean - square ( rms ) value ( see ( [ eq : rms ] ) ) , the various power quantities and the power factor for the uncompensated circuit according to budeanu s power model",
    "are presented in table [ tab : example1 ] .    as shown in the third column , although the addition of a shunt capacitor completely compensates the reactive power , the power factor is worse than in the uncompensated case .",
    "hence the compensation of budeanu s reactive power alone may be useless for power factor improvement as the influence of the distortion power , that only appears in nonsinusoidal periodic signals , makes this compensation far from optimal .",
    "hence , it can be concluded that budeanu s concept of reactive and distortion power does not exhibit any useful attributes that could be related to the physical power phenomena in the load network .",
    "consequently , these quantities do not provide any useful information for the design of optimal compensating circuits . although this deficiency is widely documented in the literature ,",
    "see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and acknowledged by the latest ieee standard on power definitions @xcite , budeanu s power model had a widespread influence for decades .",

    "this paper presents a novel perspective of the cpc decomposition @xcite in the time - domain , and proposes to decompose the reactive current into two additional components : an average reactive current and a scattered reactive current .",
    "furthermore , for the sake of symmetry , the original cpc scattered current is proposed to be referred to as active scattered current .",
    "the time - domain cpc decomposition naturally follows from the notion of a conductance and susceptance operator . of key importance is the concept of iliovici s reactive power integral , which is a measure of the area of the loop formed by the lissajous plot of the current against the voltage . for sinusoidal systems , this loop area",
    "is directly associated to the amount of phase - shift produced by the load @xcite . for sinusoidal systems , iliovici s integral",
    "is equivalent with the reactive power .",
    "however , for nonsinusoidal systems iliovici s integral represents the average of the reactive powers associated to each harmonic present in the source voltage .",
    "in contrast to our previous work @xcite , which considers a time - domain cpc decomposition that is based on an even  odd decomposition of the load s impulse response , the results presented herein show that the origin of @xmath30 ( active + scattered active current ) and @xmath31 ( iliovici + scattered reactive current ) can be related to distinctive powers distributed in the load that can be observed from measurements :    * the current @xmath30 represents the equivalent portion of the currents that are proportional to the ratio of the powers that are circulating among the resistive branches of the load and the associated rms values of the voltage .",
    "these quantities can be measured as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_measure ] ( left ) .",
    "note that the measured @xmath32 provides the value of the integrals appearing in ( [ eq : ig - time ] ) , i.e. , @xmath33 * the current @xmath31 represents the equivalent portion of the currents that are proportional to the powers that are circulating among the inductive and capacitive branches of the load and the associated rms values of the time - derivative of the voltage .",
    "these quantities can be measured as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_measure ] ( right ) .",
    "note that the measured @xmath34 provides the value of the iliovici reactive power integrals appearing in ( [ eq : ir - time ] ) , i.e. , @xmath35    based on the earlier work of the first author in @xcite , it can be shown that the power integrals appearing in the numerators of ( [ eq : bn - time ] ) and ( [ eq : gn - time ] ) can be obtained by summing the powers over the individual elements ( resistors , inductors , and capacitors ) in the load .",
    "thus , these powers satisfy tellegen s theorem .",
    "this naturally leads to the suggestion that the cpc decomposition may be converted into a conservative power theory , which is not surprising as the exposition of sections [ sec : timedomainpower][sec : overall ] appears to be closely related to the conservative power theory ( cpt ) developed by tenti et al .",
    "@xcite .      for nonsinusoidal systems",
    ", this means that compensation using a single lossless shunt element , like a ( bank of ) capacitor(s ) , or an inductor , only compensates the average reactive power .",
