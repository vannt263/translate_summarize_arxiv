    "in the aim of achieving a robust processing of quantum information , one of the main tasks is to prepare and to protect various quantum states . through the last 15 years",
    ", the application of quantum feedback paradigms has been investigated by many physicists  @xcite as a possible solution for this robust preparation . however , most ( if not all ) of these efforts have remained at a theoretical level and have not been able to be give rise to successful experiments .",
    "this is essentially due to the necessity of simulating , in parallel to the system , a quantum filter  @xcite providing an estimate of the state of the system based on the historic of quantum jumps induced by the measurement process .",
    "indeed , it is , in general , difficult to perform such simulations in real time . in this paper",
    ", we consider a prototype of physical systems , the photon - box , where we actually have the time to perform these computations in real time ( see  @xcite for a detailed description of this cavity quantum electrodynamics system ) .",
    "taking into account the measurement - induced quantum projection postulate , the most practical measurement protocols in the aim of feedback control are the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements  @xcite .",
    "these are the measurements which preserve the value of the measured observable . indeed , by considering a well - designed qnd measurement process where the quantum state to be prepared is an eigenstate of the measurement operator , the measurement process , not only , is not an obstacle for the state preparation but can even help by adding some controllability .    in  @xcite qnd measures are exploited to detect and/or produce highly non - classical states of light trapped in a super - conducting cavity ( see  @xcite for a description of such qed systems and  @xcite for detailed physical models with qnd measures of light using atoms ) . for such experimental setups ,",
    "we detail and analyze here a feedback scheme that stabilizes the cavity field towards any photon - number states ( fock states ) .",
    "such states are strongly non - classical since their photon numbers are perfectly defined .",
    "the control corresponds to a coherent light - pulse injected inside the cavity between atom passages .",
    "the overall structure of the proposed feedback scheme is inspired by  @xcite using a quantum adaptation of the observer / controller structure widely used for classical systems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . as the measurement - induced quantum jumps and the controlled field injection happen in a discrete - in - time manner , the observer part of the proposed feedback scheme consists in a discrete - time quantum filter .",
    "indeed , the discreteness of the measurement process provides us a first prototype of quantum systems where we , actually , have enough time to perform the quantum filtering and to compute the measurement - based feedback law to be applied as the controller .    from a mathematical modeling point of view",
    ", the quantum filter evolves through a discrete - time markov chain .",
    "the estimated state is used in a state - feedback , based on a lyapunov design . indeed , by considering a natural candidate for the lyapunov function , we propose a feedback law which ensures the decrease of its expectation over the markov process .",
    "therefore , the value of the considered lyapunov function over the markov chain defines a super - martingale .",
    "the convergence analysis of the closed - loop system is , therefore , based on some rather classical tools from stochastic stability analysis  @xcite .",
    "one of the particular features of the system considered in this paper corresponds to a non - negligible delay in the feedback process .",
    "in fact , in the experimental setup considered through this paper , we have to take into account a delay of @xmath0 steps between the measurement process and the feedback injection .",
    "indeed , there are , constantly , @xmath0 atoms flying between the photon box ( the cavity ) to be controlled and the atom - detector ( typically @xmath1 ) . therefore , in our feedback design",
    ", we do not have access to the measurement results for the @xmath0 last atoms . through this paper , we propose an adaptation of the quantum filter , based on a stochastic version of the smith predictor  @xcite , which takes into account this delay by predicting the actual state of the system without having access to the result of @xmath0 last detections .    in the next section , we describe briefly the physical system and the associated quantum monte - carlo model . in section  [ sec",
    ": open - loop ] , we consider the dynamics of the open - loop system .",
    "we will prove , through theorem  [ thm : openloop ] that the qnd measurement process , without any additional controlled injection , allows a non - deterministic preparation of the fock states .",
    "indeed , we will see that the associated markov chain converges , necessarily , towards a fock state and that the probability of converging towards a fixed fock state is given by its population over the initial state .",
    "also , through proposition  [ prop : openlooplin ] , we will show that the linearized open - loop system around a fixed fock state admits strictly negative lyapunov exponents ( see appendix  [ append : lyap - exp ] for a definition of the lyapunov exponent ) .    in section  [ sec : closed - loop ]",
    ", we propose a lyapunov - based feedback design allowing to stabilize globally the delayed closed - loop system around a desired fock state .",
    "the theorem  [ thm : closedloop ] proves the almost sure convergence of the trajectories of the closed - loop system towards the target fock state .",
    "also , through proposition  [ prop : closedlooplin ] , we will prove that the linearized closed - loop system around the target fock state admits strictly negative lyapunov exponents .    finally in section",
    "[ sec : filter ] , we propose a brief discussion on the considered quantum filter and by proving a rather general separation principle ( theorem  [ thm : separation ] ) , we will show a semi - global robustness with respect to the knowledge of the initial state of the system . also ,",
    "through a brief analysis of the linearized system - observer around the target fock state and applying the propositions  [ prop : openlooplin ] and  [ prop : closedlooplin ] , we show that its largest lyapunov exponent is also strictly negative ( proposition  [ prop : filterlin ] ) .",
