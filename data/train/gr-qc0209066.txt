    "binary black holes are among the most promising sources for the gravitational wave laser interferometers currently under development , including ligo , virgo , geo , tama and lisa .",
    "the identification and interpretation of possible signals requires theoretically predicted gravitational wave templates . for the late epoch of the binary inspiral ,",
    "numerical relativity is the most promising tool for the computation of such templates .",
    "the numerical simulation even of single black holes has encountered numerous difficulties , which presumably arise from the complexity of einstein s equations , the existence of a singularity inside the black hole , and the gauge ( or coordinate ) freedom inherent in general relativity .",
    "some recent developments , however , have led to significant and very promising advances .",
    "traditionally , most numerical relativity simulations were based on the @xmath2 decomposition of arnowitt , deser and misner ( adm , @xcite ) , which has been shown to develop instabilities often @xcite . to avoid these instabilities ,",
    "a number of hyperbolic formulations of einstein s equations have been developed ( see , e.g. , @xcite as well as @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively , shibata and nakamura @xcite and baumgarte and shapiro @xcite introduced a modification of the original adm equations that involves a conformal - traceless decomposition and the introduction of a new auxiliary variable ( see section [ bf ] below ) .",
    "this formulation , now commonly referred to as the bssn formulation , has led to significant improvements over the original adm equations , and has been widely adopted ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "singularities inside black holes were traditionally avoided by using `` singularity avoiding '' coordinate conditions , including maximal or polar slicing @xcite . typically , these conditions lead to grid pathologies that cause codes to crash after relatively short times .",
    "an alternative strategy takes advantage of the fact that the black hole exterior is causally disconnected from the interior , so that a region of the black hole interior including the singularity can be excised from the computational grid .",
    "these `` singularity excision '' techniques @xcite have led to large improvements in the simulation of single black holes , and are a promising tool for binary black hole evolutions ( see @xcite for preliminary results ) .",
    "the application of singularity excision requires a coordinate system that is regular across black hole horizons , allowing smooth horizon penetration . for single black holes ,",
    "one such coordinate system is the kerr - schild form , which can be used to represent both schwarzschild and kerr black holes ( and which is also invariant under boosts ) .",
    "binary black hole initial data based on kerr - schild coordinates can be constructed by solving the constraint equations of general relativity for `` corrections '' arising from superpositions of two boosted kerr - schild black holes @xcite .",
    "alcubierre and brgmann @xcite recently combined the bssn formalism with a particularly simple singularity excision method to evolve single black holes in kerr - schild coordinates . restricting the evolution to octant symmetry ,",
    "all fields settle down to equilibrium ( of the finite - difference equations ) , and no instabilities are encountered . if , however , the symmetry assumption is relaxed , instabilities develop and the code crashes after a few hundred @xmath3 .",
    "similar findings were reported in @xcite , where a completely independent formulation and implementation was adopted .",
    "improvements over these results were discussed in @xcite , but even these do not completely eliminate the instabilities for evolutions without symmetry assumptions .",
    "recent results suggest that adding constraints to the evolution equations affects the numerical stability of the system ( e.g.  @xcite ; see @xcite for an illustration in electrodynamics ) . in this paper",
    "we experiment with adding the new constraints that appear in the bssn formulation to the evolution equation of the new auxiliary functions , and , following @xcite , the hamiltonian constraint to the evolution equation for the spatial metric .",
    "we also experiment with schemes for imposing algebraic constraints on the conformally related metric and extrinsic curvature , as well as with different shapes for the excised region inside the black hole .    with these modifications",
    "we obtain evolutions of single black holes that last over several thousand @xmath3 , independent of any symmetry assumptions , without encountering any evidence of a growing instability .",
    "these findings hold both for static black holes and for rotating black holes with specific angular momentum of up to @xmath4 .",

    "we present results of our simulations for both static and rotating bhs .",
    "we summarize and discuss the implications of our findings in sec .",
    "we also include an appendix that explains our evaluation of the adm mass and angular momentum . throughout the paper we adopt geometrized units with @xmath5 .",
    "we write the metric in the adm form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lapse function , @xmath8 is the shift vector , and @xmath9 is the spatial metric . throughout this paper ,",
    "latin indices are spatial indices and run from 1 to 3 , whereas greek indices are space - time indices and run from 0 to 3 .",
    "the einstein equations can then be decomposed into the hamiltonian constraint @xmath10 and the momentum constraints @xmath11 @xmath12 and the evolution equations @xmath13 here we have assumed vacuum @xmath14 and have used @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lie derivative with respect to @xmath8 .",

    "the constraints are monitored only as a code check .",
    "it may be advantageous , however , either to enforce at least some of the constraints during the evolution , or to add evolution constraint equations to the evolution equations .",
    "alcubierre and brgmann @xcite , for example , found improved stability properties when the algebraic constraint ( [ tra ] ) is enforced .",
    "this can be achieved by replacing @xmath70 with @xmath71 after each time step .",
    "they also found improvements , at least in octant symmetry , when using the conformal connection function @xmath72 only in places where it is differentiated , and instead use , by virtue of ( [ gi ] ) , the contraction of the christoffel symbols everywhere else @xmath73    other ways of imposing some of the constraints are possible ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "while the rule ab1 ( equation [ ab1 ] ) is appealing in that it treats all components of @xmath66 identically , we found particularly stable results by dynamically evolving only five of the six components of @xmath66 , and computing the @xmath74 component using the algebraic constraint ( [ tra ] ) @xmath75 we similarly determine @xmath76 from the other five metric components using the algebraic constraint ( [ deg ] ) @xmath77 in all our simulations , we use these two identities instead of rule ab1 .",
    "combining ( [ azz ] ) and ( [ gzz ] ) with rule ab2 leads to exponentially growing , unstable modes if no symmetry assumption is used . while it is not clear what exactly causes this instability in the absence of symmetry assumptions , one possible source is the last term in the evolution equation ( [ eq : evolgamma2 ] ) for @xmath38 , @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath79 , as for example for single black holes in kerr - schild coordinates , then this term may lead to exponential growth of any numerical error in @xmath38 ( compare a similar discussion in @xcite ) .",

    "we experiment with both cubic and spherical excision regions . for cubical excision regions ,",
    "we adopt the recipe suggested by @xcite to copy the time derivative of every field at the boundary from its value on a neighboring grid - point . for surfaces , we copy from the nearest grid - point along the outward normal , and for edges and corners from the nearest grid - point along the corresponding diagonal .    a generalization of this copying algorithm for spherical excision methods has been suggested in @xcite . for a boundary grid - point @xmath96 of the excised sphere",
