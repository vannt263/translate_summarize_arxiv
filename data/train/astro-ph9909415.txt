    "recently , we have published our discoveries of a previously unknown galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) ( aschenbach 1998 , iyudin et al .",
    "the x - ray image obtained in the rosat all - sky survey shows a disk - like , partially limb brightened emission region of 2@xmath7 in diameter , which is the typical appearance of a shell - like snr ( cf .",
    "[ picture ] ) .",
    "the pspc x - ray spectra reveal rather high temperatures of @xmath8 3@xmath510@xmath9 k , which indicate that rx j0852.0 - 4622 is a young object . combining the low age and the 2@xmath7 angular extent it",
    "is concluded that rx j0852.0 - 4622 is relatively close - by .",
    "comparison with historical snrs limits the age to about @xmath0 1500 yrs and the distance to @xmath101 kpc .",
    "the case of rx j0852.0 - 4622 being an snr was clinched by the detection of @xmath1-ray line emission from @xmath2ti , which is a titanium isotope exclusively produced in supernovae .",
    "the centre of the @xmath2ti source , called gro j0852 - 4642 , is off - set from the center of rx j0852.0 - 4622 by 0.4@xmath7 , but this is significantly less than the angular resolution of the comptel instrument , so that rx j0852.0 - 4622 and gro j0852 - 4642 are considered to be the same object . using a weighted mean lifetime of @xmath2ti of 90.4 yrs , the angular diameter and adopting a mean expansion velocity of 5000 km / s as well as a @xmath2ti yield of 5@xmath510@xmath11 m@xmath12 age and distance are uniquely determined to @xmath0680 yrs and @xmath0200 pc , respectively . therefore",
    ", rx j0852.0 - 4622/gro j0852 - 4642 could be the nearest supernova to earth to have occured during recent human history .",
    "the discovery of rx j0852.0 - 4622 and the interpretation as an snr was made by one of us ( ba ) in early 1996 . during the time which followed it",
    "was attempted to associate some fraction of the @xmath3al @xmath1-ray line emission from the vela snr region measured by comptel ( oberlack et al .",
    "1994 , diehl et al .",
    "1995 ) with rx j0852.0 - 4622 .",
    "the results have not been conclusive basically because of the unknown distance of rx j0852.0 - 4622 ( oberlack 1997 ) .",
    "the discovery of @xmath2ti @xmath1-ray line emission , however , made it clear that rx j0852.0 - 4622 is indeed a nearby object , so that we could take up again the discussion of the association of @xmath3al emission with rx j0852.0 - 4622 .",
    "for example the combination of just the @xmath3al and @xmath2ti data allow to derive a distance independent estimate of the age of gro j0852 - 4642 .",
    "furthermore , if a major fraction of the vela @xmath3al mass would be associated with the snr , a type ia supernova is excluded within the framework of current explosion models . under the assumption of adiabatic expansion ( sedov - like ) of the snr we give an estimate of the supernova explosion energy e@xmath13 related to the progenitor star and the ambient matter density n@xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainties in the determination of age and distance by exploiting the x - ray spectra are discussed to come up with a time span in which to search for the historical supernova event .    in a recent paper chen &  gehrels ( 1999 )",
    "conclude that rx j0852.0 - 4622 was created by a core - collapse supernova of a massive star .",
    "their analysis is based on the x - ray data and @xmath1-ray data published published earlier by us ( aschenbach 1998 , iyudin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we discuss their approach and conclusions in the relevant section .",
    "basis for the determination of the age and distance of the new snr is the law of radioactive chain - decay @xmath2ti  @xmath14sc  @xmath14ca , for which we have @xmath15 with the definitions : _ f _ photon flux density , _ d _ distance , _",

    "1 can be constrained by introducing the x - results .",
    "the angular radius @xmath26 = 1@xmath7 is related to @xmath24 and @xmath25 by @xmath26 = @xmath27  /  _ d _ , with @xmath28 the mean expansion velocity of the snr . by substituting @xmath24 or @xmath25 of eq .",
    "1 by @xmath28 a quantitative relation between @xmath29 and @xmath25 or @xmath29 and @xmath24 can be derived with @xmath28 as a parameter .",
    "an estimate of @xmath28 can be obtained from the x - ray spectra .",
    "the analysis of the rosat x - ray spectra is affected by the presence of the low energy emission of the vela snr , which is aggravated by the large size of rx j0852.0 - 4622 .",
    "but an archival rosat pspc pointing observation centred on the southeastern limb of the vela snr with an exposure of 11000 s happens to contain the northern limb section of rx j0852.0 - 4622 .",
    "the number of counts is sufficient to extract a small section of the limb as well as a small section of the vela snr offset by just 10 arcmin to create both uniform source and background spectra .",
    "limiting the analysis to these small regions , each 10 arcmin @xmath5 10 arcmin in size , reduces the impact of any spectral and spatial non - uniformity across the source and the background",
    ". fits to the residual northern limb spectrum were performed with a two component , optically thin thermal emission equilibrium model ( raymond - smith model ) with kt@xmath30 = 0.21@xmath31 kev , kt@xmath32 = 4.7@xmath33 kev and an absorption column density of n@xmath34 = @xmath352.3@xmath3610@xmath37 @xmath22 .",

    "the spectrum of the rest of the snr can be obtained only from the rosat all - sky survey data and because of the relatively low exposure the spatial region selected for analysis needs to be large which increases the uncertainty in assessing the background level from the vela snr . for the full remnant excluding the bright northern limb an acceptable fit with @xmath38 1",
    "is obtained with a two temperature model with kt@xmath44 = 0.14@xmath45 kev , kt@xmath46 = 2.5@xmath33 kev and n@xmath47 = @xmath354.0@xmath4810@xmath37 @xmath22 .",
    "the matter density of the shock - wave heated snr plasma can be derived from the observed x - ray flux @xmath49 via the relation @xmath49 = @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is the cooling function for the best - fit values of @xmath52 ; @xmath53 is the electron number density and @xmath54 is the number density of the un - shocked matter , intitially uniformly distributed in a sphere .",
    "furthermore , a factor of four has been used for the density jump at the shock .",
    "the low and high temperature components are associated with densities of @xmath55 = 0.6@xmath5d@xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 = 0.06@xmath5d@xmath56 @xmath57 , respectively , with d@xmath59 measured in units of 200 pc . despite the acceptable spectral",
    "fit the value of @xmath55 and the column density are quite uncertain , as the low temperature component could be significantly affected by the vela snr radiation , which is , however , not the case for @xmath58 .    as usual for thermal snrs",
    "two components with different temperatures are needed for equilibrium models to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "if the plasma is far from ionization equilibrium the low temperature component appears as an artifact because of the under - ionization .",
    "the time - scale to reach ionization equilibrium is about 10@xmath60  s  @xmath57/n@xmath61 , with n@xmath61 the electron density of the radiating plasma in units of @xmath57 . with @xmath25 = 680 yrs and the densities given above 1.5@xmath510@xmath62  s  @xmath63 n@xmath6410@xmath65  s  @xmath57 , which demonstrates that rx j0852.0 - 4622 departs significantly from ionization equilibrium .",
    "clearly the high temperatures observed are closer to the real electron temperature .",
    "but even the high temperatures may underestimate the average temperature of the electrons and ions if the electrons are heated mainly by coulomb collisons with the ions , which occurs on a timescale similar to that of reaching ionization equlibrium .",
    "the x - ray temperatures which have been produced by shock wave heating can be used to estimate the velocity @xmath66 of the shock wave : @xmath67@xmath68 ; @xmath69 is the proton mass and @xmath70 is the mean molecular weight , which is 0.6 for a fully ionized plasma of cosmic abundances . again , this relation is for a density jump of a factor of four at the shock . discarding the low temperature components as argued above the x - ray temperatures stretch from 1.8 kev @xmath71 kt@xmath59 @xmath71 9.2 kev including @xmath41-@xmath72 errors .",
    "the mean kt@xmath59 , which is consistent at the same significance level with both the radiation from the bulk of the snr and its northern limb section , taking the thermal option , is kt@xmath59 = 4.4 kev .",
    "the corresponding best estimates of the minimal and maximal shock velocities using the relation above are 1940 km / s , 1240 km / s and 2800 km / s , respectively .",
    "the current shock velocity @xmath66 is related to the mean expansion velocity @xmath28 by the past temporal evolution of the snr . with the limited observations available",
    "we are forced to rely on what is known about historical remnants .",
    "the compilation of strom ( 1994 ) provides both maximal internal shock velocity and mean expansion velocity and the ratio @xmath73 is 1.5 for the crab nebula and cas a , 2.5 for sn 1006 and 3.5 for the kepler and tycho snrs . for a purely adiabatic expansion in a uniform medium of constant matter density ( the sedov description ) @xmath73 = 2.5 .",
    "as strom has pointed out the observed maximal internal velocities may not be strictly related to @xmath66 but they provide a reasonable estimate .",
    "more recently measurements of the expansion rate in the x - ray band have become available by comparing images obtained with the einstein and rosat observatories or even just the rosat images taken at different epochs . both koralesky et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and vink et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found an expansion rate of cas a of 0.002% yr@xmath23 which corresponds to a factor of @xmath0 1.55 for the ratio of mean expansion rate over current expansion rate .",
    "hughes ( 1996 ) has found a similar value for the tycho snr . in each of these cases , however , the current expansion velocities , using reasonable distance estimates , are significantly larger than the x - ray spectra and temperatures indicate .",
    "therefore a factor of 1.5 for @xmath73 is a very conservative lower limit to estimate @xmath28 from x - ray spectra .    for a worst case estimate",
    "we define a velocity range for rx j0852.0 - 4622 applying factors of 1.5 , 2.5 , 3.5 to the minimal , best - estimate and maximal @xmath66 , respectively , which leads to a best - estimate expansion velocity @xmath74 = 5000 km / s bracketed by a minimal expansion velocity of @xmath75 = 2000 km / s and a maximal expansion velocity @xmath76 = 10000 km / s ; the values have been rounded off slightly .",
    "since we do nt know whether the x - ray temperatures are associated with either the blast wave heated ambient medium or the progenitor ejecta heated by reverse shocks , the expansion velocities derived may even be lower limits .",
    "similarly , the values are too low if the electrons have not reached thermal equilibrium with the ions . for the discussion of the impact of the expansion velocity on age and distance we note that the @xmath2ti line appears to be broadened ( iyudin et al .",
    "1998 ) , the origin of which is unknown . in the most extreme case that the width is exclusively attributed to doppler broadening",
    "the associated velocity is ( 15300@xmath43700 ) km / s with an upper limit of @xmath77 = 19000 km / s .",
    "we include @xmath77 for the sake of completeness , but we stress that the use of @xmath77 for constraining the type of progenitor is overinterpretating the @xmath1-ray data and it is essentially misleading .",
    "nevertheless , we add that nagataki ( 1999 ) quotes @xmath78 expansion velocities @xmath7912000 km / s for sub - chandrasekhar mass models of sne ia .",
    "[ age ] shows the relation between @xmath29 and the age @xmath25 of rx j0852.0 - 4622 parametrized by @xmath28 .",
    "despite the large uncertainty of @xmath28 , @xmath25 is determined to within @xmath4 100 yrs for fixed @xmath29 using @xmath28 of the x - ray data . for @xmath29 = 5@xmath510@xmath11 m@xmath12 and @xmath28 = @xmath80 , @xmath25 = 680 yrs and @xmath24 = 200 pc ( c.f .",
    "[ distance ] ) .",
    "age and distance are rather insensitive to the exact value of the @xmath2ti @xmath1-ray line flux . a total error of the flux of @xmath440% , which is the sum of the statistical error and the systematic error , broadens the range of @xmath25 by @xmath440 yrs and that of @xmath24 by @xmath4 10 pc .",
    "if rx j0852.0 - 4622 is expanding as fast as @xmath77 indicates the age would be as low as @xmath0500 yrs .",
    "model calculations provide a range for @xmath29 , which runs for symmetric core - collapse supernovae from 1.4@xmath510@xmath11 m@xmath12 to 2.3@xmath510@xmath81 m@xmath12 , depending on progenitor mass ( woosley & weaver 1995 , thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ) . within this range ( @xmath82 ) is within ( 500 yrs , 400 pc ) and ( 950 yrs , 80 pc ) .",
    "nagataki et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have pointed out that @xmath29 could be much higher in an axisymmetric collapse - driven supernova .",
    "for example , in their model with the highest degree of asymmetry they obtain @xmath29 = 5.1@xmath510@xmath81 for @xmath83 = 0.07 m@xmath12 .",
    "this value of @xmath29 would allow an age of up to 1000 yrs . for type ia supernovae",
    "we find 7.9@xmath510@xmath84 m@xmath12 @xmath85 @xmath71 4.7@xmath510@xmath11 m@xmath12 for carbon deflagration models ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 , iwamoto et al . 1999 ) , which do not significantly differ from the core - collapse sne , and accordingly the range for ( @xmath82 ) is not affected .",
    "values of @xmath29 as high as 2@xmath510@xmath86 m@xmath12 are obtained in he - detonation models ( woosley & weaver 1994 ) .",
    "this would allow ( @xmath82 ) to lie between ( 850 yrs , 500 pc ) and ( 1100 yrs , 100 pc ) .",
    "in summary , for any @xmath29 given by current models the upper limit of the distance of rx j0852.0 - 4622 is 500 pc and 1100 years for the age .",
    "chen &  gehrels ( 1999 ) have also used the x - ray temperature to derive age and distance , although in a slightly different manner .",
    "they use the temperature derived from the rosat data for the central region ( aschenbach 1998 ) which might not be representative for the current expansion velocity at the rim , why we prefer a somewhat higher velocity consistent with the apparently higher temperature observed at the limb . for the mean expansion velocity , which should be higher than the current expansion velocity by some factor ,",
    "chen &  gehrels derive a range of 2000  5000 km / s , whereas we propose a range of 2000 km / s to 10000 km / s by comparison with observational data obtained for the historical remnants . for given velocity and @xmath29",
    "our results agree with those obtained by chen &  gehrels , but our estimates allow a wider range of age and distance .",
    "@xmath2ti decays by electron capture , which means that lifetime depends on ionization stage , in particular to what extent the k shell is populated .",
    "the @xmath2ti lifetime of @xmath87 90 yrs is the mean lifetime for two electrons in the k - shell irrespective of the number of electrons in the higher shells . for just one electron in the k - shell , the hydrogen - like state @xmath2ti@xmath88",

    "lower mass progenitors like those leading to a sn of type ia are supposed to have significantly higher ejecta velocities and according to chen &  gehrels an ambient matter density @xmath79 500 @xmath57 is required to decelerate the explosion wave from initially 11000 km / s to the current value of 1300 km / s , using the relation v@xmath141 t@xmath142 ( chen &  gehrels , 1999 ) .",

    "if the @xmath190al line flux is about what is indicated by the comptel data the existing type ia supernova models can be ruled out for the progenitor explosion because they predict a ratio of the @xmath190al and @xmath187ti yield which is by far too large .",
    "they could be reconsidered only if less than 1% of the @xmath190al line flux from vela in total is associated with rx j0852.0 - 4622 .",
    "explosion models of core - collapse supernovae ( woosley & weaver , 1995 ) are in general in agreement with the observations , i.e. the measurements of @xmath28 , @xmath187ti line flux and @xmath190al line flux , judging from their prediction of the yields of @xmath187ti and @xmath190al . their models with @xmath191 10@xmath162 m@xmath12 and @xmath192",
    "10@xmath81 m@xmath12 can definitely be excluded because the yield of @xmath190al predicted is inconsistent with even the upper limit of the @xmath190al line flux measured for the vela region in total . in summary , both the energy balance and the yield predictions of the currently available explosion models point towards a core - collapse event .    within the vicinity of the explosion center",
    "two point - like x - ray emission regions have been found , either of which could be the manifestation of a neutron star .",
    "spectra are not available , but if the radiation is assumed to be black - body emisson , the x - ray flux indicates a surface temperature of @xmath873@xmath510@xmath6 k , which is surprisingly low for a 700 years old neutron star .",
    "if neither one of these two sources is a neutron star and the neutron star hides somewhere else with an even lower x - ray count rate or if only a fraction of the radiation observed from the point - like objects is due to thermal radiation the surface temperature of the neutron star could be even lower .    in principle",
    ", the supernova could have been seen from the far - east astronomers of china , corea or japan or from geographical latitudes further south .",
    "the supernova could have been very bright and then there are records expected to exist , which should be searched for .",
    "if the supernova would have been of the sub - luminous class with a brightness as low as that of sn 1181 and a short peak - plateau duration it could have been missed .",
    "there is some chance that the progenitor star was sufficiently bright and could have been seen by the naked eye .",
    "then the stellar pattern of vela was different in ancient times and the astronomers who monitored the sky might not have noted the supernova as a `` guest star '' or a `` new '' star , because the star was existing and just brightening and eventually fading away",

    "<S> we discuss the implications of the x - ray spectra and of the fact that 1.8 mev @xmath1-ray line emission from the decay of @xmath3al has been measured from the vela region with a certain fraction possibly associated with the new snr . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate an uncertainty of the age of @xmath4 100 yrs for a fixed yield of @xmath2ti . </S>",
    "<S> the highest values of @xmath2ti yield provided by current supernova explosion models give worst case upper limits of 1100 yrs for the age and of 500 pc for the distance . </S>",
    "<S> also the unknown ionization stage of @xmath2ti adds to the uncertainty of age and distance which is at most another 35% on top . </S>",
    "<S> both the energy balance compiled for the remnant and yield predictions for @xmath2ti and @xmath3al by supernova models favour a core - collapse event . </S>",
    "<S> two point sources have been found in the vicinity of the explosion center , either one of these might be the neutron star left by the supernova . </S>",
    "<S> if there is a neutron star the x - ray count rates of the two point sources provide an upper limit of the blackbody surface temperature , which is very unlikely to exceed 3@xmath510@xmath6 k. the supernova might have been observed some 700 @xmath4 150 yrs ago , but based on the data of sn 1181 , e.g. , there is a realistic chance that it has been missed if the supernova was sub - luminous . </S>"
