    "are promising candidates as future electronic devices because of their small size , chemical tunability and self - assembly features . several experimental molecular devices have recently been demonstrated ( for a review of the experimental work see @xcite ) .",
    "these include two terminal devices where the conductance of a molecule coupled to two contacts shows interesting features such as a conductance gap @xcite , asymmetry @xcite and switching @xcite .",
    "molecular devices where a third terminal produces a negative differential resistance @xcite , or suppresses the two terminal current @xcite have been theoretically studied , but most of the work on modeling the current - voltage ( iv ) characteristics of molecular conductors has focused on two - terminal devices ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    the purpose of this paper is to analyze a three - terminal molecular device assuming that the molecule behaves essentially like a rigid solid . unlike solids , molecules are capable of deforming in an external field and it may be possible to take advantage of such conformational effects to design transistors with superior characteristics .",
    "however , in this paper we do not consider this possibility and simply address the question of whether a `` rigid molecule '' used as the conducting channel in a standard three - terminal mosfet configuration can offer any performance advantage relative to a standard silicon mosfet .",
    "although rigorous ab initio models are available in the literature @xcite , they normally do not account for the three - terminal electrostatics that is central to the operation of transistors .",
    "for this reason we have used a simple model hamiltonian whose parameters have been calibrated by comparing with ab initio models .",
    "we believe that a simple model hamiltonian with rigorous electrostatics is preferable to an ab initio hamiltonain with simplified electrostatics since the essential physics of a rigid molecular fet lies in its electrostatics .",
    "the role of electrostatic considerations in the design of conventional silicon mosfets ( with channel lengths ranging from @xmath2 and above ) is well understood . for the gate to have good control of the channel conductivity",
    ", the gate insulator thickness has to be much smaller than the channel length .",
    "also , for a given channel length and gate insulator thickness , a double gated structure is superior to a single gated one , simply by virtue of having two gates as opposed to one .",
    "if a molecule is used as the channel in a standard three - terminal mosfet configuration , the effective channel length is very small - about @xmath0 .",
    "would similar electrostatic considerations apply for such small channel lengths ? in this paper",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "specifically we will show that :    *   the only advantage gained by using a molecular conductor for an fet channel is due to the reduced dielectric constant of the molecular environment . to get good gate control with a single gate",
    "the gate oxide thickness needs to be less than 10% of the channel ( molecule ) length , whereas in conventional mosfets the gate oxide thickness needs to be less than 3% of the channel length @xcite . with a double gated structure , the respective percentages are 60% and 20% @xcite . *",
    "relatively poor subthreshold characteristics ( a _ temperature independent _ subthreshold slope much larger than @xmath1 ) are obtained even with good gate control , if metallic contacts ( like gold ) are used , because the metal - induced gap states in the channel preclude it from turning off abruptly . preliminary results with a molecule coupled to doped silicon source and drain contacts , however , show a temperature dependent subthreshold slope ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we believe this is due to the band - limited nature of the silicon contacts , and we are currently investigating this effect .",
    "overall this study suggests that superior saturation and subthreshold characteristics in a molecular fet can only arise from novel physics beyond that included in our model .",
    "further work on molecular transistors should try to capitalize on the additional degrees of freedom afforded by the `` soft '' nature of molecular conductors @xcite - a feature that is not included in this study .",
    "although there has been no experimental report of a moleculer fet to date , judging from the historical development of the conventional silicon mosfet , it is reasonable to expect that a single gated structure would be easier to fabricate than a double gated one . with this in mind , in this paper we mainly focus on a single gated molecular fet geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "few key results with a double gated geometry will be shown wherever appropriate to emphasize the differences between the single and double gated structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : theory ] contains a brief description of the theoretical formulation and the simulation procedure .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the simulation results along with an explanation of the underlying physics .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes this paper .",
    "a schematic figure of a molecule coupled to gold contacts ( source and drain ) is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme]a . as an example we use the phenyl dithiol ( pdt ) molecule which consists of a phenyl ring with thiol ( -sh ) end groups .",
    "a gate terminal modulates the conductance of the molecule .",
    "we use a simple model hamiltonian @xmath4 to describe the molecule ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]b ) .",
    "the effect of the source and drain contacts is taken into account using self - energy functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "scattering processes may be described using another self - energy matrix @xmath7 . however , in this paper we focus on coherent or ballistic transport ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the source and drain contacts are identified with their respective fermi levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "our simulation consists of iteratively solving a set of coupled equations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]c ) - the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism @xcite equations for the density matrix @xmath11 and the poisson s equation for the self - consistent potential @xmath12 .",
    "given @xmath4 , @xmath12 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the negf formalism has clear prescriptions to obtain the density matrix @xmath11 from which the electron density and the current may be calculated .",
    "once the electron density is calculated we solve the poisson s equation to obtain the self - consistent potential @xmath12 .",
    "the solution procedure thus consists of two iterative steps :    *   * step 1 * : calculate @xmath11 given @xmath12 using negf *   * step 2 * : calculate @xmath12 given @xmath11 using poisson s equation    the above two steps are repeated till neither @xmath12 nor @xmath11 changes from iteration to iteration .",
    "it is worth noting that the self - consistent potential obtained by solving poisson s equation ( eq .  [ eq : poisson ] ) may be augmented by an appropriate exchange - correlation potential that accounts for many electron effects using schemes like hartree - fock ( hf ) or density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not consider the exchange - correlation effects .",
    "the central issue in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is to determine the density matrix @xmath11 ; once it is known , all quantities of interest ( electron density , current etc . )",
    "can be calculated .",
    "a good introductory discussion of the concept of density matrix may be found in @xcite . to obtain the density matrix @xmath11 from the self - consistent potential @xmath12 using the negf formalism",
    ", we need to know the hamiltonian @xmath4 , the contact self - energy matrices @xmath13 and the contact fermi levels @xmath14 . in this section",
    "we describe how we obtain these quantities , and then present a brief outline of the negf equations .",
    "_ hamiltonian _ : we use a simple basis consisting of one @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) orbital on each carbon and sulfur atom .",
    "it is well known that the pdt molecule has @xmath16 conjugation - a cloud of @xmath16 electrons above and below the plane of the molecule that dictate the transport properties of the molecule @xcite .",
    "the on - site energies of our @xmath15 orbitals correspond to the energies of valence atomic @xmath15 orbitals of sulfur and carbon ( apart from a constant shift of all levels which is allowed as it does not affect the wavefunctions ) .",
    "the carbon - carbon interaction energy is @xmath17 which is widely used to describe carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the sulfur - carbon coupling of @xmath18 is empirically determined to obtain a good fit to the ab initio energy levels obtained using the commercially available quantum chemistry software gaussian 98 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pi ] ) .",
    "our model is very similar to the well established @xmath15 orbital based hckel theory used by many quantum chemists .",
    "although we use a simple model hamiltonian to describe the molecule , we believe that the essential qualitative physics and chemistry of the molecule is captured .",
    "this is because both the molecular energy levels and the wavefunctions closely resemble those calculated from a much more sophisticated ab initio theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pi ] ) .    _ self - energy _ :",
    "self - energy formally arises out of partitioning the molecule - contact system into a molecular subsystem and a contact subsystem .",
    "the contact self - energy @xmath19 is calculated knowing the contact surface green s function @xmath20 and the coupling between the molecule and contact @xmath21 . for a molecule coupled to two contacts ( source and drain ) the molecular green s function at an energy @xmath22",
    "is then written as @xcite ( @xmath23 : identity matrix , @xmath4 : molecular hamiltonian , @xmath12 : self - consistent potential ) :    @xmath24^{-1 } \\label{eq : g}\\ ] ]    where the contact self - energy matrices are    @xmath25    we model the gold fcc ( 111 ) contacts using one @xmath26-type orbital on each gold atom . the coupling matrix element between neighboring @xmath26 orbitals is taken equal to @xmath27 - this gives correct surface density of states ( dos ) of @xmath28 for the gold ( 111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "the site energy for each @xmath26 orbital is assumed to be @xmath29 in order to get the correct gold fermi level of @xmath30 .",
    "the surface green s function @xmath20 is calculated using a recursive technique explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "the contact - molecule coupling @xmath21 is determined by the geometry of the contact - molecule bond .",
    "it is believed @xcite that when a thiol - terminated molecule like phenyl dithiol is brought close to a gold substrate , the sulfur bonds with three gold atoms arranged in an equilateral triangle .",
    "for a good contact extended hckel theory predicts a coupling matrix element of about @xmath31 between the sulfur @xmath15 orbital and the three gold @xmath26 orbitals .",
    "however to simulate the bad contacts typically observed in experiments @xcite we reduce the coupling by a factor of five ( this factor is also treated as a parameter , and our results do not change qualitatively for a range of values of this parameter ) .",
    "unlike the hamiltonian , the self - energy matrices are non - hermitian .",
    "the anti - hermitian part of the self - energy , also known as the broadening function :    @xmath32    is related to the lifetime of an electron in a molecular eigenstate .",
    "thus upon coupling to contacts , the molecular density of states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) looks like a set of broadened peaks .    _",
    "where is the fermi energy ?",
    "_ : when a molecule is coupled to contacts there is some charge transfer between the molecule and the contacts , and the contact - molecule - contact system attains equilibrium with one fermi level @xmath33 .",
    "a good question to ask is where @xmath33 lies relative to the molecular energy levels .",
    "the answer is not clear yet , the position of @xmath33 seems to depend on what contact model one uses .",
    "a jellium model @xcite for the contacts predicts that @xmath33 is closer to the lumo level for pdt whereas an extended hckel theory based model @xcite predicts that @xmath33 is closer to the homo level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pi ] and the related caption for a description of homo and lumo levels ) .",
    "our ab initio model @xcite seems to suggest that for gold contacts , @xmath33 ( @xmath30 ) lies a few hundred millivolts above the pdt homo . in this paper",
    "we will use @xmath34 and set the molecular homo level ( obtained from the @xmath16 model ) equal to the ab initio homo level ( @xmath35 ) ( see figs .",

    "once the location of the equilibrium fermi energy @xmath33 is known , we can obtain the source and drain fermi levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 under non - equilibrium conditions ( non - zero @xmath36 ) : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    _ negf equations _ : given @xmath4 , @xmath13 , contact fermi energies @xmath14 and the self - consistent potential @xmath12 , negf has clear prescriptions @xcite to obtain the density matrix @xmath11 .",

    "we assume a nominal charge density @xmath55 obtained by solving the negf equations with @xmath56 ( at @xmath57 ) .",
    "the poisson s equation is then solved for the _ change _ in the charge density ( @xmath58 ) from the nominal value @xmath59 :    @xmath60    the poisson ( or hartree ) potential @xmath61 may be augmented by an appropriate exchange - correlation potential @xmath62 . in this paper",

    "we have two schemes to solve the poisson s equation : ( 1 ) simple capacitance model and ( 2 ) rigorous numerical solution over a 2d grid in real space .    _ capacitance model _ : we use a simplified picture of the molecule as a quantum dot with some nominal _ total _ charge @xmath64 ( at @xmath57 ) and some average potential @xmath61 arising because of the _ change _ @xmath65 in this nominal charge due to the applied bias .",

    "[ fig : beta ] ) .",
    "the particular solution @xmath67 may be written in terms of a charging energy @xmath81 as :    @xmath82    the charging energy is treated as a parameter , and may be estimated as follows .",
    "the capacitance of a sphere of radius @xmath83 is @xmath84 .",
    "if we distribute a charge of one electron on this sphere , the potential of the sphere is @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath86 the value of this potential is about @xmath87 .",
    "thus we use a charging energy @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath81 is the charging energy per electron per molecule and may also be estimated from the numerical grid solution by finding the average potential in the region occupied by the molecule and carrying one electronic charge distributed equally .",
    "this numerical procedure also yields @xmath88 and is used to estimate the charging energy while comparing the capacitance model with the numerical grid solution ( see fig .",

    "the self - consistent potential that adds to the @xmath15 hamiltonian ( see eq .",

    "the applied gate , source and drain voltages provide the boundary conditions .",
    "we use a dielectric constant of 3.9 for silicon dioxide and 2 for the self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) @xcite .    the correct procedure to obtain the real space charge density @xmath54 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : poisson ] ) from the @xmath15 orbital space density matrix @xmath11 is to make use of eq .",
    "[ eq : nofr ] . however , we simplify the calculation of @xmath54 by observing that a carbon or sulfur @xmath15 orbital has a spread of about five to six bohr radii ( 1 bohr radius @xmath90 ) .",

    "the solution to poisson s equation yields the real space potential distribution .",
    "however , the self - consistent potential @xmath12 that needs to be added to the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ eq : g ] ) is in the @xmath15 orbital space .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is a diagonal matrix with each diagonal entry as the value of the real space solution @xmath61 at the appropriate atomic position .",
    "for example , the diagonal entry in @xmath12 corresponding to the sulfur based @xmath15 orbital would be equal to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the position vector of the sulfur atom .",
    "the self - consistent procedure ( fig .  [ fig : scheme]c ) is done with the two types of poisson solutions discussed above . the simple capacitance model is fast while the 2d numerical solution is slow but more accurate .",
    "the capacitance model has two parameters , namely @xmath80 which is a measure of the gate control , and @xmath81 which is the charging energy .",
    "these parameters can be extracted using the 2d numerical solution .",
    "we will first present results with the capacitance model by assuming ideal gate control , or @xmath78 .",
    "this ideal case is useful to explain the current saturation mechanism .",
    "we will then compare the results obtained from the capacitance model with those obtained from the numerical solution , and show that the two match reasonably well .",
    "[ fig : ideal_iv ] shows the molecular iv characteristic obtained by self - consistently solving the coupled negf - capacitance model poisson s equations .",
    "we contrast the iv for ideal gate control ( @xmath78 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal_iv]a , b ) with that for no gate control ( @xmath77 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal_iv]c , d ) . for each case , we have shown the iv for positive as well as negative drain voltage .",
    "we observe the following :    * with ideal gate control the iv is asymmetric with respect to the drain bias . for positive drain bias ,",
    "we see very little gate modulation of the current . for negative drain bias",
    "we see current saturation and good gate modulation - the iv looks like that of a mosfet . * with no gate control the iv is symmetric with respect to the drain bias .",
    "there is no gate modulation .",
    "these features of the iv characteristic may be understood as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the ideal gate case . since the gate is held at a fixed potential _ with respect to the source _ , the molecular dos does not shift relative to the source fermi level @xmath9 as the drain bias is changed , which is typically the case . for high charging energies the particular solution @xmath67 can dominate the laplace solution @xmath66 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : ul],[eq : up ] and related discussion ) , thereby reducing gate control . ] . for negative drain bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism]a ) , the drain fermi level @xmath10 moves up ( towards the lumo ) with respect to the molecular dos . since the drain current depends on the dos lying between the source and drain fermi levels , the current saturates for increasing negative drain bias because the tail of the dos dies out as the drain fermi level moves towards the lumo .",
    "if the gate bias is now made more negative , the molecular levels shift up relative to the source fermi level , thereby bringing in more dos in the energy range between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( referred to as the @xmath9-@xmath10 window from now on ) , and the current increases .",
    "thus we get current saturation and gate modulation .    for positive drain bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism]b ) , @xmath10 moves down ( towards the homo ) with respect to the molecular dos .",
    "the current increases with positive drain bias because more and more dos is coming inside the @xmath9-@xmath10 window as @xmath10 moves towards the homo peak .",
    "once @xmath10 crosses the homo peak , the current levels off .",
    "this is the resonant tunneling mechanism .",
    "if the gate bias is now made more negative , no appreciable change is made in the dos inside the @xmath9-@xmath10 window , and the maximum current remains almost independent of the gate bias .",
    "now let us contrast this with the case where no gate is present . in this case ,",
    "due to the applied drain bias @xmath36 , the molecular dos floats up by roughly @xmath96 with respect to the source fermi level .",
    "for either negative ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism]c ) or positive ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism]d ) drain bias , the current flow mechanism is resonant tunneling . since the equilibrium fermi energy lies closer to the homo , for negative drain bias @xmath9 crosses homo while for positive drain bias @xmath10 crosses homo @xcite .",
    "no gate modulation is seen as expected , and the iv is symmetric with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : subth ] shows the log scale drain current as a function of gate bias at high drain bias . we note that despite assuming ideal gate control , the subthreshold slope of this molecular fet is about @xmath97 which is much worse than the ideal room temperature @xmath98 that a good mosfet can come close to achieving .",
    "it is also worth noting here that our simulation is done at low temperature - the subthreshold slope of the molecular fet is _ temperature independent _ and only depends on the molecular dos as explained below .",
    "the poor subthreshold slope may be understood as follows . as the gate voltage is made more positive , the molecular dos shifts down with respect to the @xmath9-@xmath10 window .",
    "the homo peak thus moves away from the @xmath9-@xmath10 window , and fewer states are available to carry the current .",
    "the rate at which the current decreases with increasing positive gate bias thus depends on the rate at which the tail of the dos in the homo - lumo gap dies away with increasing energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "typically we find that the tail of the dos dies away at the rate of several hundred milli electron - volts of energy per decade , and this slow fall in the dos determines the subthreshold slope .",
    "the slow fall in the molecular dos may be attributed to the metal - induced gap ( mig ) states - the gold source and drain contacts have a sizeable dos near the fermi energy , and are separated only by a few angstroms .",
    "( @xmath99 at room temperature ) for ballistic si mosfets @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for a molecular fet with doped silicon source and drain contacts do show a subthreshold slope proportional to @xmath100 ; we are currently investigating this effect .",
    "] since the molecule is assumed to be rigid , the molecular dos has no temperature dependence and hence neither does the subthreshold slope .",
    "thus the molecular fet with a rigid molecule acting as the channel is a very poor switching device even with ideal gate control .",
    "the 2d numerical poisson s solution may be used to estimate the gate control as follows . from eq .",
    "[ eq : ul ] we see that    @xmath101    thus @xmath80 may be estimated from the numerical solution by slightly changing @xmath102 ( keeping @xmath36 constant ) and calculating how much the laplace s solution changes over the region occupied by the molecule .",
    "a plot of @xmath80 calculated using this method as a function of the gate oxide thickness @xmath103 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : beta ] .",
    "knowing that the channel length ( length of the pdt molecule ) is about @xmath0 , it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] that in order to get good gate control ( @xmath104 ) the gate oxide thickness ( @xmath103 ) needs to be about one tenth of the channel length ( @xmath105 ) , or about @xmath106 !",
    "thus we need @xmath107 to get a good molecular fet . in a well - designed conventional bulk mosfet , @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "this difference between a molecular fet and a conventional fet may be understood by noting that the dielectric constant of the molecular environment ( = 2 ) is about 6 times smaller than that of silicon ( = 11.7 ) @xcite .",
    "[ fig : beta ] also shows @xmath80 as a function of @xmath103 calculated using the 2d numerical laplace s solution over a double gated molecular fet structure . in this case , we find that to get good gate control , we need @xmath109 . thus a double gated structure is superior to a single gated one for a given @xmath105 and @xmath103 , as is also expected for conventional silicon mosfets .",
    "the reason for this is simply that two gates can better control the channel than one .",
    "[ fig : compare ] compares the iv characteristic obtained by solving the self - consistent negf - poisson s equations with the numerical poisson s solution and the capacitance model .",
    "the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the capacitance model were extracted from the numerical solution .",
    "we see a reasonable agreement between the two solutions despite the simplifications made in the capacitance model ( the capacitance model assumes a flat potential profile in the region occupied by the molecule , which may not be true , especially at high bias ) . for @xmath110 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : compare]a ) there is very little gate modulation and no saturation as expected . in this case",
    "@xmath111 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : compare]a .",
    "we have also calculated the iv characteristics with a double gated geometry ( not shown here ) , and as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] , saturating ivs can be obtained for more realistic oxide thicknesses ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "we have presented simulation results for a three terminal molecular device with a rigid molecule acting as the channel in a standard mosfet configuration .",
    "the negf equations for quantum transport are self - consistently solved with the poisson s equation .",
    "we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "the current - voltage ( iv ) characteristics of molecular conductors are strongly influenced by the electrostatics , just like conventional semiconductors . with good gate control",
    ", the iv characteristics will saturate for one polarity of the drain bias and increase monotonically if the polarity is reversed .",
    "by contrast two - terminal symmetric molecules typically show symmetric iv characteristics",
    "the only advantage gained by using a molecular conductor for an fet channel is due to the reduced dielectric constant of the molecular environment . to get good gate control with a single gate",
    "the gate oxide thickness needs to be less than 10% of the channel ( molecule ) length , whereas in conventional mosfets the gate oxide thickness needs to be less than 3% of the channel length . with a double gated structure , the respective percentages are 60% and 20% .",
    "relatively poor subthreshold characteristics ( a _ temperature independent _ subthreshold slope much larger than @xmath1 ) are obtained even with good gate control , if metallic contacts ( like gold ) are used , because the metal - induced gap states in the channel preclude it from turning off abruptly .",
    "preliminary results with a molecule coupled to doped silicon source and drain contacts , however , show a temperature dependent subthreshold slope ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we believe this is due to the band - limited nature of the silicon contacts , and we are currently investigating this effect .",
    "overall this study suggests that superior saturation and subthreshold characteristics in a molecular fet can only arise from novel physics beyond that included in our model .",
    "further work on molecular transistors should try to exploit the additional degrees of freedom afforded by the `` soft '' ( as opposed to rigid ) nature of molecular conductors @xcite .",

    "<S> this paper addresses the question of whether a `` rigid molecule '' ( one which does not deform in an external field ) used as the conducting channel in a standard three - terminal mosfet configuration can offer any performance advantage relative to a standard silicon mosfet </S>",
    "<S> . a self - consistent solution of coupled quantum transport and poisson s equations shows that even for extremely small channel lengths ( about @xmath0 ) , a `` well - tempered '' molecular fet demands much the same electrostatic considerations as a `` well - tempered '' conventional mosfet . in other words , we show that just as in a conventional mosfet , the gate oxide thickness needs to be much smaller than the channel length ( length of the molecule ) for the gate control to be effective . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that a rigid molecule with metallic source and drain contacts has a temperature independent subthreshold slope much larger than @xmath1 , because the metal - induced gap states in the channel prevent it from turning off abruptly </S>",
    "<S> . however , this disadvantage can be overcome by using semiconductor contacts because of their band - limited nature .    </S>",
