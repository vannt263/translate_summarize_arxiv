    "the ozone molecule plays a crucial role in the physics and chemistry of the earth atmosphere .",
    "however , a lot remains to be understood , especially about its formation , which is thought to take place in two steps @xcite .",
    "firstly , an oxygen atom o and an oxygen molecule o@xmath2 collide to give a ro - vibrationally or electronically excited ozone complex o@xmath3 .",
    "secondly , this complex stabilizes by inelastic collision with one surrounding atom or molecule , which is the so - called _ deactivation _ process",
    ". however , this second step takes place provided that the excited complex o@xmath3 does not dissociate into o@xmath4o@xmath2 before colliding with the surrounding gas .",
    "characterizing the competition between deactivation on the one hand , and dissociation on the other hand , is the key point in order to understand quantitatively the ozone formation in the atmosphere .    in this respect ,",
    "one of the most striking features of ozone physical chemistry is the unconventional isotopic effects that influence the competition between stabilization and dissociation of o@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it became clear in recent years @xcite , that these isotopic effects were determined by the difference of zero - point energies @xmath5 of the o@xmath2 isotopologues in the entrance and the dissociation channels .",
    "if @xmath6 , dissociation is energetically unfavorable : the o@xmath3 has a higher lifetime , and so is more likely to give stable o@xmath7 . on the contrary , if @xmath8 , dissociation is energetically favorable , and it tends to dominate stabilization .",
    "the unconventional isotopic effects were very well understood in the beginning of the 2000 s within the framework of the statistical rkrm ( rice - kassel - ramsperger - marcus ) theory @xcite .",
    "however , an adjustable parameter @xmath9 had to be added to that theory , in order to account for deviation from the energy equipartition theorem , after the formation of the o@xmath3 molecule .",
    "then , the need for first - principle studies of the ozone formation , especially based on quantum mechanics , became obvious .",
    "since a full quantum treatment of the two - step process is beyond the possibilities offered by current computers , researchers are urged to focus on precise aspects of the process , _",
    "e.g. _ highly - excited vibrational levels of o@xmath7 @xcite , the influence of resonances @xcite , or to use less demanding computational techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ classical - trajectory @xcite or mixed - quantum - classical calculations @xcite .",
    "the common features of all those studies is that they need a reliable potential energy surface ( pes ) , at least for the electronic ground state @xmath10 .",
    "since the formation of stable o@xmath7 involves a wide variety of geometries , from almost separated o and o@xmath2 , to tightly bound o@xmath7 , one actually needs a _ global _ pes . up to now , all the published pess share the same general features .",
    "in particular when they are cut along the minimum - energy path , they all show a change in character between the inner and the asymptotic regions , which is due to an avoided crossing with an excited electronic state , also referred to as the transition state .",
    "however , there is still a controversy on whether this avoided crossing induces a potential barrier that goes above @xcite or below the dissociation limit @xcite , or on the contrary , a monotonic evolution of the potential energy as suggested by the most recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite .",
    "up to now , all the articles that aimed at describing the o@xmath11o@xmath2 asymptotic region were based on quantum - chemical calculations of the ground - state and possibly the lowest excited - states pess of o@xmath7 @xcite . in the present paper , we propose an alternative method based on the multipolar expansion of the electrostatic potential energy between o and o@xmath2 , both in their electronic ground state .",
    "this method enables us to obtain , in a single calculation , the 27 spin - orbit pess connected to the dissociation threshold o@xmath12o@xmath13 . the calculated pess are then functions of the electric properties , _",
    "i.e. _ multipole moments and multipole polarizabilities , of the separated systems .",
    "this method is valid provided that the electronic clouds of o and o@xmath2 do not overlap , that is for a o ",
    "o@xmath2 distance larger than 8 bohr .",
    "such asymptotic pess can then be used as a tool to check the quality of the _ ab initio _ pess .    in this article , we use two complementary approaches to characterize the o@xmath11o@xmath2 long - range interactions . in section",
    "[ sec : fixedgeom ] , we consider the atom and the diatom at _ fixed _ geometries , that is at given inter - particle distances and bending angles .",
    "the obtained pess can be directly connected to _",
    "ab initio _ pess . in section",
    "[ sec : o2-rovib ] , we include in our model the vibration and rotation of o@xmath2 which yields one - dimensional potential energy curves ( pecs ) depending on the o  o@xmath2 distance .",
    "such curves are relevant for the low energy dynamics of the o  o@xmath2 complex , in particular to which extent the rotation of o@xmath2 is hindered by the presence of o. these curves are also useful for modeling the vibrational levels of ozone close to its dissociation limit @xcite .",
    "we discuss in section [ sec : discussion ] the way to connect both approaches which is done for the first time , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions and prospects .",
    "as the two ground state particles o and o@xmath14 are far away from each other , _ i.e. _ their electronic clouds do not overlap , we use the jacobi coordinates to describe the pess . the body - fixed frame associated to the o ",
    "o@xmath2 complex has its @xmath15 axis connecting o to the center of mass of o@xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath16 axis is perpendicular to the @xmath15 axis and is located in the plane of the three atoms ; the @xmath17 axis is perpendicular to this plane .",
    "we also introduce the coordinate system @xmath18 linked to the o@xmath14 diatom .",
    "the axes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related to @xmath15 and @xmath16 by a rotation of angle @xmath21 about the @xmath22 axis .",
    "we denote as @xmath23 the interatomic distance in the o@xmath14 molecule , and @xmath24 the distance between the o atom and the center of mass of o@xmath14 .",
    "the formalism presented in this section allows for calculating three - dimensional pess depending on @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 . in the following , we set @xmath25 ( @xmath26  nm is the bohr radius and the atomic unit for distances ) at the equilibrium distance of o@xmath14 without loss of generality for our purpose .",
    "the calculations below are based on the formalism described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and used in ref .",
    "the quantities referring to o and o@xmath14 are respectively characterized by the subscripts `` @xmath27 '' after `` atom '' and `` @xmath28 '' after `` diatom '' .",
    "the starting point of our model is the multipole expansion in inverse powers of @xmath24 of the electrostatic energy between two charge distributions `` @xmath27 '' and `` @xmath28 '' ( see @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xcite @xmath31 in eq .",

    "the multipole moments of the diatom is conveniently expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the multipole moment operator of the diatom expressed in the @xmath18 coordinate system , and @xmath41 is the reduced wigner function , which characterizes the rotation from the @xmath18 to the @xmath38 frame .    the multipolar expansion ( [ eq : vad ] ) is valid provided that the electronic wave functions of o and o@xmath2 do not overlap",
    ". this condition is fulfilled for distances @xmath24 larger than the so - called leroy radius @xcite @xmath42 , where the mean squared radius of the electronic wave function in o is @xmath43 .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 is roughly evaluated from the equilibrium distance @xmath45 of o@xmath2 and the mean radius of the electronic wave function in o @xmath46 .    in this work , we calculate the two leading terms of the @xmath47 expansion for @xmath48 : the first - order term reflecting the interaction between the permanent quadrupole moments of o and o@xmath14 ( @xmath49 ) scaling as @xmath50 , and the second - order ( van der waals ) term related to the interaction between the induced dipole moments ( @xmath51 ) scaling as @xmath52 . while generally tedious to obtain from _ ab initio _ calculations higher - order contributions may also be significant around @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , assuming that the maximal values of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 coefficients for the o - o@xmath2 interaction are half of those for @xmath56-@xmath56 @xcite ) we obtain @xmath57  a.u .",
    "( close to the values obtained in the present work , see next section ) and @xmath58  a.u .. at @xmath59 the @xmath55 term would then represent at most 64% of the @xmath54 one and 41% at @xmath60 .",
    "therefore our work provides the essentials of the long - range interaction between o and o@xmath2 . in order to match the present asymptotic expansions to the _ ab initio _ calculations ,",
    "the safest way is to use the @xmath61 and @xmath54 values determined below to fit the long - range part of the _ ab initio _ pess beyond @xmath53 and to extract the related higher - order terms .",
    "another possibility would be to directly compute the next term @xmath55 , but this beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the oxygen atom is in an arbitrary fine - structure level @xmath62 of its ground state @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the total angular momentum with projection @xmath65 on the @xmath15 axis , resulting from the sum of the projections @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the orbital @xmath68 and spin @xmath69 angular momenta of the atom , respectively .",
    "since the spin - orbit constant @xmath70 of oxygen is negative ( @xmath71   @xmath72 ) , the @xmath73 fine - structure level is the lowest in energy .",
    "the ground electronic state @xmath74 of o@xmath2 has an orbital angular momentum projection @xmath75 on the @xmath19 axis and a spin @xmath76 with projection @xmath77 on @xmath19 .",
    "the fine structure in the o@xmath2 energy spectrum induced by the spin - spin interaction writes @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ( @xmath23-dependent ) spin - spin constant , with @xmath80  @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the electric multipole moments of o and o@xmath14 only depends on the spatial coordinates of the electrons and the nuclei so that we will ignore the o@xmath2 fine structure in the following . assuming an energy origin at the @xmath73 oxygen level and at the o@xmath2 ground level , the zeroth - order energy is @xmath81 corresponding to the unperturbed state vectors @xmath82 .",

    "in this article , we have characterized the potential energy surfaces ( pess ) of the ozone molecule at large distances , where o and o@xmath2 weakly interact with each other , using two different approaches .",
    "our calculations are based on the multipolar expansion of the electrostatic potential energy , which is expressed in terms of the electric properties of o and o@xmath2 .",
    "firstly , we have calculated the 27 asymptotic electronic pess correlated to the o@xmath0o@xmath13 dissociation limit including spin - orbit couplings .",
    "all the pess are found attractive due to the dominant isotropic van der waals interaction .",
    "for all spin - orbit states , the minimum energy is observed for a linear configuration of the three oxygen atoms .",

    "the overlap of the long - range and _ ab initio _",
    "pess on a large enough range of distances in the region of the leroy radius should avoid the tedious calculation of higher order terms in the multipolar expansion .",
    "secondly , we have considered the interaction between an o@xmath13 molecule in a given spin - orbit state , vibrating in the ground level and rotating in a low level and an o@xmath0 atom .",
    "we obtained one - dimensional potential energy curves ( pecs ) dominated by the isotropic van der waals interaction .",
    "they are nearly parallel , which indicates that , when o and o@xmath2 approach each other , the rotation of o@xmath2 is only weakly hindered by the presence of o at distances larger than the leroy radius .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this hypothesis is generally assumed in models characterizing the transition state , which is located at smaller distances , in the o+o@xmath2 exchange reaction @xcite .",
    "however , such an hypothesis of weakly hindered rotation is not always appropriate , as demonstrated for instance in the long - range interaction between a cesium atom and a ground state cs@xmath2 molecule @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional pec above can be smoothly matched to an arbitrary potential curve below the leroy radius so that vibrational energies and wavefunctions ( along the o  o@xmath2 axis ) can be calculated in the frame attached to the trimer ( _ i.e. _  neglecting the mutual rotation of o and o@xmath2 .",
    "they will be of relevance for estimating the density of vibrational levels of the o  o@xmath2 system close to the dissociation limit , namely with binding energy smaller than the remaining potential energy @xmath148",
    "@xmath72 around the leroy radius .",
    "such wavefunctions will be mostly concentrated at large distances , since the potential energy around the o@xmath7 global minimum is by far larger than @xmath149 .",
    "once experimental energies are available near the dissociation limit , one could tune the potential energy in the inner zone in order to match the calculated energies to the observed one , and thus characterize the related energy levels with quantum numbers of the o  o@xmath2 system .",
    "furthermore , such pecs could be of interest for the study of o ",
    "o@xmath2 collisions in the cold ( @xmath150 k ) or ultracold ( @xmath150 mk ) regimes .",
    "several theoretical studies already aimed at modeling collisions involving oxygen @xcite , while several experimental investigations suggested possible ways to create beams of cold atomic or molecular oxygen @xcite . in particular , we can expect such collisions to exhibit _ rotational _ unconventional isotopic effects . if the difference in rotational energy compensates the difference in vibrational zero - point energy , we obtain two quasi - degenerate channels of different isotopologues .",
    "in addition , the nuclear - spin symmetry can also play an important part in the rotational isotopic effects , as it forbids some rotational levels .",
    "for example , the channels @xmath151 and @xmath152 on the one hand , and @xmath153 and @xmath154 on the other hand , are only separated by 0.2 @xmath72 ; but the second situation is not allowed , as @xmath155 has no even rotational levels .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in contrast with similar studies devoted to low energy atom exchange reactions in atom - diatom systems ( for instance al+o@xmath2 @xcite , c+oh @xcite , or o+oh @xcite ) , the adiabatic capture centrifugal theory  @xcite conducted in the sudden approximation ( accsa )  @xcite relying on the unique knowledge of the long - range asymptotic ground state potential energy of the atom - diatom system can not be used in the ozone case , due to the presence of the transition state playing a role at distances lower than the leroy radius , and thus beyond the validity of the present approach .",
    "a calculation within this model would undoubtedly lead to an overestimation of the atom exchange rate .",
