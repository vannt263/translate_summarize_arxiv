    "we plot @xmath106 as a function of @xmath110 in figure  [ fig_vvm ] .",

    "we note that the above argument does not depend on @xmath13 so much .",
    "the behavior of the weight function @xmath100 is shown in figure  [ fig_weight ] .",
    "when @xmath42 is large enough for @xmath77 to be smaller than @xmath111 or when @xmath42 is small enough , @xmath100 is small since @xmath87 or the solid angle factor are relatively small in the range @xmath113 .",
    "one can see that in the case of @xmath107 , @xmath100 takes the maximum value at @xmath114 , when @xmath115 .",
    "above discussions show that the sources with the viewing angle @xmath116 at @xmath117 are the most frequent class of the xrfs in the population for the opening half - angle @xmath107 .",
    "in other cases in which @xmath13 is smaller than 0.03 , the typical values are @xmath117 and @xmath118 since @xmath100 takes maximum at @xmath119 ( see table  [ tablevvm ] ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath105 for the emission from a simple jet model , and shown that when the jet opening half - angle @xmath13 is smaller than about 0.03 , @xmath105 for the xrfs detected by wfcs on _ bepposax _ is smaller than 0.4 . the value of @xmath120 has been obtained from the fitting of the afterglow light curve ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ; frail et al .",
    "such a narrow jet which is inferred by afterglow observations is rare .",
    "however , following eq .",
    "( 1 ) of frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the jet break time is given by @xmath121  minutes and so it requires fast localization to observe the jet break for a narrow jet .",
    "therefore , at present , the small number of grbs with small @xmath13 may come from the observational selection effect . in the context of this scenario",
    ", we might be able to account for the fact that afterglows of xrfs have been rarely observed since the afterglow at a fixed time gets dimmer for an earlier break time .",
    "furthermore , some `` dark grbs '' might be such a small opening angle jet observed with an on - axis viewing angle for the same reason .",
    "we briefly comment on how the results obtained in this paper will depend on the lorentz factor of the jet @xmath67 .",
    "we see that when @xmath67 becomes large , @xmath105 becomes small . for example , when we fix @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "[ sec : vvm ] , we have shown that for fixed @xmath104 , the typical value of @xmath42 is @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , for the adopted parameters @xmath132kev and the typical redshift @xmath133 , one can derive @xmath134 kev , which is the typical observed peak energy of the xrfs ( kippen et al .",
    "we can propose from our argument that the emissions from the jets with a small opening half - angle such as @xmath104 are observed as xrfs when they are seen from off - axis viewing angle .",
    "if one can detect the afterglow of the xrf , which has the maximum flux at about several hours after the xrf , the fitting of light curve may give us the key information about the jet opening angle ( granot et al .",
    "therefore , our theoretical model can be tested by the near - future observations .",
    "we can estimate the observed event rate of the xrf for fixed @xmath13 as , @xmath135 in order to calculate @xmath136 , we consider the proportionality constant @xmath137 .",
    "one can write approximately as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the number of stars with masses @xmath140 per unit mass . since we assume all stars with masses @xmath140",
    "explode as core - collapse sne , @xmath141 represents the ratio of the number of xrf sources to that of core - collapse sne .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath142 , which is derived by the result of porciani & madau ( 2001 ) combined with the effect of the solid angle factor @xmath143 . using a salpeter initial",
    "mass function @xmath144 , we obtain @xmath145 .",
    "then , in the case of @xmath107 , we derive @xmath146 , which is comparable to the observed event rate of the xrf ( heise et al . 2001 ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath136 remains unchanged within a factor of 2 when we vary @xmath13 from 0.01 to 0.07 .",
    "when the jet opening half - angle @xmath13 has a distribution @xmath147 , we integrate @xmath105 and @xmath136 over the distribution of @xmath13 as @xmath148 @xmath149 respectively .",
    "we assume a power - low distribution as @xmath150 . when we adopt @xmath151 ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) , and integrate over @xmath13 from 0.01 to 0.2 rad , we find @xmath152 and @xmath153  events  yr@xmath28 .",
    "these values mainly depend on the lower bound of the integration .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath154 and @xmath155  events  yr@xmath28 if the integration is done over @xmath13 from 0.03 to 0.2 rad ( note that we may let the value of @xmath156 be consistent with observed value by adjusting @xmath157 ) . since the statistics of the observational data will increase in the near future owing to instruments such as _ hete-2 _ and _ swift _",
