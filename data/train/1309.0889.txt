    "quantum hall edge states are not only responsible for the dissipationless quantized hall transport , but also provide a unique window to study the highly non - trivial topological properties of the bulk .",
    "for example , it was predicted that for a large class of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states , their edges exhibit _ universal _ low - energy properties that directly reflect the bulk topological order.@xcite on the other hand various complications , generally referred to as edge reconstruction , can happen at the edge due to interplay between confining potential ( which tends to hold electrons together ) and coulomb repulsion between electrons ( that tends to spread out electron charge).@xcite it was shown in earlier numerical work@xcite that fqh edges are much more susceptible to reconstruction as compared to their integer counterparts . when edge reconstruction occurs gapless edge modes _ not _ required by bulk topological order appear , and they can ruin the predicted universality.@xcite    earlier work@xcite on fqh edge reconstruction has mostly ignored the electron spin degree of freedom ( perhaps the only exception is ref . ) . on the other hand",
    "it is known that spin can play a very active role at the edges of integer quantum liquids.@xcite motivated by this we study the effects of confining potential , electron - electron interaction , and zeeman splitting on the charge and spin structures at the edge of fqh liquids , by carrying out exact diagonalization calculations on small electron systems using disk geometry .",
    "the model and numerical methods are similar as the ones used in our earlier work on the spin structure of integer quantum hall edges.@xcite more specifically , we study fqh liquids with filling factors @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , subject to positive background charge confining potential , briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "we also study filling factor @xmath5 , which is of very strong current interest . in this case",
    "we use a model similar to refs . , but also include spin degrees of freedom .",
    "details will be discussed in sec .",
    "ii .    in our numerical studies ,",
    "edge reconstruction is triggered by a level crossing between the ground state and an edge excited state ( before reconstruction ) , or equivalently , softening of an edge mode .",
    "depending on whether this ( softened ) excitation belongs to charge or spin edge mode , we can distinguish the reconstruction as charge or spin edge reconstructions .",
    "therefore we need to know about all the edge excitations of a fqh liquid before studying how they lead to edge reconstructions . within the framework of composite fermion ( cf ) theory@xcite , we can map some of the fqh filling factors to corresponding integer quantum hall fillings of cfs , and use knowledge and intuition obtained from earlier extensive studies of these integer quantum hall states edges .",
    "for example spin - polarized @xmath0 state can be mapped onto filling factor @xmath6 of composite fermions .",
    "therefore we expect that it has a non - chiral edge spin wave ( esw ) mode and a forward - moving ( chiral ) edge magnetoplasmon ( emp ) mode as the @xmath7 spin - polarized state.@xcite spin - unpolarized @xmath1 and @xmath2 fqh states are mapped onto filling factor @xmath8 of composite fermions , with effective magnetic field parallel and antiparallel to the original external field respectively . as a result @xmath1 state",
    "has one forward - moving esw mode and one forward - moving emp mode as @xmath9 state.@xcite the situation of the @xmath2 state is less trivial , and detailed study@xcite shows that it has one backward - moving esw mode and one forward - moving emp mode . at @xmath10 , we find electrons in the half - filled 1st excited landau level condense into the spin - polarized moore - read pfaffian state in certain range of confining strength .",
    "similar to spin - polarized @xmath0 state , the @xmath3 state has a non - chiral esw mode and a forward - moving ( chiral ) emp .",
    "in addition , it also has a forward - moving ( chiral ) edge majorana fermion ( emf ) mode.@xcite the intuitions of some qualitative properties of edge reconstruction , like the relation between the directions of the edge reconstructing mode and confining strength , can be obtained from an electrostatic model described in our previous work.@xcite    our most robust results are summarized as follows . without zeeman coupling , spin - polarized @xmath0 laughlin - like state , spin - unpolarized @xmath1 , @xmath2",
    "halperin - like states and spin - polarized moore - read pfaffian state appear as ground states in certain regions of confining strength at corresponding filling factors .",
    "the non - chiral esws of spin - polarized @xmath0 state can be mapped onto @xmath11 bosons on top of the spin - polarized @xmath0 state ; the chiral esws of spin - unpolarized @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be mapped onto the pure spin excitations predicted by su(@xmath8 ) effective theory.@xcite in the spectra obtained by exact diagonalization , these esw modes are low - lying and well separated from the other edge charge modes and bulk excitations .",
    "for each abelian fqh liquid ( @xmath12 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) , edge reconstruction is triggered by softening of esw mode if the corresponding esw mode exists , indicating their importance . on the other hand , for the spin - polarized moore - read pfaffian state , we find spin plays _ no _ role in its instabilities when confining potential strength is varied within our model .",
    "we also find that it is an emp excitation that reconstructs the pfaffian state at the smoother confinement side .",
    "the critical parameters of all the instabilities are identified in accessible finite size systems , and also estimated for the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the effects of zeeman coupling are discussed whenever appropriate .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the models and provide some numerical details of the exact diagonalization calculation . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the edge excitations and instabilities of the abelian fqh liquids ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 fqh liquids ) in finite size systems .",
    "iv considers the instabilities of the pfaffian state in finite size systems .",
    "some conclusions and remarks are offered in sec .",
    "we consider interplay of two - body coulomb interaction , one - body rotationally invariant confining potential and zeeman coupling in our problem . for studying the fqh states with electrons confined to the lowest landau level ( lll ) ( relevant for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states )",
    ", the complete hamiltonian in the symmetric gauge is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electron creation operator for the lll single - electron state with orbital angular momentum @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the occupation number operator of the @xmath15th orbital with spin @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath18 is the bohr magneton and @xmath19 is the electron spin @xmath19 factor .",
    "@xmath20 are the corresponding matrix elements of coulomb interaction for the symmetric gauge , and @xmath21 are the matrix elements of the rotationally invariant confining potential .",
    "we assume a uniformly distributed neutralizing positive background charge layer at a distance @xmath22 above the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) to model the real 2deg s confinement of a modulation - doped algaas / gaas heterostructure .",
    "therefore @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the charge density of the background , and @xmath25 is the dielectric constant .",
    "@xmath26 is the dimensionless ratio that tunes the relative strength between confining potential and electron - electron interaction .",
    "in addition we assume there is a sharp cleaved edge,@xcite and model its effect by restricting the lll orbitals to those with angular momentum from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ( we make @xmath29 when study the @xmath2 state for a reason discussed later ) .",
    "additional details of this model can be found in ref . and also our previous work for integer quantum hall states.@xcite total angular momentum @xmath30 , total spin @xmath31 and its z - axis component @xmath32 are good quantum numbers , because the hamiltonian ( [ completeh ] ) has rotational symmetry and also commutes with @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "to study the @xmath3 state , we use the same treatment as in refs . .",
    "we explicitly keep the electronic states in the half - filled first landau level ( 1ll ) and neglect the spin up and down electrons in the lll by assuming that they are inert . the amount of charge in the positive background charge disk is chosen to neutralize the electrons charge in the 1ll .",
    "the disk encloses exactly @xmath34 magnetic flux quanta , in which @xmath35 is the number of electrons in the 1ll . with this simplification ,",
    "the hamiltonian used to study @xmath3 state still has the form of ( [ completeh ] ) .",
    "but there are some differences : @xmath15 labels the @xmath15th orbital in the 1ll ; @xmath20 , @xmath36 are the corresponding matrix elements of coulomb interaction and confining potential for the electronic states of the 1ll .    in gaas ,",
    "coulomb interaction dominates the zeeman coupling energy in the magnetic fields of interest .",
    "we will treat the zeeman coupling in a similar way as our previous study of integer quantum hall states.@xcite at first the zeeman term is ignored when studying the edge spin excitations .",
    "so for each energy level with quantum number @xmath31 , it has degeneracy @xmath37 with different values of @xmath32 .",
    "when the zeeman term is added back , the eigenstates will not change , but the original degenerate energy levels will be split corresponding to different @xmath32 .",
    "we will also consider the effects of such splitting in the following .",
    "in this section , we study the edge excitations and reconstructions of spin - polarized @xmath0 laughlin - like state , and spin - unpolarized @xmath1 , @xmath2 halperin - like states .",
    "all these three fqh states appear as ground states in certain regions of corresponding parameter spaces .",
    "we also find that in the absence of zeeman splitting , in all cases edge reconstruction is triggered by softening of esw mode if the corresponding esw exists .",

    "[ rdis_v13_n7 ] , we verified that these esws do have spin textures localized at the edge .",
    "besides the esw mode , the well studied emp mode merges into the bulk excitations in the spectra of small systems because of its high velocity .    with changing confining potential ,",
    "the softening of esws reconstructs the edge of spin - polarized @xmath0 state at both smoother and stronger confinement sides as shown in fig .",

    "[ phase_diagram_v13_pbg ] ) , we can deduce that with further smoothing ( strengthening ) confinement , the esws with @xmath59 will be generated one by one to reconstruct the @xmath0 state .",
    "( there is one exception in @xmath60-electron system at the stronger confinement side because of the finite size effect of this very small system . )",

    "one difference about the reconstructions is that the backward - moving esw can destabilize the spin - polarized @xmath0 state at the stronger confinement side , while the spin - polarized @xmath7 state is stable as parameter @xmath26 approaches zero .",
    "this difference originates from a quantitative difference , namely the electrons in spin - polarized @xmath7 state has stronger exchange effect , resulting in stronger stability of the polarized state .",

    "but when we count how many orbitals a state occupies , we neglect the orbitals with very small occupation number ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "so we say there are @xmath81 orbitals occupied in ( a ) and @xmath82 orbitals occupied in ( b).,width=302 ]    then we calculate wave functions overlaps between the destabilizing state @xmath83 at the smoother confinement side ( with pure coulomb hamiltonian ) , and the states with the @xmath84 mixed hamiltonian at the same subspace @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "as shown in table [ 5/2table2 ] , the destabilizing state @xmath83 has much larger overlap with the lowest state than any other states with mixed hamiltonian .",
    "this indicates that as @xmath75 is tuned from @xmath87 to @xmath76 , the destabilizing state adiabatically evolves to the lowest state with the @xmath84 mixed hamiltonian , and there is no energy level crossing in this process . from this",
    "we conclude that this destabilizing state is an edge state , and the instability at the smoother side of the confining potential is an edge instability .",
    "earlier work@xcite found that the spectrum of the ( neutral ) emf mode is very close to being linear , while the ( charged ) bosonic emp mode deviates from linear dispersion and bends _ downward _ as momentum increases ; we thus expect this destabilizing state to be an emp mode .",
    "this expectation is further supported by the following observation . for systems with particle number from @xmath88 to @xmath78 ( even numbers ) , the lowest state in subspace @xmath85 occupies @xmath6 or @xmath8 more orbitals than the pfaffian state ( as shown in fig .",

    "the emf wave functions constructed in ref .",
    "tell us in subspaces @xmath89 emf excitations at least occupy @xmath90 more orbitals than the pfaffian state ; while the emp excitations allow the electrons to occupy less orbitals .",
    "therefore , the destabilizing state with pure coulomb hamiltonian which adiabatically evolves into the lowest state with mixed hamiltonian , is also an emp of the pure coulomb hamiltonian . by the calculation and argument above",
    ", we conclude that the state destabilizing pfaffian state at the smoother confinement side is a pfaffian state s emp excitation ( instead of esw as the abelian fqh states or emf ) .",
    "since the critical parameter @xmath91 of this edge reconstruction has no big change as the particle number increases from @xmath88 to @xmath78 as shown in table [ 5/2table ] , we predict that @xmath91 is between @xmath76 and @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the finite zeeman coupling will further support polarized edge excitations to reconstruct the pfaffian state with changing confinement .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the low - energy excitations and edge reconstructions of fqh liquids with spin degrees of freedom . for the abelian fqh liquids at the filling factors",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we find that spin plays a prominent role in edge instabilities , at least when the zeeman splitting of @xmath19 factor is tuned to be sufficiently small .",
    "these results are also relevant to systems with other internal degrees of freedom ( often referred to as pseudospins ) , including systems with valley degeneracy like graphene or si , and multi - layered systems .    on the other hand , for non - abelian moore - read pfaffian state that may describe the fqh state at @xmath10 , we find that spin plays no role in its instability in finite size systems .",
    "our results thus suggest that if the moore - read pfaffian state is realized at @xmath10 , it is likely to be spin - polarized not only in the bulk,@xcite but also at the edge .",
    "furthermore we clarified that its instability is triggered by softening of edge magnetoplasmon excitation on the smoother side of the confining potential , while on the sharp side it results from competition with other bulk states , in agreement with earlier study.@xcite we need to caution though within the way we model the 5/2 fqh liquid , we have not been able to access the anti - pfaffian state , which has a more complicated edge structure .",
    "we can not say anything about the role spin plays there , should that state be the one actually realized experimentally .",
    "we conclude by stating that building upon earlier theoretical and numerical works , we have shown spins ( and possibly other internal degrees of freedom ) play an active role at the edge of many fqh liquids , including triggering their instabilities .",
