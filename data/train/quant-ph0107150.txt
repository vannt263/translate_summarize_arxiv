    "intermolecular energy transfer as a fundamental process in many biochemical and solid - state systems has been of increasing interest @xcite .",
    "it is often distinguished between two cases , namely ( radiationless ) short - range transfer ( also called frster transfer @xcite ) and ( radiative ) long - range transfer . in the former the distance @xmath2 between donor and acceptor",
    "is small compared with the electronic energy transfer wavelength @xmath3 , .",
    "the free - space transfer rate behaves as @xmath0 , which can be explained by the instantaneous ( longitudinal ) coulomb interaction between the two molecules . in the latter",
    "the intermolecular distance substantially exceeds the transition wavelength , .",
    "the observed @xmath1 dependence of the transfer rate can be regarded as being the result of emission and reabsorption of real ( transverse ) photons .",
    "it is worth noting that in a rigorous approach to the problem ( e.g. , within the framework of the multipolar formalism of qed @xcite ) the @xmath0 and @xmath1 distance dependences are limiting cases of a unified theory @xcite .",
    "when the two molecules are near material bodies , then the electromagnetic field felt by them can be quite different from that in free space and the intermolecular energy transfer can change accordingly .",
    "the effect has attracted attention , because it offers the possibility of controlling the energy transfer , with regard to potential applications , e.g. , in high - efficiency light - harvesting systems , optical networks , and quantum computing .",
    "enhanced energy transfer between molecules randomly distributed within a single glycerol droplet ( of about 10@xmath4 m diameter ) @xcite and within a polymer fabry - prot microcavity @xcite has been observed .",
    "using monomolecular layers of donor and acceptor molecules ( separated by distances of @xmath5 nm ) in planar microstructures , the dependence of short - range energy transfer on the local photon mode density has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "calculations of the energy transfer rate have been performed in order to include the effect of bulk material @xcite , microspheres @xcite , and planar microcavities @xcite . the quantum theory given in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a microscopic model that allows for both dispersing and absorbing bulk material . in refs .",
    "@xcite the classical field generated by a donor dipole and felt by an acceptor dipole in the presence of a microsphere is substituted into the free - space fermi s golden rule expression .",
    "a strictly quantum mechanical treatment that starts from a mode decomposition of the electromagnetic field according to the helmholtz equation of the macroscopic maxwell equations is given in refs .",
    "unfortunately , the microscopic theory developed for bulk material @xcite becomes quite cumbersome when boundaries are present , and studies based on the standard mode expansion @xcite can not incorporate material absorption .    in the present paper",
    "we give a rigorous derivation of the rate of intermolecular energy transfer in the presence of arbitrarily shaped , dispersing , and absorbing material bodies , starting from the quantized version of the macroscopic electromagnetic field .",
    "the quantization is based on the introduction of langevin noise current and charge densities into the classical maxwell equations , which can then be transferred to quantum theory , with the electromagnetic - field operators being expressed in terms of a continuous set of fundamental bosonic fields via the classical green tensor ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , we show that the minimal - coupling scheme and the multipolar - coupling scheme yield exactly the same form of the rate formula .",
    "it is worth noting that the formalism includes material absorption and dispersion in a consistent way , without restriction to a particular frequency domain , and applies to an arbitrary ( inhomogeneous ) medium configuration .    here",
    ", we apply the theory to bulk material , multi - slab planar structures , and microspheres , with special emphasis on media of drude  lorentz type .",
    "in particular , we show that the energy transfer can be strongly modified , if the two molecules are sufficiently near an interface and surface - guided waves at the energy transfer wavelength exist .",
    "four- and five - layered planar structures are studied , and the results are compared with recent measurements @xcite . finally , the effect of surface - guided waves and whispering - gallery waves in the case of the molecules being near a microsphere is briefly discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ rate ] the basic - theoretical concept of electromagnetic - field quantization",
    "is outlined and the energy transfer rate is derived .",
    "section  [ disc ] is devoted to applications , with special emphasis on multi - slab planar structures , and concluding remarks are made in section  [ conl ] .",
