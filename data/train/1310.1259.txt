    "compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite has recently emerged as an efficient technique for sampling a signal with fewer coefficients than the number dictated by classical shannon / nyquist theory .",
    "the assumption underlying this approach is that the signal to be sampled is sparse or at least `` compressible '' , i.e. , it must have a concise representation in a convenient basis . in cs ,",
    "sampling is performed by taking a number of linear projections of the signal onto pseudorandom sequences .",
    "therefore , the acquisition presents appealing properties such as low encoding complexity , since the basis in which the signal is sparse does not need to be computed , and universality , since the sensing is blind to the source distribution .",
    "reconstruction of a signal from its projections can be done e.g. using linear programming @xcite , with a complexity that is @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the number of samples to be recovered .",
    "recently , cs has been applied to multi - dimensional signals . in this case",
    ", a serious problem arises regarding the computational complexity of the reconstruction process .",
    "the conventional approach of measuring the signal along all dimentions at once leads to very large @xmath1 , making the reconstruction computationally intractable .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed a way to recast a multidimensional cs problem to a one - dimensional one , by the means of kronecker products of sensing and sparsity matrices .",
    "reconstruction algorithms for multidimensional signals have also been proposed in @xcite for hyperspectral images and multiview video .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the application of cs to devices that acquire 2d visual information through progressive scanning .",
    "these devices are equipped with a one - dimensional array of detectors , and a 2d image is obtained via the repeated use of the array over different slices of the 2d object to be imaged .",
    "this is a very important scenario , which encompasses many applications . amongst others ,",
    "it is worth mentioning at least two examples , which we will focus on in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the first is given by _",
    "flatbed scanners _",
    ", where each line of the image is acquired by a 1d optical sensor moving in the orthogonal direction . the second one is represented by _ airborne and spaceborne imagers _ of the pushbroom type for remote sensing applications . in this case",
    ", the 1d sensor is carried on a flying platform such as an airplane or satellite ; the sensor looks down at the earth , and acquires a line - by - line scan of the underlying scene , while each line is oriented in the across - track direction , and the platform flight moves the sensor from one line to the next one .",
    "these applications , as well as several other ones , can clearly benefit from cs .",
    "cs - based imaging systems have been demonstrated in @xcite , where the optical sensor is replaced by an array of micromirrors that acquire linear projections of the signal samples via a single detector ( _ single - pixel camera _ ) .",
    "a similar principle can be applied to progressive scanning , where a 1d micromirror array can be used to directly sense lines in the cs format . in the case of the remote sensing imaging system",
    ", cs can lead to a simpler and cheaper system , which uses a single detector and produces a reduced number of sampling .",
    "detectors can be costly in the wavelengths outside the visible spectrum , and the reduced number of samples allows to implement simpler onboard processing systems . for the flatbed scanner ,",
    "cs would be extremely useful in order to develop a scanner of small size , as the cs sensor needs not be of the same physical size as the document being scanned .",
    "moreover , in both cases , processing and data handling would be greatly reduced , which is important in order to reduce power consumption in the remote sensing case , and in order to enable application to small - sized low - power devices in the flatbed scanner case .    in this paper",
    "we address this scenario , and tackle the reconstruction problem for 2d images acquired line - by - line . in particular , we propose a simple progressive acquisition algorithm for 2d signals , where rows are acquired independently of each other , but the reconstruction is performed jointly over all rows .",
    "joint reconstruction is achieved through an iterative algorithm that correlates different rows through linear prediction , instead of taking a multidimensional transform as sparsity domain .",
    "prediction allows to exploit correlation in both horizontal and vertical dimensions , even if the acquisition is performed in one direction only .",
    "the main concept is to exploit correlation along the vertical direction by iteratively predicting each line and reconstructing the prediction error only , which is sparser than the line itself .",
    "results show that few iterations of the proposed algorithm suffice to significantly improve the mse of the reconstruction , allowing to obtain high - quality reconstruction results with feasible complexity .",
    "we denote ( column- ) vectors and matrices by lowercase and uppercase boldface characters , respectively . the @xmath2-th element of a matrix @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5-th row of matrix @xmath3 is @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath23 can be recovered by a smaller vector @xmath24 , @xmath25 , of linear measurements @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the _ sensing matrix_. the optimum solution , requiring at least @xmath28 measurements , would be @xmath29 since the @xmath30 norm minimization is a np - hard problem , one can resort to a linear programming reconstruction by minimizing the @xmath15 norm @xmath31 provided that @xmath32 is large enough ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the same algorithm holds for signals which are not exactly sparse , but rather compressible , meaning that they ( or their representation @xmath34 in basis @xmath35 ) can be expressed only by @xmath36 significant coefficients , while the remaining ones are ( close to ) zero .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that extracting the elements of @xmath37  at random from a gaussian or rademacher distribution ( i.e. , @xmath38 with the same probability ) , and , in general , from any sub - gaussian distribution , allows a correct reconstruction with overwhelming probability .",
    "according to typical progressive scanning approaches , like the ones used by commercial flatbed scanners or by remote sensing systems acquiring environmental pictures , an image is acquired by sensing @xmath39 pixels of each row in a progressive fashion , until @xmath40 rows are acquired .",
    "hence , the acquired image will result as a matrix of pixels of size @xmath41 , which will be compressed ( and , accordingly , decoded ) using a conventional technique .",
    "this process requires the acquisition ( and processing ) of @xmath42 pixels .",
    "when @xmath40 and @xmath39 are large , processing of this huge amount of data may represent an issue , especially when dealing with low cost or low complexity devices .",
    "for this reason , we propose a very simple acquisition scheme , based on cs linear measurements taken on each row , without any further processing .",
    "this reduces the amount of data to be acquired and processed .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm relies on linear predictors in order to improve the quality of cs reconstruction , by correlating the measurements of adjacent rows in order to exploit their statistical dependencies during the reconstruction stage , largely improving over individual separate reconstruction .",
    "the stronger the correlation of pixels within a row and among rows , the better will be the performance of cs reconstruction and of the linear predictor ( and hence of the whole reconstruction algorithm ) .",
    "the image acquisition algorithm we propose , labelled as algorithm  [ alg : coding ] , is very simple and consists in taking linear measurements of each row of the image in a progressive fashion . to minimize the risks of failures in the reconstruction side , a different sensing matrix @xmath37",
    "is drawn for each row .    the image to be measured",
    "can be divided into @xmath40 rows . for each row ,",
    "@xmath32 linear measurements are taken , where @xmath43 and @xmath39 is the desired vertical resolution . in summary",
    ", the scene we wish to acquire is represented by the matrix @xmath44 . for each row of @xmath45",
    ", we draw a matrix @xmath46 whose elements are gaussian i.i.d",
    ". such that @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . then , we take @xmath32 linear measurements of @xmath50 which will form the rows of the matrix of measurements @xmath51 , namely @xmath52    the image @xmath45 , @xmath32 the measurement matrix @xmath53 draw @xmath54 s.t .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath55 @xmath53    a more complex algorithm , based on compressed sensing and able to capture spatial correlation in both directions ( horizontal and vertical ) , could acquire in a single shot the whole image in a single measurement vector of length @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 even if this algorithm performed better than the one proposed here since the reconstruction would optimally exploit the correlation in 2 dimensions through a 2d transform matrix , it would require the solution of for a vector of length @xmath61 .",
    "for realistic values of @xmath40 and @xmath39 , the solution of would be impossible to perform in reasonable time .",
    "on the other hand , the proposed approach splits the problem into smaller ( and hence tractable ) subproblems .",
    "however , in doing so , it does not neglect the spatial correlation in vertical direction , which is modeled and employed in the reconstruction process through the use of linear predictors .      a trivial reconstruction algorithm based on the acquisition scheme described in section [ sec : coding ]",
    "would simply apply the @xmath15 reconstruction to recover separately each line of @xmath45  given the corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath62 .",
    "instead , we propose an algorithm using this trivial reconstruction as the initialization step and iteratively improves the current estimate of @xmath45  by modelling statistical dependencies between adjacent lines .",
    "we label this algorithm  [ alg : decoding ] .",
    "we count the iterations using the index @xmath7 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath45  at iteration @xmath7 is denoted with @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , the algorithm evaluates a first image reconstruction performing line - by - line separate reconstruction ( iteration @xmath64 ) .",
    "then , the iterations start .",
    "the intuition is as follows . for each row",
    ", if we are able to reliably predict it using the reconstruction of the upper and lower lines at previous iteration with some linear predictor @xmath65 , obtaining @xmath66 , we can compute the `` measurement '' @xmath67 of this prediction by applying matrix @xmath54 to @xmath66 .",
    "then we calculate the prediction error in the linear measurement domain @xmath68 by subtracting this `` predicted measurement '' from the original measurement row @xmath62 .",

    "adding @xmath69 to @xmath66 provides a new estimate of @xmath70 .",
    "since the new estimate is more accurate than the old one , the process can be repeated by estimating a new , more accurate predictor .",
