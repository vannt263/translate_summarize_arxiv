    "astronomers have long used high resolution spectroscopy to examine the chemical abundances of stars in the milky way . besides meteoritic sampling , these studies provide the most accurate assessment of absolute and relative nucleosynthetic yields in our galaxy . in turn , the results test existing theories of nucleosynthesis as well as inspire new processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a principal goal of modern efforts is to extend these studies to the most extreme metal - poor stars whose enrichment might arise from a few or even a single supernova .",
    "similar chemical abundance studies have been pursued within the galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "spurred by lyman spitzer s inspiration , uv spectroscopy acquired from space telescopes has led to a detailed examination of the chemical and physical properties of this gas .",
    "many of the same elements studied in stars are analyzed in the ism , but in contrast , the ism abundance patterns reflect more on processes of dust formation and destruction than nucleosynthesis ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the advent of 10 m class telescopes , scientists now perform ism observations of high @xmath12 galaxies in a manner analogous to studies of the milky way ism ,",
    "i.e. , through an analysis of high resolution spectroscopy of distant quasars whose sightlines penetrate protogalaxies ( e.g.  wolfe et al .  1994 ; prochaska & wolfe 1996 , hereafter pw96 ; lu et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter l96 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 , hereafter pw99 ; pettini et al .",
    "2000 ) . the majority of these quasar absorption line ( qal ) studies have focused on the chemical abundances of the damped ly@xmath0 systems : neutral hydrogen gas layers with hi column density , @xmath13 .",
    "these qal systems are the dominant reservoir of neutral baryons at every observable epoch and are routinely identified as the progenitors of modern galaxies . indeed , this was the founding principle of the first damped ly@xmath0 surveys @xcite and is well supported by the correspondence of the inferred baryonic mass density of damped systems at @xmath14 and the mass density in stars today @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting aspects of the damped ly@xmath0 systems is the fact that they provide a means for assessing the chemical abundances of many elements for galactic systems in the early stages of evolution .",
    "high resolution studies of metal - poor stars may offer a complementary view , but at present these studies are limited to the milky way and a few other nearby systems .",
    "therefore , interpretations associated with metal - poor stars are strictly limited by the fact that one is not sensitive _ a priori _ to a wide range of star formation histories ; there is always the possibility that the milky way represents a unique path in the nucleosynthetic history of the universe .",
    "in contrast , the damped ly@xmath0 systems presumably probe protogalaxies with a range of characteristics ( e.g.  mass , morphology , age ) . at some level , this diversity is a hindrance because our very limited knowledge of these properties .",
    "nevertheless , the damped ly@xmath0 systems provide a valuable laboratory for research on stellar nucleosynthesis .    because the damped ly@xmath0 systems exhibit sub - solar metallicities , including several with [ fe / h ]  @xmath15 , one expects their observed abundance patterns to arise from a non - solar nucleosynthetic pattern modified by the depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains .",
    "ideally , one aims to disentangle the two patterns in order to gauge the implications of dust depletion ( e.g.  obscuration bias ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and reveal the chemical enrichment history of these first galaxies . unfortunately , the analysis is confused by the limited number of routinely observed elements ( fe , si , cr , ni , al , zn ) and the coincidence between a standard type  ii sn pattern and the warm halo ism dust depletion pattern ( l96 ; pw99 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter p00 ) .",
    "the challenge is to identify abundance ratios which lift this degeneracy . in this paper",
    "we analyze recently published chemical abundances of a large database of @xmath16 damped ly@xmath0 systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "all of the data were obtained with the hires spectrograph @xcite on the keck  i telescope , were reduced with the makee software package , and analyzed with the same techniques ( see paper  i for complete details ) .",
    "it is a large homogeneous dataset , ideal for comprehensive analysis . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to five main areas : ( @xmath17  [ sec : elem ] ) an element by element discussion of abundance trends with fe metallicity ; ( @xmath17  [ sec : dust - depl ] ) an investigation of dust depletion ; ( @xmath17  [ sec : nucleo ] ) implications for nucleosynthesis in these protogalaxies ; ( @xmath17  [ sec : dust - obsc ] ) evidence for / against dust obscuration ; and ( @xmath17  [ sec : chemev ] ) the chemical enrichment history inferred from damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "we conclude ( @xmath17  [ sec : discuss ] ) with a general discussion of the damped ly@xmath0 systems including speculations on their physical nature . given the length of this manuscript",
    ", we encourage the reader to focus on areas of primary interest and refer to the summary tables throughout .",
    "in this section we present the most important elemental abundances for our sample of damped ly@xmath0 systems , stressing the new results from this paper . throughout the analysis we adopt no ionization corrections , i.e.",
    ", we assume that the column density of element x is equal to the column density of the dominant ionization state in neutral hydrogen gas : fe@xmath18 for fe , o@xmath19 for o , h@xmath19 for h. this assumption is theoretically motivated ( e.g. pw96 ; viegas 1994 ) , but not well established empirically .",
    "recent calculations indicate ionization corrections should be small for the majority of elements considered here @xcite , but future damped ly@xmath0 studies need to address this point unambiguously @xcite .    following standard practice in stellar abundance studies",
    ", we plot the abundance of each element with respect to fe relative to the solar ratio , [ x / fe ]  @xmath20 - \\log [ { { n({\\rm x})}}/{{n({\\rm fe})}}]_\\odot$ ] , against [ fe / h ] . in a stellar analysis",
    ", this comparison highlights trends which reflect nucleosynthetic processes convolved with the star formation history . for the damped ly@xmath0 systems , the analysis is sensitive to the combined effects of nucleosynthesis and dust depletion .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we plot @xmath21 error bars derived from the apparent optical depth method ( aodm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as listed in paper  i. for each element , we consider several simple statistics ( e.g.  a pearson s test to investigate linear correlations ) of the observed sample excluding all upper and lower limits .",
    "a summary of this section is given in tables  [ tab : sumelm ] and [ tab : absum ] ( @xmath17  [ sec : absum ] ) .",
    "we begin with the elements whose atomic numbers are near fe , the so - called fe - peak elements .",
    "we include zn , although it is not a true fe - peak element and is probably produced through different nucleosynthetic processes @xcite .",
    "almost all of our interpretations of dust depletion , dust obscuration , and nucleosynthesis are drawn in part from fe measurements and , therefore , it is important to highlight the uncertainties associated with measuring @xmath22 .",
    "the most significant uncertainties at the time of this publication are in the oscillator strengths of the fe  ii @xmath231608,1611 transitions . for fe  ii 1608 ,",
    "the @xmath24-value is taken from @xcite who attribute a @xmath25 error to their laboratory value which translates to @xmath26  dex uncertainty . for fe  ii 1611",
    ", we consider the most reliable value to be the theoretical value from @xcite . until now , most damped ly@xmath0 analyses have relied upon the @xmath27 value presented by @xcite from their empirical analysis of several fe  ii transitions observed in the ism .",
    "the difference is significant ; the @xcite @xmath24-value implies an @xmath28  dex lower @xmath29 value than the @xcite value .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the @xmath29 value derived from fe  ii 1611 is in good agreement with the values from fe  ii 2249 and 2260 in the systems where we observed all three profiles .",
    "therefore , we are reasonably confident in the adopted fe  ii 1611 oscillator strength .    for some of the following analysis , we adopt a proxy for fe ( e.g. cr , ni , al ) when we have no reliable @xmath29 measurement . in these cases ,",
    "we assume [ fe / h ] = [ ni / h ]  @xmath30 , [ fe / h ] = [ cr / h ]  @xmath31 , or [ fe / h ] = [ al / h ] for reasons which will become obvious below .",
    "when we have made this substitution , we plot these specific data points with a unique symbol and generally do not include their values in any statistical analysis ( i.e. means , medians , pearsons tests ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : crfe ] presents the [ cr / fe ] values vs.  [ fe / h ] for our complete sample .",
    "nearly every damped system shows an enhanced cr / fe ratio , a behavior first noted in l96 and emphasized in pw99 .",
    "the median enhancement is + 0.17  dex which is suggestive of dust depletion because no stellar population shows enhanced cr / fe whereas dust depleted ism sightlines do exhibit a mild cr overabundance .",
    "one also notes a slight anti - correlation between [ cr / fe ] and metallicity .",
    "if the trend is not the result of small number statistics , it may have significant implications for dust depletion ( @xmath17  [ subsec : xfeznfe ] ) .",
    "@xcite recently drew attention to the prospect of measuring co in the damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "figure  [ fig : cofe ] plots the [ co / fe ] values for our full sample , with all but one measurement an upper limit on @xmath32 .",
    "we report a measurement for the system at @xmath33 toward q220619 which is consistent with the value reported by @xcite . our value is based on the very weak co  ii 1574 transition , however , and",
    "is therefore highly suspect .",
    "furthermore , the upper limits that we place on @xmath32 from co  ii 1941 and 2012 are smaller than the value for co  ii 1574 and also are in conflict with the value implied by ellison et al .",
    "it is possible that the differences are due to continuum error , although we suggest ellison et al .",
    "slightly overestimated @xmath32 .",
    "the effect of dust depletion on the co / fe ratio is not well understood , in particular because co@xmath34 has been very rarely detected in the ism . from the measurements for @xmath35  oph , it appears that co has a refractory nature similar to fe and the other fe - peak elements .",
    "this is expected given the correlation observed between the gas - phase abundance and condensation temperature of many elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , a significant departure from the solar ratio might indicate important nucleosynthetic processes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cofe ] indicates several upper limits whose value approach the solar abundance .",
    "greater attention should be given to these few systems where improved s / n can provide meaningful co measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : nife ] plots [ ni / fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] for 31  of our damped ly@xmath0 systems .",

    "the unweighted mean of all measurements ( no limits ) is @xmath36 > } \\ , = { + 0.07}\\pm 0.03 $ ] and the median value is + 0.095 .",
    "this enhancement is not observed in the ism and conflicts with empirical trends in metal - poor stars although a ni / fe enhancement is predicted in core - collapse explosions of massive pop  iii stars @xcite . of course",
    ", a small error may exist in the ni@xmath34 or fe@xmath34 atomic data implying this mild enhancement .",
    "an enhanced ni / fe ratio can also arise from photoionization @xcite , but one would also predict a large ni / cr ratio where the opposite is observed . finally , it is possible the enhanced ni / fe values reflect intrinsic differences in abundance patterns between stellar atmospheres and the damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "zinc plays a pivotal role in interpreting the abundance patterns of the damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "since @xcite demonstrated that most damped systems exhibit enhanced zn / cr ratios , the community has generally accepted the notion that the refractory elements ( e.g.  fe , ni , cr ) are mildly depleted .",
    "because of the impact of this element , it is important to carefully examine any issues which influence measurements of @xmath37 .",
    "while there are two strong zn  ii transitions at 2026and 2062 , the latter transition is often blended with the cr  ii 2062 transition .",
    "therefore we rely primarily on the zn  ii 2026 profile , in particular because the aodm does not easily account for line blending .",
    "the difficulty , however , is that the zn  ii 2026 profile may also be blended with two other transitions : mg  i 2026 and cr  ii 2026 with separations from zn  ii 2026 of + 52  km / s and + 20  km / s respectively .",
    "luckily , the oscillator strength of the cr  ii 2026 transition is small enough that it should not significantly affect the @xmath37 measurement .",
    "the mg  i 2026 profile , meanwhile , has been considered in previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but was generally ignored in pw99 .",
    "the difficulty with this transition is that mg@xmath19 is not the dominant ionization state of mg in a neutral hydrogen gas region ; it has an ionization potential ip  @xmath38  ev .",
    "therefore , the population of this ionization state is sensitive to a variety of physical conditions all of which are largely unconstrained by our observations .",
    "while another strong mg  i transition does exist at 2796 , our observations never cover this profile . in short ,",
    "those systems which have absorption profiles spanning over 50  km / s should be considered to have @xmath37 values with upper limits until mg@xmath19 is carefully considered .",
    "an excellent example of this issue is presented by the damped system at @xmath39 toward q1331 + 17 ( paper  i , @xmath17  3.20 ) .",
    "@xcite noted a significant feature in the zn  ii 2026 profile which coincides with the mg  i 2026 transition and corrected @xmath37 accordingly . at higher resolution",
    ", however , we find that this absorption also coincides with a significant feature in the fe  ii profiles meaning it could be another component in the zn  ii profile , not mg  i. even more confusing is the fact that the @xmath37 values for zn  ii 2026 and 2062 agreed very well in our initial analysis ( pw99 ) . after performing a line - profile fitting analysis of all of the cr  ii and zn  ii profiles , however , we derived an @xmath37 value @xmath40  dex lower than our previous analysis and a much lower @xmath41 value than that inferred by pettini et al . in this case , therefore , correcting for mg@xmath19 suggests a significant underestimate of zn@xmath34 in the moderate resolution analysis but implies our initial echelle analysis provided a small overestimate to @xmath37 .",

    "a comparison of the profiles provides convincing evidence that the feature at @xmath42 in the zn  ii 2026 profile is not zn@xmath34 absorption but is due to mg  i 2026 . similar blending",
    "must be considered when measuring @xmath37 from the zn  ii 2026 transition .",

    "it is clear that the strong component at @xmath45  km / s in the mg  i profile must be attributed to mg@xmath19 and not zn@xmath34 .",

    "in contrast to the si / fe ratios , the si / ni ratios are reasonably constant over the entire range of metallicity . furthermore , the systems with the highest two [ si / h ] values actually exhibit two of the _ lowest _ [ si / ni ] values . the difference in the behavior of ni and fe is difficult to understand , particularly because dust depletion should imply even larger si / ni ratios .",
    "although photoionization would tend to predict enhanced ni / fe ratios together with higher si / fe abundance , the low ni / cr ratios contradict this explanation @xcite .",

    "future s measurements of the significantly depleted damped systems ( i.e. [ si / fe ]  @xmath143 ) will allow for an investigation into the formation of silicates in the damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "for the same reasons it is difficult to identify abundance ratios which establish or rule out the presence of dust depletion in the damped ly@xmath0 systems , it is also challenging to reveal the underlying nucleosynthetic patterns .",
    "not surprisingly , previous authors have offered competing viewpoints .",
    "l96 argued that the enhanced si / fe and s / fe ratios and the sub - solar mn / fe ratios provide compelling evidence for type  ii sn enrichment . at the time , they explained the enhanced zn / fe ratios in terms of nucleosynthetic enrichment which  at least in part  has been borne out by recent theoretical and empirical studies .",
    "in contrast , other authors have noted that if one corrects for dust depletion under the assumption that zn / fe is an accurate assessment of depletion , then the underlying nucleosynthetic pattern is more suggestive of solar abundances , i.e. , enrichment dominated by type  ia sn @xcite .",
    "as we discussed in pw99 and p00 , the two viewpoints are difficult to reconcile , particularly because one observes enhanced zn / fe ratios in metal - poor stars . until there is a major breakthrough in our understanding of dust depletion in the damped systems ,",
    "the most fruitful approach is to consider abundance ratios which break the dust / nucleosynthesis degeneracy and/or damped systems where the abundance ratios suggest negligible dust depletion ( pettini et al .",
    "1999 ; pw99 ; molaro et al .",
    "we adopt this method in the following subsections , stressing several abundance patterns which reflect on nucleosynthesis largely independent of dust depletion .",

    "these trends imply the metal - poor damped ly@xmath0 systems are primarily enriched by type  ii sn .",
    "a type  ii sn enrichment interpretation is further supported by the s / si ratios . because sulfur is non - refractory",
    ", one can use the difference in the refractory nature of s and si to gauge the level of si depletion , i.e. , by searching for systematically large s / si ratios .",
    "the absence of such a signature in figure  [ fig : xysi]f argues that systems with low [ si / h ] have no silicate dust grains and presumably are essentially dust - free .",
    "this further supports our contention that the si / fe enhancements in these systems result from nucleosynthesis and not dust depletion .",
    "l96 and @xcite have stressed that mn / fe and ti / fe ratios can provide insight into the debate on type  ii and type  ia nucleosynthesis independent of dust depletion , but recent developments appear to limit the impact of these elements .",

    "second our additional ti measurements and the revised ti  ii 1910 oscillator strengths indicate the majority of damped systems have solar or sub - solar ti / fe values . in these cases , it is difficult to comment on nucleosynthesis because the low ti / fe ratios are likely the result of dust depletion ( e.g. figure  [ fig : siti ] ) .",
    "hopefully , the next generation of echelle spectrographs with higher uv sensitivity will yield a number of ar measurements and more meaningful lower limits on @xmath53 .",

    "for example , previous authors have simply assumed zn / fe is intrinsically solar and constrained their dust correction analysis accordingly . because there may be a nucleosynthetic contribution to zn / fe , this implies an overestimate to these dust corrections .",
    "although it is not very constructive , instead of presenting our own analysis we offer some criticism on treatments in the literature .",
    "the most comprehensive approach to dust corrections in the damped ly@xmath0 systems was presented by @xcite . in his prescription , vladilo assumed that dust in the damped ly@xmath0 systems has the same average number of atoms of each element per grain as galactic dust . if , for example , galactic dust has two mn atoms depleted for every 10 fe atoms , then this ratio applies for the damped ly@xmath0 systems _ irrespective of the total number of mn and fe atoms present_. in other words , the dust grain composition ( e.g. silicates , oxides ) is independent of the relative quantities of the elements present during grain formation .",
    "physically , one expects the two - body process of adhesion of an element onto dust grains to be proportional to the product of the densities of that element and the dust grains .",
    "if there are fewer atoms available ( i.e. due to a nucleosynthetic underabundance ) , then the adhesion rate will be correspondingly lower . aside from this assumption being non - physical",

    "this presumably reflects the lower metallicity of the damped ly@xmath0 systems but may also correspond to lower density gas or physical processes which destroy dust grains  @xmath255 and [ zn / fe ]  @xmath256 is nearly negligible ( equation  [ eqn : kappazn ] ) . ] .",
    "the depletion levels implied by zn / fe or si / fe do not correlate with @xmath9 or @xmath48 but only with metallicity at [ si / h ]  @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , over @xmath257 of the systems exhibit [ si / fe ]  @xmath258  dex which we interpret as a floor imposed by nucleosynthesis . finally , there is uniformity to the dust depletion levels within each damped system ( pw96 ) .",
    "with very few exceptions ( notably the systems toward q034738 and q1759 + 75 ) , the si@xmath34 profiles follow the fe@xmath34 profiles which track the zn@xmath34 profiles . on a velocity component by component basis , therefore , the depletion levels are constant throughout each system . as we argued in pw96 , density fluctuations or regions shocked by supernovae ought to imply variations in the depletion levels . instead",
    ", the damped ly@xmath0 systems tend to only show differences from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "because dust depletion modifies the gas - phase abundances of the damped ly@xmath0 systems , it complicates attempts to identify the underlying nucleosynthetic patterns .",
    "presently , we feel dust corrections can not be applied to the observed abundance ratios in a quantitative fashion .",
    "there are too many uncertainties associated with the composition of the dust grains , the processes of grain formation , and even identifying the base level of depletion . regarding the latter point ,",
    "previous authors have simply assumed the observed zn / fe enhancements are entirely the product of dust depletion , a presumption likely to be incorrect . until significant advances are made in our understanding of the processes of dust depletion , introducing dust corrections",
    "will have limited value .",
    "nevertheless , because the relative abundances show little variation with metallicity or any other property and the ratios with the largest dispersion ( zn / fe , si / fe ) are the most affected by dust depletion , this implies the nucleosynthetic patterns are very uniform . to assess the likelihood of nucleosynthetic variations , one can examine the si / fe ratios where offsets from the solar ratio could be expected from both nucleosynthesis and dust depletion ( and even photoionization ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sife ] indicates the observed scatter in [ si / fe ] is small : @xmath259[si / fe ] ) = 0.14  dex . because it is unlikely that dust depletion reduces the intrinsic scatter , the nucleosynthetic variation in si / fe from system to system is probably even smaller than the observed dispersion .",
    "this point is emphasized by the behavior of [ si / fe ] at [ si / h ]  @xmath154  dex ( figure  [ fig : xysi]a ) . at these metallicities ,",
    "essentially every system exhibits [ si / fe ]  @xmath7 ; the dispersion is less than 0.08  dex and is consistent with measurement error .",
    "the [ si / fe ] ratios indicate a very uniform enrichment history for the damped ly@xmath0 systems , i.e. , proportionally similar enrichment from type  ia and type  ii sn . allowing for the effects of dust depletion at [ si / h ]  @xmath3",
    ", this uniform enrichment history holds from [ si / h ]  @xmath260 , a stunning range in metallicity .",
    "furthermore , the odd - even effect , as probed by si / al , also shows no significant variation from system to system . allowing for mild depletion in the damped ly@xmath0 systems , then , the nucleosynthetic patterns of the damped ly@xmath0 systems are essentially constant with metallicity , redshift , and @xmath9 .",
    "the principal result of our examination of dust obscuration is that the majority of damped ly@xmath0 systems have very similar extinction properties ; all but one system has an estimated extinction correction @xmath185  mag .",
    "although this one outlier demonstrates that systems with significant extinction exist , the majority of the observed sample  and by inference we contend the majority of all damped ly@xmath0 systems  have minimal extinction .",
    "this implies that systems hidden from the damped ly@xmath0 surveys have similar characteristics to our observed sample , i.e. , the observed uniformity in chemical abundances is not the result of dust obscuration .",
    "finally , we stress that the mean metallicity of the damped ly@xmath0 systems exhibits a temporal constancy .",
    "both the unweighted and @xmath9-weighted mean metallicities demonstrate only mild evolution from @xmath261 , an epoch spanning @xmath262  gyr where significant star formation is known to occur @xcite .",
    "there appears to be a marked decline at @xmath10 , but by only the factor of a few .",
    "there may also be a decline in the dispersion of [ fe / h ] values with increasing redshift , but this difference is also small . with the possible exception of the very highest redshift systems , therefore ,",
    "the damped ly@xmath0 systems have an unevolving chemical enrichment history .",
    "the uniformity of the chemical abundances of the damped ly@xmath0 systems has profound implications for their enrichment history .",
    "it must be emphasized that the damped ly@xmath0 systems are _ selected in absorption only according to their hi column density_. with the exception of dust obscuration  an issue we feel increasingly confident has minimal impact at high @xmath12  this selection criterion is unbiased . in turn , one expects the damped ly@xmath0 systems to correspond to the bulk of the protogalactic population , i.e. , galaxies with a large range of mass , age , morphology , and chemical enrichment history .",
    "the actual distribution of protogalaxies is determined by the product of their number density and hi cross - sectional area ( i.e. their optical depth , @xmath263 ) .",
    "the observed chemical abundances , meanwhile , not only depend on the base properties of the galaxies , but also on gradients and variations within each galaxy .",
    "for example , sightlines will preferentially pass through the outer regions of galaxies with high central hi surface density simply because the available cross - section increases radially as @xmath264 but are restricted to the inner regions of systems with low central hi surface density .",
    "therefore , one has every reason to expect large variations in the chemical abundances of the damped ly@xmath0 systems from system to system and within a given system .    in terms of the total metallicity of individual",
    "damped ly@xmath0 systems , a significant dispersion is observed ( e.g. figure  [ fig : chemfe ] ) .",
    "it is most pronounced at @xmath265 which probably reflects protogalaxies with a greater range of mass and age than at @xmath266 .",
    "it is also more pronounced for sightlines with @xmath267 which might indicate metallicity gradients within a given system . in terms of the relative abundances ,",
    "however , the absence of significant variation is striking . at most , there are differences of @xmath268  dex and these are almost entirely the product of dust depletion .",
    "this uniformity raises the following questions : granted the dispersion in [ fe / h ] and @xmath9 values , why are the chemical abundance patterns and therefore the dust depletion and nucleosynthetic properties so similar ?",
    "furthermore , why do these properties exhibit such minimal evolution with redshift ?",
    "one possibility is that the damped ly@xmath0 systems are dominated by a subset of protogalaxies which have similar physical characteristics .",
    "perhaps they arise in galaxies with the largest hi radial extent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or in a very large number of low mass galaxies . in this scenario , the range of @xmath9 and [ fe / h ] values would result from gradients within each galaxy .",
    "the systems would have similar enrichment histories and therefore possess similar nucleosynthetic patterns .",
    "it might be difficult to explain the constant mean metallicity with redshift , but perhaps this sub - population of galaxies has a small overall star formation rate . a more dramatic scenario to explain the relative abundance uniformity is that the nucleosynthetic histories of _ all _ protogalaxies at [ fe / h ]  @xmath269 are the same .",
    "the protogalactic abundance patterns we observe are derived from the convolution of the initial mass function ( imf ) and the integrated star formation history .",
    "although the concept of a universal imf is widely supported , one might expect significant differences in the level and duration of star formation throughout the entire galactic population .",
    "in fact , it is these variations which presumably generate the differences in the observed abundances of various stellar populations . in order to explain the uniformity of the abundance patterns in this scenario , therefore",
    ", one may require a disparity between the damped ly@xmath0 and stellar abundances which we consider in the following sub - section .",
    "while the constancy of the chemical abundances from system to system has important implications for the properties of high redshift protogalaxies , the uniformity within each system ( as a function of velocity along the sightline ) may place the tightest constraints on their physical nature .",
    "as first emphasized in pw96 , the dominant ionic species ( e.g. fe@xmath34 , si@xmath34 ) show no significant variations from velocity component to component .",
    "this uniformity is not universal  the system toward gb1759 + 75 is an excellent counter - example @xcite  but holds for nearly every damped ly@xmath0 system in our sample .",
    "therefore , there is little variation both in terms of dust depletion and nucleosynthesis at the presumably kpc scales resolved by the velocity profiles .",
    "if the observed variations in @xmath9 and [ fe / h ] are at least partly due to gradients in surface density and enrichment in these protogalaxies , then there must be very little radial variation in dust depletion or nucleosynthetic enrichment . under the assumption that the absorption arises within a single protogalaxy , the observations indicate one or more of the following : ( i ) the mixing timescales are sufficiently small to yield constant relative abundances in these protogalaxies .",
    "for this to hold true , the timescale would have to be shorter than both the timescales for supernovae with significantly different yields ( e.g. @xmath270  gyr for type  ia sn ) and the timescale for dust grain formation ; ( ii ) abundance variations are washed out in velocity space because the observed velocity components are actually the superposition of many clouds , each with its own intrinsic abundances and dust depletion . of course , it could be difficult to explain why the mean abundances of each component are so similar ; ( iii ) the protogalactic volume probed by a damped ly@xmath0 observation is smaller than the scale where abundance differences are large .",
    "this scenario would require that the chemical filling - factor of protogalaxies to be very small at these epochs , an unlikely presumption .",
    "furthermore , it would be very difficult to explain the kinematic characteristics observed from the low - ion profiles @xcite .",
    "of these three possibilities , we believe efficient mixing is the most likely explanation .    on the other hand , if the damped ly@xmath0 profiles result from the superposition of absorption from several protogalaxies , then the observed uniformity places important constraints on the properties of the various clumps. the most important result from our first study on damped ly@xmath0 velocity fields @xcite is that protogalaxies as single disks within the cdm framework can not reproduce our observations .",
    "this conclusion contradicted the protogalactic paradigm of the time ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and inspired alternate protogalactic models within the cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "the key difference of the new scenarios is that the velocity profiles of the damped ly@xmath0 systems arise from the intersection with several protogalaxies . if these protogalactic clumps have formed independently , they should have unique metallicities , enrichment histories , and depletion levels .",
    "it may be very difficult to account for the chemical similarity among the low - ion profiles within this scenario .",
    "for the metal - poor systems ( i.e. [ si / h ]  @xmath4 ) , where we note little dispersion in any abundance ratio from sightline to sightline , the multiple clump scenario may not be challenged .",
    "the systems at [ si / h ]  @xmath63 , in contrast , do exhibit variations in several ratios ( e.g. si / fe and zn / cr ) from system to system and might therefore be expected to show variations along the velocity profile .",
    "we emphasize that these systems tend to have larger velocity widths @xcite , in fact these are the systems which _ require _ the multiple clump scenario within the cdm framework . at present",
    ", we can not test the multiple clump scenario against our observations because these models provide at best crude predications for the dust properties and enrichment histories of the protogalactic clumps .",
    "we suspect , however , that these observations may ultimately pose a great challenge for theories of galaxy formation within the cdm cosmology .",
    "the damped ly@xmath0 systems are the dominant neutral gas reservoirs of the universe .",
    "therefore , it is natural to identify them as the fuel for past and present star formation and compare their abundance patterns with current stellar populations .",
    "an important property of the damped ly@xmath0 systems , however , is the fact that the majority have a very small molecular fraction @xcite .",
    "if the observed gas in the damped ly@xmath0 systems does fuel star formation , then there must be an intermediate stage which inspires the growth of molecular clouds .",
    "this suggests star formation is disconnected from the ism of protogalaxies as probed by the damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "this disparity may manifest itself through contradictions in the abundance patterns of the damped ly@xmath0 systems with present - day stellar populations . for example , although we contend the damped ly@xmath0 systems exhibit @xmath0-enhancements similar to the galactic halo stars , the damped ly@xmath0 si / al ratios are substantially lower than the observed stellar values .",
    "furthermore , we have identified variations along the fe - peak which may contradict the chemical abundance patterns of every stellar population .",
    "our observations might indicate that star formation occurs independent of the gas probed by our observations .",
    "this is not a profound supposition ; star formation in the milky way is primarily restricted to dense molecular clouds whose filling factor is small . in this case",
    ", enrichment occurs independent of the global ism and can proceed on very short timescales such that the stellar by - products have unique abundance patterns .",
    "we envision a scenario of star formation where the first stars to form in a molecular cloud should have abundances similar to the ism , but star formation proceeds rapidly through several generations with the subsequent stellar populations more closely reflecting the rapidly changing abundances of the molecular cloud .",
    "although supernovae feedback will ultimately distribute the metals of the molecular cloud to the ambient ism , the effects on the mean abundances might be small",
    ". this would be particularly true if the majority of metals are carried out to the local igm instead ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in short , one can envision an ism mildly enriched by the by - products of molecular clouds , each with its own metallicity and relative chemical abundances giving mean abundances different from observed stellar populations .",
    "star formation may also have significant impact on the protogalactic population selected by damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "there are two competing processes affecting the damped ly@xmath0 cross - section of a given galaxy . as galaxies form through the accretion and dissipation of gas , their hi surface densities will increase until they have an appreciable surface density with @xmath271 . on the other hand ,",
    "star formation lowers the surface density through the consumption of gas and the feedback from supernovae .",
    "qualitatively , we expect the damped ly@xmath0 systems to more frequently probe galaxies in the early stages of formation , in particular prior to significant star formation .",
    "this might well explain the lack of chemical evolution observed in the damped systems : at every epoch the damped ly@xmath0 systems are predominantly gas - rich , metal - poor galaxies .",
    "systems which have experienced bursts of star formation ( e.g. the lyman break galaxies ) may have consumed or blown out an appreciable fraction of their hi gas and have a comparatively small damped ly@xmath0 cross - section .      in closing",
    ", we present an abundance wish list for the damped ly@xmath0 systems . achieving these goals",
    "will markedly improve our understanding of the chemical abundances of the damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "we expect most , if not all , will be accomplished in the next five years through the active efforts of our group and others throughout the community .    1 .   a comparison of the relative abundance of the @xmath0-elements ( si , s , o , ar , ti ) in several damped ly@xmath0 systems . in this paper",

    "in this section we examine the implications of the dust correction formalism introduced by @xcite .",
    "the principle premise of his treatment is that dust in the damped ly@xmath0 systems has the same average number of atoms of each element per grain as galactic dust .",
    "as we show below , this has the effect of minimizing departures from solar relative abundance for our observed abundance ratios .",
    "let us represent the number of atoms of fe in the gas and dust phases as @xmath277 and @xmath278 respectively .",
    "for a system that is 90@xmath279 depleted , this implies the dust fraction @xmath280 .",
    "now consider the abundances of an element x with a dust fraction @xmath281 .",
    "assume that in the galactic ism element x depletes relative to fe like      the prescription introduced by @xcite is to assume that this ratio applies to the damped ly@xmath0 systems _ independent of the intrinsic abundances of the system_. this has important implications for the depletion of element x relative to fe in the damped ly@xmath0 systems as inferred from their gas - phase abundances .",
    "consider the relative dust fraction of element x to fe :      the last expression demonstrates that @xmath284 if @xmath285 , i.e. if the observed gas - phase ratio of x / fe is less than the dust composition in the galactic ism .",
    "therefore , elements with low [ x / fe ] values will tend to have larger dust corrections which serve to minimize any departure of x / fe from the solar abundances .",
    "conversely , @xmath286 if the observed ratio of x / fe is greater than the dust ratio in the ism .        where @xmath289 and @xmath290 are the solar abundances of mn and fe . in the damped ly@xmath0 systems",
    ", one observes @xmath291 and therefore @xmath292 implying a higher fraction of mn is in the dust phase than fe .",
    "therefore , when one applies a dust correction to the observed mn / fe ratio , the resulting value is closer to the solar ratio of @xmath293 .",
    "a similar effect holds for a mildly refractory element like si . because the si / fe ratio observed in the damped systems is much larger than @xmath294 from the ism , the dust correction to si is much smaller than for fe and the observed si / fe is corrected downward to the solar value when dust corrections are applied .",
