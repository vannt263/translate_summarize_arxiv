    "understanding the large - scale structure of the universe and the fundamental laws governing natural phenomena have been dual goals of science since its origins in ancient greece . over the past century , remarkable progress in physics and astronomy has brought us increasingly closer to the goal , in the words of goethe s _ dr .",

    "big bang cosmology and the standard model of particle physics combine into a nearly flawless tapestry describing the evolution of our universe from the age of a few seconds to our present time . as awe inspiring as this picture is , it contains a few blurred patches and some unexplained , but highly intriguing features :    * we do not know the nature of 97% of the mass and energy content of the universe ; * we do not understand why the cosmological constant appears to be nonzero , yet many orders of magnitude smaller than dimensional arguments would suggest ; * we do not understand which principle determines the values of the more than 20 `` fundamental '' parameters in the standard model , the particle masses , mixing angles , and coupling constants ; * yet , the smallness of the cosmological constant and subtle , mysterious relationships among the fundamental constants , are essential determinants of the possibility of the emergence of life in the universe , and hence of our own existence .    the curious fact that our existence is dependent on several remarkable coincidences among the physical constants and the detailed properties of atoms and nuclei",
    "is known as the _ anthropic cosmological principle _ , or anthropic principle in short @xcite .",
    "it has a peculiar place in modern science , embraced by some leading scientists of our day and abhorred by others @xcite .",
    "most scientists believe that the fundamental laws of nature have an objective origin and are not human constructs or mere accidents . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical coincidences in the natural laws appear so contrived that they are hard to reconcile with our predilection against fine tuning .    yet",
    ", this reconciliation is not impossible .",
    "science has progressed a long way from the creation myths of ancient cultures , which explained the fecund environment on our planet as the creation of a supernatural being .",
    "we now understand that life on earth has been formed by evolutionary forces under boundary conditions , which appear to us as similarly fortuitous : the sun is a star of just the right mass to provide life sustaining energy for billions of years , long enough to support the emergence of intelligent life . the planet earth has the right size and just the right distance from the sun to retain large amounts of liquid surface water .",
    "the initial intensity of asteroidal impacts onto the earth was large enough to leave our planet with a thin crust , facilitating continuing rearrangement of the continents , and to set it into rapid rotation , leading to a moderate temperature gradient between day and night  all due to the giant impact that created the moon some 4.5 billion years ago @xcite .",
    "the impact activity then waned sufficiently , but not completely , to permit the evolution of higher forms of life by producing rare moments of large upheaval which eliminated less efficient competitors , e.g.  the dinosaurs , without destroying life in its entirety .",
    "we now know that , no matter how special these circumstances are , the universe is large enough and old enough for them to arise with reasonable likelihood on one of the planets in some solar system in some galaxy . according to rough estimates",
    ", the visible universe contains some @xmath0 stars , which means that if the combined probability for all the coincidences and fortuitous circumstances required for the emergence of intelligent and civilized life is not less than @xmath1 , then it will appear somewhere in the cosmos .",
    "this consideration also allows us to address the question whether we are `` alone '' in the universe . of the @xmath2 or so solar systems in our galaxy ,",
    "how many harbour intelligent life ?",
    "this question is answered by drake s equation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of contemporaneous civilizations in our galaxy , @xmath5 is the rate of formation or sun - like stars , @xmath6 is the probability for such a star to have an earth - like planet , @xmath7 the probability for life to form on such a planet , @xmath8 the probability for intelligent life to emerge , and @xmath9 the average lifetime of a civilization . we do not know the various components of this relation with precision , but inserting reasonable estimates and multiplying the result by the number of galaxies in the visible universe ( @xmath10 ) , we conclude that the existence of another high civilization somewhere else in the universe is quite likely .",
    "we could actually turn the argument on its head and reason that the sheer improbability of the fortunate coincidences permitting our presence on earth demands the existence of a very large number of planets with varying physical parameters and different history .",
    "this would convert the apparent improbability of our existence into likelihood and , of course , our home planet would by necessity be one that can sustain intelligent life .",
    "given the vast number of planets required to make this reasoning viable , it would be an unlikely coincidence if that number were just sufficient to produce a single case of intelligent life .",
    "hence , by means of probability arguments , we would surmise that the universe contains many planets inhabited by intelligent beings , though not necessarily all at the same time , if civilizations do not last for periods of cosmological duration .",
    "level ( from the wmap experiment ) . ]    but , if this probability argument is correct , could we expect ours to be a `` typical '' civilization ?",
    "this speculation would only be justified , if we had some idea of the parameter space defining inhabitable planets including their likelihood of formation , _ and _ would know that the earth falls into the more probable regions of this space .",
    "absent this knowledge , or some statistical information about other civilizations , there is no _ a priori _ justification of the expectation that we are typical or average on a cosmic scale . in view of the rapid progress in the search for planets orbiting other stars",
    ", we may soon be able to give a first tentative answer to this question , but we are not quite able to do so yet .",
    "we know that our universe was formed about 14 billion years ago in a state of very high temperature and has since expanded and cooled to a temperature of 2.73 k. a careful analysis of the abundance of light elements tells us that the universe has grown in size by at least 10 orders of magnitude from its early state , and probably by many more .",
    "the magnificently detailed map of the cosmic background radiation assembled by the wmap satellite ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and other experiments shows that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous on a large scale , with relative thermal fluctuations at the @xmath11 level .",
    "the data also show that the large - scale geometry of the universe is flat , or nearly flat , and that all known forms of matter constitute no more than 3% of its mass - energy content .",
    "einstein s equations of general relativity tell us that the present approximate flatness implies that the universe was flat with a precision of better than @xmath12 during the period of cosmic nucleosynthesis .",
    "following our inbred abhorrence of fine - tuning requirements , we are led to postulate that the universe is , on cosmic scales , absolutely flat .",
    "one consequence of this assumption is , in a somewhat loosely defined sense , that the positive energy of all matter in the universe , including the kinetic energy involved in the expansion , is precisely balanced by the negative energy of the attractive gravitational potential . in other words ,",
    "the total energy content of the universe is zero , or at least very small compared with its various components taken separately .",
    "this suggests that the universe may have been created by an event of microscopic dimensions , maybe some kind of quantum fluctuation .",
    "he nuclei leading to the formation of a @xmath13c nucleus . due to the instability of the @xmath14b nucleus",
    ", the reaction rate is very sensitive to the location of the compound nucleus resonance in @xmath13c . ]",
    "let us review some of the remarkable coincidences that have made life in our cosmos possible .",
    "maybe the best known example is the presence of a narrow resonance state in the excitation spectrum of @xmath13c at 7.65 mev .",
    "the location and width of this state control the fusion rate of three @xmath15he nuclei into a @xmath13c nucleus ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , and thus are determining factors of the abundance of carbon and heavier elements in the universe .",
    "the existence of this resonance is so essential , that it was predicted by hoyle @xcite in order to explain the cosmic carbon abundance .",
    "the energy of this state depends sensitively on the strength of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , as well as on the proton and neutron masses .",
    "microscopic calculations @xcite have shown that abundant production of @xmath13c in stellar fusion requires a fine - tuning of the strength of the nuclear force to the precision of @xmath16% .",
    "another salient example of apparent fine - tuning is the neutron ",
    "proton mass difference @xmath17 , which is a subtle balance of the difference between the masses of the @xmath18- and @xmath19-quarks and the electromagnetic self - energies of the proton and neutron .",
    "the mass difference @xmath20 controls both , the lifetime of the free neutron and the regions of stability against beta - decay of atomic nuclei .",
    "if the neutron were only 0.15% lighter or 0.3% heavier , the stablity and cosmic abundance of nuclei important for life would be seriously affected .",
    "there is a delicate balance between the rate of energy production in the interior of stars ( governed by the density and temperature of the stellar core ) , the rate of energy transport to the surface ( determined by the stellar radius and the temperature profile ) , and rate of energy radiation from the surface ( governed by the surface temperature ) . the existence of stable , very long - lived stars with significant energy output , like our sun , relies on the near coincidence of two very large dimensionless quantities @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath23 the electromagnetic fine - structure constant , and @xmath24 denote the electron and proton mass , respectively . since the standard model of particle physics gives us no clue about the relation of any of these four constants to each other ,",
    "this coincidence is truly amazing .",
    "it is very difficult to imagine how a fundamental theory , which would predict these relations , could lead to ( [ eqstar ] ) except by sheer coincidence .",
    "finally , a recently much discussed example of a comic coincidence is the observed value of the cosmological constant @xcite @xmath25 which is more than 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the `` natural '' scale set by the planck mass @xmath26 cut - off of quantum field theories .",
    "if @xmath27 were to exceed the observed value by a factor 200 or more , the universe would not have gone through the slow period of expansion that is required for the formation of large galaxies , and it is unlikely that life could have developed @xcite . even in supersymmetric models of grand unification",
    "the cosmological constant is at least 60 orders of magnitude larger than observed @xcite .",
    "the anthropic principle has been invoked to explain why the laws of nature and the numerical constants in these laws have the specific forms or values that are observed in nature .",
    "but this `` explanation '' comes at a cost : it postulates that , in some unspecified way , the universe at large `` knows '' about our existence . who ordered those values ?",
    "do we need a purposeful creator of the cosmos , after all ?",
    "scientific reasoning provides for a way out of this dilemma .",
    "our argument that the planet earth is special , but its existence is nonetheless probable because of the vast multitude of planets , leads us to the hypothesis that our universe may be a special , but probable representative of a multitude of universes , each with different properties .",
    "this hypothesis has several immediate implications , which may initially appear rather radical :    * our universe is only one among many others ; * the constants of nature and cosmological parameters must have different values in different universes ; * we happen to live in a universe where the laws of nature are conducive to the formation of intelligent life .",
    "a corollary of the second statement is that not all constants of nature can be derived from some fundamental theory ( [ eqstar ] ) .",
    "examples are the cosmological constant , the ratio of the @xmath18- and @xmath19-quark masses @xcite , and some constants entering into the relation .",
    "the universality and immutability of the fundamental laws of nature in our universe is well established by observations . how can this fact be reconciled with the concept of many universes governed by quantitatively different laws ?",
    "a possible resolution of this paradox relies on the special role of the vacuum state in modern quantum field theory .",
    "quantum mechanics dictates that even `` empty '' space is not empty , but rather filled with quantum fluctuations of all possible kinds .",
    "the uncertainty principle , @xmath28 , is inconsistent with the notion of an absolutely empty region of space - time .",
    "the physical reality of the quantum fluctuations can be measured by changing the geometry of a volume , leading to the so - called casimir force @xcite : two conducting metal plates separated by a distance @xmath29 attract each other with a force per unit area proportional to @xmath30 , which originates from the geometry dependence of the fluctuating modes of the electromagnetic field between the plates .",
    "quantum field theory distinguishes three different types of vacua : the trivial vacuum , characterized by fluctuations of the field around zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) , the higgs vacuum , characterized by fluctuations around a nonvanishing value of the field called the vacuum expectation value ( see fig .  [ fig3]b ) , and the false vacuum , where the field fluctuates around a metastable minimum of the potential energy curve ( see fig .  [",
    "because the false vacuum is only metastable , it eventually decays , releasing the energy difference between the local minimum and the true minimum of the field potential as thermal energy .",
    "the standard model uses the higgs vacuum to generate masses for the quarks and leptons , as well as for the gauge bosons of the weak interaction .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , @xmath31 gev , is uniquely determined in the standard model ; the quark and lepton masses differ from one another due to the different strength of the coupling of each fermion field to the higgs field . in models of grand unification ,",
    "the coupling strengths of the electroweak and strong interactions themselves depend on the expectation value of another higgs field , which breaks the underlying fundamental symmetry .",
    "in addition , the qcd vacuum contains quark and gluon condensates @xmath32 which generate additional dynamical masses for the three light quark flavours @xmath33 .",
    "modern cosmology makes use of the false vacuum to explain the large size and homogeneity of our universe , as well as the fact that it is filled with thermal radiation .",
    "because gravity couples to the full energy - momentum tensor @xmath34 , and the tensor for the false vacuum has a lorentz invariant structure with negative trace @xmath35 , the false vacuum effectively acts as a source of antigravity . in the context of the equations of general relativity",
    ", it leads to a law of exponential inflation of the radius of the universe : @xmath36 inflationary cosmology @xcite solves , at once , several of the fine - tuning problems of cosmology by stretching away any initial deviations from flatness , isotropy , and homogeneity .",
    "it also explains why the universe was born hot : the thermal background radiation is simply the thermalized remnant of the latent heat contained in the false vacuum that drove the cosmic inflation . in order to explain the observations , the linear size of the universe must have grown by at least 26 orders of magnitude , and possibly much more , during the early inflationary period @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the inflationary cosmological model contains in itself an additional unexpected , philosophically important insight . in most models of inflation , an infinite sequence of universes",
    "are created once inflation has started @xcite .",
    "the reason for this astonishing property is that the volume of space filled by the excited vacuum state inflates faster than the excited state can decay . in other words , as the false vacuum decays in one region of space , creating a new universe , the remaining space still filled with false vacuum continues to grow exponentially , allowing for the formation of other bubbles in which the excited vacuum decays , each one causally disconnected from all others .",
    "this process of `` eternal inflation '' results in a scenario where an unlimited number of universes develop in isolation , separated by rapidly stretching regions of space still filled with the false vacuum . numerical simulations of this scenario yield , at any given moment , the picture of a fractal `` multiverse '' filled with isolated bubbles that have set out on their big - bang evolution at various times in the past @xcite .",
    "the multiverse hypothesis can form as the basis of a solution to the problem of cosmic coincidences , if the true vacuum state is strongly degenerate , allowing the higgs fields to take on many different values , either at random or in response to subtle initial or boundary conditions . the quantitative laws of physics would then be different in each bubble universe , because they contain different vacua .",
    "the anthropic principle then simply implies that we live in one of those universes that are conducive to the formation of intelligent life .",
    "how can one probe the validity of these highly speculative concepts derived from the fusion of quantum field theory and cosmology ?",
    "scientists are proceeding along different avenues toward this goal :    1 .",
    "astronomers measure the vacuum fraction of the energy balance of our universe .",
    "this `` dark energy '' has been determined to make up about 70% of the cosmic energy content .",
    "high energy physicists search for the higgs boson in particle collisions at the fermilab tevatron and soon at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "nuclear physicists create conditions , similar to those after the big bang , in collisions of nuclei at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "string theorists construct models of theories with complex and degenerate vacuum states in higher dimensions .",
    "the third approach , relativistic heavy ion collisions , alone allows to explore the notion that the properties of particles and forces can be modified by a change in the vacuum state .",
    "the beam energies accessible at rhic are high enough to create temperatures commensurate with the energy scale of the qcd vacuum condensates and thus to affect the structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "numerical simulations of lattice qcd predict that a dramatic change in the qcd vacuum state occurs around a `` critical '' temperature @xmath37 mev , where the quark and gluon condensates melt and the vacuum takes on a trivial , perturbative structure .",
    "the part of the light quark masses that is induced by the quark condensate disappears above @xmath38 and only the much smaller mass generated by the electroweak higgs field remains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom corresponding to freely propagating gluons , which are frozen in the normal qcd vacuum , are also liberated above @xmath38 .",
    "this pattern is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which shows the dramatic jump in the scaled energy density @xmath39 at the critical temperature .         to the fourth power of the temperature @xmath40 is a measure of the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the rapid rise near @xmath41 indicates the liberation of colour at the transition from a gas of hadrons to a quark - gluon plasma ( from karsch @xcite ) . ]",
    "our universe began its life far above @xmath38 and cooled below @xmath38 after about 20 @xmath42s .",
    "the physics program of the rhic aspires to recreate this process in the collisions of two @xmath43au nuclei with energies of up to 100 gev per nucleon each @xcite . in the laboratory ,",
    "the two colliding nuclei appear highly lorentz contracted ( about 100-fold ) as they approach from opposite directions . as a consequence ,",
    "the immediate impact is extremely brief , leaving behind a highly excited region of space , a sort of `` false vacuum '' , as the debris from both nuclei recedes after the collision .",
    "the energy stored in the vacuum rapidly thermalizes due to the nonlinear , chaotic dynamics of colour fields , producing a small region of highly heated vacuum roughly of the size of a au nucleus .",
    "theoretical models , calibrated by the results from the first rhic experiments , suggest that space is heated up to about 250 mev , creating the proper conditions for a change in the qcd vacuum .    but how would we know that the predicted transformation actually occurs ?",
    "two effects caused by the disappearance of the vacuum condensates stand out : the melting of the quark condensate lowers the effective mass of the @xmath44-quark from about 500 mev to less than 150 mev , making it easy to create @xmath44-quark pairs in copious quantities @xcite .",
    "the dissolution of the gluon condensate allows gluons to exist as abundant thermal excitations on which energetic partons can scatter and degrade their energy @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest two critical signatures of the predicted structural change in the qcd vacuum : particles containing strange quarks should be produced in equilibrium abundances , and particles created by fragmentation of high energy quarks should be substantially suppressed compared with naive expectations , an effect that has become known as `` jet quenching '' @xcite .",
    "both predicted phenomena have , indeed , been observed in the rhic experiments , which we will review next .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider , shown in fig .  [ figr ] , is an accelerator complex of great versatility .",
    "in addition to collisions between au nuclei , it allows scientists to study collisions between two protons and even between heavy hydrogen ( deuterium ) nuclei and au nuclei .",
    "the latter serve as benchmarks for the phenomena occurring in the normal qcd vacuum at a given collision energy .",
    "the p+p and d+au collisions are not expected to create a region of heated vacuum and thus should not exhibit the specific effects predicted to be signatures of a modified qcd vacuum state . since the year 2000 , rhic has had three major experimental runs at collision energies of 130 gev and 200 gev per nucleon pair and involving all three systems mentioned above .",
    "a fourth run with colliding au beams has just been completed .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows that hadrons containing any number of @xmath44-quarks , up to three , are produced according to the expectation that a quark - gluon plasma converts into hadrons near the critical temperature .",
    "the value deduced from the data ( @xmath45 mev ) is equal to @xmath38 within the theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "measurements of the flow patterns of the emitted hadrons provide additional evidence that they are created directly from a phase of independent quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the experiment makes use of the fact that the region of heated vacuum is almond - shaped in semiperipheral collisions between two nuclei , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , leading to an anisotropic expansion pattern , called `` elliptic flow '' @xcite , and characterized by a parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the observed flow anisotropy is a function of the momentum of the emitted particles and varies from one hadron species to another ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] , left ) .",
    "the remarkable finding is that all flow patterns collapse onto a common line when they are plotted per constituent quark in each hadron ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , right ) , suggesting that one observes the flow pattern of individual quarks , which coalesce into hadrons only later @xcite .         of hadrons as function of the trannsverse momemtum differs by hadron species ( left figure ) .",
    "the different dependences collapse into a single one , if the elliptic flow per constituent quark is plotted as a function of the quark transverse momentum ( right figure).,title=\"fig : \" ]   of hadrons as function of the trannsverse momemtum differs by hadron species ( left figure ) .",
    "the different dependences collapse into a single one , if the elliptic flow per constituent quark is plotted as a function of the quark transverse momentum ( right figure).,title=\"fig : \" ]    basic principles of qcd mandate that the number of hadrons emitted at large momentum transverse to the beam axis should grow like the number of collisions between pairs of nucleons , when two nuclei collide . as we argued above , the scattered partons , from which these hadrons are produced ,",
    "are expected to suffer a substantial energy loss on the way out due to collisions with thermal gluons , if the qcd vacuum state is altered . in qcd ,",
    "the main mechanism for collisional energy loss is the radiation of a gluon by the struck parton , and this effect is predicted to grow in proportion to the length of the hot region traversed by the parton @xcite . because the yield of scattered partons falls rapidly as a function of the transverse momentum , this energy loss translates into a reduction in the yield at a fixed momentum .",
    "in fact , model calculations predict that most hadrons observed at a given momentum originate from partons scattered near the surfaces of the colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "200 gev collisions of two au nuclei ( from phenix collaboration ) . ]",
    "the rhic experiments clearly show the predicted suppression of high energy hadrons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "neutral pions with transverse momenta above 4 gev / c are emitted five times more rarely in head - on collisions of two au nuclei than extrapolated from the yield measured in @xmath47 collisions or grazing au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "this amount of suppression is consistent with that expected for a plasma containing free gluons at temperatures above @xmath38 .",
    "the suppression effect is not observed in d+au collisions , ruling out any initial - state effect associated with the properties of au nuclei @xcite .",
    "again , a difference in the behaviour of mesons and baryons helps to better understand what is going on : the suppression of baryon production only sets in at higher momenta , above 5 gev / c , because the coalescence of three quarks produces more energetic baryons than mesons , which contain only a single quark pair , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] @xcite .        to confirm the interpretation of these results ,",
    "two other effects will be explored , which are sensitive to the density of gluons in the hot qcd plasma .",
    "the first one makes use of the fact that a dense plasma of gluons screens the normally long - ranged colour force .",
    "the strength of the screening effect is measured by the inverse screening length @xmath42 , which is a function of the temperature @xmath40 .",
    "lattice simulations predict that the screening effect abruptly disappears as @xmath40 approaches @xmath38 from above @xcite , indicating the transition from a trivial qcd vacuum state to one filled with a gluon condensate .",
    "the idea is to detect the colour screening effect via the disappearance of bound states of a pair of heavy quarks , such as @xmath48 or @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "these states are denoted as @xmath50 and @xmath51 states , respectively .",
    "the recent high - statistics au+au run of rhic is expected to allow for a precise measurement of the change in the @xmath50 yield compared with extrapolations from @xmath47 collisions .",
    "another possible method of measuring the gluon density is by detecting energetic photons .",
    "these can either be created in the initial impact between the two nuclei , or during the passage of scattered , energetic quarks through the hot plasma @xcite .",
    "the first process can be accurately predicted by extrapolation from @xmath47 collisions , because the photons are not affected by the change in the qcd vacuum .",
    "a precise measurement of the yield of energetic photons , which is difficult due to the presence of a large background of secondary photons from meson decays , would permit an independent determination of the gluon density .",
    "through a series of observations and plausibity arguments , modern cosmology has led scientists to seriously consider the spectre of our universe as one among a vast multitude of universes , in which the laws of nature take on different forms . the inflationary cosmological model , which predicts an unlimited number of universes emerging in random succession from their individual big bang , is increasingly well supported by astrophysical evidence .",
    "the best way to reconcile the observed immutability of the laws of nature in our universe over the whole range of visible space and time with their posited variability from one cosmos to another is to consider this as an effect of the variability of the vacuum state .",
    "experiments with relativistic heavy ions allow us , for the first time , to verify that a vacuum state can be modified , causing dramatic changes in the properties of fundamental particles ( quarks and gluons ) and the strong forces between them .",
    "the theoretical tools developed to understand this process in detail will also help us to explore models of vacuum variability affecting other particles and forces , as suggested by cosmology .",
