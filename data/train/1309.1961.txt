    "first , let us suppose that both @xmath123 and @xmath124 have exactly two branch vertices , and that @xmath347 is a branch vertex of @xmath125 different from @xmath21 , for @xmath73 . if @xmath125 , for @xmath73 , does not have a vertex of degree  2 other than @xmath348 , for @xmath349 , then @xmath7 is a @xmath350 , and hence it satisfies ( iii ) of the theorem .",
    "so , we may assume that there is a vertex of degree  2 ( in @xmath7 ) in a branch of @xmath123 containing @xmath340 .",
    "if @xmath351 or @xmath352 is not an edge , then @xmath7 satisfies ( i ) of the theorem , so we may assume that @xmath351 and @xmath352 are edges .",
    "if @xmath353 is also an edge , then @xmath21 and @xmath354 form a pair of twins , and therefore @xmath7 satisfies  ( ii ) of the theorem . when @xmath353 is not an edge , then by symmetry @xmath355 and @xmath356 are edges . but then @xmath341 and @xmath357 form a pair of twins , and therefore @xmath7 satisfies ( ii ) of the theorem .    observe that if @xmath125 has at least three branch vertices , then , by induction hypothesis , there is a vertex @xmath358 of degree  2 in a branch of @xmath125 not having @xmath21 as its end , or @xmath125 has a pair of twins that does not contain @xmath21 ( since @xmath125 has at least three branch vertices ) .",
    "so if both @xmath123 and @xmath124 have at least three branch vertices , then the theorem holds .",
    "therefore we may assume that @xmath123 has at least three and @xmath124 exactly two branch vertices .",
    "if @xmath124 has a vertex2 @xmath359 of degree  2 not in @xmath360 , then @xmath7 satisfies  ( i ) or  ( ii ) of the theorem .",
    "so we may assume that the only vertices of @xmath124 of degree  2 are @xmath361 and @xmath357 , and therefore @xmath21 and the other branch vertex of @xmath124 form a pair of twins , hence @xmath7 satisfies ( ii ) or  ( iii ) .",
    "this completes the proof when @xmath7 has a star cutset .",
    "* proof when @xmath7 has a 6-join . *    we may assume that @xmath7 has no star cutset .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 does not contain a pair of twins ( for if @xmath362 is a pair of twins of @xmath7 , since @xmath7 has at least three branch vertices , @xmath363 , and hence @xmath364 is a star cutset ) .",
    "let @xmath91 be a split of a 6-join of @xmath7 and let @xmath365 .",
    "by lemma  [ 6jl1 ]  ( iii ) , @xmath148 for every @xmath366 and all nodes of @xmath2 are of degree  3 in @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that both blocks of decomposition @xmath123 and @xmath124 have at least three branch vertices . by the choice of @xmath7 , each of them has a vertex of degree  2 not in @xmath2 , and hence @xmath7 satisfies ( i ) of the theorem",

    "[ twins ] if @xmath7 is a cubic balanceable graph that is not @xmath11 , then @xmath7 has a pair of twins none of whose neighbors is a cut vertex of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath258 be an end block of @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath258 has at most one vertex of degree  2 , and all the other vertices of degree  3 .",
    "if @xmath258 does not have a vertex of degree  2 , then let @xmath368 , and otherwise let @xmath369 be the graph obtained from @xmath258 by subdividing twice an edge incident to the degree  2 vertex .",
    "clearly @xmath369 is 2-connected balanceable and not equal to @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath369 has at most one branch of length greater than 1 . by theorem  [ main",
    "] @xmath369 has a pair of twins @xmath370 .",
    "note that none of the neighbors of @xmath371 and @xmath359 in @xmath369 can be of degree  2 in @xmath369 , and hence @xmath370 is the desired pair of twins of @xmath7 .    as was noticed in  @xcite ( for the special case of cubic balanced graphs ) , corollary  [ twins ] implies the following .",
    "[ cr - cubic ] let @xmath7 be a cubic balanceable graph . then the following hold :    a.   @xmath7 has girth four .",

    "then all neighbors of @xmath371 and @xmath379 belong to @xmath36 , and in particular , @xmath359 belongs to @xmath36 and has three neighbors in @xmath36 , a contradiction .",
