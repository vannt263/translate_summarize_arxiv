    "lvy foraging hypothesis @xcite-@xcite suggests that a saltatory search composed of consecutive displacement lengths @xmath3 drawn from a power law distribution , @xmath4 with the scaling exponent @xmath5 approaching the theoretically optimal value @xmath6 would maximize forager s chance to locate sparsely and randomly distributed prey @xcite-@xcite and therefore presents an evolutionary beneficial alternative strategy to spatially intensive search . foraging movement patterns that fit closely to walks ( [ levy ] ) known as lvy flights @xcite were identified in many living spices ranging from microorganisms to humans @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , although the reported scaling exponents varied substantially for different animals , in different environmental contexts . the rate of flight lengths decay in the population data is typically described by a power law with an exponential cut - off revealing that an exponential decay rate dominates for extremely long travels @xcite .",
    "it was further suggested @xcite that while the distribution of displacements for the population aggregate appears to show a fat tail , the individual s bout distributions do not .",
    "furthermore , when movement lengths within tracks fit a brownian walk ( being exponentially distributed ) , but differ in the parameter of this exponential distribution , the power law with exponential cut - off in the population data would result from a superposition of these exponential distributions @xcite .",
    "the detailed statistically robust analysis of foraging trajectories of albatrosses @xcite provided strong support for individual character of search patterns : some trajectories were well approximated by truncated lvy flights ( [ levy ] ) , others fitted brownian movement patterns , while a significant portion of trajectories were not fitted by either distribution , as having both lvy and brownian features .",

    "a major problem for users of ve is maintaining knowledge of their location and orientation while they move through space , essentially when the whole path can not be viewed at once but occluded by objects in the environment @xcite .",
    "most of human spatial abilities ( such as navigating a large - scale space and identifying a place ) have evolved in natural environments over a very long time , using properties present in nature as cues for spatial orientation and wayfinding @xcite . however , many of natural body - based self - motion cues are absent in ve , causing systematic spatial orientation problems in subjects , and therefore calling for the instant invention of new adaptive strategies to move through ve , under reduced multisensory conditions .",

    "< , < , < \" , ]     the typical distribution of scanning turns , reorientations , and explorative rotation durations while exploring a ve is presented on fig .  [ fig_02ab ]",
    ". the areas of adjacent rectangles in the histogram are equal to the relative frequency of observations in the duration interval .",
    "the total area of the histograms is normalized to the number of data occurrences .",
    "the data show that the vast majority of all reorientations performed by subjects were the quick scanning turns , being the essential part of the adaptive walking routine in ve . the vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_02ab ] stands for the rotation duration of @xmath9_s _ ; the locations of the correspondent points , at which participants performed longer turns ( without translations ) are displayed on the floor plans by the circles ( see fig .  [ fig_02a].1 and [ fig_02a].2 ) .",
    "the diameter of a circle is proportionate to a number of long turns recorded at its central point over all subjects .",
    "several studies conducted on small animals @xcite , @xcite suggested that the switch between scanning and reorientation behaviour in movement patterns of animals that search emerges from complex mechanic - sensorial responses of animals to the local environment and could infer the effects of limited perception and/or a patchy environmental structure .",
    "when exploring patchy resources , animals could adjust turning angle distributions , selecting a preferred turning angle value that would allow organisms to stay within the patch for a proper amount of time , maximizing the energetic gain .",
    "for example , the zigzag motion of _ daphnia _ appears to be an optimal strategy for patch exploitation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the distinction between quick scanning turns and a longer reorientation behaviour is crucial to understand the statistical patterns of search @xcite .",
    "being a part of the travelling routine in ve , quick scanning turns performed by subjects during the walk induce correlations between turning the total rotation durations and the net displacements , on relatively small spatiotemporal scales sensitive to the local structural features of the environment . after reaching the natural limits of available space of unobstructed motion or entering a new movement zone",
    ", the subject performs a longer reorientation , perhaps in order to explore the new environment visually that breaks the correlations .",
    "we analyzed the data on durations of reorientations of subjects travelling through the both ve models with the use of the _ root mean square fluctuations _",
    "( rmsf ) suitable for detecting correlations @xcite .",
    "the rmsf of displacements is calculated by @xmath10 in which the net displacement of the walker by the @xmath11-th reorientation is @xmath12 @xmath13 is the recorded position of the @xmath14-th reorientation , @xmath15 and the angular brackets denote averaging over all data points @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , the rmsf of rotation durations is calculated by @xmath17 in which the total rotation duration of the subject by the @xmath11-th reorientation is @xmath18 @xmath19 is the duration of the @xmath14-th reorientation , @xmath20 and the angular brackets again denote the average over all data points . in fig .",
    "[ fig_05a ] , we juxtaposed the rmsf of the net displacement and the rmsf of the total rotation durations , in the log - log scale , for all recorded reorientations of subjects , separately for the ve models a and b. identically , for the both ve models , the graphs show the super linear slope , @xmath21 indicating the presence of a strong positive relation that reinforces the total duration of quick scanning turns , with the increase of the net displacement of subject . in the long run ,",
    "the correlations generated by the fast scale scanning behaviour vanish that is typical for a correlated random walk process @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the ranges of correlations of the rmsf of turning durations and the rmsf of net displacements in the ve models a and b were different : for the ve model a , the correlations exist in the range of the net displacements from 0.1 _ m _ to 6 _ m _ , and from 0.3 _ m _ to 10 _ m _ , for the ve model b. perhaps , the difference in the correlation ranges of the net displacements is due to the different size of an average space available for unobstructed movements , in the models a and b. it is obvious that such an intensive space scan is performed by subjects only within their immediate neighbourhoods and principally can not be extended neither to the entire ve , nor even to any of its significant parts , as the superlinear increase of required time makes the scanning process on large spatiotemporal scales biologically unfeasible .",
    "thus , after completing a phase of intensive search within the patch of a size depending on the structural properties of the environment , a treasure hunter moves to some other area , where the phase of intensive search is resumed .",
    "it is important to mention that changes in reorientation behaviour , on large spatiotemporal scales , can generate different anomalous diffusion regimes , which in turn , can affect the search efficiency of random exploration processes @xcite .      in order to identify phases of specific activity in recorded movement patterns and to reveal the underlying cognitive mechanisms from their statistical properties ,",
    "we have studied the probability distributions of time intervals and distances between consequent observable searching events ( door openings ) as they can determine strong changes in the diffusive properties of movement and in relevant spatial properties of the trajectories .",
    "the distributions representing the data on dispersal of the treasure hunters during the experiments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for both ve models .",
    "gender is found as a factor influencing navigation in ve : males were reported to acquire route knowledge from landmarks faster than females @xcite and to spend less time in locating targets @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the form of the empirically observed distributions ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) were neither gender specific , nor sensitive to the different global structure of the environments .",
    "the data show that the most of consequent door openings happens in the immediate neighbourhood of the actual position of a participant .",
    "the dispersal statistics on the small spatiotemporal scales shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be well approximated by uncorrelated gaussian random walks ( see the dotted bell shaped curve ) insensitive to the local structure of the environment .",
    "the both distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are remarkable for the long right tails dominated by the _",
    "quadratic hyperbolas _ attenuating the super - diffusive spread of treasure hunters on large spatiotemporal scales .",
    "a power - law tail in the probability distributions of both travelling times and travelled distances could arise from processes , in which neither time , nor distance have a specific characteristic scale , so that rare but extremely long and far cry , explorative travels can occur , alternating between sequences of many relatively short , exploitative travels featuring local searches .",
    "the power - law tails in the dispersal data provide an evidence in favour of a strong coupling between the large - scale movements along the paths which can not be viewed at once @xcite and the environmental structure . as in many empirical phenomena , the tails of the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] follow a power law only for values greater than some minimum scales @xmath22 in space ( about 10_m _ ) and in time ( about 20_sec _ ) that is consistent with the conclusion of the previous section about the dynamic formation of immediate neighbourhoods , in which subjects perform intensive scanning .",
    "our observations are in agreement with the hypothesis that both travelling times and travelled distances observed over the group of people participated in the study were drawn from a scale invariant distribution of the form @xmath23 and thus do not change for @xmath24 if scales are multiplied by a common factor .",
    "however , it is important to note that statistics of dispersion estimated over a sample of individual searching behaviour could be as different from the power law ( [ levy ] ) as following an exponential distribution , as many of these samples were not statistically representative .",
    "therefore , although the power - law tails of the distributions shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] are consistent with the lvy foraging hypothesis @xcite-@xcite , they rather represent a group aggregate feature .    geometrically , discrete - step random walks with movement displacements drawn from the lvy distribution consist of walking clusters with very large displacements between them repeated over a wide range of scales @xcite .",
    "although lvy flights are ubiquitous for representing intermittent search , cruise , and foraging strategies in living spices to our knowledge , this is the first report on the observation of lvy flight search patterns in humans exploring the ve .",
    "the observed statistical properties of human search behaviour in the ve call for a model that could exhibit the scale - invariant characteristic of a critical point of a phase transition ( correspondent to the super - diffusive scale - free spread described by the lvy distribution ) spontaneously , without the need to tune any control parameter to precise values . in statistical physics ,",
    "such a property of dynamical systems is known as self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a plausible model has to be of a discrete nature , as the biological principle of intermittent locomotion assumes that animal behaviour unavoidably produces observable punctuations , `` producing pauses and speeding patterns on the move '' @xcite .",
    "these motivations reflect a fundamental `` trade - off '' confronted by a treasure hunter choosing between an _ exploitation _ of the scanning movement routine within the familiar environment of nearest neighbourhood , possibly at no reward , and a fast relocation aiming at _ exploration _ of unknown but potentially more rewarding areas .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", it is known that in a stationary setting there exists an optimal strategy for exploration @xcite maximizing the reward over an infinite horizon when the value of each reward is discounted exponentially as a function of when it is acquired . however , to date , there is no generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem @xcite , as human and other animals are prone to _ dynamically update _ their estimates of rewards in response to diverse , mutable and perhaps discrepant factors , including elapsed time of search , annoying failures to predict the location of a searched object , and instantaneous mood swings that could change in a matter of seconds .",
    "therefore , it seems that a stochastic model managing a balance between exploration and exploitation may be more biologically realistic @xcite .",
    "there is growing evidence that the neuromodulatory system involved in assessing reward and uncertainty in humans is central to the exploration - exploitation trade - off decision @xcite .",
    "the problem can be cast in terms of a distinction between _ expected uncertainty _ , coming from known unreliability of predictive cues and coded in the brain by a neuromodularity system with acetylcholine signals , and _ unexpected uncertainty _ , triggered by strongly unexpected observations promoting exploration and coded in the brain with norepinephrine signals @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that an individual decides on whether to stay or to go according to the current levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine , encoding the different types of uncertainty .",
    "summarizing the above mentioned arguments , we are interested in a self - organized critical model driven by a discrete time random process of competing between two factors featuring the different types of uncertainty .",
    "various coherent - noise models possessing the plausible features were discussed @xcite in connection to the standard sand pile model @xcite developed in self - organized criticality , where the statistics of avalanche sizes and durations also take a power law form .",
    "the movement ecology framework @xcite explicitly recognizes animal movement as a result of a continuous `` dialogue '' between environmental cues ( external factors ) and animal internal states @xcite . in our model",
    ", we rationalize the dialogue nature of a decision making process to take on searching in highly unpredictable situation when no precise information on a possibility of rewards is available . despite its inherent simplicity , the mathematical model formulated below can help generate hypothesis about fundamental biological processes and bring a possibility to look for a variety of biological mechanisms under a common perspective .",
    "we assume that an individual decides on whether to exploit an immediate neighbourhood by search beyond a next door or to explore other parts of the environment yet to be visited by comparing the guessed chances , @xmath25 $ ] of getting a reward beyond the next door and @xmath26 $ ] of finding a treasure elsewhere afar .",
    "it is not necessary that @xmath27 we suppose that at each time click subject updates one or both estimates and decides to proceed to a part of the environment yet to be explored if @xmath28 . otherwise , if @xmath29 she picks a next door randomly among those not yet opened and searches for a treasure in the room behind .",
    "we consider @xmath30 and @xmath31 to be the random variables distributed over the interval @xmath32 $ ] with respect to the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . in general ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are two arbitrary left - continuous increasing functions satisfying the normalization conditions @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "we model the intermittent search patterns by a discrete time random process in the following way . at time",
    "@xmath39 the variable @xmath31 is chosen with respect to pdf @xmath35 , and @xmath30 can chosen with respect to pdf @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath28 , subject relocates by pressing a button on the controller and goes to time @xmath40 . given a fixed real number @xmath41,$ ] at time @xmath42 ,",
    "the following events happen :    \\(i ) with probability @xmath43 , the chance to find a treasure in the immediate neighbourhood ( @xmath31 ) is estimated with pdf @xmath44 and the chance to get a reward elsewhere ( @xmath30 ) is chosen with pdf @xmath45    otherwise ,    \\(ii ) with probability @xmath46 , the chance to find a treasure in the immediate neighbourhood ( @xmath31 ) is estimated with pdf @xmath44 but the chance to find it elsewhere ( @xmath30 ) keeps the value it had at time @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath43 quantifies the degree of coherence between the two stochastic sub - processes characterized by the pdf @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively : the processes are coherent if @xmath48 and incoherent as @xmath49    if @xmath50 , the local search phase continues ; however if @xmath28 , subject presses the controller button and moves further , going to time @xmath51 . eventually , at some time step @xmath52 , when the estimated chance @xmath31 exceeds the value @xmath30 , subject stops and resumes searching within the immediate neighbourhood .",

    "[ fig66 ] , we have presented the probability distributions of the searching durations for increasing values of @xmath113    the proposed mathematical model suggests that the algebraic tail dominated by a quadratic hyperbola observed in the distribution of time intervals and between sequential phases of searching activity ( see fig .

    "[ fig1 ] for the large scales @xmath24 . contrasted to locomotion in real environments , mobility in ve depends upon self - motion perception in virtual space and convenience of locomotion interface , rather than on physiological factors of an individual such as height , weight , age , or fitness .",
    "the instantaneous translation velocity in the ve is kept constant for any individual , as long as she presses a button .",
    "therefore the scale - free distribution of time intervals induces the scale - free distribution of travelling distances , with the same scaling exponent .",
    "we have shown that when balancing the chances to be rewarded in the immediate neighbourhood ( now and here ) and later elsewhere ( then and there ) amid uncertainty subject estimates both uniformly at random at each step ( @xmath115 ) , the inverse quadratic tail always dominates the bout distributions on large spatiotemporal scales , so that observed walking behaviour is reminiscent of lvy flights .",
    "thus while searching for a sparsely and randomly located objects , subjects would adopt an explorative movement strategy that takes the advantage of lvy stochastic process , in order to minimize the mean time for target detection or mean first - passage time to a random target , as well as to maximize the energetic gain in case of sparsely and randomly distributed resources , since the probability of returning to a previously visited site is smaller for a lvy flight than for the usual random walk @xcite . however , if subject is convinced about the chance to get rewarded for exploration keeping this estimated value @xmath30 fixed , the value of @xmath43 slides from @xmath103 to @xmath116 ( the two stochastic sub - processes become incoherent ) , and the walking statistics is tuned out from the power law ( [ eq12 ] ) to the brownian walks characterized by the exponential decay @xmath117 ( see fig .",

    "the analysis of the root mean square fluctuations of displacements and turning durations gives us a conclusive evidence of that the total reorientation durations are strongly reinforced with the net displacement of subjects that makes the intensive scanning process biologically unfeasible , on large spatiotemporal scales .",
    "in absence of any specific cues marking the location of hidden treasures , subjects searched in a saltatory fashion : they marched along corridors and across halls , paused for the local search in the nearest rooms , and then resumed traversing the ve . in built environments , the area of an intensive local search",
    "is naturally limited to space available for the unobstructed movement , in which the searching activity in humans is characterized by the usual diffusive spread . however , on large scales , the searching behaviour has the super - diffusive characteristics : we have found that the empirical distributions of time intervals and distances between consequent searching events are dominated by the quadratic hyperbolas that fits the lvy flight patterns identified in the intermittent search , cruise , and foraging behaviours of many living organisms .",
    "contrary to previous approaches focused primarily on applying various statistical methods for the detection of lvy flight patterns in the available empirical data , without discussing the possible biological mechanisms causing the super - diffusive spread of searching activity in unpredictable environments , we have suggested a simple stochastic model of the coherent - noise type describing the exploration - exploitation trade - off in humans . according to our model , the saltatory search behaviours in humans can be featured by balancing between exploration and exploitation amid uncertainty ( `` should i stay or should i go '' ) in a way of a regularly recurring comparison of estimated chances to find a treasure in an immediate neighbourhood and to get rewarded in other parts of the environment yet to be explored .",
    "we have solved the model analytically and investigated the statistics of possible outcomes of such an exploration - exploitation trade - off process .",
    "it is important to mention that our model exhibits a variety of saltatory behaviours , ranging from lvy flights occurring under uncertainty ( when chances to get rewarded for the further exploration are revaluated by subjects recurrently , at each step ) to brownian walks , with an exponential distribution of movement bouts , taking place when subject s estimation of the chance of success remains stable over time ( although not necessary high ) .",
    "our model of decision making amid uncertainty provides a possible explanation for the appearance of lvy flight patterns in the foraging behaviour of animals occupying unpredictable environments , such as habitats with sparsely distributed resource fields or in new environments where experience may not help , as well as switching between different types of behaviours toward the more intensive searching strategy that could occur during a single trip of a treasure hunter confident of the eventual success .",
