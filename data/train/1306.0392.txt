    "@xmath23 from which the faber - krahn inequality easily follows .",
    ".2 cm the fact that balls can be characterized as the only sets for which equality holds in , naturally leads to consider the question of its _",
    "stability_. more precisely , one would like to improve , by adding in its right - hand side a reminder term measuring the deviation of a set @xmath5 from spherical symmetry .",
    "a typical quantitative faber - krahn inequality then reads as follows @xmath24 is a modulus of continuity and @xmath25 is some scaling invariant _",
    "asymmetry functional_. the quest for quantitative versions like is not new and has attracted an increasing interest in the last years . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first ones to prove partial results in this direction have been hansen and nadirashvili in @xcite and melas in @xcite .",
    "both papers treat the case of simply connected sets in dimension @xmath26 or the case of convex sets in general dimensions .",
    "these pioneering results prove inequalities like , with a modulus of continuity ( typically a power function ) depending on the dimension @xmath27 and with the following asymmetry functionals . ]",
    "@xmath28 like in @xcite , or @xmath29 as in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that for general sets an estimate like with the previous asymmetry functionals _ can not be true _ ( just think of a ball with a small hole at the center ) . in the general case ,",
    "a better notion of asymmetry is the so called _ fraenkel asymmetry _ , defined as @xmath30 where the symbol @xmath8 now stands for the symmetric difference between sets .",
    "for such an asymmetry functional , bhattacharya and weitsman @xcite and nadirashvili @xcite indipendently conjectured the following .",
    "there exists a dimensional constant @xmath31 such that @xmath32 on the asymmetry can not be replaced by any smaller power .",
    "indeed one can verify that the family of ellipsoids @xmath33 are such that @xmath34 we mention that the following weaker version of was already known , @xmath35 obtained by bhattacharya @xcite ( for the case @xmath26 ) and more recently by fusco , maggi and pratelli in @xcite for the general case .",
    "for ease of completeness , we also mention @xcite and @xcite for similar partial results and some probabilistic applications .",
    "actually , we are going to prove a slightly more general version of .",
    "to state our result , let us consider the following optimal poincar - sobolev constants for the embedding @xmath36 @xmath37 where the exponent @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 of course , when @xmath40 we are back to the principal frequency mentioned at the beginning .",
    "we also point out that for @xmath41 , the quantity @xmath42 is usually referred to as the _ torsional rigidity _ of the set @xmath5 . observe that the shape functional @xmath43 verifies the scaling law @xmath44 the exponent @xmath45 being negative .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath46 is scaling invariant .",
    "still by means of schwarz symmetrization , the following general family of faber - krahn inequalities can be derived @xmath47 is any @xmath13dimensional ball .",
    "again , equality in is possible if and only if @xmath5 is a ball .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following sharp quantitative improvement of .",
    "[ thm : fkstability ] let @xmath38 be an exponent verifying .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath48 , depending only on the dimension @xmath27 and @xmath38 , such that for every open set @xmath49 with finite measure we have latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : fkstability }     as already mentioned , by choosing @xmath40 we obtain a proof of the bhattacharya - weitsman and nadirashvili conjecture .",

    "* remark 3.6 ) , the above theorem allows to improve the exponent in the quantitative stability inequality for the second dirichlet eigenvalue of the laplacian proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.5 ) .",
    "we start recalling the usual strategy used to derive quantitative versions of faber - krahn inequalities . as the proof of",
    "is based on the plya - szeg principle , the central core of all the already exhisting stability results is represented by talenti s proof of ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this combines the coarea formula , the convexity of the function @xmath51 and the standard isoperimetric inequality latexmath:[\\[\\label{isosciarpa }    applied to the superlevel sets of a function @xmath20 achieving @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the perimeter of a set .",
    "the main idea of the papers @xcite and @xcite is that of substituting the classical isoperimetric statement with an improved quantitative version . for simply connected sets in dimension @xmath26 or for convex sets one can appeal to the so called _ bonnesen inequalities _ ( see @xcite ) , like in @xcite .",
    "more generally , one can apply the striking recent result of @xcite , proving a sharp quantitative version of valid for every set and every dimension .",
    "then the main difficulty is that of estimating the `` propagation of asymmetry '' from the superlevel sets of the optimal function @xmath20 to the whole domain @xmath5 . this is a very delicate step , which usually results in a ( non sharp ) estimate like the ones recalled above .",
    "it is worth mentioning the recent paper @xcite for some recent developments on quantitative versions of the plya - szeg principle .",
    ".2 cm in this paper on the contrary , we use a different strategy .",
    "indeed , the proof of our main theorem is based on the _ selection principle _ introduced by cicalese and leonardi in @xcite to give a new proof of the previously recalled quantitative isoperimetric inequality of @xcite .",
    "the selection principle turns out to be a very flexible technique and after the paper @xcite it has been applied to a wide variety of geometric problems , see for instance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "up to now however it has been used only for problems where the main term is given , roughly speaking , by the of @xmath5 .",
    "as we will explain below , this is due to the fact the selection principle highly relies on the regularity theory for sets minimizing some ( perturbed ) shape functional .",
    "if the dominating term of the functional is given by a area - type term , then well developed techniques in geometric measure theory ensure the desired regularity .",
    ".2 cm let us now explain the main ideas behind our proof .",
    "first by an application of the _ kohler - jobin inequality _ ( @xcite ) we will show in section [ sec : kj ] that is implied by the following inequality @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a dimensional constant and @xmath57 is the ball of radius @xmath58 and centered at the origin . here",
    "@xmath59 is the _ energy functional _ of @xmath5 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ( unique ) function achieving the above minimum .",
    "suppose now by contradiction that is false .",
    "since it is pretty easy to see that can only fail in the small asymmetry regime ( i.e. on sets converging in @xmath62 to the ball ) , we find a sequence of sets @xmath63 such that latexmath:[\\[\\label{contraintro }    with @xmath56 as small as we wish .",
    "we now look for an `` improved '' sequence of sets @xmath65 , still contradicting and enjoying some additional smoothness properties . in the spirit of ekeland",
    "s variation principle , these sets will be selected through some minimization problem . roughly speaking we look for sets @xmath65 which solve the following",
    "@xmath66 one can easily show that the sequence @xmath65 still contradict and that @xmath67 ( see lemma [ lm : prop1 ] ) . relying on the minimality of @xmath65",
    ", one then would like to show that the @xmath62 convergence to @xmath57 can be improved to a smooth convergence .",
    "if this is the case , then the second order expansion of @xmath59 for smooth nearly spherical sets done in section [ sec : fuglede ] shows that can not hold true if @xmath56 is sufficiently small .",
    "the key point is thus to prove ( uniform ) regularity estimates for sets solving . for this , first one would like to get rid of volume constraints applying some sort of lagrange multiplier principle to show that @xmath65 minimizes @xmath68 then , taking advantage of the fact that we are considering a `` min  min '' problem , the previous is equivalent to require that @xmath69 minimizes @xmath70 among all functions with compact support .",
    "since we are now facing a perturbed free boundary type problem , we aim to apply the techniques of alt and caffarelli @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to show the regularity of @xmath71 and to obtain the smooth convergence of @xmath65 to @xmath57 .",
    "0.2 cm even if this will be the general strategy , several non - trivial modifications have to be done to the above sketched proof .",
    "first of all , although solutions to enjoy some mild regularity property , we can not expect @xmath72 to be smooth .",
    "indeed , by formally computing the optimality condition where @xmath73 is a smooth vector field , see appendix [ sec : shape ] and lemma [ lm : el ] below . ] of and assuming that @xmath57 is the unique optimal ball for @xmath74 in",
    ", one gets that @xmath75 should satisfy @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the characteristic function of a set @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the outer normal versor .",
    "this means that the normal derivative of @xmath75 is discontinuous at points where @xmath80 crosses @xmath81 . since classical elliptic regularity implies that if @xmath82 is @xmath83 then @xmath84 , it is clear that the sets @xmath65 can not enjoy too much smoothness properties .    to overcome this difficulty , inspired by @xcite",
    ", we replace the fraenkel asymmetry with a new `` distance '' between a set @xmath5 and the set of balls , which behaves like a squared @xmath85 distance between the boundaries ( see definition [ defalpha ] ) . in particular",
    "it dominates the square of the fraenkel asymmetry ( see lemma [ lem : alphaprop ] ) and it is differentiable with respect to the variations needed to compute the optimality conditions ( see lemma [ lm : el ] ) .",
    "a second technical difficulty is that no global lagrange multiplier principle is available . indeed , since the energy @xmath86 is negative and @xmath87 by a simple scaling argument one sees that the infimum of is identically @xmath88 . reducing to a priori bounded set and following @xcite , we can however replace the term @xmath89 with a term of the form @xmath90 , for a suitable strictly increasing function vanishing when @xmath91 , see lemma [ torsionelimitato ] below . at this point",
    "we are able to perform the strategy described above to obtain for uniformly bounded sets @xmath5 , with a constant @xmath92 depending on @xmath93 .    in section [ sec : second ]",
    "we will finally show how to pass from bounded to general sets .",
    "for this last step , we will take advantage of the non - optimal quantitative stability inequality proved in @xcite .",
    "for every @xmath1 open set with finite measure , the _ energy functional _ is defined as @xmath94 the function @xmath95 achieving the above minimum is unique and will be called _ energy function of @xmath5 _ , and it satisfies @xmath96 in weak sense . multiplying the above equation by @xmath95 and integrating by parts one sees that @xmath97 by means of an easy homogeneity argument , we have @xmath98 in other words @xmath59 coincides with the opposite of the torsional rigidity of @xmath5 ( up to the multiplicative factor @xmath99 ) . in particular we should pay attention to the fact that @xmath59 _ is always a negative quantity_. then the faber - krahn inequality for @xmath41 can now be rewritten @xmath100 where @xmath101 is any ball and equality can hold if and only if @xmath5 itself is a ball .",
    "sometimes we will refer to this inequality as the _ saint - venant inequality_. .2 cm the quantity @xmath102 defined in and the energy functional are linked by the following `` isoperimetric '' inequality , due to marie - thrse kohler - jobin ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thorme 1 ) ) , see also @xcite for some recent generalizations of this inequality .",

    "it is well - known that for @xmath120 we have @xmath121 and the latter is the best costant in the sobolev inequality , a quantity which does not depend on the set @xmath5 .",
    "clearly this implies that the constant @xmath48 in must converge to @xmath122 as @xmath38 goes to @xmath123 .",
    "a closer inspection of the proof of proposition [ prop : trick ] shows that @xmath124 as @xmath38 goes to @xmath123 .",
    "the conformal case @xmath26 is a little bit different . in this case",
    "we have ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.2 ) ) @xmath125 for every set @xmath5 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the constant @xmath48 is then given by @xmath126 as @xmath38 goes to @xmath127 .",
    "in this section we show the validity of a stronger form of for sets smoothly close to the ball @xmath57 of unit radius and centered at the origin .",
