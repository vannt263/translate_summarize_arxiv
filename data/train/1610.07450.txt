    "we consider the problem of describing how pedestrians exit an environment . from a macroscopic point of view , we identify the crowd through the pedestrians density , say @xmath0 , and assume that the crowd behavior is well described by the continuity equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the environment available to pedestrians , @xmath3 is the velocity of the individual at @xmath4 , given the presence of the density @xmath5 .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that the individual at @xmath4 follows the shortest path from @xmath4 towards the nearest exit .",
    "this naturally suggests to choose @xmath9 parallel to @xmath10 , the potential @xmath11 being the solution to the eikonal equation on @xmath12 . extending the results in  @xcite obtained in the 1-dimensional space to the 2-dimensional space , we consider the following elliptic regularization of the eikonal equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a fixed strictly positive parameter .",
    "clearly , the resulting vector field @xmath15 depends only on @xmath12 , namely only on the geometry of the environment available to the pedestrians , i.e. , on the positions of the exits , on the possible presence of obstacles , and so on .",
    "we assume that the boundary @xmath16 is partitioned in walls , say @xmath17 , exits , say @xmath18 , and corners , say @xmath19 ; namely @xmath20 , the set @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 being two by two disjoint .",

    "finally , the evolution of the crowd density @xmath5 is then found solving the following scalar conservation law : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial crowd distribution . in other words , for a given domain @xmath12 , from   we obtain the vector field @xmath32 , that is used in   to define @xmath9 and then from   we obtain how the pedestrians density @xmath5 evolves in time starting from the initial density @xmath31 .",
