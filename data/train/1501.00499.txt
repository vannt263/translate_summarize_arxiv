    "the observed high - latitude radio sky is dominated by a bright diffuse component .",
    "although the existence of this component has been recognized for over 30 years @xcite , its origin remains unclear .",
    "proposed explanations range from a localized enhancement in the synchrotron emissivity @xcite to galactic halo emission @xcite to an extragalactic radio background @xcite .",
    "the observed diffuse high latitude radio emission is unusual in several respects .",
    "it lacks a counterpart at far - infrared wavelengths , violating the tight radio / far - ir correlation observed on scales ranging from as small as tens of pc to as large as entire galaxies@xcite . an extragalactic origin for the emission would require a previously unobserved population of faint ( sub-@xmath0jy ) radio sources @xcite .",
    "to avoid limits on statistical fluctuations in deep radio surveys , such a population may need to exceed the number of galaxies in the universe @xcite .",
    "no such source population has yet been found @xcite . on the other hand , a galactic origin for the emission would require substantial modification to both the cosmic ray and magnetic field distributions @xcite and would likely overproduce the observed x - ray background via inverse - compton radiation @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of multi - frequency radio data by @xcite ( hereafter sc ) places the bulk of the observed diffuse high - latitude radio emission into a spherical halo extending @xmath115 kpc from the galactic center . to the extent that the radio halo radius is large compared to the kpc scale height of the diffuse dust emission ,",
    "the model provides a mechanism to evade the usual radio / far - ir correlation .",
    "however , the model predicts that the galaxy , viewed by an external observer , should show an extended radio halo with surface brightness at a substantial fraction of the galactic disk . in this work ,",
    "we use interferometric radio surface brightness contour maps of nearby normal edge - on spiral galaxies to search for a similarly bright and extended halo .",
    "figure [ model_figure ] shows the relevant features of the sc model .",
    "the diffuse radio sky is fit to a disk component , consisting of an ellipsoid with semi - major axis in the galactic plane and semi - minor axis toward the galactic poles , plus a spherical halo component .",
    "the model additionally includes an isotropic extragalactic background as well as an anisotropic contribution from the sum of galactic sources , loops , spurs , and filaments .    the sc model parameters ( extragalactic intensity plus the dimensions and volume emissivities for the ellipsoidal and halo components ) are derived by fitting the angular distribution of single dish radio maps at 150 , 408 , or 1420 mhz .",
    "the resulting halo component contains a substantial fraction of the high - latitude radio brightness .",
    "for example , at 1420 mhz the sc model yields a halo radius 1.8 times the radius of the solar circle , with halo brightness ( viewed toward the poles ) nearly half that of the disk component viewed in the plane .",
    "the relative importance of the disk and halo components depends on the observing frequency .",
    "the halo component is dominated by synchrotron emission , while the disk component and source components include non - trivial contribution from free - free emission .",
    "we adopt the sc model to search for a similar bright halo among a sample of nearby edge - on spiral galaxies .     ,",
    "width=316 ]    the dimensions and volume emissivities for the disk and halo components in the sc model specify the large - scale features of the diffuse model emission .",
    "there is also an anisotropic component consisting of sources , loops , and filaments originating from the galactic plane .",
    "we approximate this component using maps of the radio sky at 1420 @xcite and 408 mhz @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure [ source_fig ] shows the anisotropic component after subtracting the sc model best - fit disk , halo , and extragalactic components from the 1420 mhz survey .",
    "the bulk of the anisotropic emission is concentrated in the galactic plane .",
    "we model the planar anisotropic emission , as seen by an external observer , using the measured longitudinal distribution as viewed from our vantage point within the galaxy .",
    "we take the anisotropic contribution for a strip at latitude @xmath2 and longitudes @xmath3 then add the contribution in the opposite direction ( @xmath4 ) to get the combined emission for lines of sight interior to the solar circle .",
    "we then convert the longitudinal profile to linear distance from the galactic center and extrapolate the resulting profile to match the major axis length of the diffuse disk component , assuming uniform volume emissivity beyond the solar circle .    .",
    "contours are shown at 0.4 and 0.8 k. ( bottom ) simplified model of anisotropic component as viewed by an external observer .",
    "contours are shown at 0.1 k and 0.4 k. all panels use the same linear color bar .",
    "[ source_fig ] , width=336 ]    although the bulk of the anisotropic emission is concentrated in the galactic plane , fainter features extend to higher latitude , with typical amplitude 0.5 k at latitude @xmath5 .",
    "we model the combined contribution of faint extended features as an additional ellipsoidal component of uniform emissivity to add to the anisotropic component in the plane to achieve a full model of the source component .",
    "we adopt a major axis length equal to the length of the planar component and conservatively adopt a scale height of 2 kpc to maximize the potential confusion of this component with a bright spherical halo .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ source_fig ] shows the resulting combined model of anisotropic emission as viewed by an external observer .",
    "we can scale the anisotropic component brightness in frequency by a position - dependent spectral index derived by comparing this component in maps at 408 and 1420 mhz , with typical value -2.5 .",
    "since we search for evidence of a halo extending well beyond a few kpc , our results are insensitive to the details of the anisotropic component ( see the discussion in @xmath63 ) .",
    "figure [ model_contours ] shows the predicted brightness distribution for the full sc disk@xmath7halo@xmath7source model at 1500 mhz , as viewed edge - on by an external observer .",
    "both the dominant plane and fainter halo components are apparent .",
    "contours near the peak surface brightness trace the plane component , while contours at lower surface brightness have the potential to trace the halo component .",
    "the ability of a contour to distinguish between the two components depends on both angular resolution and surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "observations at low surface brightness for which beam smearing is not too severe are potentially sensitive to the halo component , while those at higher surface brightness or larger beam width are dominated by the plane component .",
    "the transition from elongated contours near the peak surface brightness to circular contours at lower surface brightness suggests a test for halo emission .",
    "we select a contour from a radio map of an external edge - on spiral galaxy and measure the major axis @xmath8 and the minor axis @xmath9 for that contour .",
    "the axial ratio @xmath10 is a measure of the ellipticity , with large values corresponding to highly elliptical distributions and low values tending toward circular .",
    "we then compare the observed axial ratio to the prediction from the model given the observed contour level ( specified either as an absolute brightness temperature or a fraction of the peak surface brightness ) , inclination , and beam width .",
    "we use radio surveys of nearby edge - on spiral galaxies to determine the relative abundance of extended bright radio halos .",
    "we restrict analysis to nearby galaxies to enable mapping with sufficient angular resolution to distinguish a spherical halo ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) , and to galaxies with inclination angle @xmath11 to reduce confusion between the disk and halo components .",
    "the relative importance of the disk and halo components depends on the observing frequency .",
    "we thus consider only galaxies mapped at frequencies between 150 and 1500 mhz to minimize scaling uncertainties and to concentrate on frequencies where the halo is most prominent .",
    "we consider radio contour maps of edge - on spiral galaxies at 1400 - 1500 mhz provided in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , along with those at 1400 mhz and 330 mhz in @xcite , 1407 mhz and 408 mhz in @xcite , and 1465 mhz and 308 mhz in @xcite .",
    "we additionally consider 16 of the 18 galaxies with @xmath11 mapped at 1490 mhz by @xcite .",
    "the two we exclude are m82 and m104 , which are an irregular starburst and a liner , respectively , and therefore not representative of milky way - like spirals .",
    "this leads to a total of 34 nearly edge - on spiral galaxies mapped at or near 1500 mhz , of which three are also mapped at or near 408 mhz , and of which ten are mapped twice at or near 1500 mhz , for a total of 47 individual maps . as discussed in @xmath6[compsec ] , only a subset of these maps have the sensitivity to distinguish the presence or absence of an extended halo similar to that in the sc model .",
    "interferometric observations are insensitive to structure on angular scales larger than a certain limit , corresponding to the length scale of the shortest baseline .",
    "the resulting loss of sensitivity to extended structures can mask the presence of radio halos . for the present analysis we selected those observations from the literature where this would not be a significant limitation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which together provide the majority of contour maps used in this analysis , use very large array ( vla ) observations in c or d configuration .",
    "the shortest baseline is 35 m , corresponding to angular scales of 970  at 1500 mhz . with the exception of one galaxy ,",
    "the largest angular scale in the vla data near 1500 mhz used here is 836 , within the vla s resolving capabilities . in the case of maps of ngc 0253",
    "the major axis angular size exceeds this scale but the minor axis does not , so these maps may still be sensitive to the presence of a spherical halo , and the halo structure seen in these maps is consistent with combined interferometric and single - dish data at 5 ghz @xcite .",
    "the shortest baseline in the australia national telescope facility s compact array , used in the observations of @xcite , is 30.6 m , enabling observations well beyond the 685  used in this work .",
    "the westerbork synthesis radio telescope , used in the observations of @xcite , has a shortest baseline of 36 m , with a largest observable structure of 840  at 1420 mhz , which is larger than the 700  maximum extent of the largest contour in that work .",
    "the ooty synthesis radio telescope , used for the maps in @xcite , has a largest observable structure of 40  @xcite .",
    "lastly , the cambridge one mile telescope used for the observations in @xcite has an adjustable baseline .",
    "the precise configuration used in those observations is not readily available in the literature , making it difficult to estimate the maximum scale of resolvable structure for the one galaxy from that work .",
    "we test for the presence of a bright radio halo by measuring the axial ratio @xmath10 of edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "we fit the sc model parameters ( including the anisotropic source component ) to individual power laws in frequency to scale the model to the observed frequency .",
    "we then create a contour map of the resulting model ( including the effects of galaxy inclination and observing beam width ) and measure the axial ratio of the model at the same contour as the faintest contour in the radio data , thereby providing a direct comparison of the model to observations .",
    "not all of the radio maps are sensitive to extended diffuse emission , although in all maps the faintest contour is the contour most likely to be sensitive . as seen in figure [ model_contours ] , when the faintest contour is not at a sufficiently low surface brightness it is dominated by emission in the plane regardless of the presence or absence of a radio halo . in maps with significant beam smearing , even the faintest contour can not distinguish between ( convolved ) planar emission and diffuse extra - planar emission . for each radio map",
    ", we generate the corresponding model map with and without the halo component , and compare the axial ratios of the resulting models evaluated at the faintest contour level of the radio map .",
    "radio maps for which the faintest contour fails to distinguish between the presence or absence of the sc model halo component are not used in this analysis .",
    ", width=336 ]    we would like to search for extended halos of the type predicted by the sc model in a way that is not biased by galaxies differing absolute luminosities or the details of planar emission",
    ". we test for these biases based on galaxy luminosity by repeating the axial ratio analysis using two different methods .",
    "the first method uses the absolute surface brightness of the faintest contour in each radio map , and compares the observed axial ratio of that contour to the same absolute contour in the model . since the halo emission extends far from the plane , this method is insensitive to details of emission near the plane , but assumes consistent halo brightness for all galaxies .",
    "the second method scales the contours by the peak surface brightness , comparing the faintest contour in each radio map to the same fractional contour in the model .",
    "this method allows the halo brightness to vary from one galaxy to another , but introduces some potential dependence on the details of peak emission in the plane .",
    "both methods yield similar results ( table 1 ) .",
    "ten of the radio maps have absolute contours comparable to the predicted halo surface brightness ( @xmath10.1 k at 1500 mhz ) and have beam width small compared to the galaxy major axis . allowing the halo temperature to scale with the observed peak surface brightness yields 20 maps with a contour capable of detecting a scaled radio halo .",
    "figure [ axial_hist ] shows the distribution of observed and model axial ratios .",
    "after accounting for the spread in inclination angle , beam smearing , and observing frequency , the sc model predicts axial ratios @xmath12 for the faintest absolute contours and @xmath13 for the faintest fractional contours , consistent with the expected spherical halo component .",
    "the radio data , in contrast , show strongly elliptical contours , with mean axial ratios @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the absolute and fractional contours , respectively .",
    "all of the observed galaxies had an axial ratio larger than the corresponding model prediction .",
    "22 of the 47 radio maps , sampling 13 unique galaxies , had both the sensitivity and angular resolution to test for a bright extended halo of the type predicted by the sc model under one or both comparison methods .",
    "all of the these maps show elongated contours at surface brightness values where a halo should be detectable , while the model consistently predicts rounder contours .",
    "we now consider modifications to the model that would be required to bring the model axial ratio closer to the observed values .",
    "the sc model includes emission from discrete sources , spurs , and radio loops , which we approximate using the galaxy as a template .",
    "similar emission is observed in external galaxies and is largely confined to the plane ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "since this emission does not extend to the @xmath115 kpc scale heights of the sc halo , contours using the absolute surface brightness which can distinguish the presence of a halo are not affected by this component .",
    "relative contours , though , can be affected if the model systematically underestimates the peak surface brightness of the source component in the galaxies , thereby biasing the model relative contours to fainter ( and therefore rounder ) values than the corresponding galaxies . increasing the model axial ratio to the mean value observed in external galaxies",
    "requires increasing the surface brightness of the source component by a factor of five .",
    "alternatively , we can increase the model ellipticity by retaining the nominal surface brightness of the source component , but extending the major axis of this component well beyond that of the diffuse disk component .",
    "in this case , matching the model axial ratio to the radio data requires a source component with linear extent over twice that of the diffuse disk component .",
