    "the orion molecular cloud 1 ( omc-1 ) is a well known region of massive star formation containing several young stellar objects ( ysos ) at the very early stages of their formation as well as outflows related to them ( see , e.g. the review by * ? ? ?",
    "methanol masers in a variety of transitions are often found in such regions .",
    "masing transitions are traditionally divided into two classes .",
    "although masers of both classes often co - exist in the same star - forming region , they are usually seen apart from each other @xcite .",
    "omc-1 harbours strong class  i methanol masers .",
    "these masers are believed to trace distant parts of the outflows from ysos and are associated with the early stages of the massive star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strongest ( about 150 jy ) masers of the j@xmath4j@xmath5  e line series near 25 ghz are observed in omc-1 and have inspired numerous observational and theoretical studies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , strong class ii masers have not been detected in omc-1 . only weak emission in the strongest class",
    "ii @xmath6  a@xmath7 transition at 6.7  ghz has been reported from this source by @xcite , and it was unclear whether the observed spectral line is a maser or has a quasi - thermal origin ( i.e. , the level populations are without inversion ) .",
    "currently , class  ii methanol masers are thought to appear in the vicinity of the massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) at the early stages of ultra - compact hii region ( uchii ) evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the transition at 6.7  ghz manifests flux densities which are the highest among methanol masers and can reach 5000  jy .",
    "maser emission from this transition is widespread and to date has been detected towards more than 500 sources ( see , e.g. the compilation by * ? ? ?",
    "being the strongest this transition is the best prospect for searches for new class ii methanol maser sites .",
    "evolutionary stages of the massive ysos at which different classes of methanol masers exist do intersect considerably .",
    "@xcite detected class  i methanol masers at 95.1  ghz towards 38% of a statistically complete sample of the class  ii masers at 6.7  ghz .",
    "no extensive search of class  ii masers has been performed towards the positions of isolated class  i masers .",
    "this is partly due to the lack of information about such sources since most class  i masers have been found towards known class  ii masers , which are often located within a single dish beam ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , among known sources omc-1 is somewhat exceptional : it posesses strong class  i masers produced by an outflow @xcite , while there are no strong class  ii masers associated with the yso producing this outflow .",
    "recent observations have shown that some hydroxyl masers and class  ii methanol masers can also be associated with outflows @xcite .",
    "this is supported by statistical analysis of correlation between the maser velocities and those of the molecular outflow tracers @xcite and is reasonable because the methanol abundance is significantly increased in the interface regions , where the outflow interacts with the ambient material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is presently unclear whether weak class  ii masers can co - exist with the class  i masers or they always trace different parts of outflow .",
    "we have undertaken a sensitive search at 6.7  ghz in order to figure out whether there are weak class  ii masers in the vicinity of the ysos and outflows in omc-1 .",

    "[ cols=\"<,>,^ , > , > , > \" , ]      according to position listed in the table  [ fit6 ] , the @xmath11.1  km  s@xmath0 feature at 6.7  ghz originates in the orion - south region , which contains a prominent dust and nh@xmath8 condensation @xcite .",
    "however , the feature is noticeably blue - shifted with respect to the normal spread of velocities for lines tracing this molecular core and no emission in methanol lines has been previously reported in orion - south at this velocity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the source appears to be unresolved ( table  [ fit6 ] ) which implies an angular size less than 5@xmath92 and a brightness temperature greater than about 1400  k. the non - imaging analysis of the visibility data described in  [ result6 ] yields the size less than 26 ( a fit for all data except that from the ew367 array configuration ) , and thus the brightness temperature greater than about 2000  k. this high brightness temperature and peculiar velocity of the feature indicate that the detected line most probably is a maser .",
    "the feature appears to show temporal variability ( see section  [ result6 ] ) , which is another indicator that it is likely a maser and not quasi - thermal .",
    "sensitive observations in the infrared and radiocontinuum @xcite do not show the presence of a compact source at the peak position of the newly detected methanol maser listed in the table  [ fit6 ] .",
    "however , positional uncertainties of our observations do not allow us to rule out the possibility of association with 1.3 cm sources 139 - 409 and 140 - 410 of @xcite .",
    "the nature of these sources is unclear and they may be sources of gyrosynchrotron emission or ionized outflows from low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the methanol maser in orion - south is associated with the outflow .",
    "@xcite detected a co outflow presumably ejected from the cs3/fir4 infrared source .",
    "the cs3 and fir4 positions may actually represent the same object observed in the cs line and 1.3  mm continuum , respectively .",
    "the nominal separation between them is 55 along the outflow axis @xcite .",
    "the receding part of the outflow is a remarkable 120 long jet with a very narrow width ( 8) .",
    "the approaching part of the outflow appears on the other side of cs3/fir4 and has an irregular shape covering the whole orion - south region .",
    "the component is seen at velocities from 0 to 3  km  s@xmath0 and encompasses the methanol maser location .",
    "@xcite argued that this component of the outflow might protrude into the hii region m42 , which could explain its ill - defined appearance .",
    "observations of sio lines tracing dense parts of the outflow display blue wings spanning down to @xmath15  km  s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the position of the methanol maser at @xmath11.1  km  s@xmath0 coincides with the blueshifted sio emission within the uncertainty of the measurement ( table  [ fit6 ] and ziurys et al .",
    "it is therefore possible , that the maser is associated with the approaching part of the outflow from cs3/fir4 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the orion - south region contains several outflows ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) possibly originating from the young stellar objects whose formation was induced by outflow described in @xcite .",
    "observations of h@xmath10o masers @xcite and hh objects @xcite show that outflows in the region are quite rapid and the velocity of the newly detected 6.7-ghz methanol maser line component is well within their velocity spread . at present",
    "it is not possible to associate this methanol maser with any particular outflow or young stellar object .",
    "another weak 6.7-ghz methanol maser probably associated with an outflow has been found towards ngc  2024 ( source fir4 ) by @xcite .",
    "though ngc  2024 is situated rather far from orion - south ( about 4to the north ) it also belongs to the orion complex .",
    "the excitation analysis of @xcite shows that class  ii methanol masers can be situated at considerable distances from the young stellar object if the associated region is affected by an outflow which releases methanol from the icy dust grain mantles and warms up the dust in the maser vicinity .",
    "great enhancement of the methanol abundance at the edges of the outflows is confirmed observationally ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "association of a considerable portion of class  ii methanol masers with outflows is supported by statistics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we are currently unable to reveal whether these weak masers found in the orion complex are pumped via a low temperature mechanism similar to that described in [ pumping ] or by the standard scheme @xcite using the hot dust emission from a nearby source . according to the position listed in table  [ fit6 ] , the @xmath11.1  km  s@xmath0 maser",
    "is associated with the southern tip of the dust condensation in orion - south ( mezger , wink & zylka @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of the dust in this region is rather cold ( t@xmath11  k ) to allow the pumping via the standard scheme @xcite .",
    "however , condensations with significantly enhanced dust temperatures ( @xmath2200  k ) do exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . due to the lack of the dust temperature maps at high spatial resolution , it is impossible to discriminate between the pumping regimes on the basis of the dust temperature .",
    "we detected no 25-ghz emission towards the position of the 6.7-ghz maser in orion - south .",
    "therefore , if the low temperature mechanism is realized , the parameters are unlikely the same as used in [ pumping ] .",
    "sensitive observations of the other methanol and hydroxyl maser transitions toward 6.7-ghz maser positions in orion - south and ngc  2024 may elucidate physical status of these sources .",
    "two 6.7-ghz methanol emission features have been detected towards omc-1 , one narrow feature with a peak at @xmath11.1  km  s@xmath0 and a broad feature with a peak at 7.2  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the 7.2  km  s@xmath0 feature consists of at least 2 components which are close in both position and velocity .",
    "these components are likely to be associated with the outflow traced by the 25-ghz masers and 95-ghz emission .",
    "3 .   there is a pumping regime which produces a weak 6.7-ghz maser ( class  ii ) simultaneously with the 25-ghz masers ( class  i ) for relatively low dust temperatures ( @xmath12  k ) .",
    "the pumping occurs through the levels of the first torsionally excited state and is due to the emission of dust intermixed with gas .",
    "brightness temperatures of the order of @xmath13  k can be achieved for such masers .",
    "the @xmath11.1  km  s@xmath0 feature is most probably a maser with a brightness temperature @xmath31400  k. it originates in the orion - south region and may be associated with the approaching part of the outflow seen in co. this feature is most probably variable .",
    "no @xmath14  e 25-ghz emission has been detected towards the orion - south region at velocities near @xmath11  km  s@xmath0 .",
