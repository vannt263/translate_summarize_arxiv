    "the relativistic mean field theory ( rmft ) @xcite , which is essentialy a hartree - fock like method based on the dirac equation for nucleons and the klein - gordon equation for the : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 mesons and photons , reproduces well the nuclear properties when its parameters ( i.e. : masses of nucleons : @xmath3 , mesons : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and their coupling constants @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) are fitted to the largest possible amount of nuclear data . usually the masses and mean square radii of 8 magic nuclei were used to find the rmft parameters and several sets were established for various regions and quantities as : masses , barriers or radii .",
    "we have chequed the quality of three sets : nl1 @xcite , nl2 @xcite , nl3 @xcite by comparing their macroscopic energies obtained by subtracting the strutinsky shell correction , from the rmft binding energies evaluated without pairing forces @xcite with the lublin - strasbourg - drop ( lsd ) energy @xcite .",
    "the minimization of the root mean square of the differences of macroscopic energy allowed to find the new set of rmft parameters nl4 , which even if rather close to the nl3 , as can be seen on the table below , results in a rms deviation that is more than 2 times better ( 7.17 mev and 3.29 mev respectively ) .

    "3 the derivation of the theoretical and experimental masses obtained with the rmft for the nl3 and nl4 parameter sets of are compared with the gogny d1s @xcite hartree - fock - bogolubov ( hfb ) results .",
    "as one can see the nl4 masses are closer to the experimental data than nl3 ones , though they do nt reach the high quality of the d1s gogny force .",
    "the discrepancies in fig .",
    "3 are caused by the approximate treating of the pairing force . in rmft model",
    "it is added by a bcs procedure with the experimental pairing gaps as an input , while the hfb method includes pairing correlations in the selfconsistent mean field .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from our calculation :    * we have shawn that the new rmft nl4 parameters set reproduces the data of spherical , even - even nuclei better than the previous ones like the d1s gogny force . *",
    "the isospin dependent formulae for radii in rmft nl4 are closer to the adjusted to experimental data ones than for other rmft forces .",
