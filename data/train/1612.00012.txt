    "@xcite , applequist and politzer interpreted heavy quark bound states as positronium - like atoms subject to non - relativistic quantum mechanics calculations .",
    "the spectroscopy of quarkonia can then be well understood by solving schrdinger s equation based on the static potential between two heavy quarks  @xcite mediated by the asymptotically - free quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) interactions .",
    "ever since , two - body heavy quark systems have been used to understand the long distance behavior of qcd .",
    "multi - quark states were first proposed in 1964 by gell - mann as an explanation for the observed spectrum of mesons and baryons  @xcite .",
    "this now universally - accepted picture of mesons ( baryons ) as two- ( three-)quark states has been hugely successful , and suggests that the mass of ordinary matter can be explained by the binding energy between quarks .",
    "more recently , enormous progress has been made both theoretically and experimentally in our understanding of four - quark states containing at least one light quark  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , four - quark states containing only heavy quarks have not been directly confirmed by experimental searches . with new data from cms , atlas , and lhcb at the lhc",
    ", a multi - quark state containing only bottom and/or charm quarks is very likely to be tested . from the theoretical side ,",
    "such heavy quark states provide a unique environment to examine the non - relativistic qcd effective potential of many - body systems . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on a potential tetraquark state comprised of two @xmath5 and two @xmath6 quarks .    in qed , the equivalent system is the di - positronium molecule ( ps@xmath7 ) , first postulated by wheeler in 1946  @xcite . using the variational method , the binding energy against dissociation into two positronium atoms",
    "is calculated to be 0.435 ev  @xcite , which is around 3.2% of the binding energy of two positronium atoms .",
    "however , it was nt until 2007 that the use of positron traps and accumulators led to the experimental confirmation of the ps@xmath7 molecular state  @xcite . for the neutral positronium atoms ,",
    "the electric dipole - dipole interaction can be used to generate the splitting between the ground and excited states .",
    "after the standard quantum mechanical perturbative calculation , the additional binding energy can be interpreted in terms of the @xmath8 london - van der waals force  @xcite .    for qcd , there is no equivalent chromo - electric dipole interaction for a color - neutral meson , but one still has the transition - dipole interaction from color - neutral state to color - octet state . depending on the relation between the inter - meson distance and intra - meson binding energy , second - order",
    "perturbative calculations reveal a similar @xmath8 london - van der waals force  @xcite or an @xmath9 casimir - polder force  @xcite . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the van der waals force arises at leading order in @xmath10 and depends only on the geometric ratio of inter - meson and intra - meson binding energies . in the heavy quark limit where the qcd effective",
    "potential is coulomb - like , one can use the van der waals force to calculate the additional inter - meson binding energy and obtain a ratio of @xmath11 of the total intra - meson binding energy , similar to the ps@xmath7 case . for bottom quarks with finite mass , one should also include a long - range linear contribution to the potential  @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed in the literature to calculate the energies of tetraquark systems comprised of purely heavy quarks .",
    "one could , for example , rely on the qcd sum rule method as in ref .",
    "however , the small separation between quarks in the four-@xmath5 system requires the use of higher - derivative moments to reliably estimate the non - perturbative bound state physics , which in turn calls into question the convergence of the perturbative expansion for such moments . even for the two-@xmath5 system",
    ", this approach can become less trustable than the similar charmonium calculations  @xcite .",
    "a separate approach is to treat the @xmath12 system as a composite diquark bound state and then calculate the inter - diquark binding energy  @xcite .",
    "however , this simplified approach turns out to be inadequate as the average distance between the two diquarks is comparable to the separation between their constituent quarks , necessitating a complete four - body calculation .    in this paper ,",
    "we adopt a phenomenological potential with its parameters determined by fitting to the two - body @xmath13 spectrum and verified by lattice simulation .",
    "we then numerically solve the schrdinger equation to obtain the ground state energy and approximate wave function for the four-@xmath5 tetraquark .",
    "after that , we discuss spin - dependent ( sd ) corrections and obtain a final estimate for the ground state mass .",
    "for a two - body @xmath14 system , the cornell potential @xmath15 has been widely used to understand bottomonia and charmonia spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 coulomb term is understood simply as the spin - independent contribution from one - gluon exchange .",
    "the @xmath17 linear term is the long - range contribution due to qcd confinement .",
    "when one extends this phenomenological potential to many - body system , all flux - tube configurations must be checked to minimize the static potential . for three - body systems like baryons , lattice qcd calculations",
    "predict that only two flux - tube configurations matter ; which one to choose depends on whether an interior angle of the triangle formed by the three quarks is greater than 120@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "for the four - body system there are in general three relevant configurations , with the flux - tubes reconfiguring in such a way as to minimize the total potential .",
    "the first two configurations , which in combination is sometimes referred to as the `` flip - flop '' configuration , is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flip - flop - butterfly ] . depending on the relative distance between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "one has the di - meson configuration of either @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "the third , so - called `` butterfly '' configuration , is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flip - flop - butterfly ] .",
    "this is the diquark - diquark configuration with two bottom quarks , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , forming a color - anti - triplet ( or less - favored sextet ) , and the two anti - bottom quarks , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , forming a color - triplet . for the butterfly configuration",
    ", the middle two connecting points should be chosen to minimize the total flux - tube length .",
    "the effective potential for the di - meson system is either v^di - meson_(13 , 24 ) = - ( + ) + ( r_13 + r_24 ) or @xmath27 , which differs only by exchanging @xmath28 .",
    "the flip - flop potential is defined as the minimum of the two di - meson configurations for any four - particle phase space and is given by v^flip - flop .",
    "the effective potential for the butterfly configuration is v^butterfly & = & - ( + + + ) + & & - ( + ) + l_min . here",
    ", @xmath29 is the minimum value of the total flux - tube length for all possible connecting points in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : flip - flop - butterfly ] .",
    "the formula for the sextet diquark configuration is obtained by replacing the coefficients @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "as the sextet configuration has both attractive and repulsive coulomb forces , it generically leads to a larger potential energy and thus will not contribute to the ground state energy calculation .",
    "the total four - quark potential is defined to be the minimum of the three possible configurations and is given by v^4q ( v^flip - flop , v^butterfly ) .",
    "there is no a priori reason to expect that the two potential parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath32 , should have the same values for four - quark states as in two - quark states .",
    "fortunately , the lattice qcd studies of ref .",
    "@xcite find consistency in this approach for a large set of four - quark spatial configurations .",
    "therefore , we will use fitted values of @xmath10 and @xmath32 from the two - body quarkonia spectrum to calculate the solution to the four - body schrdinger equation and obtain the ground state energy .",
    "there are a plethora of ways to calculate the energy levels of many - body non - relativistic systems . for the four - lepton di - positronium molecule ,",
    "variational methods with a very large amount of trial functions have been used to accurately obtain the ground state energy  @xcite . minimizing the hamiltonian for so many variational parameters , however ,",
    "can be extremely computationally expensive ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent attempt ) . for our numerical calculation",
    ", we will instead adopt the more efficient but perhaps less accurate diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an introduction ) . to test the numerical calculation , we successfully reproduced the binding energy for the di - positronium molecule .    the central idea behind",
    "the dmc method is to replace real time by an imaginary time and adjust the guessed ground state energy based on the behavior of the wave function .",
    "the time - dependent wave function evolves as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the true energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "scaling the energy eigenvalues @xmath34 by a constant guessed value @xmath36 makes no physical change to wave function .",
    "thus , after making the substitutions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the evolution of the wave function becomes @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath40 , only the ground state wave function will be stable while the excited states will diffuse away . if @xmath41 , the wave function will diverge , while for @xmath42 even the ground state will diffuse away . by adjusting the value of @xmath36 based on the behavior of the wave function , we are able to obtain the correct ground state energy .    practically , the wave function in the dmc algorithm is represented by random walks of many particles in phase space . to observe the behavior of the wave function with respect to @xmath36 , a `` birth - death '' mechanism",
    "is implemented such that when @xmath36 is too large , the particles will replicate themselves to increase the total number of particles , and vise versa .",
    "for each step , the algorithm adjusts @xmath36 based on the change in the total number of particles until it converges to the ground state energy @xmath43 .",
    "the stabilized walker distribution then gives us the ground state wave function .",
    "for the system at hand , we also need to find @xmath29 for the butterfly configuration .",
    "this is similar to the well - known fermat and torricelli problem to link three points with a minimal network , which is a special case of the steiner tree problem in mathematics .",
    "the added connecting points in the middle are known as steiner points , and the original points are called terminals . in two - dimensional space",
    ", the steiner tree problem has an analytical solution , however it is still an np - complete problem in higher dimensions . to find the positions of the two steiner points the steiner configuration for the two vertices in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flip - flop - butterfly ] , we adopt smith s algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this iterative algorithm determines an equation for each steiner point , @xmath44 , from summing all possible links surrounding it to both terminals and other steiner points : @xmath45 . here , @xmath46 is the position of point @xmath47 after the @xmath48-th iteration .",
    "usually after only 20 iterations this algorithm gives a solution that matches the true solution to a very high precision .",
    "to calculate the tetraquark mass , we will adopt two sets of benchmark parameters for @xmath49 , @xmath10 and @xmath32 & & : m_b = 4.79  , _ s = 0.38 , a = 2.43  ^-1 , + & & : m_b = 5.17  , _ s = 0.36 , a = 2.34  ^-1 . [ eq : benchmark ] both of them can provide a good fit to the bottomonium spectra  @xcite , although the second one requires a universal shift of energy levels of around @xmath50  gev , to take into account that the dynamic bottom - quark mass could be different from the bare heavy quark mass .",
    "to check the stability of our numerical calculation , we fix the dmc parameters  initial particle number , time step , and simulation length  and modify the total potential by an overall factor of @xmath51 .",
    "this is equivalent to scaling the reduced mass and ground state energy while keeping numerical running conditions fixed . in dimensionless units ,",
    "the binding energy is anticipated to scale as @xmath52 , which is clear from fig .  [",
    "fig : cornell - delta - ratio ] .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of additional binding energy , @xmath53 , over the di - meson binding energy , @xmath43 , for the flip - flop and flip - flop+butterfly potentials should be independent of @xmath51 , which is also approximately true up to small numerical fluctuations . from the lower panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : cornell - delta - ratio ] , it is clear that the flip - flop and flip - flop+butterfly configurations account for an additional 20% and 30% binding energy , respectively .",
    ".the additional binding energy for the two benchmark points . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : energy - level ] , we show the additional binding energy due to the different four - particle effective potential configurations . within the error of our calculation",
    ", we have found that an additional @xmath54  mev and @xmath55  mev of binding energy can be attributed to the flip - flop or flip - flop+butterfly configurations .",
    "the total binding energy for the flip - flop+butterfly configuration is around 330  mev for bm - i and 300  mev for bm - ii ( without accounting for the constant energy shift of @xmath56  gev ) .",
    "these binding energies are large enough to suggest that the four @xmath5 state should be treated as a true tetraquark system rather than a weakly - coupled molecular system .     for different static potential and for the benchmark fit point",
    "- i in eq .",
    "( [ eq : benchmark ] ) . ]",
    "before we move on to discuss the spin - dependent corrections , we show the wave functions for the tetra - quark state . to generate the wave functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave - r2psi2 ] and simplify the multiple - dimension numerical integration , we have treated the wave - function as approximately flat in @xmath57 and @xmath58 and kept the remaining three variables : @xmath59 , @xmath60 and a relative angle between them . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : wave - r2psi2 ] , we show the squared wave function times @xmath61 for different static potentials , while in the lower panel we show the value of the squared wave function near the origin .",
    "one can see that the squared wave function for the flip - flop+butterfly potential is around 0.59 of the value for dissociated di - meson configuration at the origin .",
    "there is only around 5% difference between the flip - flop and flip - flop+butterfly squared wave functions .",
    "we also note that because of the symmetries @xmath28 and @xmath62 , the wave functions are identical when plotted in terms of @xmath60 , @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "for a two particle system , short - range spin - dependent interactions contain a local @xmath65-function force  @xcite h_sd c_2_s _ 1 _ 2 4(r_12 ) , [ eq : sd - general ] with @xmath66 as the difference of quadratic casimir .",
    "for the four particle system , we anticipate the ground state spatial wave function to be predominantly @xmath67-wave so additional corrections proportional to @xmath68 should be negligible . from fig .",
    "[ fig : wave - r2psi2 ] , it is apparent that the wave function for the flip - flop configuration closely approximates the wave function for the flip - flop+butterfly configuration .",
    "thus , to implement the sd correction for the @xmath1 tetraquark , we will focus on the flip - flop configuration .",
    "the general ground state wave function for the flip - flop di - meson configuration is    = \\ {    ll ( r_13)(r_24)|(b_1 |b_3)_1 ( b_2 |b_4)_1 ^(0,0)_13 , 24 & r_1 , + ( r_14)(r_23)|(b_1 |b_4)_1 ( b_2 |b_3)_1 ^(0,0)_14 , 23 & r_2 .    here , @xmath69 represents the region with @xmath70 and otherwise for @xmath71 ; @xmath72 represents the color - singlet contraction of @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "the product of the spatial and color wave functions is symmetric under the interchange of @xmath62 and @xmath28 , so the spin - zero wave functions should be ^(0,0)_13 , 24 & = & ( b_1^b_3 ^ - b_1^b_3^)(b_2^b_4 ^ - b_2^b_4^ ) , + ^(0,0)_14 , 23 & = & -(b_1^b_4 ^ - b_1^b_4^)(b_2^b_3 ^ - b_2^b_3^ ) .",
    "the relative minus between the above two terms is necessary to satisfy the pauli exclusion principle , and provides the lowest ground state energy after hyperfine splitting .",
    "calculating the matrix element @xmath73 , the spin - dependent correction for the @xmath1 ground state is approximately e_sd & = & - + & & -14530   , for bm - i with @xmath74 .",
    "the result for bm - ii is similar .",
    "the symmetries @xmath62 and @xmath28 imply that the contributions of @xmath69 and @xmath71 to the matrix element are the same , and thus we double the expression for region @xmath69 in our calculation . here",
    ", the relative error is taken to be @xmath75  @xcite and should only be used as guidance from the theoretical calculation .",
    "altogether , the energy for the ground state @xmath1 mode is m(0^++ ) = 18.690.03   , which is below the energy threshold of @xmath76  gev and @xmath77 = 18.920 $ ]  gev .",
    "for the di - positronium molecule , the leading decay channel comes from @xmath78 annihilation , giving @xmath79  @xcite .",

    "it can also decay into one on - shell and one off - shell @xmath82 via spin rearrangement  @xcite , providing a possible four - lepton final state resonance : @xmath83 with @xmath84 as @xmath85 .    within the framework of our calculation",
    ", one could also calculate heavier states including spin - one and spin - two excitations .",
    "the detailed mass spectrum requires one to calculate the spatial excitation energy as well as the full wave - functions in terms of all degrees of freedom .",
    "these are conceptually straightforward , but numerically complicated .",
    "furthermore , one could also apply our calculation procedure to other four - heavy quark system like @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "for instance , the ground state , @xmath1 , of @xmath86 is estimated to be below twice of @xmath88 mass and can have the similar decay of @xmath89 , which has a smaller branching ratio and different @xmath90 for the experimental searches .    in summary , based on the static potential of the flux - tube model for four heavy quark interactions ,",
    "we have used a diffusion monte carlo algorithm to numerically solve the many - body non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "we have found a ground state , @xmath1 , with a mass of @xmath91  gev , which is approximately 100 mev below twice the mass of @xmath3 expected for a disassociated di - meson ground state . here , the error of 30 mev is chosen to include potentially next - to - leading order sd corrections and should not be taken too seriously .",
