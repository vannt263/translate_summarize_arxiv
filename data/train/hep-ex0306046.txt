    "<S> the 1992 - 1995 running of the fermilab tevatron ( the so - called run  i ) ended with many important physics goals accomplished , including the discovery of the top quark , and the anticipation of many further questions to be answered in the future . </S>",
    "<S> after many upgrades to the detector and to the accelerator complex , run  ii began in april 2001 . </S>",
    "<S> first results obtained by the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration from the analysis of early tevatron run  ii data are reported here . </S>",
    "<S> they fall in two categories : a number of measurements have been performed with the primary goal of establishing detector performance and physics potential . </S>",
    "<S> another set of measurements make use of completely new capabilities of the upgraded detector , thus allowing for competitive results with a modest amount of integrated luminosity . </S>"
