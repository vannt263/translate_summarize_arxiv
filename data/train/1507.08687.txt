    "structures of stellar atmospheres have been traditionally modeled as a function of depth assuming static and horizontally homogeneous stratification ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "real stellar atmospheres should , however , have three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamic structures .",
    "recent efforts for developing 3d hydrodynamic models of stellar atmospheres have been predicting the effects on the wavelength dependence of the limb darkening and wavelength shift of absorption features that are able to be examined for the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the 3d effects on the structure of stellar atmospheres are expected to be much larger in metal - poor stars than objects with the solar metallicity .",
    "a large impact is expected on the surface layers , in which the temperature predicted by the 3d models is significantly lower than that by 1d models .",
    "this is due to the strong adiabatic cooling in 3d models , which is mostly compensated by the line blanketing by numerous spectral lines in metal - rich stars @xcite . the average temperature of the surface layer of 3d models for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath6 is predicted to be about 1000  k lower than than that of corresponding 1d models .",
    "= @xmath7 , and @xmath8 for elements a and b. ] since metal - poor stars are not spatially resolved in general , and the absolute radial velocity is not determined as for the sun , the 3d effects can not be examined by the limb darkening nor the line shift .",
    "the effect of the cool surface layer is , however , expected to appear in absorption features in atomic and molecular lines .",
    "since molecule formation is promoted in cool layers , molecular lines become stronger in general in the calculations using 3d model atmospheres . in other words , chemical abundances derived from molecular lines ( e.g. ,",
    "the carbon abundance derived from ch molecular lines ) using 3d model atmosphere is significantly lower than that derived using 1d models .",
    "a similar trend is expected for fe lines . whereas the ionized fe lines are not sensitive to the 3d effects , the fe abundance derived from its neutral species using an 1d model",
    "could be significantly overestimated @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effect is dependent on the excitation potential of absorption lines , i.e. , lines with smaller excitation potential are formed in cool surface layers that appear in 3d models .",
    "if atmospheres of metal - poor stars have cool layers in reality as predicted by 3d models , a significant dependence of the derived abundances from individual lines on excitation potential is expected in the results obtained by 1d models .",
    "this can be an excellent examination for the 3d effects @xcite .",
    "quantitative estimates of this effect from 3d models were made by @xcite for fe lines and by @xcite for ch , nh , and oh molecular features .",

    "the oxygen abundances derived from these four lines are as high as the value obtained from stronger lines ( @xmath32(o ) @xmath33 ) , supporting our interpretation that the apparent correlation between the oxygen abundances and the strengths of oh lines is due to the dependence of the derived abundances on the excitation potentials of the oh lines .",

    "we note for completeness that , although a weak correlation is found between the derived abundances and wavelengths of the lines ( fig .",

    "5b , c ) .    in the panels d and e of figure  [ fig : ch ] ,",
    "no clear correlation between the derived carbon abundances and wavelengths of ch lines , nor line strengths , is found . this would be due to the fact that the correlation between the wavelength and excitation potentials of ch lines is not as clear as of oh lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ch]f ) .",
    "our 1d - lte abundance analysis for oh and ch molecular lines for the extremely metal - poor star bd+44@xmath0493 demonstrates that the derived oxygen and carbon abundances are dependent on the excitation potential with slopes of @xmath40 ( dex / ev ) .",
    "this suggests that the spectral lines with smaller excitation potentials are enhanced by the existence of a cool layer in the atmosphere that is not reproduced by the current 1d models .",
    "3d atmosphere models predict that the upper layer of photosphere is significantly cooler than that of the 1d models .",
    "@xcite report the correction of oxygen and carbon abundances measured from oh and ch molecular lines using 3d model atmospheres as a function of excitation potentials .",

    "@xcite also investigated line formation for molecules including oh and ch based on the 3d model atmospheres for red giants with @xmath11@xmath45 5000  k. their models for [ fe / h]@xmath46 also predict similar trends of 3d corrections , as a function of excitation potentials , for these molecules that are similar to those of @xcite .",
    "more quantitatively , the correction for ch lines with @xmath47 shown in figure 9 of @xcite is smaller than those of @xcite",
    ". this difference might be partially due to the difference of the effective temperature and metallicity studied by the two works .",
    "the shallower slope found for ch than for oh in our result supports the prediction by @xcite .      a similar dependence of the derived abundances on excitation potentials of spectral lines is also expected for fe lines .",
    "@xcite estimate that the correction reaches @xmath48  dex for low excitation lines of , and the slope @xmath34 could be about @xmath3 dex / ev for very metal - poor stars .",
    "such a clear trend is , however , not found in our previous measurements of fe lines ( figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "a weaker trend , @xmath49 dex / ev , is found in the derived fe abundances from lines .",
    "this trend , however , almost disappears if a slightly low @xmath11 is adopted in the analysis @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows the fe abundances derived from individual lines as functions of excitation potentials and equivalent widths .",
    "large scatter is found in fe abundances derived from lines with small excitation potentials shown by filled and open circles in the figure .",
    "abundances from these lines show some dependence on line strengths : results from lines with equivalent widths larger than 80  m exhibit lower abundances .",
    "such trends suggest that spectral line formation is not well described by 1d lte models .",
    "the recent study by @xcite predicts smaller corrections for fe abundances derived from lines than that of @xcite : their corrections are smaller than 0.2  dex for lines with @xmath50  ev . the correction for fe abundances from lines with @xmath51  ev is , however , predicted to be still as large as 0.6  dex .",
    "the abundances derived from lines with @xmath47 ev for bd+44@xmath0493 show scatter as large as 0.4  dex @xcite .",
    "the large scatter of abundances from low excitation lines might indicate that these lines are particularly affected by the 3d effect .",
    "these lines could also be affected by nlte effects .",
    "@xcite conducted nlte analyses for fe lines of metal - poor stars using the spatial and temporal average stratification from 3d hydrodynamic models , as well as 1d static model atmospheres .",
    "they demonstrated for the cases of metal - poor stars like the subgiant hd  140283 that the analysis with the mean 3d models obtains lower fe abundances on average , with smaller scatter of fe abundances from individual lines , than those obtained from 1d models . on the other hand",
    ", the nlte analysis using the 3d models derives higher fe abundances than those obtained by a lte analysis .",
    "if similar effects are working in the subgiant with lower metallicity like bd+44@xmath0493 , the averaged fe abundances derived by the 1d lte analysis is not significantly corrected by the 3d nlte analysis , whereas the scatter found in abundances from individual lines with small excitation potentials becomes smaller .",
    "we note that the fe abundance obtained from lines by our analysis agrees well with that from lines even if we adopt the gravity ( @xmath52 ) estimated adopting the parallax of this star to be 4.88  mas that is independent of the spectroscopic analysis of fe lines @xcite .",
    "the nlte and 3d effects estimated for lines are much smaller than those for neutral lines in general @xcite .",
    "the agreement of fe abundances obtained from lines of the two ionization stages using the 1d model suggests that the corrections by 3d nlte analysis for lines is not as large as those estimated by 3d lte models .",
    "the carbon and oxygen abundances of bd+44@xmath0493 derived from the lines with relatively large excitation potentials ( @xmath53 ) are @xmath32(c)=5.8 and @xmath54(o)=6.3 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ch ] and [ fig : oh ] ) . adopting the solar abundances @xmath54(c)@xmath55=8.43 and @xmath32(o)@xmath55=8.69 @xcite as well as [ fe / h]@xmath1 for bd+44@xmath0493 , the abundance ratios are [ c / fe]@xmath56 and [ o / fe]@xmath57 .",
    "the difference of oxygen abundances obtained from oh lines with @xmath58 ( ev ) by 3d and 1d model atmospheres ( @xmath59 ) is approximately @xmath60  dex ( fig .",
    "9 of * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the @xmath61 of carbon abundances from ch lines with @xmath62 and 1.0 ( ev ) are @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath63  dex .",
    "including these corrections , [ c / fe ] and [ o / fe ] of bd+44@xmath0493 are about 1.0  dex , indicating that carbon and oxygen are clearly enhanced in this object .",
    "we note that the c / o ratio obtained from ch and oh molecular lines estimated by 1d model atmospheres is robust .",
    "the carbon abundance of bd+44@xmath0493 is measured using the lines at 1.0681.069  @xmath64 m by an nlte analysis based on a 1d model atmosphere by @xcite , obtaining @xmath32(c)@xmath65 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the carbon abundance obtained from ch lines with 1d models , but agrees well with the value corrected for the 3d effects ( see above ) .",
    "@xcite mentioned , however , that the derived carbon abundance from the lines is sensitive to the treatment of nlte effects .",
    "hence , we can not conclude that the estimate of the 3d effects for the carbon abundances from ch lines are quantitatively correct from the comparison with the carbon abundance from the lines .",
    "however , the agreement of the abundances within 0.10.2  dex from ch and lines is supportive for the reliable estimates of carbon abundance of this object .",
    "bd+44@xmath0493 is an extremely metal - poor subgiant with excesses of carbon and oxygen .",
    "oxygen and carbon abundances derived from individual oh and ch lines by our analysis based on 1d lte model atmospheres are dependent on the excitation potentials .",
    "this result might indicate existence of cool layer in the atmosphere which is not described by 1d models .",
    "indeed , the dependence found for oxygen and carbon abundances on excitation potentials , @xmath66 dex / ev , is explained by the corrections estimated from 3d models .    while the behavior of fe absorption lines is complicated , our analysis of oh and ch molecular lines qualitatively supports the prediction of the 3d models on the temperature structure of the surface atmosphere . for more quantitative discussion ,",

    "<S> molecular absorption lines of oh ( 99 lines ) and ch ( 105 lines ) are measured for the carbon - enhanced metal - poor star bd+44@xmath0493 with [ fe / h]@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances of oxygen and carbon determined from individual lines based on an 1d - lte analysis exhibit significant dependence on excitation potentials of the lines ; @xmath2@xmath3 dex / ev , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are elemental abundances from individual spectral lines and their excitation potentials , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence is not explained by the uncertainties of stellar parameters , but suggests that the atmosphere of this object possesses a cool layer that is not reproduced by the 1d model atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> this result agrees with the predictions by 3d model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> although absorption lines of neutral iron exhibit similar trend , it is much weaker than found in molecular lines and that predicted by 3d lte models . </S>"
