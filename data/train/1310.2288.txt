    "the main focus of the paper is to describe @xmath4 the @xmath5-th iteration of the transition operator , e.g. @xmath6 the continuous counterpart of @xmath1 is a riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type . there @xmath7 the kernel of the heat semigroup @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the laplace  beltrami operator , is well understood .",
    "initial results based on specific computations were established by sawyer @xcite and anker @xcite . eventually , anker and ji in @xcite proved a sharp estimates on the kernel @xmath10 whenever @xmath11 is smaller than some constant multiplicity of @xmath12 .",
    "global estimates were subsequently found by anker and ostellari @xcite .",

    "the group - theoretic part of the program has already been carried out by guivarch and rmy in @xcite . moreover , among the open problems in @xcite , the asymptotic behaviour of the green function of finite range isotropic random walks on affine buildings is formulated .    in the present paper",
    "we provide the answer for the posed question .",
    "we give a detailed description of the off - diagonal behaviour of @xmath4 on any affine building of reduced type .",
    "the case @xmath14 will be covered in @xcite .",
    "we show sharp lower and upper estimates on @xmath0 ( see theorem [ th:4 ] ) uniform in the region @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the convex envelope of the support of @xmath19 . the definition of @xmath20 may be found in subsection [ subsec:4.3 ] .",

    "random walks on affine buildings have already been studied for over thirty years . in 1978",
    "sawyer @xcite obtained the asymptotic of @xmath42 for homogeneous trees , i.e. affine buildings of type @xmath43 .",
    "the result was extended to @xmath44 by tolli @xcite , lindlbauer and voit @xcite and cartwright and woess @xcite .",
    "eventually , local limit theorem for all affine buildings was proved by parkinson @xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal behaviour of @xmath4 was studied only in two cases . for homogeneous trees the uniform asymptotic",
    "were obtained by lalley @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that lalley considered more general random walks , e.g. not necessarily radial . for affine buildings of higher rank",
    "the first results were obtained by anker , schapira and the author in @xcite where for each building of type @xmath45 the distinguished averaging operator was studied .",
    "the main tool used in the study of isotropic random walks is the spherical fourier transform . in 1970s",
    "macdonald @xcite developed the spherical harmonic analysis for groups of @xmath13-adic type .",
    "however , not every affine building corresponds to a group of @xmath13-adic type .",
    "later , cartwright and @xcite proposed a construction of spherical fourier transform using geometric and combinatorial properties of buildings of type @xmath46 .",
    "the approach was extended by cartwright @xcite to buildings of type @xmath44 and by parkinson @xcite to all affine buildings .",
    "the result of the paper is theorem [ th:4 ] .",
    "let us give an outline of its proof : the application of spherical fourier transform results in an oscillatory integral which is analysed by the steepest descent method .",
    "thanks to some geometric properties of the support of spherical fourier transform of @xmath47 the integral can be localized .",
    "therefore , the proof amounts to finding the asymptotic of @xmath48 uniformly with respect to @xmath49 as @xmath5 approaches infinity .",
    "if @xmath50 lies on the wall of the weyl chamber @xmath51 , functions @xmath52 retain symmetries in the directions orthogonal to the wall .",
    "close to the wall we take advantage of this by expanding @xmath53 into its taylor series and using combinatorial methods we identify remaining cancellations .    in @xcite , for each affine building of type @xmath44 , a particular nearest neighbour random walk was studied .",
    "its spherical fourier transform satisfies the key combinatorial formula that allows to avoid the analysis of cancellations ( similar phenomena occurs in @xcite ) .",
    "in section [ sec:2 ] we present the definition and some estimates for the function @xmath37 which appears later on in the estimates for @xmath4 .",
    "next , we show two auxiliary lemmas : one analytic and one combinatorial .",
    "the later has applications beyond the subject of the paper . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we demonstrate the general method where we derive the optimal upper and lower bounds for a finite range random walk on a grid .",

    "* theorem 2.3.11 ) )  to the author s best knowledge this is a new outcome . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "the definitions of root systems and affine buildings are recalled , and a number of spherical - analytic facts used across the paper are recollected .",
