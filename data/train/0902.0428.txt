    "the simplicity and elusiveness of the full three - body problem have captived mathematicians for centuries . still today ,",
    "because of its non - integrability , the three - body problem remains tricky .",
    "it has been solved for particular cases , by reducing the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the first major results is the determination of families of periodic orbits in the three - body problem under certain assumptions ( see for instance hnon 1976 or hadjidemetriou 1976 ) .    since the first observations of extrasolar systems , the interest of the general three - body problem has been boosted , mainly under the coplanar assumption .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of bodies in mean motion resonances ( mmr ) allowed to study the stability of several two - planet systems ( see e.g. hadjidemetriou 2002 , 2008 or callegari 2004 ) .",
    "the secular behavior of two - planet systems has been investigated as well ( e.g. henrard & libert 2008 ) . because most presently known extrasolar planets move on eccentric orbits , beaug & michtchenko ( 2003 ) investigated the eccentric , coplanar three - body problem to characterize the dynamics of such two - planet systems .",
    "faced to the detection of multi - planetary systems ( one star and 2 planets or more ) , and to the increasing number of degrees of freedom , numerical methods of global analysis have been performed in order to study their dynamical stability . by combining _",
    "n_-body integrators with numerical tools for detection of chaos ( notably fast indicators or frequency analyses ) , the exploration of the _ n_-body planetary problem ( with _ n _",
    "@xmath0 ) is accessible from numerical methods . as a consequence ,",
    "mechanisms generating stability of multi - planetary systems can be identified and explained .",
    "for instance , mechanisms involving a mmr as well as an apsidal synchronous precession ( asp hereafter ) have been intensively studied ( e.g. lee & peale 2002 , 2003 ; bois 2003 , ji 2003 ) . a solution involving both mmr and",
    "asp describes well the stability of eccentric , compact multi - planetary systems , but may not however be unique .",
    "we note , for example , that other multi - planetary systems have been found to be mainly controlled by secular dynamics ( e.g. michtchenko 2006 or ji 2007 ) . in gayon & bois ( 2008a ) , by using a numerical method of global analysis , we found a novel stabilizing mechanism involving a _ retrograde _ mmr in a two - planet system , which means that the two planets are both in mmr and _ revolve in opposite direction_. let us note that the difference between a _",
    "mmr and a _ retrograde _ mmr does not only lie in the retrograde motion of one of the two planets .",
    "the mechanisms of stability related to a retrograde mmr and their underlying properties differ from the prograde case .",
    "such stabilities are generally more robust ( see gayon & bois 2008a , 2008b ) .",
    "the assumption that two giant planets are in a mmr and revolving in opposite directions around their hosting star is apparently contradicting to the most accepted formation theory of planetary systems , notably to the formation and evolution of the resonant planetary systems ( core accretion mechanism combined by a planetary migration scenario ) .",
    "however , in gayon & bois ( 2008a ) , we present two feasible processes leading to planets revolving in opposite directions . the first scenario has been introduced by nagasawa ( 2008 ) and consists in the combination of a planet - planet scattering , a tidal circularization and kozai mechanisms .",
    "starting from a hierarchical 3-planet system and considering a migration mechanism including a process of planet - planet scattering and tidal circularization , the authors show that close - in planets may be formed . in a few cases , due to the kozai mechanim",
    ", one planet enters a retrograde motion . the second feasible process imagined by varvoglis ( private discussions ) and ourselves",
    "is related to the capture of free - floating planets . by integrating the trajectories of planet - sized bodies that encounter a coplanar two - body system ( a sun - like star and a jupiter mass )",
    ", varvoglis finds that the probability of capture is significant , and ,",
    "morever , that the percentage of free - floating planets captured is higher for retrograde motions than for prograde motions . as a consequence , it would be possible to find one day some planetary systems in counter - revolving configuration .    in the case of a two - planet system ,",
    "analytical and numerical methods are complementary .",
    "besides , the acquiring of an analytical `` rail '' contributes to a deeper understanding of the numerical exploration . as a result , the analytical approach permits to study thoroughly the numerical results . by plotting surfaces of sections",
    ", it provides the major structures related to the stability properties . as a consequence , in the present paper",
    ", we propose a hamiltonian expansion based on this novel and feasible stabilizing mechanism introduced in gayon & bois ( 2008a and 2008b ) .",
    "we therefore investigate the three - body problem in the particular case of retrograde resonances , adapting the hamiltonian approach of beaug & michtchenko ( 2003 ) firstly expanded for eccentric , coplanar , and _ prograde _ orbits . from this analytical expansion",
    ", we can correctly derive the expression of resonance angles in the case of a retrograde mmr .",
    "a comparison with the numerical results obtained in gayon & bois ( 2008a ) is also carried out .    in the present paper ,",
    "we firstly introduce the general expressions of the hamiltonian as well as the canonical variables in the case of two massive planets moving around their host star ( section 2 ) .",
    "we note that a dynamical system composed of two satellites orbiting a planet is also an equivalent problem .",
    "all the results shown in the present paper may therefore be applied to satellite systems .",
    "the consideration of planets revolving in opposite directions involves new expressions for canonical variables presented in section 3 .",
    "we adapt the disturbing function of the beaug & michtchenko model to retrograde motions in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we express the hamiltonian for retrograde resonances .",
    "an orbital fit of the hd73526 planetary system involving a 2:1 retrograde mmr was found consistent with the observational data in gayon & bois ( 2008a ) . as a consequence , in section 6 ,",
    "we apply the analytical model to the hd73526 planetary system ruled in such conditions and compare our numerical and analytical results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_surfsec ] , our results obtained by the analytical expansion are visualized by surfaces of section .",
    "we suppose a star of mass @xmath1 and 2 planets of mass @xmath2 and @xmath3 such as@xmath4 and moving around their barycenter . we choose to express the hamiltonian of the system in the heliocentric frame by using the following delaunay variables  :    @xmath5    with @xmath6,@xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 , and @xmath11 the geometrical orbital elements of the planet @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "g is the gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath14 is the reduced mass for the planet @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system ( denoted @xmath15 ) consists of a keplerian part ( @xmath16 ) and a disturbing function ( @xmath17 )  : @xmath18 the leading part of the disturbing function , called the direct part , depends on the instantaneous distance between the two planets ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "owing to the choice of the origin of the coordinate systems , the second part of @xmath17 is called the indirect part of the disturbing function .",
    "@xmath17 depends on the barycentric velocities @xmath20 of each planet , expressed in cartesian coordinates .    to study the 3-body problem ,",
    "different sets of canonical variables can be used , depending on the simplifications carried out for reducing the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , beaug & michtchenko ( 2003 ) applied the so - called modified delaunay variables to solve the coplanar , prograde and eccentric 3-body problem . in the present paper , we define a new set of canonical variables , especially devoted to planets revolving in opposite directions .",
    "in this study , we choose to set a prograde direction of revolution for the inner planet ( noted 1 ) and a retrograde one for the outer planet ( noted 2 ) . from the previous set of delaunay variables ( [ var_delaunay ] ) , we therefore define the two following sets of canonical variables for planets 1 and 2 respectively  : @xmath21 @xmath22 the first set of canonical variables ( [ var_poincare ] ) corresponds to the well - known modified delaunay canonical variables while the second one ( [ var_poincare_retro ] ) is developed for retrograde planetary motion .",
    "@xmath23 is the mean longitude of the planet @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the longitude of periastron is defined by : @xmath24 , for a coplanar and _ prograde _ planetary motion ( which is equivalent to consider @xmath25 ) and by @xmath26 , for a coplanar and _ retrograde _ planetary motion ( equivalent to @xmath27 ) . restricting the study to a coplanar but counter - revolving problem ,",
    "the set of canonical variables of the system can be simplified as follows  : @xmath28",
    "the method used for the expansion of the disturbing function originates from beaug & michtchenko ( 2003 ) .",
    "they expanded an expression for the hamiltonian that is valid for high eccentricities of one or both planets .",
    "their method provides a good assessment of the disturbing function when planets are close to the collision point .",
    "hence , the solution converges in all points of the phase space except for the singularities ( corresponding to planetary collisions ) .",
    "moreover , the rate of convergence does not depend on the values of eccentricities but rather on the order of magnitude of the distribution function itself . besides , depending on the studied planetary system , even for very eccentric orbits , the rate of convergence of the disturbing function may be relatively fast .",
    "classical methods such as laplace 1799 or kaula 1962 were expanded for coplanar and quasi - circular orbits and were useful for studying dynamics of the solar system ( or hierarchical systems in general ) . nonetheless , due to the detection of eccentric exo - planetary systems , new and specific expansions of the disturbing function were needed . as a consequence ,",
    "the beaug & michtchenko method seems much more suitable for such eccentric planetary orbits . to apply this method for counter - revolving configurations , we propose to expand again the disturbing function , by considering the prograde motion of the inner planet and the retrograde motion of the outer planet .",
    "the direct part of the disturbing function that generally encounters problems of convergence may be expressed as a function of the heliocentric radial distances @xmath29 of both planets and the @xmath30 angle between both bodies as seen from the star  : @xmath31 we note that for counter - revolving configurations , the angle @xmath30 between both bodies is defined by angle is defined by : @xmath32 with @xmath33 . ]  : @xmath34 with @xmath35 the true anomaly of the planet @xmath12 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined in ( [ var_poincare ] ) and ( [ var_poincare_retro ] )",
    ". a concise expression of the previous equation is written in ( [ eq_rho ] ) by taking into account the ratio @xmath38 such as  : @xmath39 the key of the beaug & michtchenko ( 2003 ) method lies in the expansion in power series in a new variable noted @xmath40 and corresponding to a measurement of the proximity of the initial condition to the singularity in @xmath41  : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 has a singularity at @xmath45 .",
    "the determination of the coefficients @xmath46 is performed by the way of a linear regression for @xmath40 values greater than @xmath47 , @xmath48 being a positive parameter close to zero .",
    "a good precision of the direct part of the disturbing function may be reached for a good compromise between the @xmath48 value and the choice of @xmath49 order in the series expansion .",
    "contrary to classical methods involving fourier series of the @xmath30 variable or power series in @xmath50 , not only the convergence rate of this method is improved but also the expansion of the disturbing function can be applied for eccentric two - planet systems . more details can be found in beaug & michtchenko ( 2003 ) .    from ( [ eq_r2d ] ) and by using the explicit expression of @xmath40 , we find  : @xmath51 changing from powers of @xmath52 to multiples of @xmath30 and by using the explicit expression of the @xmath30 angle , one obtains  : @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xmath56    the direct part of the disturbing function may be expressed in terms of mean anomaly by using the fourier expansion of the following functions ( e.g. hughes 1981 )  : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the hansen coefficient function of the eccentricity ( kaula 1962 )  : @xmath59 with @xmath60 the newcomb operators , @xmath61 and @xmath62.let us recall that the newcomb operators obey to simple recurrence relations ( brouwer & clemence 1961 ; murray & dermott 1999 ) .    substituting ( [ eq_newcomb ] ) into ( [ eq_hansen ] ) , we obtain  : @xmath63    the direct part of the disturbing function is therefore expressed as follows  : @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .      from ( [ eq_ham ] ) , the indirect part of the disturbing function is given by the function @xmath67  : @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the barycentric velocities of the planet @xmath12 , expressed in cartesian coordinates . in the case of coplanar orbits , the expressions of @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "take into account the direction of motion of the planet @xmath12 .",
    "we define @xmath69 for a prograde motion and a retrograde one as follows . ]  : @xmath72    consequently , considering a coplanar problem and planets revolving in opposite directions , the indirect part is equal to  : @xmath73      \\end{aligned } \\label{eq_t1}\\ ] ]    by using ( [ eq_ra ] ) and considering the prograde motion of planet 1 and the retrograde one of planet 2 , one obtains  : @xmath74    substituting these results into ( [ eq_t1 ] ) , we find  : @xmath75 where @xmath76 are constant coefficients such as  : @xmath77 .",
    "+   + by combining ( [ eq_direct ] ) and ( [ eq_indirect ] ) , we obtain the complete expression of the disturbing function as follows  : @xmath78 where @xmath79 are constant coefficients .",
    "@xmath80 are independent of initial conditions and then require to be determined once .",
    "we are now able to express the angles of resonance in the case of counter - revolving configurations as shown in the following section .",
    "considering planets close to a mmr and revolving in opposite directions , we define the mmr ratio by @xmath81 with @xmath82 _ and _ @xmath83 .",
    "for instance , when two planets revolve in opposite direction and have a period ratio of @xmath84 , the @xmath85 order of resonance is equal to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we set @xmath88 and define the following set of canonical variables in the case of a retrograde mmr  : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the resonant angles while @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the conjugate momenta depending on the eccentricities @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "+ let @xmath96 be the following angle of the disturbing function such as  : @xmath97 .",
    "considering the new set of variables , the expression of @xmath96 becomes  : @xmath98q     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the synodic angle .",
    "hence , the disturbing function depends on three angular variables @xmath100 . considering the new set of canonical variables @xmath101 , we find the following constant of motion  : @xmath102    as a consequence , our system has therefore two integrals of motion : the @xmath15 hamiltonian and @xmath103 .",
    "it is well known that the frequency of the angle @xmath104 is much higher than that of @xmath105 . as a consequence ,",
    "we consider only long period perturbations in the hamiltonian . the system is then averaged with respect to the synodic angle as follows  : @xmath106 the averaging over",
    "the @xmath104 variable written in ( [ eq_q ] ) implies a third constant of motion , namely @xmath107 . as a consequence ,",
    "the system consists of four degrees of freedom and three constants of motion . from now on ,",
    "the system can be reduced to four independent variables , namely @xmath108 and @xmath93 .",
    "taking into account the condition of mmr ( @xmath109 ) , we obtain the final expression of the disturbing function ( [ final_disturb ] ) and the average hamiltonian ( [ final_ham ] ) respectively , for a retrograde resonance  : @xmath110    @xmath111    due to dalembert s properties of the disturbing function , some coefficients are null if one ( or more ) of the following conditions is reached  : 1 ) @xmath112 , 2 ) @xmath113 , 3 ) @xmath114 even ( odd ) number and j odd ( even ) number , 4 ) @xmath115 even ( odd ) number and k odd ( even ) number .",
    "using the final expression of the hamiltonian , the @xmath107 and @xmath116 constants of motion as well as the following set of canonical variables , @xmath117 we can firstly integrate a two - planet system both in counter - revolving configuration and in mmr and secondly , compare the analytical results with numerical ones . using a bulirsch - stoer method , we integrate numerically the following differential equations  : @xmath118    for the integration of ( [ eq_derivatives ] ) , we use our initial conditions for the hd@xmath11973526 system , located very close to the 2:1 retrograde mmr ( i.e. at the edge of a v - shape structure in a stability map in @xmath120 $ ] orbital elements ; see gayon & bois , 2008a )  : @xmath121 @xmath122 such initial conditions ( [ eq_ci ] ) are sufficiently close to the retrograde mmr to apply our analytical expansion .",
