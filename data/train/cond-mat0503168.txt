    "there is a fundamental difference between the kondo effect in quantum dots and the kondo effect in alloys with magnetic impurities . in the latter case",
    "the dressed localized magnetic moment increases the scattering cross section and as a result there is a minimum in the resistivity , whereas for the former case the resistivity depends on the parity of the level occupied by electrons .",
    "however , the physics responsible for these resistances is similar . in both cases",
    "the effect is due to the spin correlated transport at the fermi level .",
    "the kondo effect has been understood in the structure that a quantum dot coupled to the normal electrodes in equilibrium and out of equilibrium@xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of high order perturbation and co - tunnelling process caused by the electron - spin interaction between electrons in the quantum dot and in lead .",
    "the kondo effect through quantum dots coupled to external leads can even induce current in the coulomb blockade regime by making spin correlated singlet and triplet with electron spins outside the quantum dot@xcite .",
    "the conductance is related to the number of electrons in the dot .",
    "usually the kondo effect appears when the dot has odd number of electrons ( total spin 1/2 ) , but is absent when the dot has even number of electrons ( total spin 0 ) .",
    "the conductance or the density of states ( dos ) of the dot is enhanced by the kondo effect at low temperature . however , for the ferromagnetic - quantum dot - ferromagnetic system , the question is open .",

    "the first term in hamiltonian describes the free electron in magnetic electrodes , the second and third terms represent the correlated level of the quantum dot , the fourth term is to describe spin - orbit coupling which may cause the spin rotation of an electron in the quantum dot , and the last term is the spin - dependent hybridization of the quantum dot with the magnetic electrodes .",
