    "the production and characterization of solutions of janus particles , whose spherical surface is divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic hemispheres , have attracted the attention of a number of authors @xcite .",
    "studies of the behavior of these colloidal systems must take into account that janus particles interact in a different way depending on their relative orientations .",
    "a simple form of a pairwise directional potential has been proposed by kern and frenkel @xcite , who introduced a model of hard spheres with the addition of a square - well potential with directional attractive short - range interactions .",
    "the kern - frenkel model has been used in several analytical and numerical investigations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a simplified two - state version of the kern - frenkel model , which is reminiscent of the zwanzig approximation for liquid - crystalline models , and can be experimentally realised by the application of an electric field , has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "these recent calculations provided the motivation to introduce a simple lattice statistical model to analyze the effects of directional interactions in a janus gas of particles .",
    "it is well - known that lattice gas models on the bethe lattice , which is the deep interior of a large cayley tree , lead to the same ( analytic ) equations of state of the quasi - chemical approximation for a simple lattice gas @xcite . in the limit of infinite coordination of the tree",
    ", it has been shown that one regains the usual mean - field solutions @xcite .",
    "we then revisit the lattice gas problem on a cayley tree with the inclusion of directional interactions .",
    "we consider a mixture of janus particles of types @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with hydrophobic ( hydrophilic ) hemispheres in the upper ( lower ) half part of their respective spherical surfaces , which amounts to considering a two - state , ising - like , representation of a janus gas ( see figure [ cayley ] ) . in a grand canonical formulation , we add a chemical potential to control the density of each type of particle .",
    "taking advantage of the geometrical structure of this tree , it becomes particularly simple to introduce directional interactions between first - neighbor sites along the branches of the graph .",
    "we choose the parameters of the potential , and the concentration of the two types of particles , to make contact with the available numerical simulations .    .",
    "the two - state system is formed by janus particles of type @xmath0 ( depicted as circles with red heads up in this figure ) and of type @xmath1 ( blue heads up ) .",
    "the trees on the left ( a ) , and on the right ( b ) , illustrate macroscopic configurations with a high density of @xmath0-particles , and a modulated ( `` striped '' ) phase , respectively .",
    "[ cayley ] ]    this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "i , we describe the lattice statistical model on a cayley tree .",
    "we show that the solutions on the bethe lattice ( deep in the interior of the tree ) can be obtained from the analysis of the recursion relations associated with a nonlinear discrete map . in sections",
    "ii and iii , we analyze some particular cases , and make contact with results from simulations .",
    "in particular , we show that attractive interactions of the kern - frenkel form lead to layered modulated structures , which have indeed been found in the simulations @xcite .",
    "although we do not make quantitative contacts with the simulations , we do claim to have used a much simpler approach to obtain a number of analytical qualitatively results , for a full range of model parameters .",
    "in particular , we provide a unified view of the phase transitions described by a `` cubic diagram '' of interaction parameters drawn by fantoni and collaborators @xcite .",
    "we consider janus particles restricted to two orientations . these particles",
