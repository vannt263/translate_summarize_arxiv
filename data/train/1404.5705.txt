    "the erds - rnyi random graph @xcite is the simplest but probably the most important example of a random graph . in this graph , denoted by @xmath1 each pair of the @xmath2 vertices",
    "is connected with probability @xmath3 independently of other pairs .",
    "the phase transition phenomenon it exhibits has been greatly studied in the past decades .",
    "it has been proved @xcite that for @xmath4 with @xmath5 , the largest component has @xmath6 vertices and the second largest @xmath7 vertices ( as @xmath8 with probability @xmath9 ) ; for @xmath4 with @xmath10 the largest component has @xmath7 vertices ; when @xmath11 , the largest component of @xmath1 has @xmath12 vertices .    in 1997 ,",
    "aldous considered the erds - rnyi random graph inside the  scaling window \" of the phase transition .",
    "he proved in @xcite that the ordered set of the component sizes rescaled by @xmath13 converge to an ordered set of excursion lengths of reflected inhomogeneous brownian motion with a certain drift .",
    "this work received a lot of attention since its publication . a vast variety of random graph models studied in the past decades",
    "have been shown to exhibit a phase transition phenomenon similar to the erds - rnyi random graph .",
    "many of these models have been proved to show same type of behaviour in the near critical regime and some of them have been shown to fall into the different universality class .",
    "one of the models above is a random multigraph with @xmath2 vertices constructed using the configuration model with its vertex degrees being independent identically distributed random variables with the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "joseph in 2011 @xcite showed that the limit of the ordered set of the critical random multigraph component sizes rescaled appropriately depends on the distribution @xmath14 in the following way .",
    "if @xmath14 has finite third moment then the right scaling is @xmath13 and the model falls into the same universality class as the erds - rnyi random graph .",
    "however , if @xmath15 as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 then the scaling is @xmath19 and the limit is an ordered set of the excursion lengths of a certain drifted process with independent increments above past minima .",
    "riordan @xcite proved the same result as finite third moment but extended it to the scaling window .",
    "nachmias and peres in 2007 @xcite among other results proved that random graph obtained by performing percolation on a random @xmath20-regular ( @xmath21 ) graph on @xmath2 vertices with percolation probability @xmath22 , @xmath23 falls into the same universality class as the erds - rnyi random graph .",
    "the near critical behavior of the rank-1 model , which is a special case of the general inhomogeneous random graph studied in @xcite , received much attention in the last years .",
    "this model can be seen as a random graph with vertices having a weight ( @xmath24 of vertex @xmath25 ) associated to them , and the weight of a vertex moderates its degree in a sense that the probability of connection between two vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a positive constant possibly depending on @xmath2 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details . in the rank-1 model in the",
    " critical window \" , the weights @xmath29 are independent identically distributed random variables with finite third moment and the probability of connection is @xmath30 .",
    "this model , formulated , however , differently was first proved by aldous in @xcite to belong to the same universality class as the erds - rnyi random graph .",
    "later , in @xcite and in @xcite independently , similar result was reproved . the rank-1 model with power - law degrees",
    "was considered in @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that for exponent @xmath18 , the sizes of the components rescaled by @xmath19 converge to hitting times of certain lvy process .",
    "note that for @xmath18 the degrees have finite variance but infinite third moment .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the near critical behavior of the so - called quantum random graph .",
    "as it is explained in @xcite both the motivation and the choice of terminology come from the stochastic geometric ( fortuin  kasteleyn type ) representation of the quantum curie - weiss model in transverse magnetic field , which was originally developed in the general ferromagnetic context in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite where the stochastic geometric representations of different types are explained in more detail .",
    "the quantum random graph , as is explained below , was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is a quantum version of the classical erds - rnyi random graph .",
    "more precisely :    [ [ the - model ] ] the model : + + + + + + + + + +    there are two parameters @xmath31 $ ] - the inverse temperature , and @xmath32 - the strength of the transverse field .",
    "the case @xmath33 corresponds to the ground state .",
    "and as it will be explained later the case @xmath34 brings us to the classical erds - rnyi random graphs discussed above .",
    "we shall consider only @xmath35 and @xmath36 case in this work .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the circle of length @xmath38 . the model is built on the space @xmath39 , that is to each site @xmath40 we attach a copy @xmath41 of @xmath37 , where we use @xmath42 .",
    "we shall call the second coordinate of a point in this space - the time coordinate . in each @xmath41 , make finite random number of holes using the poisson point process of holes @xmath43 on @xmath41 with intensity @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath43-s are assumed to be independent for different @xmath25-s .",
    "the punched circle @xmath45 consists of @xmath46 disjoint connected intervals , @xmath47 of course @xmath48 whenever the cardinality @xmath49 .",
    "next , draw finite random number of links between various points of @xmath50 with the same time coordinates , that is between points of the type @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the following way . with each ( unordered ) pair of vertices",
    "@xmath55 we associate a copy @xmath56 of @xmath37 and a poisson point process of links @xmath57 on @xmath56 with intensity @xmath58 .",
    "processes @xmath59 are assumed to be independent for different @xmath60 and also independent of the processes of holes @xmath43 .",
    "two intervals @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the decomposition are said to be connected if there exists @xmath63 such that @xmath64 , whereas @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the decomposition @xmath67 of @xmath68 into maximal connected components is , thereby , well defined .",
    "we used @xmath69 above to denote the total collection of all the holes .",
    "an example for @xmath70 is given in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "for each fixed @xmath71 the probability @xmath72 .",
    "thus , for given @xmath71 the notion @xmath73 of the connected component containing @xmath74 in the above decomposition is well defined .",
    "after all the holes are punched and the links are drawn : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    if @xmath79 then there are no holes and @xmath45 always contains only one connected component , which , of course , equals to @xmath41 itself . in the latter case ,",
    "the probability that @xmath41 and @xmath80 are connected equals @xmath81 and we are back to a setup similar to that of erds - rnyi .",
    "we wish to emphasise here that all the random graph models mentioned in this section mimic the idea of rank-1 random graphs in the sense that the probability of connecting any two vertices depends on the _ weights _ associated with the vertices .",
    "it has been noticed in @xcite that our random graph model can be treated as an instance of the general inhomogeneous random graph , if each interval is treated as a vertex .",
    "however , in our random graph model the connection between any two vertices depends on the size of overlap of the two intervals , and not only on the individual lengths of the intervals ( which can be considered as weights ) .",
    "this property not only separates our model from the class of rank-1 models , but also marks it as the first model which is inherently different from those random graph models which appear to mimic the idea of rank-1 random graphs .",
    "the critical curve of the quantum random graph in the @xmath82-coordinate quarter plane is already known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and is given by : @xmath83 which follows from comparisons with critical branching process with the offspring distribution given by the _ cut - gamma _ distribution @xmath84 .",
    "it has been proved that if @xmath85 such that @xmath86 an emergence of an @xmath6-giant connected component happens in the disjoint decomposition and if @xmath85 such that @xmath87 typical connected component of any point @xmath88 is of order @xmath7 .",
    "this is a quantum version of erds - rnyi phase transition phenomenon .",
    "the objective of this paper is primarily two fold : first to analyze the component sizes at criticality and then to analyze this model for values of the parameters lying in a small window around the criticality . before stating the results we remark here that our definition of size of a connected component in the quantum random graph model is the number of intervals in the component .",
    "we note here that unlike the cases dealt with in @xcite , the exploration process ( or the breadth first walk ) corresponding to our model can visit an already visited vertex ( circle ) . in general , it can do so as many times as the number of intervals sharing the same vertex , which is a _ finite but unbounded random variable_. this difference makes our analysis quite challenging .",
    "although , in proving results related to the sizes of component we have managed to surpass the above technical difficulty by proving that these multiple returns take place with very small probability . however , these probabilities are not small enough to be ignored when we consider the scaling limits of ordered set of component sizes in our model .",
    "in fact , only the first return plays a crucial role , and the subsequent returns indeed carry such small probabilities that they do not play any major role in our results . the difference between the limiting process in @xcite and in our work is the coefficient @xmath89 . as it becomes clear from the proof , it represents the already explored ( during the first visit ) portion of a vertex ( circle ) .",
    "finally , we note here that questions in the spirit of convergence of random graphs as metric spaces are still open for our model primarily because of this precise problem of multiple visits to the same vertex .",
    "we see through our proofs that our model belongs to the erds - rnyi universality class primarily due to two reasons : first is the very small probability of multiple returns to the same vertex , and second is the fact that the exploration process in our model seems to forget it s past , and behave almost like a markov process .",
    "this feature of our model can be used to check many other inhomogeneous random graph models if they belong to the erds - rnyi universality class .",
    "we also note here that the first reason that of small probability of multiple returns can further be relaxed but the second reason that of approximate markovian behaviour is crucial .",
    "the first result of this paper complements @xcite , as it answers questions similar to those in @xcite , but at criticality .",
    "[ thm : crit : size ] let @xmath90 be the largest component in the critical quantum random graph . then",
    ",    * there exist constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 , such that for all @xmath93 and @xmath94 , there exists a constant @xmath95 such that @xmath96 * there exist @xmath97 and @xmath98 such that for all @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we have @xmath101    consequently , one can conclude that the size of a typical connected component is @xmath102 , which matches well with the corresponding results for the erds - rnyi random graph .",
    "this naturally leads one to believe that the quantum random graph may indeed fall in the same universality class as the erds - rnyi random graph , which is precisely the second result of this paper .",
    "however , in order to state the result , we first need to define some related quantities . to begin with , as in @xcite ,",
    "the surplus edges in a component are , intuitively , those edges , which when removed , make the component become a tree . the precise definition will be given in step ( iv ) of exploration process in section [ subsec : exploration ] , and in that notation @xmath103    next , starting with standard brownian motion @xmath104 , we define a new process @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "further , we define the following process @xmath107 and a corresponding marks process @xmath108 , which can be characterized as the counting process for which @xmath109    then ,    [ thm : joint : cgs ] let @xmath110 denote the ordered sizes of the components in the quantum random graph with parameters \\{@xmath111 for some @xmath23 ; and let @xmath112 be the surplus of the @xmath26-th component . then as @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 denote the ordered lengths of the excursions of @xmath116 above zero , and @xmath117 denote the mark counts corresponding of the process @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , the convergence of the rescaled component sizes holds with respect to the @xmath119 topology defined in @xcite .",
    "our proofs evolve around an exploration process which is a tool to estimate the size of a connected component in random graphs .",
    "rest of this paper is partitioned into two parts . in section [ sec : crit : scale ] , we shall prove theorem [ thm : crit : size ] by adapting the ideas set forth in @xcite to our model .",
    "the primary idea is to cleverly construct two counting processes which stochastically dominate ( from above and below ) the original counting process which determines the size of the component . this way we avoid the process of precise counting , and the difficulties associated with it .",
    "however , the same can not be done in proving theorem [ thm : joint : cgs ] , since it requires precise estimates , rather than crude upper and lower bounds . in section [ sec : joint : cgs ] , we shall put together the proof of theorem [ thm : joint : cgs ] , which is presented in multiple steps , leading to the main result .",
    "two of the main results , which set our analysis apart are propositions [ prop : nu - m ] and [ prop : nu-1 - 0 ] , which are statements about the number of vertices which have already been visited once , twice , or more number of times .",
    "these crucial estimates brings our analysis one step closer to that of @xcite , and allows us to follow the program of @xcite .",
    "in sections [ subsec : brownian : excursions ] and [ subsec : surplus : edges ] , we prove the convergence of breadth first walk and the process of marking surplus edges to appropriate continuous time analogs , respectively . finally , in section [ subsec : joint : convergence ] , we collate all the results , and prove theorem [ thm : joint : cgs ] .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the problem of revisiting the same vertex multiple number of times makes it difficult for us to get working estimates for the distribution of the exploration process .",
    "we get over this problem by introducing two processes , which stochastically dominate the exploration process from above and below .",
    "this enables us to get appropriate upper and lower bounds for the probabilities appearing in theorem [ thm : crit : size ] .    in the following section we shall first describe the exploration process .",
    "thereafter in sections [ subsec : overcounting ] and [ subsec : free - exploration ] , we shall present the proofs of the two parts of theorem [ thm : crit : size ] .",
    "let us start with defining the exploration process corresponding to our model , originally defined in @xcite for one cluster . using this algorithm we shall construct / sample the quantum random graph , interval by interval .",
    "first , order the vertices ( circles ) . at time @xmath46",
    "let @xmath120 be the number of active intervals and the number of explored intervals will be @xmath46 .",
    "_ * initial stage : * _ take the first vertex ( say @xmath121 ) and sample an interval @xmath122 around @xmath123 in the following way , which is governed by the process of holes .",
    "let @xmath124 be two independent exp(@xmath44 ) random variables .",
    "if @xmath125 then @xmath126 . otherwise , @xmath127 . in the sequel we shall refer to the distribution of the length of @xmath122 as to @xmath128 . at time",
    "@xmath129 the interval @xmath122 is the only active interval .",
    "analogous to the exploration process of the erds - rnyi random graph we call all the other parts of the space neutral . since the intervals are not sampled yet it makes more sense to call the whole circles neutral ( or free ) rather than intervals .",
    "finally , set @xmath130 .",
    "_ * at time @xmath46 : * _    * if @xmath131 , let @xmath132 be the active interval belonging to the vertex with the smallest ordering number . *",
    "if @xmath133 and there exists at least one free vertex ( whole neutral circle ) , then sample the interval including @xmath134 with @xmath135 being the first free vertex in the same way as described for @xmath122 above .",
    "let @xmath132 be this interval . * if @xmath133 and there is no free vertex , then sample the neutral interval with the smallest beginning point and let @xmath132 be this interval .    _",
    "connections of @xmath132 : _ denote by @xmath135 the vertex @xmath132 belongs to . for each vertex @xmath25 run @xmath136 on the @xmath137 . for each link check :    * if the resulting link is connected to the already explored interval , simply ignore ( erase ) this link .",
    "* if the resulting link is connected to a free vertex , sample an interval @xmath138 around the point of connection @xmath139 in the following way ruled by the process of holes .",
    "let @xmath124 be two independent exp(@xmath44 ) random variables . if @xmath125 then @xmath140 . otherwise , @xmath141 .",
    "namely , @xmath142 defined above . * if the resulting link is connected to the neutral part @xmath143 of a vertex which already has explored interval(s ) , sample an interval @xmath138 around the point of connection @xmath139 in the following way ruled by the process of holes .",
    "let @xmath124 be two independent exp(@xmath44 ) random variables , then @xmath144 .",
    "* if the resulting link is connected to an active interval , keep this link .",
    "these type of links play the role of surplus edges .",
    "namely , if one erases these type of links , the resulting cluster will be a tree .",
    "denote by @xmath145 the number of neutral intervals connected to @xmath132 and change their status to active .",
    "then set @xmath132 itself explored .",
    "note that in order to be able to construct the quantum random graph we need to keep track of all the active and explored intervals ( beginning and ending points ) . by the definition of @xmath120 we have the following recursion : @xmath146    although we do not define the distribution of @xmath145 explicitly , one can get it from  _ connections of @xmath132 _ \" part of the algorithm .",
    "however , it is obvious that the conditional distribution of @xmath145 given @xmath147 is stochastically dominated by bin@xmath148 , with @xmath142 .",
    "note that the first time when the process @xmath149 , is when the exploration of the cluster which includes the origin of the process @xmath120 , ends .",
    "in other words , let us define @xmath150 , then by @xmath151 the number of explored intervals equals @xmath152 , the size of the cluster which includes the vertex @xmath121 .    due to the intricate nature of our model , it is rather difficult to analyze this exploration process without resorting to approximations .",
    "thus , we shall define two more counting processes which will dominate the aforementioned exploration process from above and below .",
    "these processes will be far more amenable to analyze , hence paving the way for easier computations .",
    "let us begin with a collection of independent pairs of random variables @xmath153 such that @xmath154 s are all i.i.d . with @xmath155 , and given @xmath154 , the random variable @xmath156 is distributed as bin@xmath157 .",
    "then , define the following process @xmath158 clearly , since the random variables @xmath145s is dominated by @xmath159s , therefore the process @xmath120 is consequently dominated by @xmath160 .",
    "however note that this is not a martingale , and define @xmath161 as the martingale extracted out of the process @xmath160 .",
    "also , note that @xmath162 which suggests that @xmath163 for all @xmath46 , since @xmath164 , which in turn implies that @xmath165 also dominates @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , we can couple @xmath165 to @xmath120 in such a way that @xmath166 for all @xmath46 .    note that for a fixed @xmath167 , the set @xmath168 can be rewritten as @xmath169 .",
    "next let us define @xmath170 since @xmath171 , @xmath172 implies that either @xmath173 or @xmath174 . therefore",
    ", we have @xmath175 thus , in order to get an upper bound for @xmath176 we need to estimate the two probabilities appearing on the right hand side of the above equation .",
    "applying optional sampling theorem , together with markov s inequality we get @xmath177    thereafter , let @xmath178 be another copy of @xmath179 , then we have the following which is akin to lemma 5 of @xcite .",
    "@xmath180    which is a consequence of the same set of arguments as set forth in lemma 5 of @xcite .",
    "thus , we have @xmath181 which implies that the overshoot @xmath182 conditioned on the event @xmath183 is stochastically bounded by the random variable @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , using corollary 6 of @xcite with @xmath184 for the process",
    "@xmath165 , we get , @xmath185 \\le h^2 + 3h , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{for large enough $ h$,}\\ ] ]    also note that @xmath186 is a martingale , which can be used to conclude that @xmath187 \\ ] ] subsequently , taking @xmath167 so that @xmath188 , and using equations & , we get @xmath189 where @xmath190 . thus , for large enough @xmath167 we can conclude that there exists a @xmath17 such that @xmath191    subsequently , writing @xmath192 , we have @xmath193    let @xmath194 , then @xmath195 implies @xmath196 , which in turn implies @xmath197 now , we shall use this bound on typical component size to obtain a similar bound for the largest component @xmath90 , for which let us introduce @xmath198 as the cumulative size of components , which have at least @xmath199 vertices .",
    "clearly , @xmath198 is either zero , or is larger than @xmath199 , therefore , @xmath200 implies that there must be at least one component whose size is larger than @xmath199 , thus resulting in the following set of inequalities , @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "next , for any @xmath203 choosing @xmath204 the above inequality simplifies to @xmath205 which proves the first part of theorem [ thm : crit : size ] .",
    "now that we have an upper bound , we shall try to get a lower bound , which in turn will shed some light on the order of the size of the largest component .      the principal idea",
    "to obtain the lower bound is to consider a similar process as above , but one which counts only the free vertices .",
    "as it has been mentioned earlier , in our model , each @xmath206 can be revisited many times , and by counting only the free vertices we overrule the possibility of revisiting the same vertex , thus achieving the goal of undercounting .",
    "namely , in this process , each component contain at most the same amount of intervals as the original exploration process .",
    "this undercounting process is similar to the exploration process in @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of clarity we shall define this process .",
