    "in this work we shall bring together two research subjects in theoretical physics grown respectively in the late seventies / early eighties and developed along the past forty years .",
    "the first topic is the study of quantum fluctuations of kinks and other topological defects .",
    "dashen , hasslacher , and neveu ( dhn ) @xcite started the investigation of this problem within the framework of the @xmath0-expansion in quantum field theory with the motivation of understanding hadrons as quantum descendants of solitary ( or even solitonic ) non - linear waves . very soon after , several authors shaped this field of research almost definite both in russia , faddeev and korepin @xcite , and the united states , coleman , jackiw , goldstone , christ and lee @xcite .",
    "the second theme is supersymmetric quantum mechanics . introduced by witten @xcite in order to elucidate a mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking , the idea triggered an inflationary process of exploring physical supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems ,",
    "see the review of cooper et al . @xcite and the books of freund @xcite and junker @xcite to find full information about the basic ideas in susy quantum mechanics .    in references",
    "@xcite dhn performed a very detailed analysis of the kink mass shift issue in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional sine - gordon and @xmath1 scalar field theory models .",
    "in particular , the authors succeeded in computing the one - loop order mass shifts for the soliton and kink non - linear waves existing in these models .",
    "they recognized that the kink mass shift induced by the quantum fluctuations must be due to three contributions : 1 ) the kink zero - point energy collecting the energy of the kink ground state , where all the fluctuation modes are unoccupied , 2 ) the analogous vacuum zero - point energy that must be subtracted , and 3 ) the energy induced by the one - loop renormalization mass counter - term on the kink background ( measured with respect to the same effect on the vacuum ) .",
    "note that the first two contributions require the computation of the difference between the traces of the kink and vacuum fluctuation operators , which are respectively schrdinger and helmholtz differential operators .",
    "the final expression encompassing all these contributions is known as the dhn ( dashen - hasslacher - neveu ) formula and expresses the kink mass quantum shift in terms of the spectral data -bound state eigenvalues and scattering wave phase shifts- of the second - order small kink fluctuation operator .",
    "a remarkable fact to be stressed is that the kink fluctuation operators governing the @xmath1 and sine - gordon kink fluctuations are reflectionless pschl - teller type schrdinger operators . in these cases ,",
    "both the kink and vacuum fluctuation operators exhibit a half - bound state , a singlet state with eigenvalue just at the threshold of the continuous spectrum .",
    "a general study of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional scalar field theory models enjoying this type of kink fluctuation operators can be found in the references @xcite .",
    "as early as in 1978 olive and witten @xcite unveiled the character of bps states of the kinks ( and other topological defects ) in field theories with extended supersymmetry and the connection with the central charges of susy algebra .",
    "this property makes the bps kink mass very robust against quantum fluctuations . nevertheless , by the end of the decade of the nineties",
    "the topic of quantum fluctuations of kinks underwent a comeback in the supersymmetric field theoretical framework .",
    "a thorough analysis of the dhn formula is given in @xcite , where the authors uncover the mode number cut - off regularization procedure underlying this formula . in this regularization method the difference between the traces of the kink and vacuum fluctuation operator is determined by computing the difference between the contributions of the same number of eigenmodes in the kink and vacuum fluctuation operators .",
    "the main goal of these works , however , was the quantization of supersymmetric kinks , where the contributions of fluctuations of the bosonic and the fermionic fields cancel each other , relieving the need of identifying the details of the spectrum of the kink and vacuum hessian operators .",
    "subtleties , however , come into play which are related to : the choice of different boundary conditions , e.g. , periodic boundary conditions , dirichlet , and/or robin boundary conditions , etcetera , ii ) diverse regularization methods , for instance , energy cutoff , mode number cutoff , higher - order derivatives , iii ) the development of phase shift analysis , see references @xcite . in the @xmath1 and sine - gordon models ,",
    "the contributions of the half - bound states to the one - loop mass shift due to kink and vacuum fluctuation operators annihilate each other in the mode number cut - off regularization context .",
    "thus , the original dhn formula , which is perfectly adapted to reflectionless kink fluctuation operators , works properly .",
    "this old formula , however , needs to be slightly modified to deal with models whose kink fluctuation operator has a non - vanishing reflection coefficient . in this case",
    ", the spectrum of kink fluctuations does not embrace a half - bound state , unlike the vacuum fluctuation operator .",
    "the necessary modification was unveiled from the one - dimensional levinson theorem and described in reference @xcite .",
    "the outcome is a generalized dhn formula , which is the starting point in this work .",
    "the dhn formula , old or new , demands full information about the second - order small kink fluctuation operator spectrum : not only the eigenvalues but analytical knowledge of the eigenfunctions , which encode the phase shifts , is necessary because the spectral densities enter the dhn formula .",
    "this is an important handicap in the effectiveness of these formulas since the number of exactly solvable spectral problems is reduced .",
    "although this paper is devoted to the exact computation of the kink mass quantum correction by employing the dhn formula , we do mention the existence of alternative methods that approximately compute the one - loop kink mass shift from the spectral zeta function regularization method , see @xcite .",
    "the idea is to rely on the determination of the spectral zeta function of the kink fluctuation operator via the mellin transform of the heat trace of the same operator and then use the asymptotic expansion of this latter spectral function to obtain information about the kink fluctuation asymptotics . during the last decade two of us and",
    "our colleagues benefited from the theoretical machinery available by applying these tools at our disposal to write the one - loop kink mass shift as a truncated series in the seeley coefficients of the kink - hessian - heat function in several @xmath2-dimensional scalar field theory models @xcite and abelian gauge higgs models @xcite .    in this paper , however",
    ", we shall profit from the spectral information about the kink fluctuation operator obtained by using the techniques available in supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite . in these corresponding systems , the spectrum ( eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ) of a given schrdinger operator",
    "is related to the spectrum of a susy partner operator : the two operators are iso - spectral ( except possible zero modes ) and the eigenfunctions are intertwined by the action of the supercharges .",
    "the spectrum of stable kink fluctuations is non - negative . since it is the spatial derivative of the kink solution , the ground state ( a zero mode )",
    "is always known .",
    "knowledge of the ground state wave function allows us to factorize the schrdinger operator in two first - order differential operators ( this being the building blocks of the supercharges ) where the superpotential is the logarithm of the zero mode .",
    "the susy partner second - order differential operator is obtained by multiplying the two first - order operators in reverse order . by construction",
    "the susy partner operators are , up to zero modes , quasi -isospectral but frequently the eigenfunctions of one of the operators are simpler than the eigenfunctions of the other .",
    "our strategy in this work is to rewrite the dhn formula in terms of the spectral data of the new operator in the case where the eigenfunctions of the original operators are too complicated to use the associated spectral density in the analytical integrals . in the privileged cases of sine - gordon , @xmath1 , and the so - called parent models ,",
    "see @xcite , the susy partner operators describing the kink fluctuations enjoy exactly solvable spectral problems .",
    "moreover , all these schrdinger operators belong to the hierarchy of reflectionless pschl - teller potentials . starting from a given kink hessian one can descend through all the members of the hierarchy to end in the free helmholtz operator .",
    "the necessary spectral data in the dhn formula applied to these kinks can be obtained by this process from the vacuum spectral data , such that the computation of the kink mass quantum correction becomes almost trivial .",
    "there are other models with much more complicate kink solitary waves where this susy quantum mechanical structure simplifies ( enables ) the computation of kink mass shifts due to one - loop fluctuations out of reach from a direct approach .",
    "usually , the recursive use of the above scheme allows us to write the kink mass shift in terms of the spectral data for a susy partner operator that lacks bound states .",
    "finally , we shall construct families of field theory models whose kink fluctuation operators share a unique susy partner operator .",
    "therefore , the mass quantum corrections for all the kinks in these models are identical , forming a kind of susy universality class .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce the notation and general background on the subject : kink mass quantum corrections in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional scalar field theory models . in this section",
    "we also make explicit the relations between the spectral data of the second - order small kink fluctuation operator and its susy - partner operator .",
    "in subsection 2.2 we re - express the generalized dhn formula in terms of the spectral information of this new operator , while in subsection 2.3 we accomplish the same task for any operator in the hierarchy of susy - partner operators .",
    "we apply this reformulation of the dhn formula to the sine - gordon , @xmath1 and parent models , profusely studied in the literature .",
    "the novel approach unveils the exact results in a more direct way than the standard method .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the application of this scheme to the computation of the kink mass quantum correction in more sophisticated scalar field theory models .",
    "the first one is characterized by a potential energy density @xmath3dinger operators having a unique common supersymmetric partner . in sub - sections 4.2 and 4.3",
    "a similar analysis will be performed on two - parametric families of two - gap schr@xmath4dinger operators exhibiting an interesting hierarchical structure .",
    "in this section we shall introduce the theoretical background that will be used to deduce a new version of the dashen - hasslacher - neveu ( dhn ) formula depending on the spectral information of the susy partner to the second - order kink fluctuation operator . in some models",
    "the new formula offers us the possibility of successfully computing the one - loop kink mass quantum correction even though it can not be calculated directly from the standard formula .",

    "if this is the case , spatially extended field configuration solutions of finite energy can exist .",
    "in their center of mass they solve the second - order ode @xmath45 together with the asymptotic conditions @xmath46 because @xmath35 is a discrete set the evolution in time from a given set of asymptotic conditions ( [ asymptotic ] ) to another set would cost infinite energy .",

    "non - topological kinks , however , give rise to translational modes with one node and can not be the ground state .",
    "there is an eigenstate of negative energy and non - topological kinks are unstable .",
    "thus , the one - loop mass shift of non - topological kinks picks an imaginary part since it corresponds to resonances in the quantum domain , whereas stable topological kinks are bona fide quantum eigenstates of the field theoretical hamiltonian .",
    "the existence of the zero mode ground state is the crucial fact for building the structure of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in the @xmath73 spectral problem .",
    "the @xmath73 operator can be written as the product of two first - order operators in the form @xmath86 where the function @xmath87 is minus the derivative of the superpotential @xmath88 , the logarithm of the ground state wave function : @xmath89 explicitly , the second - order kink fluctuation @xmath73 operator is defined in terms of the @xmath87 function : @xmath90 quite generically the asymptotic behavior of the derivative of the superpotential at very large distances from the origin is : @xmath91 $ ] where @xmath92 .",
    "thus , @xmath93 there is a partner schrdinger operator that is also factorized in terms of the first - order @xmath94 and @xmath95 operators but in the reverse order : @xmath96    all this calls for the construction of the following @xmath97 supersymmetric quantum mechanical system : there are two supercharges @xmath98 that close the supersymmetry algebra @xmath99 the hamiltonian @xmath100 is supersymmetric because it commutes with the supercharges , @xmath101 , which are consequently constants of motion of the system . in sub - section 2.4",
    "we shall describe the very well known properties of the spectrum of supersymmetric hamiltonians that will help us in our main task of computing one - loop kink mass shifts .",
    "we now shall explain how the supersymmetric quantum mechanical structure of the topological kink stability problem is indeed deeply encrypted in the bps or first - order ode ( [ ode1 ] ) . plugging the field configurations written as the kink plus a small fluctuation @xmath102 into the bps equations we find new solutions if and only if the following linear ode holds : @xmath103 because the topological kink solves equation ( [ sofode ] ) we know that @xmath104 and the equation ( [ ode1 ] ) means that @xmath105 .",
    "the differential operators in the equation ( [ folde ] ) are no more than the factorization operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the factorization property of the second - order kink fluctuation operator is closely related to the existence of first - order equations in the scalar field theory model .",
    "this , at first sight , hidden property of bps kinks is in the backyard of the mechanism essentially discussed in reference @xcite and used explicitly in papers @xcite . starting from a given superpotential function @xmath106 the field theory model can be reconstructed by following the subsequent steps : ( a ) from the equation ( [ superpotential ] ) we write the zero mode in terms of the superpotential : @xmath107 ( b ) from the zero mode ( [ zeromode ] ) the kink solution is obtained through indefinite spatial integration : @xmath108 ( c ) the final step is the most delicate one .",

    "some type of @xmath115-continuity is needed to extend @xmath32 to the rest of the field space .",
    "we shall make use of this procedure in the section 3 in order to construct some field theoretical models starting from a given kink zero mode .",
    "after identifying a classical kink solution we are interested in analyzing its quantum properties . pursuing this goal dashen , hasslacher and neveu succeeded in computing the one - loop quantum correction to the classical mass of the kink and soliton found in the @xmath1 and sine - gordon models @xcite . after a zero - point renormalization and a subsequent mass renormalization , these authors obtained what is now known as the dhn formula , which has been generalized in @xcite for operators having a non - transparent scattering spectrum .",

    "we recall that @xmath63 is the potential well of @xmath73 minus the non - zero threshold @xmath121 .",
    "it is worthwhile at this point to explain the physical origin of the different terms in formula ( [ gdhn ] ) :    1 .",
    "the first two terms encode the contribution of the singlet ( bound and half - bound ) states to the kink fluctuation energy .",
    "the third term corresponds to the subtraction of the singlet state of the vacuum fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the positive term in the integral over the scattering modes collects all the kink minus vacuum continuous spectrum fluctuations to the energy .",
    "3 .   the finite fourth term comes from using an intermediate regularization setting the same number of kinks as vacuum fluctuation modes , rather than a cutoff in the kink and vacuum energies .",
    "all these terms assemble together make what one might call kink casimir energy .",
    "the remaining , negative , term in the integral is due to the contribution to the fluctuation energy of the one - loop renormalization mass counterterm .",
    "nevertheless , the use of expression ( [ gdhn ] ) brings with it a handicap : complete analytical knowledge of the spectral data concerning the second - order kink fluctuation @xmath73 operator is a rare occurrence in generic ( 1 + 1)-dimensional scalar field models .",
    "this makes the computation of the kink mass shift seldom feasible .",
    "the goal of this paper is to take advantage of the techniques available in 1d supersymmetric quantum mechanics in order to alleviate the dependence on the spectral information of the dhn formula ( [ gdhn ] ) .",
    "the aim in this section is to rewrite the generalized dhn formula ( [ gdhn ] ) in terms of the spectral data of the supersymmetric partner operator @xmath122 to @xmath73 .",

    "it is useful to write the above - discussed family of potentials in a way that trades the @xmath325 parameter by spatial displacements of potential wells and kinks .",
    "the redefinition @xmath416 is similar but slightly more complicated than the analogous transformation performed in the sub - section 4.1 .",
