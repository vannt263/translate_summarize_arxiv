    "since 1985 , when the presence of non - statistical fluctuations has been evidenced in the dependence of the cross section of deep inelastic processes on the incident energy @xcite , the excitation function statistical analysis became a method to obtain information on the di - nuclear system ( dns ) lifetime .",
    "naturally it was addressed the question if the lifetime extracted from the ef analysis is identifiable with the value extracted previously from the angular distributions of the final fragments .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the dns lifetime extracted by these two methods are close to each other .",
    "they reached this conclusion based on a reaction model in which the partial coherence mechanism already addressed in @xcite has been considered .",
    "indeed the model leads to an angular distribution pattern having a degree of focusing given by the number of interfering partial waves and to fluctuating excitation functions .",
    "the analysis within this model has been done for the @xmath5si + @xmath6ni and @xmath7c + @xmath8 mg systems for which experimental information was available by that time .",
    "afterwards the excitations functions in dissipative heavy ion collisions ( dhic ) have been measured and analyzed for other light and medium mass systems : @xmath9f + @xmath10y , @xmath5si + @xmath11ti , @xmath9f + @xmath12cu , @xmath5si + @xmath5si , @xmath9f + @xmath13v @xcite .",
    "a new model , partial overlapping molecular level model ( pomlm ) , has been also developed in order to explain the presence of the fluctuations in the ef for dhic introducing , besides the partial coherence , the hypothesis that the dns is excited in the low density region of molecular levels @xcite.the large amplitude of the fluctuations persists due to the lower density of the states in the vicinity of the yrast line .",
    "an unified explanation for fluctuation phenomenom in the excitation functions of elastic , inelastic and deep inelastic collision has been obtained .",
    "the aim of the excitation functions for @xmath9f + @xmath0al and @xmath0al + @xmath0al collisions measured by us was to see to what extent the fluctuation phenomenom is present in the case of these light systems where none of the participants to the reaction is an @xmath14-conjugate nucleus .    for the system",
    "@xmath9f + @xmath0al the excitation functions have been obtained for the final fragments with z = 6 - 12 for a total kinetic energy loss ( tkel ) window of 5 mev width centered at 20 and 30 mev in order to study the dependence of this phenomenom on tkel .",
    "such a study has not been addressed before .",
    "non - statistical fluctuations have been evidenced in the cross section efs of final fragments and for the corresponding fluctuation correlation widths , @xmath15 , no dependence on z , tkel and fragment emission angle , @xmath16 , has been observed within error limit @xcite .",
    "an average value of @xmath15 of ( 170@xmath265 ) kev has been obtained .",
    "the corresponding dns lifetime ( 3.9 @xmath2 1.1)@xmath310@xmath4 sec is in agreement with the values extracted from angular distribution studies @xcite .",
    "the present paper presents results obtained for the @xmath0al + @xmath0al collision . after a short review of the experimental procedures and the criteria used to select deep inelastic events in section [ expr ] , results obtained from cross section efs analysis for the @xmath0al + @xmath0al system",
    "are reported in subsection [ sa ] of the paper .",
    "the subsection [ evcor ] is dedicated to the presentation of a study of the influence of the evaporation corrections on the fluctuating structure of ef .",
    "a pattern of the energy autocorrelation function with secondary damped oscillations besides the lorentzian structure from @xmath17 = 0 , where @xmath17 is the energy increment in the center of mass system ( cms ) , was obtained .",
    "the observed oscillation periodicity could be explained if hyperdeformed rotational states are supposed to be excited in dns during the collision @xcite .",
    "this aspect is discussed in subsection [ deform ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the experiment was performed at the smp tandem accelerator from lns -catania using @xmath0al ions with incident energies e@xmath18 = ( 122 - 132 ) mev .",
    "the energy loss in self supported targets of @xmath0al ( @xmath19 75 kev ) is less than the energy increment of 250 kev ( 125 kev in cms ) between two successive experimental points .",
    "the beam current was measured with a tantalum plated faraday cup provided with an electron suppressing guard ring .",
    "the reaction products were detected and identified using the experimental device dracula @xcite from which only the large area position sensitive ionization chambers ( ics ) and the corresponding parallel plate avalanche counters in front of them have been operated .",
    "the ics were filled with ar(90% ) + ch@xmath20(10% ) at 106.8 torr .",
    "the polar and azimuthal angles spanned by the ic were @xmath21 = 24@xmath22 , @xmath23 = 4@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the energy resolution at the elastic peak was 2.5% , the angular resolution 0.5@xmath22 and the charge resolution better than 0.3 charge units .",
    "the ics being centered at 24@xmath22 in the laboratory system , an angular range 12@xmath24 was covered continuously in a single measurement for each incident energy . the grazing angle at e@xmath18 = 132 mev is of @xmath19 15 @xmath22 , so the weight of deep inelastic processes was increased within the measured angular interval . nevertheless , a quasielastic component is present in the tke spectra of fragments with z = 11 , 12 as could be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for e@xmath18 = 128 mev .",
    "the arrows on the figure represent the energies corresponding to complete energy damping @xcite .",
    "the excitation functions for deep inelastic processes are obtained taking events with tke larger than these values and well bellow the quasielastic component . the tke window",
    "used for e@xmath18 = 128 mev is represented by the hatched area on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and corresponds to the total kinetic energy loss window from 20 to 32 mev , kept the same for all incident energies .",
    "the obtained excitation functions present fluctuations with quite large amplitude as could be observed in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the efs corresponding to z = 8 - 12 , 14 are given .",
    "the full circles represent the cross section of the primary products and the empty triangles of the secondary ones .",
    "the influence of the evaporation corrections on the efs , obtained from comparing the results for these two sets of ef , will be discussed in subsection [ evcor ] . in the following we refer only to the analysis of the ef for primary products .",
    "fluctuations with amplitude larger than the statistical errors , which are of symbol size , could be observed .",
    "the statistical analysis of the efs has been done following the recipe from ref .",
    "fluctuations present in the efs corresponding to different final channels are strongly correlated , evidenced by large channel cross correlation coefficients , @xmath25 , as can be seen in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "this shows that the observed fluctuations are not of compound nucleus origin .",
    "taking into account this correlation , in order to improve the statistics , it was obtained an ef by summing the efs for reaction products having higher yields ( z = 8 , 11 and 12 ) , which is given in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    .[tab1]channel cross correlation coefficients [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the correlation width obtained by us is very close to the value of @xmath15 = 135 kev obtained from the analysis of the ef for dissipative collisions in the @xmath0al + @xmath0al system on a lower incident energy interval e@xmath18 = 114 - 127 mev in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lower value of the correlation width obtained for the @xmath0al + @xmath0al system compared to the case of @xmath9f + @xmath0al system could be explained by the lower excitation energy per nucleon available in heavier system .",
    "the position of the entry region ( horizontal lines correspond to upper and lower e@xmath26 energy for which measurements have been done ) for the two systems is given in fig .",
    "the entry regions for both systems lie in the vicinity of the yrast line ( thick continuous line ) given by the orbital cluster model ( ocm ) energies :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the coulomb barrier , @xmath29 the angular momentum and @xmath30 the total moment of inertia of di - nuclear system .    the thin continuous line on the same figure represents @xmath31 as given by the calculation based on the transport model ( dona code ) @xcite for the higher limit of the measured energy interval .",
    "one can see that the description of the @xmath32 dependence on @xmath33 within the transport model extensively used for heavy systems works quite well for light systems too as it was already noticed in our first study of a light system @xcite .",
    "the extended theory of ericson fluctuations and the other models developed in order to explain the presence of non - statistical fluctuations in dhic @xcite are elaborated for primary reaction products .",
    "experimentally are measured the observables of secondary products and for comparison with models , evaporation corrections have to be done .",
    "the energy spectra were corrected for nucleon evaporation using the iterative procedure described in ref .",
    "a parameterization of neutron and proton separation energies as a function of n / z ratio elaborated for the mass region up to 50 has been used @xcite . in order to estimate the influence of these corrections on the efs of the reaction products resulted from the @xmath0al + @xmath0al interaction , we decided to construct also a set of efs before the evaporation corrections",
    "these are represented with empty triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . at the first sight",
    "no sizable differences between the two sets of efs could be seen . for a more quantitative evaluation",
    ", we calculated eafs for efs obtained without evaporation corrections .",
    "these are represented with empty triangles in fig .",
    "the extracted @xmath34 values are given in the second column of the table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "one can conclude that within error limits a modification of oscillation structure in the efs the by evaporation corrections procedure is not observed , for the present data .",
    "it is not clear that the obtained result could be extended for higher excitation energy .",
    "experimental eaf of dhic shows , besides the lorentzian structure at @xmath17 = 0 , secondary oscillations @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these oscillations appear when the lifetime of dns is equal or greater than its rotation period as a result of interference between different revolutions @xcite .",
    "the period of the secondary structures is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the angular velocity of the di - nucleus .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath17 in connection with the most probable kinetic energy @xmath37tke@xmath38 could be used to obtain an evaluation of the separation distance at the break - up moment of the composite ( di - nuclear ) system and , in this way , information on the deformation of the system during the interaction .",
    "the energy autocorrelation functions from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] present secondary structures with a period of @xmath19 0.85 mev .",
    "such a period of oscillation implies for the distance of separation a value of @xmath39 @xmath19 10.9 fm , taking for the angular momentum the sticking configuration value given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the intrinsic and total momenta of inertia , respectively .",
    "for @xmath43 we used the value of 47.8@xmath44 calculated with the dona code for @xmath45 = 128 mev , and @xmath46 = 43.7@xmath44 was calculated using the formula given in ref .",
    "the value of the separation distance is compatibile with that obtained by us for the @xmath9f + @xmath0al system @xcite . for this value of the separation distance one",
    "obtains , for fragmentation @xmath47na + @xmath48p , a value of @xmath37tke@xmath38 equal to 41.6 mev .",
    "it was supposed that @xmath37tke@xmath38 equals the final channel barrier given by the sum of the coulomb and centrifugal energies @xcite .",
    "the centrifugal energy is calculated for @xmath49 = @xmath50 @xmath19 32.7 .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with the experimental most probable tke of @xmath19 42 mev corresponding to z = 11 ( see corresponding panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one has to remark also that the used value of @xmath50 is within the @xmath49-window ( @xmath49 = 27 - 33 ) corresponding to the integration tkel window ( tke = 32 - 44 mev ) given by the transport model calculation ( thin continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "the separation distance values otained for both studied systems mean a quite large deformation for the reaction partners of the dns .",
    "for relative momentum of inertia at break - up , the following relation can be written :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 = @xmath53 is the usual interaction radius .",
    "it was also necessary to consider larger momenta of inertia in order to explain the period of secondary oscillations observed in the eaf of other systems ( @xmath7c + @xmath8 mg , @xmath8 mg + @xmath8 mg and @xmath5si + @xmath5si ) in this mass region @xcite , while the period of secondary structures of eaf for heavier systems ( @xmath9f + @xmath10y , @xmath54ni + @xmath54ni , @xmath54ni + @xmath55ni , @xmath54ni + @xmath56ti ) from refs .",
    "@xcite could be explained using the moment of inertia calculated at @xmath52 .",
    "this shows the possibility of the existence of super- and hyper- deformation in this mass region , as it was predicted thirty years ago @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded their paper : the outstanding problem is to devise methods that would identify the presence of such superdeformed nuclei which in some existing experiments have been produced without having been detected .",
    "meanwhile experimental methods to evidence the existence of such nuclei have been developed .",
    "one should notice results of recent experiments providing information on nuclear deformation in the mass region close to the mass of the di - nuclear systems studied in the present paper , which appears to be a very interesting one from this point of view .",
    "for example light charge particle spectra emitted by @xmath57ni and @xmath58ti compound nuclei could be described by using in formula ( 1 ) of the yrast line an effective moment of inertia @xmath59 = @xmath60(1+@xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the deformability parameters and @xmath60 is the rigid body moment of inertia @xcite . for deformability parameter values deduced from the fit of experimental spectra , one obtaines for the effective moment of inertia @xmath59 = 1.4@xmath60 and @xmath59 = 1.5@xmath60 for the @xmath57ni and @xmath58ti cn , respectively .",
    "( [ two ] ) obtained for the di - nucleus @xmath64fe is similar to these relations .",
    "the relative momentum of inertia at break - up obtained by us can be also seen as an effective momentum introduced in order to reproduce the experimental periodicity of eaf .    the @xmath65-ray spectrum from the decay of gdr built in hot @xmath56ti was recently measured and its shape suggests the presence of an elongated 3-axial equilibrium shape for this nucleus at j=30@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the excitation functions for the system",
    "@xmath9f + @xmath0al ( di - nucleus @xmath56ti ) have been constructed for tkel windows centered at 20 and 30 mev .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) that for these tkel windows ( tke = 50 - 55 mev and 40 - 45 mev , respectively ) correspond angular momentum values near the region where very elongated shapes could appear .",
    "thus , one can consider the analysis of the cross section efs as a robust experimental method to evidence and extract information on such elongated objects .",
    "the results obtained in the present paper and in the previous ones @xcite , using this method , evidence a large deformation of composite systems formed in the first stage of elastic , inelastic scatering and deep inelastic processes in the mass region 36 - 56 .",
    "the efs analysis for deep inelastic processes in the @xmath0al + @xmath0al collision shows that rotational states with large deformation are excited in the first stage of the reaction .",
    "the correlation width of the fluctuations extracted from cross section ef is equal to ( 115@xmath229 ) kev to which coresponds a dns lifetime of ( 5.7 @xmath2 2.2)@xmath310@xmath4sec .",
    "the large channel cross correlation coefficients show the non - statistical origin of the fluctuations . they support a reaction mechanism where special states of rotational ( molecular ) nature play the role of doorway configurations towards a regime characterized by stochastic exchange of nucleons between interacting nuclei as the main mechanism behind the dissipative phneomena in light heavy ion collisions .",
