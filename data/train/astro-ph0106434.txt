    "thus , the apparent change in orientation between  330  mhz ( @xmath74 ) and  610  mhz ( @xmath75 ) may be due largely to the differences in @xmath68-@xmath69 coverage .",

    "a key assumption in our analysis of the differential image wander is that there is little intrinsic change in the separation of the components . given that on milliarcsecond scales , many sources show evidence of jets and bulk motion , this assumption clearly must be justified .",
    "we have compared our 1.67  ghz observations with those of @xcite .",
    "this comparison is somewhat difficult because , in general , different antennas at different locations were used in the two vlbi arrays .",
    "thus , this comparison is necessarily crude , but it will be sufficient to show that our assumption is reasonable .",
    "@xcite cite a separation of  60  mas between the two components from observations in  1979 september .",
    "if we fit our 1.67  ghz observations with only two components , we find a separation of  58  mas , _ less _ than that of @xcite . even allowing for differences in arrays and uncertainties in the fitting , we conclude that any intrinsic change in the separation between the two components is probably less than 1  mas . over the 20.8  yr separating these measurements ,",
    "any intrinsic motion is probably less than 0.05  mas  yr@xmath109 . at a redshift of  0.354 for  @xcite and for an assumed hubble constant of  65  km  s@xmath109  mpc@xmath109",
    ", this proper motion corresponds to a projected linear separation velocity of  @xmath0 .",
    "our limit is similar to that found by @xcite for , a source with a similar compact double structure .",
    "we have conducted a multi - frequency suite of observations on the source .",
    "we have used these observations to confirm and extend previous conclusions , principally those of @xcite , regarding interstellar scattering along this line of sight .",
    "our 0.61  mhz observations form the third epoch of vlbi observations at this frequency .",
    "our observations are separated by  12 to  16 years from the previous two epochs . as do previous observations",
    ", we find the structure of  at this frequency to be dominated by two components approximately 56  mas apart . within the uncertainties of the various measurements , this separation has remained unchanged for the past 16  years .",
    "we can place a reasonably strict limit of  4  mas on any differential image wander caused by refractive interstellar scattering . in turn , this limit implies that the electron density power spectrum along this line of sight has a spectral index near the kolmogorov value , with a value of  4 being highly unlikely . as the diffractive scattering diameter of the source at this frequency is 21  mas , we conclude that diffractive scattering dominates along this line of sight .",
    "the most significant source of uncertainty in this limit is probably the velocity at which the scattering material is drifting past the line of sight .",
    "a `` high '' velocity of  100  would mean that the separations measured at the three epochs are independent .",
    "a `` low '' velocity of  10  would mean that none of the epochs are independent . even if the velocity of the scattering material is low , the separation between our observations and the previous ones is probably long enough that , if refractive scattering were important on this line of sight , some change in the apparent separation of the components would be expected . nonetheless , future observations of  at  0.61  ghz or similar observations of other sources on lines of sight for which the refractive time scale could be estimated would be useful .",
    "our observations are in good agreement with a variety of observations on the pulsar ( line of sight 87 from ) .",
    "these observations suggest that diffractive scattering also dominates refractive scattering along the line of sight to the pulsar .",
    "our quasi - simultaneous observations range from  0.33 to 8.4  ghz .",
    "we have used these multi - frequency measurements to constrain the frequency dependence of the angular diameter of one component of . at frequencies below  1  ghz ,",
    "the structure of the eastern component of  is dominated by scattering .",
    "fitting for both the density spectrum spectral index  @xmath32 and the scattering diameter  @xmath39 , we find @xmath110 with the value of  4 again highly unlikely . at a nominal frequency of  1  ghz",
    ", we find the scattering diameter to be @xmath111  mas .",
    "we also place a conservative upper limit on the density spectrum inner scale of @xmath112  km .",
    "we also compared our 1.67  ghz observations to those of @xcite , acquired approximately 21  years previously .",
    "we find no evidence for any change in the separation at this frequency .",
    "this places a limit on the projected linear separation velocity of the two components of  @xmath0 .",
