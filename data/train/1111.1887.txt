    "absorption by thermal plasma is probably the preferred mechanism in the low frequency range of the spectra as it is proposed by leahy @xcite .    from the curved spectrum",

    "( [ equ04 ] ) and ( [ equ07 ] ) we obtain @xmath36 = 0.46 . when we put @xmath34 = 22 mhz and @xmath35 = 34.5 mhz the result is @xmath37 = -0.97 .",
    "since we deal with mean brightness temperature , we lose the information about index variation because for each frequency we have only one average value for brightness temperature . using equation ( [ equ02 ] )",
    "we get a connection between brightness temperature and spectral index @xmath3 .",
    "we plot the dependence @xmath38 vs @xmath39 .",
    "the dependence @xmath39 between 408 , 820 and 1420 mhz can be nicely represented by straight line . @xcite obtained mean spectral index @xmath3 = 0.45 using observations presented at 408 and 1420 mhz , and from our fig .",
    "8 using only points at 408 and 1420 mhz we obtained the @xmath3 = 0.47 which is in excellent agreement with leahy s value .",
    "but if we take into account low frequencies 22 and 34.5 mhz we can find that now dependence @xmath38 vs @xmath40 is nicely represented by the polynomial fit of third order .",
    "this indicates that the spectrum of hb 21 is a combination of synchrotron and a thermal components .",
    "the presence of the additional component in the radio spectrum of hb 21 suggests that hb 21 is probably interacting with an adjacent molecular cloud .",
    "the measured data have different resolutions for different frequencies .",
    "in order to obtain @xmath0 plots the data are retabulated .",
    "we convolved data at 1420 , 34.5 and 22 mhz to @xmath41 resolution .",
    "sampling rates of the 820 mhz and 408 mhz survey are much more crude and we did not take it into account . then , for each frequency pair we used only the common points ( with the same @xmath42 ) which belong to the loop area at both frequencies . in that way we reduced loop area to the same area for different frequencies .",
    "the obtained @xmath0 plots for three pairs of frequencies enabled calculating the spectral indices .",
    "we calculated two @xmath3 values for each of these tree frequency pairs : between 142034.5 , 142022 , 34.522 mhz .",
    "for each of the tree frequency pairs , by interchanging the dependent and independent variables we have obtained two @xmath3 values for each pair and the mean value of these fit results is adopted as the radio spectral index , as suggested in @xcite . regarding two pairs of frequencies 142034.5 , 142022 the average value of spectral index from @xmath0 is @xmath43 = 0.47 @xmath4 0.29 .",
    "regarding the lowest pair of frequencies 34.522 , the average value of spectral index from @xmath0 is @xmath44 = -0.82@xmath40.82 .",
    "it can be noticed that this value agrees well with the corresponding value obtained from spectrum , as expected ( see @xcite ) .",

    "our mean spectral index is in agreement with leahy findings .",
    "he found significant spectral index variations and concluded that thermal absorption was the preferred mechanism @xcite .",
    "he concluded that if thermal plasma absorption or ionization losses are the correct mechanism , at frequencies below 408 mhz should show flatter spectral indices and if one should be able to distinguish which mechanism is working , since ionization losses will have no indices flatter than @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we obtained flatter spectral indices then @xmath46 for the hb 21 snr in the low frequency domain , and we can expect that thermal plasma absorption is responsible for the spectral flattening at the lowest radio frequencies .",
    "we use observations of the continuum radio emission at 1420 , 820 , 408 , 34.5 and 22 mhz for estimations of the mean brightness temperatures and surface brightnesses of the hb 21 snr .",
