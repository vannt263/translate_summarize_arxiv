    "the many - body problem can not be solved exactly for realistic interactions and systems .",
    "numerous approximations have been formulated and applied over the years .",
    "one of the problems is that many particles require a large hilbert space to allow for the many possible correlations .",
    "in fact , the space typically grows exponentially with the particle number .",
    "the necessary reduction of the hilbert space to obtain a tractable problem has to be accompanied by a correponding transformation of the interaction which in turn has to be used in the smaller space .",
    "this is the method of effective interactions in reduced spaces .",
    "a different approach starts by an approximation applied to the interaction itself .",
    "in many physical fields , the two - body interaction is a complicated entity , and therefore it is desirable to reduce this complexity .",
    "one such direction is to perform a harmonic approximation of the interaction hamiltonian which leaves all terms ( one- and two - body ) as a polynomial of at most second order in the coordinates of all particles .",
    "this yields an exactly solvable model for the many - body system @xcite .",
    "however , to utilize such an approach , the input parameters must be adjusted to reproduce properties of realistic systems for low particle numbers .",
    "this could be two - body binding and scattering information and structural expectation values .",
    "this sort of approach has been pursued in nuclear and condensed - matter physics for many years @xcite as a source of exact insight into many - body problems @xcite when numerics are either intractable or hard to interpret .",
    "more recently , cold atomic gases have emerged as an arena and testing ground for various models due to the large degree of controllability in experiments @xcite . in particular",
    ", interaction can be controlled through interatomic feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "however , these systems are almost exclusively studied in the presence of an external confining potential which can often be modelled by a ( possibly deformed ) harmonic oscillator . for experimental setups with very deformed traps ,",
    "the geometry can in fact be manipulated to study effective one- or two - dimensional dynamics .",
    "very recently , it has even become possible to explore the few - body limit with trapping of just a few atoms near the degenerate regime @xcite .    at the moment , the physics of ultracold atomic gases is , however , dominated by short - range interacting neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the samples are often extremely dilute , the details of the potential at short - range does not matter , and only low - energy scattering information is important @xcite .",
    "the replacement of the potential by a regularized zero - range potential is therefore often justified . in the presence of a harmonic confinement ,",
    "the solution of the two - body problem with a zero - range potential was presented by busch _",
    "this solution was subsequently confirmed in experiments @xcite .",
    "more recently , this model has been used as a starting point for addressing the few- and many - body problem in a controlled manner in both nuclear and cold atom physics @xcite .",
    "the zero - range approximation scheme is one approach to effective interactions .",
    "here we pursue a different one via harmonic expansion of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "system that can be described in some regimes of parameter space by harmonic hamiltonians are extremely useful due to their solvability . of course ,",
    "as mentioned above , the parameters have to be meningfully related to realistic physical systems .",
    "this can be done through fits to two - body properties as described previously in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we take a parametric approach and study the details of the harmonic approximation for identical quantum particles as function of the two relevant frequencies for such a system ; the ( internal ) interaction frequency and the ( external ) trapping frequencies , both of which are described by ( isotropic ) harmonic terms .",
    "deformation can be easily implemented and will not be considered here .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to describe a method for calculating thermodynamical quantities for systems of identical bosons and fermions , a problem of relevance for any subfield of physics concerned with quantum mechanical behavior of multiparticle system in equilibrium .",
    "this requires full access to the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities that can be derived from it .",
    "the quantum statistics of ensemble of particles is needed here , and we present a general method for obtaining such information for harmonic hamiltonians that works for any number of particles in principle .    there is great interest in the universal thermodynamics of strongly interacting fermi gases @xcite , and measurements have determined the equation of state of the system @xcite .",
    "those studies are mostly concerned with trap - averaged quantities that are less sensitive to sudden changes in thermodynamic behavior as expected near phase transitions .",
    "however , recently it has become possible to determine local properties of the gas by density fluctuation measurements @xcite .",
    "quantities that involve derivatives of the energy or pressure like heat capacity and compressibility can thus be used to study for instance superfluid properties of both fermionic @xcite and bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , the same experiments are also able to explore effects of changing the dimensionality of the system through optical lattice potentials .    in the current presentation",
    "we focus on extending th harmonic approximation into the statictical regime , and more particularly on the technicalities of the method used to achieve this . to demonstrate our method we consider the case of a two - dimensional system of identical bosons or fermions for different ratios of interaction to external trapping frequencies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secmethod ] we briefly recap the harmonic method and then discuss the partition function in the harmonic approximation . the most important part of the method is the counting of the degeneracies in the partition function which we discuss in extended detail .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities are briefly outlined and a discussion of how to related the parameters in the harmonic hamiltonian to the model by busch _",
    "@xcite is given .",
    "practical numerical results are obtained and discussed in sec .",
    "[ secthermo ] for a system of cold atoms confined to two spatial dimensions . both bosons and fermions",
    "are explicitely investigated .",
    "finally , give a summary and an outlook in sec .",
    "[ seccon ] .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 identical quantum particles , fermions or bosons , that have two - body interactions , all of which are confined by an external field .",
    "all interactions are substituted by carefully chosen harmonic oscillators .",
    "the solutions of the hamiltonian can then be found explicitly and treatment of thermodynamic properties is possible .",
    "we first present the necessary ingredients of the model , and continue to develope the method for calculating the partition function .",
    "this includes the key discussion of how to obtain the degeneracies of the many - body states .",
    "the @xmath0-body hamiltonian contains kinetic energy , one- and two - body interaction terms , all of which we assume can be written in terms of second order polynomials in the particle coordinates when proper choice of effective interaction parameters have been made .",
    "the resulting harmonic oscillator structure can be separated into terms related to each of the cartesian coordinates and the hamiltonian in one , two , and three dimensions is a sum of terms from each coordinate . for example , in the @xmath1-direction , the effective hamiltonian is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass of the identical particles and @xmath4 is the reduced mass .",
    "the one - body ( external ) harmonic trap frequency is @xmath5 , while the two - body interaction frequency between all pairs is denoted @xmath6 ( internal ) .",
    "@xmath7 is a constant energy shift which is included for generality .",
    "double counting of interactions account for the factor @xmath8 . for two and three dimensions ,",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will assume that the external harmonic trap is isotropic , extension to the deformed case are straightforward and will be addressed in future work .",
    "all particles are identical and interact in the same way which means that @xmath6 is independent of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . also the one - body frequency ,",
    "@xmath5 , is independent of @xmath12 .    the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "can be solved analytically for any particle number ( details can be found in @xcite ) the pertinent properties in the present context are that the energies , @xmath13 , of the excited states have oscillator character . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the @xmath14th _ many - body _ excited state , i.e. the energy of all @xmath0 particles when they are distributed in a certain way in the oscillator levels that come out of the diagonalization of the full hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate mostly on the case of a two - dimensional system , and we therefore specialize to this case now .",
    "the energy of a many - body state , @xmath13 , can be written @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are quanta in the @xmath1-direction related to the relative and center - of - mass excitations with the former carrying the index @xmath12 running over all @xmath0 particles ( and similar terms for the @xmath18-direction ) .",
    "the total number of relative and center - of - mass quanta in the many - body state @xmath14 are denoted @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 must all be specified to completely characterize the many - body state of energy @xmath13 .",
    "however , more than one set of individual quantum numbers can lead to the same energy @xmath13 and this determines the degeneracy of the state , which we denote @xmath23 and discuss at length below . @xmath13 and @xmath23 are all that is needed to compute the partition function and thus the thermodynamic properties of the system .    the constants , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the formula for @xmath13 , are from the two - dimensional zero - point energy of intrinsic and center of mass parts , respectively .",
    "the one - body frequency , @xmath5 , correspondings to center of mass motion .",
    "the other frequency , @xmath26 , is @xmath27 times degenerate for identical particles .",
    "it is given by the relation @xcite @xmath28 if the two - body interaction goes to zero ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 , and the resulting eigenvalues and eigenfunctions converge to those of the external one - body trapping potential .",
    "the solutions are @xmath0 non - interacting identical particles occupying @xmath0 states in a harmonic oscillator . for interacting particles",
    ", we obtain instead @xmath27 identical frequencies with value given by eq .  .",
    "the extension of the above discuss to three dimensions involves also the @xmath31-direction and is straightforward , although the extra quantum numbers makes the degeneracy larger and the counting of many - body states more involved .    with the harmonic hamiltonian ,",
    "the exact spectrum of excited many - body states , @xmath13 , are thus available for a given number of particles . for the thermodynamic calculations ,",
    "the natural choice is to use the canonical ensemble applicable for a definite number of particles .",
    "the canonical partition function is @xmath32 where @xmath23 is the degeneracy of the @xmath14th many - body state and @xmath33 is the temperature measured in energy units ( the boltzmann constant , @xmath34 ) . once @xmath35 is obtained , all thermodynamic quantities can be derived from it .",
    "the most involved question is how to obtain @xmath23 for a given energy of the many - body system .",
    "this will now be discussed .",
    "the only quantities in the partition function are the energies , @xmath13 , and their degeneracies , @xmath23 .",
    "the energies are appropriate multiples of the harmonic oscillator frequencies introduced above .",
    "the degeneracies depend strongly on which symmetry restriction is imposed .",
    "problems arise when all , or a group of , particles can not be distinguished because they are identical and allow occupation of the same states .",
    "we then have to count the number of ( anti-)symmetric states for the indistinguishable particles of a given excitation energy , @xmath13 , and the corresponding degeneracies , @xmath23 , of each _ many - body _ state of energy @xmath13 .",
    "we now describe our procedure to obtain @xmath23 .",
    "it is based on knowledge of the non - interacting system , a recursive procedure , and the fact that when the two - body interaction vanishes , the degeneracies remain the same as we will now explain .",
    "we start with @xmath0 identical particles without any two - body interaction ( @xmath29 ) , and all in the same external trap with frequency @xmath5 .",
    "this hamiltonian will have @xmath0 degenerate solutions of frequency @xmath5 per spatial dimension ( so @xmath36 for the two dimensional case ) .",
    "the many - body solutions are the products of @xmath0 combinations of the single - particle harmonic oscillator wave functions",
    ". for identical fermions , the pauli principle , or equivalently the antisymmetrization , requires that each of the single - particle states at most is occupied by one particle .",
    "in addition , if this condition of occupancy by at most one particle for each state is fulfilled , then one and only one antisymmetric state is uniquely constructed as the slater determinant of the @xmath0 singly occupied single - particle states .",
    "importantly , the energy can be characterized by the sum , @xmath37 , of single - particle oscillator quantum numbers for all particles in the state @xmath13 , as seen in eqs .   and .",
    "assume that we have computed the number , @xmath38 , of properly symmetrized states of non - interacting identical particles in the external potential .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 can be computed in a simple manner by trail - and - error , i.e. taking all possible permutations and testing which are completely symmetric and which are completely antisymmetric .",
    "this is , however , notoriously difficult since the computational effort is exponentially increasing with particle number .",
    "also , it does not distinguish between center of mass motion and relative motion and this needs to be disentangled .",
    "this can be done by recalling the symmetry of the center of mass as we now discuss .",
    "the center of mass motion is a symmetric mode in all permutations of the particle coordinates , simply because the center of mass coordinate is the sum of the individual particle coordinates .",
    "this motion is always symmetric , independent of the number of quanta in this mode , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the relative motion determines the symmetry of the total wave function .",
    "the excited states consist of a combination of two distinctly different types of excitations .",
    "they are characterized by the number of quanta in the center of mass motion , @xmath20 , and the number of quanta in the relative motion , @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the number of properly ( anti)symmetric @xmath0-body states by @xmath39 , which is the number of states that have the proper symmetry in terms of the _ relative _ coordinates .",
    "it can be computed from knowledge of the total number of non - interacting many - body states , @xmath40 , for all values of @xmath37 .",
    "to do so , one must subtract the number of states of different center of mass quanta from the total number of non - interacting many - body states in a recursive manner , i.e. @xmath41 where the degeneracy , @xmath42 , of the center of mass state depends on the spatial dimension of the oscillator ; @xmath43 for one , @xmath44 for two , and @xmath45 for three dimensions , respectively .",
    "the formula comes from the fact that we know only the total number of quanta , @xmath46 , but _ not _ @xmath19 and @xmath20 individually .",
    "we need to recursively subtract the states that correspond to @xmath47 , 2 , @xmath48 , @xmath46 as the formula prescribes .",
    "the factor @xmath42 is due to the degeneracy of the center of mass motion itself for given number of quanta , @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is well - defined and corresponds to a state with no quanta of excitation , i.e. the ground state .",
    "it can be zero or non - zero depending on @xmath0 and whether the particles are bosons or fermions .",
    ".   determines the degeneracy of an @xmath0-body state in a harmonic system and is one of the main results of this work .",
    "the degeneracy can now be calculated iteratively from eq .   for any number of quanta , @xmath46 from a starting point based on a non - interacting system of identical particles in a trap .",
    "these states must then be either completely symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to interchange of all coordinates of any pair of particles to obey either bosonic or fermionic statistics .",
    "now we add the two - body interaction on top of the external one - body potential .",
    "the external frequency , @xmath5 , remains in the spectrum corresponding to the center of mass motion , and an @xmath27 times degenerate frequency , @xmath26 , appears corresponding to relative motion .",
    "the absolutely crucial point is that the degeneracies do _ not _ depend on the two - body interaction strength which will only influence the value of the degenerate frequency .",
    "the counting remains completely unchanged , because the number of states of a given symmetry is a discrete number which does not change with continuous variation of the interaction .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to a continuous map ( the scheme for counting degeneracies ) from a continuous interval ( the interaction frequency , @xmath26 ) to a discrete set ( number of states , @xmath23 , with given energy ) .",
    "such a map must necessarily be a constant map .",
    "the underlying point here is that our splitting into @xmath20 and @xmath19 is done in a way that moves the states that are related to the relative motion when @xmath26 is increased from zero to its full value , while the states that are related to center of mass motion remain constant in energy since @xmath5 remains a solutions .",
    "we confirmed this simple counting method by an elaborate and computationally very slow brute force procedure which is much worse than computing @xmath38 above .",
    "the ( anti-)symmetrization of each of the computed wave functions is performed by permutations of all the coordinates followed by extraction of a basis with a size equal to the smallest number of linearly independent states . for sufficiently small",
    "@xmath0 this can be computed in reasonable time and comparison can be made . in all cases considered below we found perfect agreement between the numerics and the procedure outlined above .",
    "the procedure above is , however , far superior since it needs only counting of states with given energy , _ not _ the full wave functions .",
    "we can now use eq .   to get the number of center of mass states and the number of relative states as functions of the sum of corresponding quanta .",
    "along with the frequencies , this is all we need to calculate the partition function in eq .  .",
    "this simplification occurs since the structure of the wave functions do not enter in the partition function .",
    "the center of mass mode of frequency @xmath5 separates in eq .   because both the exponential function and the degeneracy factorizes , that is @xmath50 , where the center of mass contribution is analytical and given below eq .  .",
    "we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the dimension , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . in practice",
    ", the infinite sum over relative quanta has to be limited by a cut - off value which is chosen sufficiently high to achieve the required accuracy .",
    "certain quantities are more sensitive to the cut - off than others , such as those with more derivatives of the partition function ( heat capacity , compressibility , etc . ) .",
    "for all the results presented below we have checked convergence by increasing the cut - off and identifying the value of @xmath33 below which the relevant quantities remain unchanged . from the canonical partition function , eqs .   or , we get immediately the basic quantities of energy , @xmath55 and free energy , @xmath56 , that is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the entropy , and @xmath59 is the heat capacity @xcite .    in thermodynamic formulations of macroscopic systems",
    ", both temperature and volume is usually external parameters .",
    "both the energy , @xmath55 , and heat capacity , @xmath59 , defined above , are in principle the derivatives for a fixed volume , @xmath60 ( and also fixed @xmath33 and @xmath0 ) . in our case with an externally confined @xmath0-body system",
    "the volume is not the fixed quantity , but rather it is the external trapping frequency , @xmath5 , that is fixed .",
    "the derivatives above are thus taken for fixed @xmath5 .",
    "usually , variation of the volume allows information about pressure and compressibility .",
    "definitions of these quantities and connection to their thermodynamic counterparts require a precise translation between @xmath5 and volume . here",
    "we employ the simplest choice and define the volume via the length parameter related to the external trap , @xmath61 , which is defined by @xmath62 .",
    "we now have @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the two and three dimensional angular surface areas .",
    "derivatives of any quantity , @xmath66 , with respect to volume can now be written @xmath67 for the pressure , @xmath68 , we find @xmath69 which , from the definition in eq .  , gives @xmath70 the derivatives are easily worked out since they only contain @xmath71 .",
    "continuation to the second derivative with respect to the volume produce the isothermal bulk modulus , @xmath72 , defined as @xmath73 which is the reciprocal of the isothermal compressibility , @xmath74 . again",
    "two terms arise related to center of mass and relative degrees of freedom .",
    "several terms appear by carrying out the two derivatives .",
    "this kind of compressibility , that of a response of a system to an applied pressure , is different to the compressibility of a self - bound system such as a nucleus @xcite . for self - bound systems , the compressibility refers to resistance to density fluctuations .",
    "this can be written as the second derivate of the energy per particle with respect to the fermi momentum for fermionic systems .     from eq .   and the external trap frequency , @xmath5 , as function of the scattering length , @xmath75 , in two dimensions for the busch model @xcite with @xmath76-wave interactions for bosons ( upper ) and for the @xmath77-wave interaction identical ( i.e. spin - polarized ) fermions ( lower ) . in both plots ,",
    "the different curves correspond to different particle numbers . from the bottom to top , the curves are for 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 20 , and 30 particles .",
    "the length parameter is the trapping length , @xmath78 , introduces in the text.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    before we present results for degeneracies and various thermodynamic properties , we discuss how one can fix the two - body interaction term to capture the properties of the realistic system which have interactions that are not harmonic . in the case of identical bosons ,",
    "the procedure was already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite but we repeat the arguments here for completeness .",
    "we assume that we are in the situation that the real two - body interaction is of much shorter range than the external trap length @xmath61 above . in this case",
    ", we can use the zero - range model of busch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to obtain the solutions in the trap .",
    "the effective two - body interaction that we want to use is a harmonic oscillator , which in general contains two parts ; an oscillator frequency , @xmath6 , and a shift , @xmath79 . to fix these parameters",
    "we employ the conditions that the two - body harmonic interaction should reproduce the correct two - body binding energy of the ground state in the busch model , and also the spatial extend of the wave function .",
    "the latter condition is implemented by calculating the root - mean - square radius , @xmath80 , in the exact solution and fixing the oscillator parameter to reproduce value .",
    "the energy shift is suqsequently tuned so as to also reproduce the two - body binding energy .    clearly , since the busch model uses a zero - range interaction , the only scale left is the external trap frequency , @xmath5 .",
    "therefore what we obtain from this is the quantity @xmath81 .",
    "we ignore the shift from now on since it merely provides an overall shift in the @xmath0-body harmonic hamiltonian which is not of interest in the current paper . the next step is to insert this value into eq .   to obtain @xmath82 , which will now naturally depend on @xmath0 .",
    "in the upper panel in fig .  [ busch ] we show the result of this procedure for the case of bosons in two dimensions ( more detail for bosons in both two and three dimensions can be found in ref .",
    "the results are plotted as function of the two - dimensional scattering length @xmath75 .",
    "note that when @xmath75 is small , the ground state becomes strongly bound , while for large @xmath75 it goes to the non - interacting limit .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the behavior of @xmath82 .",
    "the result of this procedure agrees rather well with predictions from the well - studied problem of bosons interacting through a zero - range interaction @xcite in the strong and weak coupling limits @xcite , also in the case where higher - order interaction terms are included @xcite .",
    "recently , a very similar procedure has been used to study polar molecules in layered system @xcite where excellent agreement with exact methods has been found both for isotropic @xcite and anisotropic potentials @xcite which have reasonably large potential pockets . incidentally",
    ", one - dimensional dipolar system also turn out to have such potential pockets @xcite and applying the harmonic approximation to these systems is an interesting direction for future research .    for identical",
    "( spin - polarized ) fermions a complication arises from the fact that the original busch model applies to particles interacting through an isotropic @xmath76-wave interaction only .",
    "the pauli principle dictates that @xmath76-wave interactions are zero for identical fermions , and therefore the interactions must have @xmath77-wave ( or higher odd partial wave ) character . in two dimensions ,",
    "the equivalent of the busch model with @xmath77-waves can be solved and the spectrum turns out to be very similar to the @xmath76-wave case except for ( unimportant ) shifts @xcite . however , a further complication arises since the corresponding ground state wave function is singular at the origin in a manner that does not allow it to be normalized @xcite .",
    "this can be fixed by a properly defined scalar product as discussed for the three - dimensional case in ref .",
    "we will not pursue this approach here but instead we note that any higher order structural average of the type @xmath83 with @xmath84 an integer is still perfectly convergent .",
    "we thus consider a higher order average , @xmath85 , in order to fix the oscillator parameter for identical fermions .",
    "we are thus tacitly using that the @xmath77-wave spectrum is very similar to the @xmath76-wave one and assume that the wave function should be so as well .",
    "of course , it must be kept in mind that this is _ not _ at odds with the pauli principle since the two - body wave function in the @xmath77-wave channel is still zero at the origin . in any case , the pauli principle is exactly enforced on the @xmath0-body system as discussed above .",
    "the results for @xmath82 are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ busch ] .",
    "the similarity to @xmath76-waves and bosons is quite clear , and the only difference seems to be slightly lower overall values for the fermionic case . below",
    "we will illustrate our method by calculating thermodynamic quantities for both fermions and bosons . here",
    "the only thing that matters is the ratio @xmath82 .",
    "one can then reverse the process and use fig .",
    "[ busch ] to obtain a corresponding value of the scattering length and thus compare to a realistic system with trapped bosons or single - component fermions . since this is mainly a discussion of method , we will not dwell on this any further .",
    "an important thing to note , however , is that since the ratios @xmath82 are similar for bosons and fermions , the results below will truly isolate the statistical behavior coming from the exchange requirements in the different cases .",
    "we now proceed to demonstrate our methods by computing the density of states and the thermodynamic quantities that have been introduced above .",
    "they depend on particle mass , dimension , number of particles and their quantum statistics , temperature , one- and two - body frequencies . if we measure all energies in units of @xmath86 , all results for given particles in @xmath52 dimensions , depend only on the two ratios , @xmath87 and @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that any kind of interaction model used to define the effective harmonic hamiltonian only has to provide these two quantities as pointed out above .    , while it is @xmath88 for fermions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] , while it is @xmath88 for fermions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]      first we discuss the degeneracies themselves which are found by the procedure discussed above , essentially through the recursive formula eq .  . while the number of non - interacting ( anti-)symmetric states increases exponentially as function of excitation energy , the numbers can , however , be tremendously reduced by the symmetry requirements . a simple example indicating this tendency is that for bosons all particles are allowed to occupy the lowest level with zero quanta , @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , a given number of fermions has a minimum sum of quanta , @xmath90 , in the ground state , that is @xmath91 .",
    "we show the numbers of given symmetry as functions of excitation energy in fig .",
    "[ fermbos ] .",
    "since we are dealing with harmonic oscillators , a given energy corresponds to a given total number of quanta .",
    "the starting point for the ground state is naturally @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which is larger for fermions than for bosons due to the requirement that at most one fermion can occupy each state .",
    "the corresponding higher degeneracy implies therefore that the number of states of given excitation energy is larger for fermions than for bosons because the latter do not need to obey the pauli principle . for bosons ,",
    "the lowest excited state consisting of one quantum added to zero quanta in the ground state can only be a center of mass excitation , since one quantum in the relative motion would be antisymmetric in one pair of coordinates ( it would have to be a state of @xmath77-wave / parity - odd symmetry ) .",
    "the lowest completely symmetric excited state of the relative motion appear for @xmath94 . in conclusion",
    ", there is always a gap in the excitation spectrum for bosons corresponding to @xmath95 where fermions only have a gap of @xmath96 .",
    "this will be reflected in the temperature dependence below .    for bosons ( upper part of fig .",
    "[ fermbos ] ) the same degeneracy is found for low energy ( small total number of quanta ) for all particle numbers . in the upper plot of fig .  [ fermbos ]",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath97 since we have found that this is a good measure for the excitation energy in the system . for fermions",
    ", one can give a qualitative argument for the exponential behavior which we discuss below .",

    "the compressiblity indicates how easy it is to squeeze the system and a large value indicates that the system is very susceptible to compression .",
    "we see that the more strongly interacting systems ( larger @xmath82 ) have larger @xmath74 .",
    "this comes from the fact that the attraction in these systems will make it energetically favourable to contract , due to the larger degeneracy of the interaction frequency , @xmath26 .",

    "the harmonic approximation is extremely useful because its simplicity allows transparent calculations of otherwise complicated properties .",
    "the only approximation lies in the choice of harmonic potentials acting on each particle and between pairs of particles .",
    "one can therefore think of the harmonic approximation as an effective interaction scheme and subsequently investiagate the behavior of its predictions under changes in the input parameters .",
    "the latter should naturally be connected to whatever realistic physical system one is interested in studying .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the harmonic approximation scheme by considering the hamiltonian for a many - body system consisting of a given number of identical particles .",
    "in particular , we explore the consequences of symmetry requirements on the properties of the system .",
    "this is done with thermodynamic applications in mind since this is a venue where the quantum statistics plays a decisive role at low temperatures .",
    "we develop a new method for counting the number of correctly symmetrized _ many - body _ states that reduces the complications that arise from this fundamental problem of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "the advantage of the harmonic approach is obviously that the energy spectrum is analytically known .",
    "however , the degeneracy of each many - body state of given total energy still remains to be determined before the partition function is fully defined and possible to compute numerically .",
    "we design a novel procedure to obtain the degeneracy of each state , subject to requirements of symmetry and antisymmetry appropriate for bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "we separate the completely permutation symmetric center of mass motion from the relative motion , which then has to carry the symmetry corresponding to bosons or fermions .",
    "we count by subtracting the number of states of different quanta in the center of mass motion from the total number of non - interacting states of given symmetry .",

    "this is done for a relatively small number of particles ( up to 20 ) .",
    "the method is a considerable improvement over the brute force method where one explicitly checks for symmetry properties by exchanging all pairs of particles one by one .",
    "however , it is still computationally involved when going beyond the particle numbers considered here .",
    "however , as is known from for instance the virial expansion @xcite , it is often enough to consider small particle numbers and then extrapolate to large system sizes from this information .",
    "the effective harmonic interaction can be related to quantities in realistic systems and we discuss a case of great usefulness within the realm of ultracold atomic gases , that of two particles interaction in a harmonic trap through a two - body interaction of zero - range . while bosons can interact in the @xmath76-wave channel originally considered by busch _",
    "@xcite , identical fermions must have an antisymmetric relative wave function and thus an @xmath76-wave interaction of short - range will vanish .",
    "we therefore have to consider the @xmath77-wave channel , but we find that the effective harmonic interaction frequencies are very similar to the @xmath76-wave case in the two - dimensional setup that we consider here .",
    "therefore we have chosen to parametrize the discussion of the thermodynamic quantities by the harmonic oscillator frequency of the two - body interaction itself .",
    "one can then make the connection to a realistic system by working backwards through the model of busch _",
    "et al._.    our numerical results show that the low - temperature behavior reflects shell structure for the particle numbers we study .",
    "the large - temperature equipartition limits are recovered for energy and heat capacity , and the transition from small to large temperature is fastest for smaller two - body interaction strength . the qualitative behavior is rather similar for bosons and fermions .",
    "however , bosons always have a gap in the low - energy spectrum since one quantum of excitation of the relative motion must be antisymmetric and therefore forbidden .",
    "this leads to a slower variation with temperature , since this gap has to be overcome before the number of available states goes up .",
    "our results for the density of states turn out to scale with the number of relative excitation quanta in a manner that is very similar to the treatment of the many - body density of states for a uniform fermi gas .",
    "surprisingly , the bosonic many - body level density scales similarly to the fermionic one , although the particle number enters differently in our interpolation formulas .    in future studies it will be interesting to consider also multi - component systems , something which is simply done within the harmonic approach since the level counting can be factorized in the different components .",
    "also , a study of the virial expansion based on the harmonic approach is currently on - going , both in two and three dimensions .",
    "in addition , we note that one dimensional system have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their realization in ultracold atomic physics @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to test our prediction against some of the models that are being explored in the experiments and for which a number of exactly solvable many - body models are known @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments studying ultracold few - body two - component fermi systems ( particle numbers of ten or less ) @xcite would be an interesting comparison for the harmonic approximation .",
