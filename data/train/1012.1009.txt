    "the coupling of the electromagnetic field and matter can give rise to optical forces on otherwise neutral objects  @xcite , and optomechanical coupling via radiation pressure or gradient forces in nanophotonics has been the subject of numerous recent theoretical and experimental works  @xcite . for example , two identical ( symmetric ) waveguides or membranes can attract or repel depending on the phase and frequency with which they are excited  @xcite , and this prediction led to several experimental realizations  @xcite . here , we extend this concept to greater generality by demonstrating that tunable attractive and repulsive forces can also arise in highly asymmetric structures coupled to external radiation , combining a suspended holey membrane with an unpatterned layered substrate , forming two coupled planar waveguides as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "such asymmetric geometries have a clear advantage in ease of fabrication and experimental characterization compared to symmetric double - membrane structures ( in which two membranes must be both patterned and suspended ) .",
    "although our system is asymmetrical , repulsive / attractive forces can still be thought of as arising from the bonding / anti - bonding level repulsion of guided - wave resonances similar to the phenomenon studied in symmetric systems  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric case , however , it is more difficult to identify precisely which resonant modes of the large - separation ( isolated ) waveguides participate to produce a resonant force , especially at higher frequencies , since the absence of exact degeneracies means that many more modes can potentially interact . unlike symmetric systems , however , we can obtain bonding / antibonding forces that either increase or decrease with separation and more generally are nonmonotonic .",
    "we analyze the resonant forces from the perspective of perturbation theory . in unpatterned multilayer systems , we prove that only repulsive ( not attractive ) resonances can occur .",
    "although experimental characterization of forces in any membrane system requires accurate measurement of the membrane displacement , we point out that the transmission / reflection resonances of the membrane itself can be used as a sensitive position sensor .",
    "finally , in contrast to previous theoretical works that relied primarily on frequency - domain calculations , we propose a time - domain stress - tensor computational method that obtains the entire force spectrum from a single calculation via fourier transforms of a short pulse .    ) consisting of a square - lattice of air holes ( radius @xmath0 ) on silicon is suspended ( separation @xmath1 ) on top of an unpatterned ( homogeneous ) silicon slab ( thickness @xmath2 ) sitting on top of a semi - infinite silica substrate .",
    "light is incident on the membrane from the normal direction ( top ) . ]",
    "optical forces can arise due to radiation pressure or gradient forces  @xcite .",
    "radiation pressure can be thought of as exchange of momentum between a photon ( momentum @xmath3 ) and matter , and as a consequence it is easily seen that light with incident power @xmath4 exerts a force @xmath5 on a planar surface if the light is 100% absorbed or a force @xmath6 if it is 100% reflected . therefore , the ratio @xmath7 is a useful dimensionless measure of the strength of an optical force .",
    "gradient forces , as shown recently  @xcite , can arise from the evanescent interaction between localized optical modes , and the resonant increase in the field intensity greatly enhances the force for a given input power  @xcite , so that @xmath8 .",
    "such large forces enable strong , tunable optomechanical interactions  @xcite , which have applications such as optical cooling  @xcite , optical tweezers and traps  @xcite , and optical switches  @xcite .",
    "successful demonstrations of other prominent resonant optomechanical effects include coherent mechanical oscillation ( amplification ) of mesoscopic objects with long vibrational lifetimes , and demonstrations of the photon ",
    "phonon strong - coupling regime via dressed optical states  @xcite .",
    "we showed in  ref .",
    "@xcite that if two identical waveguides or resonant cavities are bought together , the mutual interaction of these ( degenerate ) resonances or guided modes can induce a splitting of the modes into pairs characterized by attractive and repulsive mechanical forces , analogous to the well - known bonding / anti - bonding states formed by the level splitting ( avoided crossings ) of interacting degenerate states in quantum systems  @xcite . in submicron - scale photonic devices ,",
    "these forces are strong enough to yield displacements and other mechanical effects that have been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the frequency and/or phase of the optical excitation can be controlled to yield tunable optomechanical effects , even switching the sign of the force from attractive to repulsive .",
    "there are two ways to induce repulsive and attractive interactions , depending on whether the incident power comes in the form of a guided mode or external radiation ( the focus of this paper ) .",
    "first , one can inject light parallel to the membranes / waveguides , exciting guided modes that propagate along the waveguides and interact evanescently . in this case , the sign of the interaction is controlled by the relative phase of the modes in the two waveguides  @xcite .",
    "a similar effect occurs by controlling the relative phase of two coupled cavities ( e.g. microspheres or microdisks ) , but in this case the bonding / anti - bonding resonances also have different frequencies that can be used to control the sign of the force  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to design asymmetric waveguide / cavity structures ( e.g. a dielectric waveguide and a microdisk resonator ) with repulsive and attractive interactions as long as both structures support propagating modes , again with light incident along the waveguide direction  @xcite .",
    "( coupled propagating modes in asymmetric geometries were also recently shown to lead to non - monotonic forces  @xcite . )",
    "second , one can shine light perpendicular to the membranes ; if the membranes are perforated by periodic holes ( or any other periodic modulation ) , normally incident radiation can couple via diffraction to guided - mode resonances within the membranes , which again couple evanescently . in this case , because the bonding / anti - bonding resonances have different frequencies , the sign of the force can be controlled by the frequency of the incident light .",
    "( by considering lateral shifts , one can also obtain lateral forces and other effects  @xcite . ) as the periodic modulation ( e.g. the hole radius ) is made smaller , the lifetime ( or quality factor @xmath9 ) of the guided - wave resonances increases  @xcite , the resonant fields become stronger ( intensity @xmath10 ) , and thus the resonant forces become stronger @xmath10 ( albeit narrower in bandwidth @xmath11 ) .",
    "this force enhancement is ultimately limited only by losses ( absorption or scattering from finite size or disorder ) .",
    "another limitation is that the narrow bandwidth translates into a sensitive dependence of the force on the separation of the two membranes ( since the resonant frequency shifts with separation ) .    as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , this paper considers the case of normal - incidence light on a suspended membrane , but in contrast to previous works , we only have a single suspended membrane ( e.g. silicon ) over a solid unpatterned substrate",
    ". the substrate must still support a guided mode of its own in order to obtain forces by evanescent coupling , and in our case this is achieved by a layered structure of a higher index layer on a lower - index substrate ( e.g. silicon on silica ) . as in previous works , the membrane is periodically patterned to couple resonantly with normal - incidence light , and thanks to evanescent coupling this periodicity is also sufficient to couple light to guided resonances in the unpatterned substrate . because the two waveguides in our case are so different , however , the interaction is more complicated than the degenerate level - splitting that occurs in symmetric systems , leading to nonmonotonic force dependences as well as transitions in the sign of the force .",
    "the separation and frequency dependence of the force in membrane structures has been previously exploited for achieving a variety of optomechanical effects . for example , one can obtain mechanical oscillators with dynamically tunable `` spring constants , '' even flipping the sign to yield an unstable equilibrium and mechanical bistability , with a tunable relative strength of the linear and nonlinear terms ( with arbitrarily strong relative nonlinearity possible if the linear term is canceled )  @xcite . here , we point out that by operating with light consisting of two frequencies , rather than a single frequency , one can tailor the spring constant of the membrane without changing its mechanical equilibrium separation .",
    "furthermore , we argue that , with appropriate design , it should be possible for repulsion to dynamically activate at small separations , creating a feedback mechanism for combating stiction arising from other forces ( e.g. electrostatic  @xcite or quantum  @xcite interactions ) .",
    "previous numerical methods for computing optical forces have mainly focused on frequency - domain approaches , with some exceptions  @xcite .",
    "given two objects separated by a distance @xmath12 , the force on one of the objects can be computed in one of at least two ways : one approach involves computing the derivative of the eigenfrequencies @xmath13 of two membranes separated by distance @xmath1 as a function of @xmath1 , which can be related to the force via the relation @xmath14",
    "@xcite , where @xmath15 corresponds to repulsion . ref .",
    "@xcite generalized this formula to handle the case of resonances with finite lifetimes @xmath16 , rigorously justifying our earlier suggestion  @xcite that the change in lifetime with separation has a negligible ( higher - order ) contribution to the force on resonance .",
    "this approach is problematic , however , in general circumstances where there may not be well - defined resonant modes with negligible loss , nor does it include cases where there is a superposition of the resonant mode with other waves ( e.g. light from an external source ) .",
    "another approach involves computing the force via an integral @xmath17 of the time - average maxwell stress tensor @xmath18\\ ] ] around some bounding surface @xmath19 lying in vacuum  @xcite . for resonant modes with negligible loss",
    ", @xmath20 can be computed directly from an eigenmode calculation  @xcite . more generally , including the case where the fields are excited from an external source",
    "whose effect must be included from some time - harmonic current source @xmath21 , one can solve a set of linear equations for the resulting time - harmonic fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 by a variety of methods ( e.g. finite elements or differences in the frequency domain , or transfer - matrix methods )  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix d ) , and use these fields to compute @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , has the drawback that if the force at many frequencies @xmath13 is desired , one must perform many separate calculations ( one for each @xmath13 ) .",
    "if a broad - band force spectrum is desired , an attractive alternative is to compute the stress tensor via the fourier transform of a short pulse in the time domain ( e.g. finite - difference time - domain , fdtd  @xcite ) , yielding the entire frequency spectrum at once . here",
    ", one simply evolves maxwell s equations in response to a pulse source [ e.g. @xmath25 in time , accumulating the discrete - time fourier - transform [ @xmath26 of both the electric @xmath22 and magnetic @xmath23 fields over the stress - tensor surface @xmath19 , and at all desired frequencies @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "these fourier - transformed fields then yield the stress tensor and hence the force . of course",
    ", the force must be normalized in some way , and here the dimensionless @xmath7 normalization is very convenient .",
    "one simply does a separate calculation , with no structure ( vacuum ) , to compute the fourier - transformed incident fields and hence the incident power @xmath27 . dividing @xmath28 yields the dimensionless force spectrum , where all arbitrary normalization factors ( e.g. the incident pulse spectrum or the normalization of the fourier transform ) have canceled .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] , along with possible applications and the underlying theory .",
    "we begin by considering two related membrane structures : the asymmetric structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , with a perforated silicon membrane over a silica substrate ; and also a symmetrized version consisting of two identical perforated silicon membranes , examined previously by  ref .  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the membranes are illuminated from above by normal - incident ( @xmath33 direction ) light polarized in the @xmath32 direction , and we consider the resonant frequencies and the resulting forces as a function of frequency and separation .    in the symmetric case , it is well known that each resonance of the individual membranes splits into two resonances of the coupled two - membrane system : `` bonding '' and `` anti - bonding '' modes , in which the individual resonances are excited in phase and out of phase , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of these two resonances as a function of membrane separation are shown as dashed lines in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , and as expected the frequency splitting vanishes as the separation increases ( and hence the membrane coupling decreases )  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath31 field patterns are shown as the right two insets of the left plot , and display the expected phases .",
    "each resonant mode corresponds to a resonant peak in the optical force , and this peak force ( at the resonant frequency ) is plotted as a function of separation as dashed lines in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . as expected , the bonding and anti - bonding modes correspond to opposite - sign attractive and repulsive forces between the membranes , respectively , and the force becomes stronger as the separation decreases ( increasing the membrane interactions ) .",
    "the attractive force in the bonding case has slightly larger magnitude than the anti - bonding repulsion , which can be explained by the larger field overlap in the former case due to the lack of a node in @xmath31 between the membranes  @xcite .    in the asymmetric case ,",
    "the mode of the isolated membrane is not the same frequency as the corresponding guided mode of the isolated layered - substrate structure ( although the parameters can be adjusted to force a degeneracy if desired ) .",
    "the mode of the silicon on silica ( oxide ) system is actually a lossless waveguide mode ( lifetime @xmath40 ) , not a resonance ; it is only when the membrane is brought into proximity with the oxide that the membrane s periodicity @xmath29 allows guided modes at wavevector @xmath41 ( and multiples thereof ) to couple to normal - incident radiation  @xcite . in this case , the layered - substrate ( waveguide ) mode that is nearest in frequency to the isolated - membrane resonance frequency is the lowest - order waveguide mode of wavevector @xmath41 . because the two mode frequencies are no longer degenerate , when the resonant frequencies of the asymmetric case are plotted versus separation as solid lines in the left part of fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] , the frequency splitting no longer vanishes as the separation increases .",
    "nevertheless , there is a frequency splitting or `` level repulsion , '' explained below in terms of second - order perturbation theory , which becomes significant for small separations , and the corresponding field patterns display the qualitative phase characteristics of bonding / anti - bonding modes ( insets ) . as a consequence ,",
    "as considered theoretically below , the force spectrum in the asymmetric case ( right , inset ) indeed displays the characteristic attractive and repulsive resonant peaks of bonding / anti - bonding modes . the peak force ( at resonance ) versus separation is plotted as solid lines in the right part of  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , and has similar sign as in the symmetric case . of course , the system is now more complicated than the symmetric case in a variety of ways ( e.g. the field patterns are no longer symmetrical / anti - symmetrical and the lifetimes as well as the frequencies depend strongly on separation ) , so the peak force versus separation dependence is significantly different : first , the peak bonding ( attractive ) force _ decreases _ as @xmath1 decreases and reaches a _ constant value _ as @xmath42 .",
    "second , the ratio of the antibonding ( repulsive ) to bonding force becomes increasingly larger at smaller separations ( e.g. it is more than a factor of 2 larger at @xmath43 ) , in contrast to what is normally observed  @xcite .    to understand these features of the force , we use the fact ( reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pert ] ) that the force is proportional to both the separation ( @xmath1 ) dependence @xmath44 of the frequency and also the lifetime @xmath9 .",
    "as discussed below , perturbation theory indicates that @xmath44 of a nondegenerate mode in one object decreases proportional to the square of its field overlap with the other object  @xcite . for a mode which as @xmath45 approaches a leaky mode of the perforated membrane  in our case , the antibonding mode  the lifetime @xmath9 asymptotes to a nonzero constant and hence the product @xmath46 ; correspondingly , the force tends exponentially to zero with @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the force must tend to zero for both the bonding and antibonding modes of a symmetric membrane ( where all modes are leaky as @xmath45 ) . on the other hand , for a mode that asymptotes as @xmath45 to a lossless guided mode of the unpatterned substrate  in this case , the bonding mode  the lifetime @xmath9 diverges as @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , perturbative scattering theory  @xcite indicates that the scattered power , and hence @xmath47  @xcite , is proportional to the square of the field overlap with the periodic membrane ( the source of the scattering loss ) .",
    "hence @xmath9 diverges at the _ same rate _ at which @xmath44 vanishes , and thus the force should asymptote to a nonzero constant as @xmath45 .",
    "these behaviors are precisely what is observed in  fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( right ) : the peak forces of the symmetric system and the asymmetric antibonding mode decrease monotonically to zero with increasing @xmath1 , while the peak force of the asymmetric bonding mode increases monotonically to a constant with increasing @xmath1 . the corresponding variation in @xmath9 is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] ( left ) . note that for @xmath48 , the @xmath9 of the antibonding mode increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath1 , leading to an increasing antibonding force that is many times larger than the corresponding bonding force . in a practical system ,",
    "the behavior of the bonding mode will be further modified by the presence of loss in the isolated - substrate guided mode ( from finite - size effects , roughness , absorption , etcetera)this will cause its @xmath9 to saturate to a finite value . in this case",
    ", the force will behave _ nonmonotonically _ : it will initially increase , but will then decrease to zero as @xmath1 goes beyond the saturation point of @xmath9 ( while @xmath44 continues to decrease ) .",
    "thus , the lifetimes of both the membrane and substrate could be exploited to tailor the @xmath1 dependence of the force in this and other similar systems .       on the single - membrane structure of fig .",

    "changing @xmath1 can move the system into or out of resonance , leading to a dramatic @xmath1-dependence of the force .",
    "( indeed , the @xmath1 dependence can be much sharper than shown here , e.g. if the hole diameter is shrunk to increase the @xmath9 of the resonances . )",
    "one can obtain transitions in the sign of the force , from attractive to repulsive and vice versa , as @xmath1 is varied , leading to stable and unstable equilibria , not yet including the mechanical restoring force from the membrane supports , and even multiple equilibria .    when mechanical forces are included",
    ", two things can happen .",
    "if the optical force is nonzero , the mechanical equilibrium point of the membrane will shift and the slope of the force curve ( the spring constant @xmath54 ) will be altered . if one operates at a point where the optical force is zero , then the equilibrium position is unaltered but the spring constant is changed .",
    "the total spring constant , including linear mechanical restoring forces on the membrane , will be given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the mechanical spring constant .",
    "whereas @xmath56 is frequency- and power - independent , @xmath57 exhibits a very sensitive dependence on both , and therefore by choosing @xmath13 and the incident power it is possible to tune the total spring constant of the system  @xcite . on the one hand ,",

    "note also that the resonant peaks in this frequency window approach one another as the separation _ decreases _ , which means that the largest contribution to level repulsion in this case is coming from interactions with other modes ( outside this frequency window , not shown ) ; this is verified by examining the field patterns ( upper insets ) , which clearly correspond to completely different modes in the membrane and not just a relative - phase change . as in sec .",

    "however , at large separations compared to the evanescent tail of the participating guided modes , evanescent bonding / anti - bonding effects lead to negligible force enhancement . on the other hand , there exists an alternative and complementary force - enhancement mechanism that can play a role at large separations : light normally incident on two separated planar objects can be resonantly enhanced due to the fabry ",

    "resonant radiation pressure within fabry  perot cavities has a long history , dating back to work in the 1960s on interferometer sensitivity  @xcite , and has since been considered both theoretically and experimentally for many applications  @xcite , such as nonreciprocal phenomena  @xcite , optical cooling  @xcite , and tunable optical springs  @xcite .",
    "if the space between two partially reflecting mirrors ( e.g. bragg mirrors ) is viewed as a waveguide , then the resonance frequency for normal - incident light corresponds to a slow - light ( zero group - velocity ) band edge where radiation pressure is enhanced  @xcite . in all of these cases ,",
    "the pressure is repulsive , as one might expect for light bouncing between the two objects ( and was argued in general for two semi - infinite objects  @xcite ) .",
    "we show this in general below , for radiating modes ( not guided modes ) and any unpatterned multi - layered structure ( in the absence of gain ) .    here",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] , consisting of two unpatterned ( translationally invariant in two directions ) planar multilayer objects separated by distance @xmath1 in vacuum , denoted as objects  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) , characterized by complex reflection / transmission amplitudes @xmath129 and @xmath130 at a given frequency , respectively ( satisfying @xmath131 in the absence of absorption or gain ) .",
    "the dimensionless force @xmath7 on object  ( 1 ) due to light normally incident from above at frequency @xmath13 can be readily computed ( using a simple transfer - matrix analysis to obtain the stress tensor  @xcite ) to be : @xmath132 where @xmath133 $ ] is the induced field at the lower interface of object ( 1 ) , and @xmath134 is the phase associated with the air gap .",
    "elementary manipulation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffb ] ) shows that the force is bounded above by @xmath135 , which is a bound on the attractive ( positive ) force .",
    "this result is a physical consequence of conservation of momentum : the light trapped between the objects can only act to repel them , whereas an attractive force can only arise from reflections from the uppermost surface .",
    "( the key difference compared to patterned membranes or guided modes is that the fields in between the objects are now purely propagating waves in which the field amplitude is proportional to the wave momentum  @xcite , with no evanescent component where these two quantities can be decoupled . ) the maximum reflectivity is  100% , corresponding to @xmath136 .",
    "a related situation is one in which the lower object plays no role because its reflectivity approaches zero . in this case , for @xmath137 and @xmath138 , one recovers a standard result for the force on a single object , @xmath139  @xcite , which is always positive ( attractive ) and is bounded above by  2 .",
    "( note , however , that all of these limits only apply in the absence of gain , which can alter the force by emitting additional photons from the objects  @xcite . ) on the other hand , the repulsive forces are unbounded , becoming arbitrarily large as @xmath140 and @xmath141 approach unity .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the repulsive pressure from the fabry ",
    "perot mode trapped between the objects , whose lifetime ( and energy density ) diverge in this limit .",
    "this familiar result has been exploited in many cavity - enhanced optomechanical systems as noted above .",
    "one can construct multilayer objects supporting exponentially localized resonances which couple to normally incident radiation .",
    "for example , this is the case if each object consists of a multilayer bragg mirror with an embedded defect layer  @xcite . in this case , degenerate perturbation theory implies that two symmetric objects [ such as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ]  ( right ) ] , each with an identical embedded defect / resonance , should couple to form bonding / anti - bonding states where the resonances are in / out - of phase .",
    "naively , one might suppose that this will lead to repulsive and attractive resonances , as in the coupled guided - mode case , but eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffb ] ) indicates that this is impossible .",
    "the explanation is straightforward : although such defect modes are exponentially localized within the bragg mirrors composing each object , they are propagating in the region between the objects where there are no mirrors ( because the input beam is propagating in free space and no diffraction occurs ) .",
    "this means that the frequency splitting does not depend exponentially on the separation between the two objects , and hence there is no resonant force enhancement via these modes , by the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : forces ] .",
    "optomechanical interactions are a rich subject of current research , and the use of evanescently coupled guided resonances enables an especially rich set of phenomena because of the presence of both attractive and repulsive resonances .",
    "the ability to tailor and exploit guided resonances coupled via periodic modulations offers an exciting opportunity to procure complicated force effects at small separations . in this paper",
    ", we showed that functionality similar to that of previously studied symmetric - membrane systems can be obtained in asymmetrical membrane - substrate structures . from an experimental point of view ,",
    "such asymmetrical structures are attractive in that only a single membrane need be suspended and patterned . from a theoretical viewpoint , because the resonant modes of asymmetrical structures need not come in degenerate pairs ( unless degeneracies are forced ) , more than one pair of modes can have strong interactions , leading to the possibility of richer force phenomena  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the distance dependence of a force spectrum with multiple attractive and repulsive resonances can exhibit richer `` optical spring '' phenomena than are possible with repulsive resonances alone ( as in fabry  perot resonances between mirrors ) ; for example , one can operate at a zero of the optical force to tune the optical spring constant ( in either direction ) without altering the equilibrium position .",
