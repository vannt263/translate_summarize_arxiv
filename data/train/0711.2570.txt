    "the large error bars primarily reflect the uncertainty in the distances .    the apparently overluminous behavior seen in sn 2006x in the tail phase",

    "the radial brightness profiles of the images of the sn and local stars in the same field ( see fig",

    "these were obtained by extracting the flux using different apertures , ranging from 0.1 to 10 pixels with a resolution of 0.1 pixel .",
    "the fluxes of the four local stars labeled in figure 1 are scaled so that the integrated flux within the 10-pixel aperture is the same .",
    "based on the distribution of the radial profiles of these four stars , we derived a mean radial profile with the same integrated flux through monte carlo simulations .",
    "the radial profile of the four stars was thus normalized by the peak flux of the simulated radial profile .",
    "one can see that the star profiles are uniform at large radius but show noticeable scatter within 2 pixels from the center . for comparison , the central flux of sn 2006x",
    "is scaled to be 1.0 , with the assumption that the central region of the sn image was not affected by any le . at @xmath15",
    "d the sn profile does not show a significant difference from that of the local stars . at @xmath16",
    "d the sn profiles appear distinctly broader at radii of 24 pixels , especially in the f435w and f555w images .",
    "note that the sn data are quite steep at around 1 pixel , probably due to noise .",
    "the inset plot of figure 3 shows the residual of the radial profile between sn 2006x and the local stars .",
    "this was obtained by subtracting the simulated radial profile of the stars from that of the sn .",
    "also plotted is the scatter of the simulated profile of the local stars . at @xmath16  d ,",
    "the sn shows significant extra flux in the f435w , f555w , and f775w filters at radii of @xmath02 to 5 pixels , suggesting the presence of a le .",
    "such a residual flux was not present at @xmath15  d.    one can see some structure ( peaks and valleys ) at @xmath32 pixels in the inset residual plot of figure 3 .",
    "these alternating negative / positive residuals clearly show that the substructure within the inner 2 pixels can not be trusted , and could result from the misalignment of the peak surface brightness of the images .",
    "of course , it is possible that part of the le is so close to the sn , but the above analysis can not definitively reveal it .    integrating the overall residual emission in the range 210 pixels , we find that the observed le brightness is @xmath022.8 mag in f435w , @xmath022.0 mag in f555w , and @xmath022.1 mag in f775w .",
    "its contribution to the total flux of the sn + le is @xmath029% in f435w , @xmath027% in f555w , and @xmath011% in f775w . in view of potential additional le emission at radii",
    "@xmath32 pixels , these values are probably lower limits to the true brightness of the le .",
    "although star 1 and sn 2006x show some diffraction spikes in figure 1 , the spikes have the same shape and orientation for all stars in the field .",
    "thus , ( a ) they should affect the radial surface brightness profiles of all stars in the same way , and not affect the excess light from an echo , and ( b ) they should be adequately removed by the image subtraction procedure (  3.3 ) .",
    "the difference between the radial profile of sn 2006x and other stars can also be demonstrated by their measured full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) .",
    "table 2 lists the fwhm of sn 2006x and the average value of several local stars , obtained by running the iraf `` imexamine '' task in three modes : @xmath30 ( radial profile gaussian fit ) , @xmath31 ( line 1d gaussian fit ) , and @xmath32 ( column 1d gaussian fit ) . at @xmath15  d ,",
    "the psf of sn 2006x is comparable to that of the average values of the local stars , while at @xmath16  d , the sn exhibits a significantly broader profile",
    ". the fwhm increases by about 0.3 pixel in the @xmath30-profile and by @xmath01.0 pixel in the @xmath31-profile and @xmath32-profile with respect to the local stars .",
    "the reasonable interpretation is that the psf is broadened by scattered radiation ( that is , the le ) .",
    "the radial - profile study suggests the presence of a le in sn 2006x . in this section",
    ", we apply image subtraction to provide further evidence for the le , and study its two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure .",
    "we extract a small section ( @xmath33 pixels ) centered on sn 2006x and star 1 ( the brightest star in the field ) , and align their peak pixels to high precision ( 0.01 pixel ) .",
    "we then scale star 1 so that its peak has the same counts as that of sn 2006x , and subtract it from the sn 2006x image .",
    "the underlying assumption is the same as in our radial - profile study : the central peak of sn 2006x is not affected by any le .",

    "hst_/acs resolution . to bring out more details ,",
    "the middle panel shows subsampled images by using a cubic spline function to interpolate one pixel into @xmath34 pixels .",
    "the right panel has three circles ( with radii of 2 , 4 , and 6 pixels , respectively ) overplotted .",
    "the residual images all show an extended , bright , ring - like feature around the supernova , consistent with the general expected appearance of a le .",
    "these features emerge primarily at radii of 24 pixels ( or @xmath35@xmath36 ) in the images , consistent with those derived above from the radial profiles .",
    "the central structure seen within a circle of radius 2 pixels ( e.g. , the asymmetric feature in f435w , the double features in f775w , and the arc in f555w ) are not to be trusted ; due to the limited spatial resolution , the images used for the image subtraction may not be perfectly aligned ( in terms of the geometry and/or the flux of the central regions ) , and some artifacts could be introduced at the center of the subtracted images .",
    "similarly , the apparent clumps within the echo ring are not reliable , generally being only a few pixels in size .",
    "the integrated flux , measured from the psf - subtracted images at 210 pixels from the sn site , contributes to the total flux of sn + le by @xmath033% in f435w , @xmath029% in f555w , and @xmath09% in f775w .",
    "this is fully consistent with the above estimate from the radial - profile analysis , taking into account the uncertainty in the psf subtraction .",
    "the brightness of the le component is estimated to be @xmath022.7 mag in f435w , @xmath021.9 mag in f555w , and @xmath022.3 mag in f775w .",
    "as with the radial - profile analysis , the psf - subtraction method might remove some fraction of flux from the le itself ; it had been assumed that none of the flux in the central 2-pixel radius is produced by the le , but this might be incorrect .",
    "thus , our estimate of the echo flux from the image analysis may be only a lower limit of the true le emission . in view of the image analysis",
    ", we can not verify or rule out that the le may be distributed continuously from the sn site to an angular radius of @xmath06 pixels ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "a consistency check for the existence of a le around a source can also be obtained by comparing the observed supernova spectrum and the synthetic spectrum using an echo model .",
    "the observed spectrum should be a combination of the intrinsic late - time sn spectrum and the early - time scattered sn spectrum .",
    "inspection of the late - epoch keck spectrum ( see fig . 19 of w07 ) clearly reveals that sn 2006x behaves unlike a normal sn  ia , showing a rather blue continuum at short wavelengths and a broad absorption feature near 6100  (probably due to si  ii @xmath386355 ) .    to construct the composite spectrum containing the echo component",
    ", we use the nebular - phase spectrum of sn 1996x to approximate that of sn 2006x .",

    ", we found that the overall spectral slope changed little during this period .",
    "we thus could extrapolate the original nebular spectra @xmath16  d , a phase when both sne have relatively good multicolor photometry . to completely match the spectrum of sn 2006x ,",
    "the spectral flux of sn 1996x was multiplied by a factor of 3.0 caused by the difference in distances .",
    "extinction corrections have also been applied to the nebular spectra of these two sne ( w07 ; wang et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we considered the cases of both sn 2006x and sn 1996x as the central pulse source when deriving the echo spectrum .",
    "the observed spectra of sn 2006x are available at eleven different epochs from about @xmath431  d to 75  d after @xmath7 maximum , while 14 spectra of sn 1996x are available from about @xmath434  d to 87  d after @xmath7 maximum ( salvo et  al . 2001 ) .",
    "the above spectra were properly dereddened and interpolated to achieve uniform phase coverage .",
    "regardless of the original flux calibration , all of the input spectra have been recalibrated according to their light curves at comparable phases ( w07 ; salvo et  al .",
    "2001 ) and corrected for the effects of scattering using a similar function , @xmath44 ( e.g. , suntzeff et  al . 1988",
    "; cappellaro et  al .",
    "these corrected spectra were then coadded and scaled , together with the nebular spectrum of sn 1996x , to match the nebular spectrum of sn 2006x .",

    "one can see that the combination of sn 2006x + sn 1996x gives a somewhat better fit to the observed spectrum of sn 2006x .",
    "this is not surprising ; the spectrum of sn 2006x differs from that of a normal sn  ia at early times , showing extremely broad and blueshifted absorption minima ( w07 ) .",
    "the large value of @xmath45 may indicate a small grain size for the scattering dust . the composite nebular spectrum and the underlying echo spectrum are compared with the observed spectrum of sn 2006x in figure 5 ( upper and middle panels ) . given the simple assumption of the scattering function , incomplete spectral coverage , and intrinsic spectral difference between sn 1996x and sn 2006x , the agreement between the observation and the model is satisfactory , with major features in the spectrum well matched .",
    "this provides independent , strong evidence for the le scenario .",
    "however , the broad emission peak seen at @xmath484500    can not be reasonably fit by the echo model ( see fig .",
    "5 ) ; this mismatch is probably produced by intrinsic features in the nebular spectrum of sn 2006x .",
    "we can constrain the properties of the le and the underlying dust through the luminosity and colors of the le .",
    "the le luminosity of sn 2006x has been estimated by analyzing the _ hst _ sn images ; it can also be obtained by integrating the echo spectrum shown in figure 5 .",
    "the magnitudes of the echo given by different methods are listed in table 3 .",
    "for the image - based measurement , the error accounts only for the scatter of the stellar psf . on the other hand , for the spectrum - based measurement",
    ", the error primarily consists of the uncertainties in extinction correction ( i.e. , @xmath00.2 mag for sn 2006x and @xmath00.1 mag for sn 1996x in the @xmath7 band ) and distance modulus ( i.e. , @xmath00.14 mag for sn 2006x and @xmath00.15 mag for sn 1996x ) .",
    "we note that the echo inferred from the spectral fitting seems somewhat brighter than that revealed by the image analysis : @xmath49 mag .",
    "this difference is also demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure 5 , where the flux ratio of the inferred echo spectrum and the observed spectrum of sn 2006x is plotted as a function of wavelength .",
    "overplotted are the ratios yielded for the photometry of the echo image ( circles ) and the spectrophotometry of the echo spectrum ( squares ) in f435w and f555w , respectively .",
    "such a discrepancy , at a confidence level of only @xmath50 , may suggest that there is some echo emission within a radius of 2 pixels ( 21% @xmath28 12% of the total flux of sn + le in f435w and 17% @xmath28 11% in f555w ) that was not resolved by the image analysis . despite this possibility",
    ", we must point out that the echo luminosity derived from the echo spectrum may have an error that is actually larger than our estimate , since we did not consider possible uncertainties associated with the spectrum itself and the simple scattering model adopted in our analysis ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "assuming that all of the observed differences between the light curves and spectra of sn 2006x and sn 1996x at @xmath16  d are entirely due to the le around sn 2006x , we can place an upper limit on the le brightness as @xmath51 mag in f435w and @xmath52 mag in f555w .",
    "the magnitudes and the resulting color are not inconsistent with those presented in table 3 , especially in the case of the spectral fit which likely takes into account most of the echo emission .",
    "this leaves little room for other possible mechanisms for the extra emission , suggesting that the echo is the primary cause of the abnormal overluminosity of sn 2006x at @xmath16  d.    we find , from analysis of both the _ hst _ images and the nebular spectrum ( see table 3 ) , that the le has an average color ( f435w  f555w)@xmath53 = @xmath54 mag ( this roughly equals @xmath55 = @xmath54 mag ) , which is much bluer than the sn color at maximum brightness . the le is clearly brighter in bluer passbands than at redder wavelengths ( see fig .",
    "comparing the colors of the echo and the underlying sn light helps us interpret the dust , as the color shift depends on the scattering coefficient and hence on the dimensions of the dust grains ( sugerman 2003a ) .    integrating over the entire sn light curve ( w07 ) from about @xmath4311  d to 116  d after @xmath7 maximum yields @xmath56 mag for the overall emission of sn 2006x . the observed change in color ,",
    "@xmath57 mag , is much larger than the color shift derived for galactic dust but is comparable to the change derived for rayleighan dustm , and hence has a scattering efficiency proportional to @xmath58 ( sugerman 2003a ) . ] , @xmath59 mag ( sugerman et  al .",
    "this is consistent with constraints from the direct spectral fit , which suggests that the dust has a scattering efficiency proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "we thus propose that the dust surrounding sn 2006x is different from that of the galaxy and may have small - size grains , perhaps with diameter @xmath61 m , reflecting the shorter wavelengths of light more effectively .",
    "smaller dust particles are also consistent with the low value of @xmath62 derived by w07 .      of interest",
    "is the distribution of the dust producing the echo ; for example , it may be a plane - parallel dust slab or a spherical dust shell .",
    "couderc ( 1939 ) was the first to correctly interpret the le ring observed around nova persei 1901 .",
    "detailed descriptions of le geometries can also be found in more recent papers ( e.g. , sugerman 2003a ; tylenda et  al .",
    "2004 ; patat 2005 ) .",
    "in general , the analytical treatment shows that both a dust slab and a dust shell could produce an echo that is a circular ring containing the source . assuming that the sn light is an instantaneous pulse ,",
    "then the geometry of an le is straightforward : the distance of the illuminated dust material lying on the paraboloid can be approximated as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the distance from the sn to the observer , @xmath65 is the angular radius of the echo , @xmath66 is the speed of light , and @xmath67 is the time since the outburst .",
    "the equation with a minus sign corresponds to the single dust slab , while the plus sign represents the case for a dust shell .",
    "as suggested by the analysis of the radial profile and the psf - subtracted image of the sn , there is a confirmed le ring @xmath68 away from the sn , with a possible width of @xmath69 . for this echo of sn 2006x , @xmath70 = 0.27 pc , which leads to @xmath71 @xmath17 27120 pc , consistent with the scale of the ism dust cloud . as the dust cloud in front of sn 2006x seems to be very extended",
    ", we do not give the thickness of the dust along the line of sight .",

    "3 ) , the actual distribution of the dust may be from @xmath327  pc to @xmath0170  pc from the sn .    in principle , one can also estimate the distance of the dust itself from the sn through a fit to the observed echo luminosity using the light - echo model ( e.g. , cappellaro et  al . 2001 ) , as the actual echo flux is related to the light emitted by the sn , the physical nature of the dust , and the dust geometry .",
    "however , current analytical treatments for the le model must assume some idealized configuration , which may not apply to the dust surrounding sn 2006x that is found to probably have smaller dust grains with @xmath73 and a relatively extended distribution .",
    "moreover , multiple scattering processes rather than a single scattering should be considered in the echo model due to the large optical depth measured from the dust : @xmath74 for sn 2006x .",
    "detailed modelling of the le emission seen in sn 2006x is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "analysis of both the late - time _",
    "hst _ images and",
    "the late - time keck optical spectrum favors the presence of a le in sn 2006x , the fourth non - historical sn  ia with a detection of echo emission .",
    "comparison of the sn 2006x echo with the other three known events , sne 1991 t , 1995e , and 1998bu , shows that the type ia echoes may have a wide range of dust distances from @xmath75 10 pc to @xmath0 210 pc . the echo detected in sn",
    "1991 t is consistent with being a dust cloud of radius 50 pc ( sparks et  al .",
    "1999 ) , while the echo speculated from sn 1995e probably corresponds to a dust sheet at a distance of @xmath76 pc ( quinn et  al .",
    "garnavich et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed from the _ hst _ wfpc2 imaging that sn 1998bu may have two echoes , caused by dust at @xmath77 pc and @xmath78 pc away from the sn ; the outer echo is consistent with an ism dust sheet , while the inner component is likely from the csm dust . on the other hand ,",
    "the resolved echo image of sn 2006x appears quite extended in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "this yields a dust distance spanning from @xmath0 27 pc to @xmath0 170 pc away from the site of the sn , indicating that the dust causing the le may not be a thin dust sheet but could be a cloud or shell distribution of the dust around the progenitor or a more complicated dust system .",
    "the echo from sn 2006x is found to be brighter than that of the other three type ia echo events .",
    "assuming the echo magnitude listed in table 3 and the sn peak magnitude derived in w07 , one can find that the echo flux with respect to the extinction - corrected peak magnitude of sn 2006x is @xmath09.6 mag in @xmath19 .",
    "quinn et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed that all of the other three type ia echoes ( sne 1991 t , 1995e , 1998bu ) show a striking similarity in their echo brightness relative to the extinction - corrected peak sn brightness , @xmath79 mag .",
    "according to the analytical expression of the dust scattering ( e.g. , patat 2005 ) , the excess echo brightness from sn 2006x by @xmath01 mag perhaps suggests a dust distribution closer to the sn , given the similar optical depth for sne 2006x and 1995e .",
    "the sn 2006x echo emission also shows a prominent wavelength dependence , with more light from the shorter wavelengths , suggestive of smaller - size dust around sn 2006x .",
    "this is also demonstrated by the difference of the scattering coefficient @xmath45 required to fit the observed nebular spectrum , which is @xmath03.0 for sn 2006x , @xmath02.0 for 1991 t",
    "( schmidt et  al . 1994 ) , and @xmath01.0 for sn 1998bu ( cappellaro et  al .",
    "2001 ) .    in fitting the nebular spectrum ,",
    "the echo brightness is found to be @xmath0 60% brighter than that from the echo image at the @xmath02@xmath2 level , likely suggesting the presence of a local echo that was not resolved at the regions close to the sn site . regarding the location of the echo emission in sn 2006x ,",
    "one may naturally tie the distribution of the dust underlying the echo to a combination of local csm dust and distant ism dust , given the quite extended dust distribution and the small dust grains that were not typical for the ism dust .",
    "detection of the csm dust is of particular importance for understanding sn  ia progenitor models .",
    "p07 recently reported the detection of csm in sn 2006x from variable na  i  d lines , and they estimate that the absorbing dust is a few @xmath80 cm from the sn .",
    "it is hence expected that an echo very close to the sn ( @xmath30.01  pc away ) should be produced , although the sn uv radiation field could destroy or change the distribution of the surrounding dust particles out to a radius of a few @xmath81 cm ( dwek 1983 ) .",
    "however , it is not possible for us to detect the emission of such a close csm echo at @xmath16  d , since the maximum delayed travel time of the light for this echo is @xmath30.1  yr and the sn radiation decreases with time .    as noted by w07 , the spectrum of sn 2006x probably showed a uv excess at @xmath82  d. this may be a signature of the nearby csm claimed by p07 , but the s / n of the spectrum is quite low below 4000   . in this case , the possible echo emission at @xmath327  pc inferred from the nebular spectrum at @xmath16  d could result from a dust shell that is farther out than that claimed by p07 .",
    "this is possible if the csm dust around sn 2006x has multiple shells , such as the dust ring ( or shell ) of a planetary nebula ( wang 2005 ) and nova - like shells .",
    "the presence of a local echo helps explain the slow decline of the @xmath7-band light curve of sn 2006x at early phases .",
    "nevertheless , the local echo ( if present ) is not necessarily from the csm dust , as forward scattering from the distant dust cloud in front of the sn could also produce an echo of very small angular size . to further distinguish between the two possible cases of distant ism plus local dust and single ism dust , future _ hst _ observations of sn 2006x are necessary .",
    "more late - phase _",
    "hst_/acs images would help constrain the evolution of the le .",
    "using equation ( 1 ) , we can predict the evolution of the echo ring with time .",
    "if the dust formed as a result of past mass loss from the central source , the echo will be more symmetric and the expansion will slow down after the initially rapid phase ; with time , its size will eventually shrink to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dust is of interstellar origin , the echo should expand continuously with slowly decreasing brightness as more - distant regions are illuminated . assuming that the inner component of the echo within 2 pixels is caused by a csm dust shell @xmath01  pc from the sn , then the emission within 2 pixels will finally decrease to zero at @xmath83  yr .",
    "in contrast , the local echo from distant ism dust should remain nearly constant for a longer time .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the recent nearby sne  ia , sn 2007gi ( cbet 1017 , cbet 1021 ) , sn 2007le ( cbet 1100 , cbet 1101 ) , and probably sn 2007sr ( cbet 1172,1174 , atel 1343 ) , may exhibit high - velocity features in their spectra similar to those of sn 2006x .",
    "if the sn 2006x - like events preferentially occur in environments with abundant ism dust or csm dust ( wang et  al .",
    "2008 , in prep . ) , then we might expect to detect late - time echo emission in the above three sne  ia .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to obtain future high - resolution _ hst_/acs images of these sne .",
    "the emergence of a le in sn 2006x has been confirmed with psf - subtracted _ hst _ acs images which show a ring - like , but rather extended , echo 25 pixels ( @xmath35@xmath84 ) from the sn site at @xmath16  d past maximum brightness .",
    "a keck nebular spectrum of the sn taken at a similar phase provides additional evidence for the le scenario ; it can be decomposed into a nebular spectrum of a normal sn  ia and a reflection spectrum consisting of the sn light emitted at early phases .    from the resolved echo image",
    ", we derive that the intervening dust is @xmath027170  pc from the supernova .",
    "based on the quite blue color of the echo , we suggest that the mean grain size of the scattering dust is substantially smaller than galactic dust .",
    "smaller dust particles are also consistent with the low @xmath85 value obtained from the sn photometry .",
    "our detection of a le in sn 2006x confirms that this sn  ia occurred in a dusty environment with atypical dust properties , as suggested by the photometry ( w07 ) .",
    "analysis of the nebular spectrum might also suggest a local echo at @xmath327 pc ( or at @xmath32 pixels ) that is not resolved in the psf - subtracted image .",
    "this possible local echo is likely associated with the csm dust produced by the progenitors , though detailed modeling of the echo spectrum and/or further high - resolution imaging are required to test for the other possibilities , such as very forward scattering by a distant cloud or csm - ejecta interaction .",
