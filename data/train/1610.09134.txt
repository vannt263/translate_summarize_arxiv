    "many stars in our galaxy form binary or multiple systems . @xcite noted that for solar - type ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) main sequence stars , the multiple frequency can reach 44% .",
    "furthermore , many planets have been found in binary or multiple systems such as @xmath6 botis ab @xcite , kepler-16 ( ab ) b @xcite , and roxs 42bb @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that at least 12% of planet - hosting stars may be binary or multiple systems , whereas @xcite estimated this value to be 23% , and @xcite very optimistically estimated that approximately @xmath7@xmath8 planet - hosting stars are binary stars .",
    "this begs the question of how planets form and evolve in binary or multiple systems .",
    "in addition , the proportion of young stars in binary or multiple systems appears to be two times higher that for solar - type field stars @xcite .",
    "this may imply that stars tend to form from binary or multiple systems .",
    "furthermore , this indicates that even planets discovered around single stars may have been affected by companion stars during their formation and evolution .",
    "therefore , to understand the early stages of the planet formation process , research on planets and disks around binary or multiple systems is necessary .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have demonstrated that the efficiency of planet formation in wide - separation ( @xmath9100 au ) binaries is not very different from their single star analogs . on the other hand , disks in smaller - separation binaries ( @xmath3100 au )",
    "may be too disturbed by the companion s gravity and too short - lived to produce planets @xcite . despite this fact , some planets have been discovered in close binaries .",
    "for example , s - type planets , which are planets that orbit around one of the binary stars , have been found in binaries with separations of approximately 20 au ( e.g. , @xmath10 cep ab @xcite ) , and p - type planets , which are planets that orbit around both binary stars , have been found in binaries with separations of approximately 0.22 au ( e.g. , kepler-16 ( ab)-b @xcite ) . in a census of a star formation region , @xcite determined that although approximately 2/3 of the close binaries with a separation of @xmath3 40 au lose their disks within approximately 1 myr , the remainder of approximately 1/3 of the disks appear to experience an evolutionary timescale similar to that of disks around single stars ; thus , planets may have opportunities to form in binary systems .",
    "these results indicate that some mechanism may help planets form in such close binaries .",
    "some theories suggest that an additional star might have helped the planet formation process , such as changing the orbit of a planet through the kozai ",
    "lidov mechanism @xcite , causing the protoplanetary disks to become eccentric by truncating them ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or opening large gaps in circumbinary disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the planet formation process around binaries could be quite different from and more complicated than that around single stars . to obtain a better understanding of this ,",
    "it is necessary to investigate disk structures in binaries to determine how the disks in binary systems evolve .",
    "gg tau is a well - known young multiple star system in the taurus  auriga molecular cloud at a distance of approximately 140 pc from the solar system @xcite .",
    "this is a double binary system : gg tau aa / ab and gg tau ba / bb . gg tau a is an eccentric ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) t tauri binary system with an age of approximately 2.3 myr @xcite .",
    "it consists of gg tau aa ( @xmath12 ) and gg tau ab ( @xmath13 ) with a separation of approximately 0.25@xmath1 ( 35 au ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported that gg tau ab is a binary with a separation of approximately 0.03@xmath1 ( 4.2 au ) and a period of approximately 16 yr ; thus , this system is actually a triple system , though it may still be regarded as a binary system in observations with 0.07@xmath1 resolution .",
    "the gg tau a system is noteworthy for its circumbinary ring , which was first discovered by ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging @xcite and has been observed many times in various wavelengths , e.g. , @xcite in the millimeter band , @xcite in the optical band , and @xcite in the nir band .",
    "millimeter and submillimeter observations @xcite have shown that this ring rotates clockwise and the northern edge is nearest to us . additionally , a gap has been observed in the northwestern region of the ring ; e.g. , @xcite observed it in 1998 with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer installed on the hubble space telescope ( hst / nicmos ) , and @xcite observed it in 1997 with the wide field and planetary camera 2 installed on the hubble space telescope ( hst / wfpc2 ) .",
    "this gap is believed to be a shadow cast by circumstellar materials @xcite .",
    "several groups have investigated the disk structure inside the circumbinary ring of gg tau a. @xcite suggested the possible ( @xmath14 ) existence of a streamer extending from the northeastern edge of the outer ring to the inner disk based on the observations from the iram plateau de bure interferometer in a 1.1 mm continuum band .",
    "@xcite observed the h@xmath15 emission around the stars using the gemini north telescope , arguing that the strong emissions around the disk are likely caused not by x - ray excitation but by shock waves due to an accretion flow in the disk .",
    "@xcite detected a feature in their observations of the gas in co j=65 transition by the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) implying the presence of streamers and speculated that the streamer may feed material from the outer region of the disk to a planet , sustaining planet formation .",
    "these studies strongly indicate that the region inside the circumbinary disk may not have been cleared yet , but they have not revealed the detailed structure of this region because of their low spatial resolution . investigating the details inside the circumbinary ring will be quite helpful in improving our understanding of planet formation in this system ; thus , it is very important to observe this region around gg tau a with a higher spatial resolution in the nir band . in the past studies ,",
    "high - spatial - resolution nir observations have helped to reveal the structures around the binary system sr24 @xcite , and it is thus a promising method for improving our understanding of disk structures .",
    "this paper discusses the successful observation of the detailed structures inside the circumbinary ring around gg tau a , which shows a `` north arc '' structure in the h - band that is believed to be part of a streamer flowing from the circumbinary ring to gg tau ab . in section 2 ,",
    "the observation and data reduction processes are introduced .",
    "section 3 presents the observation results of gg tau a. in section 4 , we compare the observations made in this study with theory and previous observations .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the presently reported observation of gg tau a was performed on 8 january 2015 hawaii standard time using the subaru 8.2 m telescope with the high contrast instrument for the subaru next generation adaptive optics ( hiciao ; @xcite ) and the adaptive optics ( ao ) instrument ao188 @xcite .",
    "this observation was part of the survey program strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru ( seeds ) , which began in 2009 .",
    "this observation employed the quad - polarized differential imaging ( qpdi ) mode , which uses a double - wollaston prism to split the light into four @xmath16 channels on the detector with pixel scale of 9.50 mas / pixel . to help reduce the saturated radius , two of these four channels each corresponded to o- and e - polarizations . during this observation ,",
    "the ao system limited the full width at half maximum of the stellar point spread function to 0.07@xmath1 , which is close to the diffraction limit of 0.04@xmath1 . in a previous observation of gg tau",
    "a by @xcite in 2011 , a mask with a 0.6@xmath1 diameter was used to obscure structures near the stars . to help reveal the inner region of the disk ,",
    "no mask was used in the present observation .",
    "a half - wave plate was used in the observation , and it was rotated among position angles of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 to measure the stokes parameters .",
    "this cycle was repeated 15 times during observation . ultimately , 60 frames were collected , each with an exposure time of 5 s and 4 coadds .",
    "the total integration time was 20 minutes .",
    "the data reduction process was completed using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) pipeline .",
    "flat field was corrected , and stripes , bad pixels , and distortions were removed . after these steps , the images were first cross - correlated in different channels .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 were then obtained by subtracting the e - images from the o - images .",
    "next , these stokes images were aligned , and the @xmath25 and @xmath26 images were constructed as @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the stokes @xmath29 image , or intensity image , was derived by averaging the sum of the o- and e- images in all frames .",
    "after the instrumental polarization was corrected , a polarized intensity ( @xmath30 ) image was constructed as @xmath31 . the uncorrected point spread function ( psf ) halo can disturb the polarization vectors ; thus",
    ", measures were taken to remove it ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "because the psf reference star was not obtained during the observation , it was difficult to remove the psf from the stokes @xmath29 image , which is actually a mixture of the total intensity image of the disk and the much brighter psf of the binary .",
    "therefore , the total intensity image as well as the polarization degree image ( @xmath32 image ) of the disk could not be derived , and the present discussion will be mainly based on the @xmath30 image rather than the @xmath32 image .",
    "the @xmath30 image tracing the light scattered by the dust grains of gg tau a is shown in figure 1 , which provides a wide view of gg tau a and its disk .",
    "the field of view is @xmath16 pixels , corresponding to approximately @xmath33 .",
    "this image shows the circumbinary ring , the two companion stars gg tau",
    "aa / ab and some disk structures near them .",
    "polarimetry observation is a powerful method of revealing circumstellar disk structures because it traces the polarized light scattered from the disks .",
    "the nonpolarized light from the central stars is subtracted during data reduction .",
    "however , it should also be noted that a lack of polarized light does not necessarily mean that there is no scattered light or scattering structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the present discussion , the part of the disk inside the circumbinary ring is defined as the `` inner region '' of the circumbinary disk around gg tau a.    the separation between the two companion stars was derived as 0.27@xmath34 , which corresponds to 38@xmath351 au .",
    "the position angle ( pa ) of gg tau aa / ab binary is @xmath36 ( measured from north to east ) .",
    "the gg tau ab binary reported by @xcite could not be resolved .    in the @xmath30 image",
    ", the circumbinary ring looks asymmetric .",
    "there seem to be offsets among the center of the outer edge ellipse , that of the inner edge ellipse , and the barycenter of the binary .",
    "to estimate the basic parameters of the circumbinary ring , we developed a toy model . in this model",
    ", we assumed the outer edge of the ring to be circular , the inclination @xmath37 , and the pa i@xmath38 , as in the previous observations .",
    "in addition , we attributed the barycenter of the binary to be near one of the foci of the inner edge ellipse . the result is shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "it was determined that the inner edge can be generally fitted by an ellipse with an eccentricity of approximately 0.2 and there are offsets among the center of the inner edge ellipse , that of the outer edge ellipse , and the barycenter of the gg tau a binary .",
    "the center of the inner edge ( yellow cross ) is located approximately 15 pixels ( 0.14@xmath1 or 20 au ) to the south of the barycenter , which should be near one of the foci of the inner edge ( yellow star ) , and that of the outer ring ( red cross ) is approximately 25 pixels ( 0.24@xmath1 or 33 au ) to the south of the center of the inner edge .",
    "this reveals the asymmetric characteristics of the circumbinary ring and that the binary is much closer to the north side of the circumbinary ring .",
    "in addition , some have suggested that the gap in the northwestern edge of the circumbinary ring , which can also be seen in figure 1(a ) and ( b ) as darker areas , is a shadow cast by some circumstellar materials @xcite . however , none of the inner disk structures discovered in this study appear to be responsible for it , and thus the origin of this gap remains unknown .",
    "both stars in the @xmath30 image are surrounded by bright nebula - like structures with radii of approximately 0.14@xmath1 ( 20.0 au ) and 0.10@xmath1 ( 13 au ) for gg tau aa and gg tau ab , respectively .",
    "these nebula - like structures look like circumstellar disks around each stars , but they could also be dominated by speckles . to help distinguish between speckles and real disk structures in the inner region , a vector map of the @xmath30 image was constructed .",
    "the fact that some vectors show centrosymmetric characteristics surrounding the central stars implies the presence of real disk structures .",
    "it is much more difficult to judge what the noncentrosymmetric vectors imply at this stage ; thus , we will leave discussions on such vectors to the future study .",
    "the vector maps centered on gg tau aa with sizes of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are shown in figures 2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively , where the white bars show the polarization angles ( pas ) .",
    "we calculated pas @xmath41 using the formula @xmath42 with binned data of 7 and 3 pixels for figures 2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the errors of the pas were estimated from the noise of the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "the typical error of the pas was approximately @xmath43 for the circumbinary ring , and that for the inner region of the disk was approximately @xmath44 .",
    "the vectors in the bright nebula - like structures around both stars do not show centrosymmetric characteristics , which may indicate that these bright nebular appearances are dominated by speckles .",
    "however , the vectors to the north of gg tau ab show a region with obvious centrosymmetry , extending approximately 0.40@xmath1 ( 56 au ) to the north of gg tau ab with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of larger than approximately @xmath45 . the brightest part in this region could have an snr of approximately @xmath46 . here",
    ", the snrs of the @xmath30 image were calculated from the snrs of the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "therefore , this area shows a real structure that may correspond to the north arc reported by @xcite .",
    "we refer it hereafter as `` the north arc '' .",
    "its inner side appears to be close to 0.10@xmath1 from gg tau ab and to connect the two `` bridges '' mentioned by @xcite , which are barely noticeable in this image .",
    "the eastern bridge has an snr of approximately @xmath47 , indicating it may be real . on the other hand ,",
    "the western bridge has an snr of only approximately @xmath48 ; therefore , the detection of this bridge remains uncertain . in the southern part of the inner disk , such obvious disk structures were not observed .",
    "this overall feature suggests that the inner region may be asymmetric .",
    "the vectors outside the bright structures in gg tau aa , especially vectors to the northeast of the star , tend to be centrosymmetric , which indicates that part of the disk structures around gg tau aa were captured in this image .",
    "the outermost boundary appears to extend to approximately 0.20@xmath1 ( 28 au ) in projection .",
    "this is slightly larger than but still in fair agreement with the radius of approximately 20 au previously reported for the circumstellar disk of gg tau aa ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "no such circumstellar structures are discernible in the present image of gg tau ab .",
    "based on the speckle radius of gg tau ab , the radius of the disk structure around the gg tau ab1/ab2 binary is constrained to < 13 au .    the bright structure between the two stars indicated in figure 2 appears to be connected , but the vectors are not centrosymmetric . considering",
    "the possible complexity of the polarization pattern between two stars , it is still unclear whether this structure is real or simply speckles .",
    "observations in other bands could be helpful in improving our understanding of this potential structure .",
    "according to @xcite , the semi - major axis ( sma ) of the gg tau a binary could be either 32 or 62 au .",
    "strict fitting of the astrometric data yielded an sma of 32 au .",
    "however , a binary with such a small sma could not open such a large gap in the circumbinary disk .",
    "another attempt taking into larger error bars of the astrometric data gave sma = 62 au that could fit the size of the ring but had a significance of only @xmath48 .",
    "they concluded that the disk and the binary were likely to be coplanar but the astrometric data errors were underestimated .",
    "@xcite noted that not only the underestimation of astrometric data errors but also the misalignment of the binary orbit plane and disk could be responsible for the discrepancy between the astrometric data and the ring size .    we compared present binary position with the observation performed by @xcite in late 2009 , approximately five years prior to the observation considered in this study .",
    "the pa was found to have changed by approximately @xmath49 over that time . in the study by @xcite , both the 32- and 62-au models",
    "have a pa rate of approximately @xmath50 , which is consistent with the present results .",
    "however , in this case , the sma of the binary could not be constrained using only astrometry .",
    "thus , the binary orbit was constrained using the disk structure model .",
    "@xcite developed a formula relating the radius of the density peak in the circumbinary disk to the sma and eccentricity of the binary orbit : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the eccentricity and sma of the binary , respectively , and @xmath54 is the radius of the density peak in the disk .",
    "first , we attempted to constrain the sma from the surface brightness peak and the density peak locations . for both @xmath55 au and @xmath56 au ( with an eccentricity of @xmath57 ) the locations of the surface density peak are 130 and 260 au , respectvitly , using the equation by @xcite .",
    "both numbers did not coincide with that of the surface brightness peak at 180 au .",
    "the surface brightness and surface density are likely to peak at different radii because the former is sensitive primarily to the disk shape and less sensitive to the density .",
    "therefore we concluded that the surface density peak lies outside the peak of the surface brightness since scattering is likely dominated by the material closest to the inner cavity where the illumination comes directly from the stars .",
    "this favors the @xmath58 au solution for the binary sma .",
    "the binary orbit could also affect the circumstellar disk around both stars . in the simulation performed by @xcite",
    ", they determined that for @xmath59 au and @xmath60 , the circumstellar disks around the companion stars should be approximately 13 au .",
    "it is expected that if @xmath56 au , the disk radius should be larger than 13 au , whereas if @xmath55 au , the disk radius is much smaller than 13 au . in the simulation performed by @xcite",
    ", they demonstrated that a binary with @xmath56 au and @xmath60 should have a circumstellar disk radius equal to 10 au , whereas this radius is only 4 au for @xmath55 au . in the present observation ,",
    "a possible disk structure was detected around gg tau aa extending to a projected distance of approximately 28 au , and @xcite noted that the circumstellar disk should have a radius on the order of approximately 20 au . both of these results suggest that gg tau aa has a relatively large disk .",
    "although it has not been definitively determeined whether the circumbinary ring and the binary are misaligned , the results of the present study indicate that @xmath56 au is more likely than @xmath55 au .",
    "the observations made in this study provided the first high - resolution image of the inner region around gg tau a. generally , it appears to be asymmetric .",
    "an arc structure was detected north of gg tau ab ; however , no such large disk - related feture was detected in the southern part .",
    "one would expect a binary comprising two stars with almost the same mass have a symmetric disk structures . to better understand the structure in the inner region",
    ", we compare the present observations with theory and previous observations , especially regarding co gas and dust continuum emissions .",
    "@xcite calculated the accretion of binary black holes in circular orbits . because the gg tau a binary has a mass ratio @xmath61 of approximately 0.88 , its accretion would be similar to the @xmath62 case shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "this figure shows that the streamers are asymmetric even though the binary orbit was circular in their simulation .",
    "they concluded that the asymmetry may be caused by the eccentric shape of the inner edge of a circumbinary disk driven by the binary tides , which lead to the different distances from the circumbinary disk to the binary in different directions .",
    "such asymmetric streamers have also been described by @xcite , who made simluation of the gg tau a binary in an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.3 .",
    "considering that the north arc appears to connect the northern side of the ring and gg tau ab , the north arc may be part of a large streamer extending from the circumbinary ring to the inner disk . as mentioned in section 3 ,",
    "the circumbinary ring is asymmetric , and the binary is much closer to the north ; thus , the streamer from the north is larger than that in the south .    in previous co j=65 observations by @xcite with alma ,",
    "two asymmetric co cores were detected in the inner disk ; implying possible interfaces of the streamers from the outer ring to the circumstellar disks around both stars . for a detailed comparison ,",
    "the co 65 image is superimposed on the present @xmath30 image in figure 3(a ) .",
    "the north arc coincides with the position of the northern co core observed by @xcite , suggesting that the north arc observed in this study could be part of a streamer observed in the nir band .    for an advanced investigation",
    ", we checked the co 65 velocity map in detail .",
    "the analysis of the co 65 velocity field near the northern part of the co 65 core of the inner region performed by @xcite revealed a large velocity dispersion of approximately 22.5 km / s , which is larger than the predicted keplerian rotation velocity dispersion of 1.2 km / s .",
    "this could be further evidence of the existence of the streamer .",
    "we also compared the present observations with the h@xmath2 emission observations by @xcite , which revealed the temperature distribution in the inner disk .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows a peak in the h@xmath2 emission represented by the darkest region that partly coincides with the north arc on its southern boundary , indicating a high temperature ( approximately 2000 k ) in this location .",
    "such high temperatures tend to be the result of shockwaves in the inner disk , which are likely caused by inflows as suggested by @xcite , whereas the north arc observed in this study is slightly north of the peak of the h@xmath2 emission .",
    "the peak of the hydrogen emission is located between the north arc and gg tau ab .",
    "one simple explanation for this is that the north arc observed in scattered light does not have a very high temperature and the temperature increases only when material begins to drop rapidly to gg tau ab .",
    "the co 65 core near the circumstellar disk around gg tau aa coincides with the possible disk structure . in the co j=32 map presented by @xcite ,",
    "there is one structure extending from gg tau aa ; thus , part of this possible disk structure could also be part of a streamer feeding the circumstellar disk around gg tau aa .",
    "this may explain why it is slightly larger than the previously reported disk size .",
    "however , the co 32 velocity map does not show clear sign of the material falling into gg tau aa , and the velocity field near gg tau aa from the co 65 velocity map is too complex to draw a conclusion .",
    "because the resolutions of the co maps obtained by @xcite and @xcite are relatively low ( approximately @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the co 32 and 65 maps , respectively ) , a higher - resolution observation may aid the further analysis of the velocity field in this disk .",
    "based on the parameters given in table 3 of @xcite and assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 100:1 , the toomre q parameter at disk radius 235 au is @xmath65 .",
    "thus the ring is gravitationally stable , and a planet can not form here through gravitational instability .",
    "previous co ( j=65 , 32 , and 21 ) images show a hotspot on the southwestern edge of the ring at a radius of approximately 250260 au that has a temperature of about 40 k , which is 20 k higher than those in other locations at the same distance from the gg tau a binary @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this hotspot is a signature of a potential planet .",
    "however , we see no corresponding structure in the present @xmath30 image .",
    "the lack of such a structure could be due to a low degree of polarization . the mass of this co hotspot reported by @xcite was only approximately @xmath66 , thus it could be too faint to detect even in a nir intensity image .",
    "for the circumstellar disks around the binaries , if the mass of the outer disk ( @xmath67 ; @xcite ) and the total accretion rate of both stars ( @xmath68yr ; @xcite ) are taken in account , the circumbinary gas rservoir can sustain the inner disk for at least 3 myr .",
    "because some planets with similar ages have been discovered so far , such as lkca 15 b with an age of 2 myr @xcite , a duration of 3 myr could be sufficient for a planet to form .",
    "radio continuum observations ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) have revealed the presence of large dust structures in the circumstellar disk around gg tau aa .",
    "minimum disk mass estimate of gg tau aa is approximately @xmath69@xcite , which may not be enough for the formation of a jupiter - like planet but may be feasible to form a neptune - like or terrestrial mass planet @xcite .",
    "the direct detection of the circumstellar disk around gg tau ab has not been reported yet .",
    "some studies such as that by @xcite , and the presence of streamer to gg tau ab , give indirect evidence of the presence of the circumstellar disk .",
    "moreover , because gg tau ab itself is a binary , @xcite has noted that a putative disk associated with ab would have been tidally truncated . as a result , the disk size around either gg tau ab1 or ab2 must be less than 1/3 of the binary separation of gg tau ab , which is approximately 4.2 au , and its circumbinary disk radius can be no larger than 13 au .",
    "therefore , the environment around gg tau ab binary may be hostile to planet formation .",
    "using subaru / hiciao with the ao188 system , a high - spatial - resolution ( 0.07@xmath1 ) image of the circumbinary disk around the gg tau a binary was successfully obtained . in comparison with previous observations ,",
    "the present polarimetry observations provide a much more detailed view of the disk structure inside the circumbinary ring .",
    "the present results indicate that the circumbinary disk around the binary is asymmetric and the binary is much closer to the northern edge of the ring than to the southern edge . by analyzing the sizes of the ring s inner edge and the circumstellar disk around gg tau aa , it was determined that the large semi major axis solution of 62 au for the binary orbit is more likely than the small semi major axis solution of 32 au .",
    "an arc structure north of gg tau ab called the north arc in this paper and a possible circumstellar disk structure around gg tau aa were observed inside the circumbinary ring .",
    "a comparison of the present observation results with previous observations and theoretical calculations suggests that the north arc may be part of a large streamer extending from the circumbinary ring to gg tau ab .",
    "based on previous estimates of the accretion rate and the outer disk mass , the streamer to the circumstellar disk around each star may provide enough material for sub - jovian planets to form in the disk around gg tau aa . considering the circumstellar disk around each star , it seems that gg tau aa has a better chance to form a neptune - like or terrestrial planet than gg tau ab .",
    "this discovery may help reveal one aspect of the formation process of planets located in close binaries such as @xmath10 cep ab , and it may be helpful in improving our understanding of the planet formation process in binary star systems",

    "the general process of removing the polarized halo which was not fully corrected by the ao system involves rebuilding the polarized halos for stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images then subtracting them from the original images .",
    "after that , the corrected image can be used to produce a halo - corrected polarized intensity image .    to create an artificial psf halo around the binary , the radial brightness profile of the two stars",
    "must first be calibrated in the stokes @xmath29 image .",
    "the radial profiles of the two stars can be derived using iraf and python scripts , and the luminosity @xmath70 and radius @xmath71 are then fit by the function @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are fitting parameters . the radial profile and fitting results",
    "are shown in figure 4(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "considering that only the polarized halos require fitting , the profiles are fit from 15 to 140 pixels to exclude the disturbances from the central airy disk psf .",
    "after @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 have been determined for each halo , the observed brightness ratio of the halo in the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images must be compared to that of the stokes @xmath29 image to help regenerate the polarized halos in the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images . for every stokes image ,",
    "photometry is conducted by first calibrating the flux with apertures of 15 and 140 pixels for gg tau aa and ab , respectively . then subtracting the flux within 15 pixels from the flux calibrated within 140 pixels for each star .",
    "thus , the flux of the psf halo can be obtained for each star in all stokes images .",
    "the ratio of the halo brightness in the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images to that of the stokes @xmath29 image is then obtained .",
    "based on the fitting and photometry results , the polarized halo for each star can be regenerated in the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images in the end .    for the case of a single star ,",
    "the next step is to subtract the generated psf halo from the original stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "however , in the case of a binary , an extra step is required to combine the halos of the two companion stars in the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "considering that the halos are generated from the observation results , the psf halo from the star itself and the effect of the other star are both included in the fitted halos .",
    "that is why the two halos can not be combined by simply adding them together . here",
    ", the maximum values of the two halos were mixed , i.e. , for the halo @xmath76 around gg tau aa and that @xmath77 around gg tau ab , the final combined halo would be @xmath78 . the combined halos for the stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 images are shown in figure 5 .",
    "after these combined halos have been obtained , they are subtracted from each of the corresponding original stokes images to obtain the halo - corrected @xmath30 images ( figure 6(b ) ) . in figure 6(b ) , it can be seen that the vectors are generally centrosymmetric rather than aligned in one direction , which demonstrates that the vectors were corrected successfully using this method .",

    "the rectangle - like structure around the image is an artifact caused by the data reduction process .",

    "the inner and outer edges are shown in yellow and red , respectively .",
    "the yellow and red crosses represent the centers of the inner and outer edges , respectively .",
    "the yellow star represents one of the foci of the inner edge .",
    "based on the theory , the barycenter of the binary should be near this focus .",

    "the polarization angles @xmath79 were calculated using the formula @xmath80 in bins of ( a ) 7 and ( b ) 3 pixels , and only areas brighter than 15 analog - to - digital unit ( adu ) counts are drawn .",

    "<S> based on the size of the circumbinary ring and the circumstellar disk around gg tau aa , the semi - major axis of the binary s orbit is likely to be 62 au . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the present observations with previous alma and near - infrared ( nir ) h@xmath2 emission observations suggests that the north arc could be part of a large streamer flowing from the circumbinary ring to sustain the circumstellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> according to the previous studies , the circumstellar disk around gg tau aa has enough mass and can sustain itself for a duration sufficient for planet formation ; thus , our study indicates that planets can form within close ( separation @xmath3 100 au ) young binary systems . </S>"
