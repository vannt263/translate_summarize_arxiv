    "brain computer interface ( bci ) is the technology which can allow for an operation of any computerized devices without any muscle activity  @xcite .",
    "state of the art bcis are implemented based on a classification of feature values extracted from brain activities , but their accuracies still not allow for broad applications .",
    "therefore , there is a need for improvement of the classification accuracy for a better quality interfacing applications .",
    "recent and hot research projects for the improvement are related to an auditory bci ( abci ) , which is a method applying auditory evoked responses ( aer ) generated by corresponding sound stimuli such as auditory steady - state response ( assr )  @xcite . even though the contemporary studies report on relibable classification accuracy",
    ", there is still a plenty of room for the improvement  @xcite .",
    "there are several types in bci shown as figure  [ fig : bcitree ]  @xcite .",
    "the applications can be divided into two types : invasive- and non - invasive bci .",
    "invasive bci has usually a lower signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , but it requires a surgical operation of skull to embed the electrodes on / in cortical surface .",
    "contrarily , non - invasive bci can be used by attaching electrodes on surface of human head , but the snr is lower than in case of invasive technology .",
    "therefore , in case of the non - invasive bci development of accurate applications is more challenging .",
    "the next difficulty is related to simple interfacing paradigms design , of which imagery one based on user s intentional brain waves modulation caused by imagination / planning of certain actions ( imagery movement , etc . )",
    "is the most popular one . as a solution to this problem",
    "is a method which applies brain responses to artificial sensory stimuli for generating the commands called a stimuli - driven bci ( see figure  [ fig : bcitree ] ) .",
    "for example , an user chooses to concentrate on one stimulus from multiple presented sequentially , which evokes a specific event related potential ( erp ) pattern called `` aha - response '' or p300 , since it is a positive eeg deflection around @xmath0ms after the stimuli onset  @xcite .",
    "the bci application classifies the responses and translates them into computerized commands . in case of abci",
    "the erps evoked by the auditory stimuli are utilized .",
    "the presented research focuses on the abci paradigm based on an auditory steady - state response ( assr ) , which is usually used by physicians as a method for a hearing level estimation  @xcite , and it is evoked by periodic modulated sound . while a subject is listening the sound , the brain eeg response synchronizes with the amplitude modulating frequency",
    ". therefore , a spectral peak in eeg appears at the same frequency as the modulating one .",
    "in addition , it was shown that while the subject concentrates listening to the sound stimulus , the response power rises  @xcite .",
    "the difference allows for a classification of the responses into _ targets _ and _ non  targets_. _ the target _ refers to the chosen stimulus and _ the non  target _ to the ignored one .    applying this feature , higashi et al .",
    "@xcite designed an abci , which was named an assr bci .",
    "that paper has preliminarily proven the efficiency of assr bci , however , there is still necessity for further improvement before a successful application of the paradigms with patients in need .    in case of the classical assr based subjective hearing level estimation ,",
    "there are studies showing that assr could be evoked by various modulation types , yet sinusoidal  amplitude  modulation ( sam ) remains the most common choice in medical assr applications  @xcite .",
    "however , the hearing level estimation is often conducted while a subject is sleeping  @xcite , thus there is no attentional related response modulation possible .",
    "in other words , sam sounds can cause large assr even when the subject is unconscious .",
    "this feature is not desirable for the bci application focusing responses to attentionally differentiated _ targets _ and _ non  targets_. therefore , it is a need to further research on more efficient stimuli types for assr based bci .",
    "an additional problem that shall be resolved is related to the optimization of stimulation length .",
    "the stimuli should be long enough to evoke assr .",
    "however , if the longer stimuli are used , the inter - commands intervals will be also extended resulting in very low information  transfer  rates ( itr ) .",
    "also the slower interfacing experience caused by longer stimuli interval downgrades the interfacing experience for the users .",
    "moreover , the longer stimuli interval would be an obstacle in development of an application based on multi - commands bci .",
    "therefore , we aim to find the optimal stimulation length for the assr bci",
    ".    in this paper we report on our research comparing the assr classification results for various sound stimuli types and lengths .",
    "in this section , first we describe assr stimuli used for our bci experiments .",
    "next we discuss eeg signal processing and classification steps .",
    "the state of the art assr bci , as reported in  @xcite , could be built for a two commands interface based on sam .",
    "sam signal @xmath1 is obtained as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a time - course , @xmath4 is a carrier tone frequency , and the @xmath5 is an envelope modulation frequency .",
    "an exemplary waveform is shown in figure  [ fig : sam ] . in contemporary assr trials",
    "the stimulation length is usually @xmath6s or longer .",
    "the conventional assr bci application  @xcite delivered the sound stimuli to the user from two different spatial directions one - by - one via headphones .",
    "the directions corresponded to modulation frequencies ( for example , @xmath7hz stimulus from the left channel and @xmath8 hz from the right one ) .",
    "the user chose a command by concentrating on one of the directions , while ignoring the other one .",
    "bci application extracted the feature values from the monitored simultaneously eeg data . in a next step",
    "the features were classified leading to a resulting command .",
    "it was shown for the @xmath9 subjects that a classification accuracy was in a range @xmath10@xmath11 for the binary case .",
    "those results are a proof of concept that the assr based bci is a promising technology , yet the authors also pointed a necessity for further development .",
    "we aim to improve the assr bci by optimizing the stimuli types and their lengths .",
    "we test three new am envelope types , which shall improve assr detection in eeg .",
    "the three new modulation envelopes are described in next sections and followed by a discussion of shorter stimuli lengths comparing to conventional assr applications .",
    "we test the following three new modulations types : flutter am ( fam ) , periodic clicks and combination of am and fm ( `` am / fm '' ) modulations .",
    "the fam stimulus @xmath12 is obtained as follows , @xmath13 where @xmath4 is the carrier frequency and @xmath5 is the modulating envelope one .",
    "the resulting exemplary waveform is depicted in figure  [ fig : flutter ] .",
    "usually brain responses captured in eeg are easier to distinguish from more obvious changes like in case of pulses or transitions from silence to louder auditory sensation  @xcite .",
    "the fam stimuli with silent intervals is based on the above observations .",
    "we expect the eeg features extracted from responses to the fam stimulus to reflect the effect of surprising sound resulting with simpler classification of attended _ targets_.    a periodic clicks stimulus generates periodic click sounds with the same number of ticks as the frequency value .",
    "the stimuli are generated from discrete train of neighboring @xmath14 and @xmath15 values in each click interval as presented in figure  [ fig : clicks ] . in this paper ,",
    "the frequency of clicks is defined as modulation frequency for easy comparison with the remaining assr stimuli types .",
    "click stimuli also have an effect as the surprising sound for the experimental subjects .",
    "moreover , the click stimulus is easier to attend or ignore by the subjects due to its very transient and broad frequency nature .",
    "finally we also propose the am / fm based combination of signals to generate the assr envelope modulation based stimulus .",
    "this allows us also to check possibility to utilize frequency modulated tones .",
    "the am / fm modulated assr stimulus @xmath16 is generated as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are frequencies of the two carrier sounds , as it can be seen in figure  [ fig : fm ] .",
    "the two different tones sound alternate synchronizing to create an am envelope similar in shape as in case of the classical sam stimulus in equation  ( [ eq : sam ] ) .",
    "am / fm sound is more friendly for the subjects comparing to the simple sam tone , since it has a more friendly alternating ( musical ) temporal structure .",
    "therefore , we hypothesize , that application of this novel stimuli to the auditory bci shall result in more comfortable interfacing experience .      the shorter stimuli for multi - stimuli paradigms , based alternating time sharing protocol , usual result with better itr .",
    "for example , time to present all commands in order to generate the final successful command becomes shorter .",
    "that also results in lower burden or tiredness of the subjects . on the other hand , if the stimuli would be too short , the machine learning algorithms would not be able to detect the assr .",
    "we propose to evaluate the three stimuli lengths , which are still shorter comparing to the conventional lengths .",
    "the experiments conducted in this paper are with @xmath20s , @xmath14s and @xmath21s lengths . in out",
    "preliminary experiment , reported in  @xcite , the @xmath6s long stimulation forced subjects to concentrate for a long time . that resulted in increased tiredness and sleepiness causing a drop in interfacing efficiency .",
    "therefore , based on the above mentioned previous experience , in this paper we attempt only to use shorter stimuli intervals than 5s",
    ". the comparison shall be helpful to optimize a tradeoff between the classification accuracy and the interfacing comfort for the subjects .",
    "we conducted eeg experiments to record eeg for further offline analysis of the responses to various stimuli types and lengths .",
    "the purpose is to find how much the changing experimental conditions affect the assr variability for _ targets _ versus _ non  targets _ discrimination .",
    "the eeg experiments were conducted with five subjects who agreed to participate voluntarily .",
    "the experimental protocol was designed in accordance with our local institutions ethical committee and _ wma declaration of helsinki _ guidelines .    in the experiments ,",
    "the number of stimuli types was set to four as follows : sam as in  ( [ eq : sam ] ) , fam as in  ( [ eq : flutter ] ) , periodic clicks , and am / fm as in  ( [ eq : amfm ] ) .",
    "the number of stimuli lengths was set to three : @xmath20s , @xmath14s and @xmath21s .",
    "the stimuli were generated from three spatial directions which have corresponding modulation frequency : the @xmath22hz modulated stimulus is always delivered only from the left channel ; the @xmath8hz one from the right ; and the @xmath23hz one from the both channels creating an illusion of a center location . the carrier tones for sam and fam stimuli were set to @xmath24 hz .",
    "the am / fm carrier tones were set to @xmath24 and @xmath25 hz alternating tones .",
    "eeg was recorded using a @xmath26 channel ` g.usbamp ` amplifier by ` g.tec ` .",
    "the @xmath26 active wet electrodes were attached to the following scalp locations f@xmath21 , f@xmath27 , c@xmath14 , c@xmath28 , c@xmath21 , c@xmath27 , c@xmath6 , c@xmath29 .",
    "t@xmath30 , t@xmath31 , cp@xmath14 , cp@xmath28 , p@xmath14 , p@xmath28 , pz , and cz , as in _ 10/10 system _ layout  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : elec_pos ] ) .",
    "the reference was connected to the left earlobe .",
    "the ground was connected to the fpz scalp location .",
    "the recorded eeg at each electrode was preprocessed by application ` bci 2000 ` as follows .",
    "the sampling rate was set to @xmath32hz and the digital filters were set to pass eeg frequencies in a range of @xmath33hz . a notch filter to remove electric power lines interference of @xmath34hz was set in a band of @xmath35hz according to the the east japan power stations specifications .",
    "the offline bci experiment is conducted as follows .",
    "three frequencies stimuli are presented at random order from each of the three different directions via inner - headphones ( see figure [ fig : stim_t ] ) .",
    "presentation of the above three stimuli constitutes a single trial .",
    "we conduct experiments with each subject for @xmath36 trials . during the first @xmath9 trials ,",
    "a subject is instructed to concentrate only to the left direction with _ the target _ stimuli and ignore the others as _ non  targets_. in the next @xmath9 trials - the center location is a target . finally in the remaining @xmath9 trials - the right direction is a target .",
    "the interval of breaks between each offset of a stimulus and onset of next one is set to @xmath37ms .",
    "there are also longer breaks between each of @xmath9 trials sessions .",
    "the above procedure is repeated for each of @xmath38 stimuli variation ( three different lengths and four types ) .",
    "eeg data recorded on offline bci mode during our experiments are next processed in order to extract features necessary for easy comparison of _ target _ versus _ non  target_. the feature is necessary for a final classification leading to the bci commands .      as the feature value",
    ", we use a phase locking value ( plv )  @xcite .",
    "plv outperforms the other tested methods of discrete fourier transform ( dft ) and coherence analysis .",
    "plv quantifies phase coupling between two signals which are recorded at different electrodes .",
    "when the two eeg signals are coupled , a hypothesis could be drawn that they originate from the same brain source or they are related to the same perceptual or cognitive process . in case of the very noisy multichannel recordings such as eeg signals , a strong signal distributed among many electrodes is expected to result in multiple phase couplings .",
    "unlike the amplitude based methods , such as coherence analysis , plv can detect the signal which has a very tiny amplitude , like assr , buried in a very low snr recording environment as in case of eeg captured from the human scalp .",
    "plv is obtained as follows . at first",
    ", we apply a bandpass filtering to target only the interesting frequencies of the given signal @xmath39 , which is recorded at the @xmath40-electrode .",
    "the filter band is set from @xmath41hz to @xmath42hz .",
    "next we construct an analytic signal for each electrode signal @xmath39 as @xmath43 :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is an imaginary unit and @xmath46 is the hilbert transformed version of @xmath39 .",
    "next with an instantaneous phase @xmath47 and a radius @xmath48 the equation ( [ eq : eta ] ) can be substituted by the following formulation : @xmath49 from to the equation ( [ eq : ax ] ) , @xmath47 which is an instantaneous phase of the original signal @xmath39 , is obtained as @xmath50 finally , the difference between instantaneous phases of two signals @xmath39 and @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 and it is obtained as , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are ratio of synchronicity between @xmath39 and @xmath51 . in case of a single brain source detection from eeg , @xmath56 equals @xmath57 , leading to @xmath58    practically , the plv is quantified by averaging of the unit vector @xmath59 over time . therefore , in case of discrete signals , plv is obtained as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the length of the analyzed signal window . in our case",
    "@xmath61 equals to the stimulus length .",
    "the plv is normalized between zero and one .",
    "the zero means that @xmath39 and @xmath51 are not coupled at all .",
    "the plv equals to one means that the two analyzed eeg channels are perfectly coupled in the narrow analysis frequency band .",
    "we calculate plvs for each assr in eeg and for all pairwise combinations of the @xmath26 electrodes . as a result from the whole experimental session ,",
    "we obtain @xmath62 ( @xmath63 trials ) plv sets from all stimuli types and lengths .",
    "each plv set contains @xmath64 features @xmath65 , because @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "finally , we create a @xmath64-dimensional feature vector @xmath68 for the classification of the each @xmath69 stimuli as follows : @xmath70.\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{eq : fvec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      for the classification , we use a method of naive bayes classifier ( nbc )  @xcite applied in _ leave  one  out _ cross - validation mode using nan - toolbox  @xcite .",
    "the nbc method is rated as the best in comparison with linear discriminant and regression analysis based classification techniques  @xcite .",
    "we contact a comparison among various stimuli types and lengths as in the following approach :    * first , we try to find out how much the _ target _ versus _ non  target _ detection is affected in various experimental conditions .",
    "* second , we compare whether we could discriminate targets based on different acoustic source locations .",
    "the first test is to confirm assr difference between _ targets _ and _ non ",
    "targets_. this result is obtained from classification result in each stimulation with responses labeled as _ targets _ and _ non  targets _ , based on experimental instruction given to the subjects .",
    "this test is based on a separation of the @xmath62 responses into three direction classes : left , right , and center .",
    "we obtain @xmath36 samples for each direction class : @xmath9 samples are labeled as _ target_-direction and the remaining @xmath71 become the _ non  target_-directions .",
    "the latter test is conducted to confirm the accuracy of assr bci commands .",
    "the responses from each single trial are labeled into three classes of : left , center , and right directions .",
    "we combine the three feature vectors of each trial and redefine that as a single sample . therefore ,",
    "there are @xmath72 features for each stimuli and @xmath36 samples for each type and length ( @xmath9 samples labeled as left ; @xmath9 as center ; and @xmath9 as right ) .    in the both tests ,",
    "the classifier for a single condition is independent from the others .",
    "for the comparison among different experiments , we use a value of classification accuracy ( ca ) resulting from the _ leave  one  out _ cross - validation conducted in a single condition .",
    "ca is defined as a rate of the number of the correctly classified assr responses to the all in a single experiment .",
    "the results of classification for _ target _ versus _ non  target _ are shown in figures  [ fig : tnline ]  and  [ fig : tnbar ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : tnline ] contains a plot of ca averaged over all subjects for the comparison between stimulation lengths .",
    "the detail values are shown in table [ tab : tnline ] . according to the all lines in that figure , the longer stimulation , the better",
    "ca becomes , so shortening assr stimuli below @xmath21s is not advised from assr bci .",
    "additionally , the sam stimuli seems to be the best in averaged responses .",
    "figure  [ fig : tnbar ] presents a plot of ca presents only results from the best stimuli length of @xmath21s length for the comparison of various modulations .",
    "the detail values are shown in table [ tab : tnbar ] .",
    "the results show no significant differences among the tested assr generators of sam , fam , periodic clicks , and am / fm . this is a very encouraging news that assr could be evoked with various periodic sound stimuli .",
    "that could enhance bci interfacing experience by lowering possible weariness or habituation to a monotonic repetitive sounds .",
    "the results of classification for _ target _ direction within a single trial are shown in figure  [ fig : clline ] for a comparison between stimulation lengths and in figure  [ fig : clbar ] among various modulation types .",
    "the detail values of figure  [ fig : clline ] are shown in table  [ tab : clline ] and those of figure  [ fig : clbar ] are shown in table  [ tab : clbar ] . the same as in the above _ target _ versus _ non  target _ comparison results ,",
    "figure  [ fig : clline ] is created from the averaged results from all the subjects .",
    "figure  [ fig : clbar ] is also generated from the @xmath21s long stimuli to compare stimuli types variability .",
    "there is also no significant difference among the averaged results in figure  [ fig : clline ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the stimuli types cause differences in assr as shown by dotted lines in figure  [ fig : clline ] . according to figure [ fig : clbar ]",
    ", the responses to sam stimuli result with subject independent accuracies comparing to the other assr . on the other hand ,",
    "there are better stimulus types than sam according to the accuracies for each subject .",
    "when we average the accuracies over the best stimulus types for each subject , the result will be @xmath73 .",
    "based on the conducted eeg experiments in offline assr bci mode , it has been shown that the stimulation length of @xmath20 second has been just above a chance level , as resulting from the nbc classification in _ leave  one  out _ cross - validation mode .",
    "therefore , the @xmath20s stimulus is too short to cause assr possible to classify in a bci setting . on the other hand",
    ", the classification accuracy seems to increase monotonically together with the stimulation length .",
    "the encouraging results for the @xmath21s long stimuli , where the accuracy seems to start to saturate already , are a step forward comparing with the state of the are assr bci applications . more research is necessary in this assr stimuli range to determine with higher accuracy the optimal stimuli lengths .",
    "a comparison of the various modulation types has been resulted with the outcome , that actually the conventional sam based assr is the best for the three subjects out of the five tested .",
    "this result has shown that subject dependence is a very strong factor in abci design and the subjects shall be tested for their best and preferred responses . according to presented results , while the average classification accuracy for sam has been @xmath74 , the best stimuli type for each subject has scored @xmath75 on average .",
    "this performance is already adequate for practical bci application , yet there is still plenty of room for possible improvement .",
    "a single subject had better results for am / fm and clicks based assr comparing to sam .",
    "those particular two stimuli types have different carrier frequencies comparing the the simple sam stimuli .",
    "this results suggest that there is a possibility that the carrier sound could influence the results .",
    "the additional research topic shall be investigated to optimize the carrier sounds of the assr for each user .",
    "additionally , the modulation frequencies and stimuli directions has been unified for all the subjects in our experiments .",
    "the classification results could be improved by optimization of them for the subject",
    ". this will be also a topic of our future research .",
    "on the other hand , optimizations for each user require long time for machine leaning before his / her first use of practical and successful online bci . therefore , other approaches shall improve possibly user s convenience .    for example",
    ", the electrodes position could be further optimized , since in our experiments we also unified them . in the presented study ,",
    "the electrodes were distributed over the auditory cortices , temporal , parietal and frontal brain lobes .",
    "the plv features has been calculated from the all electrodes combinations . however , in case of plv , there is a danger that the very close positioned electrodes might results with unnecessary saturated values due to their close proximity .",
    "therefore , it is expected that more significant feature vector could be given by optimization of electrodes positioning .    in addition",
    ", we plan to extend or combine the assr with attentional alpha - wave modulation or synchronization with lower frequency steady - state responses , which already have shown in our former research  @xcite to have stronger modulatory impact .",
    "the other choice could be an inclusion of haptic / somatosensory or bone - conductance based stimulation based on tactile exciters attached to the fingers or facial areas .",
    "the presented research is a step forward in development of novel bci paradigms .",

    "<S> we propose a method for an improvement of auditory bci ( abci ) paradigm based on a combination of assr stimuli optimization by choosing the subjects best responses to am- , flutter- , am / fm and click - envelope modulated sounds . as the assr response features </S>",
    "<S> we propose pairwise phase  locking  values calculated from the eeg and next classified using binary classifier to detect attended and ignored stimuli . </S>",
    "<S> we also report on a possibility to use the stimuli as short as half a second , which is a step forward in assr based abci . </S>",
