    "the incorporation of fermionic degrees of freedom in lattice simulations presents a serious difficulties which stem from their being anticommuting variables . for the most actions in use which are quadratic in fermionic fields",
    ", one can eliminate fermions by an analytic integration .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting expressions involve the determinant of a very large matrix , which induces nonlocal long - range interactions on the gauge fields , making the numerical simulations rather expensive .",
    "the most often used method to simulate fermionic field theories is now hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm @xcite , which addresses the problem of nonlocality by linearizing the action in a succession of molecular dynamics steps .",
    "it is exact and easily implementable , but still the fermionic simulations turn out to be very time consuming and alternative approaches are welcome .",
    "an interesting idea has been put forward by m. lscher @xcite , who proposed to approximate the inverse of the fermion matrix with a polynomial , and then interprete the determinant as the partition function of a local bosonic system .",
    "this technique has been studied thorougly for the last five years and it was claimed to be competitive to the hmc algorithm and even superior when fermions are heavy ( a detailed analysis can be found in refs@xcite ) . however the efficiency of lescher s method is abated when quark mass decreases .",
    "another approach to the problem of dynamical fermions simulation was proposed by a. slavnov in papers @xcite , where a d - dimensional fermion determinant was presented as a path integral of a ( d+1)-dimensional local bosonic action . in ref.@xcite",
    "this procedure was tested by numerical simulation of a one dimensional toy model and it was shown that correct and accurate results can be obtained with a reasonable size of lattice in auxiliary dimension . in this paper",
    "we present some results from test runs for su(2 ) qcd with 2 degenerate heavy wilson quarks , using the version of slavnov s algorithm from ref.@xcite .",
    "for the local gauge theory with two flavours of wilson quarks the effective distribution of the gauge field @xmath1 is given by    p[u]det ( d[u]+m)^2 e^-s_g[u][1]where @xmath2 $ ] is wilson - dirac operator    d=_@xmath3 $ ] denotes the usual plaquette action and @xmath4 is the bare quark mass which is related to hopping parameter @xmath5 through @xmath6 . the lattice spacing has been set equal to unity for simplicity .",
    "it will be advantageous for us to work with hermitean operator @xmath7 , so we rewrite expression ( [ 1 ] ) in the form    p[u]det b[u]^2 e^-s_g[u][3 ]    now following ref.@xcite , we introduce five dimensional bosonic fields @xmath8 , where the extra coordinate @xmath9 is defined on one dimensional chain of the length @xmath10 with the lattice spacing @xmath11",

    "since the computational cost of the algorithm depends on @xmath29 , the parameters @xmath32 should be optimally tuned to make @xmath29 as small as possible .",
    "in this section we present the results from numerical simulations of the bosonic theory ( [ 17 ] ) on a @xmath0 lattice with gauge group su(2 ) and bare parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the simulations for the same model and parameters were already done in ref.@xcite within the framework of luescher s formulation of the dynamical quarks problem @xcite . that will allow us to compare the algorithm explored in this paper with the luescher s one .",
    "the implementation was done on a quadrics q4 machine ( ape computer ) with 32 nodes .",
    "a full update cycle involved 1 heatbath and 1 overrelaxation sweep for the fields @xmath14 followed by 1 heatbath sweep for the fields @xmath28 and gauge fields @xmath1 .",
    "( our preparatory tests showed that overrelaxing the gauge fields and the fields @xmath28 does not decrease autocorrelaton times @xmath35 . on the contrary ,",
    "overrelaxing the fields @xmath14 can decrease @xmath35 substantially . ) for each set of parameters @xmath36 we have performed at least 30000 and sometimes up to 80000 such cycles after thermalization of the system , using the random number generator of ref.@xcite .",
    "our test runs were structurally divided into a sequence of `` experiments '' in which the systematic errors ( [ 16 ] ) were studied separately . in each `` experiment '' we fixed some of the parameters @xmath37 , holding the corresponding errors fixed and altered the other parameters .",
    "this way of investigation of the systematic errors allows to determine the values of parameters at which one may be able to get correct results at given level of statistics , using the bosonic theory with relatively small number of points in auxiliary dimension @xmath29 .    in the first `` experiment ''",
    "we fixed @xmath38 , @xmath39 to study the alteration of the plaquette value when the lattice spacing in auxiliary dimension @xmath11 changes . by doing",
    "so we investigated the algorithm s error of the order @xmath19 for fixed errors @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the results of the simulations are reported in table 1 . in fig .",
    "1 the plaquette values multiplied by 100 are plotted against the inverse lattice spacing @xmath42 .",
    "the plot shows that the plaquette value stabilizes quickly when @xmath11 decreases . from the data obtained we see that at this level of statistics one may be able to do with @xmath43 to make the systematic error of the order @xmath19 small .    [",

    "the simulation results for the plaquette and meson masses from table 4 show that the measured values stabilize when @xmath26 decreases . from the data",
    "obtained we see that at this level of statistics one may be able to do with @xmath46 to make the error of the order @xmath41 small .",
    "let us make a conclusion to this section .",
    "we investigated the systematic errors of slavnov s algorithm and got the values of algorithm s parameters at which in the tested model the errors can be considered small at the given level of statistical precision .",
    "these values are as follows :    0.03;b 0.08;bn 5.0;0.8 [ ol1]from the conditions ( [ ol1 ] ) we infer that it is enough to take @xmath47 points in auxiliary dimension to get correct results in the tested model . to check up this statement we made a control test run at @xmath48 .",
    "the measured plaquette value @xmath49 within the statistical error coincided with the result obtained from hmc in paper @xcite : @xmath50 .",
    "in this paper we performed the first investigation of systematic error effects of slavnov s algorithm in a realistic model .",
    "it was shown that at this level of statistics one may be able to do with @xmath47 points in auxiliary dimension .",
    "this is comparable with the number of bosonic fields which was necessary to get the correct results in the same model from lscher s algorithm in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the action ( [ 6 ] ) and the effective bosonic action in lscher s formulation of the dynamical fermions problem are similar in a sense that computational effort per update cycle is almost the same for both algorithms if the number of bosonic fields in lscher s algorithm is equal to the number of points in auxiliary dimension @xmath29 in action ( [ 6 ] ) ( the update of the fields @xmath28 in the action ( [ 6 ] ) takes less than @xmath51 of total computer time ) .",
    "accordingly both algorithms are comparable in an amount of computer time which is necessary per full update cycle .",
    "we observed the growth of autocorrelation times when @xmath29 increases .",
    "it seems that such an autocorrelation behavior is the general feature of multibosonic algorithms ( the theoretical justification of this fact can be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the autocorrelation times in our simulations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 are almost two times less than the ones for the same numbers of bosonic fields in lscher s formulation measured in ref.@xcite , but our mc runs were rather short and that may tend to underestimating the algorithm s autocorrelation time .",
    "a more careful investigation of autocorrelation behaviour in slavnov s algorithm requires further extensive tests on a more powerful computers .",
    "it is interesting that the systematic errors @xmath19 and @xmath41 from the one side and @xmath40 from the other side for the measured quantities compensate each other .",
    "this fact can lead to the considerable improvement of results even for moderate values of @xmath29 as it was observed in the present research .",
    "the present performance of slavnov s algorithm can be considerably improved by diminishing the systematic error from @xmath19 to @xmath54 .",
    "this can be put into effect by adding to the action ( [ 6 ] ) the terms    s= _ xwhere the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be computed theoretically ( this work is under progress ) .",
    "also even - odd preconditioning can be incorporated to reduce the number of points in auxiliary dimension @xmath29 .",
