    "the extraordinary advancements made in the physical sciences at the beginning of twentieth century originated from the effort to understand the simplest , that is , the most fundamental , elements of physical phenomena . the separation of matter and light into its basic constituents : electrons , protons , atoms , and molecules in the first case and photons in the second , enabled scientists to explain the puzzling properties of solid materials , such as their sound transmission and electrical properties , as well as , light emission and reflection characteristics .",
    "the discipline of statistical mechanics demonstrated that the behavior of systems composed of millions of individual particles can be captured with simple laws , involving only their average properties @xcite . at that time it seemed as if the aristotelian approach of reductionism , where complex phenomena consisted of nothing more than the sum of essential elements , was the prescription underlying the correct method of scientific discovery .",
    "the french mathematician poincar was probably the first to rigorously demonstrate the failure of this attractive but overly optimistic method by extending newton s law of universal gravitation to a system consisting of three celestial bodies @xcite .",
    "his mathematical treatment of the three - body problem demonstrated that unlike the two - body problem of the earth and sun , a planet s orbit in the three - body system need not be periodic .",
    "poincar proved that the long held belief that planetary motion could be built up from the superposition of simple cycles was false .",
    "this unanticipated behavior emerges from nonlinear dynamics and has come to be known as chaos theory .",
    "another perplexing phenomena that violates the principle of superposition is critical phase transitions in magnetic materials . if criticality were truly nothing more than collective behavior resulting from the superposition of some basic building blocks ,",
    "why then does the change in an external parameter , for example temperature , induce such a dramatic shift in its macroscopic behavior ?",
    "more recently the identification of emergent phenomena across multiple disciplines , from the swarming of insects @xcite , the schooling of fish @xcite and the flocking of birds @xcite observed in animal groups by naturalists ; to the spatiotemporal activity of the brain @xcite observed by neurophysiologists ; to the collective and cooperative behavior observed in social groups studied by psychologists and sociologists ; all demonstrate collective behavior reminiscent of particle dynamics near the critical phase transitions studied by physicists @xcite . each of these disciplines has demonstrated the need to investigate the dynamics of complex networks across scales in order to develop a deeper understanding of how large - scale behavior emerges from microscale dynamics and the sensitivity of the observed behavior to those dynamics .    of particular interest to us here",
    "are the biological fields in which we observe a need for a system wide approach @xcite .",
    "the recent discoveries in biology were propelled by the successes of molecular biology and genetics that have made available genomic blueprints of numerous organisms , which are complemented by extensive experimental data describing cell functions . at the same time",
    "however the realization came that biological function emerges out of the interaction of numerous molecular components , such as depicted in figure [ fig_markram ] for the human brain , making the detailed knowledge of specific components at any level of organization insufficient to capture macroscopic functionality .",
    "there is probably no better example of this limitation then the study of the neurological systems , whose goal is to understand , predict and ultimately modify ( in order to heal ) brain function .",
    "ongoing initiatives of the human connectome project @xcite , the human brain project @xcite or the allen brain atlas @xcite illustrate the fact that the system wide approach and integration of data from across different spatial and temporal scales has become the norm in modern scientific disciplines .        despite experimental developments ,",
    "the ability of science to make theoretical predictions of the behavior of complex networks is still in its infancy .",
    "the adoption of methods from non - equilibrium statistical physics have demonstrated limitations , resulting from the fact that living systems , in contrast to inert physical materials , are extremely heterogeneous , non - generic , highly specialized and operate far from an equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "herein we demonstrate that what was for a very long time a niche branch of mathematics , the fractional calculus , might very well be able to span the gap between the inert materials of physics and the living networks of biology .",
    "although developed along side the classical calculus , fractional differential equations have only recently been shown to be a convenient way to describe the dynamics of complex phenomena characterized by long - term memory and spatial heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "fractional differential equations were demonstrated to capture the time evolution of fractal processes , such as in anomalous diffusion , viscoelasticity and turbulent fluid flow , as reviewed by west and grigolini @xcite . in spite of the success of the mathematical descriptions of such processes",
    "there has been a lack of identification and interpretation of mechanisms that entail fractional dynamic equations in the context of complex networks .",
    "herein we provide an explanation for one source of a fractional differential equation that describes the dynamics of a complex network using a fractional master equation .    here the utility of the fractional calculus is demonstrated by capturing the dynamics of the individual elements of a complex network from the information quantifying that network s global behavior .",
    "the phase transitions observed in complex social and physiologic networks suggest the wisdom of using a generic model from the ising universality class to characterize network dynamics .",
    "using such a model it is then possible to demonstrate that the individual trajectory response to the collective motion of the network is described by a linear fractional differential equation .",
    "the solution to this fractional equation is obtained through a subordination procedure without the necessity of linearizing the underlying dynamics , that is , the solution retains the influence of the nonlinear network dynamics on the individual .",
    "moreover the solutions to the fractional equations of motion suggest a new direction for designing control mechanisms for complex networks .",
    "in section [ dmm ] we consider the dynamics of a complex network described by a two - state master equation .",
    "the decision making model ( dmm ) , defined by the two - state master equation , undergoes phase transitions at a critical value of the control parameter @xcite .",
    "it is understood that at criticality the short - range local interactions between the two - state elements generate long - range global correlations , thereby producing effective long - range interactions .",
    "consequently at criticality there is global cooperation among the network elements .",
    "an individual disconnected from the network is assumed to choose randomly between two states with an exponential distribution of decision times and a given average decision time . when coupled to the other individuals of the network ,",
    "the global distribution for the time intervals between decisions is determined to be inverse power - law @xcite . in this latter case",
    "the power - law index of the survival probability is a measure of the complexity of the underlying dynamics determining whether that process is non - stationary and non - ergodic @xcite . in section [ subordination ]",
    "the dmm network dynamics is incorporated into that of an individual element through a process known as subordination . in order to formalize the subordination process",
    "we introduce the concept of subjective time to distinguish between clock time that determines the activities of the network and operational or subjective time that determines the activities of the individual .",
    "the subordination process results in the two - state master equation of the dmm being replaced by a fractional master equation for the individual whose solution is shown to be a mittag - leffler function in section [ subordination ] .",
    "this predicted behavior of the single element dynamics is compared with the numerical results from the dmm implemented on a two - dimensional lattice and found to be in excellent agreement . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we draw some conclusions .",
    "the dmm realized on a complex networks represents the dynamics of the probability for an individual to be in either of the two states : yes or no , up or down , on or off .",

    "moreover , real - world networks have finite numbers of elements .",
    "it is therefore useful to examine how strongly the mean field solutions are violated when we relax these constraints .",
    "the stability condition can be violated in at least two different ways .",

    "we can no longer make the mean field approximation and the dynamic picture stemming from the above master equation is radically changed .",

    "the random fluctuations resulting from the finite size of the network induces transitions between the two states of the potential well .",
    "consequently , for a network with a finite but large number of elements the phase synchronization of eq.([ideal ] ) is not stable and the stochastic langevin equation eq.([stochastic ideal ] ) determines the dynamics of the network .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuations can drive the particle from one well of the potential to the other when its amplitude is sufficient to traverse the barrier separating the wells .",

    "the deviation of the individual survival probability from the exponential form in figure [ fig_lattice]c appears to be modest when compared with the dramatically greater deviation of the survival probability of the global variable from the exponential as depicted in figure [ fig_lattice]d .",

    "frame the temporal behavior of an element is regular and evolves exactly according to the ticks of a clock leading to the exponential",
    ". therefore it is assumed that the trajectory of a network s element in operational time is well defined and given by @xmath89 , which is the solution given by eq.([phi_solution ] ) .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to point out that this notion of two different times was introduced into psychology in the middle nineteenth century and lead to the general weber - fechner law .",
    "it has been further developed in a contemporary setting to explain the observation of @xmath90 noise in cognition by discriminating between subjective and objective times , that being operational and chronological time , respectively .    in operational time",
    "an element s behavior appears ordinary , but to an experimenter observing the elements from outside the network their temporal behavior appears erratic , evolving in time then abruptly freezing in different states for extended time periods . because of the random nature of the experimental or chronological time evolution of the elements the subordination process involves an ensemble average over many realizations of the element s dynamics each evolving according to its own internal clock , independent of one another . making an ensemble average over a large number of realizations results in a smooth average trajectory , which is equivalent to the fractional trajectory .    to find the average behavior we move from the operational time solution to the experimental time solution adopting the subordination interpretation .",

    "consequently , the strategy is to consider the asymptotic forms of the solution , which was done by examining the solutions to the fractional langevin equation given by eq.([solution2 ] ) .",
    "we find that the properties of the fluctuations change as the control parameter is varied from the subcritical , critical and supercritical regions .          in all three regions of dmm dynamics , subcritical , critical and supercritical ,",
    "the single elements used in the evaluation of the probability difference @xmath129 were selected at random among all nodes of the lattice .",
    "the calculations were done on a @xmath130 node two - dimensional lattice , with nearest neighbor interactions . the time - dependent average solution calculated over an ensemble of randomly chosen individuals",
    "is depicted in figure [ fig_difference ] , where the average is taken over @xmath131 independent realizations of the dynamics .",

    "consequently the influence of the network on the behavior of the individual in this case would be essentially that of uncorrelated random noise and therefore would not qualitatively change from the poisson nature of an isolated individual .",
    "however this is not the case for other values of the inverse power - law index ; in the subcritical region the fitted value of the scaling index is @xmath134 .",
    "thus , the dynamic behavior of the network results in a stretched exponential autocorrelation for the dynamics of the individual    @xmath135 ^{\\mu -1}}{\\gamma \\left ( \\mu \\right ) } \\right ) . \\label{stretched}\\ ] ]    note that the early time behavior of the mittag - leffler function is the indicated stretched exponential . on the figure [ fig_difference]a , the region where the black dashes of the mittag - leffler function fit diverge from the data is the onset of the inverse power - law tail of the mittag - leffler function .",
    "an exponential truncation of the mittag - leffler function would fit the data throughout its domain .",
    "the rational for a truncated mittag - leffler function will be taken up elsewhere .",
    "the fitting of the analytic solution at early times to the dmm numerically generated curves is certainly very good in the subcritical domain with @xmath136 .    as the critical point is approached from the subcritical region the random influence of fluctuations",
    "are diminished as would be expected due to the formation of clusters as the network undergoes a phase transition and encounters critical slowing down .",
    "the plunging stretched exponential that was observed in the subcritical region as seen in figure [ difference]a is replaced with a more gently decreasing function .",
    "the time - dependent average solution of a randomly chosen individual in the critical regime is depicted in figure [ difference]b .",
    "it is evident by comparing these data with the curve in figure [ difference]a that the average solution does not decrease as quickly in time and there is less variability asymptotically in time .",
    "this behavior is reflected in the value of the power - law index which is determined to be @xmath137 with a quality of fit given by @xmath138 .",
    "note how well separated the solution is from the exponential function given by the light grey dashed curve .",
    "but here again an exponential truncation of the mittag - leffler function might provide a better overall fit to the data .    in the supercritical region of the control parameter",
    "it is evident from the fit of the analytic solution to the data depicted in figure [ difference]c that the solution extends far beyond that found in either the subcritical or critical domains with the mittag - leffler function solution extending far into the inverse power - law region . here",
    "the power - law index is fitted with the value @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "the measured inverse power - law index is very close to that obtained for the global survival probability obtained from the numerical calculation of the dmm lattice network .",
    "in summary the last few years have witnessed substantial attention focused on the role of criticality @xcite to explain the function of complex networks , from flocks of birds @xcite , to neural networks @xcite to the brain @xcite . at criticality , the short - range links of ising - like cooperative models are converted into long - range interactions turning a set of @xmath0 distinct elements into an organized network behaving as a single individual with extended cognition @xcite .",
    "a complex network at criticality generates 1/f noise @xcite , which is thought to be of relevance for cognition @xcite , with the interesting property of maximizing information transport @xcite .",
    "moreover the network dynamics has a subtle but profound influence on the behavior of each individual within the network .",
    "the numerical solution of the dmm on a @xmath130 lattice with elements at each of the nodes and with nearest neighbor interactions gives rise to an inverse power - law survival probability for the global variable introduced in section [ dmm ] .",
    "using the theory of subordination , that being the time experienced by an individual , with the influence of the network entering into the individual s dynamics through the distribution of critical events , the dynamics of an individual is determined by a fractional langevin equation .",
    "the explicit form of the fractional langevin equation depends on whether the network dynamics is in the subcritical , critical or supercritical domains . in all three domains",
    "the mittag - leffler function solution to the fractional langevin equation is sufficient to describe the dynamic response of an individual to the other @xmath141 dynamic elements of the network . in the subcritical and critical domains the solutions",
    "could be modified to include truncations effects evident in the numerical data .",
    "the lesson to be learned from the combination of computation and analysis presented herein is that complex networks of finite size whose dynamics are members of the ising universality class , such as described by the dmm , have an analytic not just a numerical description .",
    "instead of confining the dynamic description to that of the macroscopic variable , that being the global or average state of the network , one can also investigate how individual members of the network respond to the influence of the network as a whole . if we consider the fluctuations in the global dynamics to be microscopic , and the potential of the global variable to be macroscopic",
    ", then the real - time dynamic description of the individuals is mesoscopic . in general",
    "the mesoscopic dynamics can be described by a fractional stochastic differential equation .",
    "coupling two or more such fractional stochastic equations to model the across - scale coupling within the brain depicted in figure [ fig_markram ] suggests itself .",
