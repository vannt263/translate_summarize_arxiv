    "a stated goal of international metrology organizations and national metrology institutes ( nmis ) , including the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , is to make all measurements directly traceable to the international system of units ( si ) . whenever possible , we would like these metrology techniques to be able to make an absolute measurement of a physical quantity of interest plus any measurement based on the atom to provide a direct si traceability path and hence enable absolute measurements of physical quantities .",
    "measurement standards based on atoms have been used for a number of years for a wide array of applications ; most notable are time , frequency , and length .",
    "there is a need to extend these atom - based techniques to other physical quantities , such as electric ( e ) fields . in recent work ,",
    "we ( and others ) have demonstrated a fundamentally new approach for self - calibrated si - traceable e - field measurements with the capability of fine spatial resolution ( including sub - wavelength resolution ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this new approach utilizes the concept of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "consider a sample of stationary four - level atoms illuminated by a single weak (  probe \" ) light field , as depicted in fig  [ 4level ] . in this approach",
    ", one laser is used to probe the response of the atoms and a second laser is used to excite the atoms to a rydberg state ( the `` coupling '' laser ) . in the presence of the coupling laser , the atoms become transparent to the probe laser transmission ( this is the concept of eit ) .",
    "the coupling laser wavelength is chosen such that the atom is at a high enough principle - quantum state such that an rf field can cause an atomic transition . the rf transition in this four - level atomic system causes autler - townes ( at ) splitting of the transmission spectrum ( the eit signal ) for a probe laser .",
    "this splitting of the probe laser spectrum is easily measured and is directly proportional to the applied rf e - field amplitude ( through planck s constant and the dipole moment of the atom ) . by measuring this splitting",
    ", we can directly measure the rf e - field strength with the following @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the measured splitting and @xmath2 , @xmath3 is planck s constant and @xmath4 is the atomic dipole moment of the rf transition .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the wavelengths of the probe and coupling lasers , respectively ) accounts for the doppler mismatch of the probe and coupling lasers @xcite .",
    "we consider this type of measurement of the e - field strength a direct si - traceable self - calibrated measurement in that it is related to planck s constant ( which will become an si - defined quantity by standard bodies in the near future ) and only requires a frequency measurement ( @xmath1 , which can be measured very accurately ) .",
    "a typical measured eit signal from this technique is shown in fig .",
    "[ eitfig1 ] for the case with and without rf applied . the experimental setup and details",
    "are given below .",
    "application of rf ( via a horn antenna placed 318  mm from the vapor cell ) at 13.404  ghz couples two high laying rydberg states and splits the eit peak as shown in the solid curve in the figure .",
    "we measured the at splitting ( @xmath1 ) of the eit signal in the probe spectrum for a range of rf source levels , and determine the e - field amplitude using ( [ mage2 ] ) .",
    "these values are also shown in the figure .",
    "+   +   +    the uncertainties of these types of measurements are currently being investigated @xcite . with that said , for a new measurement method to be accepted by nmis , the accuracy of the approach must be assessed . by performing simultaneous eit measurements with two different atomic species in the same vapor cell with coincident ( overlapping ) optical fields exposed to the identical e - field",
    ", we can assess various aspects of the technique .",
    "in effect , this allows us to perform the same measurement in two different laboratories simultaneously , providing two independent measurements of the same e - field .",
    "there are subtle aspects of this technique that using two different atoms allows us to address and performing such dual atom experiments help in understanding systematic effects and uncertainties of this approach .",
    "for example , these experiments will help in assessing the accuracy of the dipole moment calculations of the various atoms . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate simultaneous e - field measurement via eit using both cesium atoms ( @xmath8cs ) and rubidium-85 ( @xmath9rb ) atoms in the same vapor cell .",
    "we discuss various aspects of these coincident tests by measuring e - fields in the 9.2  ghz , 11.6  ghz , and 13.4  ghz frequency range .",
    "the broadband nature of this technique is due to the large number of possible rydberg states that can exhibit a large response to an rf source @xcite . in order to perform these types of simultaneous measurements ,",
    "we need to choose states for @xmath8cs and @xmath9rb that have similar rf transition frequencies . while there are a large number of possible atomic states with rf transition frequencies ,",
    "several of these have small atomic dipole moments . since the measurement splitting ( @xmath1 ) is directly proportional to the atomic dipole moments , we need to use rf transitions with large dipole moments .",
    "the four classes of rf transitions corresponding to @xmath10-@xmath11 , @xmath10-@xmath12 , @xmath13-@xmath14 , and @xmath13-@xmath15 have the largest dipole moments and are good choices for these experiments .",

    "if the rf is detuned from the on - resonant rf transition , the measurement splitting @xmath1 ( or @xmath46 ) increases from the on - resonant at splitting by the following @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the rf detuning ( @xmath49 ; @xmath16 is the on - resonance rf transition and @xmath50 is the frequency of the rf source ) and @xmath46 is the separation of the two peaks with no rf detuning ( i.e. , the on - resonant at splitting or when @xmath51 ) . in order for us to compare measurements for the two different atomic species , we need to correct for the situation where the two species can have slightly different rf transition frequencies .",
    "alternatively , we can assume that the rf source produces the same @xmath40-field at the vapor cell for the slightly difference frequencies ( within the @xmath52 ) and then perform on - resonant measurements for each of the two different species .",
    "we have verified that the rf source produces constant output power for a given @xmath52 , and that the losses in the cable feeding the antenna and the antenna parameters are constant for a given @xmath52 .",

    "it is difficult to measure and/or detect splitting in the eit signal . since the measured @xmath1 ( or @xmath46 ) is directly proportional to the product of `` @xmath58 '' ( i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ mage2 ] ) , when the e - field strength is weak and @xmath4 is small , the ability to measure @xmath1 becomes problematic ) .",
    "for this particular set of @xmath8cs and @xmath9rb states , the dipole moment for @xmath9rb is twice as large as the dipole moment for @xmath8cs , and hence the @xmath9rb atoms can measure a @xmath83 weaker field .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ efield11ghz ] where the smallest field for the @xmath8cs atoms that can be detected is 0.8  v / m and the smallest field for the @xmath9rb atoms that can be detected is 0.4  v / m .",
    "the maximum detectable field for each atom is limited partially by the methods in which the probe lasers are scanned .",
    "we use acoustic - optic modulators ( aoms ) to scan the probe laser and as such once at splitting ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) becomes greater than the aom scan range , an @xmath40-field can not be detected .",
    "since the dipole moment for @xmath9rb is twice as large as the dipole for @xmath8cs for this particular set of @xmath8cs and @xmath9rb states , the @xmath9rb atoms will reach this scan limit first , as indicated in the figure .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrated simultaneous @xmath40-field measurement via eit using both cesium and rubidium in the same vapor cell .",
    "performing such a dual experiment helps quantify various aspects of this type of @xmath40-field metrology approach , which are important to understand when establishing an international measurement standard for an e - field strength and is a necessary step for this method to be accepted as a standard calibration technique .",
    "for example , these experiments help in assessing the accuracy in the calculation of the dipole moment of the various atoms , where we showed the difference between the measured and theoretical values of the sensitivity ratio r was @xmath75 or less for the three cases given here .",
    "this dual atomic species experiment also allows us to investigate the possibility that the two atomic species could interact with each other when they are both excited to high - rydberg states . to address this possibility",
    ", we performed a set of experiments in a pure vapor cell , and two separate experiments in a cell with two atomic species . in the separate dual cell experiments , we performed measurements on one atomic species with the probe and coupling lasers for other atomic species blocked from entering the vapor cell ( in effect , one atom at ground state and the other at a high - rydberg state ) . from these experiments ,",
    "the two different atomic species appear to not significantly interact when they are both excited to high - rydberg states ( at least for the types of measurements of interest in this paper ) .",
    "finally , the rf detuning results presented here also help quantify the accuracy of reported quantum defects , which are used in various aspects of these types of measurements .",
