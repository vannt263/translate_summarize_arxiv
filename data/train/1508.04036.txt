    "there is already a considerable but widely varying literature on the application of category theory to the life and cognitive sciences  such as the work of robert rosen ( @xcite , @xcite ) and his followers as well as andre ehresmann and jean - paul vanbremeersch @xcite and their commentators .",
    "the approach taken here is based on a specific use of the characteristic concepts of category theory , namely universal mapping properties .",
    "one such approach in the literature is that of franois magnan and gonzalo reyes which emphasizes that `` category theory provides means to circumscribe and study what is universal in mathematics and other scientific disciplines . ''",
    "their intended field of application is cognitive science .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we may even suggest that universals of the mind may be expressed by means of universal properties in the theory of categories and much of the work done up to now in this area seems to bear out this suggestion ....    by discussing the process of counting in some detail , we give evidence that this universal ability of the human mind may be conveniently conceptualized in terms of this theory of universals which is category theory . @xcite _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    another current approach that emphasizes universal mapping properties ( `` universal constructions '' ) is that of s. phillips , w. h. wilson , and g. s. halford ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the focus on universals , the approach here is distinctive in the use of heteromorphisms  which are object - to - object morphisms between objects if different categories  in contrast to the usual homomorphisms or homs between objects in the same category . by explicitly adding heteromorphisms to the usual homs - only presentation of category theory",
    ", this approach can directly represent interactions between the objects of different categories ( intuitively , between an organism and the environment ) .",
    "but it is still early days , and many approaches need to be tried to find out `` where theory lives . ''",
    "before developing the concept of a brain functor , we need to consider the related concept of a pair of adjoint functors , an adjunction .",
    "the developers of category theory , saunders maclane and samuel eilenberg , famously said that categories were defined in order to define functors , and functors were defined in order to define natural transformations @xcite .",
    "a few years later , the concept of universal constructions or universal mapping properties was isolated ( @xcite and @xcite ) . adjoints were defined a decade later by daniel kan @xcite and the realization of their ubiquity ( `` adjoint functors arise everywhere '' maclane : cwm ) and their foundational importance has steadily increased over time ( lawvere @xcite and lambek @xcite )",
    ". now it would perhaps not be too much of an exaggeration to see categories , functors , and natural transformations as the prelude to defining adjoint functors .",
    "as steven awodey put it :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the notion of adjoint functor applies everything that we have learned up to now to unify and subsume all the different universal mapping properties that we have encountered , from free groups to limits to exponentials .",
    "but more importantly , it also captures an important mathematical phenomenon that is invisible without the lens of category theory .",

    "the main point of this paper is that those atoms , the left and right representations can be recombined in a new way to define a `` recombinant construction '' cognate to an adjunction , and that is the concept of a `` brain functor . ''",
    "in many adjunctions , the important fact is expressed by either the left or right representation ( e.g. , the ump for the product functor or for the free - group functor considered in the appendix ) , with no need for the `` auxiliary device '' ( such as a diagonal or forgetful functor ) of the other representation used to express the adjunction in a het - free manner .",
    "another payoff from analyzing the important but molecular concept of an adjunction into two atomic representations is that we can then reassemble those atomic parts in a new way to define the cognate concept speculatively named a `` brain functor . ''",
    "the basic intuition is to think of one category @xmath57 in a representation as the `` environment '' and the other category @xmath58 as an `` organism . '' instead of representations within _ each _ category of the hets going _ one way _ between the categories ( as in an adjunction ) , suppose the hets going _ both ways _ were represented within _ one _ of the categories ( the `` organism '' ) .    intuitively , a het from the environment to the organism is say , a visual or auditory stimulus . then a left representation would play the role of the brain in providing the re - cognition or perception ( expressed by the intentionality - of - perception slogan : `` seeing is seeing - as '' ) of the stimulus as a perception of , say , a tree where the internal re - cognition is represented by the homomorphism @xmath65 inside the `` organism '' category .",
    "fig7-brain-left-rep.eps    figure 7 : perceiving brain presented as a left representation .    perhaps not surprisingly , this mathematically models the old philosophical theme in the platonic tradition that external stimuli do not give knowledge ; the stimuli only trigger the internal perception , recognition , or recollection ( as in plato s _ meno _ ) that is knowledge .",

    "the main conclusion of the paper is that this concept of a brain functor seems to fit very well as an abstract and conceptual but non - trivial description of the dual universal functions of a brain , perception ( using the sensory or afferent systems ) and action ( using the motor or efferent systems ) .",
