    "the discovery of the higgs - like boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is certainly a great success of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "though not completely established , this particle looks very much like the sm higgs boson .",
    "however , atlas collaboration @xcite results for the @xmath1 signal both for the production in the gluon - gluon fusion mode as well as from the associated production with the vector boson gives significant enhancement compared to the sm prediction .",
    "the cms collaboration results for the same modes gives modest suppression in both channels .",
    "a combined fit @xcite ( admittedly by the theoreticians ) fitting all channel data from the lhc as well as tevatron gives again significant enhancement in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "it is not clear at this time if this is a signal of new physics or not .",
    "however , any new physics which can fit the data better is worth exploring . on the theoretical vein",
    ", there is no fundamental reason why there should be only one sm higgs boson , or only chiral fermions .",
    "in fact , most extensions of the sm includes more higgs bosons , and also non - chiral fermions .",
    "any reasonably motivated model which gives good agreement with the higgs data , as well as predict new physics that can be tested at the lhc is worth exploring .",
    "it is in this spirit , we consider a model which extends the sm by including down type vector - like quark ( @xmath2 ) @xcite and add a real singlet higgs boson ( @xmath3 ) @xcite to the scalar sector . in this model",
    ", we are able to fit the lhc data from observed higgs final states , especially the @xmath1 channel better because of the additional contribution in the loop coming from a new colored particle .",
    "the down type vector - like quark can be pair produced with good enough rates at the lhc .",
    "the heavy quark in our case will decay dominantly into the b - quark and the scalar singlet higgs .",
    "this scalar higgs then dominantly decays to @xmath4 , and @xmath5 decays dominantly to @xmath0 .",
    "thus from the pair production of the of @xmath6 , and from the subsequent decay of the two top quarks in the leptonic mode ( via @xmath0 ) , we get the final state with six @xmath7 ( three @xmath7 and three @xmath8 ) , two same sign charged leptons ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 .",
    "we find that for a wide range of the parameter space involving coefficients in the higgs potential , and for a wide range of mass for the vector - like quark , such an exotic final state yields observable event rates at the 14 tev run of lhc , even with a modest luminosity of @xmath12 .",
    "the sm background for such a final state will be too suppressed and totally negligible .",
    "thus the observation of any events for such a final state will be a signal for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the gauge symmetry of our model is the same as the sm , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath13 .",
    "we extend the matter sector of the sm with an additional down type vector - like quark , @xmath2 and the scalar sector with a real scalar singlet field , @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangian of our model is given by [ eq : lag ]    =  & _ sm-|d(i^d_-m_d)d - f_d|dds ,    where @xmath14 is the bare mass term for the vector - like quark ( vlq ) while we have also added a gauge - singlet yukawa interaction term for the vector like quark with the new scalar singlet whose coupling strength is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the scalar potential is given by [ eq : potential ]    v(h , s ) = & -_1 ^ 2(h^ h)-_2 ^ 2s^2 + _",
    "1(h^ h)^2 + _ 2 s^4 + & + _ 3(h^",
    "h ) s^2 + _ 1s^3 + _ 2(h^ h ) s  .    where the parameters @xmath16 and , @xmath17 have mass dimensions .",
    "the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry is spontaneously broken when the neutral component of the higgs doublet @xmath18 gets a _ vacuum expectation value _ ( vev ) . in the unitary gauge the shifted vev s of the @xmath18 and @xmath3",
    "can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are vev s of corresponding scalar fields .",
    "note that the vector - like quark gets a bare mass as well as a mass from its yukawa interaction with the singlet higgs .    minimizing the scalar potential",
    ", we get the following constraints among the parameters given by : [ eq : potential - cond ]    & _ 1 ^ 2 = _ 1 v_h^2 + _ 2 v_s + _ 3 v_s^2 , _ 2 ^ 2 = + v_h^2+_1v_s+2 _ 2v_s^2 , + & _ 1 > 0 , 3_1 v_s+8_2v_s^2- > 0 , _ 2 + 2_3v_s > 0 .",
    "in addition to the constraints in eq .",
    "[ eq : potential - cond ] one needs to assume @xmath22 so that the potential is bounded from below for large values of the singlet field . the scalar mass squared matrix in @xmath23 basis",
    "is given by [ eq : massm ] ^2=    2_1 v_h^2 & v_h(2_3v_s+_2 ) + v_h(2_3v_s+_2 ) &  8_2v_s^2 + 3_1v_s-    . the fields @xmath24 can be expressed in terms of the physical fields @xmath25 as    h_0 = &   h+ s + s_0 = & -h+ s.    the mixing angle @xmath26 is given by 2=  .",
    "where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 element of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ eq : massm ] .",
    "the vlq , in principle can also mix with other sm quarks and assuming that the vector - like heavy quark , d dominantly couples to only the b quark in its yukawa interactions with the singlet @xmath3 and the higgs doublet @xmath18 , we can write the most general gauge invariant yukawa interaction and mass terms , that lead to a mixing of the vlq with the @xmath7 quark , given by [ eq : vlmixing ]    -_bd= &  y_b|q_3l b_r h + m_d|d_l d_r + f_d|d_l d_r s + f_q h |q_3l d_r h + &   + y_bd^*|d_l b_r s + m_bd |d_lb_r+_h.c . _ +    in eq .  [ eq : vlmixing ] @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are yukawa couplings , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are bare mass terms in the lagrangian . using the above lagrangian ,",
    "we have calculated the mass eigenstates from the mixing matrix for the @xmath7 and @xmath2 , and their left and right mixing angles ( @xmath34 ) using bi - unitary transformations .",
    "note that the mixing angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constrained by observables involving @xmath7 quarks , in interactions within the sm as well as the entries in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which we have used in our calculations .",
    "we now consider the final states that highlight a very interesting and unique signal arising from the pair productions of these vector - like @xmath2 quarks and their subsequent decays .    in fig.[fig",
    ": cs ] we plot the leading order ( lo ) production cross - section of @xmath6 at @xmath37 tev center - of - mass energies at the lhc .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath38 has been set to the mass of @xmath2 , @xmath39 , and we have used the cteq6@xmath401  @xcite parton distribution function ( pdf ) set . the model is also implemented in calchep  @xcite and the results have been found in good agreement with our parton level monte carlo generator .     at the lhc as a function of vlq mass @xmath39 , at center - of - mass energies , @xmath41 and @xmath42 tev .",
    "we have chosen the scale as @xmath43 , the mass of the heavy vlq.,width=460,height=268 ]    the production cross - section at 8 tev center - of - mass energy is above @xmath44 fb at mass @xmath45 gev and drops below @xmath46 fb after @xmath47 gev .",
    "there already exist search limits by both the cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations on such exotic quarks .",
    "however , the search limits crucially depend on how these exotic quarks decay , and most of the limits assume the decays of the bottom - like exotics in to the @xmath48 channel with 100% branching probability ( and/or only considering @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 decay channels ) . in this model , the mixing of the vlq quark , @xmath2 with the sm down - type quarks will dictate its decay properties .",
    "in our case , by construction its mixing is expected to be dominant with the @xmath52-quark .",
    "the mixing angles , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , also allow two decay channels , namely @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "both is a direct consequence of the extra mixing in the quark sector .",
    "the singlet scalar field also mixes with the sm higgs doublet .",
    "this mixing @xmath26 induces two more decay channels for the vlq , namely @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    to highlight the signal in our model we scanned over values for the free parameters in our model .",
    "the range of the parameter space scanned are shown in table i where we have listed the parameters appearing in the scalar potential and in table ii , where we list the free parameters that constitute the yukawa and mass terms for the vlq and @xmath7 quark .    .illustrating the range over which the free parameters of the scalar sector are varied",
    ". the doublet vev @xmath59 is fixed at @xmath60 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb : cs_times_br ]    finally we are now ready to discuss the unique final state signal that arises in our model which is observable at the 14 tev lhc with modest luminosity and which has negligible sm background .",
    "this follows from the pair production of @xmath6 , and their subsequent decays following the decay chains given below : @xmath61 as can be seen from the parameter scan in fig [ fig : d_branching ] , for @xmath2 mass above @xmath62 gev , @xmath57 decay dominates over other decays .",
    "thus @xmath6 pair productions give rise to ( @xmath63 ) ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "also , as can be seen from fig.[fig : s_branching ] , for @xmath65 mass above @xmath66 gev , the decay @xmath67 dominate over the other decay modes .",
    "thus for a good range of parameter space allowed in our model , the final state from the @xmath68 production is @xmath69 ( where one @xmath7 is @xmath8 ) .",
    "the branching ratio for the @xmath5 s for the decays to @xmath70 is essentially one .",
    "thus the final state is @xmath71 .",
    "now we consider either two @xmath72 decay or two @xmath73 decay leptonically to @xmath9 or @xmath10 plus neutrinos . the other two @xmath74 s decay hadronically or leptonically .",
    "thus the resulting final state signal is six high @xmath75 @xmath7-jets , two high @xmath75 same sign charged leptons plus missing energy due to the neutrinos ( where we do not trigger on the jets or charged leptons coming from the decays of the other @xmath76 ) .",
    "let us now calculate this signal using our production cross - sections for the two benchmark points @xmath77 and @xmath78 given in given in table [ tab : branching ] .",
    "for example , @xmath77 results in @xmath79 gev which has @xmath80 cross - section at @xmath81 tev lhc .",
    "this cross - section when multiplied with the relevant branching ratios given in table [ tab : branching ] , @xmath82 , gives @xmath83 . this need to be multiplied by the leptonic branching ratios of the two same sign @xmath74 s decaying to @xmath9 or @xmath10 plus neutrinos , which is @xmath84 . finally we have to multiply by the b - tagging efficiency @xcite of each of the six @xmath7 s which is @xmath85 for high @xmath75 @xmath7 .",
    "thus the resulting cross - section for the final state with six @xmath7 s and two same sign charged leptons is @xmath86 giving a value of @xmath87 .",
    "note that we have considered both final states with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus with a modest @xmath12 luminosity , we expect @xmath90 such events . for our benchmark point @xmath78 , similar calculation yields @xmath91 events .",
    "the sm background for this final state is negligible .",
    "note that what we have presented here as an estimate of the signal events is just a crude estimate to highlight that the signal events are not negligible .",
    "however , as one would expect , after putting some basic acceptance cuts required to trigger on the different final states , the rates would be smaller . even then",
    ", we do not expect the suppression to be more than 4050% of the estimated event rates and this still gives us significantly large and observable event rate for the signal , in the absence of any sm background .",
    "we have proposed a simple extension of the sm by extending the higgs sector with a real singlet higgs ( @xmath3 ) , and the matter sector with a down type vector - like quark ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we have scanned the parameter space of the extended higgs sector and the extended fermionic sector .",
    "there is a good range of the parameter space where all the experimental data from lep , tevatron and the lhc ( including all the data of the measured cross - sections time the branching ratios of the observed 125 gev higgs ) can be satisfied . in this allowed parameter space , we found a wide range in which a unique final state with 6 b and two same sign charged leptons plus missing energy which will be well observable in the upcoming runs of the lhc , even with a modest luminosity of @xmath12 .",
    "the sm background for such a final state is negligible and thus any observation of such a final state will be a clear signal of new physics beyond the standard model .",
