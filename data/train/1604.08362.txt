    "among the great variety of the works devoted to random motions at finite speed in the euclidean spaces @xmath8 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the markovian case and @xcite , @xcite for different non - markovian cases ) , the markov random flight in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 is , undoubtedly , the most difficult and hard to study .",
    "while in the low even - dimensional spaces @xmath9 and @xmath10 one managed to obtain the distributions of the motions in an explicit form ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) , in the important three - dimensional case only a few results are known .",
    "the absolutely continuous part of the transition density of the symmetric markov random flight with unit speed in the euclidean space @xmath1 was presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formulas ( 1.3 ) and ( 4.21 ) therein ) .",
    "it has an extremely complicated form of an integral with variable limits whose integrand involves inverse hyperbolic tangent function .",
    "this formula has so complicated form that can not even be evaluated by means of standard computer environments .",
    "moreover , the lack of the speed parameter in this formula impoverishes somewhat the model because it does not allow to study the limiting behaviour of the motion under various scaling conditions ( under kac s condition , for example ) .",
    "the presence of both parameters ( i.e. the speed and the intensity of switchings ) in any process of markov random flight makes it , undoubtedly , the most adequate and realistic model for describing the finite - velocity diffusion in the euclidean spaces .",
    "these parameters can not be considered as independent because they are connected with each other through the time ( namely , the speed is the distance passed _ per unit of time _ and the intensity is the mean number of switchings _ per unit of time _ ) .",
    "another question concerning the density presented in @xcite is the infinite discontinuity at the origin @xmath11 . while the infinite discontinuity of the transition density on the border of the diffusion area is a quite natural property in some euclidean spaces of low dimensions ( see @xcite for the euclidean plane @xmath12 and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the second term of formulas ( 1.3 ) and ( 4.21 ) ) , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 3.12 ) ) in the space @xmath1 ) , the discontinuity at the origin looks somewhat strange and hard to explain .",
    "the difficulty of analysing the three - dimensional markov random flight and , on the other hand , the great theoretical and applied importance of the problem of describing the finite - velocity diffusion in the space @xmath1 suggest to look for other methods of studying this model .",
    "that is why various asymptotic theorems yielding a good approximation would be a fairly desirable aim of the research .",
    "such asymptotic results could be obtained by using the characteristic functions technique . in the case of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight",
    "some important results for its characteristic functions were obtained . in particular , the closed - form expression for the laplace transform of the characteristic function was obtained by different methods in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formulas ( 1.6 ) and ( 5.8 ) ) ( for unit speed ) and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 45 ) ) , @xcite ( for arbitrary speed ) . a general relation for the conditional characteristic functions of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight conditioned by the number of changes of direction ,",
    "was given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 3.8 ) ) .",
    "the key point in these formulas is the possibility of evaluating the inverse laplace transforms of the powers of the inverse tangent functions in the complex right half - plane .",
    "this is the basic idea of deriving the series representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three changes of direction given in section 3 .",
    "based on these representations , an asymptotic formula , as time @xmath5 , for the unconditional characteristic function is obtained in section 4 and the error in this formula has the order @xmath6 .",
    "the inverse fourier transformation of the unconditional characteristic function yields an asymptotic formula for the transition density of the process which is presented in section 5 .",
    "this formula shows that the density is discontinuous on the border , but it is continuous at the origin @xmath11 , as it must be .",
    "the unexpected and interesting peculiarity is that the conditional density corresponding to two changes of direction contains a term having an infinite discontinuity on the border of the diffusion area .",
    "from this fact it follows that such conditional density is discontinuous itself on the border and this differs the 3d - model from its 2d - counterpart where only the conditional density of the single change of direction has an infinite discontinuity on the border .",
    "the error in the obtained asymptotic formula has the order @xmath6 . in section 6",
    "we estimate the accuracy of the asymptotic formula and show that it gives a good approximation on small time intervals whose lengths depend on the intensity of switchings .",
    "finally , in appendices we prove a series of auxiliary lemmas that have been used in our analysis .",
    "consider the stochastic motion of a particle that , at the initial time instant @xmath13 , starts from the origin @xmath14 of the euclidean space @xmath1 and moves with some constant speed @xmath15 ( note that @xmath15 is treated as the constant norm of the velocity ) .",
    "the initial direction is a random three - dimensional vector with uniform distribution on the unit sphere @xmath16 the motion is controlled by a homogeneous poisson process @xmath17 of rate @xmath3 as follows . at each poissonian instant ,",
    "the particle instantaneously takes on a new random direction distributed uniformly on @xmath18 independently of its previous motion and keeps moving with the same speed @xmath15 until the next poisson event occurs , then it takes on a new random direction again and so on .",
    "let @xmath19 be the particle s position at time @xmath20 which is referred to as the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight .",

    "for arbitrary fixed @xmath20 , the distribution @xmath26 consists of two components .",
    "the singular component corresponds to the case when no poisson events occur on the time interval @xmath27 and it is concentrated on the sphere @xmath28 in this case , at time instant @xmath29 , the particle is located on the sphere @xmath30 and the probability of this event is @xmath31    if at least one poisson event occurs on the time interval @xmath32 , then the particle is located strictly inside the ball @xmath33 and the probability of this event is @xmath34 the part of the distribution @xmath26 corresponding to this case is concentrated in the interior @xmath35 of the ball @xmath33 and forms its absolutely continuous component .",
    "let @xmath36 be the density of distribution @xmath37 .",
    "it has the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the density ( in the sense of generalized functions ) of the singular component of @xmath26 concentrated on the sphere @xmath30 and @xmath40 is the density of the absolutely continuous component of @xmath26 concentrated in @xmath41 .",
    "the singular part of density ( [ struc2 ] ) is given by the formula : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dirac delta - function .",

    "is explicitly given by ( [ denss ] ) , then our efforts are mostly concentrated on deriving the respective asymptotic formulas for the absolutely continuous component ( [ densac ] ) of the density .",
    "our main tool is the characteristic functions technique because , as it was mentioned above , some closed - form expressions for the characteristic functions ( both conditional and unconditional ones ) of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight @xmath4 are known .",
    "in this section we obtain the series representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three changes of direction .",
