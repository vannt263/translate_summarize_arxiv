    "terahertz ( thz ) region of the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum refers to the frequency range between the mid infrared and the microwave region ( 0.3 thz - 10 thz ) .",
    "this em region has a lot of promising applications in various areas of science and technologies include astronomy , broadband communication , pollution monitoring , poison gas sensing , etc . @xcite . in spite of the potential applications , this region of the em spectrum is yet to be fully exploited , due to the limited availability of device sources and detectors @xcite . over the past decade , terahertz",
    "science and technology has advanced considerably with both optical - bench - based systems and solid state quantum cascade lasers @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of these quantum cascade thz sources is low working temperature , making it difficult to maintain population inversion at room temperature @xcite . so far the highest temperature attained for a thz source operating at 3 thz frequency is 160 k @xcite .",
    "creating a compact reliable source of thz radiation that could operate at room temperature still remains one of the most formidable challenges of contemporary applied physics .",
    "most recently , carbon nanotube has been identified for thz technology due to its superb physical properties .",
    "different proposals of carbon nanotubes for thz applications have been made ; that ranges from frequency multipliers @xcite , thz amplifies @xcite , switches @xcite to antennas @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotube ( cnt ) is single layer nanometer - size cylinder made of carbon atoms .",
    "the cylinder has no bulk atoms , only surface atoms .",
    "it is a layer of graphene seamlessly rolled into cylinder .",
    "cnts have intriguing physical properties ( mechanical , electrical , optical , etc . ) due to their unique structure ; combine with of one - dimensional solid state characteristics with molecular dimensions @xcite .",
    "these properties vary with each cnt fundamental indices , ( @xmath6 ) which specify the diameter and wrapping angle as the graphene sheet seamlessly wrapped into a cnt . as @xmath7 and @xmath8 vary , conduction ranges from metallic to semiconducting @xcite , with @xmath9 been metallic and @xmath10 been semiconducting .",
    "the band gap of the semiconducting cnts which is inverse diameter ( @xmath11 ) dependent , ranges from 0.2 ev to 2 ev with @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 ( @xmath14)@xmath15 is the nanotube diameter and @xmath16 nm is graphene lattice constant .",
    "the peculiarity of cnts ( e.g. , strong nonparabolic dispersion law ) raises the question of whether these structures could be used for high - order harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "different theoretical models and experimental techniques are being pursued to demonstrate the feasibility of cnt for thz applications@xcite - @xcite .",
    "these ranges from thz generation cherenkov - type emitters base on cnts and hot electrons in quasimetallic cnt ( @xmath17 with @xmath18 as a non - zero interger ) , frequency multiplication in chiral - nanotube - base superlattices controlled by a transverse electric field , and thz radiation detection and emission by armchair nanotubes in a strong magnetic field @xcite , ab initio molecular dynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "cnt capacitor circuit model @xcite , impedance transmission model @xcite , effective conductivity model @xcite , just to mention a few .",
    "nonlinearity of the current density characteristics of cnts gives rises to a generation of harmonics of microwaves and direct current ( dc ) generation as well as terahertz generation @xcite .",
    "however , bloch oscillations of electrons within a cnt cause an appearance of negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) for dc fields larger than the critical electric field @xcite .",
    "this leads to electric current instabilities and formation of domains in the cnts @xcite .",
    "these current instabilities are destructive to the formation of the terahertz frequency .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider the scheme of generation of terahertz radiation than can suppress electric instabilities while preserving high - frequency gain at room temperature .",
    "theoretical realizations of superlattice oscillators ( sl ) with ac bias have been reported @xcite - @xcite , that demonstrated domainless amplification of terahertz radiation . however , there are limited reports of such effects in cnts , especially simultaneous use of dc - ac electric field .",
    "we present here , a report on a theoretical investigation of zigzag single wall carbon nanotube ( z - swcnt ) and armchair single wall carbon nanotube ( a - swcnt ) in comparison with superlattice ( sl ) under the influence of a time dependent dc - ac electric field for thz frequency generation and amplification at room temperature that indicates an order of magnitude effective suppression of the electric instability in the one dimensinal cnts in comparison with the two - dimensional sl as reported in refs @xcite - @xcite .",
    "following the approach of refs .",

    "the electric field @xmath50 is applied along cns axis . in this problem",
    "the relaxation term @xmath49 is assumed to be constant .",
    "the relaxation term of eqn . describes the effects of the dominant type of scattering ( e.g. electron - phonon and electron - twistons ) . for the electron scattering by twistons ( thermally activated twist deformations of the tube lattice ) , @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath8 ( armchair dual index ( @xmath51 ) ) @xcite and the @xmath52 characteristics shows that scattering by twistons increases and decreases in the negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) region ; the smaller @xmath8 is , the stronger this effect .",
    "quantitative changes of the @xmath52 curves turn out to be insignificant in comparison with the case of @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the distribution functions for zigzag cnt could be expanded in fourier series @xcite as , @xmath54 @xmath55 here , the energy unit @xmath56 has been used , @xmath57 is the dirac delta function , @xmath58 is summation over the stark component , @xmath59 is the coefficient of the fourier series and @xmath60 is the factor by which the fourier transform of the non - equilibrium distribution function differs from its equilibrium distribution counterpart .",

    "@xmath59 is expressed as .",
    "@xmath61 substituting eqns . and into eqn . ,",
    "and solving with eqn .",
    "we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the bessel function of the @xmath65 order and @xmath66 . to obtain the current density ,",
    "we expand @xmath67 in fourier series with coefficients @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and expressing the velocity as @xmath71 the surface current density is then defined as @xmath72 or @xmath73 the integration is taken over the first brillouin zone . substituting eqs . , and into we determined the current density for the zigzag cnt after averaging over a period of time as @xmath74 when the electric field amplitudes are small @xmath75 , we can use the bessel function approximation @xmath76 and @xmath77 . hence from eqn .",

    "these are similar to the equations obtained in ref @xcite for @xmath82 . on the other hand we can re - write eqn . in the form of ref @xcite as ;",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 and for @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the photon replicas .",
    "expression is the superposition of the dc current density and its various photon replicas .",
    "we obtained the dc differential conductivity as ; @xmath87 where @xmath66 , @xmath88 for zigzag cnt and @xmath89 , @xmath90 for armchair cnt .",
    "this is exactly what is obtained by ref @xcite except that the 1d cnts have the stark component ( summation over r ) which is absent in ref @xcite and consequently making the 1d cnts more nonlinear than the 2d sl",
    "we present the results of a semiclassical theory of electron transport in a cnts simultaneously exposed to both constant ( dc ) and ac electric fields .",
    "the boltzmann s equation is solved in the frame work of momentum - independent relaxation time . an analytical expression for the current density",
    "is obtained for the situation @xmath75 .",
    "the nonlinearity is analyzed basically on the dependence of the current density on the frequency and the d.c electric field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : drsule1 ] , we show the plot of the real part of the normalized current density ( @xmath91 ) as a function of dimensionless frequency ( @xmath92 ) for a superlattice ( thick solid curve ) , a a - swcnt and a z - swcnt , respectively . in all three systems",
    ", we observed that the real part of the differential conductivity is initially negative at zero frequency and becomes more negative with increasing frequency , until it researches a resonance minimum at a frequency just below the bloch frequency ( @xmath93 ) and then turning positive ( resonance enhancement ) just below the bloch frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : drsule1 ] ) .",
    "this resonance enhancement is indicative for terahertz gain at frequency without the formation of current instabilities induced by negative dc conductivity .",
    "it is worth to note that the effect is about twice and trice stronger in the a - swcnt and z - swcnt , respectively , in comparison to the sl , indicating stronger effective suppression of the current instability in cnts .    the dependence of @xmath94 on @xmath20 eqn . as well as @xmath95 eqn .",
    "on @xmath20 arising under the action of strong ac field . if ac field is applied along the cnts axis in addition to the dc field , , new transport channels are opened at large ac field which are seen as distinctive peaks in the current density and the conductivity characteristics as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : drsule2 ] and [ fig : drsule3 ] , respectively .",
    "we note a very steep positive slope in the neighborhood of the maximum electric field , which indicates that the differential conductivity is positive ( pdc ) in this region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : drsule2 ] ) .",
    "the pdc is considered one of the conditions for electric stability in the nonlinear system .",
    "the negative ac conductivity at the drive frequency appears when electric is weak .",
    "we observed that in the nonlinear regime with high - enough frequency , the dc differential conductivity is positive , while the large - signal high frequency differential conductivity remains negative ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : drsule3 ] ) , which can be used for thz gain .",
    "the magnitude of the current density as well as dc differential conductivity is an order of magnitude higher a - swcnt and z - swcnt in comparison to that of sl .",
    "the strong effects in cnts are due to the higher density of free electrons in the cnts .",
    "the mechanism of the nonlinearity in cnts is due to the presence of the high stark components ( summation with respect to @xmath58 , eqns .",
    "( [ eq : sixteen ] - [ eq : eighteen ] ) @xcite which are absent in superlattice @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have used the semi - classical boltzmann transport equation to obtain the electric current density and the dc conductivity in a achiral cnt under the influence of simultaneous dc , ac electric field applied parallel to the tube axis .",
    "our analysis on the current density versus electric field characteristics demonstrate negative high frequency differential conductivity resonance enhancement , photon assisted peaks , suppression of current instability induced by negative dc conductivity and therefore the possibility of terahertz gain at room temperature without electric instabilities .    9 g.ya .",
