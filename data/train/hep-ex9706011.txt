    "the top quark is of fundamental importance in understanding the standard model of particle interactions .",
    "the measurement of the top quark mass and the mass of the @xmath4 boson can be used together to constrain the mass of the higgs particle , an as yet unobserved particle which is responsible for the generation of masses in the standard model .",
    "failure to obtain higgs mass constraints within reasonable limits can become the first indication of the incompleteness of the standard model .",
    "this paper reports on the latest measurements of the top quark mass from the tevatron experiments , cdf and d . combining the measurements of the mass from the lepton + jets channel from the two experiments",
    "yields a value for the top quark mass which has the least error obtained to date . in what follows",
    ", we will report on mass measurements in three different decay modes of the system .",
    "the standard model top quark decays into a @xmath5 quark and a @xmath4 .",
    "the final states of the   system are distinguished by the decay modes of the two @xmath4 s in the event .",
    "these are ,    * the dilepton channel , where both the @xmath4 s decay into a lepton and a neutrino . due to the presence of the two neutrinos , this channel is underconstrained .",
    "both cdf and d  have differing methods to extract the mass from this channel .",
    "* the all jets channel , where both the @xmath4 s decay into pairs .",
    "there are no neutrinos in this channel that can lead to missing transverse energy .",
    "cdf has reported a measurement in this channel . *",
    "the lepton + jets channel , where one @xmath4 decays into a lepton and neutrino and the other decays into . both cdf and d  have similar methods to extract the mass information .",
    "the d  analysis , using multivariate techniques , is new and is being reported for the first time at this conference .",
    "we will describe this channel from both experiments more completely than the others , since the global average mass is being determined using this channel only and also because the other results have been reported at previous conferences .    in all that follows",
    ", jet energies have been corrected down to the parton level , using monte carlo models of fragmentation . in making event selection cuts ,",
    "however , cdf uses uncorrected jet energies whereas d  uses corrected energies .",
    "in the absence of initial or final state gluon radiation , the 6 decay particles of the   system can be described by 18 variables .",
    "each particle is described by a three momentum , its energy being determined given its rest mass .",
    "the hadronic system that recoils against the   system is described by its @xmath6 , which adds another two variables .",
    "there are five constraints on the model to fit the event , namely that the effective mass of the two @xmath4 decay particles has to equal the @xmath4 mass , that the effective masses of the top and anti - top decay products have to be equal to each other and that the transverse momentum components of the recoiling hadronic system have to equal the transverse momentum components of the   system .",
    "this implies that the theoretical fitting model has 15 free parameters . in the all jets case , all the final state particles and the transverse momentum components of the recoiling system",
    "are observed , yielding 20 measurements . the system is thus overconstrained by 5 , yielding a 5c fit . in the lepton",
    "+ jets case , the neutrino three momentum is unknown , yielding 17 measured variables leading to a 2c fit . in the dilepton channel",
    ", two neutrinos are missing , yielding 14 measured variables .",
    "this leads to an underconstrained situation ( @xmath7c fit ) .",
    "if the top quark mass is specified , one gets a 0c case , and the neutrino solutions can be determined for each given top quark mass , leading to a likelihood distribution for the top quark mass for each event . since in general , one does not know if a particular jet is the result of a @xmath5 quark decay , there exist several permutations of final state particles that must be fitted for the hypothesis in question .",
    "in the all jets case , when both the @xmath5 quarks are tagged , there exist 6 ways of combining the remaining 4 jets into two @xmath4 decay groups . with only one @xmath5 quark tagged",
    ", there exist 10 ways of combining the remaining 5 jets into the two jets associated with the tagged @xmath5 jet and another three permutations among the remaining three jets to assign the untagged @xmath5 jet , yielding 30 combinations in all . for the lepton + jets channel , there are 12 combinations in the untagged case and 6 combinations in the tagged case . for the dilepton channel ,",
    "there are two combinations for the tagged and untagged case .",
    "the fitting procedure is applied to each combination independently and only combinations that meet a goodness of fit @xmath8 criterion are kept in the constrained case . in the unconstrained case",
    ", the likelihood distributions from the combinations are added up and renormalized to obtain the likelihood distribution for the event .",
    "when extra jets are present , the number of combinations increases rapidly .",
    "for this reason , unless otherwise stated , only the highest @xmath9 jets are used in the fit , the number of jets being the minimum required to fulfill the kinematic hypothesis .",
    "the cdf collaboration @xcite employs two different techniques in extracting the mass from the dilepton channels . using event selection cuts described in the previous talk @xcite , and a cut @xmath10 170 gev , where @xmath11 is the scalar sum of the @xmath9 of the various objects , cdf obtains 1 candidate in the @xmath12 channel , 1 in the @xmath13 channel and 6 in the @xmath14 channels .",
    "the first method compares @xmath9 of the found jets with monte carlo from different masses .",
    "this relies on the fact the average @xmath9 of the two @xmath5 quark jets from top quark decay is directly related to the top quark mass .",
    "the heavier the top quark , the more energetic are the @xmath5 quarks on average .",
    "this method yields a mass of 159 @xmath1517(sys ) gev / c@xmath2 .",
    "the second method uses the approximate expression @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lepton @xmath5 quark effective mass and @xmath18 is the angle between the lepton and the @xmath5 quark . the quantity @xmath19 is obtained from monte carlo and a correspondence function between monte carlo and data is used to calibrate the result yielding a mass of @xmath20 gev / c@xmath2 .",
    "the d  collaboration uses a variant of the method proposed by dalitz , goldstein @xcite and kondo @xcite where for each top mass hypothesis , one tries to obtain solutions for the neutrinos .",
    "this results in 0,2 or 4 solutions .",
    "the event four vectors are smeared many times in order to estimate the probability of neighbouring events fluctuating to give the observed event .",
    "if one introduces additional information on the qcd production of the system , one can weight each solution by a weight proportional to the product of the structure functions and a decay probability@xcite .",
    "the d  analysis yields a mass @xcite of @xmath21 gev / c@xmath2 .",
    "only the cdf collaboration has reported a mass measurement in this channel .",
    "cdf performs a three constraint fit in this channel , ( instead of a possible five constraint fit ) by not demanding @xmath6 balance between the recoiling system and the   system . by demanding @xmath22 per event and the jet @xmath23 gev",
    ", cdf observes 142 events with a @xmath5 quark tag in the silicon vertex detector , with a calculated background of 113 .",

    ".    0.5 cm",
    "the cdf collaboration uses three different techniques to determine the mass from the lepton + jets channels . the first is largely unchanged from the time of the top quark discovery @xcite .",
    "they require 3 jets with @xmath2515 gev and pseudo - rapidity @xmath26 and a fourth jet with @xmath258 gev and @xmath27 .",
    "they require at least one jet to be @xmath5-tagged with the silicon vertex detector or using a secondary lepton .",
    "thirty four events pass the selection criteria .",
    "all events are treated as a single sample .",
    "the estimated non - top background in this sample is 6.4@xmath28 events .",

    "the second method is called the l@xmath30 method , where they use in addition the jet charge and jet tagging probability to enhance the @xmath8 discriminant .",
    "the silicon vertex detector tagging probability is used to assign a jet to be of primary ( @xmath5 quark ) or secondary ( w decay ) origin .",
    "this information is used to weight each combination .",
    "an algorithm is used to estimate the leading quark charge to discriminate between @xmath5 and @xmath31 jets .",
