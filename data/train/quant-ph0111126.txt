    "young s double slit experiment along with it s modern variants has been central to our understanding of many important aspects of quantum mechanics @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the interferences arise because the photon can reach the screen either by passing through one or the other slit and it is the inability to distinguish between the two paths that produces the interference fringes .",
    "if , however , one could devise a method so as to detect the path the photon took then the interference would be wiped out @xcite .",
    "young s double slit experiment and other experiments have also been performed with matter waves @xcite where one has clearly understood the disappearance or the fuzziness in the interference pattern if one tries to identify the atomic path , e.g. by detecting the scattered light or probing the internal levels of the diffracted particles @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals involving cavities to efface the interference by getting _",
    "welcher weg _ information and to recover the interference by using quantum eraser @xcite . a recent experiment by bertet et al .",
    "@xcite follows a scheme very close to the one proposed by scully and drhl .",
    "@xcite . all these experiments provide us with a clear understanding of the close relationship between complementarity , _ welcher weg _ information and the presence or absence of an interference pattern .",
    "recently , eichmann et al . carried out a very interesting experiment where the two slits were replaced by two microscopic objects , namely two hg@xmath0 ions well localised in a linear paul trap @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the two ions were driven coherently by a linear polarized laser field close to the @xmath1 transition in @xmath2hg@xmath0 . to measure the intensity profile of the scattered fluorescence light in the far field they used a polarization selective detection . in this case",
    "well defined interference fringes were reported for @xmath3-polarised scattered radiation whereas no interference was found for @xmath4-polarised emitted light .",
    "a detailed theoretical analysis of these findings was given by itano et al .",
    "the results are again interpreted in terms of _ welcher weg _ information : for @xmath3-polarised detection the final states of the two ions are the same as the initial states whereas for @xmath4-polarised detection they are different and thus one does not ( does ) have the which path information @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the question whether it is possible to see interference fringes even for @xmath4-polarised emitted light if one changed the set up and decided to measure other physical quantities . we know from previous work @xcite that the radiation emitted by a coherently driven system can have highly nonclassical characteristics . therefore , in order to understand all the features of the scattered radiation it becomes almost mendatory to study higher order correlations , in particular intensity - intensity correlations of the field emitted by the two atom system @xcite . in what follows",
    "we thus turn our attention to the intensity - intensity second order correlation function .",
    "we demonstrate that for two 4-level atoms quantum interferences in the second order correlations of the emitted fluorescence light can be observed for the case of joint detection with two detectors ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we derive the remarkable result that the depth of modulation in such coincidences can be 100 % for both @xmath4 and @xmath3-polarised fluorescence light , independent of the strength of the driving field .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the visibility of the interference pattern of the far field _",
    "profile which can be observed in case of @xmath3-polarised emitted radiation : this strongly depends on the power of the laser driving the atoms @xcite . we can interpret our new outcomes on interferences in the intensity - intensity correlations as resulting from interferences in the two photon decay channels of the system and show that such interferences are absent in case of a single photon decay .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ qintensity ] we present a general approach to the problem of interferences in the intensity of emitted fluorescence light and derive basic conditions for the existence of an interference pattern . here",
    "a connection with the traditional _ welcher weg _ - argument is made . in section [ g2 ]",
    "we derive a very general result for the second order intensity - intensity correlation for a two atom system and find conditions for which such a correlation will exhibit interferences . in section [ young ] we apply the results of section [ g2 ] to the experiment of eichman et al . ; here we make new predictions .",
    "we use a master equation framework so that we can deal with arbitrarily strong coherent driving fields .",
    "the main result of the paper is that in order to observe quantum interferences in the fluorescence light it is not necessarily adequate to study the intensity of the emitted radiation as very interesting interference information can be revealed by studying quantum statistics and in particular the intensity - intensity correlations of the scattered light field .",
    "consider a system of identical atoms located at positions @xmath5 .",
    "each atom can in principle involve several emission lines , i.e. emissions at several frequencies .",
    "the atom can also produce emission at the same frequency but each emission can come from a different transition . for the purpose of this paper we assume emission at a single frequency coming say from several different transitions @xmath6 .",
    "each atom can either be continuously driven or the initial state might be prepared by a pulsed excitation .    * intensity distribution *    let @xmath7 be the dipole matrix element for the transition @xmath6 .",
    "in quantum theory it is known how to relate the statistical properties of the spontaneously emitted radiation to the atomic properties @xcite .",
    "in fact , the positive frequency part of the electric field operator in the far field zone can be written in terms of the atomic operators @xmath8 as    @xmath9    @xmath10    where in eq .",
    "( [ efield ] ) we sum over all transitions corresponding to the possible spontaneous decay channels .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the polarization of a detected signal assuming that the detection is polarization selective .",
    "the detected signal will then involve the component    @xmath12    and hence , except in the forward direction , the intensity of the signal , in arbitrary units , will be    @xmath13    let us rewrite eq.([intensity ] ) as    @xmath14    as can be seen from ( [ intensity1 ] ) , the intra - atomic interference terms show up in the intensity provided that the correlations @xmath15 are nonzero",
    ".    of special concern for us is here the case of _ uncorrelated _ atoms . in this case",
    "the two atom expectation value factorizes in terms of single atom quantities    @xmath16    from ( [ intensity1 ] ) and ( [ correl2 ] ) we can see that the radiation from two uncorrelated atoms can interfere only if the atoms have nonzero coherences , i.e. nonzero dipole moments    @xmath17    this situation is similar to the one occuring in classical electrodynamics , e.g. in the case of interference in the radiation from coherently driven classical antennas . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are no atomic coherences the interferences can be exhibited only if the atoms are _ correlated _ , as one would expect from ( [ intensity1 ] ) .    * nonzero dipole moment and the lack of _ welcher weg _",
    "information *    in quantum theory the existence of interference can be interpreted in terms of _ welcher weg _",
    "information @xcite .",
    "thus one would like to understand the interference resulting from nonzero dipole moment as something arising from our lack of information regarding the source of the detected photon .",
    "consider for this purpose for example an initial state of a system of two identical two - level atoms as @xmath18 .",
    "the atoms decay independently of each other .",
    "there are two paths of decay , i.e. @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "for these two paths the final state of the two atom system is different and therefore interference does not occur .",
    "let us next consider as initial state a state which is a superposition of ground and excited levels @xmath21 .",
    "note that this is a state for which the dipole moment is nonzero .",
    "let the initial state of the two atom system be @xmath22 .",
    "after decay of a photon we get depending on which path of decay is considered ,    @xmath23    or @xmath24    the two paths lead to final states which have a common component @xmath25 occuring with amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "thus an interference appears which is proportional to @xmath27 or to the modulus square of the dipole moment @xmath28 . in this manner",
    "we have established a connection between arguments based on _ welcher weg _ information and the existence of a dipole moment .",
    "from our discussion in section [ qintensity ] it is clear that the case of _ uncorrelated _ atoms with zero dipole moment is especially challenging since in this case no quantum interferences are observable in the intensity profile of the far field , i.e. @xmath29 shows no modulation . in this section",
    "we demonstrate on very general grounds that nevertheless quantum interferences with high modulation depth may exist , in particular if the intensity - intensity correlations in the field produced by the uncorrelated atoms are considered .    in order to motivate our discussion consider again the simple case of two identical 2-level atoms with initial state @xmath18 .",
    "consider the following two - photon emission channels ( see fig .",
    "1 )    @xmath30    or @xmath31",
    "@xmath32    clearly , the different paths for two photon decay can interfere as the initial and final states of the paths are identical .",
    "this can be demonstrated explicitly by using higher order fermi - golden rule .",
    "the phase factors like @xmath33 originating from the intermediate states give rise to the interference terms .",
    "we now consider the general situation for a two atom system using the result ( [ efieldproj ] ) .",
    "let us write it in the form    @xmath34    where for example @xmath35 is the contribution to the scattered field by atom @xmath36 at the point @xmath37 , with polarization @xmath38 .",
    "in what follows we examine the second order intensity - intensity correlation for measurements with two detectors located at @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "we furthermore suppose a polarization selective detection , e.g. we assume that the detector at @xmath40 selects polarization @xmath41 .",
    "let us consider the intensity - intensity correlation function defined by    @xmath42    which on using ( [ efieldproj1 ] ) reduces to    @xmath43    note that the vacuum terms do not contribute to normally ordered correlations .",
    "since the single atom operators satisfy the property    @xmath44    the terms like @xmath45 are identically zero .",
    "hence ( [ g2simple ] ) reduces further to    @xmath46    we next make use of the _ uncorrelated _ nature of the atoms @xmath36 and @xmath47 to simplify ( [ g2simplea ] ) in the following manner    @xmath48    clearly , the existence of interference terms in @xmath49 depends on the nonvanishing of the _ amplitude correlation _",
    "function    @xmath50    note that @xmath51 , which is a measure of spatial coherence , is not necessarily zero even if @xmath52 is zero .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ g2simpleb ] ) also in the form    @xmath53    where    @xmath54    note that ( [ g2ssimple ] ) has resemblence to the well known result for thermal light @xcite .",
    "however , it should be borne in mind that for radiation produced by coherently driven single atoms @xmath55 can also be negative .",
    "let us now examine more closely the structure of ( [ g1 ] ) . by using ( [ efieldproj ] )",
    ", we obtain    @xmath56    which becomes    @xmath57    if there are no excited state coherences , i.e. if @xmath58 @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath51 is nonvanishing as long as @xmath59 .",
    "for a two level transition @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) represents the excited ( ground ) state ( [ g1mod ] ) can be simplified to    @xmath63    on substituting in ( [ gamma ] ) we get    @xmath64    the interference pattern of the intensity - intensity second order correlation function @xmath49 can thus exhibit a modulation depth of 100 % irrespective of the strength of the driving field , i.e. irrespective of the degree of excitation of the atom .",
    "in particular , for the initial state @xmath18 in absence of a continuous coherent drive , one obtains well defined interferences in the second order correlation function @xmath49 whereas no interference fringes can be seen in the far field intensity distribution @xmath65 as already shown in section [ qintensity ] .",
    "in this section we will reexamine the experiment by eichmann et al . introduced above in section [ intro ] @xcite .",
    "for that purpose we make use of a master equation approach for the atomic dynamics which has the advantage to be able to deal with arbitrarily strong coherent driving fields . thus unlike in the work of itano et al .",
    "@xcite we do not use a perturbation theoretical approach . in what follows",
    "we demonstrate how quantum interferences can be recovered in the intensity - intensity correlations even in case of @xmath4-polarized light . in this case",
    "no interferences were observed in the far field intensity distribution @xcite .",
    "the corresponding level scheme is shown in fig .",
    "2 . eichmann et al . considered excitation of two 4-level atoms by @xmath3-polarized light @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous emission could occur on the transitions @xmath66 ; @xmath67 ( @xmath3-polarization ) and on the transitions @xmath68 ; @xmath69 ( @xmath4-polarization ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . assuming excitation by resonant light , the density matrix equations for this system can be written in the form    @xmath70    the remaining equations can be generated by taking complex conjugates or using @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 is the rabi frequency of the driving field @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the rates of spontaneous emission as shown in fig .",
    "2 . using ( [ mastereq ] ) , the steady state solutions are found to be    @xmath76    @xmath77    for the present system we therefore get , using ( [ efieldproj ] ) and fig .",
    "2    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the direction of the exciting radiation .",
    "note that @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 etc .",
    "thus , if the polarization vector @xmath38 is chosen such that @xmath83 , then one obtains from ( [ masterss1 ] ) and ( [ xi1 ] )    @xmath84    @xmath85    on the other hand , for @xmath86 one gets    @xmath87    @xmath88    thus the mean dipole moment or the mean radiated field in case of @xmath3-polarized emitted light is nonzero ( [ xi3 ] ) whereas it vanishes for @xmath4-polarization ( [ xi2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , as shown in section [ qintensity ] , interference fringes can be observed only for @xmath3-polarized fluorescence but not for @xmath4-polarized fluorescence light .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental and theoretical results of wineland s group @xcite . to show this more explicitly we present in what follows the general result for the far field intensity distribution of the emitted fluorescence light .",
    "* far field intensity pattern for arbitrary polarisation *    using ( [ xi1 ] ) and the solutions ( [ masterss1 ] ) and ( [ masterss2 ] ) we find    @xmath89    where the different dipole matrix elements can be shown to be given by @xcite    @xmath90    with @xmath91 .",
    "in ( [ dipole ] ) @xmath92 denotes the reduced matrix element of the dipole operator @xmath93 .",
    "on substituting ( [ dipole ] ) into ( [ g11 ] ) we obtain    @xmath94    which also turns out to be equal to @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , one can prove that    @xmath96    from which the complete expression for the far field intensity distribution can be derived ( see ( [ intensity ] ) and ( [ efieldproj1 ] ) )    @xmath97    with , according to ( [ masterss2 ] )    @xmath98    as can be seen from ( [ intense ] ) , the depth of modulation of the far field intensity distribution is determined by ( [ fract ] ) .",
    "note that this factor not only goes to zero for @xmath4-polarized fluorescence light ( via the term @xmath99 ) but also in the limit of strong driving fields @xcite .",
    "the later is also true for two coherently driven 2-level atoms @xcite .",
    "here one finds for the far field intensity distribution @xcite    @xmath100\\ ] ]    again , the depth of modulation @xmath101 vanishes in case of increasingly high laser power .",
    "* interferences in intensity - intensity correlations *    the question thus remains : is there a possibility of exhibiting quantum interferences even in case of @xmath4-polarized emitted light or in the case of strong driving fields .",
    "according to our general discussion in section [ g2 ] the answer is yes if we study intensity - intensity correlations . for this purpose",
    "we turn our attention to the analysis of the crucial object ( [ g1 ] ) . on using ( [ g1 ] ) and",
    "( [ xi1 ] ) we find :    @xmath102    in deriving ( [ g12 ] ) we used the steady state solutions ( [ masterss1 ] ) and ( [ masterss2 ] ) of the master equation for the atomic system .",
    "note that @xmath51 is proportional to the population in the upper state which is nonzero as long as the system is excited .",
    "the term in the curly bracket in ( [ g12 ] ) can be shown to be proportional to @xmath103 . using ( [ g12 ] ) in ( [ gamma ] )",
    "we thus obtain a very simple result :    @xmath104    clearly @xmath105 if one decides to pick up orthogonal polarizations at the two detectors . for identical polarization",
    "we have @xmath106 so that one obtains 100% modulation depth in the intensity - intensity correlation even if @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath4-polarized radiation . according to ( [ gamma1 ] ) the depth of modulation @xmath107 is simply determined by the two plarization vectors    @xmath108    note that this factor obviously does not depend on the strength of the driving field exciting the system !    finally , in order to understand the nonclassical nature of the emitted light it is useful to introduce the normalized intensity - intensity correlation function @xmath109 via @xcite    @xmath110    which on using eqs .",
    "( [ intense ] ) and ( [ gamma1 ] ) simply becomes    @xmath111    with    @xmath112    for detection of polarization such that @xmath113 we obtain    @xmath114    so that for measurements with a single detector one gets    @xmath115    we recall from @xcite that the nonclassical nature of the radiated field is reflected by the violation of the inequality    @xmath116    clearly , with @xmath109 given by ( [ gnorm1 ] ) ( or in the special case by ( [ gnorm2 ] ) ) , a strong violation of this inequality is possible , indicating that the emitted light has highly nonclassical properties .",
    "in conclusion we have demonstrated interference phenomena in the second order correlations of the fluorescence light from ion pairs .",
    "the phenomena occur even in situations where first order interferences do not appear .",
    "an explicit manifestation of this phenomenon is presented by analyzing the system of two 4-level ions driven by a linearly polarized coherent laser field . in this case the far field intensity distribution of the scattered @xmath4-polarised light does not exhibit first order interferences .",
    "by contrast , well defined interferences are displayed in the second order correlations of the emitted fluorescence light . here",
    "we find the rather remarkable result that the intensity - intensity correlations can show a modulation depth of up to 100% for both @xmath4 and @xmath3-polarised fluorescence light , independent of the strength of the driving laser .",
    "in contrast , the modulation of the intensity profile , whenever present , depends strongly on the power of the driving laser field , vanishing in the limit of very high laser intensities . finally we discussed the nonclassical nature of the emitted fluorescence radiation .",
    "as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( 41 ) - ( 45 ) , the nonclassical nature of the scattered light can be displayed independent of the polarization of the emitted light or the strength of the driving field , i.e. independent of the appearance or disappearance of first order interference fringes .",
    "the observed interferences in the intensity - intensity correlations can also be explained in terms of the entanglement induced by the detection of the first photon .",
    "needless to say that our results can be generalised to include more atoms or ions and that more complex atomic transitions can be considered .",
    "the former should be especially relevant to experiments with ion chains or with atoms trapped in an optical lattice .",
