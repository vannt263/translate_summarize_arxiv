    "based on the standard big bang nucleosynthesis , the first generation of stars should form from materials deficient in heavy elements . in the present - day galaxies , heavy elements or dust grains provide the most efficient cooling mechanism , while the cooling process in primordial gas is likely to be governed by hydrogen molecules .",
    "many authors hitherto have considered the formation processes of primordial stars from metal deficient gas ( e.g. , matsuda , sato , & takeda 1969 ; yoneyama 1972 ; hutchins 1976 ; silk 1977a , 1977b ; yoshii & sabano 1979 ; carlberg 1981 ; struck - marcell 1982a , 1982b ; lepp & shull 1983 , 1984 ; silk 1983 ; palla , salpeter , & stahler 1983 ; yoshii & saio 1986 ; shapiro & kang 1987 ; de arajo & opher 1989 ; uehara et al .",
    "1996 ; haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ; omukai et al .",
    "such first - generation stars , say population iii , could play an important role in the early evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , tegmark , silk , & blanchard 1994 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) or the formation of massive black holes ( umemura et al . 1993 ) .",
    "also , they may be responsible for the chemical pollution of intergalactic medium which is recently inferred from metallic absorption in ly@xmath15 forest seen in quasar light ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) .",
    "it is thus important to study the thermal and dynamical evolution of the primordial gas clouds from which the first - generation stars would form .",
    "if the hydrogen gas were to remain purely atomic , the primordial gas would be cooled down to 10@xmath16 k due to the lyman @xmath15 lines .",
    "it is , however , difficult for the gas temperature to become lower , because hydrogen atoms are poor radiator in the lower temperature gas .",
    "therefore , the jeans mass of such a cloud , which is often referred to the characteristic mass in the star formation theory , becomes much greater than a typical stellar mass . in practice ,",
    "hydrogen molecules provide key cooling mechanisms .",
    "in contrast to the molecule formation on dust grains in metal - rich interstellar gas , the formation of primordial hydrogen molecules can proceed through the gas phase reaction ( saslaw & zipoy 1967 ; peebles & dicke 1968 ) , @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 at high density of @xmath21@xmath1 , the molecules can also form through the three - body reactions ( palla et al . 1983 ) ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 even if a relatively small fraction ( @xmath24 ) of the molecules form , they make a significant contribution to cooling through the rotational and vibrational transitions , so that the temperature of primordial gas can be reduced to a lower temperature than @xmath25k ( e.g. , matsuda et al .",
    "1969 ; yoneyama 1972 ; hutchins 1976 ; palla , et al . 1983 ) .",
    "resultantly , the jeans mass could decrease to stellar mass .",
    "however , although a lot of elaborate analyses have been made so far , the masses of population iii stars have not been well converged .",
    "carlberg ( 1981 ) and palla et al .",
    "( 1983 ) have shown the jeans mass can go down to a level of @xmath26 .",
    "yoshii & saio ( 1986 ) derive the initial mass function ( imf ) based upon the opacity - limited fragmentation theory ( silk 1977a , 1977b ) and find the peak of the imf around @xmath27 .",
    "uehara et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that the minimum masses of the first - generation stars are basically determined by the _ chandrasekhar _ mass ,",
    "say @xmath28 ( see also rees 1976 ) . in this paper , we reanalyze the formation of population iii stars by computing the collapse of filamentary clouds coupled with h@xmath3 formation .    in the bottom - up scenarios like a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , it is expected that the overdense regions with the masses of @xmath29 would first collapse at the redshift range of @xmath30 and the first generation of stars would form there .",
    "the importance of the h@xmath3 cooling in the collapse of such primordial clouds has been stressed by several authors ( e.g. , de arajo & opher 1989 ; haiman et al .",
    "1996 ; susa et al . 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "it has been found in these studies that the mass fraction of h@xmath3 can reach @xmath31 up to @xmath32 and the temperature of the cloud can be reduced to @xmath33 k. however , most of the studies are restricted to highly simplified models such as homogeneous pressure - less and/or spherical collapses . in practice",
    ", the cloud contraction proceeds inhomogeneously .",
    "since the cloud is more or less nonspherical , the deviation from spherical symmetry grows in time due to its self - gravity until a shocked pancake forms ( e.g. , umemura 1993 ) .",
    "recently , several authors have studied the collapse of pregalactic clouds with multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , anninos & norman 1996 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately they still do not have enough spatial resolution as well as mass resolution to explore the star formation .",
    "the pancake could be gravitationally unstable against fragmentation ( e.g. , umemura 1993 ; anninos & norman 1996 ) .",
    "it tends to fragment into thin filamentary clouds rather than spherical ones ( miyama , narita , & hayashi 1987a , 1987b ; uehara et al .",
    "the filamentary cloud can also fragment into smaller and denser cores ( e.g. , larson 1985 ) , in which consequently stars can form . in this paper",
    "we thus investigate the thermal and dynamical evolution of the filamentary primordial gas clouds . with using one - dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamical scheme",
    ", we pursue the evolution in the range of more than eighth order of magnitude in density contrast to properly estimate the mass scale of the first - generation stars .    in  [ sec :",
    "model construction ] , we describe our model clouds and the computational methods .",

    "it indicates that the spindle contracts in a self - similar manner . actually , we have found a similarity solution , which is presented in the appendix , and it has turned out that the newly found similarity solution well reproduces the numerical results .",
    "( see the appendix for the further detail ) at the shock front , the temperature rises up to @xmath196 k. the contraction time in the spindle is much shorter than that in the envelope .",
    "thus the spindle collapses almost independently of the envelope .",
    "when the cloud becomes optically thick against the h@xmath3 lines at the center , the pressure force overwhelms the gravity , so that the second shock forms around @xmath197 pc .",
    "after this stage the contraction time of the spindle becomes much longer than @xmath189 and the collapse promptly decelerates .",
    "figure [ fig : line mass ] shows the evolution of the line mass of the spindle as a function of the central density .",
    "we define the line mass as the density integrated over @xmath198 up to the radius at which the density goes down to one tenth of the central density , @xmath199 it is worth noting that during the contraction , the line mass of the spindle keeps a nearly constant value , which is @xmath200 pc@xmath7 .",
    "this value is close to the line mass of an isothermal filamentary cloud in equilibrium for the temperature of 800 k , i.e. , @xmath201 .",
    "it implies that the gravitational force nearly balances with the pressure force in the spindle .    we have found that the evolution is almost independent of the initial parameters , @xmath149 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , for the models with @xmath202 k.      in this subsection",

    "the early evolution is similar ; the clouds collapse adiabatically , @xmath208 , because the h@xmath3 cooling is not effective for @xmath209 k. however the later evolution is quite different . for the model with a small @xmath136",
    ", the collapse almost ceases until the central density reaches @xmath210 @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the contraction time , which is nearly equal to the cooling time , is a hundred times as long as the free - fall time .",

    "the evolution is similar to that of the model with @xmath211 k. when the cloud temperature exceeds 500 k , the collapse proceeds nearly isothermally due to the h@xmath3 line cooling . in all the models with @xmath212 k , it has turned out that the evolution proceeds in a similar way dependent upon the value of @xmath136 .",
    "as shown in the previous section , if @xmath213 k or @xmath214 , the filaments collapse quasi - statically , whereas the filaments would not continue to contract if @xmath215 k and @xmath216 . in the latter case , the filament would be weakly unstable because the length of the realistic filament is shorter than the wavelength of the most unstable mode .",
    "consequently , the filament is likely to contract along the axis without fragmentation .",
    "also , as mentioned in ",
    "[ subsec : formation ] , the temperature of the initial filaments is estimated to be @xmath217 k in a cdm model . hence , such low temperature clouds are hardly expected in a cdm scenario .",
    "thus , here we focus on the former case , i.e. , a collapsing filament , and consider the hierarchical fragmentation .",
    "the density of a collapsing filament is enhanced by more than eighth order of magnitude , with the constant temperature of @xmath218 k , until the cloud becomes opaque .",
    "thus , the filament could fragment into denser lumps . to diagnose the fragmentation process",
    ", we apply a linear theory to the numerical results and thereby estimate the length and mass scales of fragments .    according to the linear theory of an isothermal hydrostatic filament ,",
    "the perturbation grows most rapidly when its wavelength is about four times longer than the effective cloud diameter .",
    "the wavelength and growth rate of the most unstable perturbation depend on the density and temperature of the cloud .",
    "therefore , they change according as the collapse proceeds . in our model of  [ subsec:500k ] , the contraction timescale ( @xmath219 ) is longer by a factor of more than five than the free - fall time at the center ( @xmath189 ) after the central density reaches @xmath220 @xmath1 .",
    "according to inutsuka & miyama ( 1992 ) , when @xmath221 , the dispersion relation for the collapsing filament is approximated by that of the hydrostatic filament whose scale height is the same as the temporal one of the collapsing cloud , and thus the growth of the density perturbation is approximated by @xmath222 during its linear growth phase , where @xmath223 and @xmath224 denote the wavenumber and the frequency of the perturbation , respectively .",
    "we thus apply the above equation to our model of  [ subsec:500k ] . for the growth rate ( @xmath225 )",

    "we take @xmath227 in the form of the power law @xmath228 .",
    "when the amplitude of the unstable density perturbation becomes greater than unity ( @xmath229 ) , the evolution of the perturbation becomes nonlinear and the cloud will breaks into pieces . it is expected that the evolution of the perturbation depends on the index @xmath230 and the amplitude @xmath231 .",
    "assuming @xmath232 or @xmath233 , we have calculated the time evolution of the density contrast in the filamentary cloud .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : growth ] .",
    "the solid curves show the density contrast at ( 1 ) @xmath234 yr ( @xmath235 @xmath1 ) , ( 2 ) @xmath236 yr ( 10@xmath237 @xmath1 ) , ( 3 ) @xmath238 yr ( 10@xmath239 @xmath1 ) , ( 4 ) @xmath240 yr ( 10@xmath241 @xmath1 ) , and ( 5 ) @xmath242 yr ( @xmath243 @xmath1 ) , respectively . here",
    ", we have taken @xmath244 . when @xmath245 @xmath1 , the wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation is about a hundred times as long as the effective cloud diameter , because of the cumulated growth rate .",
    "hence , the cloud is likely to tear into long filaments before the central density reaches @xmath246 @xmath1 , if the fluctuations have enough initial amplitudes to enter nonlinear stages .",
    "the long filaments shrink further to form thinner filaments . as the shrink proceeds , the wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation shortens .",
    "thus , the filaments may again tear into shorter and denser filaments . consequently",
    ", hierarchical filamentary structures would form , if the initial amplitudes are larger than 0.001 as expected in a cdm cosmology .",
    "when the central density exceeds @xmath246 @xmath1 , the cloud becomes opaque against the h@xmath3 lines and the collapse quickly decelerates .",
    "hence the hierarchical fragmentation would be terminated .",
    "then the wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation becomes @xmath247 , which is comparable to that expected from the linear theory of an isothermal filament in equilibrium , as shown by the growth rate in the ending stage in figure 5 .",
    "then , the cloud is most unstable against the perturbation whose wavelength is about four times as large as the effective cloud diameter .",
    "this wavelength is nearly independent of the power index @xmath230 as shown in figure [ fig : growth ] . as a result ,",
    "the filament is likely to finally fragment into dense cores , the typical mass of which is @xmath248 .",
    "this is the lowest mass of fragments , which provides the minimum core mass for the first - generation stars .",
    "the mass possibly increases by accreting the ambient gas .",
    "if all the ambient gas within one wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation accretes onto the core , then the core mass increases to @xmath249 . thus , the mass of the first stars is expected to be in the range of @xmath250 .",
    "it should be noted that the lower mass as well as the upper mass is not sensitive to the amplitude of the power - law spectrum , because the lower mass is basically determined by the micro process of the h@xmath3 cooling and the upper mass depends only upon the initial temperature .",
    "in a wide range of the parameter space , we have numerically explored the thermal and dynamical evolution of filamentary primordial gas clouds with including nonequilibrium process for the h@xmath3 formation .",
    "we have found that for the models with @xmath251 k or @xmath252 , the collapse proceeds nearly isothermally due to the h@xmath3 line cooling , staying the temperature at @xmath253 k. during the contraction , the cloud structure is divided into two parts , i.e. , a spindle and an envelope .",
    "the line mass of the spindle keeps a nearly constant value of @xmath254 pc@xmath7 during the contraction from @xmath255 @xmath1 to @xmath256 @xmath1 .",
    "the outer part in the spindle exhibits a power - law density distribution as @xmath195 .",
    "this behavior is well reproduced by a newly found self similar solution . when the central density reaches @xmath257 @xmath1 , the cloud becomes opaque against the h@xmath3 line cooling and reaches a quasi - static equilibrium state with keeping the line mass . on the other hand , for the models with @xmath258 k and @xmath216 , the cloud contraction is much slower because the h@xmath3 cooling is not effective .",
    "the contraction immediately ceases . in a cdm scenario ,",
    "the former case ( collapsing filaments ) would be more probable .    applying a linear theory for the gravitational instability of collapsing filaments",
    ", we find that the spindle is unstable against fragmentation during the quasi - static contraction .",
    "the wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation ( @xmath10 ) lessens as the collapse proceeds .",
    "thus successive fragmentation could occur .",
    "when the central density exceeds @xmath259 @xmath1 , the successive fragmentation may be suppressed since the cloud becomes opaque against the h@xmath3 lines and the collapse promptly decelerates .",
    "resultingly , the minimum value of @xmath10 is estimated to be @xmath12 pc .",
    "the typical mass of the first stars is then expected to be @xmath13 , which may grow up to @xmath260 by accreting the diffuse envelope .",
    "the present results may be relevant to the early evolution of primordial galaxies and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic space .",
    "we are grateful to drs .",
    "t. nakamoto , and h. susa for stimulating discussion .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for valuable comments which improved the paper .",
    "this work was carried out at the center for computational physics of university of tsukuba .",
    "this work was supported in part by the grants - in aid of the ministry of education , science , and culture ( 09874055 , 09740171 , 10147205 ) .",
    "as mentioned in  3 , the spindle seems to collapse self - similarly during the nearly isothermal contraction phase from @xmath261 @xmath1 to 10@xmath241 @xmath1 ; e.g. , the density distribution of the spindle is characterized by the power - law distribution of @xmath195 .",
    "but this behavior is different from that of the similarity solution ( @xmath262 ) of an isothermal filamentary cloud that is known so far ( miyama et al .",
    "1987a ; see also eqs . [",
    "[ eq : iso1 ] ] and [ [ eq : iso2 ] ] ) . in this appendix",
    "we seek another type of similarity solutions in more generic equations of state .",
    "we consider an infinitely long cylindrical cloud in which the density is uniform along the axis .",
    "we assume the gas to be polytropic ; @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is constant .",

    "this is fundamentally the same as the dynamical stability condition of the sphere . ) .",
    "one of the solutions of equations ( [ ap2:eq9 ] ) through ( [ ap2:eq13 ] ) is expressed as @xmath283 and @xmath284 ^{1 \\over \\gamma - 2 }   x^{-{2 \\over 2   -   \\gamma } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] in this solution the gas is at rest and the density diverges at the origin .",
    "this solution corresponds to a singular equilibrium solution for a polytropic filamentary cloud .    a regular solution at @xmath285 has an asymptotic behavior , @xmath286 and @xmath287 thus , when the value of @xmath34 is nearly equal to unity , the density and velocity distributions follow @xmath288 and @xmath289 in the outer region of @xmath290 .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that of a sphere ( larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ) .",
    "note that this similarity solution exists only for @xmath291 .",
    "this is essentially the same as the dynamical stability condition of the polytropic cylinder .",
    "this similarity solution has different characteristics from a singular case of @xmath292 . in the similarity solution of @xmath292 , the density and velocity distributions",
    "are given as ( see miyama et al .",
    "1987a ) @xmath293 and @xmath294 which are proportional to @xmath295 and @xmath274 , respectively , in the region of @xmath296 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : simil ] the similarity solutions of @xmath297 and 0.99 are compared with that of @xmath298 .",
    "the thick and thin solid curves represent the density and velocity distributions of the similarity solutions with @xmath299 , respectively .",
    "the dashed curves are the similarity solution of @xmath300 ( miyama et al .",
    "the newly found similarity solution seems to well reproduce the numerical results during the nearly isothermal contraction phase ; the density distribution in the outer part in the spindle is nearly proportional to @xmath301 and the velocity distribution is proportional to @xmath198 near the center [ see fig . [",
    "fig : density etc ] .",
    "recently kawachi & hanawa ( 1998 ) also studied the gravitational collapse of a polytropic cylinder and confirmed that the evolution of the cylinder converges to the similarity solution . ] .",
    "it should be stressed again that whether @xmath34 is precisely unity or not transforms conclusively the self - similar manner .",
    "the present similarity solution for @xmath299 is likely to be applicable for the realistic situations .",
