    "stitching is a well studied topic in computer vision  @xcite , which mainly consists of alignment  @xcite , composition  @xcite and blending  @xcite . in consumer - level photography , it is difficult to achieve perfect alignment due to unconstrained shooting environment , so image composition becomes the most crucial step to produce artifacts - free results .",
    "seam - cutting  @xcite is a powerful composition method , which intends to find an invisible seam in the overlapping region of aligned images .",
    "mainstream algorithms usually express the problem in terms of energy minimization and minimize it via graph - cut optimization  @xcite .",
    "normally , for a given overlapping region of aligned images , different energy functions correspond to different seams , and certainly correspond to different composed results ( see fig .",
    "[ contrast_1 ] ) .",
    "conversely , in order to obtain a plausible stitching result , we desire to define a perception - consistent energy function , such that the most invisible seam possesses the minimum energy .",
    "+     +    recently , many efforts have been devoted to seam - cutting by penalizing the photometric difference using various energy functions .",
    "a euclidean - metric color difference is used in  @xcite to define the smoothness term in their energy function , and a gradient difference is taken into account in  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an energy function that allows for large motions and exposure differences , but the camera setting is required .",
    "jia and tang  @xcite associated the smoothness term with gradient smoothness and gradient similarity , to reduce structure complexity along the seam .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite combined alignment errors and a gaussian - metric color difference in their energy function , to handle misaligned areas with similar colors .",
    "however , few of existing methods consider human perception in their energy functions , which sometimes causes that a seam with minimum energy is not most invisible in the overlapping region .    seam - cutting has also been applied in image alignment .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a seam - driven image stitching framework , which finds a best homography warp from some candidates with minimal seam costs instead of minimal alignment errors .",
    "zhang and liu  @xcite combined homography and content - preserving warps to locally align images , where seam costs are used as a quality metric to predict how well a homography enables plausible stitching .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a seam - guided local alignment , which iteratively improves warping by adaptive feature weighting according to their distances to current seams .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel seam - cutting method via a perception - based energy function , which takes the nonlinearity and the nonuniformity of human perception into account .",
    "our proposed method consists of three stages ( see fig .",
    "[ comp_sc ] ) . in the first stage",
    ", we calculate a sigmoid - metric color difference of the given overlapping region as the smoothness term , to characterize the perception of color discrimination .",
    "then , we calculate an average pixel saliency of the given overlapping region as the saliency weight , to simulate that human eyes incline to pay more attention to salient objects . finally , we minimize the perception - based energy function by the graph - cut optimization , to obtain the seam and the corresponding composed result .",
    "experiments show that our method outperforms the seam - cutting method of the normal energy function , and a user study demonstrates that our composed results are more consistent with human perception .",
    "major contributions of the paper are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we proposed a novel perception - based energy function in the seam - cutting framework .",
    "our composition method can be easily implemented into other stitching pipelines .",
    "in this section , we first show more details of the normal seam - cutting framework , then a novel perception - based energy function is described , and finally we propose our seam - cutting framework .      given a pair of aligned images denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "let @xmath2 be their overlapping region and @xmath3 be a label set , where `` @xmath4 '' corresponds to @xmath0 and `` @xmath5 '' corresponds to @xmath1 , then a seam means assigning a label @xmath6 to each pixel @xmath7 .",
    "the goal of seam - cutting is to find a labeling @xmath8 ( i.e. , a map from @xmath2 to @xmath9 ) that minimizes the energy function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a neighborhood system of pixels .",
    "the _ data term _",
    "@xmath12 represents the cost of assigning a label @xmath13 to a pixel @xmath14 , and the _ smoothness term _",
    "@xmath15 represents the cost of assigning a pair of labels @xmath16 to a pair of pixels @xmath17 .",
    "the data term is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a very large penalty to avoid mislabeling , @xmath20 is the common border of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath2 ( marked in red and blue respectively in fig .",
    "[ contrast_1](a ) ) .",
    "in fact , the data term @xmath12 fixes the endpoints of the seam as the intersections of the two colored polylines .",
    "the smoothness term is defined as @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the euclidean - metric color difference ( see fig .",
    "[ comp_sc](b ) ) .",
    "finally , the normal energy function ( [ basic_energy ] ) is minimized by graph - cut optimization  @xcite to obtain the seam ( see fig .  [ comp_sc](e ) ) and the composed result ( see fig .",
    "[ comp_sc](g ) ) .",
    "obviously , the definition of the energy function plays the most important role in the seam - cutting framework .      in experiments ,",
    "the seam denoted by @xmath26 , that minimizes the normal energy function ( [ basic_energy ] ) is sometimes not most invisible in @xmath2 . in other words",
    ", there exists a seam denoted by @xmath27 , that is more invisible but has a greater energy than @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ comp_sc ] ( e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "therefore , we desire to define a perception - consistent energy function , such that the most invisible seam possesses the minimum energy .      fig .",
    "[ toy_log ] shows a toy example where @xmath26 is not most invisible .",
    "in fact , the seam @xmath26 shown in ( b ) crosses the local misalignment area ( marked in in ( a ) ) , because the euclidean - metric color difference does not give it a large enough penalty .",
    "in contrast , the seam @xmath27 shown in ( d ) avoid the local misalignment area ( marked in red in ( c ) ) , because the sigmoid - metric color difference successfully distinguish it from the alignment area .",
    "in particular , the perception of colors is nonlinear as it has a color discrimination threshold , which means human eyes can not differentiate some colors from others even if they are different .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the threshold , the perception of color discrimination can be characterized as    * if @xmath29 , color difference is invisible , * if @xmath30 , sensitivity of discrimination rises rapidly , * if @xmath31 , color difference is visible .",
    "we want to define a quality metric to measure the visibility of color difference , such that the cost of invisible terms approximates zero while the cost of visible terms approximates one .",
    "fortunately , the sigmoid function @xmath32 is a suitable quality metric for our purpose .",
    "next , we will show how to determine the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath33 .",
    "briefly , given an overlapping region @xmath2 of aligned images , the threshold @xmath28 plays the role of roughly dividing @xmath2 into an alignment area and a misalignment area by its color difference , which is similar to determine a threshold to divide a binary image into a background region and a foreground region .",
    "thus , we employ the well - known ostu s algorithm  @xcite to determine a suitable @xmath28 with the maximum between - class variance . on the other hand , @xmath33 represents how rapidly the sensitivity of color discrimination rises around @xmath28 .",
    "normally , @xmath34 will have a good practical performance , where @xmath35 is the width of bins of the histogram used in ostu s algorithm .",
    "now , the smoothness term is modified as @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the sigmoid - metric color difference .",
    "[ comp_sc](c ) shows that @xmath38 forces the misalignment area more distinguishable from the alignment area than @xmath25 , which effectively helps the seam avoid crossing the misalignment area .",
    "+      fig .",
    "[ toy_sal ] shows another toy example where @xmath26 is not most invisible .",
    "in fact , seams @xmath26 and @xmath27 shown in ( b ) and ( d ) respectively , both cross the local misalignment area . though the energy of @xmath27 is greater , it is more invisible than @xmath26 in aspect of human perception , because the location where its artifact arises is less remarkable than @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , the perception of images is nonuniform , which means that human eyes incline to pay more attention to salient objects .",
    "thus artifacts in salient regions are more remarkable than artifacts in non - salient regions . in order to benefit from these observations ,",
    "we define a saliency weight @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the average pixel saliency of @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ comp_sc](d ) ) .",
    "we normalize @xmath41 in the range of @xmath42 $ ] to avoid over - penalizing saliency weights .",
    "as stitching results are usually cropped into rectangles in consumer - level photography , we assign @xmath43 if either @xmath44 or @xmath45 is located in the common border @xmath46 of the canvas and @xmath2 ( marked in green in fig .",
    "[ comp_sc](a ) ) .    finally , the perception - based energy function is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath41 rises the penalty of @xmath48 according to @xmath40 . fig .",
    "[ comp_sc](f ) shows that the endpoints of the seam have more freedom on @xmath46 than the seam shown in fig .",
    "[ comp_sc](e ) .",
