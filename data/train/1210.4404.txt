    "the physics of suppressed electroweak ( ew ) processes by quantum loops figure as the best window for search into the new physics territory .",
    "more than three decades of the theoretical work strengthens our ability to predict their amplitudes with high precision .",
    "while electroweak and hard qcd calculations rely on the perturbative framework and the renormalization theory , the hadron matrix elements are most accurately evaluated within the lattice qcd .",
    "the extensive search for new physics at the lhc reveals a new boson particle @xcite with a mass around 125 gev .",
    "since the standard model ( sm ) does not contain massive neutrinos , lepton or baryon number violations and a candidate particle for the cold dark matter , it is very unlikely that the new particle is the sm higgs boson .",
    "however , any extension of the sm that has to fulfil above improvements , such as susy or gut extension , implicates the existence of more scalar particles .",
    "it is well known that the higgs mechanism does not solve the problem of particle masses but only breaks the gauge symmetry , i.e. the fermion masses are free parameters .",
    "the alternative explanation of the 125 gev resonance is its identification as the scalar or pseudoscalar meson , which is a mixture of the ( pseudo)scalar glueball and toponium , suggested by p. cea @xcite , thus leaving the problem of the symmetry - breaking mechanism unsolved .",
    "anyhow , the new lhc data with the total and partial decay widths of the new particle , as well as its mass , spin and parity , should resolve this puzzle .",
    "the first lhc results @xcite point to a surpuls of photons in the decay of the 125 gev resonance assumed to be a sm higgs scalar , as well as to the absence of any firm decay signal into fermions .    in this paper",
    ", we present complete one loop results for the gauge invariant functions appearing in the suppressed ew processes within the sm and the by theory @xcite , the theory without the higgs scalar but with the lorentz and gauge invariant uv cut - off .",
    "the next chapter is devoted to the explicit deccription of the calculations with details in the appendix , while the concluding section provides numerical estimates and points out the difference between the sm and the by theory .",
    "in this paper , we shall omit a detailed description of the by theory with its mathematical @xcite and phenomenological advantages in particle physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the lorentz and gauge invariant cut - off of the by theory is fixed by the wick s theorem and trace anomaly @xcite through weak coupling and the weak gauge boson mass @xmath0 where g = weak coupling , @xmath1=weak gauge boson mass .",
    "the noncontractible space can not essentially affect the strong coupling below the scale @xmath2 @xcite , hence the impact of @xmath3 on the hard qcd corrections to the electroweak processes @xcite is negligible .",
    "thus , we focus onto the dominant one loop electroweak contributions written in the form of the gauge invariant functions @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these functions appear in the meson mixings @xmath5 and meson decays @xmath6 @xcite .    the inami - lim functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are treated and compared between the sm and by theory in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
