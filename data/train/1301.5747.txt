    "with the advent of the science of complexity , numerous complexity measures have been proposed .",
    "these measures can be grouped mainly in two categories : first group follows the route of constructing the shortest computer program corresponding to a given string .",
    "the well - known kolmogorov - chaitin @xcite and logical depth @xcite measures fall into this category .",
    "the second group follows the information - theoretic approaches whose main examples can be given as effective complexity , thermodynamic depth @xcite , shiner - davison - landsberg @xcite and lpez - ruiz - mancini - calbet measures @xcite .",
    "the information - theoretic approaches are founded on the main idea of multiplying a measure of order by that of disorder . in this sense , these approaches rely heavily on the definitions of entropy as a measure of order / disorder . for example , shiner - davison - landsberg @xcite uses boltmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy of the physical system in its definition , while thermodynamic depth as a complexity measure considers the entropy of the ensemble focusing on the entire history of the system under investigation @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , none of these complexity measures have been constructed particularly to deal with the non - equilibrium stationary states resulting from the external influence of a field .",
    "such a complexity measure has been recently introduced by saparin et al . and applied to logistic map @xcite , heart rate variability @xcite and to the analysis of electroencephalograms of epilepsy patients @xcite .",
    "this new complexity measure is an information - theoretic one and is called renormalized entropy , historically originating from klimontovich s s - theorem ( the letter s here stands for the self - organization ) @xcite .",
    "the renormalized entropy is theoretically equivalent to negative relative entropy between a reference distribution and any other distribution obtained either analytically or numerically through a time - series analysis @xcite .",
    "however , it is not only associated with the relative entropy , since an additional procedure of renormalization is also introduced .",
    "the process of renormalization is used in order to compare two states by equating their mean energies so that non - equilibrium stationary states attain the same mean energy , thereby mimicking the ordinary closed system formalism . combining renormalization and the relative entropy , the renormalized entropy decreases as the control parameter increases , indicating the relative degree of order in the system as first suggested by haken @xcite in the context of self - organization .    on the other hand ,",
    "another related issue in the context of self - organization is the existence of bifurcations often observed in nonlinear dynamical systems : the systems possessing a stable fixed point become unstable as they recede away from this stable fixed point as a result of increasing nonlinear effects .",
    "these systems eventually pave their way to the new stable branches through bifurcations . for the system away from the stable fixed point",
    ", this process continues until the system sets in a new stationary state , thereby increasing its order as a signature of self - organization due to the non - linearity , dissipation and the non - equilibrium exhibited by the system ( see the detailed discussion by nicolis and prigogine in ref .",
    "physical processes such as rayleigh - benard @xcite , taylor instability @xcite experiments , bacterial @xcite and _ dictyostelium discoideum _",
    "@xcite colonies fall into the aforementioned category .",
    "these systems , being open due to exchange of energy and/or matter with its surroundings , can not be analyzed in terms of usual h - theorem , since it is valid only for isolated systems .",
    "therefore , prigogine proposed a more general form of the second law i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the entropy produced inside the system and @xmath5 is the transfer of entropy across the boundaries of the system . in this more general",
    "setting , @xmath6 whereas @xmath5 can be positive or negative depending on the flow of energy across the boundaries of the system .",
    "the overall sign of @xmath7 is determined by the interplay between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "all the aforementioned models of self - organization requires @xmath8 until the system sets in the stationary state corresponding to the most ordered pattern .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , calculation methods of the renormalized entropy is given . in section 3 , this complexity measure is applied to discrete maps possessing different universality classes i.e. to the logistic map which has periodic route to chaos and its self similar windows like period 3 and period 5 to show its robustness and to sine - circle map which has periodic and quasi - periodic route to chaos .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and compare the two different routes to chaos in terms of the renormalized entropy .",
    "let us consider a generic dynamical map @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the number of iterations and the corresponding control parameter of the dynamical map , respectively .",
    "a small change in the value of the control parameter , @xmath12 , yields two normalized distributions i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding shannon entropies read @xmath15 let us now assume that the system i.e. dynamical map under scrutiny evolves in such a manner that the state with index @xmath16 is evolved to through increasing order , namely , the system becomes self - organized as the control parameter increases .",
    "then , setting equilibrium temperature @xmath17 , the normalized boltzmann - gibbs distribution reads    @xmath18 \\label{boltzmann}\\ ] ]    with the following effective energy    @xmath19    s - theorem by klimontovich equates the effective energies of the concomitant states i.e. renormalizes the states in order to apply h - theorem of boltzmann to open systems , implying @xmath20 in the second law formulation of prigogine @xcite and @xmath21 to compensate for the mean energy difference i.e. turning open system into a closed one . denoting the renormalized state by @xmath22 , one can write    @xmath23^{\\beta_{eff}}= c\\,\\exp \\left [ \\frac{-h_{eff}(x)}{t_{eff } } \\right ] \\label{renormalization}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the normalization constant . to check whether any heat intake occurs during self - organization , to form spatially more ordered patterns , through dissipation as a result of interaction with the environment , @xmath25",
    "is calculated from the equality of mean energies    @xmath26    if heat intake is needed for the process of self - organization such as rayleigh - benard convection resulting in spatially ordered hexagonal patterns at the stationary state @xcite , then one expects , comparing the equilibrium and non - equilibrium states , @xmath27 , since @xmath17 .",
    "otherwise , we deduce that our assumption regarding the more disorderliness of the initial distribution is not correct , indicating the second distribution to be more disordered .",
    "therefore , when this is the case , one renormalizes the second distribution .",
    "the measure of relative degree of order for these compared states can then be given as the difference of entropies    @xmath28    which is called renormalized entropy @xcite .",
    "we use the spectral intensities @xmath29 and @xmath30 averaged over @xmath31 periodograms based on the multiplication of the fourier and the inverse fourier transformation of the time series of @xmath32 in the frequency domain @xmath33 , instead of the density distributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 in eqs .",
    "[ [ shannon]-[relatifentropy ] ] , respectively so that @xmath36 where the sequence @xmath37 is a sufficiently long series of values that can be obtained by iterating a mapping by sampling equidistant points and @xmath38 is the length of the samples in every periodogram @xcite , satisfying @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "such a fourier spectra eliminate the zeros in the distributions and detect different regimes of a deterministic dynamical system .",
    "to start with , let us consider a @xmath41-dimensional mapping of the form @xmath42 on some @xmath41-dimensional phase space @xmath43 .",
    "we can numerically generate data from such a mapping equation that describes dynamics of a specific dynamical system .",
    "we particularly focus on two examples .",
    "one is the logistic map given as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 $ ] is a control parameter and the map is confined to the interval @xmath46 $ ] , which exhibits periodic route to chaos . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the system is ( semi)conjugated to a bernoulli shift and strongly mixing .",
    "the other is the sine - circle map given as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a point on a circle and parameter @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 ) is a measure of the strength of the nonlinearity , whichs exhibit periodic route to chaos .",
    "it describes dynamical systems possessing a natural frequency @xmath52 which are driven by an external force of frequency @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is the bare winding number or frequency - ratio parameter ) and belongs to the same universality class of the forced rayleigh - benard convection @xcite .",
    "winding number for this map is defined to be the limit of the ratio    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the angular distance travelled after @xmath10 iterations of the map function . to increase the degree of irrationality of the system ,",
    "one could use frequency ratio parameter @xmath57 corresponding to winding number @xmath58 that approaches the golden mean gradually by following the sequence of ratios of the fibonacci numbers ( @xmath59 ) . the map is monotonic and invertible ( non - monotonic and non - invertible ) for @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) and develops a cubic inflexion point at @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "considering technical details , it is important to emphasize that we added gaussian white noise into systems in eqs .",
    "( [ logisticmap ] ) and ( [ circlemap ] ) with a small intensity @xmath64 , which is called basic noise , to every state .",
    "the low intensity of the noise is chosen so as not to influence the dynamics of these systems .",
    "this procedure enables a continuous spectral distribution @xmath65 .",
    "after 65536 transients , we generated the discrete sequences with the length of @xmath66 points separately obtained from eq .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "finally , the spectrum of 18 shifted windows of 4096 samples @xmath67 is estimated and averaged .",
    "one of the dynamical systems possessing bifurcation properties can be cited as the logistic map , which moves from a unique stable fixed point to the critical accumulation point possessing infinite periods through the periodic doubling route .",
    "having reached the critical accumulation point , the system enters into the chaotic regime and from this point on it moves under the influence of chaotic band merging ( i.e. , inverse period - doubling ) .",
    "it should also be remarked that periodic windows with different periods but albeit self - similar structures are also found in this chaotic regime .",
    "we now present the results concerning the behavior of the renormalized entropy and the bifurcation properties in the regions of period @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . before proceeding further",
    ", we note that the renormalized entropy has already been applied to the logistic map for period-2 window by saparin _",
    "our aim in this section is to investigate all other self - similar windows to check whether the renormalized entropy behaves consistently as a complexity measure , i.e. , to check its robustness .",
    "1a in particular shows the behavior of the renormalized entropy in the period 2 region where control parameter @xmath11 lies between @xmath1 and @xmath68 . in this region , relative degree of order increases until the period accumulation point i.e. , @xmath69 as the system evolves from the equilibrium state to a new stationary state in accordance with the self - organization process . as a signature of the detection of the self - organization in this region",
    "then , the relative entropy monotonically decreases as expected . after the period @xmath0 accumulation point onward until the most chaotic state with @xmath47 , the relative degree of order decreases , since band - merging ( as opposed to bifurcation in the previous region ) is exhibited by the system in this region .",
    "therefore , the renormalized entropy increases in the aforementioned region in a non - monotonic manner . to sum up , for an open non - equilibrium dynamical system which approaches the stationary state through period - doubling and recedes away from the stationary state by means of band - merging , the behavior of the renormalized entropy conforms to the dictum of prigogine i.e. , order out of chaos . in fig",
    "1b , we zoom in the period @xmath1 window i.e. , the largest self - similar window in the period @xmath0 region .",
    "the control parameter values for this window are confined in the interval between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "similarly to the period @xmath0 window , the relative degree of order monotonically increases up to the period accumulation point @xmath72 , and thereafter decreases non - monotonically .",
    "accordingly , the relative entropy decreases up to the accumulation point , and begins to increase after the period accumulation point .",
    "it is worth noting the sudden , unexpected changes in the values of the renormalized entropy which signal the existence of the self - similar windows in the chaotic region .",
    "1c shows the behavior of the renormalized entropy in the period @xmath2 window , which is one of the self - similar windows in the logistic map . due to the self - similarity",
    ", a behavior similar to the one in period @xmath1 is exhibited by the renormalized entropy : it decreases almost up to @xmath73 , and then begins to increase in accordance with the decrease in the relative degree of order .",

    "the system dynamics is either periodic ( frequency - locked ) or quasi - periodic depending on the value of the frequency ratio parameter @xmath57 being rational or irrational .",
    "as the nonlinearity parameter @xmath50 approaches zero , the system exhibits quasi - periodic behavior for all values of the frequency ratio parameter @xmath57 .",
    "as the nonlinearity parameter @xmath50 approaches one , frequency - locked steps extend and occupy all @xmath57 axes where @xmath50 is equal to one . in this case , there is a special fraction of @xmath57 value called the most irrational @xmath75 , corresponding to the `` golden mean '' winding number @xmath58 if frequency ratio parameter @xmath57 is locked to its critical value @xmath75 . shortly after this critical value on @xmath76 plane , @xmath77 is the edge of quasi - periodic route to chaos since chaotic behavior can occur .",
