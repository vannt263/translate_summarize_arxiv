    "the galilean satellites are thought to have internal global liquid layers .",
    "in particular , europa , ganymede and callisto likely have an internal global ocean beneath their external ice shell ( see khurana et al .",
    "1998 and kivelson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it has been shown that observations of longitudinal librations could be used to assess the presence of these liquid layers ( van hoolst et al .",
    "2008 , baland and van hoolst 2010 , rambaux et al . 2011 ) .",
    "another aspect of the rotation state of a synchronous satellite is the time evolution of the orientation of its rotation axis with respect to the normal to its orbit . in general ,",
    "synchronous satellites are assumed to be locked in a cassini state , an equilibrium state of a tidally evolved synchronous satellite .",
    "this study focuses on the dependence of the obliquity of the galilean satellites on their internal structure .",
    "we assess whether the knowledge of the galilean satellites obliquity could help confirming the presence of internal global liquid layers in these satellites .",
    "the obliquity of the galilean satellites is not yet observed but is assumed to be small because it was not detected in gravity measurements ( e.g. anderson et al .",
    "1998 ) . in recent studies ,",
    "estimates of the obliquity of europa have been obtained from observations of the cycloidal lineaments and strike - slip faults ( e.g. rhoden et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "they suggest an order of magnitude from a few tenths of a degree to a degree for europa s obliquity .",
    "observations of the obliquity and of the librations for europa and maybe for ganymede are expected in the near future , thanks to radar echoes from the satellite s surfaces observed from two separate earth stations ( margot 2011 ) .",
    "this technique has been proved to be efficient , since it allowed the detection of a forced libration and of a non - zero obliquity for mercury , which confirmed that this planet has a molten core and is in a cassini state ( margot et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in this paper , we apply the cassini state model for a synchronous satellite with a liquid ocean , developed and applied to titan in baland et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , to the galilean satellites .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the cassini state model for an entirely solid satellite , based on the model of bills ( 2005 ) , and we compare his results with ours . in the third section ,",
    "we extend the model taking into account the presence of an internal liquid layer and the resulting gravitational and pressure torques between the different layers of a satellite . in the same section",
    ", we present the results for the liquid layer case for the four satellites and we assess the possibility to detect a fluid layer and to constrain the satellite s interior structure from obliquity observations .",
    "the last section contains a discussion of our results and the conclusions .",
    "let us first consider that the galilean satellites are entirely solid . if principal axis rotation is assumed , that is to say that a possible wobble is neglected , the angular momentum equation governing the obliquity of a synchronous satellite is ( see bills ( 2005 ) and the demonstration given in appendix [ append ] ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the unit vectors along the rotation axis and the normal to the orbit , expressed in cartesian coordinates @xmath7 of the laplace plane and @xmath8 along the normal to it . the laplace plane is the mean orbital plane of the satellite with respect to which the orbital precession is defined and is here considered as the equatorial plane of an inertial reference frame . the mean motion , equal to the mean rotation rate ,",
    "is denoted by @xmath9 and the mass and the radius of the satellite by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the second - degree gravity field coefficients of the satellite , which can be expressed in terms of @xmath14 , the principal moments of inertia . the left - hand member of eq .",
    "( [ rigidcase ] ) is the variation of the angular momentum while the right - hand member is the gravitational torque ( averaged over the orbital period ) exerted by the planet jupiter that tends to align the rotation axis with the orbit normal .",
    "a perfect permanent alignment is impossible to achieve because of the continuous precession , leading to a non - zero obliquity .",
    "following bills ( 2005 ) , this vectorial equation ( [ rigidcase ] ) is projected on the laplace plane , @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "this equation is correct up to the first order in small obliquity , eccentricity and orbital inclination .    equation ( [ rigidprojected ] ) allows the study of the classical cassini state , where the precession rate @xmath19 is constant , as well as the study of the generalization to a multi - frequency node precession ( bills 2005 ) . in the latter case",
    ", the orbital precession can be written as a series expansion @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the inclination amplitudes associated with the orbital node precession frequencies @xmath22 and the phases @xmath23 . the actual orbital inclination @xmath24 , which is the angle between the normal to the laplace plane and the normal to the orbit , is not constant over time and",
    "is given , at the first order , by @xmath25 the parameter @xmath26 is the main precession rate of the orbital plane , with respect to the laplace plane , which is the only frequency considered in the classical cassini state .",
    "in that case , the orbital inclination @xmath24 stays constant in time and is equal to the inclination amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "the forced precession of the rotation axis induced by the precession of the orbital plane ( [ precession ] ) is given by the forced solution of equation ( [ rigidprojected ] ) : @xmath28 where , correct up to the first order in @xmath29 and @xmath21 , the obliquity amplitudes @xmath29 associated with the frequencies @xmath22 are given by @xmath30 in which @xmath31 is the frequency of the free spin precession obtained by averaging the torque over a time scale larger than the precession time scale , or equivalently by setting @xmath32 to zero . in the series expansion of eq .",
    "( [ precession ] ) , the inclination amplitudes @xmath21 are ordered such that their magnitude decreases with increasing subscript @xmath33 .",
    "the obliquity amplitudes @xmath29 do not necessarily follow this trend , because @xmath21 is multiplied by @xmath22 in the numerator of the solution ( [ rigidfirstorder ] ) and because the denominator @xmath34 may be small and lead to large value of @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath29 is significantly amplified due to @xmath35 being close to @xmath36 , one can speak of a resonance between the free mode and the forcing frequency . in the classical cassini state ,",
    "the obliquity is given by @xmath37 and is constant , but in the generalized cassini state , the obliquity is time - variable and is given by ( see also bills and nimmo 2011a ) @xmath38 in the classical cassini state , the rotation axis , the normal to the orbit and the normal to the laplace plane remain in the same plane . in the generalized cassini state ,",
    "the rotation axis presents a time - variable deviation with respect to the plane defined by the two other axes .",
    "an expression of this deviation can easily be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ precession ] ) and ( [ forcedsol ] ) ( see eq .",
    "( 9 ) of baland et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the deviation is close to zero when none of the obliquity amplitudes are amplified by a resonance , or equivalently when the rotation state is close to the classical cassini state , while the obliquity is non - zero and close to @xmath39 .",
    "deviation and obliquity variations depend both on obliquity amplitudes @xmath29",
    ". the trajectories of @xmath32 and @xmath40 on the laplace place are seen as the composition of circular motions ( see eqs .",
    "( [ precession ] ) and ( [ forcedsol ] ) , see also fig . 3 of baland et al .",
    "it then follows from the geometry of the problem that the time periodic variations of the deviation around zero have amplitudes of the same order of magnitude as the amplitude of the time periodic variation of the obliquity around @xmath39 , but that they are out of phase , since the deviation is maximum when the obliquity is close to its mean value .",
    "therefore , study both the variations of the obliquity and of the deviation is somewhat redundant . in the following",
    ", we will focus on the numerical results for the obliquity and their interpretation in terms of internal structure .",
    "nevertheless , future observations of the rotation state of the galilean satellites should be interpreted in term of internal structure by taking into account the obliquity and the deviation in the case of resonant amplification , as it was done for titan in baland et al .",
    "the measured deviation could help to check the consistency of the model and , if more than one resonant amplification is able to explain a large measured obliquity , to chose among them .",
    "we calculate the obliquity of the cassini state for the galilean satellites assuming that they are entirely solid .",
    "the numerical values of the radius @xmath11 and of the mean density @xmath41 , which give the mass @xmath10 , and of the gravity field coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 , according to schubert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , are given in table 1 for the four galilean satellites .",
    "the normalized mean moment of inertia @xmath42 can be obtained using the extension of radau s equation to synchronous triaxial bodies ( see van hoolst et al .",
    "table 1 also gives the mean motion @xmath9 according to lainey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and an estimation of the free precession period @xmath43 using eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) and the approximation @xmath44 . for io , europa and callisto",
    ", @xmath45 is in a satisfying agreement with previous studies based on the hamiltonian mechanics ( henrard 2005b gives @xmath46 years for io , henrard 2005a gives @xmath47 years for europa and noyelles 2009 gives @xmath48 years for callisto ) .",
    "the parameters of the orbital precession series expansion ( orbital inclination amplitudes @xmath21 , precession frequencies @xmath22 and their corresponding period @xmath49 , and phase angles @xmath23 ) have been taken from lainey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and are given respectively in tables 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 for io , europa , ganymede and callisto .",
    "the last column of tables 2 - 5 gives the obliquity amplitudes @xmath29 computed with eq .",
    "( [ rigidfirstorder ] ) .",
    "significant resonant amplifications occur in the solid case for the subscript @xmath50 for io , @xmath51 for ganymede , and @xmath52 for callisto , but there is no significant resonance for a solid europa . as a result , the solid case obliquity of europa remains close ( at the 6 percent level ) to the constant value of the classical cassini state ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this is one order of magnitude lower than the estimate of @xmath54 obtained from the observations of cycloidal lineaments ( rhoden et al .",
    "2010 ) and the one of @xmath55 from strike - slip fault patterns ( rhoden et al .",
    "the obliquity of io oscillates essentially between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "obliquities of ganymede and of callisto evolve respectively in the ranges @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the time evolution of the orbital inclination @xmath24 and of the obliquity @xmath60 , computed with eqs .",
    "( [ incl ] ) and ( [ obl ] ) , is illustrated in fig . 1 for the four galilean satellites .",
    "we have chosen j2000 as the time origin .",
    "the width of the time spans are the same as in bills ( 2005 ) to facilitate the comparison with his figure 3 which represents also the time evolution of @xmath24 and @xmath60 of the four satellites computed from the same equations but with different ephemerides .",
    "a visual comparison indicates clearly that we are far from agreement , both for the orbital inclination and the obliquity .",
    "an obvious cause for this difference is the error which has lead to the absence of the coefficient @xmath13 in the angular momentum equation of bills ( 2005 ) ( see his equation 46 which is the equivalent of equation [ rigidfirstorder ] of the present paper ) .",
    "this changes the numerical values of the frequency @xmath35 and so of the obliquity amplitudes @xmath29 by affecting possible resonant amplifications .",
    "this effect alone , however , is not sufficient to explain the differences between our curves for the obliquity and those of bills .",
    "moreover , it does not affect the inclinations .",
    "part of the difference may also be due to a possible different use of ephemerides .",
    "bills ( 2005 ) used the ephemerides of lieske ( 1998 ) to calculate the parameters of the orbital precession series expansion of eq .",
    "( [ precession ] ) . as those ephemerides are expressed with respect to the equatorial plane of jupiter , this plane was most likely considered as the inertial plane of reference , instead of the laplace plane . here",
    ", we use the synthetic representation of ephemerides of lainey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , also expressed with respect to the equatorial plane of jupiter , but which could easily be corrected for the difference with respect to the laplace plane . in the expansions for the orbital precessions given in lainey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we simply neglect a term with precession frequency equal to zero , which gives the orientation of the laplace plane with respect to the equatorial plane of jupiter . introducing that term in expansion ( [ precession ] )",
    ", we find orbital inclinations that are in a better agreement with the ones of bills ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , the obliquity is not affected by the choice of the reference plane .    the remaining differences might be caused by possible differences in the phases @xmath23 used in solution ( [ forcedsol ] ) and , more generally , by the differences between the different ephemerides used that can affect the possible resonant amplifications , particularly in the case of io for which the orbital inclination behavior presented in bills ( 2005 ) seems to be the combination of a few terms in the expansion ( [ precession ] ) .",
    "we develop a generalized cassini state model for a generic satellite made up of three uniform and homogeneous layers : a rigid ice shell ( @xmath61 ) , a liquid water ocean ( @xmath62 ) and a rigid interior ( @xmath63 ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "this definition is adequate for europa , ganymede and callisto . for io ,",
    "the shell will be replaced by a rigid rock mantle ( @xmath64 ) , the water ocean by a fluid core ( @xmath65 ) , and no solid interior will be considered .    for the generic satellite , the orientation of each layer will in principle",
    "be described by one angular momentum equation .",
    "an external gravitational torque exerted by the central planet applies on each layer , as well as torques resulting from gravitational and pressure interactions between the layers . under the assumption that the liquid is in hydrostatic equilibrium , the total torque on the liquid layer vanishes ( baland et al .",
    "therefore we only consider the orientation of the unit vectors along the rotation axes of the shell ( @xmath66 ) and the interior ( @xmath67 ) , which can have different obliquities ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) with respect to the normal to the orbit @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "the system then reduces to two angular momentum equations , which can be written correct up to the first order in obliquity and inclination as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the projections on the laplace plane of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the polar moment of inertia of the two solid layers . @xmath76",

    "this , however , is not problematic since the obliquity of the galilean satellites is known to be less than about @xmath105 deg ( as can be estimated from the observed gravitational coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) , in which case the small angles assumption leads at most to an error of a few percent for obliquity amplitudes of a few degrees . any internal structure model that would reach very high obliquity values can be excluded and we can consider that our solution is valid for application to the galilean satellites ..    [ [ io ] ] io ~~    we consider that io consists of two homogeneous layers : a solid silicate mantle over a liquid iron - sulfur core .",
    "the core density is chosen in the range @xmath108 $ ] kg / m@xmath109 , depending on the content in light elements ( see anderson et al .",
    "2001b , spohn et al .",

    "the interior structure is characterized by four parameters which are the radius and density of the core and of the mantle ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) , and is constrained by the mean radius @xmath11 , the mass @xmath10 , and the mean moment inertia @xmath42 given in tab .",
    "1 . obviously , the radius of the mantle is equal to the radius of the satellite , so that @xmath114 . with the two remaining constraints ( @xmath10 and @xmath42 ) , the solution for the three remaining parameters ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath110 ) is not unique .",
    "however , given the possible range of core densities @xmath112 , we can find limit values for the density and the thickness of the mantle .",
    "since the mantle thickness is given by @xmath115 , a core density @xmath112 of @xmath116 kg / m@xmath109 corresponds to a mantle thickness @xmath117 of @xmath118 km and a mantle density @xmath113 of @xmath119 kg / m@xmath109 . if @xmath112 is @xmath120 kg / m@xmath109 , then @xmath121 km and @xmath122 kg / m@xmath109 .",

    "only @xmath142 competes with @xmath141 , @xmath152 can not be neglected in front of @xmath145 and @xmath142 is from @xmath153 to @xmath154 smaller than for the solid case ( see also tab .",
    "6 ) .    since the obliquity amplitudes of the fluid core case are close to those of the entirely solid case , the actual time - dependent obliquity of both cases are similar , as can be seen in fig .",

    "constraining the mantle thickness to a ten - kilometer level will be even more challenging and would require a precision improved by a factor ten .",
    "we do not think that such an accuracy could be achieved in the near future , since , for instance , the accuracy on future europa s obliquity measurement from the earth is expected to be of the order of @xmath158 ( margot 2011 ) and since no space mission dedicated to io is planned .",
    "anderson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded from galileo gravity measurements that europa is differentiated into a metallic core , a rocky mantle and a liquid / ice water layer .",
    "the detection of an induced magnetic field ( khurana et al .",
    "1998 ) indicates that a liquid layer would exist between the ice surface and the rocky interior .",
    "therefore , we consider that europa is made of four homogeneous layers , from the center to the surface : an iron - sulfur core ( c ) , a rock mantle ( r ) , a liquid water ocean ( o ) , and a water ice shell ( sh ) . the mantle and the core together form a solid layer to which we refer as the interior ( in ) . since the mean radius @xmath11 , given in tab .",

    "we then compute @xmath164 and @xmath163 from @xmath10 and @xmath42 for any chosen set of values .",
    "we only retain solutions for which @xmath174 kg / m@xmath109 , @xmath175 kg / m@xmath109 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",
    "this procedure provides @xmath178 solutions for the internal structure .    in order to easily identify the possible resonant amplification that might occur with some negative periods @xmath49 of the orbital precession ,",

    "nevertheless , the resonant amplifications for @xmath186 or @xmath50 are not important enough to allow the corresponding obliquity amplitudes of the shell and of the interior to compete with those corresponding to the main frequency precession @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . as a result ,",
    "the solution ( [ ssh]-[sin ] ) is dominated by the first term of its series expansion , as for an entirely solid europa , and the orientation of the rotation axis of the different layers is close to the coplanarity with the normal to the orbit and the normal to the laplace plane .",

    "if @xmath256 and @xmath230 are not strongly amplified , the largest difference in the time interval ( 2010 - 2040 ) is about @xmath266 . again assuming a @xmath208 error as large as this difference",
    ", the measurement precision of the rotation axis on callisto s surface should be about @xmath267 km , which is possible wih a mission like juice . as for ganymede , a measured obliquity compatible with the solid case does not mean that there is no internal ocean , since several internal structure models with an ocean can have , at a given time , a similar obliquity as in the rigid case .",
    "a long - term monitoring of the shell obliquity of callisto would be more helpful to discrimate among the possible internal structure models .",
    "we have computed the obliquity of the four galilean satellites for a wide and representative range of internal structure models with homogeneous layers , consistent with the constraints on radius , mass and mean moment of inertia provided by the galileo spacecraft mission .",
    "we have assumed that the satellites are locked in a cassini state .",
    "therefore , we used a model for the obliquity based on the cassini state and extended to the presence of an internal liquid layer , including the internal gravitational and pressure torques induced by the presence of this layer . the model used in this study is also generalised to a multi - frequency orbital precession of the satellites .",
    "with this model , we have shown that the surface layer obliquity of io does not present a large variety for the different internal structure models considered .",
    "the obliquity of europa is almost constant and its mean value is larger for a thicker ice shell , although it depends also on other characteristic of its interior .",
    "the internal structure models of ganymede and callisto present more various behaviors in the shell obliquity , because of the possibility of combined resonant amplifications for some periodic terms of the solution .",
    "we have compared the time - behavior of the surface layer obliquity with the behavior in the case of an entirely solid satellite , to assess the possibility to detect the considered liquid layer from a single or multiple obliquity measurement . for io and europa , an accuracy of about @xmath157 m and @xmath268 m",
    "would be needed , respectively , on the location of the rotation axis at the surface .",
    "the ocean of ganymede and callisto may be more easily detected if the actual internal structure model would lead to a very different value of the obliquity than in the solide case . in the best case ,",
    "a precision of about @xmath239 m and @xmath267 km for ganymede and callisto would be sufficient .",
    "however , for ganymede and callisto , a measured obliquity compatible with the entirely solid case would not exclude the existence of an internal ocean , since some internal structure models with an ocean can not be distinguished from the solid case at some given times . in any case , for ganymede and callisto , the combination of many obliquity measurements spread over several decades would be needed to learn more about their internal structure .",
    "this is a reason why the planned ground observations of the rotation state of ganymede is of interest , though being probably less accurate than any potential measurements from a spacecraft that would reach ganymede around the year 2030 . to interpret forthcoming measurements , one has to ensure that the error on the knowledge of the orbital plane orientation of the considered satellite is properly taken into account , since the rotation axis orientation would be measured with respect to a standard reference frame which is the icrf , and not directly with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "we note that the theoretical values for the obliquity of europa with ( of the order of @xmath232 deg ) or without ocean ( @xmath1 deg ) are not consistent with the estimates of about @xmath269 deg by rhoden et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) , inferred from the observations of cycloidal lineaments and strike - slip fault patterns .",
    "the pressure effect on the density profile can not be of a great importance because of the relative smallness of europa and can not explain the mismatch .",
    "also the assumption of a different density profile not associated with the normalized mean moment of inertia of 0.356 related to the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium leads only to a difference of about 10% on europa s obliquity with respect to our results .",
    "this indicates that it is impossible with our obliquity model and for any reasonable internal structure model for europa to reach the high obliquity value of rhoden et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) , unless a free mode would be excited to such a value because of a recent excitation .",
    "the obliquity of rhoden s studies may reflect the past rotation state of europa associated with the past orbital state and its past internal structure . in our study",
    ", we use the ephemerides of lainey et al .",
    "( 2006 ) which are valid for a short time span in the past ( of the order of @xmath270 years ) compared to the age of europa s surface ( @xmath271 years ) and we are of course considering the present internal structure .",
    "+ we have considered internal structure models for the satellites that have homogeneous and uniform layers with flatennings computed by solving clairaut s equation , in order to keep a relative simplicity in our assessment of the effect of interior parameters such as the ice shell thickness on the solution for the rotation axis orientation . however",
    ", any forthcoming measurement would need to be interpreted in terms of more realistic models for the internal structure , in particular if the measurement indicates that a resonant amplification is at work .",
    "indeed , in a resonant case , the solution is very sensitive to any change in the internal structure . for instance , the pressure effect on the density of the materials could be considered for ganymede and callisto which are large satellites .",
    "another possibility would be that the icy satellites slightly depart from the hydrostatic equilibrium because , for instance , of differential tidal heating which could flatten the poles ( lateral shell thickness variations ) , as it is assumed to be the case for titan ( nimmo and bills 2010 ) .",
    "we note that the general solution for the cassini state that we have derived in this paper is valid also for non - hydrostatic internal structure models and or non hydrostatic flattenings , allowing us to realize some tests .",
    "for instance , multiplying and dividing the polar flatennings of the surface and of the ocean - ice interface , respectively , by a factor two with respect to the hydrostatic case decreases the first obliquity amplitude of europa by only about @xmath272 .",
    "given the unknown internal structure of the galilean satellites , it seems reasonable for now to consider hydrostatic flattenings as a good first order approximation .",

    "<S> the obliquity of ganymede and callisto depends more on their interior structure because of the possibility of resonant amplifications for some periodic terms of the solution . </S>",
    "<S> their ocean may be easily detected if , at the measuring time , the actual internal structure model lead to a very different value of the obliquity than in the solid case . </S>",
