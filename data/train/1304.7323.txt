    "in recent years many analogs of the atomic interference effects  @xcite have been extensively studied in optomechanical systems [ oms ] . these include effects like electromagnetically induced transparency [ eit ]  @xcite and absorption  @xcite , fano minima  @xcite .",
    "such interference effects have led to the possibility of using oms for storing optical pulses and more generally as optical memory elements  @xcite . in eit in oms",
    "the cavity field vanishes and the output field is coherent and exactly equal to the input at eit condition . in this paper we examine the possibility of confining light in the cavity with output equal to zero .",
    "we note that this can be considered as the inverse eit ( ieit ) .",
    "the effect is similar to the coherent perfect absorption studied in the context of linear dielectrics  @xcite . in spite of the similarities there",
    "are differences as we deal with an active system and the entire effect is induced by the presence of a control field and hence it is appropriate to use the term ieit in analogy to other electromagnetic field induced effects like eit and eia . the studies that we present in this paper deal with a system which is intrinsically nonlinear @xcite . here",
    "the nonlinearity arises from the radiation pressure interaction between the mirror and the cavity field .",
    "the dynamics of the cavity field and the mirror is completely described within the microscopic framework so that one is able to monitor dynamical changes in both the cavity field and the mechanical mirror .",
    "another question of great importance is - where does the energy reside in the ieit as it results from interference between coherent beams .",
    "thus the question is - is the energy converted to heat or the energy resides in coherent vibrations , i.e. , in the polaritons of the medium .",
    "our microscopic approach shows that the coherent energy indeed gets converted to coherent internal vibrations of the mirror and the cavity field .",
    "we further find that at the ieit conditions essentially only one of the two polariton modes is primarily excited .",
    "we present explicitly conditions on the dissipation of the mirror , the cavity damping , and the power of the pump laser to obtain the frequencies at which the ieit occurs .",
    "the frequency of the ieit can be tailored by changing the power and the frequency of the controlling electromagnetic field .",
    "this is where the nonlinearity of the radiation pressure interaction is useful , and thus our system can be used as a filter of frequencies which in turn would depend on the bandwidth of the incoming pump laser .",
    "we also note that since the ieit arises from interference , the transmission of fields can be restored by changing the conditions for interference .",
    "the ieit that we discuss is different from the eia of references  @xcite which occurs when the control field is blue detuned and the eia of  @xcite which can occur only for double cavity systems .",
    "besides in ieit the fields are completely confined inside the cavity .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model under study , derive the quantum langevin equations , and give the steady - state mean values .",
    "then we linearize the quantum langevin equations , make rotating wave approximation , and obtain the mechanical excitation and the cavity field at the probe frequency . in section 3 , we calculate the output probe fields , show the ieit in the output probe fields , derive the conditions for the ieit occurrence , analyze where the energy goes and answer the question of the energy transfer to the normal modes when the ieit occurs .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the studied system consists of a partially transmitting movable mirror located around the middle position of the fabry - perot cavity formed by two fixed mirrors with finite equal transmission  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . such a system has been recently used @xcite to demonstrate eit at room temperature .",
    "the cavity field is driven by a strong coupling field with frequency @xmath1 and amplitude @xmath2 from the left - hand side of the cavity . meanwhile ,",
    "two weak classical probe fields with identical frequency @xmath3 are sent into the cavity from the opposite sides of the cavity , respectively , their complex amplitudes are denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the movable mirror makes small oscillations under the action of the radiation pressure force exerted by the photons within the cavity . in turn",
    ", the mechanical displacement @xmath6 modifies the cavity resonance frequency , represented by @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the movable mirror is placed at the node of the frequency @xmath7 of the cavity field , thus @xmath7 depends linearly on the mechanical displacement @xmath6 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the resonance frequency of the cavity in the absence of the moving mirror , the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath10 depends on the transmission @xmath11 of the movable mirror @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the wave vector of the cavity field , @xmath14 is the rest position of the moving mirror in the absence of radiation . here",
    ", the macroscopic movable mirror is treated as a quantum oscillator with effective mass @xmath15 and resonance frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the rotating frame at the frequency of the coupling field @xmath1 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity mode with commutation relation @xmath20=1 $ ] , @xmath21 is the momentum operator of the movable mirror , the amplitude @xmath2 of the coupling field is determined by the power @xmath22 of the coupling field @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the detuning between the probe field and the coupling field",
    ". it will be more convenient to write the position and momentum operators of the mirror in terms of the annihilation operator ( @xmath25 ) and creation operator ( @xmath26 ) of the mirror with @xmath27=1 $ ] , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , the hamiltonian of the system can be rewritten as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the frequency shift of the cavity field induced by the zero - point motion of the mirror . using the heisenberg equations of motion and taking into account the corresponding damping and noise terms",
    ", one gets the quantum langevin equations for the operators of the mechanical and optical modes @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the mechanical damping rate due to the coupling of the movable mirror to the thermal environment , @xmath34 is the cavity photon decay rate due to transmission losses through each end mirror of the cavity , @xmath35 is the thermal noise on the movable mirror with zero mean value , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the input quantum vacuum noise operator coming from the left- ( right- ) hand side of the cavity with zero mean value .    in the absence of the probe fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the mean values in the steady state",
    "can be obtained from ( 3 ) by factorization @xmath38 etc , @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the effective detuning between the cavity field and the coupling field , including the frequency shift caused by the mechanical motion , @xmath41 determines the mechanical displacement at the steady state , and @xmath42 is the cavity field amplitude at the steady state .    to solve the nonlinear coupled equations ( [ 3 ] ) , we write each operator as the sum of the mean value and the small quantum fluctuation around this mean value i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . inserting them into eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , keeping only the linear terms , we obtain the linearized quantum langevin equations @xmath47-\\frac{\\gamma_{m}}{2}\\delta \\tilde{b } + \\sqrt{\\gamma_{m}}\\tilde{b}_{in},\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta \\dot{\\tilde{c}}&=&-2\\kappa \\delta \\tilde{c}-igc_{s}[\\delta \\tilde{b}e^{-i(\\omega_{m}-\\delta)t}+\\delta \\tilde{b}^{\\dag}e^{i(\\omega_{m}+\\delta)t}]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\varepsilon_{l}e^{-i(\\delta-\\delta)t}+\\varepsilon_{r}e^{-i(\\delta-\\delta)t}+\\sqrt{2\\kappa}\\tilde{c}_{in}+\\sqrt{2\\kappa}\\tilde{d}_{in},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the slowly moving operators with tildes , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "if the cavity is driven by a coupling field at the mechanical red sideband @xmath53 , the system is operating in the resolved sideband regime @xmath54 , the mirror has a high mechanical quality factor @xmath55 , and the mechanical frequency @xmath16 is much larger than @xmath56 , the fast oscillating terms @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) can be ignored , eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) simplifies to @xmath58 where @xmath59 , the detuning of the probe field from the cavity resonance frequency .",
    "then we examine the expectation values of the small fluctuations , and note that the mean values of the quantum and thermal noise terms are zero .",
    "we write the solution for mean values in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 or @xmath18 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the components of @xmath64 oscillating at @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the rotating frame at frequency @xmath1 , respectively , then we obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the effective optomechanical coupling rate , which is related to the power @xmath22 of the coupling field .",
    "we have treated eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) in the linearized approximation which so far has been quite common .",
    "consequences of going beyond linear approximation have started being examined @xcite .",
    "drawing on the findings of the ref .",
    "@xcite we expect that the nonlinearities can be used to tune the position where the ieit occurs .",
    "in this section , we calculate the output fields at the probe frequency @xmath3 to bring out the ieit phenomenon due to the interaction of the movable mirror with a strong coupling field and two weak probe fields .    the output fields of the two sides of the cavity can be derived by the input - output relations @xcite .",
    "they yields @xmath69 similarly , we write the output fields as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is oscillating at frequency @xmath3 in the original frame , @xmath72 is oscillating at frequency @xmath73 in the original frame . from eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , we obtain the output fields at the probe frequency @xmath74 we find if the conditions @xmath75 are satisfied , then the output fields are zero @xmath76 therefore , the input probe fields are fully absorbed by this nonlinear optomechanical system without being reflected or transmitted .",
    "this is the result of the destructive interference between the reflected light of say left going probe field and the transmitted light from the probe field on the right .",
    "hence this optomechanical system can achieve the ieit . to make @xmath77 real",
    ", the effective coupling rate should be not less than the total cavity photon decay rate , i.e. , @xmath78 . for @xmath79",
    ", the ieit happens at @xmath80 , which means that the probe fields are resonant with the optical cavity .",
    "further , by adjusting the power of the coupling field , the optomechanical system can entirely absorb the incoming two probe fields with equal frequency at @xmath81 .",
    "clearly the transmission can be restored by changing any of the three conditions in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) . one simple way is by changing the relative phase between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the ieit occurs under conditions which are very different from the conditions for eit .",
    "this is expected as for confinement of light we need good absorption and thus for ieit we need a condition @xmath82 which is different from the one , @xmath83 for eit .",
    "next we examine the question where the energy resides when the ieit occurs . for this purpose",
    ", we examine the intracavity probe photon number @xmath84 and the quantum excitation @xmath85 in the movable mirror when the ieit happens . substituting @xmath86 , @xmath82 , and @xmath77 into eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , we find that the normalized intracavity probe photon number , defined as the ratio of the intracavity probe photon number @xmath84 versus the intracavity probe photon number @xmath87 without the coupling field , is @xmath88 from eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , when @xmath86 , @xmath82 , and @xmath77 , the normalized mechanical excitation is @xmath89 therefore , when the ieit occurs , the intracavity probe photon number is equal to the mechanical excitation .",
    "thus the energy of the input probe fields are totally transferred into the cavity field and the movable mirror , which have equal excitation .",
    "further both the cavity mode and the phonon mode are coherently excited .    in the following ,",
    "we numerically evaluate the output probe photon number , the intracavity probe photon number , and the mechanical excitation to show the effect of the power of the coupling field on the ieit . the normalized output probe photon number @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , the normalized probe photon number @xmath92 in the cavity , and the normalized mechanical excitation @xmath93 as a function of the probe detuning @xmath94 for different effective coupling rates ( @xmath95 )",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] . for @xmath79",
    ", it is seen that when @xmath80 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . for @xmath99 or @xmath100",
    ", one can see that when @xmath77 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "these results are consistent with the analytical results ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "in addition , in the strong coupling regime @xmath101 , two dips or two peaks appear in the output probe field , the intracavity probe field , and the mechanical excitation , this is the optomechanical normal mode splitting phenomenon  @xcite in the pump probe response of the optomechanical system as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) which has poles at @xmath102 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the width and the location of the poles are comparable and this is the reason for broad structure at @xmath80 in the mechanical excitation .",
    "we next examine the question of energy transfer to the normal modes under the conditions of the ieit . from eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , we obtain the equations for the components @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the @xmath107 matrix @xmath108    note that the normal modes for the matrix @xmath106 are related to @xmath109 and @xmath110 via @xmath111 .",
    "this is after we have removed the phase of @xmath42 via a redefinition of the variables .",
    "then the relation ( [ 8 ] ) leads to @xmath112}{|(2\\kappa - ix)^2+g^2|^2}$ ] . when @xmath113 , @xmath114 . when @xmath115 , @xmath116",
    ". therefore at the ieit only one of the normal modes is excited .",
    "the dependence of the normalized modulus square of the normal modes @xmath117 for @xmath118 on the probe detuning @xmath94 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the ieit occurs at @xmath119 . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we find that @xmath120 and @xmath121 at @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 at @xmath125 .",
    "thus only one of the normal modes is excited when the ieit occurs .",
    "finally we also mention that in the above analysis we have assumed that the pump detuning @xmath126 is equal to the frequency @xmath16 of the mechanical oscillator . for @xmath127 , more general results including fano profiles  @xcite would be obtained .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown the ieit in an optomechanical setup formed by a vibrating mirror within a fabry - perot cavity under the action of a strong coupling field .",
    "we show that the energy of the incoming probe fields is shared by the intracavity field and the movable mirror as they propagate through the optomechanical system .",
    "further , we show that our optomechanical system can absorb the incident probe fields spanning a broad range of frequencies by varying the power and the frequency of the coupling field as long as the optomechanical interaction is not slower than the irreversible processes due to loss of photons out of the cavity mode @xmath128 .",
    "this property is clearly useful for filtering out frequencies for example from a probe pulse by using a pump with an appropriate spectral distribution . for the optomechanical system ,",
    "the absorbed energy is stored in the coherent excitations of the mirror and the cavity , and thus the energy can be extracted by applying external perturbation fields or by suddenly decreasing the cavity quality factor @xmath0 .",
    "finally we note that the study of the ieit with quantized fields would be very interesting  @xcite .",
    "we hope to return to this question in a later paper .",
    "this work was supported by the singapore national research foundation under nrf grant no .",
    "nrf - nrff 2011 - 07 .",
    "+ _ note added in proofs . _",
    "although in the main body of the paper we assumed that there is no internal loss in the resonator . in practice",
    "many resonators suffer from the internal loss @xcite say at the rate @xmath129 . then the conditions for @xmath130 and @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) are modified by the replacement of @xmath131 by @xmath132 .",
    "the internal loss is then useful in the realization of the effect of this paper in cases where mirror damping is much smaller than @xmath131 .",
