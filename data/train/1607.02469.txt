    "+ different classes of inflationary models produce wildly varying predictions for observables with some models being ruled out by recent advances in the precision of cosmic microwave background observations . the planck 2015 results  @xcite found the following value for the spectral index of the curvature perturbation , @xmath0 , and the following upper bound on the ratio of the power spectra of the tensor to scalar perturbations , @xmath1 : @xmath2 at 1-@xmath3 with negligible tensors and @xmath4 .",
    "these ( and the fact that non - gaussian and isocurvature perturbations have not been observed ) strongly suggest that primordial inflation is single - field with a concave scalar potential featuring an inflationary plateau .    indeed , while the minimal versions of chaotic and hybrid inflation are all but ruled out ( but see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , models with such an inflationary plateau ( e.g. starobinsky @xmath5 inflation @xcite , or higgs inflation @xcite ) have received enormous attention . in these models",
    "( and similar other such models , e.g. @xmath6-attractors @xcite ) , the approach to the inflationary plateau is exponential . in this case , however , distinguishing between models is difficult @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a power - law inflationary plateau was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where shaft inflation was introduced , based in global supersymmetry with a deceptively simple but highly non - perturbative superpotential , where @xmath7 is a mass scale .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a new family of single - field inflationary models , which feature a power - law approach to the inflationary plateau but are not based on an exotic superpotential like in shaft inflation .",
    "we call this family of models power - law plateau inflation .",
    "power - law plateau inflation is characterised by a simple two - mass - scale potential , which , for large values of the inflaton field , features the inflationary plateau but for small values , after the end of inflation , the potential is approximately monomial .",
    "the family is parameterised by two real parameters , whose optimal values are determined by contrasting the model with observations .",
    "we find that the predicted spectral index of the curvature perturbation is near the sweet spot of the planck observations . for a sub - planckian inflaton",
    ", the lyth bound does not allow for a large value of the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath1 .",
    "however , for mildly super - planckian inflaton values we obtain sizeable @xmath1 , which is easily testable in the near future .    even though our treatment is phenomenological , and the form of the potential of power - law plateau inflation is data driven , we develop a simple toy model in global and local supersymmetry to demonstrate how power - law plateau inflation may well be realised in the context of fundamental theory .",
    "we use natural units , where @xmath8 and newton s gravitational constant is @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the reduced planck mass .",
    "+ we start from the following proposed potential :    @xmath11    where @xmath7 is a mass scale , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real parameters and @xmath14 is a canonically normalised , real scalar field .",
    "@xmath15 is a constant density scale and we assume @xmath16 because otherwise our model is indistinguishable from monomial inflation with @xmath17 , which is disfavoured by observations .",
    "initially we impose sub - planckian values of @xmath14 to compare with perturbative models and avoid supergravity ( sugra ) corrections .    for the slow roll parameters , to first order in @xmath18 ,",
    "we find : @xmath19\\ , , \\label{eq : firstorderepsiloncontainingphi}\\ ] ] @xmath20\\ , , \\label{eq : firstorderetacontainingphi}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the scalar field and the second term in the square brackets is the first order correction .",

    ", we consider only global supersymmetry ( susy ) and sub - planckian fields .",

    "rotating the fields in configuration space ( assuming a suitable r - symmetry ) we can introduce a canonically normalised , real scalar field @xmath14 such that .",
    "then the scalar potential becomes @xmath44 we consider that there is also a d - term contribution to the scalar potential . mirroring ref .",
    "@xcite , we take @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scale of a grand unified theory ( gut ) . thus , in total , the scalar potential reads @xmath47 minimising the potential in the @xmath48 direction requires @xmath49 inserting the above in eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 which is the @xmath40 , @xmath35 power - law plateau inflation model .      to confine ourselves in global susy we have to require that .",
    "given that , the available parameter space is not a lot .",
    "however , generalising the above into sugra may allow super - planckian values for the inflaton , while @xmath51 . in sugra",
    ", we continue to consider the superpotential in eq . and we will also consider a minimal khler potential @xmath52 then the f - term scalar potential is @xmath53.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering that @xmath54 is sub - planckian , since , we have @xmath55.\\ ] ] again , the potential is minimised when . writing , we obtain @xmath56 we consider the same d - term contribution to the scalar potential , given in eq .  .",
    "the total scalar potential is now @xmath57 minimising the above along the @xmath48 direction , we find @xmath58 inserting this into eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath59 our finding is technically different from eq .   because of the exponential factor in the first term in the denominator . however , this term is important only when , when the exponential is unity . in the opposite case , when , the first term in the denominator is negligible .",
    "so the exponential factor makes no difference and the potential is practically the same with the one in eq .  .",
    "this is certainly so if the inflaton remains sub - planckian ( i.e. when @xmath60 ) .    using the potential in eq .",
    "it can be checked that the @xmath28-problem of sugra inflation is overcome due to the d - term .",
    "in fact , one can show that when .",
    "however , for a super - planckian inflaton , things are different from power - law plateau inflation , since the sugra correction dominates .",
    "so , our sugra toy model is similar but not identical to the the @xmath40 , @xmath35 power - law plateau inflation model .",

    "then the spectral index is @xmath62.\\ ] ] taking @xmath63 and @xmath64 simplifies the above considerably as @xmath65 and it is evident that as already mentioned . in this limit ,",
    "it is easy to find @xmath66 where we have taken .",
    "then , the observables become @xmath67 these should be contrasted with the predictions of power - law plateau inflation given by eqs .   and .",
    "at lowest order and taking we find @xmath68 we see that the predictions of our sugra toy - model are more pronounced with respect to @xmath29 , with both the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio smaller . also , the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath6 is more prominent in the case of power - law plateau inflation . for more realistic values of the inflaton ,",
    "however , where ( i.e. ) we would expect @xmath0 and @xmath1 to lie inbetween the above extremes",
    ". note that the predicted values are well in agreement with the planck data , in all cases .",
    "we have studied in detail a new family of inflationary models called power - law plateau inflation .",
    "the models feature an inflationary plateau , which is approached in a power - law manner , in contrast to the popular starobinsky / higgs inflation models ( and their variants ) but similarly to shaft inflation .",
    "we have shown that power - law plateau inflation is in excellent agreement with planck observations .    to avoid supergravity corrections we mostly considered a sub - planckian excursion for the inflaton in field space . as expected",
    ", this resulted in very small values for the ratio of the spectra of tensor to scalar curvature perturbation @xmath1 . in an attempt to improve our results and produce observable @xmath1",
    "we have considered minimising the remaining number of e - folds of primordial inflation when the cosmological scales exit the horizon . to this end , we assumed late reheating as well as a subsequent period of thermal inflation , driven by a suitable flaton field .",
    "we have managed to achieve which might be observable in the future ( see table  [ tab : running2 ] ) .    for economy",
    "we have also investigated the possibility that our model is characterised by a single mass scale .",
    "we have found that the spectral index of the scalar curvature perturbation @xmath0 satisfies well the planck observations but the model produces unobservable @xmath1 .    abandoning sub - planckian requirements allows the model to achieve much larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , for natural values of the mass scales ( planck and gut scale ) , i.e. without fine - tuning , we easily obtain @xmath1 as large as a few percent ( up to 9% , see table  [ tab : maximising r ] ) , which is testable in the near future .",
    "our predicted values for @xmath1 and @xmath0 fall comfortably within the 1-@xmath3 bounds of the planck observations , while different models of the power - law plateau inflation family are clearly distinguishable by future observations ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ourresultsonplanck ] and [ fig : ourresultsonplanck2 ] ) .    from our analysis",
    ", we have found that the best choice of model in the power - law plateau inflation family has the scalar potential , which is also a member of the shaft inflation family of models @xcite .",
    "such a potential was originally introduced by s - dual inflation in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , however , the inflaton was non - canonically normalised so the predicted value for @xmath0 was too large and incompatible with the planck data . following ref .",
    "@xcite but crucially considering canonically normalised fields ( i.e. minimal khler potential ) we have constructed a toy - model realisation in global and local supersymmetry for our preferred power - law plateau inflation model .",
    "all in all , the level of success of power - law plateau inflation , and the fact that it offers distinct and testable predictions make this a worthy candidate for primordial inflation , which may well be accommodated in a suitable theoretical framework , as our toy models suggest .",
