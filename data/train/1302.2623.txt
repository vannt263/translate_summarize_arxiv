    "lyman @xmath0 emitting halos around qsos are a well documented and theoretically expected ( e.g. , haiman & rees 2001 ) consequence of the enhanced ionization of the surrounding gas by the central agn . in contrast , the impact of agn on star - formation in the qso host galaxy or its satellite galaxies is more complex and subject to ongoing debate .",
    "most recently , the study of agn feedback has focused on the quenching of star formation ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; schawinsky et al 2009 ; farrah et al 2012 ; maiolino et a 2012 ) .",
    "however , considerable observational evidence ( e.g. , van breugel et al 1985 ; mccarthy et al 1987 ; chambers , miley & van breugel 1987 , dey et al 1997 , croft et al 2006 ) and theoretical arguments ( e.g. , de young 1981,1989 , rees 1989 ; begelman & cioffi 1989 ; mellema , kurk & rttgering 2002 , fragile et al 2004 , silk 2005 ) suggest that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can also induce the formation of stars in their host galaxies .",
    "the influence of the agn may extend beyond mere enhancement of the star formation rate and create peculiar stellar morphologies ( e.g. , gaibler et al 2012 ) , perhaps even in satellites of the host galaxy ( e.g. , efremov 2012 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we report the discovery , in a deep spectroscopic search for extended ly@xmath0 emission , of an extended asymmetric ly@xmath0 halo around the z=3.045 obscured qso j033238.76 - 275121.6 .",
    "inspection of existing hst / acs images shows spatial structure in the halo s ly@xmath0 profile coinciding in projection along the slit with a peculiarly shaped , double - lobed galaxy .",
    "although the redshift of the galaxy is uncertain , we present arguments that suggest the galaxy may be at the redshift of the qso . we show that this would require a very young stellar population , the age of which would be unlikely to be synchronized with the short - lived agn activity if there were no causal connection between the two , possibly in the form of qso feedback triggering the formation of the stars in the external galaxy",
    ". this scenario may also provide a plausible resolution to the problem posed by the divergent photometric redshifts suggested in the literature for the galaxy .",

    "the slit happened to intersect at least partly the object known as goods j033238.76 - 275121.6 ( giavalisco et al 2004 ) or combo-17 26280 ( wolf et al 2001 ) , which has an absorption - corrected , rest - frame x - ray ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) luminosity of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( xue et al 2011 ) . taken together with its hardness ratio and red optical colors this suggests classification as a type 2 agn or obscured , borderline qso ( e.g. , szokoly et al 2004 ; padovani et al 2004 ) .",
    "a range of redshift estimates exist in the literature ( see table 1 ) , including a spectroscopic redshift of z=3.951 ( vanzella et 2010 ) . in our spectrum",
    "the qso has a spatially asymmetric ly@xmath0 emission line peaking near 4920  , or at a redshift of 3.049 .",
    "the presence and wavelength position of faint civ emission suggests a redshift 3.045 , which is lower by about 300 kms@xmath3 . lacking a good estimator of the systemic redshift we adopt the civ redshift z=3.045 ( as the relation between the ly@xmath0 position and the systemic redshift is probably even more complicated ) .",
    "the precise redshift is immaterial for the main arguments in this paper . at this redshift ,",
    "the relative faintness in the observed b band ( b - v=1.41 ) , aside from a smaller correction by a factor 0.8 for absorption by the lyman @xmath0 forest , would be mainly due to reddening , consistent with a moderate amount of intrinsic extinction ( @xmath4 ) in the qso s _ rest frame _ v band . with our new , lower redshift ,",
    "the flux measured for this object by vanzella et al ( 2010 ) in a filter designed to capture escaping lyman continuum radiation at @xmath5 would be explained by an overlap of the filter band with the qso s ( less strongly absorbed ) non - ionizing continuum .    even though the existing photometry shows the qso to have a v band magnitude of 26.31 ( giavalisco et al 2004 ) , the continuum of the object is barely visible in our spectrum , suggesting that much of the light from the qso may not have gone through the 2 \" wide slit .",
    "the spectral profile of the ly@xmath0 emission line peak is asymmetric , with a red shoulder , a steep drop going blueward , and some faint emission at the bluest end ( fig.[speccontour ] ) .",
    "the total flux transmitted through the slit is @xmath6 erg @xmath7s@xmath3 .",
    "the emission line is spatially asymmetric as well , with the flux extending further out to the n ( top in fig .",
    "[ speccontour ] ) .",
    "the lowest discernible flux density contour in the 2-d spectrum ( fig.[speccontour ] ) , at @xmath8 erg @xmath7s@xmath3@xmath3 , extends out to about 17 proper kpc , encompassing two faint point - like emission peaks shown as `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' in fig .",
    "[ specplusim ] , with individual ly@xmath0 fluxes @xmath9 erg @xmath7s@xmath3 and @xmath10 erg @xmath7s@xmath3 , i.e. , 3.5 and 5.2 @xmath11 detections , respectively .",
    "these faint features can still be discerned separately in the two subsets of data obtained in 2008 and 2009 , suggesting that they are not noise artifacts . removing the smooth , diffuse",
    "halo with a template determined from the spatial profile redward of the two features reveals them as the only significant remaining features in the spectral range shown ( central panel in fig .",
    "[ specplusim ] ) .",
    "the separation in wavelength space between 1 and 2 amounts to about 290 kms@xmath3 , and they straddle the adopted `` systemic '' redshift for the qso ( vertical line in left panel of fig . [ specplusim ] ) . a comparison with the publicly available goods - s acs f606w cutout images ( giavalisco et al 2004 ; fig .",
    "[ specplusim ] , right panel ) shows , in addition to the image of the qso ( `` a '' ) , two faint continuum emitters ( `` b '' and `` c '' ) at approximately the same n - s angular distance @xmath12 from a ( @xmath13 `` ; @xmath14 '' ) that separates the objects 1 and 2 from the continuum trace of the qso ( ( @xmath15 ) `` and ( @xmath16 ) '' , respectively , left panel ) .",
    "objects b and c form an apparently dumbbell - shaped structure in the acs images . with similar broad band magnitudes in several optical filters ,",
    "they may in fact be one , spatially coherent object",
    ". we shall refer to them as a single structure in what follows but can not rule out from the existing observations that they are two separate galaxies .",
    "the close alignment of the b&c continuum emission in projection with the faint ly@xmath0 emission 1 and 2 in the 2-d spectrum may suggest a common origin in the same object .",
    "however , the two photometric redshifts for b&c do not agree with the spectroscopic redshift of the ly@xmath0 patches ( and of the qso ; see table 1 ) , nor do they agree among themselves .",
    "possible explanations for the discrepancy include the faintness of the object , the difficulty of spatially resolving the contributions from qso and galaxy in ground - based observations , variable amounts of ly@xmath0 emission in the broad bands , and possibly the absence of templates from the photometric redshift determinations representing what may be an unusual stellar population .",
    "in particular , the relatively blue colours of the object would be naturally explained by the properties of a very young / peculiar stellar population at redshift 3.045 , as described below .",
    "the photometry publicly available for constraining the rest - frame uv colours of the b&c object(s ) includes hst acs bands from original goods photometry by giavalisco et al ( 2004 ) , ground - based vlt - vimos photometry of grazian et al ( 2006 ) , and two additional ground - based u band observations from the eso wfi ( the so - called u35 and u38 bands ) , which were combined into single publicly available images by the gabods group ( hildebrandt et al 2006 ) .",
    "cardamone et al ( 2010 ) have measured u band fluxes for those images and included them in their catalogue .",
    "although the ground - based wfi images are noisy , these bands are situated close in wavelength to the lyman limit of the ly@xmath0 halo and can at least in principle constrain the redshift of the b&c system . for our analysis below",
    "we adopt these values in addition to the vimos u band and the acs images .    for the galaxy to be at the redshift of the qso",
    ", the steepness of the spectrum , even in the non - ionizing continuum , would require the spectrum to be dominated by young stars .",
    "the qso could boost the continuum emitted by the galaxy below the lyman limit when part of the qso s ionizing radiation is `` reflected '' by neutral hydrogen surrounding the galaxy , but the flux of the qso seems to fall short by considerable amounts for this to work . moreover , unless the gas is optically thin , the effect would also produce a reflected , proportional 2-photon continuum redward of ly@xmath0 that would tend to flatten the continuum slope .",
    "we thus attempted to fit the broad - band optical measurements of objects b&c with a young starburst spectrum at the redshift of the qso , using the library of starburst99 models ( leitherer et al 1999 ) .",
    "absorption by the ly@xmath0 forest was taken into account by using the `` mc - kim '' transmission of bershady et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "an instantaneous starburst with the starburst99 default standard initial mass function ( imf ) , an age of @xmath17 years , and a total stellar mass of @xmath18m@xmath19 fits the observed sed with a @xmath20 corresponding to an 11% probability ( with the total flux being the only free parameter ) .",
    "more extreme stellar populations can in principle improve the fit further .",
    "choosing an extreme imf that is flat or consists of only massive stars @xmath21 and an age of the burst of only @xmath22 years would increase the flux near the lyman limit further and produce a @xmath20 probability of about 30% , but may not be warranted on physical grounds .",
    "fig.[fluxmodel ] shows a comparison between the observed fluxes and the best - fit model spectrum . for illustrative purposes",
    ", the dashed - dotted line also shows a flat ( in @xmath23 ) spectrum at lower redshift ( z=2.310 ) ( ignoring ly@xmath0 forest absorption ) , as if the object were at the photometric redshift derived by cardamone et al ( 2010 ) . from this comparison",
    "it is not surprising that a large uncertainty in the u - band flux , with filters straddling the lyman limit , can lead to a degeneracy in redshift .",
    "we conclude that the observations of the b&c object are consistent with it being a galaxy at the redshift of the qso if we assume the presence of a very young population of stars .",
    "we do not know the lifetime of the qso , but can estimate crudely the possibility of finding two `` young objects '' ( the qso , and object b&c ) as close together as observed .",
    "the probability distribution of a chance coincidence of a second object with a magnitude @xmath24 and a @xmath25 ( as observed for b&c ) to occur near a similarly `` blue '' pre - selected object , estimated from random draws from the giavalisco et al ( 2004 ) galaxy catalogue , makes the present arrangement approximately a 3.4 @xmath11 excursion .",
    "more severe upper limits on the chance probability of finding a ( short - lived ) agn and a short - lived population of young stars can be derived from the respective duty cycles . assuming a duty cycle of a few percent for qsos ( yu & tremaine 2002 ; nandra et al 2002 ) and @xmath26 for starbursts in dwarf galaxies ( lee et al 2009 ) , gives a sub - percent probability for finding both in the active stage .",
    "thus , if the galaxy indeed has a young stellar population , its formation must be closely coeval with the qso activity .",
    "producing the observed ly@xmath0 fluxes in the features 1 and 2 outside the main qso emission line through recombination following photoionization requires an ionization rate @xmath27 where a case b conversion from ionizing photons into ly@xmath0 photons has been assumed , and the combined ly@xmath0 flux @xmath28 of objects 1 and 2 is @xmath29 erg @xmath7s@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath30 is the luminosity distance at z=3.045 .",
    "the stellar population of object b&c , at a magnitude @xmath31 = 26.6 in the observed v band , produces hi ionizing photons at a rate of approximately @xmath32 s@xmath3 ( using the assumptions made in paper i ) .",
    "thus , the supply of ionizing photons , if completely trapped in the gaseous halos of b&c and converted into ly@xmath0 as assumed above , would exceed the number of ionizations required to explain the observed ly@xmath0 emission by a comfortable factor 13 ( ignoring slit losses for ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "alternatively , the ly@xmath0 emission from objects 1 and 2 could , in principle , also be powered by the qso . the spatially extended , diffuse ly@xmath0 emission centered on the qso extends more than half the distance between the qso and objects 1 and 2 at a similar surface brightness level .",
    "this suggests that the ionizing flux from the qso is at least in some directions of the same order of magnitude as required to power the ly@xmath0 emission of objects 1 and 2 .",
    "the asymmetric extent of the ly@xmath0 halo is common for `` fuzz '' around qsos ( e.g. , christensen et al 2006 ) , presumably reflecting the tilt of the ionization cone away from the line of sight to the observer .",
    "we have argued that the extension of the halo in the direction of the b&c object and the alignment of the spatial substructure in the ly@xmath0 emission with the broad - band imaging positions of the galaxy suggest a physical proximity and possible causal connection between the qso and the object .",
    "coeval activity is further suggested by the coincidence between apparently recent star formation and the active state of the qso .",
    "the similarity of the lobes of b & c in brightness and colours suggests that they may constitute a single coherent galaxy , with the velocity difference of 290 kms@xmath3 perhaps being due to rotation .",
    "the appearance of two spatially distinct ly@xmath0 emission regions for this object as opposed to a common halo may simply reflect the two discrete stellar regions .",
    "alternatively , the separate ly@xmath0 peaks may be caused when the ly@xmath0 emission gets suppressed in the center of the b&c structure either by the qso physically expelling the gas , or by largely ionizing it . in either case",
    ", any further ionizing radiation may just pass through the cleared patch and not be available for conversion to ly@xmath0 . as for the hole in the stellar population ,",
    "it is not clear how this could be produced after the stars are already in place , but it does appear more likely that the qso may determine in the first place where the stars are going to form ( and where not ) . if feedback from the qso is influencing the properties of this object , then the fact that the structure is largely symmetric must either be a fortunate coincidence ( e.g. , a chance alignment with whatever symmetry the qso feedback mechanism possesses ; such as a jet that just happens to hit the galaxy at the right spot ) , or the structure with its stars and gas distribution must be formed as a direct result of the qso feedback . in the latter case ,",
    "the star - formation geometry naturally reflects the directional symmetry of the feedback .",
    "such a possibility has been suggested in the literature ( see introduction ) , both to explain the observational alignments of star - forming regions and outflows from radiogalaxies , and as a theoretically predicted consequence of agn feedback .",
    "it appears that the current case may be a high - redshift candidate case for agn - induced star - formation in an external galaxy .",
    "this interpretation , if confirmed , would be consistent with the idea discussed in papers i and ii , that asymmetric , extended ly@xmath0 emitters trace a crucial phase in the galaxy formation process , where interactions among the building blocks of future normal galaxies influence the gas dynamics , star formation process , and production of ionizing radiation in these objects .",
