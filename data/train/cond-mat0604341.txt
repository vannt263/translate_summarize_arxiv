    "correlated pairs of electrons can be manipulated in solid state devices by extracting andreev pairs from a conventional superconductor , being a condensate of cooper pairs .",
    "this process is known as andreev reflection @xcite at a normal metal / superconductor ( ns ) interface .",
    "one considers the future realization of devices designed for manipulating separately one of the two electrons of an andreev pair and see the feedback on the other electron @xcite .",
    "the question arises of exploring experimentally and understanding theoretically the properties of the simplest of these devices : a source of spatially separated andreev pairs propagating in different electrodes forming , in short , `` non local '' andreev pairs .",
    "the possibility of realizing a source of non local andreev pairs has indeed aroused a considerable interest recently , both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite .    in a theoretical prediction",
    "prior to the experiments @xcite , falci _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have obtained from lowest order perturbation theory in the tunnel amplitudes a vanishingly small non local signal with normal metals .",
    "_ @xcite have obtained on the contrary a sizeable experimental non local signal in a three terminal structure consisting of a normal metal / insulator / superconductor / insulator / normal metal ( nisin ) trilayer .",
    "the goal of our article is to provide a theory that , together with ref .  , contributes to the understanding of this experiment @xcite , as well as related possible future experiments on non local conductance fluctuations , and",

    "et al . _ with ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "falci _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have discussed the two competing channels contributing to non local transport .",
    "an incoming electron in electrode `` b '' can be transmitted as an electron in electrode `` a '' , corresponding to normal transmission in the electron - electron channel ( see the device on fig .  [",
    "fig : trilayer ] for the labels `` a '' and `` b '' ) .",
    "conversely , it can be transmitted as a hole in electrode `` a '' while a cooper pair is transfered in the superconductor .",
    "the later transmission in the electron - hole channel corresponds to a dominant `` non local '' andreev reflection channel that can lead to spatially separated , spin entangled pairs of electrons .",
    "the outgoing particles in the two transmission channels have an opposite charge , resulting in a different sign in the contribution to the current in electrode `` a '' . with normal metals , not only",
    "have the elastic cotunneling and crossed andreev reflection an opposite sign in the non local conductance , but they are exactly opposite within lowest order perturbation theory in the tunnel amplitudes .",
    "it was already established that non local transport is dominated by elastic cotunneling for localized interfaces @xcite .",
    "the superconductor can essentially be replaced by an insulator for a very thin superconductor connected by tunnel contacts to a normal metal ( assuming that the superconductor can still be described by bcs theory ) .",
    "we show that this picture breaks down if the superconductor thickness is larger than the coherence length because transport is mediated by composite objects made of evanescent quasiparticles and pairs in the condensate .    on the other hand , we find that small area junctions are controlled by a different physics with fluctuations of the non local conductance .",
    "we find on the basis of an evaluation of the diffuson in a superconductor , that the thouless energy is inverse proportional to the system size , which matches our numerical simulations .",
