    "while adiabatic pumping is very well studied@xcite , the description of non - adiabatic effects remains challenging . in view of the experimental developments towards higher frequencies ,",
    "this regime becomes increasingly relevant@xcite .",
    "moreover , non - adiabatic driving can lead to interesting effects@xcite , like the possibility to reverse the pumping current by sweeping the driving frequency@xcite . in order to exploit such effects",
    "a better understanding of the fcs for fast pumping is necessary .    in this article",
    "we consider an electron pump modeled by a single - level quantum dot at zero bias .",
    "based on the formalism given before@xcite we calculate the cumulant generating function at zero temperature and for arbitrary driving schemes .",
    "we show that in the adiabatic regime , the probability distribution for pumping electrons is always binomial , which implies that the pumping is unidirectional . in the non - adiabatic regime",
    "we obtain a trinomial distribution , which also explains the occurrence of the current reversal@xcite .",

    "it follows that the average charge and noise per period are    [ eq : trinomial ] @xmath76    for @xmath77 one finds that the pumped charge vanishes @xmath78 , while the noise remains finite @xmath79 for @xmath80 . at the vicinity of this point one obtains a current reversal@xcite .    in the opposite limit , @xmath81 , where the energy level is nearly empty during one cycle",

    "equation describes in general a complicated probability distribution .",
    "however , if one barrier is dominating the charging and the other one dominates the de - charging , one obtains a binomial distribution for a half - charge transfer . for example , if @xmath85 one gets @xmath86 this `` fractional '' behavior has been discussed previously in the context of a nano - electromechanical charge shuttle@xcite .",
    "it reflects the fact that the cycles are no longer independent of each other . for many counting cycles ,",
    "however , the behavior can effectively be described by the independent transfer of fractional charges . for later reference",
    "we note that the charge per cycle can be obtained from eq .",
    "to read @xmath87      at low frequencies , it is sufficient to consider the instantaneous contribution from eqs .",
    ", as done similarly before@xcite .",
    "consequently , the time - derivatives are set to zero and one obtains @xmath88 the instantaneous current and noise become @xmath89 not surprisingly , the current is zero , since the level is at all times in equilibrium with the reservoirs .",
    "the noise is nonzero and is called equilibrium , or nyquist - johnson noise @xcite .",
    "it is caused by the statistical nature of the electron occupation in the reservoirs characterized by the fermi distribution .",
    "using the property @xmath90 the expression for the noise becomes @xmath91 the noise per period is obtained from integrating over one period , @xmath92^{-1}[\\partial f(\\tau)/\\partial \\tau]}{1/\\gamma_{\\rm l}(\\tau)+1/\\gamma_{\\rm r}(\\tau ) } \\label{eq : thermal_noise}\\ ] ] the integral gives a value , which is independent of @xmath18 but depends on the details of the external driving , i.e. , the time - dependent level and tunneling rates .",
    "consequently , the noise per period will be proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "and fluctuations @xmath94 as a function of phase delay @xmath95 and driving frequency @xmath18 as obtained with the set of eqs. for the time dependence of quantum - dot level @xmath96 and couplings @xmath97 given in eqs .. ]    we study the first two cycle - averaged moments of the fcs : the charge @xmath98 and its fluctuations @xmath94 for an electron pump which shows current reversal and rectification effect in the non - adiabatic regime@xcite .",

    "they allow for the exponential dependence of tunneling rates due to oscillatory gate - voltages as used in experiments@xcite .",
    "the pumping is characterized by two parameters , the driving frequency @xmath18 and the time or phase delay @xmath95 of the left barrier with respect to the right one .",
    "the latter one is locked to the level @xmath96 which oscillates around the fermi energy of both reservoirs @xmath103 .",
    "if not specified differently , the temperature in the contacts is @xmath104 .",
    "figure  [ fig : charg - fluc - contour ] gives an overview of the results .",
    "we have varied the frequency @xmath18 in a rather large range ( 10@xmath105  10@xmath106 ) in order to cover the asymptotic adiabatic and non - adiabatic behavior for low and high frequencies , respectively .",
    "one can clearly see ( fig.[fig : charg - fluc - contour]a ) that the direction of the charge transport does not only depend on the phase delay @xmath95 which controls the oscillation of the left barrier with respect to the right one .",
    "rather the frequency @xmath18 is equally important and may be used to cause a current reversal as was discussed in detail before @xcite .",
    "the charge fluctuations ( fig.[fig : charg - fluc - contour]b ) show a similar pattern as the average charge , albeit somehow inverted .",
    "not surprisingly they vanish ( white areas in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - contour]b ) , when the charge transport is _ quantized _ either to the left ( blue areas marked with @xmath107 in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - contour]a ) or to the right ( red areas marked with @xmath108 in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - contour]a ) direction . in regions , however , where this is not the case the fluctuations are finite , reaching sometimes a value of @xmath109 .",
    "one maybe tempted to explain the charge fluctuations with the well - known expression @xcite @xmath110 with @xmath111 the probability to transfer one charge per cycle .",
    "it is @xmath112 with @xmath113 defined in eq .. as we will see this binomial description is only applicable for finite values of @xmath98 .",
    "it fails in regions where the current changes direction , i.e. , where @xmath114 .",
    "there are two exceptions where @xmath98 and @xmath94 vanishes simultaneously .",
    "one is the region marked with @xmath115 in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - contour ] and the other one is the high - frequency regime where @xmath116 .",
    "we will discuss all regions in the following . to be more quantitative we have plotted the charge fluctuations for selected phase delays of @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays ] .        for @xmath117 there is a current reversal at @xmath120 ( cf .",
    "inset in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays]a ) . along with the result from the rate equations ( fig.[fig : charg - fluc - contour ] and thick gray line in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays ] )",
    "we show the binomial expression and the trinomial expression from eq.([eq : trinomial]b ) .",
    "the values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the latter case have been calculated numerically .",
    "note that this is an approximation since we have assumed @xmath123 in defining @xmath113 .",
    "both shot - noise models agree qualitatively with the numerical result .",
    "however , at the current reversal ( @xmath114 ) charge fluctuations @xmath94 are on the order of @xmath124 , i.e. , they do not vanish as predicted by eq .. the trinomial description ( [ eq : trinomial]b ) captures this behavior even quantitatively as fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays]a shows .",
    "thus , the fluctuations reveal that the vanishing net transfer is not due to the fact that there is no transfer at all .",
    "rather transfer to the right and to the left do cancel each other exactly .",
    "the discrepancy between binomial and trinomial description becomes even more obvious for @xmath118 which is shown in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays]b . due to symmetry ( @xmath125 ) the charge @xmath98 vanishes for all frequencies @xmath18 and so does the binomial expression .",
    "in contrast , the trinomial expression , which simplifies to @xmath126 , describes the fluctuations for all frequencies even quantitatively .",
    "compared to the frequency - driven current reversal in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays]a the fluctuations are even larger here .",
    "the case @xmath119 , shown in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays]c , is characterized by a quantized and thus fluctuation - free transfer over a wide range of frequencies ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "it remains to discuss the case where @xmath98 and @xmath94 vanish simultaneously . for large frequencies",
    "this is rather obvious , @xmath121 and @xmath122 become small for @xmath116 since the transfer to either side can be neglected .",
    "it is less clear for the region marked with @xmath115 .",
    "it can be traced back to the coupling to right contact : both @xmath62 and @xmath65 , as defined in eq.([eq : acdbcd - matrix]b ) , do vanish .",
    "if the level can neither be charged from the right ( @xmath62 ) nor de - charged to the right ( @xmath65 ) the probabilities of transfer from ( @xmath121 ) and to ( @xmath122 ) the right contact do vanish as well .",
    "careful inspection shows that for all three cases the fluctuations increase above the values predicted by the two shot - noise models .",
    "the reason is that thermal or nyquist - johnson noise @xmath128 starts to become larger than the shot noise .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays - logarithmic ] where thermal contribution according to eq .",
    "is shown separately with dashed lines .",
    "clearly this occurs for larger temperatures @xmath129 at higher frequencies @xmath18 .",
    "the frequency , at which this takeover occurs , depends on the phase delay @xmath95 , as the three panels of fig.[fig : charg - fluc - delays - logarithmic ] show .",
    "taking , instead of ( [ eq : system]b ) and ( [ eq : system]c ) , @xmath130 yields a harmonic variation of the coupling rates , which is frequently used for modeling electron pumps .",
    "the same setup has been investigated in view of a current reversal before@xcite . using the same approach as in the last section",
    ", we calculate @xmath98 and @xmath94 for @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the results for a temperature of @xmath134 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : harm - charg - fluc - delays ] .    in all three cases , the fluctuations obtained from the trinomial probability distribution agree very well with the results of the rate equations . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig : charg - fluc - delays ] one sees that the results are qualitatively similar for @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in the latter case and for harmonic modulation",
    "the fluctuations do not become zero in the adiabatic regime since the pumped charge is not quantized ( cf .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : harm - charg - fluc - delays]c ) in contrast to the exponential driving ( cf .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : charg - fluc - delays]c ) .",
    "the biggest qualitative difference is observed for @xmath137 . for harmonic modulation",
    "the charge fluctuations display a single maximum , which is attained in the vicinity of the current reversal .",
    "this is in contrast to the exponential modulation , where the fluctuations were found to have a minimum .",
    "this difference is connected with the behavior of the left / right probabilities @xmath113 in the vicinity of the reversal frequency @xmath138 .",
    "it turns out that the slopes have the same magnitude but different signs .",
    "the curvatures may be different .",
    "therefore we consider the following simple @xmath18-dependence @xmath139+p''_{\\rev\\pm}[\\omega{-}\\omega_\\rev]^{2}\\ ] ] with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "for such a parametrization the noise becomes up to 2nd order @xmath142[\\omega{-}\\omega_\\rev]^{2},\\ ] ] where the abbreviation @xmath143 was used .",
    "the noise has an extremum at @xmath138 , which can be a minimum or maximum depending on the relation of @xmath144 and @xmath145 . whereas in the harmonic case",
    "the curvatures of @xmath113 at @xmath138 have different signs but similar magnitudes , and thus @xmath146 , the situation in the exponential case is different .",
    "here one finds a non - linear increase / decrease of @xmath113 with @xmath147 .",
    "correspondingly , close to the reversal we observe a maximum and a minimum of @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the counting statistics for non - adiabatic pumping of electrons through a single - level quantum dot . for zero temperature",
    "we derived an analytic expression for the generating function [ eq .  ] in terms of the probabilities for charging or de - charging the level during one pump cycle . in the case",
    "where those probabilities are large ( the level is almost completely filled and emptied ) , we found a trinomial probability distribution for the charge transfer .",
    "the associated elementary processes correspond to an electron being transferred to the left reservoir , to the right reservoir or no transfer .",
    "this has the important consequence that the transferred charge per cycle can vanish while the charge fluctuations remain finite .",
    "it also shows that the current - reversal does not rely on interference effects .",
    "our findings are corroborated by numerical simulations of the first two moments @xmath98 and @xmath149 for two driving schemes ( exponential and harmonic ) . to this end",
    "we derived a set of ordinary differential equations , valid for arbitrary time - dependencies , which were solved numerically .",
    "those equations may also be used in connection with pulse - shaping techniques , which allow for optimizing the pumping accuracy@xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the driving frequency and the phase delay are important parameters , which both influence the _ statistics _ of the pumping charge .",
    "this demonstrates that the ability to control the phase delays potentially provides an additional knob to improve the performance of electron pumps ."
