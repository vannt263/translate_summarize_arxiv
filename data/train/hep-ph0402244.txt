    "skyrme s soliton picture of nucleons @xcite has been successfully extended to the case of three light flavors of quarks by directly generalizing collective - coordinate method from @xmath14 to the @xmath0 case @xcite .",
    "and there is an alternative approach that hyperons are treated as bound states of solitons and @xmath15 mesons by callan and klebanov ( ck ) @xcite .",
    "ck method was first suggested to be applicable to charmed or bottomed baryons in @xcite .",
    "and walliser @xcite extended the collective - coordinate method in the flavor @xmath0 skyrme model to the general @xmath16 case .",
    "however , because the mass of the heavy flavor quarks @xmath17 is larger than @xmath18(@xmath19 ) in contrast with that of the light flavors @xmath20 , the physical world respects the approximate light flavor @xmath0 chiral symmetry more reliably .",
    "a physical system involving both light flavors(@xmath21 ) and heavy flavors(@xmath22 ) has the heavy quark flavor symmetry and the heavy quark spin symmetry in the heavy quark limit ( @xmath23 ) , as well as the chiral symmetry for the light quark system , _",
    "i.e. _ , the dynamics of the system is unchanged under the exchange of heavy quark flavors and under arbitrary transformations on the spin of the heavy quarks . in this limit ,",
    "the spin of heavy quark @xmath24 is conserved as well as the total angular momentum @xmath25 , thus the spin of light degrees of freedom @xmath26 is also conserved .",
    "combined with these symmetries , the ck approach has been successfully extended to describe the static properties of the heavy baryons with one charm or bottom quark @xcite , and also been used to chiral @xmath0 case @xcite .",
