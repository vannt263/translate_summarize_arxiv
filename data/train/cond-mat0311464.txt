    "nematic elastomers ( nes )  @xcite are rubbery materials with the macroscopic symmetry properties of nematic liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the elastic degrees of freedom of ordinary rubber , nematic elastomers possess the internal , orientational degree of freedom of liquid crystals .",
    "since nes are amorphous solids rather than fluids , their mechanical properties differ significantly from those of standard nematic liquid crystals .",
    "the interplay between elastic and orientational degrees of freedom is responsible for several fascinating properties of nes .",
    "for example , temperature change or illumination can change the orientational order and cause the elastomer to extend or contract by several hundred percent  @xcite .",
    "nematic elastomers display a soft elasticity  @xcite characterized by vanishing shear stresses for a range of longitudinal strains applied perpendicular to the nematic direction .",
    "they exhibit an anomalous elasticity in which certain bending and shear moduli are length - scale dependent and vanish or diverge at long length - scales  @xcite .",
    "in addition to unusual static properties , nes have an intriguing dynamic mechanical behavior . early rheology experiments on liquid crystalline elastomers   found no nematic effects in nes .",
    "later , however , several experiments   observed a genuinely unconventional response to oscillatory shear .",
    "it turns out that an internal relaxation of the nematic director leads to a dynamic mechanical softening of nes .",
    "this behavior has been christened dynamic soft elasticity .",
    "it makes nes interesting for device applications in areas such as mechanical vibration damping   ( exploiting the fact that the mechanical loss is record - high over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies ) or acoustics where nes open the possibility of acoustic polarization   ( using the fact that only particular soft shears are strongly attenuated ) analogous to the optical polarization in birefringent media .",
    "the theoretical investigation of the dynamic - mechanical properties of nes was pioneered by terentjev , warner and coworkers ( tw )  .",
    "references  @xcite and   present a detailed derivation of equations governing the long - wavelength low - frequency dynamics of nes and derive their associated mode structure , which includes non - hydrodynamic , rapidly decaying modes .",
    "this derivation , which assumes a single relaxation time for the director , is based on the lagrangian approach  @xcite to the dynamics of continuum systems in which non - dissipative forces are calculated as derivatives of an energy functional and dissipative forces as derivatives of a a rayleigh dissipation function .",
    "the tw work focuses primarily on rheological response in both soft and semi - soft nes at zero wavenumber , and it neglects contributions to dynamical equations arising from the frank free energy for director distortions , which are higher order in wavenumber than those arising from network elasticity . as a result , as we shall see , the mode structure derived in refs .",
    "@xcite and misses diffusive modes along symmetry directions in soft nes .",
    "when contributions from the frank free energy are included and those from the elastic network are excluded , the tw approach reproduces the original leslie - ericksen equations @xcite of nematodynamics , excluding the rotational inertial term that is usually discarded @xcite or is missing entirely in alternative derivations @xcite of these equations .    in this paper , we will present alternative approaches to deriving the equations governing the dynamics of nes",
    ". first we will derive the exclusively hydrodynamical equations for those variables whose characteristic frequencies vanish with wavenumber .",
    "these equations , like those for the hydrodynamics of smectic @xcite and columnar @xcite liquid crystals , exclude non - hydrodynamic director modes .",
    "interestingly , the modes for soft nes predicted by these equations are identical in form to those of columnar liquid crystals @xcite with three pairs of sound modes and diffusive modes along symmetry directions where sound velocities vanish .",
    "one pair of sound modes is predominantly longitudinal with non - vanishing velocity at all angles .",
    "a second pair is predominantly transverse with a velocity that vanishes for wavevector either parallel or perpendicular to the uniaxial symmetry axis , and a third pair is completely transverse with a velocity that vanishes for wavevector parallel to the symmetry axis but is nonzero otherwise .",
    "we then derive the phenomenological equations for the slow dynamics of all displacement and director variables in nes using the poisson - bracket formalism @xcite for obtaining the dynamics of coarse - grained variables , applied so successfully to the study of dynamical critical phenomena @xcite , for deriving phenomenological equations for any set of coarse - grained variables whose dynamics is slow on a time scale set by microscopic collision times . like tw , we assume a single relaxation time for the director .",
    "we do , however , discuss how this constraint can be relaxed .",
    "when applied to fluid nematic liquid crystals , the poisson - bracket formalism is equivalent to that used by the  harvard group \" in its derivation of hydrodynamics of nematics .",
    "our dynamical equations for nes reduce to the equations of nematohydrodynamics derived by the harvard group when elastic rigidities vanish and to the purely hydrodynamics equations for nes when fast modes are removed . when contributions from the frank free energy are ignored , our equations are identical to those derived by tw .",
    "we will not discuss random stresses or inhomogeneities in this paper , though they contribute static components in light scattering experiments @xcite that may obscure the observation of the ne modes we discuss here .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ harvardbasics ] we briefly review the general poisson - bracket formalism for obtaining coarse - grained dynamics .",
    "section  [ purehydrodynamics ] focuses on the pure hydrodynamics of nes .",
    "we set up equations of motion for the momentum density and the elastic displacement .",
    "we derive the appropriate elastic energy entering these equations by integrating out the director degrees of freedom .",
    "then we compare the hydrodynamic equations to those of conventional uniaxial solids and columnar liquid crystals . after extracting the sound velocities of the modes we finally determine the full mode structure in the incompressible limit .",
    "section  [ low - frequencydynamics ] features our formulation that explicitly accounts for the dynamics of the director .",

    "stochastic dynamical equations for coarse - grained fields  @xcite can be obtained by combining the poisson - bracket formalisms of classical mechanics @xcite , which guarantees the correct reactive couplings between fields with opposite signs under time reversal , and the langevin @xcite approach to stochastic dynamics , which provides a description of dissipative processes and noise forces .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be a set of coarse - grained fields whose statistical mechanics is described by a coarse - grained hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical equations for @xmath3 are first - order differential equations in time : @xmath4 here and in the following the einstein summation convention is understood .",

    "( [ genharvard ] ) may be used to set up a dynamic functional  @xcite to study the effects of nonlinearities and fluctuations via dynamical field theory . in this paper",
    "we are not interested in these effects .",
    "hence , we focus on linearized hydrodynamic equations and pay no further attention to noise .",
    "hydrodynamics describes the dynamics of those degrees of freedom whose characteristic frequencies @xmath12 vanish as wavenumber tends to zero . in other words hydrodynamics",
    "focuses exclusively on the _ leading _ low - frequency , long - wavelength behavior .",
    "all other degrees of freedom , even though they might be slow , are strictly speaking not hydrodynamic ones . in this section",
    "we will derive the hydrodynamic equations of nes .",
    "these equations apply for frequencies @xmath12 such that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the longest non - hydrodynamic decay time in the system .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the characteristic time for director decay is in fact very slow with @xmath15 sec .   so that the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics is quite small for current nes .",
    "it is imaginable , however , that other systems will be found with shorter decay times .",
    "there are two general classes of hydrodynamic variables : conserved variables and broken symmetry variables .",
    "a single - component ne has the same set of conserved variables as a fluid : energy density @xmath16 , mass density @xmath17 , and momentum density @xmath18 .",
    "it also has the same broken symmetry variables as a crystalline solid , namely three displacement variables , though strictly speaking , these variables in an elastomer are not associated with a macroscopic broken symmetry because in the absence of orientational order elastomers have the same macroscopic rotational and translational symmetry as a fluid . since it is rotational symmetry that distinguishes a nematic elastomer from an isotropic one , it could be argued that the nematic director should be a hydrodynamic variable , but as in smectic and columnar liquid crystals , the director degrees of freedom decay in microscopic times to their preferred configuration in the presence of strain and are thus not hydrodynamic variables .",
    "elastomers differ from equilibrium crystals in at least two important ways : the first , alluded to above , is that they are not periodic and thus do not have mass - density wave order parameters whose phases act as broken symmetry hydrodynamic variables ; rather lagrangian displacement variables @xmath19 take their place .",
    "the second is that an elastomer is permanently crosslinked : it is a classical rubber in which changes @xmath20 in mass density are locked to changes in volume such that @xmath21 and in which permeation in which there is translation of a mass - density - wave without mass motion is prohibited .",
    "thus , mass density is not an independent hydrodynamic variable , and we are left with a total of @xmath22 independent variables and @xmath23 associated hydrodynamic modes .",
    "these modes are heat diffusion and , depending on direction , either six propagating sound modes , four propagating sound modes and two diffusive displacement / velocity modes , or two longitudinal sound modes and diffusive displacement / velocity modes . in what follows",
    ", we will consider only isothermal processes so that heat heat diffusion can be ignored .      to derive the hydrodynamical equations for nes",
    ", we first need the appropriate elastic free energy .",
    "the elastic constant measuring the energy of strains in planes containing the anisotropy axis [ the shear modulus @xmath24 to be defined in eq .",
    "( [ uniax ] ) ] vanishes as a result of the broken symmetry brought about by the establishment of nematic order .",
    "thus a good starting point for this free energy is that of a uniaxial solid with this elastic constant simply set to zero .",
    "this leaves certain soft directions in which distortions cost zero energy , and as in smectic and columnar liquid crystals  @xcite , curvature - like terms that are quadratic in second - order spatial derivatives have to be added to ensure stability . to make contact with dynamical equations involving the director to be presented in sec .",
    "[ low - frequencydynamics ] , rather than simply adding these terms , we find it useful to derive them from the free energy of a nematic elastomer expressed in terms of both the strain and the directors .",
    "we will restrict our attention to harmonic distortions .",
    "elastomers are permanently crosslinked pieces of rubber whose static elasticity is most easily described in lagrangian coordinates in which @xmath25 labels a mass point in the unstretched ( reference ) material and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the displacement variable , labels the position of the mass point @xmath25 in the stretched ( target ) material .",
    "we will use lagrangian coordinates throughout this paper . we will , however on occasion make reference to eulerian coordinates in which @xmath28 specifies a position in space and @xmath29 the displacement variable at that position .",
    "the elastic energy of a nematic elastomer can be divided into three parts : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the usual elastic energy of a uniaxial solid , @xmath32 is the frank free energy of a nematic , and @xmath33 is the energy of coupling between strain and director distortions .",
    "choosing the coordinate system so that the @xmath34-direction coincides with the uniaxial direction , we have to harmonic order @xcite @xmath35 here , @xmath36 are linearized components of the lagrange strain tensor @xmath37 : @xmath38 we will use the convention that indices from the beginning of the alphabet , @xmath39 , assume the values 1 and 2 whereas indices from the middle of the alphabet , @xmath40 , run from 1 to 3 . note that , compared to our work on the anomalous elasticity of nes  @xcite the elastic constants in eq .",
    "( [ uniax ] ) have a somewhat different definition that is geared towards taking the incompressible limit . here",

    "the coupling energy , finally , can be written in the form @xmath55 where once more terms beyond harmonic order have been neglected and where @xmath56    as explained above the director is not a genuine hydrodynamic variable and hence it should be integrated out of the elastic energy as long as we focus on the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "we do so by minimizing @xmath2 over @xmath50 to find @xmath57 inserting this equation into @xmath2 and retaining only the dominant terms in gradients , we obtain @xmath58 where    [ reno ] @xmath59    the superscript @xmath60 indicates that @xmath24 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 have been renormalized by director fluctuations . note that the elastic constants @xmath63 and @xmath64 are not the same as the frank splay and bend constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this is in contrast to smectic - a and columnar liquid crystals in which the coefficients of quartic gradient terms in the effective elastic energy arising from the relaxation of director modes are identical to the frank elastic constants .",
    "the modulus @xmath65 can have either sign , and there are no thermodynamic constraints preventing either @xmath66 or @xmath67 from being zero .",

    "it would be interesting to map out the modes of nematic elastomers directly using light scattering .",
    "it may , however , be difficult to access the true hydrodynamic limit because it applies in current nes only for frequencies of order 100 hz or less and because inherent sample inhomogeneities may lead to extra scattering that could mask the signals of the characteristic modes of a homogeneous system .",
