    "the significance of topological insulators ( ti ) as a new state of matter has been stressed in numerous publications.@xcite so far , the main attention has been focused on the surface states.@xcite it was pointed out recently that impurity scattering may have non - trivial effects in the _ bulk _ of ti due to its peculiar band structure.@xcite more concretely , in topological insulators with  inverted - mexican - hat \" band dispersion around the @xmath1-point , in - gap bound states occur due to impurities from which band electrons are scattered ( even with arbitrary weak scattering rate).@xcite in the case of magnetic ( anderson ) impurities ( forming localized moments ) the associated kondo physics in bulk ti is profoundly distinct from its metallic analog . using a slave - boson mean - field theory,@xcite it was shown that an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) between the spins of the anderson impurity @xmath4 and the induced mid - gap bound - state @xmath5 , leads to a self - screened kondo effect ( ke).@xcite in fact , the physics described above is not limited to ti but is a general consequence of insulators ( and semi - conductors ) with a large electronic density of states at the band edge such that in - gap bound states are easily induced by an anderson impurity .",
    "the goal of this work is to perform a detailed analysis of the interplay between the anderson impurity and its induced in - gap bound state in bulk ti , and , in particular , elucidate the observable quantities ( such as conductivity and magnetic susceptibility ) related to the underlying kondo physics . employing a weak - coupling renormalization group ( rg ) analysis , we show that the system exhibits complex crossover behavior between different symmetry sectors and that the exchange interaction @xmath6 between the @xmath4- and @xmath5-spins may be renormalized dynamically to a negative value at suitable parameters regime . in this case",
