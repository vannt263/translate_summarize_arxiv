    "there is an obvious and wide spread interest in predicting extreme events in a variety of contexts .",
    "particularly well known examples are the insurance risks related to large tropical storms , human and property risks in the context of large earthquakes , financial risks caused by large movements of the markets , and dangers to passenger planes due to extremely intermittent turbulent air velocities .",
    "obviously , any improvement in the predictability of any of these extreme events is highly desirable for a number of reasons .",
    "accordingly , there exists a large body of work focusing on the statistics of such events , small , intermediate and large , with the aim of studying the ensuing probability distribution functions ( pdf ) .",
    "if one can model properly the pdf , one can in principle predict at least the frequency of extreme events . yet",
    ", there is one fundamental question that arises that needs to be confronted first : are the extreme events sharing the same statistical properties as the small and intermediate events , or are they `` outliers '' ? if the latter is true , then no analysis of the core of the pdf , clever as it may be , could yield a proper answer to the desire to predict the probability of extreme events .",
    "indeed , in a number of context it had been proposed recently that extreme events are  outliers \" @xcite .",
    "for example in financial markets the largest draw - downs appear to exhibit properties that differ from the bulk of the fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in general one would refer to  outliers \" when the rate of occurrence of small and intermediate events lies on a pdf with some given properties , while the extreme events appear to exhibit statistical properties that differ from the bulk in a significant way .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a detailed analysis of the fluctuations in a turbulent dynamical system that shows that such a point of view can be substantiated .",
    "clearly , this type of considerations must be conducted with great care .",
    "the danger is that on small time horizons the largest events appear so rarely , once or twice , that their rate of occurrence is not statistically significant , and no conclusion about their relation to the statistics of small and intermediate events is possible .",
    "nevertheless , we offer in this paper a positive outlook .",
    "we will show that in the context of the bulk of this paper , which is the analysis of a shell model of turbulence , one can analyze _ within the short time horizon _ the dynamics of the extreme events .",
    "this analysis reveals their special dynamical scaling properties , allowing us to make interesting predictions about the tails of the distribution functions even before the full statistics is available .",
    "these predictions can be checked in our case by considering much longer time horizons .",
    "the conclusion for the extreme events community is that it may very well pay to look very carefully at the detailed dynamics of the extreme events if one wants to claim anything about their probability of occurrence .",
    "the model that we treat in detail in this paper is a so - called  shell \" model of turbulence .",
    "shell models of turbulence @xcite are simplified caricatures of the equations of fluid mechanics in wave - vector representation ; typically they exhibit anomalous scaling even though their nonlinear interactions are local in wavenumber space .",
    "the wavenumbers are represented as shells , which are chosen as a geometric progression @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the  shell spacing \" .",
    "there are @xmath2 degrees of freedom where @xmath2 is the number of shells .",
    "the model specifies the dynamics of the  velocity \" @xmath3 which is considered a complex number , @xmath4 .",
    "their main advantage is that they can be studied via fast and accurate numerical simulations , in which the values of the scaling exponents can be determined very precisely .",
    "we employ our own home - made shell model which had been christened the sabra model@xcite .",
    "it exhibits similar anomalies of the scaling exponents to those found in the previously popular goy model @xcite , but with much simpler correlation properties , and much better scaling behavior in the inertial range .",
    "the equations of motion for the sabra model read : @xmath5 where the star stands for complex conjugation , @xmath6 is a forcing term which is restricted to the first shells and @xmath7 is the  viscosity \" . in this paper",
    "we restrict the forcing to the first and and second shells only ( @xmath8 . the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 are chosen such that @xmath11 this sum rule guarantees the conservation of the  energy \" @xmath12 in the inviscid ( @xmath13 ) limit .",
    "the main attraction of this model is that it displays multiscaling in the sense that moments of the velocity depend on @xmath14 as power laws with nontrivial exponents : @xmath15 where the scaling exponents @xmath16 exhibit non linear dependence on @xmath17 .",
    "we expect such scaling laws to appear in the  inertial range \" with shell index @xmath18 larger than the largest shell index that is effected by the forcing , denoted as @xmath19 , and smaller than the shell indices affected by the viscosity , the smallest of which will be denoted as @xmath20 .",
    "the scaling exponents were determined with high numerical accuracy better than @xmath21 in ref.@xcite .    to introduce the issue behind the title of this paper , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a typical time series for @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters of the model are detailed in the figure legend .",
    "one can see the typical appearance of rare events with amplitude that exceeds the mean by a factor of 68 . to pose the question in its clearest way we display in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a distribution function which is the normalized rate of occurrence ( i.e. the number of times ) that a given amplitude has been observed in the time window of @xmath23 time steps .",
    "this apparent relative frequency of events is very similar to findings in real data , see for example fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . which deals with draw downs in the dow jones average .",
    "similarly to the analysis there , we can pass an approximate straight line through the points representing small and intermediate events .",
    "such an exponential law would mean that the events of @xmath24 with amplitudes larger than , say , 4@xmath25 are clear outliers .",
    "their probability is so low that they should not have appeared in the short time horizon at all .",
    "we could conclude , like in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the extreme events can not be dealt with the same distribution function as the small and intermediate events .",
    "-1.2 cm    on the other hand , it is very possible that the low rate of occurrence of the extreme events in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] means simply that they are statistically irrelevant and that no conclusion can be drawn . how to overcome this difficulty ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that indeed the extreme events may have dynamical scaling properties that are all their own , and that they affect crucially the tails of the distributions functions , making them very broad indeed .",
    "the main new point is that detailed analysis of the extreme events _ in the short time horizon _ suffices to make lots of predictions about the tails of the pdf s , predictions that in our case can be easily confirmed by considering much longer time horizons .    in explaining our ideas we will try to distinguish aspects which are general , and that in our view may have applications to other systems with extreme events , and aspects which are particular to the example of the shell model of turbulence .",
    "thus we start in sect.2 with an analysis of the temporal shape of the extreme events .",
    "we believe that this analysis is very general , leading to an important relation between the amplitude of the event and its time scale ( the time elapsing from rise up to demise ) . in sect .",
    "3 we employ the dynamical scaling form of the extreme events to present a theory of the tails of the distribution functions .",
    "we can relate the tails of pdf s belonging to different scales . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss numerical studies of the pdf s , distinguishing the core and the tails . in sect.5",
    "the main numerical findings are rationalized theoretically on the basis of universal  pulse \" solutions of the dynamics of the sabra model .",
    "section 6 contains the bottom line : we make use of the scaling relations to _ predict _ the tails of pdf s from data collected within short time horizons .",
    "direct measurements of these tails give nonsense unless the time horizons are increased a hundred fold . yet with the help of the theoretical forms we can offer predicted tails that agree very well with the data collected with much longer time horizons .",
    "in turbulence in general and in our shell model in particular the energy that is injected by the forcing at the largest scales ( @xmath26 and 2 ) is transferred on the average to smaller scales .",
    "it is advantageous to analyze the extreme events of a given scale ( or given shell @xmath18 ) and also to follow the cascade of extreme events from scale to scale .",
    "we first consider a given shell .",
    "we focus here on the detailed dynamics of the largest events of a given scale .",
    "we considered for example the time series of the 20th shell ( @xmath27 ) and isolated the 5 largest events ( in terms of their amplitude ) as they occurred in a time window of @xmath23 time steps . in the first step of analysis we normalized these 5 events by the amplitude at their maximum .",
    "next we plotted these normalized events as a function of time , subtracting the time at which they have reached their maximum value .",
    "the result of this replotting is shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig3 - 1 ] .",
    "obviously a similar replotting can be done for any time series , and by itself is contentless .",
    "-1.2 cm    = 8.3 cm    -0.8",
    "cm    = 8.3 cm    the next step of analysis will reveal already something interesting .",
    "building on the normalized events of fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 1 ] we attempt to rescale the time axis for each event in order to collapse the data together .",
    "of course , each event calls for a different rescaling factor , which we denote ( in frequency units ) as @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that such a rescaling factors exist , and that they leads to data collapse as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 2 ] , is a not trivial fact which may or may not exist in different cases .",
    "but we will show that if such a rescaling is found , it can serve as a starting point for very useful considerations .",
    "the third step of the present analysis is a search of meaning to the rescaling factors @xmath28 .",
    "we hope that @xmath28 has a simple relation to the amplitude of the extreme events . to test this we can plot the individual values of @xmath28 found in fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 2 ] as a function of the amplitude at the peak .",
    "the resulting plot is shown as fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 3 ] . in passing the straight line through the data points we included the point @xmath29 in the analysis , as we search for a simple scaling form @xmath30 with @xmath31 a scaling exponent .",
    "we conclude that in this case we have a satisfactory scaling law with @xmath32 .",
    "the meaning of this scaling law is quite apparent in the present case .",
    "looking back at the equation of motion we realize that from the point of view of power counting ( not to be confused with actual dynamics ) it can be written as @xmath33 with @xmath32 .",
    "it is thus acceptable that a rescaling of @xmath34 by @xmath35 should collapse all the extreme events as shown above .",
    "if the equation of motion were cubic in @xmath36 we could expect @xmath37 etc .",
    "obviously , the rescaling analysis in this case revealed the type of dynamics underlying the process . whether this can be done effectively in other case where extreme events are crucial",
    "is an open question for future research .",
    "= 8.6 cm    = 8.6 cm      to gain further understanding of the extreme events we focus now on the transfer from scale to scale .",
    "consider for example a particular large amplitude event in the shell @xmath38 , and its future fate as time proceeds .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the event reached its highest amplitude at shell 15 around @xmath39 . at a slightly later time it appeared as a large event in shell 16 , and with a shorter delay at shell 17 where it started to split into a doublet . at even shorter delays this event emerges as a triplet and a multiplet at shells 18,19 and 20 respectively .",
    "a very important characteristic of the dynamics of large events can be obtained from finding how to relate the maximal amplitudes of the first peak in the different shells . as was done above",
    ", we first replot all the first peaks as a function of time minus the time @xmath40 of their maximal amplitude @xmath41 .",

    "we have learned how to translate information from the tail of a pdf in a high shell to the tail of a pdf of a low shell . in doing",

    "we could present predicted tails that were populated only in time horizons that were a hundred fold longer than those in which the analysis was performed .",
    "we demonstrated the existence of scaling properties of the extreme events that are in distinction from the bulk of the fluctuations that make the core of the pdf . in this sense",
    "the extreme events are outliers .",
    "we can not , on the basis of the present work , claim that this approach has a general applicability to a large class of physical systems in which extreme events are important .",

    "we are pretty confident that similar ideas can ( and should ) be implemented to fluid turbulence ; whether or not such techniques will be applicable to broader issues like geophysical phenomena or financial markets is a question that we pose to the community at large .",
