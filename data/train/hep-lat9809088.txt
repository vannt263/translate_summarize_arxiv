    "matrix models allow a recursive construction of the series ; in four dimensions , though , such methods are not available , but an alternative procedure based on numerical simulations has been developed @xcite :    ( _ a _ ) using monte carlo simulations we identify all _ distinct _ triangulations , up to a given volume . to identify the triangulations , we introduce a hash function @xmath22 ; this function has to be complicated enough to distinguish between combinatorially different triangulations , while simple enough for a repeated calculation in the mc simulations",
    ".    only triangulations that can not be reduced by applying one of the volume decreasing geometric moves have to be considered in the mc .",

    "this gives the first 16 terms in the strong - coupling series , however , due to different finite - size corrections these terms split into two distinct series which have to be analyzed separately .",
    "the strong - coupling series is analyzed using an appropriate series extrapolation method , e.g.  the _ ratio method_. assuming the asymptotic behavior eq .",

    "the values of @xmath0 become unstable for small @xmath8 ; this is consistent with the fact that in the corresponding mc simulations we observe a phase transition to a crumpled phase .",
    "this transition is evident in the series extrapolation as successive approximations fail to converge both in the crumpled phase and in the critical region .    from these and further investigations",
    "we conclude that phase diagrams of the two models are quite similar , as depicted schematically in fig .  3 .",
    "in addition to the crumpled and branched polymer phases , a new _ crinkled _ phase appears , for sufficiently strong coupling to either matter or the measure term , characterized by a finite @xmath37 .    as @xmath38 ,",
