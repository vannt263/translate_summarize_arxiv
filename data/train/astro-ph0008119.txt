    "nevertheless this image still only samples about 0.1% of the total stellar content of the cluster .",
    "further progress can be expected from deeper near - infrared images that will be obtainable in the next few years with the adaptive optics systems on the keck , gemini and vlt .    the k - band surface brightness and surface density increase approximately with the inverse of the distance to about 1@xmath2 from the central compact radio source sgra@xmath0 ( see below ) .",

    "it is debatable whether this value is also a good estimate of the core radius of the overall ( old ) stellar cluster since the observed stars only sample the brighter ( and more massive ) members of the cluster , as discussed above .",
    "allen ( 1994 ) and rieke and rieke ( 1994 ) have deduced larger values of the core radius ( 0.5 to 0.8pc ) from the near - ir surface brightness distribution of the late type stars only .",

    "the sgra@xmath0 cluster may represent a central stellar ` cusp ' associated with the radio source . from an analysis of recent high resolution , near - ir data sets alexander ( 2000 , and references therein )",
    "concludes that a cusped distribution with a power law density distribution of exponent @xmath101.5 to @xmath101.75 is a better fit ( at @xmath32@xmath11 ) to the data than a distribution that has a flat central core .",
    "if this conclusion is correct , the stellar density in the sgra@xmath0 cluster may be @xmath12 or greater , compared to the 100  times lower value averaged over the central 0.4pc .",
    "one consequence then would be that the absence of bright late type giants in the innermost few arcseconds ( sellgren et al .",
    "1990 , genzel et al .",
    "1996 , haller et al .  1996 ) may be explained by envelope destruction in close impact , giant - dwarf or giant - binary collisions ( alexander 2000 , davies et al .  1998 ) .",
    "another important consequence is that with future sensitive adaptive optics and interferometric imaging ( @xmath13 ) it should be possible to detect up to 100  stars residing within 0.1@xmath2 and several stars within 0.01@xmath2 of sgra@xmath0 .",

    "krabbe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have fitted the properties of the massive early type stars in the central parsec by a model of a star formation ` burst ' between 2 and 9  million years ago in which a few hundred ob  stars and perhaps a few thousand stars in total were formed .",
    "this conclusion is in excellent agreement with earlier proposals by rieke and lebofsky ( 1982 ) , lacy , townes and hollenbach ( 1982 ) and allen and sanders ( 1986 ) . in the analysis of krabbe et al .",
    "the hei - stars are the most massive cluster members that have already evolved off the main sequence . in this scenario",
    "the central parsec is now in the late , wind - dominated phase of the burst .",
    "a similar object is the r136 star cluster powering the 30  doradus nebula in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the presence of a number of highly dust - enshrouded and spatially resolved infrared sources ( e.g.  irs1 , 3 and 21 , apparent in the upper right of fig .  3 , krabbe et al .  1995 , ott et al .  1999 ,",
    "tanner et al .  1999 ) may indicate that stars are still forming at the present time .",
    "however , the star formation activity appears to be significantly less now than during the peak of the burst .",
    "likewise the small number of red supergiants ( 1 to 3 in the central parsec , blum et al .",
    "1996a ) shows that the star formation rate prior to 10 or more million years ago also was substantially smaller . the relatively large number ( @xmath130 in central parsec , genzel et al .",

    "1996a ) and very bright red giants with luminosities @xmath18 to @xmath19l@xmath16 ( = agb stars , apparent in fig .  3 as a group to the right from the top of the giant branch )",
    "may signify other such starburst episodes that probably happened between 100 and 1000  million years ago ( haller and rieke 1989 , krabbe et al .",

    "the present gas density in the central parsec is far too low for gravitational collapse of gas clouds to stars in the presence of the strong tidal forces ( morris 1993 ) .",
    "perhaps the most recent episode of star formation was triggered by infall of a particularly dense gas cloud about 10  million years ago .",
    "this cloud may then in addition have been compressed by shocks and cloud - cloud collisions in the central parsec , thus triggering gravitational collapse .",
    "the cloud - infall model is also supported by an overall counter - rotation ( in the sense of galactic rotation ) of the hei - star cluster ( genzel et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 and below ) .",
    "another possibility is that a young star cluster came into the nuclear environment on a highly elliptical or parabolic orbit .",
    "if that star cluster was initially dense enough to have been tidally stable , it could have rapidly sunk in due to dynamical friction , followed by tidal disruption in the innermost region ( gerhard 2000 ) . as an alternative to the starburst scenario eckart et al .",
    "( 1993 ) had considered formation of massive stars by sequential merging in star - star collisions .",
    "fokker - planck modeling of an evolving galactic center type , dense cluster shows , however , that merging can account for only @xmath110 20m@xmath16 stars and no @xmath330m@xmath16 stars ( lee 1994 ) .",
    "the basic reason is that in the calculations a sufficiently dense stellar core ( density @xmath20 or greater ) can not be maintained for a long enough time to build up very many massive stars .",
    "further morris ( 1993 ) had suggested that the hei - stars are not classical blue supergiants at all but transitory objects that have been created in collisions between ( @xmath110m@xmath16 ) stellar black holes and solar mass , red giants .",
    "both accounts of the hei - stars just cited are very specific to the high density environment of the central parsec .",
    "however , the ` quintuplet ' and ` arches ' clusters several tens of parsecs north of sgra have a massive star content and evolutionary state ( including hei - stars ) remarkably similar to that of the central , high density nuclear region ( cotera et al .  1996 , figer et al .",
    "1995 , 1999a , b ) . further ott et al .  ( 1999 ) found that the hei - star irs16sw is an eclipsing binary with a minimum mass of 100  solar masses . these facts and the presence of heavy element nucleosynthesis products discussed above ( fig .",
    "2 ) strongly favor the star formation model over the other scenarios . if the galactic center is representative of other galactic nuclei as well , nuclear star formation may be a dynamic and highly time variable process that is the result of a complex interplay of the triggering effects of cloud infall and compression on the one hand , and of the destructive effects of stellar winds and supernova explosions on the other hand .",
    "figure  4 shows a k - band spectrum of the central 0.6@xmath2 centered on sgra@xmath0 , obtained with the isaac infrared spectrometer on the eso - vlt ( from eckart et al .  1999 ,",
    "see also genzel et al .",
    "1997 , figer et al .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the sgra@xmath0 cluster is blue and featureless and requires stars hotter than k - type giants . given the typical k - band magnitudes @xmath2116 ) the sgra@xmath0 cluster members thus are likely early b or late o  stars ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "an interesting new application of infrared spectroscopy is the study of element abundances in the galactic center stars . as mentioned above , the metallicity of the sgra west hii region is probably greater than solar , with a best estimate of twice solar abundances ( e.g.  shields and ferland 1994 ) .",
    "najarro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have reported that the mg- and fe - abundance in the luminous ` pistol ' blue supergiant in the quintuplet cluster is also at least twice solar .",
    "recent high resolution near - ir spectroscopy of irs7 ( fig .  5 , carr et al .",
    "2000 , ramirez et al .",
    "2000 ) and half a dozen other m - supergiants within 30pc of sgra@xmath0 , on the other hand , results in a near solar , fe - abundance .",
    "it is not clear yet whether these results are in conflict with each other , or whether the uncertainties in the analysis allow a common solution .    in summary ,",
    "the stellar and nebular observations of the central parsec are quite well described by a modest , aging starburst that currently dominates the energetics of the sgra west hii region .",
    "several puzzles remain .",
    "ob main sequence stars and early wolf - rayet stars have not yet been unambiguously observed .",
    "it is surprising that rare , short - lived stars ( such as wn9/ofpe and lbvs ) dominate the stellar census ( e.g.  tamblyn et al .",
    "quantitative estimates of the emerging ( e)uv spectral energy distribution of an evolving star cluster based on current tracks predict an overall increase of the effective temperature of the radiation field a few million years after the burst ( lutz 1999 , see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this is due to hot wn / wc  stars dominating the euv radiation field that controls the excitation of the hii region .",
    "this prediction is at odds with the observations ; they indicate that most of the energetics / excitation of the sgra hii region can be plausibly accounted for by the hei emission line cluster .",
    "it appears that the evolutionary tracks do not properly describe the stellar census in the central parsec .",
    "one issue in this context is the role of stellar rotation in the appearance and characteristics of the massive stars ( e.g.  langer and maeder 1995 , heger and langer 2000 ) .",
    "rotational mixing may bring up efficiently nucleosynthesis products into the outer atmospheres of the stars .",
    "hanson et al .  (",
    "1996 ) have proposed that the enhanced nitrogen abundances apparent in the spectra of several of the galactic center stars ( e.g.  irs13e in fig .  2 , similar to on supergiants )",
    "may be related to this effect .",
    "ever since its original discovery the compact , nonthermal radio source sgra@xmath0 at the core of the nuclear star cluster has been the primary candidate for a possible massive black hole at the galactic center , in analogy to compact nuclear radio sources in other nearby normal galaxies ( lynden - bell and rees 1971 ) .",
    "in fact ever more detailed radio measurements have confirmed the unique nature of sgra@xmath0 in the galaxy .",
    "recent very long baseline radio interferometry ( vlbi ) observations in the mm - range show its intrinsic size , after correction for interstellar scattering , to be less than about 3au ( bower and backer 1998 , lo et al .  1999 , krichbaum et al .",
    "yet sgra@xmath0 is relatively faint in any wavelength range other than the cm - mm band . using several several bright stars with radio masers in their envelopes ( present on both radio and near - infrared maps )",

    "( 1997 ) have been able to register sgra@xmath0 on near - infrared maps with an uncertainty of @xmath2230milli - arsec ( asterisk in fig .  1 ) .",

    "1997 , ghez et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the june 1996 and july 1997 ntt images ( genzel et al .  1997 ) there is a @xmath24 source at the nominal position of sgra@xmath0 , possibly implying a time variable source associated with sgra@xmath0 .",
    "alternatively one of the nearby faint stars may have moved there ( ghez et al .",
    "nevertheless it is fairly clear that sgra@xmath0 has been infrared - quiet during the past one or two decades .",
    "this limits its infrared luminosity to less than a few thousand solar luminosities .",
    "recent arcsecond - resolution observations with chandra have established that there is a ( weak ) , compact kev - source at the position of sgra@xmath0 ( baganoff et al .",
    "its luminosity in the 110kev band is less than a few l@xmath16 .",
    "observations with asca and granat suggest that sgra@xmath0 s x - ray luminosity may have been larger in the past few hundred years ( a few @xmath25l@xmath16 , koyama et al .",

    "1993 ) .",
    "if sgra@xmath0 is a black hole , it must be radiating at a surprisingly low level .",
    "the evidence for a ( dark ) central mass in the galactic center thus is based entirely on the gas and stellar dynamics . while the velocities of gas clouds and of stars are approximately constant outside of a few parsec  as expected if the mass is dominated by the dense , near - isothermal nuclear star cluster  velocities are observed to increase with a kepler law within the inner core ( e.g.  genzel and townes 1987 ) . the first evidence for this increase in gas velocities came from mid - infrared spectroscopy of the 12.8micrometer [ neii ] emission line by wollman et al .",

    "( 2000 ) also find some evidence that the fainter ` sgra@xmath0 cluster ' stars have a tendency for more radial orbits ( fig .  7 , upper right ) .",

    "if the central point mass is replaced by a compact dark cluster with a plummer density distribution , its core density must exceed @xmath31 , almost a million times denser than the visible stellar cluster , or the densest globular clusters .",
    "the plummer model also requires that such a dark cluster would have to have a very steep density distribution outside of its core radius ( @xmath32 , for @xmath33milli - parsec ) , very different from an isothermal distribution .",
    "the mass to bolometric luminosity ratio of this central dark mass thus is a few hundred ( in solar units ) or greater .",
    "simple physical considerations show that clusters of low mass stars ( e.g.  white dwarfs ) , neutron stars , stellar black holes or sub - stellar entities ( e.g.  brown dwarfs , rocks ) with the observed properties of the dark mass can not be stable for longer than @xmath34years ( maoz 1995 , 1998 , genzel et al .",
    "it is also not possible that the dark mass concentration is the very dense ( = core - collapsed ) state of a dynamically evolving cluster of above objects . in that case",
    "the distribution  while very dense in its very small core  would have a soft , quasi - isothermal envelope , unlike what is observed in the galactic center ( genzel et al .",
    "the most likely configuration of the dark galactic center mass distribution thus is a black hole .",
    "maoz ( 1998 ) points out that the only  albeit highly improbable  alternatives to a massive black hole are a concentration of heavy bosons and a compact cluster of light ( @xmath70.005m@xmath16 ) black holes .",
    "two further arguments substantially strengthen the conclusion that the dark mass in the galactic center in fact must be a massive black hole .",
    "the first comes from the fact that sgra@xmath0 itself is known from vlbi measurements to have a proper motion less than about 20km / s relative to the galactic center reference frame ( backer and sramek 1999 , reid et al .",
    "hence the two order of magnitude difference in velocities between the radio source and the nearby sgra@xmath0 cluster stars means that sgra@xmath0 must have a mass @xmath35@xmath36m@xmath16 ( reid et al .",
    "1999 ) , unless its true motion is exactly along the line of sight ( genzel et al .",
    "if one further assumes that the mass of sgra@xmath0 must be at least as concentrated as its radio emission ( 1au corresponds to 17  schwarzschild radii of a 3  million solar mass black hole ) , the inferred density of sgra@xmath0 must be @xmath3@xmath37 .",
    "the second argument is an inversion of the well known dilemma that if sgra@xmath0 is a three million solar mass black hole it is currently radiating at a rest mass energy to radiation , conversion efficiency of only @xmath38 to @xmath39 , considering the accretion of stellar wind gas from its environment ( melia 1992 , genzel et al .",
    "the only possible way for explaining this feeble emission ( other than very large time variability of the accretion ) is the argument that in purely radial ( bondi - hoyle ) or in low density , non - radial flows most of the rest mass energy of the accretion flow can be advected into the hole , rather than radiated away ( rees et al .",
    "1982 , melia 1992 , 1994 , narayan et al .  1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "this explanation , however , requires the existence of an event horizon and does not work with any configuration but a black hole ( narayan et al .",
    "taking all these arguments together it is hard to escape the conclusion that the core of the milky way in fact harbors a million solar mass , central black hole .",
    "further progress can be expected soon .",
    "the first detections of curvature in the trajectories of s1 , s2 and s8 from the keck proper motion experiment ( ghez et al .",
    "2000 ) demonstrate that sgra@xmath0 indeed is near the focus of the orbits and that fairly accurate orbits for individual stars can be determined over the next few years .",
    "further details of the mass distribution ( single massive black hole ?",
    ", halo of massive objects surrounding the central mass ? ) will then come from the precision analysis of individual orbits , rather than from the present coarse , statistical tools . deep diffraction limited , adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy will result in observations of more stars and of even faster moving stars within @xmath70.1@xmath2 of sgra@xmath0 ( cusp ? ) .",
    "the ao imaging also will probe deeper down the main sequence and make feasible the detection of gravitational microlensing of background stars by the central black hole ( alexander and sternberg 1999 ) .",
    "imaging spectroscopy will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of this unique stellar cluster .",
