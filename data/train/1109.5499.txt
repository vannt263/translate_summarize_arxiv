    "recently , the mechanical exfoliation technique , applied to layered materials , has lead to the fabrication of new bidimensional systems , i.e. , atomically thin layers.@xcite graphene,@xcite a planar sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice , is the most famous bidimensional material and exhibits intriguing physical properties not found in its bulk counterpart graphite.@xcite however , the absence of a bandgap makes its use in electronic devices ( transistors ) difficult .",
    "several strategies were proposed to overcome this setback by opening a gap : quantum confinement in nanoribbons,@xcite deposition of a graphene monolayer on boron nitride,@xcite applying an electric field in bilayer graphene,@xcite etc . nevertheless , the experimental realization of a bandgap larger than 400 mev remains a challenge,@xcite besides of a deterioration of other graphene properties , in particular the high mobility .",
    "therefore , the fabrication of atomically thin sheets of other materials , with a finite bandgap , appears as the natural strategy in the search of materials for a new generation of electronic devices .    in recent experiments , molybdenum disulfide",
    "( mos@xmath0 ) , an indirect semiconductor of bandgap 1.29 ev in its bulk phase , has exhibited a direct bandgap of 1.75 ev in its single - layer phase , together with an enhancement of the luminescence quantum yield in comparison with the mos@xmath0 bulk.@xcite moreover , radisavljevic _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite have demonstrated suitable properties of a single - layer mos@xmath0-based transistor , like a room - temperature electron mobility close to that of graphene nanoribbons and a high on / off ratio .",
    "therefore , single - layer mos@xmath0 has become an appealing material in the area of optoelectronic devices , being an alternative and/or complement to graphene . from other layered compounds such as ws@xmath0 , mos@xmath0 , bn,  monolayers can be produced by ( liquid ) exfoliation as well.@xcite moreover , mos@xmath0 and other layered materials are also interesting due to change of certain properties with respect to its bulk counterparts .",
    "finally , their topology facilitates the chemical identification atom - by - atom.@xcite    recent raman spectroscopy measurements of mos@xmath0 single and multi - layers have revealed unexpected trends of the vibrational properties when the number of layers changes .",
    "al.__@xcite reported a decrease in frequency of the optical @xmath2 phonon mode with increasing number of layers .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that in bulk mos@xmath0 the infrared active @xmath3 mode ( where neighboring layers are vibrating in - phase ) is slightly lower in frequency than the raman active @xmath2 mode ( where neighboring layers are vibrating with a phase shift of @xmath4).@xcite but both observations contradict the naive expectation that the week inter - layer forces should increase the effective restoring forces acting on atoms .",
    "one would thus rather expect a slight increase of the frequency of the raman active mode with respect to the ir active mode @xcite and , accordingly , an increase of the frequency of the bulk raman active mode with respect to the corresponding single - layer mode . as a plausible explanation of this anomalous trend",
    "the long range coulomb interaction was mentioned.@xcite the purpose of our article is the clarification of this issue by a detailed ab - initio study of the inter - atomic force constants , separating the short - range and the long range coulomb parts .",
    "we show in the following , that the anomalous trend in the @xmath2 mode frequency is caused by the dielectric screening of the long range coulomb forces in bulk mos@xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", we present a full ab - initio study of the phonon dispersion relations of the phonon dispersion relations of single - layer and of bulk mos@xmath0 and the intimately related material ws@xmath0 .",
    "( tungsten is in the same column of the periodic system as molybdenum ) .",
    "apart from a study of the vibrational stability of mos@xmath0 nanoribbons,@xcite a fully comprehensive _ ab initio _ study of the vibrational properties of these materials is still absent in the literature .    in section",
    "ii we present the methods for the calculation of the phonon dispersions and the analysis of the force constants . in section iii",
    "we discuss the phonon dispersion relations of mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 single layers and bulk and compare with experimental data . in section iv",
    ", we present the calculated results for the evolution of the raman active phonon modes as a function of the number of layers and give an explanation in terms of the short - range and long - range contributions to the force constants .",
    "mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 belong to the dichalcogenide family of materials , built up of weakly ( van der waals ) bonded s - mo - s single - layers as shown in fig .",
    "[ unitcell ] .",
    "each one of these single - layers consists of two hexagonal planes of s atoms and an intercalated hexagonal plane of mo atoms bound with the sulfur atoms in a trigonal prismatic arrangement .",
    "the symmetry space group of bulk mos@xmath0 is @xmath5 ( point group @xmath6 ) .",
    "the space group of the single layer is @xmath7 ( point group @xmath8 ) .",
    "consequently , systems with even number of layers belong to the space group @xmath5 ( with inversion symmetry ) , and systems with odd number of layers to the @xmath7 space group ( without inversion symmetry ) .     bulk and single - layer .",
    "the interlayer distance is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) slide and top view of the mos@xmath0 bulk unit cell ( analogously for ws@xmath0 ) unit cell .",
    "the primitive vectors are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the weak layer interaction is indicated by a spring.,width=7 ]    the phonon calculations begins with the determination of the equilibrium geometry ( i.e. the relative atomic positions in the unit cell which yield zero forces and the lattice constants which leads to a zero - stress tensor ) .",
    "the calculations have been done with density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the open - source code abinit,@xcite within the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite we use hartwigsen - goedecker - hutter pseudopotentials@xcite ( including the semi - core electrons as valence electrons in the case of mo and w ) and a plane - wave cutoff at 60 ha .",
    "the first brillouin zone is sampled with a @xmath13 monkhorst - pack grid for bulk and @xmath14 for single and few - layers systems .",
    "the optimized lattice parameters are shown in table  [ lattice ] .",
    "the experimental lattice parameters of mos@xmath15 are @xmath16 and @xmath17 .@xcite in the case of ws@xmath0 they are @xmath18 and @xmath19 .@xcite our lda calculations underestimate them by 0.7 % and 2.1 % , respectively .",
    "the slight underestimations of the in - plane lattice constant is a common feature of the lda which tends to overestimate the strength of covalent bonds .",
    "for the single - layer , we checked the influence of the exchange - correlation potential on the geometry and the phonon dispersion by performing calculations within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite for the single - layer of both mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , we obtain a lattice constant @xmath20  , 1.76 % larger than the lda value and 0.96 % larger than the experimental ( bulk ) value .",
    "correspondingly , the phonon frequencies are reduced by an almost constant factor of 1.04 % throughout the whole phonon dispersion .",
    "the correct description of the @xmath21 parameter is less evident because the lda ( and other semi - local functionals ) completely neglect the van der waals component of the inter - layer - interaction . at the same time",
    ", however , the lda strongly overestimates the ( weak ) covalent part of the inter - layer bonding .",
    "thus , the lda has quite successfully reproduced the geometry and also given reasonable results for layer phonon modes of different layered materials such as graphite@xcite and hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn),@xcite as well as of single - layers of hbn@xcite and graphene@xcite on a ni(111 ) surface .",
    "we thus expect ( and the obtained value for @xmath21 supports this expectation ) that the lda works reasonably well for the inter - layer phonons of the mos@xmath0 .",
    "we note that a physically correct description of the equilibrium geometry , and the potential energy surface around , would require the proper treatment of van der waals contribution , e.g. on the level of the random - phase approximation as it has been done for bulk hbn@xcite and for graphite.@xcite alternatively , non - local functionals that are optimized for the description of the van der waals interaction@xcite could be used .",
    "both approaches are , however , out of the scope of the present work .    for the calculations of single - layer and few - layers systems ,",
    "we have used a periodic supercell , leaving enough distance between adjacent sheets .",
    "for instance , we use @xmath22 angstroms in the case of a single - layer .",
    "the remaining interlayer interaction has negligible effects on the phonon frequencies .",
    "all the results show a slight reduction of the in - plane lattice constant together with a slight stretching of the vertical distances , with the total effect of a smaller mo - s bond length for decreasing number of layers , being 2.382    for single - layer and 2.384    for bulk mos@xmath0 .",

    "these phonon frequencies are the solution of the secular equation    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the phonon wave - vector , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the atomic masses of atoms @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the dynamical matrix is then defined as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 denotes the displacement of atom @xmath29 in direction @xmath33 .",

    "thus , @xmath38 means a binding ( anti - binding ) force in direction @xmath33 acting on atom @xmath29 when atom j is displaced in direction @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth to mention that the diagonal term in the atom index , @xmath39 , corresponds , according to newton s third law , to the total force exerted in the @xmath33-direction on the atom @xmath29 , when the displacements of the atoms @xmath30 in the @xmath34-direction is are set to one:@xcite    @xmath40    this term is always positive ( unless the crystal is unstable ) and in the following we refer to it as self - interaction .",
    "( [ selfforce ] ) demonstrates the contribution of many atoms to the self - interaction .",
    "one can distinguish two contributions , the short range part ( which is mainly due to covalent bonding to the close neighbors ) and the ewald or long range part@xcite ( due to the coulomb forces between the effective charges ) .",
    "this distinction will be helpful to interpret the evolution of the self interaction for varying layer thickness and to understand the unexpected trends of the phonon frequencies ( section [ secthick ] ) .    for the calculation of the dynamical matrix we have used density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt)@xcite where atomic displacements are taken as a perturbation potential and the resulting changes in electron density and energy",

    "the phonon frequency can be obtained for arbitrary @xmath26 , with calculation only in a single unit - cell .    since mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 are",
    "slightly polar materials , certain ir active phonon modes at @xmath41 give rise to a macroscopic electric field .",
    "this electric fields affects the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons in the limit @xmath42 , breaking the degeneracy of the lo mode with the transversal optical ( to ) mode.@xcite thus , in bulk mos@xmath0 and wos@xmath0 , the nonanalytic part of the dynamical matrix ( which contains the effective charges and the dielectric tensor ) must be calculated in order to obtain the correct frequencies at the brillouin zone - center.@xcite the lo - to splitting for the @xmath3 mode has the value of 2.8 @xmath43 . in the case of a single or few - layers system , this effect is even smaller .",
    "we start our analysis of the vibrational properties with the description of the general features of the phonon dispersions of bulk and single - layer mos@xmath0 , shown in figure  [ mos2_phon ] .",
    "we have also depicted the experimental data obtained with neutron inelastic scattering spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "the overall agreement between theory and experiment is good , even for the inter - layer modes .",
    "this confirms our expectation that the lda describes reasonably well the inter - layer interaction ( even though not describing the proper physics of the inter - layer forces ) .",
    "the bulk phonon dispersion has three acoustic modes .",
    "those that vibrate in - plane ( longitudinal acoustic , la , and transverse acoustic , ta ) have a linear dispersion and higher energy than the out - of - plane acoustic ( za ) mode .",
    "the latter displays a @xmath44-dependence analogously to that of the za mode in graphene ( which is a consequence of the point - group symmetry@xcite ) .",
    "the low frequency optical modes are found at 35.2 and 57.7 @xmath43 and correspond to rigid - layer shear / vertical motion , respectively ( in analogy with the low frequency optical modes in graphite@xcite ) .",
    "when the wave number @xmath26 increases , the acoustic and low frequency optical branches almost match .",
    "it is worth to mention the absence of degeneracies at the high symmetry points @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the two crossings of the la and ta branches just before and after the @xmath45 point .    .",

    "this unexpected behavior can be explained by an increase of the dielectric screening which reduces the long range coulomb interaction between the effective charges and thus reduces the overall restoring force on the atoms .",
