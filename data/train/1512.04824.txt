    "the standard approach in cosmology is to assume that we can describe the large - scale expansion of the universe using a single homogeneous and isotropic solution to einstein s field equations .",
    "this is commonly known as the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solution . however , general relativity is known to be valid locally and there is no unique way to average tensors . hence , the flrw solution might not be the best way to approximate the large - scale expansion of the universe .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the `` back - reaction '' problem in cosmology@xcite . also , there is no perturbative scheme that works consistently on all scales , in the presence of non - linear structure .",
    "cosmological perturbation theory works well on large scales but breaks down on small scales in non - linear regimes@xcite .",
    "conversely , post - newtonian perturbation schemes work well on small scales but break down on the very largest scales , and in the presence of strong gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "we sidestep these issues by constructing a bottom - up approach to cosmology using the post - newtonian approximation to gravity , the details of which can be found in sanghai _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the effect of non - linear structure on the large - scale expansion of the universe",
    ". such an approach may be useful for interpreting data from future large - scale surveys such as _ _ euclid__@xcite and _ _ ska__@xcite ( square kilometre array ) .",
    "in this section we will briefly describe how we construct a post - newtonian cosmology .",
    "we begin by splitting the universe up into a large numbers of cells and placing them next to each other to form a periodic lattice structure .",
    "each cell is identical to every other up to translations , rotations and reflections . at a single instance of time",
    ", the cell shape can be any regular convex polyhedron .",
    "in general , there are 11 possible ways to tesselate our universe using regular convex polyhedra@xcite .",
    "the tessellation also depends on whether our universe is open , closed or flat . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , we have one possible example : cubic cells .",
    "the geometry inside of each cell is given by a perturbed minkowski metric that satisfies the post - newtonian formalism .",
    "the details of what we mean by the post - newtonian formalism is given in sanghai _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "this means that our cell size must be much less then the hubble radius , as the boundaries of a cell must have a velocity that is much less than the speed of light . to make our model tractable",
    ", we also assume reflective symmetry across the boundary of every pair of cells .",
    "now we can join these perturbed minkowski , weak field patches to construct a global spacetime .",
    "we match these cells together using israel junction conditions@xcite that are , in the absence of surface layers , given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the induced metric , and @xmath2 is the extrinsic curvature of the boundary , defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the coordinates on the boundary , and @xmath5 is the space - like unit vector normal to the boundary . in our model",
    "the boundary is a @xmath6 dimensional time - like hypersurface . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , mirror symmetry implies that @xmath7 .",
    "symmetry therefore demands that @xmath8 this implies that @xmath9 , or , in other words , @xmath10 .",
    "this then allows us to evaluate the equation of motion for the boundary of a cell .",
    "as each cell is identical , this also tells how we should expect the large - scale expansion of the universe to behave@xcite .",
    "for our model we consider a late time universe filled with normal matter , where the pressure of matter is much less than the energy density .",
    "we then work out the effect of non - linear structure on the large - scale expansion of the universe . in sanghai _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite we have derived the equation of motion for the boundary of any regular convex polyhedra , up to post - newtonian orders , i.e up to o(@xmath11 ) corrections . due to the periodicity of our model , this also tells how we expect the large - scale expansion of our universe to behave . in the specific case of cubic cells , at newtonian order",
    ", we obtain @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance from the centre of the cell to the centre of the cell face , @xmath14 is the mass of the matter within a cell , and @xmath15 is an integration constant that comes from the initial conditions .",
    "@xmath16 behaves like the scale factor and @xmath15 mimicks a gaussian curvature - like term , when compared to the the standard friedmann equation for a universe filled with normal matter . for",
    "regularly arranged point - like masses in cubic cells , at post - newtonian orders , we obtain @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are positive constants that we have found in sanghai et al.@xcite . at post - newtonian orders",
    "the correction looks like a radiation term .",
    "however , this is not an actual radiation term .",
    "this term is purely due to the non - linearity of einstein s field equations , and the inhomogeneity of our model .",
    "the size of the post - newtonian correction depends on the size of the cell .",
    "for a cell size around the homogeneity scale _ i.e. _ about 100 mpc , the correction would be about @xmath20 times the leading - order dust - like term .",
    "we did not need to perform any averaging to obtain our results due to the periodicity of our model .",
    "so far we have only considered coordinate distances and coordinate times . however , in sanghai _ _ et al.__@xcite we transform these quantities into coordinate independent quantities such as proper length along the edge of a cell , and proper time of an observer moving along one of the corners of these cells .",
    "the results we obtain have a similar functional form .",
    "the standard friedmann - like behaviour that we obtain at newtonian order is a purely emergent phenomena .",
    "this is in contrast to other models such as the swiss cheese models that start with a flrw background and embed schwarzschild or lematre - tolman - bondi patches within them@xcite .",
    "however , our model has the disadvantage of only working perturbatively , whereas these models can be solved exactly .",
    "the existence of a radiation - like term has also been found previously in other models .",
    "firstly , in the case of regularly arranged black holes in a lattice under reflective symmetric boundary conditions@xcite , and secondly in the case of the short wavelength approximation for fluctuations around a background metric@xcite .",
    "we have constructed a perturbative framework that consistently tracks non - linear effects of small - scale structure on the large - scale expansion .",
    "future developments of this work might include calculating observables in these type of models .",
    "one could also try to generalize our model by reducing the amount of symmetry that is assumed . with future large - scale surveys , such as _ _ euclid__@xcite and _ _ ska__@xcite , we will have more data to help understand the large - scale expansion of the universe .",
    "inhomogeneous models may then help us include non - linear gravitational effects that are usually neglected .",
