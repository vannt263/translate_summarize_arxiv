    "( @xmath0 , see table  [ tbl : abbreviations ] on the next page for the list of acronyms ) modulators are widely used in oversampling ad ( analog - to - digital ) and da ( digital - to - analog ) converters , by which we can achieve high performance with coarse quantizers  @xcite .",
    "they have applications in digital signal processing systems , such as digital audio  @xcite and digital communications  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the notion of @xmath0 modulators is extended to several research areas related to signal processing . in  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 scheme is introduced for quantizing coefficients in finite but redundant frame expansion of signals , and is proved to outperform the standard pcm ( pulse code modulation ) scheme .",
    "based on this study , @xmath0 scheme is also applied to compressed sensing  @xcite . in  @xcite , dynamic quantizers as @xmath0 modulators are proposed for controlling linear time - invariant systems with discrete - valued control inputs .",
    "the @xmath0 scheme is also applied to obtain an approximate solution of large discrete quadratic programming problems  @xcite . for independent source separation  @xcite and manifold learning  @xcite ,",
    "machine learning is combined with @xmath2 modulation , called the _",
    "@xmath2 learner_.    in designing @xmath0 modulators , noise shaping is a fundamental issue  @xcite .    0.1 in    ( 20.0000 , 9.2000 ) ( 4.0000,-11.0000 )    ( 10.0000,-5.0000)(0,0)@xmath3(18.0000,-5.0000)(0,0)@xmath4(22.0000,-4.5000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath5(14.0000,-4.5000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath6(4.0000,-3.5000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath7    to describe the issue of noise shaping , let us consider a general @xmath0 modulator shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta - sigma ] . in this figure",
    ", @xmath4 is a quantizer and @xmath8 $ ] is a linear filter with 2 inputs and 1 output . the filter @xmath9 shapes the signal transfer function ( stf ) from the input @xmath7 to the output @xmath5 to have a unity magnitude in the frequency band of interest . on the other hand , the filter @xmath10 eliminates the in - band quantization noise by shaping the noise transfer function ( ntf ) .",
    "then , if the input signal @xmath7 is sufficiently oversampled , the frequency components in @xmath7 are concentrated in the band of interest , and hence one can effectively extract the original signal @xmath7 from the quantized signal @xmath5 by applying a lowpass filter to @xmath5 with a suitable cutoff frequency .",
    "in fact , it is theoretically shown that the reconstruction error decreases rapidly as the oversampling ratio increases  @xcite .",
    "a usual solution to noise shaping is to insert accumulators ( or integrators ) in the feedback loop to attenuate the magnitude of the ntf in low frequency . to improve upon the performance",
    ", accumulators are cascaded in various ways such as the mash ( multi - stage noise - shaping ) modulators  @xcite .",
    "this methodology is analogous to a pid ( proportional - integral - derivative ) control  @xcite , in which the performance of the designed system depends on the experience of the designer .",
    "that is , the conventional design is of ad hoc nature .    to obtain a systematic design method",
    ", one can adopt a more general type of transfer functions than accumulators for @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta - sigma ] . from this point of view",
    ", the ntf zero optimization  @xcite was proposed to shape the ntf _ optimally _ in the frequency band of interest , say @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "this optimization is done by changing the zeros of the ntf so as to minimize the normalized noise power given by the integral of the squared magnitude of the ntf over @xmath11 $ ] . while this method gives a systematic way to design @xmath0 modulators , it can yield a peak in the magnitude of the ntf at a certain frequency , since such a peak can not be captured by an integrated or averaged objective function .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite has investigated this problem and proposed to use semi - infinite programming for constraining the maximum value of a function over the frequency band .",
    "this method , however , does not necessarily optimize the overall performance but only minimizes the denominator of a loop - filter .",
    "that is , the method  @xcite does not necessarily reduce peaks in the ntf magnitude . also , the computational cost for the optimization is very high due to its infinite dimensionality .",
    "alternatively , the present authors has proposed to adopt @xmath1 optimization for attenuating the ntf magnitude itself with a frequency - domain weighting function  @xcite .",
    "this method gives a good performance _ if _ a suitable weighting function was chosen . for general notion of @xmath1 optimization in signal processing ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the well - known remez exchange method ( aka parks - mcclellan method )  @xcite is related to the @xmath1 optimization .",
    "the method gives a near - optimal filter that minimizes the maximum error between a given desired filter and the filter to be designed .",
    "strictly speaking , this is not @xmath1-optimal since the response is ignored on the transition frequency band .",
    "in contrast to these methods , we propose ) , bandpass modulator design ( section  [ subsec : gkyp_bp ] ) , and stability theorems ( section  [ sec : stability ] ) .",
    "simulation results in section  [ sec : examples ] are also new . ] a novel design based on _ min - max _ optimization , which can be reduced to finite dimensional convex optimization .",
    "that is , we directly _ minimize the maximum magnitude _ of the ntf over the frequency band of interest . in other words , we design @xmath0 modulators in order to uniformly attenuate the magnitude over the prespecified band .",
    "this uniform minimization improves the _ worst - case _ snr ( signal - to - noise ratio ) to be defined in section  [ subsec : worstcase ] , of the modulator in the band of interest .",
    "conversely , a peak of the ntf magnitude as above can deteriorate the worst - case snr and also the dynamic range of the modulator .",
    "we propose in this paper a more effective method that does not require a selection of a weighting function .    to this end , we first characterize all stabilizing loop - filters for a linearized modulator . then , by using this parametrization , we formulate the design problem as an optimization via a linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) for lowpass and bandpass modulators using the generalized kalman - yakubovich - popov ( kyp ) lemma  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can assign arbitrarily zeros of the ntf on the unit circle in the complex plane by adding a linear matrix equality ( lme ) constraint to the lmi .",
    "these techniques are mostly adopted from _",
    "control theory_. recently , control theory is effectively applied to @xmath0 modulator design with finite horizon predictive control  @xcite , sliding mode control  @xcite , and robust control  @xcite , to name a few . in particular , the idea of applying the generalized kyp lemma to @xmath0 modulator design is proposed in  @xcite , in which they assume a one - bit quantizer for @xmath4 and optimize the average power of the reconstruction error in low frequency for lowpass modulators .",
    "in contrast , our approach minimizes the _ worst _ reconstruction error , which can improve the overall snr as mentioned above .",
    "stability analysis of @xmath0 modulators is another fundamental issue . for first - order  @xcite and second - order  @xcite modulators ,",
    "stability is well - studied in terms of invariant set . on the other hand ,",
    "we derive a stability condition taking account of nonlinearity in @xmath0 modulators of arbitrary order with general quantizers including uniform ones .",
    "this condition is derived in terms of a state - space representation , and is described by the @xmath12 norm of a linear system .",
    "this can be transformed into an @xmath1-norm condition of the ntf as a sufficient condition .",
    "this @xmath1-norm constraint can be equivalently expressed as an lmi via the kyp lemma  @xcite . in summary",
    ", the proposed method can be described by lmi s and lme s , which can be solved effectively by numerical optimization softwares such as yalmip  @xcite and sedumi  @xcite with matlab .",
