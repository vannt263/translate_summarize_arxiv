    "the experimental achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the trapped atomic clouds@xcite has opened up a novel field to investigate fundamental problems such as the relationship between the superfluidity and bec .",
    "owing to recent advances of experimental techniques , several groups have succeeded in creating quantized vortices with various procedures in the magnetically trapped bec@xcite , where the condensate is described by a scalar order parameter .",
    "furthermore , the atomic gases with the hyperfine spin @xmath3 called `` spinor bec '' have been bose - condensed via optical methods@xcite which can keep the atomic `` spin '' states degenerate and active . as shown recently by klausen _",
    "et al_.@xcite , the spin - dependent interaction of two @xmath4rb atoms is ferromagnetic .",
    "thus , we now have spinor bec s with both antiferromagnetic ( @xmath5na)@xcite and ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "such scalar and spinor bec s are analogous to superfluid @xmath6he and @xmath7he .",
    "these superfluid heliums , however , have rather strong interactions . indeed ,",
    "the condensate fraction in superfluid @xmath7he is only 10@xmath8 of the total .",
    "by contrast , bec of the atomic gases have advantages for both theoretical and experimental treatments due to their weak interactions ; here almost all the atoms are able to be bose - condensed .",
    "it is possible to directly observe dynamical behaviors of the condensate with optical methods , providing us an opportunity to quantitatively investigate the new quantum fluid@xcite .",
    "the standard hamiltonian for the spinor bec have been introduced by ohmi and machida@xcite , and ho@xcite , who pointed out the richness of the exotic topological defects .",
    "topological structures , such as skyrmion , meron , mermin - ho ( anderson - toulouse ) texture , and monopole , play an important role in various fields of physics .",
    "they provide a common framework to connect diverse field , thereby enhancing mutual understanding@xcite .",
    "specially , since @xmath9 ferromagnetic bec can be described by order parameters similar to the superfluid @xmath6he - a , the coreless mermin - ho vortex may be favored in the ferromagnetic bec@xcite .",
    "similar topological structures , called skyrmion in general , have been proposed in the spinor bec .",
    "al khawaja and stoof @xcite studied a skyrmion in the @xmath9 ferromagnetic bec and concluded that it is not a thermodynamically stable object without rotation . by considering the effect of the external rotation , however , we have shown recently@xcite that this topological defect can be stable .",
