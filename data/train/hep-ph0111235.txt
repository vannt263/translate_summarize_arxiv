    "major theory issues in @xmath0-physics are 1 ) is the ckm description of cp violation correct or are there other sources of cp violation ? and 2 ) is the standard model the correct effective theory up scales of order @xmath1 tev ? the latter could be probed for example with flavor - changing - neutral current ( fcnc ) decays such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "both questions can be addressed in @xmath0-physics in a unique way , which has stimulated many experimental and theoretical activities .",
    "however , there is another one 3 ) is our understanding of non - perturbative qcd good enough to answer the above questions ? which is part of the whole picture . among effects due to hadronization ,",
    "those related to the factorization of matrix elements of hadronic 2-body decays are of peak importance .",
    "their understanding and knowledge of the limitations in their theoretical description will become more urgent in the near future since the ` qcd background ' limits the potential of precision tests of the standard model .",
    "fortunately , there are many decay modes , observables and facilities where this can be further explored and checked .",
    "naive factorization is a working hypothesis @xcite , which allows one to express the matrix elements of hadronic 2-body decays in terms of known objects , with the product ( decay constant @xmath5 form factor ) .",
    "diagrammatically , it amounts to cutting the amplitude across the @xmath6-boson line and resembles the description of semileptonic decays .",
    "the picture of color transparency ( ct ) @xcite justifies this for some decays when the meson emitted from the weak vertex is fast in the rest frame of the decaying parent .",
    "an example is @xmath7 .",
    "the ct explanation however must fail e.g.  for @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 counting arguments @xcite are at work , then factorization would still hold here",
    ". there exist no general theory for all 2-body decays , but they have been classified into color allowed , suppressed , heavy - light , etc .",
    "qcd based approaches @xcite differ in their treatment of @xmath10 and @xmath11 power corrections .",
    "thus it is important to test experimentally where ( naive ) factorization holds and where corrections arise to understand its dynamical origin ( ct , @xmath9 , ... ) .",
    "factorization has been tested with tree level dominated modes , i.e.  where possible new physics effects are tiny .",
    "currently , the factorization concept in color allowed @xmath12-decays rules :    * heavy - to - light @xmath13 decays can be described by one universal coefficient @xmath14 , see e.g.  @xcite ; factorization is ok up to the @xmath15 level .",
    "* in @xmath16 decays , where @xmath17 the factorization hypothesis can be tested as a function of the hadronic mass @xmath18 of the emitted @xmath19 state @xcite . its ` decay constant ' @xmath20 is obtained from hadronic @xmath21-data .",
    "ct holds if @xmath22 is fast , so one expects corrections to factorization for growing @xmath18 , but no kinematical dependence in the @xmath9 approach .",
    "current data indicate no factorization breaking but further experimental studies should be pursued .",
    "* in @xmath23 decays there is no ct explanation of factorization .",
    "the factorizable amplitude is proportional to @xmath24 and quantitative tests need good control over all parameters on the r.h.s .",
    "experimentally , to date an upper bound exists , @xmath25 @xmath26 c.l .",
    "@xcite which is ok with factorization . * in heavy - to - heavy @xmath27 decays factorization holds within errors @xcite ; confirmed by study including penguins @xcite .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in these analyses comes from the decay constants , e.g.  @xmath28 mev from @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "significant improvement in precision is required to isolate factorization breaking effects in the above decays .",
    "alternatively , one can study factorization in those decays , where the corrections to factorization are not hidden behind a large factorizable contribution @xcite . then less precision is required , although for the price of less events .",
    "examples of ` designer ' mesons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar ones are expected for @xmath30 decays accessible at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "the qcd factorization result shows an enhancement over the one obtained in the naive factorization approach .",
    "however , the branching ratios are still much smaller than the ones of the corresponding ` non - designer ' modes like @xmath31 , but within experimental reach .",
    "since qcd factorization picks up hard @xmath10 contributions which are enhanced in the designer decays , their amplitude is more sensitive to the renormalization scale and gains large strong phases .",
    "current dominant uncertainties are due to the decay constants , which could be measured in hadronic @xmath21 decays , see table [ tab : tau ] .",
    "furthermore , information on the da s of the neutral @xmath32 could be obtained from @xmath33 collisions in @xmath34 processes similar to the analysis performed by cleo for @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "time dependent measurements in @xmath37 decays allow the extraction of ckm angles @xmath36 together with strong phases without model assumptions on strong dynamics @xcite .",
    "unfortunalty , the effect scales with a tiny @xmath38 asymmetry .",
    "choosing instead @xmath39 decays , where @xmath40 the ckm hierarchy of the amplitudes is compensated by the decay constants and large @xcite , for example for the @xmath41 @xmath42 therefor designer mesons are competitive with @xmath43 decays and help to resolve ambiguities because different and large strong phases are involved .",
    "factorization successfully works in color allowed @xmath0-decays within present errors .",
    "this includes @xmath44 decays where the color transparency explanation is absent .",
    "more data are needed to see to what accuracy it works and perhaps to understand why it works .",
    "i discussed new strategies to explore factorization with modes where the factorizable contribution is suppressed such that the corrections show up isolated .",
    "this is similar to pure annihilation decays @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these measurements could be carried out at operating and future high luminosity @xmath48-facilities @xcite .",
    "a dedicated factorization study requires improved knowledge of non - perturbative input such as decay constants and distribution amplitudes .",
    "their determination should be part of such an experimental program .",
    "a qualitatively and quantitatively accurate description of hadronic matrix elements in @xmath12-decays is particularly important for the extraction of the ckm unitarity angles @xmath49 and @xmath50 . finally , ` designer ' final states and modes are also promising to study cp violation and to search for new physics effects in rare fcnc processes . steps in this direction",
    "have already been undertaken @xcite .",
