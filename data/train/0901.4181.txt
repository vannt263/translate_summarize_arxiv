    "@xmath33 is the shear viscosity and @xmath34 is the relaxation time .",
    "it may be mentioned that in a conformally symmetric fluid relaxation equation can contain additional terms @xcite .",
    "assuming boost - invariance , eqs.[eq3 ] and [ eq4 ] are solved in @xmath35 coordinates , with a code `` azhydro - kolkata '' , developed at the cyclotron centre , kolkata .",
    "details of the code can be found in @xcite . to show that azhydro - kolkata computes the evolution correctly , in fig.[f1 ] ,",
    "we have compared the temporal evolution of momentum anisotropy @xmath36 of a qgp fluid with a calculation of song and heinz @xcite .",
    "initial conditions are same for both the simulations . within 10% or less ,",
    "azhydro - kolkata simulation reproduces song and heinz s @xcite result for temporal evolution of momentum anisotropy @xmath37 .",
    "one of the most important inputs of a hydrodynamic model is the equation of state ( eos ) . through this",
    "input macroscopic hydrodynamic models make contact with the microscopic world .",
    "most of the hydrodynamical calculations are performed with eos with a 1st order phase transition .",
    "huovinen @xcite reported an ideal hydrodynamic simulation with 2nd order phase transition .",
    "he concluded that the experimental data ( e.g. elliptic flow of proton or antiproton ) are better explained with eos with 1st order phase transition than with eos with 2nd order phase transition .",
    "however , lattice simulations @xcite indicate that confinement to deconfinement transition is a cross over , rather than a 1st or 2nd order phase transition .",
    "it is then essential that hydrodynamic simulations are done with eos with cross - over transition rather than with eos with 1st or 2nd order transition . in fig.[f2 ] , a recent lattice simulation @xcite for the entropy density is shown .",
    "the solid line in fig.[f2 ] is a parameterisation of the entropy density .",
    "@xmath38[1+tanh\\frac{t - t_c}{\\delta t}],\\ ] ]    from the parametric form of the entropy density , pressure and energy density can be obtained using the thermodynamic relations ,    @xmath39    generally , in hydrodynamic simulations , hadronic phase is approximated by a ( non - interacting ) resonance hadron gas comprising all the resonances below 2 - 3 gev .",
    "as the lattice simulation cover a wide temperature range below the cross over temperature , @xmath40 mev , we choose to use the lattice based eos ( eq.[eq1]-[eq2b ] ) both in the qgp and in the hadronic phase .",
    "the idea is to expose the lattice simulation of eos to experimental scrutiny . indeed",
    ", lattice simulations are vague about the nature of the confined ( @xmath41 ) phase .",
    "the confined phase is certainly unlike hadronic resonance gas .",
    "the trace anomaly @xmath42 in the temperature range 140 - 200 mev is approximately 30% less than that of a hadronic resonance gas @xcite .",
    "one also note that at low temperature , effective degrees of freedom in the confined phase is @xmath432 .",
    "in contrast , in hadronic resonance gas , @xmath44 . in the inset of fig.[f2 ] , the squared speed of sound ( @xmath45 ) in the lattice based eos is compared with @xmath46 in an eos with 1st order phase transition @xcite , which model the quark phase with bag model , and the hadronic phase by the hadronic resonance gas . in 1st order eos ,",
    "@xmath46 fall sharply near the critical temperature .",
    "the fall is smoothened out in cross over transition .",
    "lattice based eos is also softer .",
    "solution of partial differential equations ( eqs.[eq3],[eq4 ] ) requires initial conditions , e.g. transverse profile of the energy density ( @xmath47 ) , fluid velocity ( @xmath48 ) and shear stress tensor ( @xmath49 ) at the initial time @xmath3 .",
    "one also need to specify the viscosity ( @xmath33 ) and the relaxation time ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "a freeze - out prescription is also needed to convert the information about fluid energy density and velocity to particle spectra and compare with experiment .    in @xcite",
    ", we assumed that the fluid is thermalised at @xmath3=0.2 fm and the initial fluid velocity is zero , @xmath50 .",

    ", we fit @xmath56 to reproduce star measurements of @xmath0 multiplicity in 0 - 5% centrality au+au collisions .",
    "centrality dependence of @xmath0 multiplicity and @xmath0 mean @xmath7 are simultaneously explained only with viscosity over entropy ratio @xmath2=0.25 .",
    "the corresponding central energy density , in b=0 au+au collision is @xmath4=5.1 @xmath5 .    for cu+cu collisions",
    ", we only change the central energy density , other parameters remain unchanged . the initial energy density in cu+cu collisions is obtained by fitting @xmath0 multiplicity in central 0 - 10% cu+cu collisions .",
    "the fitted value corresponds to central energy density @xmath4=3.48 @xmath5 in b=0 cu+cu collisions .",
    "as it will be shown below , qgp fluid , initialised with @xmath4=3.48 @xmath5 reproduces most of the star measurements on @xmath0 mesons in cu+cu collisions .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath57 .",
    "apparently , initial energy density scales with nuclear radius . with boost - invariance ,",
    "the initial system is a cylinder of radius @xmath58 , infinitely extended in the rapidity direction .",
    "phenomenological relation @xmath57 indicate that at the freeze - out also the system can be approximated again by a cylinder with radius @xmath59 .",
    "before we compare hydrodynamic simulation for @xmath0 production with experiment , it is interesting to compare initial central energy density in different centrality rages of au+au and cu+cu collisions . in fig.[f3 ] , we have compared the initial central energy density in au+au and in cu+cu collisions as a function of participant number .",
    "the black and red lines are for au+au and cu+cu collisions respectively . in the region where they overlap ,",
    "initial central energy density in au+au and cu+cu collisions are similar .",
    "one then expects that @xmath0 spectra in mid central au+au and central cu+cu collisions will be similar .",
    "the expectation is fulfilled in star experiment ( e.g. @xmath0 @xmath7 spectra in 40 - 50% au+au and 10 - 20% cu+cu collisions are nearly identical ) . in fig.[f3 ] , the dashed line is the energy density ( @xmath601.5 @xmath5 ) for the confinement - deconfinement cross - over . in most of the collisions , in the central region , initially the fluid is produced in the deconfined state . however , energy density has a distribution , fluid in the central region is at higher density than the fluid at periphery .",
    "thus in mid - central collisions , only a small portion of the fluid will be in the deconfined phase . in fig.[f4 ] , in four panels , we have shown the contours of initial energy density in 0 - 10% and 50 - 60% centrality au+au and in cu+cu collisions .",
    "contours are drawn at @xmath61=1.5 @xmath5 and @xmath62=0.05 @xmath5 , corresponding to cross - over energy density and freeze - out . in 0 - 10% centrality au+au and cu+cu collisions , initially",
    ", fluid in the central region is in qgp state .",
    "but fraction of fluid in qgp state is larger in au+au than in cu+cu collisions .",
    "one can immediately say that hard probe signature of qgp formation will be less prominent in 0 - 10% centrality cu+cu collisions than in 0 - 10% centrality au+au collisions .",
    "for example , one can conjecture that in 0 - 10% cu+cu collisions @xmath63 s will be less suppressed than in a 0 - 10% centrality au+au collision .",
    "experiments do vindicate the conjecture @xcite .",
