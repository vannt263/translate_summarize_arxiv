    "<S> boundary renormalisation group flows in this paper we examine rg flows of superconformal minimal models with boundary , generated by a boundary field . since no bulk perturbing field is allowed and the boundary perturbation preserves supersymmetry , the rg flow takes place in the space of possible supersymmetric boundary conditions , in which the fixed points are the superconformal ones .    to study flows starting from a cardy boundary condition it is convenient to choose the boundary condition on one of the edges of the strip to correspond to the @xmath77 primary field , that is @xmath78 or @xmath71 </S>",

    "<S> the final boundary condition can be read off in a similar way simply from the spectrum of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> since the boundary condition @xmath51 does not change along the flow ( it is not perturbed ) , if we start with the bosonic half of a ns verma module ( ns  ns or @xmath79@xmath79 ) and at the end of the flow we find bosonic part(s ) of verma module(s ) then this is a ns@xmath80ns ( or @xmath81 ) type flow . similarly , if we identify fermionic part(s ) then this indicates a ns@xmath82 ( or @xmath83ns ) type flow .    </S>",
    "<S> we have to choose the perturbing field on the boundary @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we would like a perturbation that preserves supersymmetry off - critically . </S>",
    "<S> ramond operators do not spoil supersymmetry but they are boundary condition changing operators , so they can not live on a boundary . </S>",
    "<S> neveu  </S>",
    "<S> schwarz fields of the form @xmath84 also preserve supersymmetry and they can be located on the boundary , so we choose this kind of perturbation . the perturbing operator should be relevant , that is its scaling dimension must be less than one . </S>",
    "<S> finally , since the hamiltonian is bosonic , @xmath85 must be fermionic . </S>",
    "<S> the choice @xmath86 satisfy all these conditions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath87 has conformal weight @xmath88 and @xmath89 is fermionic . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be seen from the fact that in the free fermion limit @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> our choice also has the advantage that this operator can live on every boundary that has supersymmetric relevant perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the following . </S>",
    "<S> an operator @xmath93 living on the boundary of the strip is mapped under the exponential map to an operator living on the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> we want this operator to leave the boundary condition unchanged along the axis , which means that the coefficients in for @xmath94 should be nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> since they can be related to the fusion coefficients this means that the representation @xmath95 should appear in the fusion of @xmath96 with itself are not fusion coefficients themselves , but this does not change the argument essentially . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath89 appears in the self fusion of all fields except for the ones in the first and the last column of the superconformal kac table ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) , but the corresponding boundaries do not have any relevant supersymmetric perturbations at all . </S>",
    "<S> also note that being a bosonic field , the fusion with @xmath87 maps the projected subspaces onto themselves .    </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation @xmath87 is an integrable one @xcite , but we shall not use this property in our analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the perturbed superconformal field theory takes the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbed theory @xmath101 and @xmath102 comes from the perturbation on the strip : @xmath103 the location of the left boundary is at @xmath104 and we are free to choose @xmath105 for calculating the spectrum . by the exponential map this on the @xmath106-plane </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath107 thus the complete hamiltonian on the plane can be written as @xmath108\\,.\\ ] ] since during a numerical calculation one works with dimensionless quantities we have to measure the volume ( @xmath49 ) and the energies in some typical mass or energy difference of the model , @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we use the dimensionless quantities @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 : @xmath114\\,.\\ ] ] the renormalisation group flow can be implemented by varying the volume @xmath115 while keeping the coupling constant @xmath116 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently  and we choose this way  one can keep @xmath115 fixed and vary @xmath116 on some interval . starting from @xmath117 , which is the ultraviolet ( uv ) limit , the matrix @xmath118 can be diagonalised at different positive and negative values of @xmath116 . in both directions the flow approaches a fixed point , that is a new supersymmetric conformal boundary condition . by we </S>",
    "<S> should observe the eigenstates rearranging themselves into a direct sum of super verma modules ( see the figures in the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> since by the coefficients in this sum can only take values 0 and 1 , we expect a simple sum of super verma modules at the end of the flows . from the degeneracy pattern of the eigenvalues we can identify the modules ( the boundary conditions ) using the characters and weight differences of the supersymmetric minimal model in question .    </S>",
    "<S> the truncated conformal space approach the method we use for organising the boundary flows is the so - called truncated conformal space approach , or tcsa . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the infinite dimensional hilbert space is truncated to a finite dimensional vector space by using only those states whose energy is not greater than a threshold value , @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to truncating the hilbert space at a given level . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is then diagonalised on this truncated space . </S>",
    "<S> one can think of this procedure as being equivalent to the variational method : the ansatzes for the energy eigenstates of the perturbed hamiltonian are finite linear combinations of the eigenstates of the conformal hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important that the errors of the tcsa diagonalisation are not under control . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it may happen that before the flow reaches the scaling region the truncation errors start to dominate . </S>",
    "<S> if we use various cuts and find that the flow picture does not change drastically ( only the precision of the result gets higher with higher cuts ) , then it means that the unpleasant case mentioned above does not happen .    of course establishing the endpoint of the renormalisation group flow by tcsa </S>",
    "<S> can not be regarded as a conclusive proof . </S>",
    "<S> what one can see is that the flow goes in the vicinity of some superconformal boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the exact infrared fixed point can never be reached by tcsa because of the truncation ( this can be observed in figure [ 5,7,1,5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are looking for the range where the tcsa trajectory is closest to the fixed point .    </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of the hamiltonian there are two ways for determining the eigenvalues of the total hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the first is to use an orhonormal basis for calculating the matrix elements , which requires an orthogonalisation process . </S>",
    "<S> we can avoid this by chosing the second way , in which the basis is not orhogonal . </S>",
    "<S> but then the numerical matrix to be diagonalised is @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the elements of the reciprocal basis , that is @xmath122 this amounts to calculating the matrix element @xmath123 where @xmath109 is the inner product matrix : @xmath124 using the notation @xmath125 it can be expressed as @xmath126.\\ ] ] here we made use of the fact that the basis elements @xmath127 are eigenvectors of @xmath128 .    </S>",
    "<S> computing the matrix elements of the perturbing field between descendant states the task is now to calculate the matrices @xmath109 and @xmath129 and then to determine the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space consists of the verma module of @xmath96 ( see eq . ) and as mentioned above , we choose the following basis elements : @xmath130 due to the singular vectors , not all of these are linearly independent . </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain a basis for the irreducible submodule by requiring the nonsingularity of the inner product matrix level by level . in the ramond sector </S>",
    "<S> we kept the states which had even number of @xmath43 operators . chosing the odd parity sector </S>",
    "<S> instead gives exactly the same result : the spectrum of the hamiltonian falls into two identical copies .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath118 is now a question of algebraic manipulations . </S>",
    "<S> we use the basic algebraic relations , and the definition of adjoint operators @xmath131 in the ramond case during the calculation of the inner product matrix @xmath109 we also demand that @xmath132 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 are primary ) , because the inner product of states with opposite @xmath16-parity must vanish .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the matrix @xmath129 is more difficult because it requires the usage of some commutation rules for reducing the matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> however , these commutation rules are different for the ramond and the neveu  schwarz case . </S>",
    "<S> let us deal with the two cases in turn .    </S>",
    "<S> ramond case [ ramondcase ] in the ramond case we can use the already mentioned commutational rules , and . we recall them because they lie at the heart of the algorythm . </S>",
    "<S> for the modes @xmath133 we saw ( cf .  )    @xmath134    similarly    @xmath135     + @xmath136 [ lrules ]    we make use of these formulae in reducing the three point functions . </S>",

    "<S> this also means that @xmath145 .    </S>",
    "<S> due to @xmath146 since @xmath147 @xmath148 which implies for @xmath145 @xmath149 we see that every matrix element can be traced back to the three point function @xmath150 which simply equals to a structure constant . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not need the numerical value of this constant , because it can be absorbed into the coupling constant @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical scale is fixed by the value of @xmath116 where the crossover takes place . </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested only in the asymptotic behaviour of the flows ( the fixed points ) , we do not need to fix the real physical scale .    </S>",

    "<S> we can derive the rules for reducing the three point functions using contour integration technique . </S>",
    "<S> from @xmath151 we obtain @xmath152 then for a three point function : @xmath153 with similar manipulations one can obtain rules for the remaining two initial positions of @xmath154 and their counterparts for the modes @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> these formulae can be obtained from the algebraic commutation relations as well . </S>",
    "<S> now they can be applied iteratively to the three point function in the following manner .    </S>",
    "<S> first we throw down all operators from the first field to the others :    @xmath156    then , exploiting that @xmath157 is now primary we throw everything from the rightmost field to the middle one :    @xmath158    [ right ]    certainly , in practice the sums truncate at the level of @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we eliminate the operators from the field @xmath129 ( @xmath157 and @xmath159 are now primary ) :    @xmath160    [ middle ]    now we can throw this @xmath161 and @xmath162 back onto the middle field using and repeat step . </S>",
    "<S> eventually some @xmath161 and possibly one @xmath162 can accumulate on the middle field . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of operators @xmath161 is simply differentiating . since conformal symmetry determines the functional form of the three point function of quasi - primary fields we obtain : @xmath163 the final result is  like in the ramond case  a linear combination of matrix elements , where the second one gives zero again .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason for not using contour integral technique in the ramond case is the presence of the cut in the operator product of @xmath3 with a ramond field .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that albeit @xmath143 is not really well - defined for @xmath96 being a neveu  </S>",
    "<S> schwarz field , the ramond method explained in section [ ramondcase ] still works in the neveu  schwarz case and gives the same result as the contour integral method .    </S>",
    "<S> previous results and expectations before turning to the result of the tcsa let us summarize the theoretical predictions for the boundary flows found in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our main resource is the paper of fredenhagen @xcite , where the author gives some predictions for boundary flows in general coset models . </S>",
    "<S> here we only summarize the consequences for the special case of superconformal minimal models .    </S>",
    "<S> the sm@xmath61 unitary superminimal models are realized by the @xmath164 coset models with @xmath165 . </S>",
    "<S> let us label the sectors of @xmath166 by @xmath167 , the sectors of @xmath168 by @xmath169 and the sectors of @xmath170 by @xmath171 . </S>",
    "<S> the sectors of the direct product are thus labeled by the pairs @xmath172 . </S>",
    "<S> these sectors split up with respect to the @xmath170 subalgebra , @xmath173 where @xmath174 are the sectors of the coset theory . </S>",
    "<S> only those coset sectors are allowed for which @xmath175 furthermore , there are identifications between these admissible representations : @xmath176 using the @xmath165 rule and the new variables ( the kac - indices )    @xmath177    the precise relations with the superminimal fields are ( see @xcite ) : @xmath178 in the neveu  </S>",
    "<S> schwarz sector the direct sum in corresponds to the sum of the @xmath16-projected subspaces . </S>",
    "<S> the identification translates to @xmath179 which is the well - known symmetry relation of the kac table of the superminimal models .    in the a - series of superminimal models the boundary conditions @xmath50 are labeled by triplets @xmath180 taking values in the same range as the sectors including selection and identification rules . </S>",
    "<S> the ns and @xmath79 boundary conditions correspond to the @xmath181 choices . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between our results and the predictions for the flows justifies this correspondence .    </S>",
    "<S> the boundary flows are predicted in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> first we have to find a boundary condition @xmath50 and a representation @xmath182 so that @xmath183 then a boundary flow is predicted between the following coset boundary configurations : @xmath184 if we want to study flows starting from the boundary condition @xmath180 with @xmath185 we can set @xmath186 and @xmath187 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice corresponds to the flow @xmath188 where the @xmath189 are the fusion coefficients in @xmath166 . </S>",
    "<S> + similarly , in the case of @xmath190 the choice @xmath191 and @xmath192 leads to the flow @xmath193 the boundary conditions which are not covered by these rules are for @xmath194 . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to the @xmath195 and @xmath196 states . </S>",
    "<S> ( the boundary conditions @xmath197 and @xmath198 do not have relevant supersymmetric perturbations . ) for @xmath199 the suitable choice is @xmath200 and @xmath201 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath202 finally , for @xmath203 one should choose @xmath200 and @xmath186 , which yields the flows @xmath204 let us summarize the @xmath205 case , when these results give @xmath206 multiplying both sides of these rules by @xmath207 we get back the rules for general @xmath115 . in the kac index language this is the , , disorder line rule  </S>",
    "<S> , discussed in paper @xcite : if there is a flow between boundary conditions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then there exists a flow between @xmath208 and @xmath209 where @xmath210 denotes the fusion product . for the boundary states of @xmath1 superminimal models </S>",
    "<S> the fusion rule should be used together with the rules and @xmath211 . in case of the other choice a @xmath212 swap is needed . ]    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath213    this means that we only need to determine the flows starting from states in the first row of the kac table , all the other flows are given by the fusion rules of the operator algebra .    </S>",
    "<S> the authors of paper @xcite have also derived the flows for some neveu  schwarz states in the first row of the kac table , but only for even @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> tcsa results we were searching the answers for the following questions .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> does our tcsa analysis affirm or disprove the predictions of the fredenhagen rules ? 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> do all the flows obey the disorder line rule ? </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> what happens in the @xmath21 even models , where both these rules and the classification of consistent boundary conditions are somewhat certain ?    </S>",
    "<S> we have positive answers for the first two questions . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the following rules can be read out from the tcsa analysis of the boundary flows of the unitary superconformal minimal model sm@xmath61 perturbed by the operator @xmath0 ( see also the appendix ) : [ class ]    1 .   for @xmath214 </S>",
    "<S> : 1 .   for @xmath215 </S>",
    "<S> + @xmath216 + this agrees with the fredenhagen result . according to the disorder line rule we found ( cf .  ): </S>",
    "<S> @xmath217 [ comment]these flows do not change the type of the boundary condition so on the right hand side all the boundary conditions are of the same type . thus , if two of them have different fermion parity , then the half - integer levels of one should combine with the integer levels of the other </S>",
    "<S> that is exactly what we observed . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   for @xmath218 + @xmath219 + note that if the initial boundary condition is of neveu  schwarz type , then the result of the flow is a ramond type boundary condition and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> we also identified the flows related to the flow by the disorder line rule : + @xmath220 + [ rule1b ] 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath221 : 1 .   for @xmath222 </S>",
    "<S> + @xmath223 + this again gives back the fredenhagen flow . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the disorder line rule applies : we identified the flows @xmath224 in the neveu  </S>",
    "<S> schwarz case these flows , just like their ancestors , change the type of the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the comment given in case [ comment ] is true here as well . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   for @xmath225 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath226 this is another example for a flow starting from a ramond boundary condition running to a neveu  </S>",
    "<S> schwarz one . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder line rule is consistent with the flows + @xmath227 + [ rule2b ]    it is interesting that despite the lack of a complete classification of consistent boundary states for @xmath21 even , our results indicate the same rules for these cases . </S>",
    "<S> the only exception is the boundary condition corresponding to the supersymmetric @xmath228 representation which could not be investigated directly by tcsa .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to note that via the symmetry transformation of the kac table ( @xmath229 , @xmath230 ) the rules , are mapped to the rules and , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the two groups of rules ( @xmath221 , @xmath214 ) are not independent .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that although one can only approach and never reach the fixed point , the endpoints are @xmath198 type boundary conditions that have no relevant supersymmetric perturbations , so it is reasonable to take our observations to be strong indications for the real result .    </S>",
    "<S> conclusions in this work we investigated the renormalisation group flows of boundary conditions in @xmath1 superconformal minimal models . starting from a pure cardy - type boundary condition , the ( supersymmetry preserving ) perturbating operator @xmath231 induces a renormalisation group flow whose infrared fixed points are again superconformal invariant boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown , the fredenhagen rules @xcite for boundary flows in general coset theories predict the ir fixed points of our flows . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted flows obey a product rule called disorder line rule @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we used the tcsa method to check the fredenhagen rules . </S>",
    "<S> we found that these rules held in every case that we investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that there are flows which go from a neveu  schwarz type boundary condition to a ramond type , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we showed that all the flows obey the disorder line rule .    </S>",
    "<S> although for @xmath21 even both these predictions and the description of boundary states are flawed by the presence of the supersymmetric representation , our analysis implies that a natural extension of the rules are valid for these models .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several possibilities for continuing this work . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is its extension to the study of the more complicated space of flows of non - cardy type boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to consider @xmath232 models , which have direct relevance in string theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , although the tcsa analysis should be straightforward in principle , we expect too many states for reasonably high cuts , which can spoil the applicability of tcsa in practice </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to include non - unitary models , too . </S>",
    "<S> the energies typically become complex in these models ( like for ordinary minimal models , as reported in @xcite ) , which makes the identification of the endpoint rather difficult .      </S>",
    "<S> i would like to thank my supervisor , gbor takcs for his guidance , help and the interesting discussions . </S>",
    "<S> i am also grateful to stefan fredenhagen for his valuable remarks . </S>"
