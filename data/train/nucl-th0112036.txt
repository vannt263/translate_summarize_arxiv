    "hyperons ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) have lifetimes of the order of @xmath14  sec ( apart from the @xmath15 , which decays into @xmath16 ) .",
    "they decay weakly , with a mean free path @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "a hypernucleus is a bound system of neutrons , protons and one or more hyperons .",
    "we will denote with @xmath19 a hypernucleus with @xmath20 protons , @xmath21 neutrons and a hyperon @xmath22 . a crucial point to describe the structure of these _ strange nuclei _",
    "is the knowledge of the elementary hyperon  nucleon ( @xmath23 ) and hyperon  hyperon ( @xmath24 ) interactions .",
    "hyperon masses differ remarkably from the nucleonic mass , hence the flavour @xmath25 symmetry is broken .",
    "the amount of this breaking is a fundamental question in order to understand the baryon ",
    "baryon interaction in the strange sector .    among hyperons and nucleons",
    "the following esoenergetic strong reactions ( @xmath26 ) are allowed : @xmath27 ( in parentheses are quoted the average released energies , the so  called @xmath28values ) , hence , only the lightest hyperon ( @xmath10 ) is generally stable with respect to the strong processes which occur in nuclear systems . in this review",
    "we shall be mainly concerned with @xmath0hypernuclei .",
    "the existence of hypernuclei is interesting since it gives a new dimension to the traditional world of nuclei ( states with new symmetries , selection rules , etc ) .",
    "in fact , they represent the first kind of _ flavoured nuclei _",
    ", in the direction of other exotic systems ( charmed nuclei and so on ) .",
    "hypernuclear physics was born in 1952 , when the first hypernucleus was observed through its decays @xcite . since then",
    ", it has known several phases of development and it has been characterized by more and more new challenging questions and answers . however , this field has experienced great advances only in the last 1015 years .",
    "we can look at hypernuclear physics as a good tool to match nuclear and particle physics .",
    "nowadays , the knowledge of hypernuclear phenomena is rather good , but some open problems still remain .",
    "actually , the study of this field may help in understanding some crucial questions , related , to list a few , to :    * some aspects of the baryon ",
    "baryon weak interactions ; * the @xmath23 and @xmath24 strong interactions in the @xmath29 baryon octet ; * the possible existence of di  baryon particles ; * the renormalization of hyperon and meson properties in the nuclear medium ; * the nuclear structure : for instance , the long standing question of the origin of the spin  orbit interaction and other aspects of the many  body nuclear dynamics ; * the role played by quark degrees of freedom , flavour symmetry and chiral models in nuclear and hypernuclear phenomena .    in this review",
    "we will widely discuss a great deal of these problems .",
    "we summarize here the phenomenological information available nowadays on @xmath23 and @xmath24 interactions and on the structure of @xmath0 , @xmath30 , @xmath12 and @xmath31hypernuclei .",
    "one of the main reasons of interest in hypernuclear physics lies in the characteristics of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 interactions which can be derived from .",
    "obviously , measurements of @xmath23 and @xmath24 cross sections would give more direct information .",
    "however , such experiments are very difficult due to the short lifetime of the hyperons , which gives flight paths limited to less than 10 cm : nowadays , no scattering data are available on the @xmath24 interaction and very limited are the ones for the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 interactions ( especially in the last case ) .",
    "moreover , we remind the reader that the inverse reaction @xmath35 in free space is under investigation at cosy ( jlich ) @xcite and kek @xcite . unfortunately , the experimental observation of this process is difficult because of its very low cross section @xcite with respect to the huge background .",
    "the @xmath36 interaction can be understood in terms of one  meson  exchange ( ome ) models , usually combined with a proper parameterization of the repulsive component at short distance , which originates from quark exchanges between the hadrons and has a range of about @xmath37 fm , corresponding to a transferred momentum @xmath38 mev .",
    "the extension of the ome description to strange particles of the @xmath29 baryon octet is still unsatisfactory .",
    "several models of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 interactions are available .",
    "for instance , with the help of the flavour @xmath25 symmetry , the bonn ",
    "jlich @xcite and nijmegen @xcite groups have developed several potentials using the ome picture , also including , in some cases , two  meson  exchange .",
    "in addition to meson  exchange potentials , other groups ( tokyo @xcite , tbingen @xcite and kyoto  niigata @xcite ) use quark cluster models to explain the short range interactions .",
    "unfortunately , none of these potentials is fully satisfactory and there are large discrepancies among the different models ( especially on the spin  isospin dependence ) .",
    "since the data on @xmath23 scattering are very limited ( they consist almost exclusively of spin  averaged cross sections ) , it is impossible to fit the @xmath23 interaction unambiguously : different @xmath23 potentials can reproduce the data equally well , but they exhibit differences on a more detailed level , especially when the spin structure is concerned ( compare for example refs .",
    "the measurement of spin observables in the @xmath23 scattering as well as in the weak process @xmath39 could discriminate among the various interaction models . on the other hand , the study of the hypernuclear structure and weak decays is helpful in order to get useful information on the @xmath23 and @xmath24 interactions .",
    "the strong @xmath32 interaction displays some different aspects with respect to the @xmath36 one .",
    "for instance , due to isospin conservation in strong interactions , the fact that the @xmath10 has isospin @xmath40 forbids the emission of a pion ( @xmath41 ) . in figure [ potln ]",
    "we depict the @xmath36 and @xmath32 strong potentials in the ome model .",
    "the strong @xmath42 and @xmath43 couplings are allowed , and the @xmath0 hyperon can interact with a nucleon by exchanging an even number of pions and/or of @xmath44 mesons ( see figure  [ pipi ] ) .",
    "the dominant part of the @xmath32 interaction comes from the two  pion  exchange , hence it has a shorter range than the @xmath36 one .",
    "moreover , the @xmath32 potential is weaker than the @xmath36 potential : roughly speaking , from the diagrams of figures  [ potln ] and [ pipi ] , for the tensorial components we have : @xmath45 .",
    "besides , three  body interactions and two  body interactions with strangeness exchange are also allowed ( figure  [ kappa ] ) .",
    "the @xmath46 three  body force , whose pionic component is depicted in fig .  [ kappa](a ) , is an important ingredient to investigate the structure of @xmath0hypernuclei @xcite , especially in light systems .",
    "this is due to the @xmath32@xmath33 strong coupling , which is sizeable in the nuclear medium @xcite , and , on the other hand , leads to a non ",
    "negligible second order tensor force in the @xmath32 interaction ( fig .",
    "[ pipi ] ) . by assuming a repulsive @xmath46 potential ,",
    "the small @xmath0 binding energies in light hypernuclei and the depth of the @xmath0nucleus mean potential for heavy systems can be reproduced @xcite without requiring a strong spin  dependence of the @xmath32 interaction ; the latter seems , at present , to be excluded ( see following discussion in this paragraph ) . in particular , the @xmath46 interaction is essential to explain the existence of the lightest hypernucleus , the hypertriton ( @xmath47h@xmath48 ) , which is weakly bound .",
    "the @xmath0 binding energy , defined as : @xmath49 is as small as @xmath50 kev in hypertriton . in ref .",
    "@xcite , within a microscopic many  body scheme , the authors showed how the coupling to intermediate @xmath33 states in the @xmath32 interaction ( figure  [ pipi ] ) is crucial for a correct evaluation of the @xmath0 binding energy in nuclear matter . in hypernuclei",
    "the @xmath32@xmath33 coupling is more important [ especially because of the relatively small @xmath0@xmath30 mass difference ( @xmath51 mev ) ] than the @xmath36@xmath52 coupling in conventional nuclei , where the latter plays a very small role in binding few ",
    "nucleon systems ( @xmath53 mev ) .",
    "another signal of the @xmath32@xmath33 coupling comes from the observation that in @xmath54wave relative states the @xmath55 interaction is more attractive than the @xmath56 interaction .",
    "this follows from a comparison of the experimental @xmath0 binding energies in the @xmath57 , @xmath58 doublet : @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 should differ only because of coulomb effects , if the @xmath56 and @xmath55 interactions were of equal strength ) .",
    "the @xmath32@xmath33 coupling gives a charge symmetry breaking more important than the one observed in ordinary nuclei by comparing the neutron separation energies in @xmath62h and @xmath62he ( after correcting for the coulomb interaction in @xmath62he ) .",
    "the coulomb energy in @xmath63he is expected to be only a little more repulsive than in @xmath62he : @xmath64 mev .",
    "large part of the charge symmetry breaking observed in light @xmath0hypernuclei is due to the coupling between the @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels and turns out to be quite sensitive to the mass difference between the initial and final state : @xmath65 ( for transitions without charge exchange , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 mev ) .",
    "another important aspect of the @xmath32 interaction is its spin  dependence .",
    "a qualitative indication of the difference between the singlet ( @xmath69 ) and triplet ( @xmath70 ) @xmath32 interactions comes from the comparison of the @xmath0 binding energy in isobar nuclei not related by charge symmetry .",
    "for example , @xmath71 is larger than @xmath72 by about @xmath73 mev .",
    "the greater @xmath74 value corresponds to the hypernucleus whose nucleons core has non  zero spin ( being an odd  odd system , while the core of @xmath75be is even  even ) ; it can be explained by the effect of the spin ",
    "dependent @xmath0 interaction with the unpaired nucleons , a proton and a neutron , in @xmath75li .",
    "however , the @xmath32 spin ",
    "spin interaction is weak . in ref @xcite the @xmath0core spin doublet splittings ( @xmath76 ) , which give the strength of the @xmath32 spin ",
    "spin interaction , are predicted to be of the order of @xmath77 mev for @xmath8shell hypernuclei , and only for @xmath78li in the ground state this splitting is sizeably larger ( @xmath79 mev ) .",
    "the recent measurements , at kek and bnl @xcite , of the energy spacing of the @xmath75li ground state doublet , @xmath80 kev , and of various @xmath81ray transitions in other @xmath8shell hypernuclei confirmed this prediction @xcite . experiments with high energy resolution are then essential to study the spin  dependence of the @xmath32 interaction . from the analysis of the spins of ground and excited states in @xmath0hypernuclei one expects the @xmath32 interaction to be more attractive in the spin",
    " singlet state than in the spin  triplet state @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors found that the quark cluster model gives more attraction in the triplet interaction ; moreover , their meson  exchange potentials are almost spin  independent . in the phenomenological ome models of the @xmath32 interaction",
    "the situation is not clear @xcite : since there is no direct empirical information about the spin structure of the potential , some versions favour the singlet interaction , while others favour the triplet one .",
    "it has been found @xcite that the @xmath32 effective interaction has repulsive character in the spin ",
    "parity @xmath82 channel , while for the @xmath36 interaction an attractive @xmath83 pairing is well known .",
    "this anti  pairing effect originates from a delicate balance between the @xmath32 inner repulsion and the attraction at intermediate distances .",
    "the spin  orbit component of the @xmath0nucleus mean potential is rather small .",
    "the spin  orbit separation of the @xmath0 levels is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the one typical of the @xmath84nucleus interaction @xcite .",
    "such effect could originate from the weak tensor component of the @xmath32 interaction , whose most important contributions come from the exchange , forbidden at the lowest order , of pions and rhos .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the strong one  body spin ",
    "orbit potential experienced in ordinary nuclei ( central point in order to explain their exact shell structure ) originates from a two  body tensor force .",
    "however this point is not completely clear yet .",
    "in fact , forces besides the spin  orbit one @xcite as well as core excitations @xcite may contribute to the observed splittings as well .",
    "we will further discuss the problem of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction in @xmath0hypernuclei in the next section .",
    "when a hyperon is embedded in the nucleus , one has to take into account the influence of the medium on the hyperon .",
    "a simple mean field picture turns out to be a good description of the bulk hypernuclear properties @xcite ( for example the hyperons binding energies and the excitation functions ) . within this approximation",
    "the hyperon maintains its single particle behaviour in the medium , and it is well known that this occurs even for states well below the fermi surface @xcite , a property which is not observed for the nucleons .",
    "this is due to the fact that in hypernuclei the @xmath0 is a distinguishable particle , which weakly interacts with the nucleons core .",
    "however , deviations from the independent particle description can be produced , for instance , by three  body forces , @xmath32@xmath33 and @xmath31@xmath34 couplings , qcd effects at the nuclear level and non  localities due to relativistic effects .    on the other hand , the presence of a hyperon influences the nuclear medium : hence , the hartree ",
    "fock approximation acquires a new self  consistency requirement in strange nuclei . in spite of the relative weakness of the @xmath32 interaction ( with respect to the @xmath36 interaction ) , for particular nucleon configurations",
    "the single particle levels may be considerably lowered by the presence of a @xmath0 : for the deepest ones the energy shift can reach @xmath85 mev , while for the valence orbits a value of about @xmath86 mev is frequent @xcite .",
    "for example , the extra @xmath87 neutron binding energy for a @xmath8shell hypernucleus @xmath88z due to the addition of the @xmath0 to the nucleus @xmath89z is calculable with the following relation : @xmath90 for a @xmath91 neutron : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the mass of the @xmath91 neutron  hole excited state of @xmath94 , which can be produced by the @xmath95 reaction on @xmath96 , through the transformation of a @xmath91 neutron into a @xmath91 @xmath0hyperon ( see next section ) .",
    "similar relations hold for the proton levels .",
    "the stability of the nucleons core is increased by the presence of the @xmath0 particle , which plays then a `` glue  like '' role .",
    "remarkable examples are @xmath97he and @xmath98be vs @xmath99he and @xmath100be , the former being unstable and the latter stable with respect to strong particle emission .",
    "very recent @xmath81ray spectroscopy experiment at kek @xcite showed that the size of the @xmath101li core in @xmath75li is reduced with respect to that of the loosely bound @xmath101li nucleus . in a @xmath102he@xmath103 ( @xmath104he@xmath103 ) cluster model for @xmath75li ( @xmath101li )",
    "@xcite , the rms distance between @xmath102he and @xmath103 in @xmath75li is about 19% smaller than the one between @xmath104he and @xmath103 in @xmath101li .",
    "the role of stabilizer of the @xmath0 in nuclei is due to its position in the inner part of the nucleons core , on single particle levels which are forbidden , by the pauli principle , to the nucleons . on the other hand",
    ", the weak decay of the @xmath0 may cause the delayed fission of the host nucleus ( because of the decreased stability and energy release of the decay ) .",
    "this process has been used to measure the lifetime of heavy hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "we consider now the different behaviours , in nuclei , of neutron and @xmath0 due to their decay modes . in the free space neutron and @xmath0",
    "are unstable ; they decay through the following weak channels : @xmath105 the energy released in the neutron free decay is @xmath106 mev , while the binding energy of a nucleon in the nucleus is ( in the average ) @xmath107 mev , therefore a neutron in a nucleus is generally stable ( namely its decay is kinematically forbidden ) . on the other hand , for the @xmath0 free decay",
    "the released energy is @xmath108 mev .",
    "this is larger than the nuclear @xmath0 separation energy : @xmath109 mev ( especially in light hypernuclei ) , hence the @xmath0 is kinematically unstable even if embedded in nuclear systems .",
    "the binding energies of nucleon and @xmath0 in nuclei , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , have different behaviours as a function of the mass number : @xmath110 saturates at about @xmath112 mev for nuclei with @xmath113 , while @xmath74 monotonically increases with @xmath114 up to @xmath115 mev for @xmath116pb . indeed ,",
    "the @xmath0 can occupy whatever single particle state , the ground state of the hypernucleus always corresponding to the hyperon in the @xmath91 level .",
    "it is then clear that a @xmath0 particle is a good probe of the inner part of nuclei .",
    "actually , the pauli principle is active on the @xmath117 and @xmath103 quarks of nucleons and @xmath0 when they are very close to each other .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath102he@xmath118 , if the constituent baryons maintain their identity , both the hyperon and the nucleons occupy @xmath9 levels , while at the quark level an _ up _ quark in the @xmath55 short range interaction ( and a _ down _ quark in @xmath56 ) has to occupy the @xmath8level .",
    "the pauli blocking effect at the quark level could be an important ingredient to explain the anomalously small @xmath102he binding energy with respect to calculations performed within the baryon picture .",
    "a study of the role played by the quark pauli principle on the binding energies of single and double@xmath0 @xmath9shell hypernuclei can be found in ref .",
    "the authors have found significant effects when the assumed size of the baryons is of the order of the proton charge radius : @xmath119 fm .    with the exception of hypernuclei of the @xmath9shell , the depth of the @xmath0nucleus mean field is of about @xmath120 mev @xcite , namely it is less attractive than the one typical for a nucleon ( @xmath121 mev ) .",
    "this characteristic reflects the smaller range and the weakness of the @xmath32 interaction at intermediate distances with respect to the @xmath36 one .",
    "it is possible to reproduce the experimental single particle @xmath0 levels using woods ",
    "saxon wells with the above depth and appropriate radii . for @xmath9shell",
    "hypernuclei the @xmath0 single particle potential displays a repulsive soft core at short distances @xcite .",
    "a measure of this effect is given by the rms radii for a nucleon and a @xmath0 in these hypernuclei : the hyperon rms radius is larger than the one for a nucleon .",
    "the investigation of the @xmath33 interaction is richer but more difficult than that of the @xmath32 interaction .",
    "we remind the reader that it exhibits a long range ope component , its central part is weaker than the @xmath32 one and it is very sensitive to spin and isospin @xcite . very roughly , the strengths of the averaged @xmath36 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 potentials are in the following ratios : @xmath122 , @xmath123 . the strong spin ",
    "isospin dependence in the @xmath33 interaction is natural in ome models and it is due to the exchange of both isoscalar ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) and isovector mesons ( @xmath126 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 spin  orbit strength is expected to be about @xmath127 times the @xmath36 one @xcite . calculations and experimental observations have shown that both the @xmath32 and @xmath33 effective potentials are strongly repulsive at short distances , and a repulsive core even remains in the @xmath0@xmath128 and @xmath129@xmath128 folding potentials @xcite ( which describe the @xmath0 and @xmath30 dynamics in @xmath102he and @xmath130he , respectively ) ; however , differently from @xmath102he ( @xmath131 mev ) , because of the large repulsion in the inner region , the @xmath129@xmath128 potential does not support bound states .",
    "on the contrary , for the @xmath36 interaction the attraction at intermediate distances is so strong that the @xmath84@xmath128 potential obtained by the folding procedure does not contain the inner repulsive component . for heavy nuclei",
    "a repulsive bump could appear on the surface of the @xmath30nucleus potential because of the particular balance of repulsion and attraction ( which is less effective on the nuclear surface ) in the @xmath33 interaction @xcite .",
    "the first production signals interpreted as @xmath30hypernuclear states , 20 years ago at cern , showed unexpected narrow peaks ( less than @xmath132 mev , instead of the @xmath133 mev estimated for nuclear matter @xcite ) which were assigned to the formation of @xmath134be , @xmath135c , @xmath135be and @xmath136c @xcite .",
    "the first observation reported two narrow peaks above the @xmath30 binding threshold separated by about @xmath137 mev in the @xmath138be@xmath139 strong reaction and were ascribed to the formation of @xmath140be .",
    "however , the measurements were carried out with very low statistics and the identification of the peaks involved large ambiguities . moreover",
    ", none of the reported states could be assigned to hypernuclear ground states .",
    "recently , at bnl ",
    "ags @xcite , by employing ten times better statistic , the existence of such narrow structures for @xmath8shell hypernuclei has been excluded . due to the relevance of the @xmath32@xmath33 coupling , @xmath30hypernuclei",
    "can also be regarded as resonant states of @xmath0hypernuclei . on the other hand , in a @xmath30hypernucleus",
    "the @xmath141 conversion creates a @xmath0 with a kinetic energy of about @xmath142 mev .",
    "since the @xmath0nucleus well depth is smaller than this energy , the @xmath0hyperon has a thick probability to escape from the nucleus and decays after @xmath143 cm . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the existence of narrow @xmath30 state in nuclei can not be explained only in the ( plausible ) hypothesis of a sizeable @xmath141 strong converting process . among the mechanisms introduced in order to suppress the calculated widths of @xmath30hypernuclei @xcite , the most relevant ones are the pauli blocking effect on the final nucleon in @xmath141 , the suppression of particular spin  isospin transitions and the medium polarization effect .",
    "the latter is accounted for in @xcite through the so  called _ induced interaction approach_. moreover , it is also possible that the @xmath144 conversion is less efficient in finite nuclei because the @xmath30nucleus potential has such a small depth that the @xmath30 wave function is considerably pushed out of the nucleus .",
    "as already pointed out , it has been established that for @xmath9shell @xmath30hypernuclei the hyperon is pushed towards the nuclear surface by a central repulsion in the @xmath30nucleus potential .",
    "the above effects can reduce the @xmath141 width up to @xmath145 mev in @xmath8shell hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "there are many ambiguities in our knowledge of the properties of the @xmath30nucleus potential , as obtained from hypernuclear and @xmath33 scattering data studies .",
    "if this potential had small depth , in the production of heavy systems there should be the problem of resolving the small spacing among the single particle levels .",
    "in fact , if the energy separation among the @xmath30levels is lower than their widths , these states can not be resolved by the experiment .",
    "the analysis of the few existing data on @xmath146atoms and of @xmath147 production indicate @xcite a @xmath30 single particle potential depth in the range @xmath148 mev for hypernuclei beyond the @xmath9shell .",
    "very shallow depths ( @xmath149 mev ) are consistent with the @xmath147 analysis , which , in fact , has not proved the existence of @xmath30 nuclear states beyond the @xmath9shell . instead , @xmath150 mev is more consistent with @xmath30atoms data , which , however , are not sensitive to the interior part of the nucleus : hence , @xmath151 mev overestimates @xmath152 .",
    "moreover , from the above cited analysis , the @xmath30nucleus potential turns out to be strongly spin and isospin  dependent , with a spin  orbit part comparable with the @xmath84nucleus one . from further theoretical speculations",
    "@xcite and experiments carried out in the last years at kek @xcite and bnl @xcite , the existence of @xmath30 bound states for nuclear mass numbers @xmath153 seems to be strongly unlikely . on the other hand , the existence of the predicted @xcite @xmath154he bound state has been proved ( with binding energy @xmath155 mev and width @xmath156 mev ) both at kek @xcite and bnl @xcite",
    "actually , only for very light systems the widths are expected to be narrower than the separation among the @xmath30levels ; moreover , for hypernuclei other than the @xmath9shell ones , the @xmath30nucleus potential could not be deep enough to accommodate @xmath30 bound states .",
    "other investigations support the presence of a substantial repulsive component in the @xmath30nucleus potential also in medium and heavy hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "it is then clear that further experiments and theoretical work are needed to properly understand the existence of @xmath30hypernuclei .",
    "some experiments have revealed the existence of @xmath12hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "they are produced through the @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 strong reactions , which , because of the relatively large momentum transferred ( @xmath162 mev ) , preferentially excite high total spin hypernuclear states .",
    "the measured @xmath91 @xmath163 binding energies ( old emulsion data ) have been fitted by using a woods  saxon potential with radius @xmath164 fm , depth @xmath165 mev and surface diffuseness @xmath166 fm @xcite .",
    "the depth @xmath167 compares well with theoretical predictions based on nijmegen ome models and allows for the binding of several @xmath12 levels .",
    "more recent speculations favour smaller well depths , around @xmath168 mev @xcite for @xmath169c and @xmath169be",
    ". however , improved experiments are needed to extract precise information concerning the @xmath12nucleus potential @xcite ; for example it is not yet clear whether the potential depth exhibit a mass number dependence @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a @xmath163@xmath128 potential characterized by a quite strong inner repulsion and a shallow attraction at intermediate distances : the @xmath163 wave function is pushed on the nuclear surface and the small @xmath163 binding energy has been reproduced .",
    "they have also found that in the formation of @xmath170he an important role is played by the coulomb interaction .",
    "when a @xmath163hypernucleus ( or a @xmath163atom ) is formed , the hyperon strongly interacts with a nucleon of the medium ( exchanging a strange meson , @xmath171 or @xmath172 ) and produces two @xmath0 s with an energy release of only @xmath173 mev ( further reduced by binding effects ) : @xmath174 .",
    "this offers the possibility of producing double@xmath0hypernuclei @xcite , which were observed for the first time during the 60 s in emulsion experiments .",
    "the formation probability of a @xmath31hypernucleus is sizeable because the @xmath173 mev energy release in @xmath174 is only @xmath77 % larger than the separation energy in an @xmath128particle .",
    "therefore , if an @xmath128cluster is broken as a consequence of the @xmath163 absorption , the final @xmath0 s will not have enough energy to escape from the nucleus .",
    "the production probability of a double@xmath0 or twin@xmath0 hypernucleus turned out to be @xmath175% in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , which used @xmath163 atomic capture on @xmath176c .",
    "the strangeness @xmath157 hypernuclei are quite interesting because they represent the unique way of getting information on the @xmath34 and @xmath31 interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the conversion width due to the process @xmath174 has been estimated to be quite narrow ( of the order of @xmath177 mev or less ) , as one expects because of the small energy released in the process .",
    "more recent calculations have found conversion widths narrower than the spacing among the @xmath12 levels : typically @xmath178 mev for @xmath9states and @xmath179 mev for @xmath8states @xcite . for @xmath180he the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a very small width , @xmath181 mev , which results from a small overlap between the @xmath163 wave function and the nuclear core ( the @xmath163 binding energy being only @xmath182 mev ) . therefore ,",
    "if the experimental energy resolution is good enough , the smallness of @xmath183 makes it feasible to perform spectroscopic studies . because of the small mass difference between initial and final states , the @xmath31@xmath34 coupling plays an important role in double @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "however , a suppression of this coupling coming from the pauli blocking on the nucleon becomes sizeable in medium  heavy hypernuclei . on the contrary",
    ", the @xmath31@xmath184 strong coupling will be less important for the large mass difference ( @xmath185 mev ) .",
    "the study of @xmath12 and @xmath31hypernuclei is closely related to the observation of hyperon mixed states due to the @xmath31@xmath34@xmath184 couplings @xcite and , in particular , to the search for a stable @xmath158particle .",
    "the latter is predicted to be a six quark state containing two @xmath117 , two @xmath103 and two @xmath9 quarks coupled into a singlet @xmath25 state of both colour and flavour : it should have @xmath82 , @xmath40 and it should be stable against strong decays ( obviously , if its mass is smaller than twice the @xmath0 mass ) .",
    "this object has baryonic number 2 but it is not an ordinary nuclear state , namely the three quark clusters contained in @xmath158 are deconfined .",
    "this kind of di  baryon was predicted by jaffe in 1977 @xcite within a quark bag model .",
    "nowadays , searching experiments are running @xcite . from observations on double@xmath0hypernuclei ,",
    "the expected mass is @xmath186 mev @xcite .",
    "the first calculation by jaffe found a large value for @xmath187 ( @xmath188 mev ) . should the binding energy of the @xmath158dibaryon be more attractive than the binding energy of two @xmath0 s in nuclei , @xmath189 , then the di ",
    "baryon should be strongly emitted from the nucleus ( @xmath190 ) , and the hypernucleus would have a very short lifetime . on the contrary , if @xmath191 , successive decays of the two hyperons ( weak processes ) should be observed , but this would not necessarily imply the non  existence of the @xmath158 di  baryon : the @xmath31 interaction could also be attractive , although weaker than @xmath192 .",
    "it is then clear that , in this sense , the stability of double@xmath0 hypernuclei may hinder the experimental detection of the @xmath158particle : the observation of the weak decay of a double@xmath0 hypernucleus only excludes the @xmath158 mass in the region @xmath193 . from the present experimental searches there is no unambiguous evidence which supports the existence of di  baryon resonances in the strange sector .",
    "studies of the @xmath31 contribution to the experimental binding energy @xmath192 are quite difficult because of the few data available on double@xmath0 hypernuclei and of the density dependence of the @xmath31 interaction ( @xmath31@xmath34 coupling , three body forces , etc ) .",
    "this interaction occurs by the exchange of @xmath40 mesons at lowest order , which favours an attractive character for @xmath194 .",
    "nuclear emulsion experiments reported the observation of three double@xmath0 hypernuclei : @xmath195he , @xmath196be and @xmath197b . from these events ,",
    "an effective @xmath31 matrix element @xmath198 being the separation energy of the @xmath0 pair from the @xmath199z hypernucleus and @xmath200 the hyperon separation energy from the @xmath88z hypernucleus .",
    "however , a very recent counter  emulsion hybrid experiment , performed at kek @xcite , favours a quite weaker @xmath31 interaction : @xmath201 mev .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite advanced the hypothesis that in the previous emulsion experiments , the single@xmath0 hypernuclei were produced in excited states . in this case , a value of @xmath202 around 1 mev is expected also from these experiments . the production of @xmath203h hypernuclei has been reported , very recently , in a counter experiment at bnl @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the limited statistics , the authors have not determined @xmath202 .",
    "the quantity @xmath202 , called @xmath31 bond energy , is expected to decrease as the nuclear mass number @xmath114 increases and goes to zero in the limit @xmath204 : for increasing @xmath114 the attraction between the @xmath0 s becomes weaker because of the larger @xmath31 average distance .",
    "we note here that in ref .",
    "@xcite the author , by using the skyrme  hartree  fock approach , found the approximation @xmath205 between @xmath31 interaction strength and bond energy to be questionable .",
    "indeed these quantities seem to be sizeably affected by the interplay of several factors , such as the spatial distributions of the @xmath0 s and the core polarization : for @xmath197b the author evaluated @xmath206 mev ( depending on the various parameterizations used for the @xmath31 skyrme potential ) once the @xmath31 potential was adjusted to reproduce the value @xmath207 mev of the old emulsion experiment . in a double@xmath0 hypernucleus the two hyperons are in the @xmath208 relative state ( the @xmath209 is not allowed by pauli principle ) .",
    "we can then compare the @xmath31 interaction matrix elements with the @xmath208 ones for @xmath56 and neutron  neutron interactions in light systems : @xmath210 mev , @xmath211 mev .",
    "we know that the @xmath208 @xmath212 system is not bound .",
    "however , a @xmath208 @xmath31 bound system , which has a smaller matrix element than @xmath212 , can not be excluded on this basis because of the unknown balance between the short range repulsion and the intermediate distance attraction in the @xmath31 interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "also the @xmath31@xmath34 coupling must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath192 in medium and heavy double@xmath0hypernuclei are expected , too .",
    "we conclude this section by recalling that hypernuclei are always unstable with respect to weak decay .",
    "a variety of processes are in principle accessible ( which do not have counterpart in the non  strange sector ) . limiting ourself to @xmath213 transitions we have :    * for @xmath0hypernuclei : @xmath214 * for @xmath30hypernuclei : @xmath215 * for @xmath12hypernuclei : @xmath216 * for @xmath31hypernuclei : @xmath217 * and many other processes for multi strangeness systems ( @xmath218 ) , for example : @xmath219    these decays are expected to have lifetimes of the order of @xmath14 sec or less . however , when hyperons other than the @xmath0 are embedded in a nucleus , strong processes , which have very short lifetimes ( @xmath220 sec ) , dominate over the quoted weak decays , preventing them to occur . for double@xmath0 hypernuclei ,",
    "the @xmath0induced weak decay rates [ eq .  ( [ lamlam ] ) ] of @xmath9shell systems are estimated @xcite to be suppressed by a factor @xmath221 with respect to the free @xmath0 width , and are impossible to detect at present .",
    "the new development ( in the last 15 years ) of counter experiments have opened a new phase of hypernuclear physics .",
    "in fact , the old experiments in the 60 s used emulsion and bubble chamber techniques and , practically , they only measured the hyperons binding energies . through counter techniques , the experiments have discovered new and interesting features of the hypernuclear structure , although several questions still remain unsolved .",
    "hypernuclei can be produced by using strong processes in which a particle ( generally a pion or a kaon ) hits a nucleus .",
    "since strangeness has to be conserved , one can use the following production reactions :    1 .",
    "processes with strangeness exchange : @xmath222 2 .",
    "processes with associated production of strange hadrons : @xmath223 3 .",
    "reactions in which strangeness exchange and associated production of strangeness are combined ( used for the production of @xmath224 hypernuclei ) : @xmath225    in the following , we denote with @xmath226 , or simply with @xmath227 , the process : @xmath228 where @xmath84 is a nucleon and @xmath22 a hyperon .",
    "the considered reactions have different characteristics depending on their kinematics . in the following we shall see that , because of the complementarity of the reactions , the combined use of various production modes is important for exhaustive spectroscopic studies .    in order to produce a hypernucleus , the hyperon emerging from the reaction has to remain inside the nuclear system .",
    "the formation probability of a hypernucleus depends on the energy transferred in the production .",
    "when the momentum transferred to the hyperon , @xmath229 , is much larger than the nuclear fermi momentum @xmath230 , the hyperon has a very small _ sticking probability _ and it leaves the nucleus .",
    "instead , when @xmath231 , the hyperon is created , with a high probability , in a bound state . in figure  [ momtrans ] are shown the momenta transferred to the hyperon @xmath22 in the reactions @xmath226 as a function of the projectile momentum @xmath232 at @xmath233 in the laboratory frame .    with the exception of the @xmath147 reactions , the other ones reported in the figure are endoenergetic , therefore the hyperon can not be produced at rest : @xmath229 decreases as the projectile momentum increases but it remains finite for high @xmath232 .",
    "in this situation the hyperon is produced with a non  negligible probability above its emission threshold , namely with @xmath234 ( quasi  free production ) .",
    "some hypernuclear states in the continuum may be quasi  bound state",
    ": they do not emit the hyperon but nucleons and/or cluster of nucleons .      in the @xmath147",
    "production reactions the incident @xmath235 transforms the struck neutron ( proton ) into a @xmath0 or @xmath129 ( @xmath146 ) and a @xmath236 ( @xmath237 ) is emitted with an energy spectrum which is directly related to the populated hypernuclear level .",
    "the reactions @xmath238 , @xmath239 ( used for the first time at cern @xcite and bnl @xcite to produce @xmath0 and @xmath30hypernuclei ) are esoenergetic and can create the hyperon at rest ( @xmath240 ) . by considering , as an approximation , the initial neutron in @xmath238 at rest",
    ", the transferred momentum is zero , @xmath241 , and the pion is emitted at @xmath242 in the laboratory frame .",
    "thus , from energy ",
    "momentum conservation : @xmath243 and the momentum for the production of the @xmath0 at rest ( called magic momentum ) can be derived as follows : @xmath244 if the production reaction is @xmath239 , the kaon magic momentum is @xmath245 mev .    since both the initial @xmath235 and the final pion",
    "are strongly absorbed in the nucleus ( they have a small mean free path ) , the kaon induced reactions preferentially populate less bound @xmath0levels and they have been only employed for @xmath9 and @xmath8shell hypernuclear studies . moreover , the low intensity and poor resolution of the kaon beams hinder the use of the @xmath147 reactions .    by using the strangeness exchange reaction at @xmath242 , the hyperon is predominantly produced in a state with the same quantum numbers of the struck nucleon , namely the neutron hole and the @xmath0 are coupled to @xmath82 and @xmath246 ( substitutional reaction ) . by increasing @xmath247 the relative importance of @xmath248 etc transitions increases , and hypernuclear states with higher spin can be produced . from measures at both @xmath249 and @xmath250",
    "it has been possible to study a large part of the level structure of light hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies with the reaction @xmath238 in a few hypernuclei ( @xmath251c , @xmath252o and others ) have shown that the spin ",
    "orbit part of the @xmath0nucleus mean potential is very small compared to the one of a nucleon @xcite , although the exact magnitude is not known yet .",
    "taken , for instance , the case of @xmath252o , the measured @xmath0 and nucleon @xmath253 spin  orbit shifts are @xcite : @xmath254 this estimate comes from the observed peaks in the excitation spectrum , which are reported in table  [ spinorb ] with the relative @xmath255 configurations .",
    "we see that the @xmath253 spin  orbit separation for the nucleon is obtained by subtracting the energies of peaks # 3 and # 4 . from the observation that almost the same separation exists between the peaks # 1 and # 2 , we can infer that the analogous spin  orbit separation for the @xmath0 is compatible with zero .",
    "subsequent @xmath256 experiments have confirmed small @xmath0 spin  orbit splittings .",
    "very recently , the hyperon @xmath257 splitting of @xmath251c hypernuclei , produced by the @xmath258c reaction , has been measured at bnl @xcite , with the result : @xmath259 to our best knowledge , only the analysis of dalitz _ et al . _",

    "sasaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained a lower asymmetry in the @xmath269 calculation with respect to the pure ope value . however",
    "the ome and @xmath270dq results of the two calculations agree with each another , with values around @xmath271 . at variance with the above discussed results ,",
    "the calculation of ramos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite supplies practically the same asymmetry in the ope and @xmath269 models .",
    "the origin of these discrepancies is unknown : the difference among the various ope calculations are due to the use of different @xmath272 form factors and short range correlations for the initial @xmath55 and final @xmath273 states .    in conclusion ,",
    "further investigations are required to clarify the situation : on the theoretical side there seems to be no way ( even by forcing the model parameters to unrealistic values ) to obtain positive asymmetry values @xcite ; on the experimental side the present anomalous discrepancy between different data needs to be resolved .",
    "it has been advanced the hypothesis that the asymmetry puzzle could have the same origin of the previously discussed puzzle on the @xmath4 ratio @xcite . at present",
    "there is no firm evidence of this relation .",
    "indeed , the situation is even more confused for the asymmetry than for the @xmath4 ratio : in the former case , the experiments can not provide any guidance for new theoretical speculations .",
    "we hope that future experimental studies of the inverse reaction @xmath274 in free space could help in disentangling the puzzling situation .",
    "indeed , the weak production of the @xmath0hyperon through the scattering of longitudinally polarized protons on neutron targets can give a richer and cleaner ( with respect to the non  mesonic hypernuclear decay ) piece of information on the @xmath0 polarization ",
    "observables @xcite .",
    "in this review we have discussed the present status of hypernuclear physics . beyond an extensive and updated description of our present understanding of weak hypernuclear decay processes , which are the main topic of the paper ,",
    "we have also illustrated some phenomenological aspects of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 interaction and the hypernuclear structure and reviewed the reactions which are used to produce hypernuclei .",
    "measurements of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 cross sections are very difficult to perform , because of the very short lifetimes of hyperons . as a consequence , the various phenomenological models developed to describe these interactions are not completely satisfactory .",
    "one of the major reason of interest on hypernuclear phenomena lies thus in the information which can be extracted about the @xmath23 and @xmath24 interactions ( both of strong and weak nature , the former being relevant for hypernuclear structure studies and the latter for hypernuclear weak decays ) .",
    "further , we have introduced the weak decay modes of @xmath0hypernuclei : beyond the mesonic channel , which is observed also for a free @xmath0 , the hypernuclear decay proceeds through non ",
    "mesonic processes , mainly induced by one nucleon or by a pair of correlated nucleons .",
    "this channel is the dominant one in medium ",
    "heavy hypernuclei , where the pauli principle strongly suppresses the mesonic decay .",
    "the results obtained within the various models proposed to describe the mesonic and non  mesonic decay rates as well as the asymmetry parameters in the decay of the @xmath0hyperon in nuclei have been thoroughly discussed .",
    "the mesonic rates have been reproduced quite well by calculations performed in different frameworks .",
    "the non  mesonic rates have been considered within a variety of phenomenological and microscopic models , most of them being based on the exchange of a pion between the decaying @xmath0 and the nucleon(s ) .",
    "more complex meson exchange potentials , as well as direct quark models have also been considered for the evaluation of non  mesonic decay rates . in this context",
    ", particular interest has been devoted to the partial rates @xmath275 and @xmath276 and to their ratio .    in spite of the fact that several calculations have been able to reproduce , already at the ope level , the total non  mesonic width , @xmath277 , the values therewith obtained for @xmath4 reveal a strong disagreement with the measured central data",
    "actually , due to the large experimental uncertainties involved in the extraction of @xmath4 , at present one can not draw definite conclusions , and different and more refined experimental analysis are required to correct for eventual deficiencies of the models .    notably , the non  mesonic partial rates @xmath275 and @xmath276 are dominated by parity  conserving transition amplitudes .",
    "the asymmetric emission of protons from proton  induced non  mesonic decays of polarized hypernuclei is related to the interference between the parity  conserving and parity  violating transition amplitudes to @xmath36 states with the same intrinsic spin @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the study of the decay asymmetries complements the one of the non  mesonic partial rates , providing , at least in principle , new constraints on the @xmath278 decay mechanism .",
    "nuclear structure uncertainties are under control , and can not influence very much the calculation of the hypernuclear observables for the non  mesonic decay . the total non  mesonic widths turn out to be relatively insensitive to the details of the weak interaction model . on the contrary , the ratio @xmath4 strongly depends on the decay mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , the ome calculations , including the exchange of mesons more massive than the pion such as the @xmath44 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , as well as the ( correlated or uncorrelated ) two  pion exchange models can not improve the comparison with the experimental @xmath4 ratios and decay asymmetries .",
    "these evaluations are rather sensitive to the models used for the required meson  baryon  baryon strong and weak vertexes .",
    "however , only by using rather unrealistic coupling constants it is possible to fit , simultaneously , the data on @xmath279 and @xmath4 for different hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the ope mechanism alone is able to reproduce the observed total non  mesonic widths , but strongly underestimates ( by about one order of magnitude ) the central data for the ratio .",
    "only the @xmath171meson  exchange turned out to be important to obtain considerably larger @xmath4 ratios , but the central data remains underestimated .",
    "the inclusion in the non  mesonic transition potential of quark degrees of freedom suffers from large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the models that implemented direct quark interactions in ome calculations found @xmath4 values considerably larger than the ope estimates , also as a result of the @xmath171meson exchange , but problems remains in reproducing both the ratio and @xmath279 for the considered systems .",
    "although some of the discussed improvements could represent a step forward in the solution of the @xmath280 puzzle , further efforts ( especially on the experimental side ) must be invested in order to understand the detailed dynamics of the non  mesonic decay . from the theoretical point of view , it is not easy to imagine new mechanisms as responsible for the large observed ratios",
    ". very recent experiments at kek have considerably reduced the error bars on @xmath280 , by means of _ single _ nucleon spectra measurements .",
    "the new experiments confirmed previous data , with improved accuracy .",
    "however , in order to avoid possible deficiencies of this kind of observations , a direct and unambiguous extraction of the ratio is compulsory .",
    "as widely discussed in the present review , for such a determination good statistics coincidence measurements of the @xmath212 and @xmath273 emitted pairs are required .",
    "these correlation measurements will also allow for the identification of the nucleons which come out from the different one and two  nucleon induced processes .",
    "as far as the asymmetry parameters are concerned , the situation is even more puzzling . indeed , strong inconsistencies already appear at the experimental level : the two existing experiments revealed an opposite sign of the intrinsic asymmetry parameter , @xmath6 , for @xmath267e and @xmath8shell hypernuclei .",
    "this is in strong contradiction with the theoretical expectation of an intrinsic asymmetry which should be , in principle , rather insensitive to nuclear structure effects .",
    "some calculations reproduced the first measurement of @xmath281 , which found a large and negative value for @xmath8shell hypernuclei , but no calculation could obtain a positive value for @xmath267e .",
    "the experiments thus can not provide any guidance for further theoretical evaluations .",
    "improved experiments , establishing with certainty the sign and magnitude of @xmath281 for @xmath9 and @xmath8shell hypernuclei , are then strongly awaited .",
    "we conclude this work by reminding the reader that hypernuclear physics is 49 years old , yet a lot of efforts remain to be done , both experimentally and theoretically , in order to fully understand the hyperon dynamics and decay inside the nuclear medium .",
    "the impressive progress experienced in the last few years is promising and we hope that it deserves a definite answer to the intriguing open questions which we have illustrated here .",

    "<S> in this review we discuss the present status of strange nuclear physics , with special attention to the weak decay of @xmath0hypernuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the models proposed for the evaluation of the @xmath0 decay widths are summarized and their results are compared with the data . </S>",
    "<S> the rates @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are well explained by several calculations . despite the intensive investigations of the last years , the main open problem remains a sound theoretical interpretation of the large experimental values of the ratio @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large uncertainties involved in the experimental determination of the ratio do not allow to reach any definitive conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 puzzle is strongly related to the so  </S>",
    "<S> called @xmath5 rule on the isospin change in the non  mesonic decay , whose possible violation can not be established at present , again due to the insufficient precision of the data . </S>",
    "<S> although recent works offer a step forward in the solution of the puzzle , further efforts ( especially on the experimental side ) must be invested in order to understand the detailed dynamics of the non  mesonic decay . even if , by means of _ single _ nucleon spectra measurements , the error bars on @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> have been considerably reduced very recently at kek ( however , with central data compatible with older experiments ) , a clean extraction of @xmath4 is needed . </S>",
    "<S> what is missing at present , but planned for the next future , are measurements of 1 ) nucleon energy spectra in _ </S>",
    "<S> double _ coincidence and 2 ) nucleon angular correlations : such observations allow to disentangle the nucleons produced in one and two  body induced decays and lead to a _ direct _ determination of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the two  body component of the non  mesonic decay rates has not been measured yet , due to the too low counting rates expected for a coincidence experiment . </S>",
    "<S> for the asymmetric non  mesonic decay of polarized hypernuclei the situation is even more puzzling . indeed , strong inconsistencies appear already among data . </S>",
    "<S> a recent experiment obtained a positive intrinsic @xmath0 asymmetry parameter , @xmath6 , for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in complete disagreement with a previous measurement , which obtained a large and negative @xmath6 for @xmath8shell hypernuclei , and with theory , which predicts a negative value moderately dependent on nuclear structure effects . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case , improved experiments establishing with certainty the sign and magnitude of @xmath6 for @xmath9 and @xmath8shell hypernuclei will provide a guidance for a deeper understanding of hypernuclear dynamics and decay mechanisms .    </S>",
