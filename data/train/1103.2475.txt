    "the inflationary paradigm provides a natural mechanism of generating the seeds of inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) which then evolve to the observed , large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the general scenario involves a rather small set of assumptions : i ) sometime in its early history , the universe underwent a phase of rapid expansion during which the hubble parameter was nearly constant ; ii ) during this phase , the universe was well described by a friedmann , lematre , robertson , walker ( flrw ) solution to einstein s equations together with small inhomogeneities which are well approximated by first order perturbations ; iii ) consider the co - moving fourier mode @xmath2 of perturbations which has just re - entered the hubble radius now .",
    "a few e - foldings before the time @xmath3 at which @xmath2 exited the hubble radius during inflation , fourier modes of quantum fields describing perturbations were in the bunch - davis vacuum for co - moving wave numbers in the range @xmath4 ; and , iv ) soon after a mode exited the hubble radius , its quantum fluctuation can be regarded as a classical perturbation and evolved via linearized einstein s equations .",
    "analysis of these perturbations implies that there must be tiny inhomogeneities at the last scattering surface whose detailed features have now been seen in the cmb .",
    "furthermore , time evolution of these tiny inhomogeneities produces large scale structures which are in excellent qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "therefore , even though the assumptions have ad - hoc elements , they appear to capture a germ of truth , not unlike the bohr atom did a hundred years ago .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us assume a quadratic potential for the inflaton and supplement our calculations with values of two parameters provided by the seven year wmap data @xcite : the amplitude @xmath5 of the scalar power spectrum @xmath6 and the scalar spectral index @xmath7 at the time the fiducial mode @xmath8 used by wmap exits the hubble radius ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "these numbers , together with the friedmann equation , determine the values of slow roll parameters and _ the initial data for the inflaton and the gravitational field _ at time @xmath10 to within posted observational errors .",
    "a slow roll follows and dynamics of perturbations during this epoch directly lead to the spectrum of inhomogeneities seen in the cmb",
    ". we will refer to this inflationary phase as the _ desired _ slow roll to distinguish it from other inflationary phases that may have occurred , e.g. , in an even earlier phase .",
    "the striking success of the scenario brings to forefront an old issue in a sharper form : does the desired slow roll inflation occur generically in a given theoretical paradigm ? that is ,",
    "do generic dynamical trajectories pass through the neighborhood of the values of the inflaton and gravitational fields selected by the wmap data with its error bars ?",
    "this would require that the inflaton must have been significantly high up compared to the minimum of the potential at the onset of the desired slow roll .",
    "how did it get there ?",
    "is it essential to invoke some rare quantum fluctuations to account for the required initial conditions because the a priori probability for their occurrence is low ? or ,",
    "is the desired slow roll inflation robust in the sense that it is realized in ` almost all ' dynamical trajectories of the given theory ?    to make these questions precise one needs a well - defined framework to calculate probabilities of various occurrences _ within any given theory_. a mathematically natural strategy to achieve this goal was introduced over two decades ago ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recall first that the space @xmath11 of solutions to physically interesting classical systems generally carries the natural liouville measure @xmath12 .",
    "the idea was to calculate _ a priori _ probabilities using a flat probability distribution @xmath13 in conjunction with @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely , the a priori probability of an event @xmath14 is given by the _",
    "liouville volume of @xmath11 occupied by the region @xmath15 consisting of solutions on which the event @xmath14 is realized @xcite . in our case , then , the a priori probability is given by the fractional volume occupied by the sub - space of solutions in which the desired slow roll inflation occurs .",
    "note that this a priori probability provides only a ` bare ' estimate and further physical input can and should be used to provide sharper probability distributions @xmath16 and a more reliable likelihood . however",
    ", a priori probabilities themselves can be directly useful if they are very low or very high . in these cases",
    ", it would be an especially heavy burden on the fundamental theory to come up with the physical input that significantly alters them .",
    "however , there is a conceptual obstacle in this calculation : the total liouville measure of the space @xmath11 of solutions is infinite @xcite , hence there is an intrinsic ambiguity in the calculation of relative probabilities @xcite .",
    "but in the observationally favored k=0 flrw model , this divergence is a gauge artifact . more precisely , a gauge group @xmath17 acts on @xmath11 and , although the quotient @xmath18 the space of physically distinct solutions is compact ( with boundary ) , the gauge orbits are non - compact , making the total volume of @xmath11 infinite .",
    "it would first appear that the obvious way to avoid the infinite volume is to work directly with the space @xmath18 of physically distinct solutions .",
    "however , as we will see , the liouville measure does not naturally project down to @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , to calculate probabilities , _ one has to introduce an additional structure .",
    "_ because the subtleties associated with the interplay between the action of the gauge group and the liouville measure were not well - understood , the necessity and importance of this additional step was , apparently , not appreciated .",
    "we will see in section [ s3.2 ] that _ there is an intrinsic ambiguity in carrying out this step within general relativity . _ as a recent analysis of corichi and karami @xcite shows , this ambiguity is directly related to the diverging conclusions on probability of inflation in general relativity drawn by koffmann , linde and mukhanov @xcite and gibbons and turok @xcite .",
    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) provides a new arena to analyze this issue because the big bang singularity is naturally resolved and replaced by a big bounce due to quantum geometry effects @xcite .",
    "we will see in section [ s3 ] that , thanks to the presence of a canonical bounce time , one can now naturally resolve the ambiguity in the construction of the measure on @xmath11 with finite total volume . _ were we to try to mimic this construction in general relativity , we would be led to work at the singularity in place of the bounce , where the calculation would be meaningless .",
    "_ away from the planck regime , lqc is virtually indistinguishable from general relativity .",
    "however , in the planck regime , there are huge differences and these are crucial in overcoming the obstacle . with this measure at hand",
    ", we can calculate the a priori probability of the slow roll of the desired type .",
    "lqc dynamics are such that this probability turns out to be greater than 0.999997 : dynamical trajectories starting from almost all initial data at the bounce surface pass through the phase space region selected by the wmap data .",
    "therefore , extreme fine tuning would be necessary to zero - in on solutions where the desired slow roll does _ not _ occur .",
    "some of the results of our investigation were reported in a letter @xcite .",
    "therefore there is an inevitable overlap with @xcite but there are also key differences .",
    "first , in @xcite we analyzed the likelihood of the occurrence of a slow roll inflation with at least @xmath19 e - foldings in the history of the universe to the future of the bounce . in this paper",
    "we analyze a much _ sharper question : _ what is the probability of occurrence of a slow roll with initial conditions that are compatible with the 7 year wmap data ?",
    "thus we now focus _ only _ on that slow roll phase which is directly relevant to structure formation .",
    "second , numerical simulations reported in @xcite used values of cosmological parameters the mass of the inflaton and the values of the slow roll parameters from linde s 2006 review @xcite while in this paper we use instead the more recent results of the 7 year wmap data @xcite .",
    "this accounts for some differences in some of the detailed numerical results .",
    "finally , and more importantly , our goal now is broader than that of @xcite in the following sense . in lqc",
    ", the big bounce is followed by a qualitatively new phase of super - inflation which could have observable consequences .",
    "therefore , it is important to have a sufficiently detailed account of the new dynamics from the big bounce to the onset of the desired slow roll .",
    "a second goal of this paper is to provide this analysis .",
    "this detailed description is likely to serve as the point of departure of further work bridging the planck era of lqc to the inflationary paradigm described in the beginning of this section .",
    "this bridge may , for example , provide a better understanding of why the quantum state of relevant modes is well approximated by the bunch davis vacuum at the onset of inflation , and may even furnish the quantum gravity corrections to this state @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we first recall the relevant features of lqc and then introduce the phase space and basic equations . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we first introduce the liouville measure on the space @xmath11 of solutions , discuss the issue of gauge and obtain the measure on the space @xmath18 of physically distinct solutions in lqc . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we discuss in detail the lqc dynamics from the big bounce to the end of inflation using a combination of analytical and numerical methods . using this information and the measure introduced in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we calculate the a priori probability of obtaining the desired slow roll . as noted already , in lqc",
    "this probability is very close to 1 .",
    "section [ s5 ] summarizes the main results and compares and contrasts them with related results in the literature .",
    "the material is organized so that cosmologists who may be more interested in inflationary dynamics of lqc than in the issue of measures can skip sections [ s2.2 ] and especially [ s3 ] without loss of continuity .",
    "this section is divided into two parts : in the first , we recall the distinguishing features of lqc that are important to our analysis . in the second",
    ", we present effective lqc equations governing dynamics of the flrw model coupled to a scalar field with any potential ( satisfying mild regularity conditions ) and introduce the liouville measure on the space of solutions .      in lqc",
    ", one applies the basic principles of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite to simple cosmological models .",
    "thanks to the quantum geometry underlying lqg , lqc differs from the older wheeler - dewitt theory already at the kinematical level .",
    "it turns out that the wheeler - dewitt equation is no longer well - defined on the new kinematical hilbert space . instead , now the quantum hamiltonian constraint has to be obtained via a procedure that pays due attention to the quantum geometry of lqg , in particular , the area gap @xmath20 .",
    "( here @xmath21 is the barbero - immirzi parameter of lqg , whose value @xmath22 is fixed by black hole entropy calculations @xcite . ) somewhat surprisingly , the resulting dynamics naturally resolves the big bang and big crunch singularities of general relativity @xcite .",
    "exotic matter is not needed ; indeed matter fields can satisfy all the standard energy conditions .",
    "detailed analysis has been carried out in a variety of models : the k=0 , 1 flrw space - times with or without a cosmological constant @xcite ; bianchi models @xcite which admit anisotropies as well as gravitational waves ; and gowdy models @xcite which admit inhomogeneities , and therefore an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the flrw models have been studied most extensively , using both analytical and numerical methods to solve the exact quantum equations of lqc @xcite . in these models , the big bang and the big - crunch",
    "are replaced by a quantum bounce , which is followed by a robust phase of super - inflation .",
    "interestingly , full quantum dynamics , including the bounce , is well - approximated by certain effective equations @xcite .",
    "these equations imply that all strong curvature singularities including the big rip and sudden - death are resolved in flrw models with matter satisfying an equation of state of the type @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "( for recent reviews , see @xcite . )    in this paper we will restrict our matter source to be a scalar field with the standard ( positive ) kinetic energy and a suitable potential . since all the prior discussion of probabilities is based on general relativity , to facilitate comparison we use effective equations rather than the full quantum theory .",
    "finally , we will use the natural planck units c=@xmath24=g=1 ( rather than @xmath25g=1 , often employed in cosmology ) .",
    "planck length will be denoted by @xmath26 and planck mass by @xmath27 .",
    "the fundamental time unit , @xmath28 , will be referred to as _ a planck second_.    in lqc , it is convenient to encode spatial geometry in a variable @xmath29 proportional to the physical volume of a fixed , fiducial , cubical cell , rather than the scale factor @xmath30 .",
    "the conjugate momentum is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "these are related to the scale factor and its conjugate momentum via is taken to be the oriented volume which is positive for positively oriented triads and negative for negatively oriented ones .",
    "however , since the change of orientation is a large gauge transformation , in the classical and effective theories on can restrict oneself just to positive @xmath29 .",
    "we have done so for simplicity of discussion . ]",
    "[ vb ] = b=- where @xmath32 is the co - moving volume of the fiducial cell , so that its physical volume is @xmath33 .",
    "( thus , the only non - vanishing poisson bracket is @xmath34 . ) on solutions to _",
    "einstein s equations _ , @xmath31 is related to the standard hubble parameter @xmath35 via @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "however , lqc modifies einstein dynamics and on solutions to the lqc effective equations we have [ h ] h = 2b ( 0.93 ) 2b where @xmath37 is the ` area - gap ' that sets the discreteness scale of lqc .",
    "@xmath31 ranges over @xmath38 in lqc and general relativity is recovered in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "quantum geometry effects modify the geometric , left side of einstein s equations .",
    "in particular , the friedmann equation becomes [ lqc - fe2 ] = ( + v ( ) ) .to compare with the standard friedmann equation @xmath40 , it is often convenient to use ( [ h ] ) to write ( [ lqc - fe2 ] ) as [ lqc - fe ] ( ) ^2 h^2 = ( 1 - ) where @xmath41 . by inspection",
    "it is clear from eqs ( [ h ] ) - ( [ lqc - fe ] ) that , away from the planck regime i.e .",
    ", when @xmath42 , or , @xmath43 we recover classical general relativity .",
    "however , modifications in the planck regime are drastic .",
    "the main features of this new physics can be summarized as follows .    in general relativity",
    ", the friedmann equation implies that if the matter density is positive , @xmath44 can not vanish .",
    "therefore every solution represents _ either _ a contracting universe _ or _ an expanding one .",
    "by contrast , the lqc modified friedmann equation ( [ lqc - fe ] ) implies that @xmath45 vanishes at @xmath46 .",
    "this is the quantum bounce . to its past , the solution represents a contracting universe with @xmath47 and to its future , an expanding one with @xmath48 .    as is customary in the literature on probabilities ,",
    "let us ignore the exceptional de sitter solutions . on all other solutions",
    "@xmath31 is monotonically non - increasing , evolving from from @xmath49 in the infinite past to @xmath50 in the infinite future .",
    "eqs ( [ lqc - fe2 ] ) and ( [ lqc - fe ] ) imply that @xmath51 at the bounce .",
    "thus , each solution undergoes precisely one bounce .",
    "in contrast to general relativity , the hubble parameter @xmath52 is no longer monotonic in lqc . it _ vanishes _ at the bounce while in general relativity it diverges at the singularity and is large in the entire planck regime . in lqc , @xmath53 is bounded above , @xmath54 , and achieves its upper bound in every solution at the end of super - inflation .",
    "if the potential @xmath55 is bounded below , say @xmath56 , then it follows from ( [ lqc - fe2 ] ) that @xmath57 is bounded by @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath59 grows unboundedly for large @xmath60 , then @xmath60 is also bounded .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 .",
    "when the potential is bounded below , @xmath63 is bounded above by @xmath64 .",
    "the ricci scalar the only non - trivial curvature scalar in these models is bounded above by @xmath65 . thus",
    ", physical quantities which diverge at the big bang of general relativity can not exceed certain finite , maximum values in lqc .",
    "one can also show that if @xmath66 initially , it can not vanish in finite proper time along any solution .",
    "thus , _ the lqc solutions are everywhere regular irrespective of whether one focuses on matter density , curvature or the scale factor . _ +      the full set of space - time equations of motion can be written in terms of @xmath67 .",
    "these variables are subject to the constraint ( [ lqc - fe ] ) and evolve via : [ dyn ] & & = + & & + + v _ , = 0 . to calculate probabilities , in section [ s3 ] we have to equip the space @xmath11 of solutions to these equations with a natural measure .",
    "as a first step in that procedure , we will now obtain a phase space formulation of these equations .",
    "the phase space and equations of general relativity can be recovered by taking the limit @xmath68 ( which in particular implies @xmath69 ) .",
    "the phase space @xmath70 consists of quadruplets @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is given by ; @xmath73 .",
    "the variables @xmath74 range over the entire real line , @xmath29 over the positive half of the real line , while @xmath75 $ ] ( since we focus only on the post - bounce branches of solutions ) .",
    "thus , the symplectic 2-form is given by [ omega ] = + b vhence the liouville measure on @xmath70 is simply @xmath76 .",
    "the lqc friedmann equation implies that these variables must lie on a constraint surface @xmath77 defined by [ hc ] c - ^2b + + 2v v ( ) 0 .",
    "they evolve via [ evo ] & = & , = - , + & = & , _ ( ) = -2v v _ , .",
    "as is well - known , the space of solutions @xmath11 is naturally isomorphic to a gauge - fixed surface , i.e. , a 2-dimensional surface @xmath78 of @xmath77 which is intersected by each dynamical trajectory once and only once .",
    "since @xmath31 is monotonic in each solution , an obvious strategy is to choose for @xmath78 a 2-dimensional surface @xmath79 ( a fixed constant ) within @xmath77 .",
    "it is straightforward to pull - back the symplectic structure to this 2-dimensional gauge - fixed surface @xmath78 .",
    "using the constraint ( [ hc ] ) , it is convenient to coordinatize @xmath78 using @xmath80 and express the pulled - back symplectic structure in terms of them : [ omegahat ] = ^ vthis 2-form provides provides a liouville measure @xmath81 on @xmath78 and hence of the space @xmath11 of solutions to the effective equations , given simply by [ muhat ] _  = ^ v .",
    "the most natural choice in lqc is to set @xmath82 so that @xmath77 is just the ` bounce surface ' .",
    "we will make this choice because it also turns out to be convenient for calculations .",
    "however , since the dynamical flow preserves the symplectic structure on @xmath70 , this measure on @xmath11 is insensitive to the choice of @xmath83 used in gauge fixing .",
    "recall from section [ s1 ] that the a priori probability of occurrence of any event @xmath14 is to be given by the fractional volume of the region @xmath15 in @xmath11 spanned by solutions in which e occurs : [ prob ] p(e)= . since the liouville measure is purely kinematical , this method of calculating a priori probabilities realizes laplace s _ principle of indifference _ @xcite .",
    "this interpretation can be made explicit as follows .",
    "physical input can provide a ( non - negative ) probability density function @xmath84 on @xmath11 satisfying the normalization condition [ @xmath85/ [ \\int_{\\s}\\dd\\hat{\\mu}_{\\rm l } ] = 1 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding ( more refined ) probability of occurrence of @xmath14 is then given by p_(e ) = .",
    "now , one can quantify the information contained in @xmath84 via i_= . since @xmath86 is minimized by @xmath87 , ( [ prob ] )",
    "is the _ a priori _ probability , free of any input or bias . as mentioned in section [ s1 ] , these ` bare ' probabilities are useful when they are extremely low or extremely high . in these cases",
    "it is a heavy burden on any theory to provide sufficient information to significantly overcome this bare probability .",
    "in section [ s3.1 ] we illustrate these ideas using a 2-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator constrained to have a fixed energy . in this case",
    "the solution space @xmath11 is compact .",
    "since the total liouville volume of @xmath11 is finite , one can directly implement the ideas outlined above to calculate various probabilities . in section [ s3.2 ]",
    "we turn to lqc . in this case , @xmath11 is non - compact .",
    "but we will see that this non - compactness can be directly attributed to the action of a gauge group @xmath17 on @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , it is now natural to work with the space @xmath88 of physically distinct solutions which is compact .",
    "however , there is a subtlety which makes the calculation of desired probabilities ambiguous in general relativity .",
    "we discuss this problem and show that it has a natural resolution in lqc .",
    "cosmologists who are more interested in the lqc dynamics than in the issue of measure on @xmath11 can skip section [ s3 ] without loss of continuity .",
    "since we encounter a constrained hamiltonian system both in general relativity and ( effective ) lqc , let us begin with a simple example with this feature to illustrate the procedure of calculating probabilities .",
    "consider a 2-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator constrained to have a fixed energy @xmath14 .",
    "let us fix the mass and spring constant to unity for simplicity .",
    "the topology of our phase - space @xmath70 is then @xmath89 , in which we can choose canonical coordinates @xmath90 , with symplectic structure : = x_1 p_1 + x_2 p_2 the hamiltonian constraint is : h : = ( x_1 ^ 2+p_1 ^ 2+x_2 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2 ) = e the constrained surface @xmath77 is the 3-sphere with radius @xmath91 in @xmath89 and thus compact .",
    "the hamiltonian vector field is given by x_h = x_1 - p_1 + x_2 - p_2 the vector field is of course tangential to @xmath77 and its orbits provide a hopf fibration : each orbit is an @xmath92 fiber with the base space being @xmath93 .",
    "this base space represents the space @xmath11 of solutions of the constrained system under consideration .",
    "it is convenient to use a set of coordinates adapted to this hopf fibration : x_1+ip_1 = e^i_1 z_1 x_2+ip_2 = e^i_2 z_2 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "then @xmath77 is given by @xmath96 and the angles @xmath97 provide a a natural set of intrinsic coordinates on it .",
    "the pull - back @xmath98 of @xmath99 to @xmath77 can now be expressed as     as discussed in section [ s4.1 ] , for the quadratic potential the wmap data implies that there was a time @xmath100 in the early history of the universe when @xmath101 and @xmath102 within error bars ( of @xmath103 ) . in lqc we can specify the initial data at the bounce .",
    "numerical simulations let us answer the following question for the extreme kinetic energy dominated bounce : what are restrictions on the initial data at the bounce for the ensuing lqc dynamical trajectory to meet the wmap constraint ?",
    "full numerical simulations bear out conclusions suggested by tables i and v : [ suff ]    f 1.25 10 ^ -6 & +     thus , in the extreme kinetic dominated case , _ we are guaranteed that the event @xmath14 the desired slow roll compatible with wmap observations will be realized in the solution under consideration if @xmath104 is outside the interval @xmath105 . _",
    "( again , this is only a sufficient condition . ) since full range of @xmath104 in the kinetic energy dominated case under consideration is @xmath106 , this result suggests that @xmath14 will be realized in ` more than half the trajectories ' in this case .",
    "we will sharpen this statement using the normalized liouville measure in section [ s4.4 ] .",
    "the precise numbers in the sufficient condition ( [ suff ] ) depend on the sign of @xmath107 at the bounce",
    ". we will conclude with a brief discussion of the origin of the difference between the @xmath108 and @xmath109 cases .",
    "the origin of the asymmetry lies in the fact that ( because of symmetries of field equations ) we have restricted ourselves to data with @xmath110 .",
    "so , if @xmath111 , the inflaton is already rolling down the potential at the bounce .",
    "if initially it is sufficiently high up in the potential with , @xmath112 , friction can slow it down sufficiently for the desired slow roll to begin at @xmath113 .",
    "but if @xmath114 , then the kinetic energy is too large for the friction term to slow it sufficiently for the desired slow roll to commence before it reaches the bottom of the potential .",
    "then it starts climbing up on the @xmath115 branch but does not acquire a value higher that @xmath116 required for the dynamical trajectory to pass through the region satisfying the wmap constraints . in the @xmath108 case , by contrast , if @xmath117 , the kinetic energy at the bounce is sufficient to propel the inflaton to values higher than @xmath118 on the @xmath119 branch of the potential to allow for the desired slow roll .    in subsection [ s4.3.2 ] , we will show that the likelihood of attaining the desired slow roll is in fact @xmath1 if the bounce is _ not _ extreme kinetic energy dominated and in section [ s4.4 ] we will calculate the precise probability for the occurrence of @xmath14 on the entire space @xmath11 of solutions using the normalized liouville measure .",
    "in section [ s4.3.1 ] we continue our description of qualitative features of lqc dynamics , now for bounces with @xmath120 .",
    "this discussion is rather sketchy compared to that of section [ s4.2 ] because in this case there are no subtleties with respect to the wmap data : as we show in section [ s4.3.2 ] , all dynamical trajectories meeting this condition at the bounce satisfy the wmap constraints .",
    "we will highlight only those features which are qualitatively different from the kinetic energy dominated bounce discussed in detail in section [ s4.2 ] . again , for concreteness , we will focus on the case when @xmath121 and @xmath122 are both positive .",
    "let us begin with the intermediate case @xmath123 where the kinetic energy still exceeds the potential energy at the bounce but does not dominate it as in section [ s4.2 ] .",
    "the super - inflation era is similar to that described in section [ s4.2.1 ] but because @xmath122 is now lower , the phase lasts longer .",
    "the inflaton climbs up the potential but change in its value is again small .",
    "the hubble parameter , on contrast , is again dynamical .",
    "however , the post super - inflation dynamics exhibits significant differences . for ,",
    "now the value of @xmath121 is higher and @xmath122 lower while , as before , @xmath53 assumes its largest value at the end of super - inflation .",
    "therefore , the coefficient of friction , @xmath124 , is again large but there is less kinetic energy to lose before reaching the turn - around . , which is now reached within @xmath125 after the bounce .",
    "consequently , now the change @xmath126 is negligible , a key feature not shared by regime ( i ) .",
    "next , let us examine the @xmath127 where the potential energy is greater than the kinetic energy .",
    "now , the lqc effects dominate for an even longer time .",
    "again , because @xmath128 , the inflaton climbs up the potential but turns around earlier and earlier and the super - inflation phase lasts longer and longer as @xmath104 increases .",
    "now the turn around ( @xmath129 ) will occur _ during super - inflation ! _",
    "the change @xmath130 is even more negligible because the kinetic energy at the bounce is lower than that in the @xmath131 case .",
    "the slow roll conditions are easily met soon after turn - around .",
    "a difference from this phase of slow roll and that for @xmath132 is that @xmath53 continues to grow during the slow roll because we are still in the super - inflation phase .",
    "there is an enormous number of slow roll e - foldings already in the deep planck regime where the matter density is greater than half the critical density .      in the extreme kinetic energy domination",
    "we could carry out numerical simulations starting from the bounce until the end of the desired slow roll . for @xmath133 ,",
    "this becomes quite difficult even with the truncation error as small as one part in @xmath134 because the super - inflation phase can become so long that the required evolution spans @xmath135 or more .",
    "therefore , to maintain the precision we had in the kinetic dominated case , another line of reasoning is necessary .",
    "at which the reference mode @xmath136 exits the hubble horizon , @xmath137 and @xmath138 within error bars of @xmath139 .",

    "this ensures that there are no ` gaps ' , i.e. , we will cover the full space of initial data at the bounce . ]",
    "we will first argue that the resulting dynamical trajectory _ must pass _ through the point with @xmath148 with _ some _ kinetic energy .",
    "since this is a low value of @xmath60 , the inflation will reach the wmap value @xmath149 rather quickly .",
    "so it is feasible to carry out a numerical simulation for dynamics between @xmath148 and @xmath150 with the desired , high degree of accuracy .",
    "the question for numerics is then : is the value of @xmath151 at the time when @xmath152 close to the wmap value @xmath101 within the 4.5% error bars ?",
    "for initial data at the bounce for which @xmath153 , the super - inflation phase will last very long time and , had we begun the simulation at the bounce , we would have lost accuracy by the time the inflaton reaches @xmath154 .",
    "we avoid this problem by giving an _ analytic argument _ that the inflation _ must _ reach @xmath155 and carry out numerical calculations for dynamics only between @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "let us begin with the negative branch of the @xmath121 space , i.e. , first consider the case when @xmath158 . in this case , immediately after the bounce the inflaton will roll down the potential .",
    "intuitively , it may seem obvious that in this descent it must encounter the point @xmath159 with _ some _ kinetic energy .",
    "but a priori there are two possibilities that may prevent this occurrence .",
    "first , we have to examine the possibility that the inflaton may come to rest for some value @xmath160 and just stops there .",
    "but the equation ( [ inflaton ] ) satisfied by the inflaton implies that at the instant @xmath161 , @xmath162 ( since @xmath163 ) .",
    "therefore the inflaton can not just stay at @xmath164 .",
    "a more subtle possibility is that the inflaton asymptotically approaches @xmath165 , with @xmath142 approaching zero , but never actually reaches it in a finite time .",
    "that is , the limiting value of @xmath142 could be zero at @xmath166 but this could happen at time @xmath167 . but",
    "by integrating ( [ inflaton ] ) between the bounce time @xmath168 and the hypothetical time @xmath169 at which @xmath142 is to vanish , it is easy to show that : t_o - t _",
    "< so that @xmath169 is necessarily finite . thus , if @xmath170 ( and by assumption @xmath171 ) , the inflaton _ must _ slide down the potential and reach the value @xmath172 with _ some _ kinetic energy .    next , consider the case when @xmath119 .",
    "in this case , our focus will be on initial data at the bounce with @xmath173 .",
    "since we again have @xmath174 , initially the inflaton now _ climbs up _ the potential .",
    "however , it again follows from ( [ inflaton ] ) that it reaches @xmath175 in a finite time @xmath169 and at that time @xmath176 ( since @xmath140 is now positive ) .",
    "so this is the turn around point and the inflaton rolls down the potential .",
    "again , by the same reasoning as before , as it rolls down , the inflaton can not come to rest for a value @xmath177 .",
    "therefore as it rolls down , it must pass through the point @xmath178 , for _ some _ value of @xmath142 . to summarize , dynamical trajectories for _ every initial data at the bounce with _",
    "@xmath179 _ eventually encounter a point at which _",
    "@xmath180 .",
    "we used high precision numerics to analyze the lqc dynamics following this event .",
    "the value of @xmath142 at this event can be arbitrary .",
    "we sampled the full range , @xmath181 , first using uniformly distributed _ thousand _ data points and then logarithmically distributed _ thousand _ points . using @xmath182 and each of these values of @xmath142 as initial data solved the full set of lqc equations numerically .",
    "the key questions then are : i ) do all these dynamical trajectories eventually pass through a phase space point at which @xmath183 ; and , ii ) within the wmap error bars , which of them have @xmath184 at the time when @xmath140 assumes the value @xmath185 ? as one would expect from the analytical considerations discussed above , the answer to the first question is in the affirmative .",
    "as the inflaton rolls down the potential from @xmath159 , it necessarily encounters the value @xmath186 .",
    "the answer to the second question is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : _ in each of these two sets of 1000 simulations _ , at the time the inflaton assumes the value @xmath187 , the slow roll parameter @xmath151 takes values in the range = 810 ^ -3 2 10 ^ -5 .",
    "that is , each of these trajectories passes through the small portion of the phase space compatible with the wmap data .",
    "finally , let us consider the complementary case with initial data at the bounce satisfying @xmath188 . in this case ,",
    "as discussed above , the inflaton first rises up the potential and then rolls down .",
    "therefore now the numerical simulation should start with @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "but because of the symmetry on the space of solutions noted in the beginning of section [ s4.2 ] , these solutions can be obtained just by reversing the sign of the solutions @xmath191 obtained from numerical evolutions starting from the initial data @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "thus , all the dynamical trajectories are compatible with the wmap data also in this case .    to summarize , combining the results of sections [ s4.2.3 ] and numerical simulations just discussed",
    ", we can conclude that the lqc dynamical trajectories resulting from _ any _ initial data at the bounce surface with @xmath179 realizes the constraints on values of fields at @xmath194 imposed by the wmap data .",
    "thus , it is only when the bounce is in the extreme kinetic dominated regime that some of the dynamical trajectory namely those that violate ( [ suff ] ) can fail to meet the wmap constraint .",
    "we are now ready to combine results of sections [ s3.2 ] , [ s4.2 ] and [ s4.3 ] to calculate the a priori probability of realizing the desired slow roll in lqc .    in the terminology of section [ s3.2 ] ,",
    "the event @xmath14 of interest is the passage of the dynamical trajectory through the small region in the phase space singled out by the wmap data and our task is to find the _ relative _ volume of the region @xmath15 of the space of solutions in which @xmath14 occurs .",
    "the calculation requires a normalized measure . in section [ s3.2 ]",
    "we found that , thanks to a suitable gauge fixing , each equivalence class of physically distinct lqc solutions can be characterized completely by the value @xmath121 of the inflaton at the bounce surface . since @xmath195 at the bounce , ( [ vol ] ) implies that the total measure on the space @xmath196 of physically distinct solutions is given by n = _  _ o = _ -_max^_max ( - 4 ^2 ^ 2 m^2 ^2)^ = where we have used the fact that we have a quadratic potential and where , for definiteness we have set the volume @xmath197 at the bounce to @xmath1 .",
    "( recall that @xmath197 simply rescales the measure by a constant and therefore drops out in the calculation of probabilities . ) the probability @xmath198 of the occurrence of our event @xmath14 is then given by ( [ prob ] ) : p(e ) = _ ( e ) ( - 4 ^2 ^ 2 m^2 ^2)^ where @xmath199 is the interval on the @xmath121-axis corresponding to the physically distinct lqc solutions in which @xmath14 occurs .",
    "( for details , see section [ s3.2 ] . )    in sections [ s4.2 ] and [ s4.3 ] we found that a _ sufficient _",
    "condition for the event @xmath14 to occur is that the initial data of the solution at the bounce should satisfy _ [ -5.5 , .94]f [ -7.3510 ^ -6 , 1.2510 ^ -6 ] therefore the probability that @xmath14 does _ not _ occur is bounded by the length of the interval @xmath200 $ ] in the @xmath121-axis w.r.t . the measure given by the 1-form @xmath201 : p ( ) & & ( _ 0^_+ + _ 0^ _ - ) ( - 4 ^2 ^ 2 m^2 ^2)^ + & & ( f_+ + ^-1",
    "f_+ ) + ( f_- + ^-1 f_- ) + & & 2.74 10 ^ -6where @xmath202 and @xmath203 . thus , the probability that the desired slow roll does _ not _ occur in an lqc solution is _ less than three parts in a million_. hence a great deal of fine tuning would be necessary to avoid the slow roll inflation that meets the wmap constraints .    for simplicity ,",
    "throughout our analysis , we set the cosmological constant @xmath204 to be zero .",
    "but it is completely straightforward to include it since it just shifts the zero of our potential .",
    "since the sign of the observed cosmological constant is positive , for any given value of @xmath140 , its inclusion would have the effect of increasing the fraction of the total energy density in the potential .",
    "this in turn would _ lower _ the values of @xmath205 that are needed in ( [ suff ] ) to ensure that the trajectory meets the wmap constraint .",
    "thus the probability of achieving the desired slow roll would further increase .",
    "however , since the observed value of @xmath204 is so small , this effect will not be noticeable even at the level of numerical accuracy used in this paper .",
    "we also focused on the spatially flat flrw models because they are observationally favored .",
    "but it is not difficult to include spatial curvature .",
    "again , given observational constraints , we expect that this inclusion will not significantly alter our main conclusions @xcite . in these respects ,",
    "the results are robust .    what about the choice of the inflaton potential ?",
    "all our detailed considerations hold only for a quadratic potential .",
    "recall however that a generic potential @xmath55 is well - approximated by a quadratic one near its minimum .",
    "suppose @xmath55 has a single minimum @xmath206 and that @xmath207 for all @xmath208 $ ] where @xmath209 .",
    "then our considerations will apply : as the inflaton slides down from @xmath210 it will enter a phase of slow roll inflation compatible with the wmap constraints . as an illustration ,",
    "let us suppose that the potential is a combination of a quadratic and a quartic parts : v ( ) = m^2 ^ 2 + ^4 then , our assumption is met if @xmath211 . for a rough comparison , note that the wmap bound for a pure quartic potential is @xmath212 .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable to expect that , at a qualitative level , our conclusions on probabilities will continue to hold for a wide class of physically interesting potentials .",
    "in the main body of this paper we analyzed inflation in the observationally most interesting case of the k=0 flrw cosmologies using the framework of lqc . our goal was two - fold .",
    "first , assuming a quadratic potential , we examined in detail the effective lqc dynamics in presence of an inflaton with standard potentials .",
    "second , we used this dynamics to calculate the _ a priori _ probability of realizing the desired slow roll inflation that is compatible with the wmap data .",
    "let us begin with dynamics . since the big bang singularity is replaced by the big bounce , and since all physical fields are regular at the bounce , we could specify initial conditions at the bounce surface and explore the resulting dynamics .",
    "we allowed _ all possible _ initial data , subject only to the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we found that the subsequent dynamics is sensitive to the distribution of energy density at the bounce between kinetic and potential parts . in all cases , there is a universal super - inflation phase that follows the bounce ; indeed it persists even when there is no potential at all . for concreteness ,",
    "let us focus on the case when @xmath142 and @xmath140 are both positive at the bounce so the inflaton is climbing up the potential .",
    "we first discussed in detail the case in which less than one part in @xmath213 of the total energy density at the bounce is in the potential because this is the only case in which some of the solutions can fail to exhibit the desired slow roll . in this case , the super - inflation phase is very short lived .",
    "however , it is also extremely dynamic : during the fraction of a planck second of super - inflation , the hubble parameter increases dramatically from zero to its _ maximum allowed value _ , @xmath214 .",
    "because @xmath53 is so large at the end of super - inflation , the friction term in the equation of motion of the inflaton is also large whence the inflaton loses kinetic energy as it climbs up the potential .",
    "after @xmath215 , the potential energy equals kinetic energy and then dominates it ( where , as before , @xmath216 denotes planck seconds ) .",
    "after another @xmath217 , @xmath142 vanishes , the inflaton turns around and starts climbing down the potential . in a ` majority ' of solutions but",
    "not all it soon enters the desired slow roll that is compatible with the 7-year wmap observations @xcite .    in the intermediate case ,",
    "the kinetic energy is still greater than the potential at the bounce but does not overwhelm it . now dynamics undergo the same qualitative phases .",
    "however , the super - inflation phase lasts a bit longer and the turn around occurs much sooner , only about @xmath125 after the bounce .",
    "this is because the initial kinetic energy is smaller than that in the first case while the strength of the friction term is the same because the hubble parameter again takes its maximum value at the end of super - inflation . because the turn around occurs much sooner , in contrast to the situation in the extreme kinetic domination ,",
    "the increase in the value of @xmath140 between the bounce and the turn - around is very small . finally , if the potential energy density exceeds the kinetic energy density at the bounce , dynamics is very different .",
    "now the lqc effects dominate in the sense that the super - inflation phase lasts longer and its duration increases rapidly as the fraction of total energy in the potential increases .",
    "furthermore , the turn around occurs already during super - inflation !",
    "our first goal was to present these qualitative differences in the pre - slow - roll dynamics .",
    "the wmap data puts very strong constraints on the values of fields at the time @xmath10 when the mode with wave number @xmath8 exits the hubble radius during the desired phase of inflation .",
    "the key question is : are ` most ' dynamical trajectories such that these constraints are met at _ some _ time during the post - bounce evolution ?",
    "we showed that the answer is in the affirmative unless the bounce is kinetic energy dominated as in section [ s4.2 ] . even in this case , the wmap constraints are met unless fraction of the total energy at the bounce which is in the potential is less than @xmath218 . in this precise sense the tiny region of phase space selected by the wmap data serves as an _ attractor _ to lqc dynamics .",
    "this may not seem surprising because inflationary trajectories are known to be attractors also in general relativity .",
    "however , in lqc there are strong quantum gravity effects in the super - inflation phase as well as in the phase that follows immediately after super - inflation .",
    "these could well have spoiled the attractor behavior and a large fraction of the data _ specified at the bounce _ could well have given rise to trajectories that steer away from the wmap region .",
    "that this does not happen is noteworthy .",
    "the attractor behavior is a qualitative feature of dynamics .",
    "it does not provide a sharp _ quantitative _ estimate on the likelihood of realizing the desired slow roll . to obtain this estimate",
    ", one needs a _ measure _ on the space of ( physically distinct ) solutions , such that the total volume of this space is finite .",
    "as explained in section [ s1 ] , a natural strategy @xcite is to use the liouville measure on the phase space .",
    "this leads to _ a priori _ probabilities of events , such as the occurrence of the desired slow roll .",
    "however , volume of the 2-dimensional space @xmath11 of solutions with respect to the resulting @xmath219 is infinite .",
    "but this infinity is physically spurious : it occurs because @xmath11 is acted upon by a gauge group @xmath17 and the length of 1-dimensional orbits of @xmath17 is infinite . for a large class of potentials",
    "the space @xmath18 of physically distinct solutions is in fact a _ bounded _ interval of the real line .",
    "furthermore there is a natural 1-form @xmath220 on @xmath11 ( constructed from the symplectic structure and the gauge vector field @xmath221 ) which is everywhere orthogonal to @xmath222 .",
    "so it is a natural candidate to induce a volume element on the 1-dimensional space @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , it does not project down to @xmath18 ( because @xmath223 ) .",
    "therefore one is led , instead , to ` fix a gauge ' , i.e. , lift @xmath18 to a suitable 1-dimensional cross - section in @xmath11 and carry out integration there .",
    "the problem in general relativity is that there is no natural family of lifts and the volume element on @xmath18 depends heavily on one s choice .",
    "thus , there is an inherent ambiguity in the calculation of probabilities .",
    "thanks to the existence of the bounce surface , in lqc one does have a natural family of lifts and the probability of occurrence of physical events is independent of the choice .",
    "we used this choice to calculate the a priori probability of realizing the desired slow roll , compatible with the wmap data .",
    "we found that the probability is _",
    "greater than _ 0.999997 in lqc . as emphasized in section [ s1 ] , these are just ` bare probabilities ' and better estimates of this occurrence will require astutely chosen physical inputs .",
    "this will require not only a more complete theory @xcite , but a deep understanding of that theory to separate essential inputs from non - essential ones .",
    "however , since the ` bare probability ' is so close to 1 , it is a huge burden on any theory to come up with new inputs that significantly change the answer .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our results should not be interpreted to mean that sufficiently long slow roll inflation is inevitable in lqc : it is inevitable _ only _ under the additional assumption that there is a phase in which matter density is dominated by that of a scalar field in a suitable potential .",
    "so far lqc has not provided a mechanism to create either the scalar field or the potential .",
    "although there have been intriguing suggestions that this may naturally occur if one promotes the barbero immirzi parameter @xmath21 of loop quantum gravity to a dynamical field @xcite , very substantial work is needed to have confidence that they can be transformed into a concrete , internally complete and viable scenario .",
    "the primary purpose of our analysis was to understand what lqc has to say about inflationary scenarios in the early universe .",
    "but it is instructive to compare and contrast the predictions of lqc with those of general relativity , discussed in the literature .",
    "this leads us to several distinct points .",
    "first , there is some controversy as to which ` problems ' inflation solves and which it does not @xcite .",
    "our analysis does not shed any new light on these issues .",
    "rather , as mentioned above , our focus is on the likelihood of the desired slow roll inflation .",
    "second , while some of the literature @xcite uses the liouville measure on the space of solutions to compute the a priori probability , in @xcite ( and in the earlier literature cited therein ) a different measure is used .",
    "the likelihood , of course , can and does depend sensitively on the choice of the measure .",
    "in addition , since the choice made in @xcite is not preserved by the hamiltonian flow , a choice of time slice is made .",
    "therefore , there is some discussion in the literature on the dependence of the final results on the choice of the measure and the time slice used in the evaluation of probabilities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the liouville measure is ` canonical ' and , furthermore , preserved under time evolution .",
    "however , as explained above , the total measure on the space of solutions @xmath11 is infinite and , to extract meaningful probabilities , one must introduce an additional structure , a suitable lift of @xmath18 into @xmath11 .",
    "conceptually , this is equivalent to fixing a ` time gauge , ' e.g. by working with the initial data of the solution at the instant at which the matter density is a given constant , @xmath224 . in this sense",
    ", there is a common limitation . in @xcite ( and in earlier works dating back to @xcite )",
    "one uses the time slice at planck time ( but still works with equations of general relativity ) , while in @xcite it is argued that one should use a slice corresponding to a _ much _ later time .",
    "even if one were to decide to use the liouville measure , a priori probabilities do depend sensitively on this choice because of the nature of inflationary dynamics @xcite . from our perspective , since there is no ` canonical ' choice of time slice in general relativity , calculations of probabilities have an inherent ambiguity . in lqc , by contrast , since the bounce surface provides a canonical ` time slice ' the ambiguity can be naturally resolved .",
    "finally , recently there have been several interesting discussions of inflationary scenarios in lqc ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the primary focus of all but one of these papers is on phenomenological and observational issues rather than on measures and calculations of probabilities .",
    "the one exception is @xcite . however , in that reference , super - inflation ( as well as the bounce ) was ignored .",
    "we will conclude with an observation on dynamics immediately following the bounce . in the standard inflationary scenarios ,",
    "matter density is some 11 - 12 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath225 at the onset of inflation and from the quantum equations of full lqc we know that the use of quantum field theory in curved space - times is fully justified in this regime .",
    "however , there are several conceptually important issues which require an understanding of dynamics _ before _ this era is reached .",
    "perhaps the most important among them is the issue of the initial state of quantum fields representing perturbations .",
    "as explained in section [ s1 ] , currently the state is simply postulated to be the bunch - davis vacuum for the relevant modes ( which have co - moving wave numbers in the range @xmath226 ) . while this assumption is physically motivated , it is nonetheless important to arrive at this state starting from more fundamental initial conditions .",
    "in general relativity , these conditions would have to be specified on the singularity and furthermore we know that we can not reliably use equations of general relativity in the planck regime .",
    "lqc on the other hand is based on loop quantum gravity , a candidate theory of full quantum gravity . therefore , not only is there a basis to trust its quantum equations but , as we saw in section [ s2 ] , they have already provided us a wealth of new information on physics at the planck scale .",
    "therefore , there is good motivation to use quantum field theory on the cosmological _ quantum space - times _ of lqc @xcite to study the initial conditions and evolution of quantum fields representing perturbations from the big bounce until the onset of inflation .",
    "is there perhaps a natural initial condition we can impose on the quantum state of these perturbations at the bounce using e.g. , ideas developed in @xcite and/or exploiting the fact that the hubble parameter vanishes there ?",
    "what would such an initial state evolve to at the onset of slow roll ?",
    "would it be sufficiently close to the bunch - davis vacuum ( for the modes of interest ) to be phenomenologically viable , or , would it be so different that it is already ruled out observationally ? if it close , is it perhaps too close to be observationally indistinguishable from the bunch - davis vacuum or is it sufficiently different to lead to an observational test of lqc ?",
    "these questions are being currently analyzed using the detailed dynamics of the lqc inflationary space - times presented in section [ s4.2 ] @xcite .    finally ,",
    "because almost all lqc solutions are compatible with the wmap data , one might first think that the chances of constraining quantum gravity from observations of the early universe are very small .",
    "however this is not correct : to make contact with these observations one needs not only the ` background ' space - time but also quantum fields representing perturbations off this background .",
    "considerations of the previous paragraph suggest a concrete direction to confront quantum field theory on the lqc quantum space - times with observations .",
    "such a confrontation could well lead to interesting , testable predictions of loop quantum gravity and/or constraints on this theory .",

    "<S> inflationary models of the early universe provide a natural mechanism for the formation of large scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> this success brings to forefront the question of naturalness : does a sufficiently long slow roll inflation occur generically or does it require a careful fine tuning of initial parameters ? in recent years there has been considerable controversy on this issue @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , for a quadratic potential , kofman , linde and mukhanov @xcite have argued that the probability of inflation with at least 65 e - foldings is close to one , while gibbons and turok @xcite have argued that this probability is suppressed by a factor of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we first clarify that such dramatically different predictions can arise because the required measure on the space of solutions is intrinsically ambiguous in general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that this ambiguity can be naturally resolved in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) because the big bang is replaced by a big bounce and the bounce surface can be used to introduce the structure necessary to specify a satisfactory measure .    </S>",
    "<S> the second goal of the paper is to present a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics of lqc using analytical and numerical methods . by combining this information with the measure on the space of solutions , </S>",
    "<S> we address a sharper question than those investigated in @xcite : what is the probability of a sufficiently long slow roll inflation _ which is compatible with the seven year wmap data _ ? </S>",
    "<S> we show that the probability is very close to @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the material is so organized that cosmologists who may be more interested in the inflationary dynamics in lqc than in the subtleties associated with measures can skip that material without loss of continuity .    </S>",
    "<S> key words : loop quantum gravity , cosmology , inflation , measures , probability , wmap 7 year data . </S>"
