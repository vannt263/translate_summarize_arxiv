    "a remarkable feature of the physics of semiconductor materials is the possibility of designing and manufacturing artificial structures in which the electrons can be confined in zero , one , and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the region of confinement , usually called quantum system , is coupled to contacts through tunneling barriers which assure the dominance of the quantum effects in the transport phenomena .",
    "due to the coupling to the electrons in the fermi sea of each contact the discrete electronic states of the isolated quantum system become resonant states @xcite .",
    "they are special states of the continuum spectrum associated with a maximum of nonzero width of the electronic probability distribution density .",
    "the resonance width reflects the open character of the quantum system in semiconductor nanostructures and gives a measure of the coupling strength between the quantum system and contacts .",
    "the resonances can be directly seen in the transport properties of nanostructures giving reason to call the transport through this special type of mesoscopic structures as resonant @xcite .    in 1970",
    "easki and tsu @xcite have proposed for the first time a semiconductor structure where electronic transport proceeds via a resonant tunneling process and after that in 1973 they have also proposed a model @xcite to calculate the current density through the considered system .",
    "these were the first steps which have opened an extremely rich field for basic and applied research .",
    "the resonant transport has been investigated in a multitude of different mesoscopic semiconductor systems@xcite : two dimensional electron gas , quantum point contacts , quantum wires and quantum dots .",
    "many phenomena such as universal conductance fluctuations @xcite , the aharonov - bohm oscillations @xcite , the quantum hall effect @xcite , the quantized conductance in ballistic point contacts @xcite , coulomb blockade oscillations @xcite , chaotic dynamics in quantum dots @xcite , and kondo effect in single electron transistors @xcite , have been observed and discussed in the well - known theory pioneered by landauer and bttiker @xcite .",
    "the widely successful application of this formalism shows that electron transport through a mesoscopic system is quite similar to scattering in nuclear or atomic physics @xcite .",
    "the most important difference is that for transport the asymptotic motion of the electrons is determined by the different potential levels in the contacts and therefore is not free as in the nuclear reaction theory . in turn , the spherical symmetry of the problem is broken and the methods to solve the scattering problem can not be directly imported from the theory of nuclear reactions .",
    "the peculiarities of the scattering potential require a new theoretical description of the scattering phenomena appropriate for the transport .",
    "in this theory not only the values of the potential in the contacts should be taken into consideration , but also the strength of the coupling between the quantum system and the contacts .",
    "recent research on fano resonances in the conductance of a single electron transistor @xcite , on fluctuations of the local density of states in the emitter @xcite and on luttinger liquid behavior in ballistic transport through quantum wires @xcite , has established the importance of the interaction of the quantum system with the contacts . as an effect of this interaction",
    "the line shape of the resonant profile is asymmetric and can not be described by the common wigner - breit distribution anymore .",

    "[ res ] presents an analytical theory of the quasi - isolated transport resonances , and the signature of these resonances in the conductance and capacitance measurements performed on semiconductor nanostructures is identified .",
