    "globular clusters are compact stellar systems , each containing of order @xmath3 stars , that orbit around the centres of galaxies out to large radii . our galaxy hosts around 200 globular clusters and observations show that almost all galaxies host these systems , with giant ellipticals having the largest ( relative ) population @xcite .",
    "stellar population studies have revealed that globular clusters have ages up to @xmath4gyrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that they formed within @xmath5 billion years of the big bang and so they represent fossil records of the earliest epoch of galaxy formation , which has led to much interest in their potential as probes of the high redshift universe @xcite .    however , we have as yet no compelling theory for globular cluster formation and evolution within a cosmological framework and this has important consequences for the kind of questions we can address using globular clusters and the strength of conclusions that we can draw .",
    "one particularly important consequence concerns the disruption of primordial globular clusters and the relation of the high redshift globular cluster population to the population that we observe at the present day .",
    "all star clusters lose mass over time and this depends on a number of factors including initial conditions ( e.g. initial mass profile of the star cluster , initial mass function of the stars , initial binary fraction ) , internal processes within the cluster ( e.g. mass segregation , stellar mass loss ) , the orbital parameters of the cluster and the form and nature of the external tidal field within which the cluster orbits .",
    "the globular cluster population that we observe around galaxies at the present day has survived a hubble time , but it is interesting to ask whether or not this population is representative of the primordial globular cluster population at high redshift . if not , this would imply that many primordial globular clusters disrupted on relatively short timescales , and that the clusters that survived to the present day are in a sense atypical .",
    "this introduces certain caveats where the present day population is used to probe , say , the efficiency of star formation at high redshifts @xcite and the epoch of cosmological reionisation @xcite .    in the standard picture of galaxy formation",
    ", galaxies are embedded in massive virialised structures or halos of dark matter @xcite .",
    "these dark matter halos assemble over time hierarchically , continuously growing via accretion of dark matter and merging with other halos from high redshift to the present day .",
    "the subset of globular clusters that have survived to the present day has evolved in a time - dependent and at times violently changing potential provided by its host galaxy and dark matter halo .",

    "@xcite looked at the early evolution of globular clusters formed in dark matter halos but employed softened gravitational potentials for both the stars and dark matter .",
    "as such , the explicit presence of a dark matter halo has been neglected to date in direct @xmath0-body models of star cluster evolution .",
    "our goal is to understand how the presence of a dark matter halo affects the internal characteristics of star clusters in general  and globular clusters in particular  and their disruption rates .",
    "for the former our interest is in signatures such as the ratio of the core to half - mass radii and the velocity dispersion , which may be compared to observations of star clusters .",
    "however , in this paper , the first in a series , we start by focusing on the rate of mass - loss from model star clusters and what this can tell us about the expected lifetimes and disruption of globular clusters .",
    "our approach is to use a direct @xmath0-body code that treats the internal processes of a star cluster in as detailed a manner as possible .",
    "we include a spectrum of stellar masses and stellar evolution from the outset as the effect of these on star cluster evolution is relatively well understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our treatment of the external potential and the orbits of the model clusters within this ,",
    "we take a more cautious approach .",
    "we start with the simplest case , circular orbits in a variety of static potentials , as this facilitates comparison with previous @xmath0-body studies and provides the foundation for our study . in the future we will expand the models to include eccentric orbits and time - varying potentials . by necessity",
    "we also start with models more comparable in size to open clusters than globular clusters but this will also increase as we progress . in this way we build a consistent and realistic picture of star cluster evolution and survival .",
    "we assess the influence of halo structure on mass loss rate using the functional form for the mass profile proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) .",
    "the nfw profile has been found to provide a good description of the spherically averaged dark matter distribution within halos in dynamical equilibrium in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the characteristic feature of the nfw profile is that it has a central density cusp , @xmath6 , so that the central density is divergent .",
    "we also construct a three - component model of our galaxy consisting of a bulge , disk and nfw halo and we compare the rate at which clusters lose mass in this model against the rate measured in the fiducial model of the galactic tidal field , based on oort constants .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the nfw profile in more detail , while in section  [ cluster_model ] we describe the model we have adopted for our star cluster . in section  [ results ] we present the main results of our study , first considering the evolution of an isolated cluster ; then the evolution of the cluster in external galactic potentials ; then evolution in the potential of a nfw halo ; and finally evolution in our three - component model of a galactic potential , which consists of a bulge , disk and nfw halo .",
    "finally we discuss the main findings and implications of our study in section  [ summary ] .",

    "* ) and asymmetric ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they have no simple boundary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they contain a wealth of small scale structure @xcite . despite this complexity , however , it is conventional to identify a halo as a spherical overdense region , typically of order 100 times the mean density of the universe .",
    "the mass enclosed within this spherical overdensity defines the _ virial mass _ of the halo ,    @xmath7    here @xmath8 is the critical density of the universe and @xmath9 is the _ virial radius _ , which defines the radial extent of the halo .",

    "it should also be noted that the plummer profile formally extends to infinite radius so a cut - off at 10 times the half - mass radius is applied to deal with rare cases of large distance @xcite . to save computing time we did not run full globular cluster models ( i.e. @xmath35 ) .",
    "instead we focus on models of @xmath36 stars . for one galaxy scenario we also ran @xmath37 simulations in order to investigate the scaling of the results with @xmath0 .",

    "the average stellar mass is @xmath41 . in general our clusters",
    "are placed on circular orbits in the stellar disk ( if present ) at a radius of @xmath32kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "this facilitates comparison with previous studies .",
    "however , we do briefly explore the effect of orbital distance by placing some clusters on orbits at radii of 4.5 , 17 and @xmath42kpc .",
    "an overview of our models used in terms of the treatment of the external tidal field is shown in table [ tb : models ] .",
    "our first model ( model 1 ) is a cluster in isolation .",
    "its dynamical evolution depends only on internal processes such as mass segregation and stellar evolution .",
    "the evolution of the total mass of such a cluster is shown in figure [ fig : mass123 ] by the heavy solid curve . in nbody6",
    "the cluster size is limited by a tidal radius or cut - off radius . for the case of an isolated cluster",
    "it is not meaningful to define a tidal radius and so we adopt a cut - off radius of 10 times the cluster scale length @xmath15 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 the total cluster mass and @xmath45 the potential energy .",
    "note that @xmath15 is distinct from the nfw scale radius discussed in section  [ nfw_profile ] .",
    "stars with cluster - centric radii in excess of twice the cut - off radius are considered to have left the cluster and contribute to the mass loss .",
    "the initial cut - off radius is @xmath46pc , but this increases as the cluster expands to about @xmath47pc after @xmath34gyr .",
    ".,width=340 ]    mass segregation causes the system to lose stars early on .",
    "less massive stars gain kinetic energy through equipartition during encounters with more massive stars in the core and are more likely to escape .",
    "stellar evolution leads to the loss of even more mass in the early stages .",
    "massive stars evolve more rapidly than low mass stars and hence lose mass more quickly in the form of stellar winds .",
    "neutron stars that form in a supernova will get a velocity kick and generally disappear from the system .",
    "model 2 introduces the standard galactic tidal field ( sgtf ) based on the local oort constants ( @xmath48 km / s , @xmath49 km / s ) .",
    "these are derived empirically from the observed motions of stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite . as such they naturally account for the local effect of the total mass of the galaxy ( including its dark matter halo ) and they strictly apply to orbits within the region of the solar neighbourhood . from the local circular velocity we can infer that the enclosed mass at an orbit of @xmath32kpc ( the distance from the sun to the galactic centre ) is @xmath50 . as the dashed curve in figure [ fig : mass123 ] shows this has a profound effect on the mass loss of the cluster .",
    "there is an almost continuous mass loss leading to rapid disruption of the cluster : simulations are halted when the cluster has less than 25 stars left . here",
    "we define the tidal radius as the @xcite tidal radius , @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 the masses of the cluster and the galaxy respectively and @xmath54 the distance between the galactic centre and the centre of the cluster .",
    "we set @xmath55kpc ( the distance from our sun to the galactic centre ) .",
    "this gives a tidal radius of @xmath56pc , smaller than the cut - off radius used in model 1 .",
    "this has a bearing on what we compute as the mass loss rate , which will be lower in the case of the isolated cluster where the cut - off radius is higher .",
    "however , stellar evolution effects dominate in the isolated cluster so the general comparison holds .      model 3 introduces the two - component model of the galaxy , consisting of a bulge and disk . the disk is modelled as a miyamoto - nagai disk @xcite and the bulge is a point mass at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "we use a mass of @xmath57 for the disk , which has a radius of @xmath58kpc , and @xmath59 for the bulge , as suggested by @xcite for the milky way .",
    "we adopt a tidal radius of @xmath60pc , equal to the king radius ( see equation [ eq : king ] ) of model 2 .",
    "this is kept fixed for all subsequent models at an orbital distance of @xmath32kpc , including the models where we add a dark matter halo .",
    "thus we are effectively employing a tidal cut - off as described by @xcite .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : mass123 ] shows the evolution of the cluster mass with model 3 acting as the external tidal field .",
    "model 3 does not produce a tidal field as strong as the sgtf of model 2 , but this is to be expected because the mass of the combined bulge and disk within @xmath32kpc is smaller than the enclosed mass one infers for the sgtf of model 2 , which is @xmath61 . recall that model 2 is based on an empirical estimate of the galactic tidal field and",
    "so implicitly includes the contribution of the galaxy s dark matter halo , whereas model 3 has no halo contribution .",
    "the two - component model is attractive because we can fully determine how the galactic potential is modelled and explore different sets of assumptions , but it neglects the presence of dark matter halo component to the potential which we expect to be important .",
    "in contrast , the sgtf model provides a realistic model of the galactic potential in the solar neighbourhood , being derived from empirical measurement , but the conditions under which it is applicable are restrictive .",
    "if the two - component model is to be made more realistic , then it must become a three - component model ( a bulge , disk and halo ) , in which case we expect the mass loss rates for models 2 and 3 to converge . in the next subsection",
    "we look at the influence of a single component model  that of a nfw dark matter halo on the mass loss rate  before introducing the three - component model in the final subsection .",
    "kpc from the halo centre ( model 4 ) .",
    "we show here three different virial masses : @xmath62 ( green ) , @xmath63 ( blue ) and @xmath64 ( red ) ; each with three different concentrations : @xmath65 ( solid ) , @xmath66 ( dashed ) and @xmath67 ( dotted ) .",
    "the solid black line is model 1 , the cluster in isolation , and is drawn here as a reference.,width=340 ]      we now consider a set of models in which our star clusters orbit in a nfw dark matter halo ( model 4 ) .",
    "for now we ignore the stellar component of the galaxy because we want to investigate the influence of changing the nfw parameters of mass and concentration .",
    "we use a model grid of 6 different halo virial masses ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath64 ) and 3 concentrations ( 5 , 10 and 15 ) , thus 18 models in total . here",
    "we define the virial mass as in equation  [ eq : mvir ] with an overdensity criterion of @xmath73 .",
    "each cluster follows a circular orbit at a distance of @xmath32kpc from the centre of the halo .",
    "this is achieved by giving the cluster an initial circular velocity equal to the halo velocity at that distance , @xmath74 our main set of simulations start with 1000 stars with a salpeter imf in the mass range @xmath75 and total mass of @xmath76 .",
    "figure [ fig : massniii8 ] shows the evolution of the mass of the cluster . for clarity we only show 9 of the models representing the lowest mass , intermediate mass and highest mass halos .",
    "the mass loss is initially the same for all models since in this stage it is dominated by stellar evolution of the most massive stars . after about @xmath47myr clusters in the most massive halos keep losing mass at a faster pace than the clusters in the less massive halos . in these massive halos",
    "the effect of concentration is also clearly visible .",
    "higher concentrations mean faster disruptions  more of the halo mass is concentrated within the cluster s orbit resulting in a greater tidal force on the cluster .",
    "the effects of concentration become negligible for the least massive halos , and it is also noteworthy that mass loss is very similar for the low- and intermediate - mass halos .    [",

    "the nfw profile can be characterised by a single parameter , its concentration , which provides a measure of how rapidly the logarithmic slope changes with radius and consequently how rapidly the radial force changes with radius . as expected , star clusters orbiting at a fixed physical radius lose mass at a higher rate in more massive halos and in more concentrated halos",
    ".    we also investigated a three - component model of the galactic tidal field , consisting of a stellar bulge and disk and a nfw halo and compared the mass loss rates of star clusters orbiting in this potential against mass loss rates of clusters orbiting in a standard galactic tidal field ( sgtf ) .",

    "these numbers are reasonable and consistent with what one would expect for galactic - type dark matter halos in cosmological simulations . by building multi - component models of galactic potentials",
    ", one can explore many questions of cluster evolution that have not necessarily been possible before ( such as the disruption timescales of clusters on eccentric orbits ) .",
    "our results are interesting because they highlight the importance of including an underlying dark matter halo in @xmath0-body simulations of long - term globular cluster evolution .",
    "previous studies have neglected to do this , but as we have shown , the halo can have a profound effect on the lifetime of the star cluster .",

    "as we have noted in the introduction , we would expect a realistic halo to have had an active and at times violent mass assembly history , which should be an important additional driver of mass loss in our clusters .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear what effect the assembly of the galaxy would have on the structure of the underlying dark matter halo .",
    "nevertheless , our general conclusions hold and the effect of non - circular orbits and an evolving halo will be qualified as we continue our study .",
    "our results raise a number of interesting questions .",
    "the favoured cosmological model predicts that galaxies should live in cuspy dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "previous studies of globular cluster evolution have been of clusters that evolve in non - cuspy potentials .",
    "inferences have been drawn from these simulations of general processes such as core - collapse and mass - segregation and observations of globular clusters , which the simulations seem to do a good job of reproducing .",
    "we do not appear to need cuspy dark matter halos to produce these these trends in simulated globular clusters that are consistent with observational data , so does this imply that cuspy dark matter halos are not needed at all ?",
    "this is not straightforward to answer , because it is not understood how the assembly of the galaxy has affected its dark matter halo , and whether this has effectively wiped out the cusp ( as would appear necessary from rotation curve studies of dark matter dominated galaxies ) .",
    "however , if cusps are robust in the presence of the growing galaxy , then it may have implications for our understanding of globular cluster evolution .",
    "more speculatively , the enhanced rate of disruption of clusters in cuspy halos has interesting implications for their use as probes of galaxy formation . understanding",
    "how efficiently globular clusters form should provide us with insight into the efficiency of galaxy formation at high redshifts .",
    "the number of old globular clusters today could tell us how plentiful the sites of globular cluster formation were in the past , which in turn tells us about the efficiency with which gas cooled and formed molecular clouds .",
    "these sites may be regulated by the location ( in the disks of gas - rich proto - galaxies , in mergers between gas - rich proto - galaxies ) or the ambient radiation field ( cosmological reionisation ) .",
    "if globular clusters are disrupted more efficiently in cuspy halos , then we could be missing a large fraction of globular clusters thus misinterpreting observations and drawing even more uncertain conclusions .",
    "these are interesting questions and ones that we aim to revisit in coming papers .",
