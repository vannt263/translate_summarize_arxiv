    "we report on an unbiased survey of the cygnus x ( cyg  x ) high - mass star formation region , conducted in 2005 by the balloon - borne large aperture submillimeter telescope ( blast ) , a 2-m stratospheric telescope that maps simultaneously at 250 , 350 , and 500  @xcite .",
    "a primary ambition for blast was to study the earliest stages of massive protostellar evolution .",
    "massive stars play an important role in galactic ecology , initially through protostellar outflows and later through radiation pressure , ionization , stellar winds , and supernova explosions , and yet , in spite of their pivotal role , very little is known about their formation @xcite .",
    "massive molecular clouds are favorable sites for massive star formation .",
    "if they are sufficiently dense to be self - gravitating , then they also have high extinction . even in the near to mid",
    "infrared they have significant optical depth , affecting observations of any embedded protostars , and leading to the `` infrared dark cloud '' ( irdc ) phenomenon seen by iso @xcite , _ msx _  @xcite , and _ spitzer _",
    "_ irac _  and mips  @xcite .",
    "some irdcs are nurseries of young protostellar objects and protoclusters @xcite .",
    "however , irdcs , by definition found in silhouette , require a luminous diffuse background .",
    "massive clouds can be discovered directly , without this detection bias , by their far - infrared to mm - wave optically - thin thermal dust emission .",
    "blast exploits this fact .",
    "we introduce the blast imaging of cyg  x  in   [ imaging ] .",
    "blast detects thermal emission from dust in largely neutral regions and so provides a complementary view of the interstellar medium ( ism ) compared to , for example , radio emission from ionized gas (   [ free - free ] ; though both are ultimately dependent on the local stellar radiation field and so are related spatially in some predictable ways ) .",
    "an important feature of blast imaging is its capability of observing and characterizing extended structures in the star - forming environment at different spatial scales (    [ structures ] and [ sec : diffuse ] ) . in    [ sources ] and [ blastphot ] we describe the identification and quantification of blast compact sources .",
    "appendix  [ multiphot ] discusses measurement of their flux densities at different wavelengths for use in the multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "blind submillimeter surveys with blast @xcite , precursors to those with _ herschel _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) , are ideally suited for finding and characterizing cold sources , because of the designed coverage near the peak of the cold dust spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "this allows us to determine where the dust temperature @xmath3 is low , a key requirement before determining the cold dust column densities and masses .",
    "blast of course also sees the later evolutionary stages when the dust is warmed up by the forming protostars , and again the multi - wavelength coverage tightly constrains both dust temperature and bolometric luminosity ( @xmath4 ) .    in order to interpret the blast emission more fully , and place the compact sources in context , we make use of many different surveys of cyg  x  in other tracers , including both continuum emission and molecular lines . these rich multi - wavelength , multi - species surveys of cyg  x  are the basis of a brief overview of the physical environment in   [ overview ] .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and deduced properties @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and mass @xmath1 of the compact sources are presented in   [ compact ] . as we discuss in ",
    "[ sec : lum ] , the mass of the compact source , along with its luminosity ( which maps into @xmath3 ) , determine its position on an evolutionary track in the @xmath0-@xmath1  diagram @xcite . investigating the stages of high mass protostellar and protocluster evolution",
    "is a prime aspect of this paper .    in the earliest stages , before there is any ( significant ) internal source of energy from accretion or nuclear burning , the dust is heated only by the external radiation field . because of the high extinction the dust is cold , with @xmath3 typically @xmath5  k or lower , but in any case colder than the `` ambient '' temperature of diffuse dust in the same external radiative environment ( which near these star forming molecular clouds might be much more intense than the local interstellar radiation field ) .",
    "such cold clouds , and the initial gravitationally - bound condensations within them are therefore rather invisible to _ iras _ , but are in principle detectable by blast and ground - based surveys targeting regions of high extinction ( e.g. , @xcite using mambo  at 1.2  mm ) . according to the time sequence and nomenclature used for low mass star formation , sources detected in this earlier evolutionary stage could be called `` class @xmath6 . ''",
    "however , as a reminder of the energetics , we prefer the physically - motivated shorthand `` stage e '' ( from externally heated , but also usefully earliest  see   [ sec : early ] ) .",
    "likewise , we call sources in the subsequent evolutionary stage , when there is sufficiently vigorous accretion power internally to raise the dust to the ambient or higher temperature , `` stage a '' ( see   [ sec : accretion ] ; the low mass analog would be `` class 0 '' ) .",
    "an illustrated view of the evolutionary stages of massive star formation , illuminated from the blast submillimeter perspective , is presented in ",
    "[ evol ] .",
    "a key factor that is important to the interpretation of our particular observations is that massive stars form in stellar groups and star clusters @xcite .",
    "the approximately 1  angular resolution ( fwhm ) of the blast images corresponds to 0.5  pc at 1.7  kpc .",
    "this is the size scale ( sometimes called a `` clump '' ",
    "@xcite ) of the observed embedded and newly - emerging clusters in cyg  x  ( @xcite ;   [ clusters ] ) .",
    "thus it is relatively straightforward to search for the precursors to these protoclusters , within which massive protostars will be the dominant source of luminosity and ionizing radiation .",
    "however , resolving protoclusters into unconfused condensations ( a smaller linear scale sometimes called `` cores '' ) that are destined to form single ( proto)stars requires more angular resolution than has been available in surveys ( even with the 11  beam of mambo2 which is smaller than achieved here with blast ) .",
    "submillimeter observations with the larger telescope of _ herschel _ will be better ( 18  at 250  with the spire camera ) , but not immune to these considerations .",
    "empirically , @xcite have made an extensive study of fragmentation and sub - fragmentation inside targeted molecular dense cores in the cyg  x  region with interferometric observations at plateau de bure .",
    "theoretically , it is still unclear how clusters containing massive stars form @xcite .",
    "some insight provided by the blast observations and ancillary data , coupled with current theory is the focus of the discussion in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "cyg  x , positioned in the galactic plane at about @xmath7@xmath8  and about @xmath9  kpc away from the sun @xcite , has long been known for its massive star formation . with blast @xcite we surveyed 10 deg@xmath10 in cyg",
    "x  for 10.6 hr during the june 2005 flight ( blast05 ) , mapping the area on three visits to provide cross - linked scanning .",
    "in addition , a significant amount of calibration - related time was spent observing a circular cap of radius 1@xmath8  centred on w75n , resulting in even higher signal to noise and dynamic range there .",
    "final maps on 15  pixels were produced using the map - maker sanepic @xcite .",
    "the combination of high scan speed and low @xmath11 knee , together with the cross - linking and common - mode removal in sanepic , produces a map retaining diffuse low spatial frequency emission , in contrast to current ground - based mm - wave mapping which contends with the atmosphere and therefore is spatially filtered and emphasizes the compact structures .",
    "however , preprocessing of the time - ordered data to remove very low frequency drifts makes the sanepic map average near zero , the dc level having been effectively removed .",
    "blast05 was designed to produce diffraction - limited beams with fwhm 30 , 42 , and 60  at 250 , 350 , and 500  , respectively .",
    "however , blast05 suffered from an uncharacterized failure relating to the primary mirror figure and focus .",
    "nevertheless , even with the corrupted beam the resolution is about 3  full width half power @xcite , comparable to _ iras _ , though disappointing compared to the diffraction - limited images obtained in the 2006 flight ( @xcite ) .    the characteristic beam shape can be seen clearly at many locations throughout the field , indicating the presence of point sources with angular size comparable to the diffraction limit .",
    "obviously we want to work with images with as good resolution as possible .",
    "we removed the worst effects of the corrupted beam ( see roy et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) by a lucy - richardson deconvolution algorithm @xcite .",
    "the significant improvement is illustrated in figure  [ fig : dmap ] .    .",
    "lower : deconvolved image using a lucy - richardson algorithm .",
    "full width half maxima of the deconvolved sources are about 1 . ]",
    "even so the effective resolution is about 1 , less dependent on wavelength than for diffraction ( which has the silver - lining benefit that beam matching is not an issue )",
    ". moreover , there are artefacts introduced near very strong sources .",
    "mathematically , lucy - richardson deconvolution should conserve flux , and we have verified this through simulations and measurements on isolated compact sources (   [ blastphot ] ) . the astrometric accuracy is good , about 5  when the deconvolved maps (   [ blastphot ] ) are aligned with compact sources in common with mambo2 @xcite and/or _ scuba _  @xcite .",
    "the full 250-  map is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : omap ] .",
    "blast measures the dust continuum emission along the line of sight and probes the major star - forming sites in the region by detecting reprocessed stellar or protostellar radiation .",
    "the positions of luminous stars in the cyg ob association @xcite and a number of stellar clusters (   [ clusters ] ) are indicated for reference .",
    "expanding  regions , bubbles , and stellar outflows , and the interplay with structures in the interstellar medium make the morphology of extended emission in the cyg  x  region quite complex .",
    "a comprehensive review covering important physical aspects of cyg  x  is presented by @xcite .",
    "a complementary way to see the effects of the high - energy radiation from hot massive stars is via radio emission from the ionized gas .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : omap ] shows the 21-cm continuum map from the cgps @xcite , which has 1  resolution , about the same resolution as the blast maps .",
    "a number of  regions are labelled for reference : numerals n are drn regions from @xcite , ecx6- * from @xcite , and otherwise g@xmath12 ( accurate coordinates for these three regions being g@xmath13 , g@xmath14 and g@xmath15 ) .",
    "note that the recombination line velocity for g79.9 is @xmath1614.8  kms@xmath17and for ecx6 - 27 is @xmath1664.4  kms@xmath17@xcite , putting these beyond the cyg  ob2 association .    in diffuse regions",
    "the free - free emission is optically thin , but for the most dense compact  regions , it can be self - absorbed .",
    "there is rough correspondence with the dust emission , as might be expected given the impact of ob star radiation on both .",
    "note , however , that unlike the dust emission , which depends on the column density , the  emission depends on the emission measure , involving the square of the local density .",
    "furthermore , ionizing radiation is obviously essential to produce the plasma .",
    "this radiation , the rest of the non - ionizing starlight , trapped lyman-@xmath18 , and cooling lines all heat any dust surviving in the plasma .",
    "most of the sub - ionizing radiation escapes the plasma to heat any dust outside the  region . in an edge - on geometry , as occurs in extended regions like dr22 , the warm dust immediately outside the arc - shaped ionization front ( i - front ) can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : omap ] and magnified views in figures below ) . in a related way , in dr23 the ionization",
    "is clearly stopped on the right by a dense cloud which forms a `` bay '' in the radio emission , and a corresponding bright feature in the dust map .",
    "there are also large scale ionized structures denoted cxrn ( cyg  x  ridges ) by @xcite .",
    "those in the blast region are labelled in figure  [ fig : omap ] .",
    "these are seen dimly in the blast image because they have relatively low column density ( they also do not show very strongly in the extinction map ;   [ extinction ] ) .",
    "a much better dust emission tracer (   [ structures ] ) of these ionized ridges , indeed of all of the diffuse ionized gas , is the 24  mips  image , from the _ spitzer _ cyg  x  legacy survey @xcite , which looks remarkably like the radio continuum image .      in the midst of this turmoil , we search for relatively cold structures which could be the precursors of the next generation of stars",
    "this is also the goal of the lower - resolution planck cold core survey @xcite , an unbiased search using the planck all - sky maps of submillimeter dust emission .",
    "cold cores are characterized by a lack of corresponding _ iras _  100  emission . because the planck high - frequency angular resolution is 4",
    ", clumps  even if more extended than the blast clumps  will appear as point sources , and smaller structures will be beam - diluted .",
    "even for relatively nearby regions like cyg  x , the planck beam would correspond to a spatial extent of about 2  pc .",
    "the highest - frequency planck channels correspond approximately to 350 and 500  .",
    "prior to the availability of planck imaging data , we explored the possibilities by convolving the two longer - wavelength blast images to the planck resolution and combining them with _",
    "iras_100  in a three - color image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : planck ] ) . at this resolution",
    ", blast stage e sources like c116 (   [ compact ] and   [ coldcloudsf ] ) still stand out as being cool .",
    "more extended , elongated structures like the cool irdc ridge near dr15 (   [ irdcs ] ) and the dr17 molecular pillar (   [ posters ] and   [ pillars ] ) are also preserved .",
    "of course the regions of warmer dust are highlighted in this image as well .",
    "blast maps measure surface brightness ( mjy sr@xmath17 ) , hence column density of the dust @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dust to gas ratio , @xmath22 is the h column density , and @xmath23 is the mass absorption coefficient of the dust . for later characterization of the sed",
    "we note that the spectral dependence of @xmath23 is usually scaled with respect to a fiducial frequency as @xmath24 .",
    "note also that for absolute measures of column density we would have to restore the zero point ( dc level ) of the maps , as we did for the cas  a region @xcite but not here .    in the galactic plane ,",
    "cirrus - like structures in the form of bright diffuse emission , termed `` interstellar froth '' @xcite , are distributed everywhere . with the compact structures removed , either explicitly or by clipping @xcite , the diffuse emission has a cirrus - like power spectrum , with lower fluctuations at high spatial frequencies .",
    "in fact , we have found that for this region the power spectrum is quite like that for _ iras _  100  , with amplitude simply scaled by the sed@xmath10 for the appropriate cirrus temperature @xcite .",
    "somehow , through turbulent motions , thermal instabilities , and phase transitions , massive localized regions become self - gravitating and so at high spatial frequencies they stand out from the dwindling cirrus structure as compact sources .",
    "a distribution of masses is expected , but the cirrus confusion limits our ability to distinguish lower mass sources (   [ sources ] ) .",
    "this situation improves with angular resolution , but even for _ herschel _ it is a dominant limitation @xcite .",
    "actually , the diffuse emission in the submillimeter and mid - infrared wavelengths comes from three different dust components , distinguished principally by their size distribution ( @xcite , compiegne et al .",
    ", in preparation ) : big grains ( bgs ) , very small grains ( vsgs ) , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "the bgs , which account for the most of the dust mass and therefore most of the longer wavelength emission , are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the vsgs have a relatively lower share of the total dust mass , even smaller in dense regions .",
    "they are small enough to experience non - equilibrium heating and so broaden the spectrum toward shorter wavelengths , beyond the spectral peak of the bg emission .",
    "compared to what is expected from equilibrium bgs alone , this excess non - equilibrium emission appears typically at 60  and shorter wavelengths .",
    "pahs are also non - equilibrium emitters , in strong spectral bands pumped by far - ultraviolet radiation .",
    "the relative amounts of emission in these three components can vary from region to region .",
    "@xcite used the _ msx _",
    "band a images ( 8.3  ; @xcite ) effectively as a tracer of pahs and the environment .",
    "we use _ spitzer _ _ irac _  band 4 images ( 8.6  ; @xcite ) from the cyg  x  legacy survey @xcite for the same purpose (   [ fuv ] ) , since they have better sensitivity and resolution .",
    "_ spitzer _ mips 24  images trace vsg emission generally , and the hotter grains associated with ionized gas , and so , as commented above , look remarkably like the radio continuum images .      from the above equation it is clear that the bg emission that blast sees is modulated by the dust temperature @xmath3 which is in equilibrium with the local radiation field , whether in the diffuse medium or within a compact source .",
    "we concentrate here on the former . for our exploratory work here on the bgs",
    ", we adopt a single - temperature sed and therefore fit only data at 100  and larger to avoid contamination by vsg emission .    for a sufficiently large and homogeneous region",
    "an estimate of the characteristic temperature can be obtained by fitting an sed to the square root of the amplitudes of power spectra . by this method using data at 100 , 250 , 350 , and 500  , @xcite obtained a cirrus dust temperature of 19.9@xmath251.3  k for a relatively uncrowded region ( basically the right half of the blast map ) . however , this more global power spectrum method is not practical when the region considered is relatively small , inhomogeneous , and/or focusing primarily on particular sub - structures .",
    "an alternative approach for smaller regions begins with pixel - by - pixel correlations of images with respect to some reference image ( here 250  ) .",
    "small scale structures are remarkably well correlated across the three blast bands .",
    "the slopes of these correlations describe the relative sed of the spatially - varying dust emission that is changing in common across these images . note that this approach can not give the dust temperature pixel by pixel ( that would require the dc offsets too ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission in each pixel is from dust of different temperatures along the line of sight , whereas our approach isolates and characterizes certain more localized spatial components .    for quantification of the size of the changes in temperature , we selected regions that appeared to have different colors in a map like figure  [ fig : planck ] .",
    "the first region , shown in 500  emission in the left panel of figure  [ fig : diffuse ] , is within the relative void created by the cyg ob2 stars , near cxr12 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : omap ] ) .",
    "here there is relatively strong 100 and 60  emission . when the sed ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_diffuse2 ] ) is fit using @xmath26 , which is consistent with the value adopted for the analyses of compact sources in this paper , the derived dust equilibrium temperature @xmath27  k. for @xmath28 , appropriate for local diffuse dust in the atomic gas at high latitudes @xcite , @xmath3 is 25.4@xmath252.3  k. this can be compared to the local high - latitude equilibrium temperature , 17.5  k. the higher @xmath3 in cyg  x  results from the much higher effective interstellar radiation field from the ob association .",
    "the ridge of warm dust emission and this particular selected warm region above and to the left are also prominent in diffuse  emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : omap ] ) and 24  emission , which supports the view that the local radiation field is high here .",
    "this region is particularly devoid of co emission (   [ molecules ] ) .",
    "however , the material emitting in the submillimeter must be neutral , because the associated extinction @xmath29 is up to 3 mag above the local background ( and is spatially well correlated with the blast emission ;   [ extinction ] ) . to the lower right of the cxr12 ridge ,",
    "the dust is cooler , and there is some co emission .",
    "cxr12 is oriented roughly tangentially to the direction to the center of the ob association , and might involve material swept up . however , the geometry is unclear , not immediately recalling a classical edge - on photodissociation region ( pdr ) in a molecular cloud .",
    "the selected cooler region , judged from relatively low 100 and 60  emission , is shown by a circle in the right panel of figure  [ fig : diffuse ] .",
    "its sed ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_diffuse2 ] ) yields an equilibrium temperature of 21.6 @xmath25 0.5  k. the lower @xmath3 would imply a lower effective interstellar radiation field , due to the high extinction , with @xmath30 for this molecular structure (   [ molecules ] ) up to 6 mag above the local background .",
    "when @xmath31 in equation  ( [ column ] ) is integrated over a suitable solid angle , accounting for the background , the flux density @xmath32 ( typically in jy ) of a `` source '' is obtained .",
    "likewise , the source mass @xmath1 ( gas plus dust ) is related to the integrated column density when the distance @xmath33 is known , so that @xmath34 note that `` source '' refers to the dust emission that is being observed , not what heats the dust , and so in particular does not imply that there is an embedded source of energy ( a star or protostar ) within the volume of dust being measured .    the definition and characterization of what is a compact source is a difficult challenge , and different extraction schemes , like clumpfind @xcite , gaussclump @xcite , or the multi - scale method of @xcite , can produce different catalogs and source characteristics .",
    "operationally what is called a `` compact source '' is often basically a structure comparable in size to the beam .",
    "this immediately cautions that what is a compact source to one instrument could become resolved into multiple components at higher resolution , as has been illustrated by submm / mm interferometric observations of _ iras _",
    "protoclusters and hot cores ( e.g. , with the sma and iram plateau de bure , @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , massive stars form in clusters .",
    "what blast can hope to detect in this survey at 1  resolution is unlikely to be a single protostar or its progenitor , but rather a protocluster or stellar nursery possibly containing many unresolved objects .",
    "of course , depending on the mass function , a single object among these might dominate the luminosity and ionizing flux .",
    "we have taken a pragmatic view that since whatever underlying structure that is smeared out as a compact structure does appear quite like a gaussian , this is an adequate model for extracting flux densities .",
    "furthermore , the deconvolved beam for this blast05 survey is of similar size at all three bands , so that the same volume of dust is being examined .",
    "a corollary is that when we use other initially higher - resolution data to expand the spectral coverage of multi - wavelength photometry ( appendix  [ multiphot ] ) , we measured the flux density consistently by first convolving these maps to the blast05 resolution .      for compact source identification we used the idl - implemented daophot `` find '' routine , keeping as candidates detected peaks that were above the local background in both the 250 and 350  images by @xmath35 ( empirical local rms fluctuation ) .",
    "both source identification and photometry on individual sources are affected by the presence of cirrus noise ; for example , at 250  the @xmath36 cirrus noise level was evaluated to be @xmath37  jy in the fainter right portion of the map @xcite , although it is expected to vary over the map according to the median brightness of the region ( making catalog completeness a function of position in the map ) .",
    "the 500  map was not productive for further independent identifications due to at least as great apparent relative confusion noise .",
    "in fact , for 14  faint sources among the above it was not possible to measure a reliable 500  flux density . given this noise and also the deconvolution artefacts near the brightest sources , we visually checked our candidates from the automated list .",
    "since we were not depending on a complete survey  for example , to find a mass function or relative lifetimes of different stages  we were conservative in rejecting sources and a few were even added to the list .",
    "we were most concerned with having sources with accurately determined seds , so that reliable physical parameters could be determined (   [ compact ] ) .",
    "photometry was carried out using a gaussian non - linear fit , with amplitude , fwhm , position , and linear background as free parameters .",
    "model - independent aperture photometry for isolated sources gave the same fluxes within 7% , confirming that this is an acceptable approach .",
    "cyg  x  has a sufficiently flat background locally that fitting a linear background is an adequate approximation .",
    "however , in a complex crowded star - forming region like much of cyg  x , it is often not possible to extract fluxes by aperture photometry or by fitting a single gaussian . in such cases",
    ", we adopted a multiple gaussian technique , fitting simultaneously to all candidates within a 2.5  radius about the parent source .",
    "if a parent source in a crowded region had a low signal to noise ratio compared to its neighbors then we fixed their positions and/or fwhms as required .",
    "positions and flux densities for 184 sources are given in table  [ tab : bsource ] .",
    "these cyg  x  sources are referred to below as ` cn ' where ` n ' is an up - to - three digit number , ranging from 0 to 183 .",
    "cyg  ob2 is among the more impressive assemblies of ob stars in the galaxy .",
    "it is more compact than a normal association and rich enough to have been called a `` young globular cluster '' @xcite .",
    "the latest census indicates that it contains some 60 - 70 o - type stars @xcite . from their semi -",
    "observational hr diagram , @xcite favor a distance 1.5  kpc , with 1.8  kpc being noticeably too large .",
    "our adopted distance of 1.7  kpc , consistent with @xcite and @xcite , is close to this and a 10% uncertainty in distance is of no consequence in the analysis that follows .",
    "the most luminous hot stars ( selected as @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) are plotted in figure  [ fig : omap ] with positions from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that star a37 ( at g80.240 + 0.135 ) has what appears to be a bow - shock to its right in the _ spitzer _ images and so might be a runaway star from lk8 in dr15 .",
    "@xcite studied the bow - shock morphology of a37 ( and others ) , placing this star slightly behind cyg  ob2 at a distance of 2.1  kpc .",
    "according to @xcite , cyg  ob2 extends to a radius of 1@xmath8  ( 30  pc ) , with half - light radius 13  ( 6.4  pc ) .",
    "examination of the sub - structure reveals two open clusters in the core ( bbd1 and bbd2 ; @xcite ) , each of radius @xmath42  yet separated by only 6  and appearing to form a physical pair .",
    "a number of highly reddened ob clusters and stellar groups have been found in the surrounding molecular clouds using 2mass .",
    "@xcite performed a targeted search toward large angular size  regions in cyg  x ; eight clusters and four stellar groups are in this blast survey region .",
    "five of these have been recovered and characterized by @xcite , including the half - population radius @xmath43 and central density .",
    "they also describe two new clusters .",
    "@xcite studied dr18 , finding a stellar group , and @xcite targeted other ecx @xcite compact  regions finding four clusters within the blast area .",
    "the new one , ecx6 - 27 , has a recombination line velocity of @xmath44  kms@xmath17  @xcite and so is much more distant than cyg  ob2 , more like 10  kpc .",
    "it has a `` double concentration '' of stars @xcite and also a complex double structure in the _ spitzer _ images .",
    "the catalog of @xcite also includes the w75n and dr21 ( w75s ) infrared clusters . in total",
    "there are thirteen clusters and five stellar groups ( see table  [ tab : clusters ] ) . their positions ( not extents )",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : omap ] , with names in precedence lk , db , and ecx6- * where the lists overlap . in subsequent figures , to indicate the cluster angular size we use @xmath43 for the ob star population where available @xcite , otherwise a radius of 1 .",
    "the signature of radio emission in this region of the galactic plane , as distinct from the radio galaxy cygnus a , led to the name cyg  x  @xcite .",
    "a more contemporary large scale view is given in figure  5 of @xcite .",
    "radio surveys conducted at different frequencies have catalogued the main  region complexes ( 1390 mhz , @xcite ; 5 ghz , @xcite ; multifrequency , @xcite ) .",
    "what we have observed with blast is only the central portion , all projected within the cygnus superbubble .",
    "the corresponding 1420  mhz image from the cgps , including the diffuse emission , is shown in figure  [ fig : omap ] .",
    "the free - free emission traces the compact sources and extended structures like i - fronts , elephant trunks and pillars , and material that is being sculpted by winds .",

    ", we detect sources of the size of `` clumps '' and furthermore even smaller angular - size high - mass `` cores '' are capable of forming multiple stars .",
    "this warns against a simple interpretation of this diagram based on single - star evolutionary tracks , although it is possible that once high mass stars form , the most massive will dominate the luminosity and ionization ( this will depend on the imf , star formation efficiency , and also small - number statistics ) .",
    "we think that the most illuminating way to think of pre - stellar evolution in this diagram is in terms of the energy source for the clump , which determines the appropriate equilibrium temperature @xmath3 for the approximate sed . in the very earliest stages",
    "being sought in submillimeter surveys , the energy source for the clumps is predominantly external , namely the impinging interstellar radiation field . in cyg",
    "x  the radiation field is in principle higher than in the local interstellar medium because of all the massive stars that have already formed , but this radiation is attenuated by the dusty molecular material in which the pre - stellar clumps are embedded .",
    "a useful point of reference is the equilibrium temperature corresponding to @xmath104 , which for the adopted @xmath70 and @xmath69 (   [ sec : sed ] ) is 16.2  k.    massive sources located below this @xmath100 locus ( see   [ sec : early ] ) still can have substantial @xmath0 by virtue of a lot of mass , but can not have any predominant internal source of energy ( either accretion or nuclear ) , and so could be called `` starless . ''",
    "this term is probably best avoided for these clumps , within which there might actually be a few low mass stars already forming and detectable by sensitive telescopes like _ spitzer _ (   [ sec : lowlm ] ) .",
    "the key consideration is what is the dominant source of energy determining @xmath3 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , these clumps could be said to be in stage e ( `` e '' for `` external '' or `` earliest '' ) , which seems to us a better terminology than `` starless , '' or `` class  @xmath6 '' for single - star pre - stellar cores .",
    "figure  [ fig : lm ] shows that there are many clumps in this stage .",

    "ultimately , nuclear fusion becomes the dominant source of power .",
    "unlike for low mass stars , massive pre - main sequence stars probably continue accreting after first beginning nuclear burning , increasing their mass further @xcite .",
    "when this accretion ends , an individual star is at its final position on the zams .",
    "it will still be embedded , and so optically obscured , but its vast power reprocessed will produce a relatively warm far - infrared source . for sufficiently massive stars , significant ionization of the surroundings will ensue , producing a hypercompact  region",
    ". there could be many within a single clump , for example @xcite .",
    "these clumps would appear in the @xmath107 diagram near the empirical nuclear burning locus ( see   [ sec : hii ] ) .",
    "as the massive stars clear their local environment through the expansion of the  region and via radiation pressure on dust ( successively ultracompact then compact  regions ) , the individual objects will become more extended far - infrared sources .",
    "the strong short - wavelength stellar radiation field will enhance both thermal emission and non - equilibrium emission from pahs in nearby photodissociation region material , making the sed of the integrated re - emission of the clump broader and more complex .",
    "evolution in the @xmath0-@xmath1  diagram will initially be at constant @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath1 ; ultimately , the optical depth and/or covering factor would decrease so that the reprocessed @xmath0 will fall .",
    "a stellar cluster with an extended  region would emerge .",
    "even though such clusters are found in cyg  x , they are not detected as compact blast sources and so do not appear in the @xmath0-@xmath1  diagram ; only objects like their precursors would .",

    "this characteristic surface density should be a marker of ( potential ) massive star forming regions , and there is some evidence consistent with this , at least for evolved objects . in the blast survey",
    "we find that the few most luminous sources containing compact  regions have such a high surface density .",
    "the mambo  cores containing compact  regions and mirqps with strong sio emission also have a high measured surface density ( table  [ tab : clump_cores ] ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite found an average surface density of 0.8  g  @xmath131 for dense cores of ultracompact  regions .",
    "we find that the typical surface density of massive embedded star clusters observed by @xcite in the cyg  x  region is about 1  g  @xmath131 ( allowing for the presence of some additional gas  now dispersed  in the precursor ) .",
    "an observed high @xmath83 associated with mysos might not be a signature unique to the turbulent core model , or even a prerequisite .",
    "in the simulations by @xcite of a competitive accretion model , `` massive stars were not formed from a single massive thermally supported fragment , but instead from a smaller core which accreted additional material channelled towards it by the potential of the forming stellar cluster . ''",
    "likewise , in the simulations by @xcite of a model of `` clump - fed massive star formation '' regulated by outflow feedback ( orcf ) , `` the most massive object is not formed out of a pre - existing dense core '' but rather `` is controlled by the global clump dynamics . ''",
    "recently @xcite observed a few of the massive young dense cores ( c107 , c115 , c119 , dr21(oh ) , dr21 ) in cyg  x  to study the kinematic properties of the underlying environment .",
    "they found that non - thermal support due to turbulence at the scale of the dense core is not enough for a quasi - static evolution of the massive protostars as predicted by the turbulent core model of @xcite , and they favor competitive accretion .",
    "therefore , a key question in investigating the mode of evolution is whether there is evidence for cold high-@xmath83 clumps or cores before high mass protostar(s ) , and even the preceding low - mass ysos , are established .",
    "even if the evolution timescale were favorably long , this is difficult with blast , as can be seen directly from equation  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) : at the spatial resolution of 0.5  pc about 4000  @xmath89  is needed to produce a surface density of 1  g  @xmath131 .",
    "we have noted that we do not see such massive cold objects ; if such dense cold objects do exist at lower mass , we can not identify them by directly measuring their true @xmath83 .",
    "higher resolution is required for such detections ; for example , mambo  observations at the resolution of 0.1  pc in cyg  x  need a mass of only 150  @xmath89  to produce equivalent contrast .",
    "the predominantly low surface densities obtained by @xcite suggest that even the _ herschel _ resolution is not sufficient for finding such dense sub - structures in most cold sources .      given the different theories",
    ", it is still unclear to us which of the low @xmath84 blast clumps will give rise to massive star formation .",
    "if there is a universal imf , then statistically a massive clump will be required to give birth to massive protostars .",
    "therefore , the massive clumps identified by blast are certainly of interest in this regard .",
    "naively , the evolution in the @xmath0-@xmath1  diagram would be vertical ( constant @xmath1 ) as the luminosity increases from accretion onto the massive protostar and then nuclear burning .",
    "even this is complicated because the power produced by low mass ysos in most theories can mask the earliest low @xmath0 stage of the massive protostar .",
    "however , it does not follow that massive clumps / cores always form massive stars .",
    "in fact , the model by @xcite explicitly predicts that this will not happen unless @xmath83 is above a critical value of about 1  g  @xmath131 .",
    "otherwise , their prediction is that the clump is destined to continue to produce only low mass stars , at some presumed steady - state rate .",
    "thus the vertical rise in @xmath0 is arrested at a ceiling for a given @xmath83 .",
    "we have marked such a possibility in figure  [ fig : lm2 ] with a horizontal red arrow at a level which would correspond to the sub - critical @xmath83 of the clump .",
    "the end result is a cluster or association of only low mass stars , i.e. , one with a truncated imf .",
    "because the precursor is of low @xmath83 the resulting assemblage of stars must be as well , making them more difficult to detect , and there is no high mass star to draw attention to the region by its high luminosity and ionization .",
    "the empirical context , a snapshot of the stages of evolution , is that there is a hierarchy of structures .",
    "blast identifies compact sources of size about 0.5 pc within the co clumps of spatial extent about 10  pc @xcite . within most of the blast clumps ,",
    "mambo  is able to find smaller and denser sub - structures of scale 0.1  pc .",
    "presumably these structures have been created and evolve by accumulating mass in the dynamical environment of the larger reservoir and possibly also simultaneously transfer mass to the immediately lower scale sub - structures . at",
    "any given time these structures will each have a characteristic @xmath83 .",
    "at some point does this become frozen in time so that we can discuss the fate of objects of fixed @xmath83 ? or tracking a clump , could @xmath83 and @xmath1 evolve , allowing evolution toward the upper right in the @xmath0-@xmath1  diagram ?",
    "we have indicated this latter possibility as well in figure  [ fig : lm2 ]  of course only schematically .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the competitive accretion model @xcite , and the orcf model @xcite which has features of both competitive accretion and the turbulent core model , show a channeling of mass to bound potential energy minima of the parsec - scale dense clumps studied , emphasizing the importance of clump - level dynamics . in these models ,",
    "when the material is cold it is more distributed and so would not be identified as a high mass , high @xmath83 , cold clump . by the time that mass builds up in massive cores , accreting on massive protostars , the compact source would have low mass ysos as well and have been warmed up .",
    "thus the cold precursors of dense clusters might be more extended objects than clumps , a massive reservoir yet to be channeled by gravity into a higher surface density state .",
    "some cold irdcs (   [ irdcs ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : planck ] ) , within which blast identifies substructure as sources , might fit into this scenario , but dynamical diagnostics would be needed to pursue the relevance of this possibility .",
    "an unbiased survey conducted by blast has enabled us to detect both compact sources and the embedding diffuse emission as a basis for studying the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "we have quantified contrasting dust temperatures of diffuse extended structures by correlating the fluctuating emission in _ iras _  and blast bands . to reveal the global morphology ,",
    "we have studied the relationship between dust continuum emission and radio , mid - infrared , and @xmath47co line emission . comparing the total mass present in the blast compact sources with the parent @xmath47co clump mass @xcite , we have obtained",
    "a linear correlation with slope of @xmath170 , which might be indicative of the star formation efficiency but also relates to the relative lifetime of the compact clump phase . with multi - wavelength photometry",
    "we have tightly constrained the dust emission seds of the compact sources to measure temperature , luminosity and mass .",
    "we have diagnosed the earliest stages of star formation in cyg  x , and the evolution , in the context of the luminosity  mass diagram of the compact sources .",
    "we have studied eight dr regions which are known as massive star formation sites in cyg  x. we have identified 16  sources which have compact  emission and found an average dust temperature of 33  k. not all of these identified sources have sufficient luminosity to be ionizing sources , pointing to the influence of cyg  ob2 creating external ionization .",
    "the complex morphology along with the direction of cometary shapes of some compact sources provide direct evidence of interaction with the massive cyg  ob2 association . along the periphery of the evacuated  region created by some of the more evolved stellar clusters ,",
    "there is a signature of triggered star formation .",
    "we have observed a complex of infrared quiet dark clouds where star formation has already started to take place .",
    "to blast , and also _ scuba _  and mambo , this appears as an impressive ridge of cold dust emission .",
    "however , in sensitive high resolution 24  mips  and 8  _ irac _  images , there is evidence of a stellar nursery , indicating a potential site of massive star formation . in our search for the precursors of clusters , however , we have not found any cold compact clump which is massive enough to become a star cluster like the cyg  ob2 association or even the other lesser embedded clusters . in the future ,",
    "the unbiased planck cold core survey might find such objects in unevolved gmcs , possibly in a more extended lower surface density state than in the final cluster .",
    "resolving multi - scale structures is a new challenge underlying investigations of the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "blast with its limited resolution could only resolve spatial structures of 0.5  pc at 1.7  kpc away . on the other hand ,",
    "mambo  with its 11  resolution was successful in separating sub - structures on a scale of 0.1 pc ; further progress should be possible with _ herschel_. to determine the role of surface density and more generally which cold high mass clumps will evolve to produce high mass protostars even higher resolution observations will be required , and so there appears to be a rich future in uncovering the unseen story using scuba2 ( 8  resolution at 450  , @xcite ) , ccat ( 3.5  at 350  , @xcite ) , and alma ( down to sub - arcsecond resolution at submillimeter wavelengths the blast collaboration acknowledges the support of nasa through grant numbers nag5 - 12785 , nag5 - 13301 , and nngo-6gi11 g , the canadian space agency ( csa ) , the uk particle physics & astronomy research council ( pparc ) , and canada s natural sciences and engineering research council ( nserc ) .",

    "<S> we present cygnus x in a new multi - wavelength perspective based on an unbiased blast survey at 250 , 350 , and 500  , combined with rich datasets for this well - studied region . </S>",
    "<S> our primary goal is to investigate the early stages of high mass star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected 184  compact sources in various stages of evolution across all three blast bands . from their well - constrained spectral energy distributions , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the physical properties mass , surface density , bolometric luminosity , and dust temperature . </S>",
    "<S> some of the bright sources reaching 40  k contain well - known compact  regions . </S>",
    "<S> we relate these to other sources at earlier stages of evolution via the energetics as deduced from their position in the luminosity - mass ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) diagram . the blast spectral coverage , near the peak of the spectral energy distribution of the dust , reveals fainter sources too cool ( @xmath2  k ) to be seen by earlier shorter - wavelength surveys like _ </S>",
    "<S> iras_. we detect thermal emission from infrared dark clouds and investigate the phenomenon of cold `` starless cores '' more generally . </S>",
    "<S> _ spitzer _ images of these cold sources often show stellar nurseries , but these potential sites for massive star formation are `` starless '' in the sense that to date there is no massive protostar in a vigorous accretion phase . we discuss evolution in the context of the @xmath0-@xmath1  diagram . </S>",
    "<S> theory raises some interesting possibilities : some cold massive compact sources might never form a cluster containing massive stars ; and clusters with massive stars might not have an identifiable compact cold massive precursor . </S>"
