    "in the year of @xmath2 wigner and huntington predicted that under the influence of high pressure ( @xmath3 ) the molecular phase of solid hydrogen passes into a metallic phase @xcite .",
    "recently , the theoretical calculations fixed the metallization pressure for the solid hydrogen at @xmath4 gpa @xcite . in the case of the liquid hydrogen , nellis _ et al . _ inform about the observation of the insulator - metal transition for pressure of @xmath5 gpa and the temperature @xmath6 k @xcite .",
    "this result confirms the fact that the liquid hydrogen in the metallic state exists inside jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "we notice that the hydrogen phase diagram from the planetary science aspect is in detail discussed by fortney and hubbard in @xcite . in the year of 1968",
    "ashcroft suggested the possibility of occurrence of additional phase transition in the solid hydrogen ; from the metallic to the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "the obtained results concerning superconductivity in the solid metallic hydrogen can shed light on the internal structure of the hypothetical cold giant planets .",
    "we define the _ cold _ planets as a class of planets whose mass is close to the mass of saturn or exceeds it . additionally , they have the characteristics : ( i ) the _ cold _ planets are primarily composed of the hydrogen .",
    "( ii ) some part of the solid metallic hydrogen is in the superconducting state .    the liquid metallic hydrogen inside the planet like saturn exists between 200 gpa and 1000 gpa @xcite .",
    "so , only the low - pressure superconducting state one can consider in the solid hydrogen for low values of the temperature . in the model calculations the best choice represents the planet that possessess the jupiter s mass , where the liquid metallic hydrogen is induced between 200 gpa and 4000 gpa @xcite .",
    "in the paper we will calculate the maximum surface temperature of the _ cold _ jupiter .",
    "we will consider the high- and low - pressure superconducting state inside the planet ( @xmath7 gpa or @xmath8 gpa ) .",
    "we notice that these states are characterized by the maximum values of the critical temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "additionally , we will show that _ cold _ planet represents the final state of the thermal evolution of free - floating giant planet .",
    "the superconducting properties of the metallic hydrogen for @xmath7 gpa are determined by the eliashberg equations @xcite : @xmath10 }   { \\sqrt{\\omega_m^2+\\delta_m^2 } } \\delta_{m},\\ ] ] @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the superconducting order parameter and the wave function renormalization factor respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath14 denotes the matsubara frequencies ; @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the functions @xmath17 are defined by the formula : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the pairing kernel : @xmath20 the eliashberg function ( @xmath21 ) for @xmath7 gpa was determined in @xcite ; the maximum phonon frequency ( @xmath22 ) is equal to @xmath23 mev .",
    "the influence of in - between electron coulomb interaction on the superconducting state is modeled by the function : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "the symbol @xmath26 denotes the heaviside unit function and @xmath27 is the phonon cut - off frequency ( @xmath28 ) .    by using the eliashberg equations we have shown in the paper @xcite that the dependency of the critical temperature on the coulomb pseudopotential can be precisely parameterized by the _ modified _",
    "allen - dynes formula @xcite : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where the electron - phonon coupling constant ( @xmath30 ) and the logarithmic phonon frequency ( @xmath31 ) are defined by : @xmath32 @xmath33.\\ ] ] in the considered case @xmath34 and @xmath35 mev .",
    "the functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 have the form @xcite : @xmath38^{\\frac{1}{3 } } , \\qquad f_{2}\\equiv 1+\\frac { \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega_{2}}}{\\omega_{\\rm{ln}}}-1\\right)\\lambda^{2 } } { \\lambda^{2}+\\lambda^{2}_{2}},\\ ] ] where : @xmath39 and @xmath40 ev . finally : @xmath41 the value of @xmath9 can be easily calculated on the basis of the formula [ r4 ] .",
    "in particular , for @xmath42 the critical temperature changes the value from @xmath43 k to @xmath44 k.",
    "below , we calculate the maximum surface temperature of the _ cold _ jupiter @xmath45_{\\rm{max}}$ ] ( the temperature at the pressure @xmath46=100 kpa ) . in the first step , we determine the relationship between the surface temperature and the internal temperature @xmath47 ( the temperature at the pressure @xmath48 ) . by using the adiabatic model we obtain @xcite : @xmath49 where the adiabatic index @xmath50 equals the jupiter s index ; @xmath51 .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 has been calculated under the assumption that the surface temperature of the jupiter equals @xmath52 k and @xmath53 k for @xmath54 gpa @xcite .    next , for the high - pressure superconducting state we take : @xmath55 gpa and @xmath56 . to describe the low - pressure case we use : @xmath57 gpa and @xmath58 k @xcite .",
    "we notice that this state is characterized by the maximum value of @xmath9 and its properties are obtained in the framework of the recently introduced density functional theory of superconductivity .",
    "the dependence of the internal temperature on the surface temperature is shown in the figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to the values of the critical temperature . on the basis of the presented results ,",
    "we conclude that the maximum surface temperature of the _ cold _ jupiter is situated between 4 k and 6.2 k.    .",
    "the horizontal lines denote the values of the critical temperature . ]",
    "the superconducting state inside the jupiter can not exist because the value of the jupiter s surface temperature is too high .",
    "this fact is connected with jupiter s young age ( @xmath59 gyr ) @xcite . in the last step ,",
    "we calculate the surface temperature of the old free - floating giant planet .",
    "we assume that the planet s age is equal to @xmath60 gyr ( the age of the oldest known planet ) @xcite and the maximum temperature rises during the formation to @xmath61 k @xcite .    the evolutionary model of the giant planet was first presented by hubbard @xcite .",
    "the thermal history calculations for non - rotating planet of the jupiter s radius @xmath62 and the jupiter s mass @xmath63 can be done by using the equation : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath66 is the planet s effective temperature , @xmath67 is the planet s luminosity and @xmath68 is the planet s age .",
    "the symbol @xmath69 denotes the specified composition of the various mass fractions .",
    "in particular , we assume that the planet has the core of the mass @xmath70 and its thermal evolution is independent of the separation of the helium from the metallic hydrogen",
    ".    the figure [ f2 ] shows our result .",
    "we see that in the universe the _ cold _ jupiter can not yet exist because the surface temperature for @xmath71 gyr is too high ( @xmath72 k ) .",
    "we obtain that the superconducting state will be induced inside the planet for @xmath73 gyr .",
    "so , the _ cold _ planet represents the final state of the thermal evolution of the free - floating giant planet .",
    "we have calculated the maximum surface temperature of the _ cold _ jupiter whose internal structure is close to structure of jupiter .",
    "we have shown that @xmath45_{\\rm{max}}$ ] is situated between @xmath74 k and @xmath75 k. we have proved that the _ cold _ planet represents the final state of the thermal evolution of the free - floating giant planet .",
