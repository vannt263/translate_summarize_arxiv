    "most of the work comparing lithium depletion to hr diagram ages has been done in open clusters , focusing on comparing the cluster age derived from the lithium depletion boundary ( ldb ) ) , at a given age there is a sharp boundary between stars that have fully depleted their lithium and slightly less massive stars with no evidence of depletion @xcite . ] in the lowest - mass stars with the hr diagram age found from fitting the upper main sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these older upper - main sequence fitting ages tend to be in better agreement with ldb ages @xcite .",
    "a few studies have been done of individual stars , showing that ages derived from comparison of lithium abundances with models of lithium depletion are persistently older than ages derived from the hr diagram .",

    "we want the stars to be of intermediate age , @xmath7@xmath8 myr ; much younger , and very little lithium depletion has occurred ; much older , and they are on the main sequence , where the hr diagram age is degenerate .",

    "we visually examined the flux calibrated spectra to ensure that the calibration was consistent between orders and between the two calibration standards .      to determine spectral types for our sample , we compared the strength of the tio5 band to the strength of the nearby continuum following the method given in @xcite .",

    "additionally , since the relation gives a numeric value for the spectral type , with 0 representing m0 , it is not clear how to assign that number to the morgan - keenan system for values @xmath21 since some authors argue that k6 is not a distinct spectral type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we follow the convention of omitting k6 as a spectral type and assign @xmath22 to k7 and @xmath23 to k5 .",
    "thus , we give the spectral types of hip 29964 and bd @xmath196128 a as k5.4 and k5.7 , respectively , corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 as measured from the relation given in @xcite . @xcite give the spectral types of these stars as k6/7 and k7/m0 , respectively , and @xcite find k4 and k6 .",

    "we estimate the uncertainty of the hr diagram age by perturbing the effective temperatures and luminosities within their uncertainties and adding the resulting age errors in quadrature .",

    "the trend of increasing age with spectral type found using the @xcite and @xcite lithium depletion isochrones simply reflects the fact that the data cross the isochrones instead of lying parallel to them , as seen in figure [ fig : evolmod ] .",
    "although the @xcite models are the closest to predicting a coeval group using lithium depletion , they still fail to accurately represent the latest - type stars in the sample .",

    "we observe two systematic trends in the data .",
    "first , the ages of the mid - m dwarfs calculated from the hr diagram isochrones are slightly younger than the ages of the warmer stars .",
    "this effect has also been noted by @xcite in the ages of binary components , and has been recognized more generally as a problem for pms evolutionary models by @xcite .",
    "the second trend is that the ages of the mid - m stars calculated from their lithium depletion are older than the ages of the warmer stars .",
    "while the hr diagram isochrones match our data well and the stars are roughly coeval , none of the evolutionary models have lithium depletion isochrones consistent with a coeval group .",
    "if we consider each multiple star system independently of the group as a whole , we find similar inconsistencies in the predicted ages for the hotter and cooler stars in each binary .",
    "since the two stars in each binary are almost certain to be coeval within @xmath109 myr , coeval clusters to within @xmath110 myr , although there are hints of smaller age differences @xcite . ]",
    ", this indicates that the mismatch between our data and the isochrones is not the result of contamination by unrelated stars or an extended period of star formation . in general",
    ", the models seem to have difficulty describing the lithium depletion of the lowest - mass stars . in particular , the modeled rise in lithium abundance at lower temperatures ( the ldb ) occurs at temperatures too high for our stars in all of the evolutionary models .",

    "the discrepancy between the true radii and the radii predicted by models very likely exists in the pre  main - sequence phase as well , if it is due to effects of magnetic activity and/or missing opacity sources in the models .",
    "if this discrepancy is present , how would it manifest itself ? here",
    "we argue that the effect would be similar to what we observe , and correcting for this would bring hr diagram ages and li depletion ages closer together .",
    "corrected model isochrones for a given age would need to move to lower @xmath161 , increasing the age inferred from the hr diagram and decreasing the age inferred from li depletion for a given star .",
    "first consider the hr diagram .",
    "main - sequence stars change position in the hr diagram as they age precisely because their radii are changing , as the stars descend ( contract ) toward the main sequence .",
    "if , at any given age , the true radii of stars are larger , then the model isochrones for that age need to move up and to the right .",
    "thus , the hr diagram age of a given star ( of fixed , observed  and ) inferred from these corrected models would be older than before . put another way , if radii are inflated by effects other than youth , it will take longer for a star to contract to a given radius , and thus to reach a given position on the hr diagram .",
    "now , consider the @xmath162(li)  plane .",
    "the amount of li depletion at a given age is primarily driven by a star s mass , which sets its interior conditions . inflating the radius of a star will cause that star to have a cooler surface , i.e.  a lower .",
    "thus , corrected model isochrones would need to shift to the right for a given @xmath162(li ) and age .",
    "put another way , a star with an inflated radius will have a hotter interior than we might otherwise expect given its surface appearance , and thus will exhibit more li depletion at a given age and  than would be predicted if the radius were not modified .",
    "this matches well with the enhanced li depletion we observe for the cooler stars .    calculating new pre ",
    "main - sequence evolutionary models incorporating these effects is beyond the scope of this work , but we can explore these effects to a limited degree by introducing an _ ad hoc _ shift to the existing model isochrones . as a test of this idea , we shifted the model isochrones of @xcite and compared them to our observations of a(li ) and  for the bpmg stars .",
    "based on the observations of m stars discussed above , we assumed that the larger radii are present only for stars cooler than @xmath1 4200 k @xcite , and that the model radii should be inflated by 10% .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : bcah ] , these corrections to the models do indeed bring the inferred li depletion and hr diagram ages of the cooler stars into better agreement , though some discrepancies remain . clearly , a more systematic treatment of this effect is needed , perhaps taking into account effects of different activity levels as well as different masses .",
    "to close , we note that one implication of this result is that neither the ldb ages nor the hr diagram ages of m stars are correct , but that the answer lies somewhere between the two .",
    "we have measured lithium abundances and effective temperatures for ten members of the @xmath0 pictoris moving group .",
    "we compare these abundances to the predictions of the evolutionary models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we find that while the hr diagram isochrones of these models reproduce our data fairly well , the lithium depletion isochrones do not .",
    "in particular , the models predict less lithium depletion for the latest - type stars than we observe .",
    "thus , the ages determined based on the lithium abundances are older than the ages determined from the hr diagram .",
    "the most striking result is the non - detection of lithium in the latest - type members ( m3.5m5 ) of this group .",
    "the lack of an observable lithium line in hd 155555 c , gj 799 n , and gj 799 s indicates that lithium depletion proceeds at a much faster rate than is predicted in the theoretical models given their spectral types .",
    "one potential clue lies in the discrepancy between the observed radii of m dwarfs and the radii predicted by models .",
    "regardless of the physical mechanism , it appears that mid - m stars deplete their lithium rapidly .",
    "the presence of the lithium line at 6707.8 in a star of this type remains a clear indicator of youth and suggests an age younger than that of the @xmath0 pictoris moving group , while the lack of a detectable line is _ not _ a strong indicator that a star is old .                                    , l.  a. , bauermeister , a. , & white , r.  j. 2008 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
