    "the hubbard model may be mapped onto a spin - only problem whose spins are those of the electrons that singly occupy sites .",
    "however , for intermediate @xmath14 values this mapping generates many complicated terms in the hamiltonian , when written in terms of electron creation and annihilation operators .",
    "here we address that problem by expressing the hamiltonian in terms of the rotated - electron operators , which naturally emerge from the generators of the model s symmetries .",
    "in contrast to electrons , for rotated electrons single and double occupancy are good quantum numbers for @xmath33 . for large @xmath14 values electrons and rotated electrons",
    "are the same objects .",
    "apparently , the hamiltonian @xmath34 expansion is formally similar in terms of electron and rotated - electron operators .",
    "however that is only so for very large @xmath14 values . for instance , there are well - defined @xmath35 and @xmath36 terms in the hamiltonian expression in terms of rotated - electron operators , which are identical in form for very large @xmath14 to the corresponding terms using electron operators .",
    "however , for intermediate @xmath17 , if one expresses the former @xmath35 and @xmath36 terms in electron creation and annihilation operators , one finds many complicated higher order @xmath37 terms where for the half - filled case @xmath38 are even integers , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "hence the first few terms of the hamiltonian expression in terms of rotated - electron operators describe many higher - order electron processes . for moderate @xmath14",
    "the rotated - electron operators also generate a much simpler form for the energy eigenstates as well as for complicated processes involving a large number of electrons .",
    "our spin-@xmath4 spinons correspond to the spin-@xmath4 spins of the rotated electrons that singly occupy sites , so that they are well defined for @xmath33 . when one decreases @xmath14 to the intermediate @xmath14 values suitable for lco , the above mentioned hamiltonian terms become increasingly important and generate higher - order spinon processes .",
    "fortunately , those are simpler than the corresponding electron processes .",
    "indeed , the use of our operational representation renders the intermediate @xmath14 quantum problem in terms of rotated electrons similar to the corresponding large-@xmath14 quantum problem in terms of electrons .",
    "the effect of decreasing @xmath14 is mostly an increase of the energy bandwidth of an effective band associated with the spinon occupancy configurations .",

    "emerge naturally upon decreasing the magnitude of @xmath14 .",
    "our theoretical studies provide evidence of the occurrence of ground - state @xmath9-wave spinon pairing in the half - filled hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "one of the few exact theorems that applies to the half - filled hubbard model on a bipartite lattice with a finite number of sites and thus on a square lattice is that its ground state is a spin - singlet state @xcite . within our spinon representation",
