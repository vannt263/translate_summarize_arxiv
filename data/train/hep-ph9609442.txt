    "<S> but it has been realized a decade ago that , unless the universe started with a non - vanishing @xmath1 asymmetry , any @xmath2 or @xmath3 asymmetry generated at the gut scale would be erased by sphaleron transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an initial @xmath1 asymmetry can be obtained in theories containing an extra gauge @xmath4 symmetry via the out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism however requires either very heavy neutrinos or extreme fine tuning of the parameters in the neutrinos mass matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the masses of the new gauge bosons must be bigger than the smallest heavy neutrino mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is a wide range of parameters for which the mechanism does not produce enough baryon asymmetry .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we show that in unified models involving an extra gauge @xmath4 symmetry , a primordial @xmath1 asymmetry can be generated by the out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos released by collapsing cosmic string loops . as a consequence of @xmath4 breaking </S>",

    "<S> we call them @xmath1 cosmic strings . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs field mediating the breaking of @xmath1 is the higgs field forming the strings and it is the same higgs field that gives heavy majorana mass to the right - handed neutrinos . </S>",

    "<S> unified theories with rank greater than five , such as so(10 ) or e(6 ) , @xmath1 cosmic strings may form , depending on the symmetry breaking pattern and on the set of higgs fields used to do the breaking down to the standard model gauge group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a wide range of theories which contain both @xmath4 and @xmath1 cosmic strings .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a unified model with an extra @xmath4 gauge symmetry and stable @xmath1 cosmic strings </S>",
    "<S> . the gauge and higgs fields forming the strings will be the @xmath1 associated gauge boson @xmath14 and the higgs field @xmath15 used to break @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> right - handed neutrinos acquire heavy majorana mass via yukawa couplings to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 part of the theory is described by the lagrangian @xmath17 the covariant derivative @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gauge coupling constant and @xmath12 is a linear combination of @xmath1 and @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> ; it must be an integer . </S>",
    "<S> most strings have winding number @xmath32 ; strings with winding number @xmath33 are unstable . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 is the string s generator ; it is the normalised @xmath35 generator . </S>",
    "<S> it has different eigenvalues for different fermion fields . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 must satisfy the following boundary conditions @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the scale of @xmath1 breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the exact forms of the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend on the higgs potential @xmath21 .    from the lagrangian ( [ eq : laglept ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we derive the equation for the right - handed neutrino field : @xmath40 where @xmath41 . solving ( [ eq : mot1 ] ) , we find that majorana neutrinos trapped as tranverse zero modes in the core of @xmath1 cosmic strings have only one independent component . for an @xmath32 vortex it takes the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a function peaked at @xmath44 which exponentially vanishes outside the core of the string , so that the fermions effectively live on the strings . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 and @xmath45 dependence of @xmath46 shows that the neutrinos travel at the speed of light in the @xmath47 direction , so that they are effectively massless . in an @xmath48 vortex , the function @xmath49 , so that the fermions travel at the speed of light in the @xmath50 direction . </S>",
    "<S> these fermions can be described by an effective theory in @xmath51 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the usual energy to momentum relation @xmath52 holds . </S>",
    "<S> we have no boundary conditions in the 1 spatial dimension , and the spectrum of states is continuous . in the ground state </S>",
    "<S> the fermi momentum of the zero modes is @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the field solution ( [ eq : nur ] ) and the energy to momentum relation ( [ eq : e ] ) have been derived for fermions on a straight infinite string . </S>",
    "<S> however physical cosmic strings are very wiggly and are not straight . hence relations ( [ eq : nur ] ) and ( [ eq : e ] ) do not hold in the physical case . </S>",
    "<S> neither do they hold for cosmic string loops , even if the latter are assumed to be smooth . on a cosmic string loop </S>",
    "<S> , fermions are characterised by their angular momentum @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy relation becomes @xcite @xmath54 and hence the energy spectrum is @xmath55 where @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we see from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : e ] ) , ( [ eq : e2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : e1 ] ) that , when @xmath57 is very large , the string looks locally like a straight string . </S>",
    "<S> we have an almost continuous spectrum of states . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the string gets a finite curvature acts as a perturbation on the string bound states . </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels get quantised and the fermi energy gets a non - vanishing value , @xmath58 . as the string loop shrinks , its radius @xmath57 decreases and we see from eq.([eq : e1 ] ) that the fermi energy increases and that the separation between energy levels gets wider .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming that a loop decays when its radius @xmath57 becomes comparable to its width @xmath59 , we deduce that the fermi energy level when the loop decays is @xmath60 , where the @xmath1 breaking scale @xmath39 is of the order of the right - handed neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is lower than the energy needed by the neutrinos to escape the string @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , when a cosmic loop decays , it releases at least @xmath62 heavy majorana neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> quantum fluctuations and finite temperature corrections may increase @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> part of the final burst of energy released by the decaying cosmic string loop is converted into mass energy for the gauge and higgs particles released by the string , and into mass energy for the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> a decaying @xmath1 cosmic string loop releases heavy @xmath1 higgs particles which can decay into right - handed neutrino pairs , and hence increase @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an out - of - equilibrium process . due to angular momentum conservation , the massive majorana neutrinos released by a decaying cosmic string loop which were trapped as transverse zero modes are spinning particles .    heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos interact with the standard model leptons via the yukawa couplings @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the usual lepton doublet ; for the first family @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 is the standard model doublet of higgs fields . </S>",
    "<S> majorana right - handed neutrinos can decay via the diagrams shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1.a . and 1.b </S>",
    "<S> cp is violated through the one loop radiative correction involving a higgs particle as shown in figure 1.b . </S>",
    "<S> the right - handed neutrinos are out - of - equilibrium , and hence a lepton asymmetry can be generated . </S>",
    "<S> the lepton asymmetry is characterised by the cp violation parameter @xmath68 which , assuming that the neutrino dirac masses fall into a hierarchical pattern qualitatively similar to that of the leptons and quarks , is estimated to be @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dirac mass of the third lepton generation , @xmath71 is the vacuum expectation value of the electroweak higgs field @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the right - handed neutrino majorana masses of the first and second generation respectively and @xmath75 is the cp violating phase .    the corresponding @xmath1 asymmetry ( we use @xmath1 instead of @xmath3 since the ( @xmath76)-violating electroweak anomaly conserves @xmath1 ) must be calculated solving boltzmann equations which take into account all @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath76 violating interactions and their inverse decay rates . we can however calculate the @xmath1 asymmetry produced taking into account only the out - of - equilibrium decays of right - handed neutrinos released by decaying cosmic string loops and assuming that the rates of inverse decays are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> hence an upper limit on the baryon number per commoving volume at temperature @xmath77 is then given by @xcite @xmath78 where s is the entropy at time @xmath45 and @xmath79 is the number density of right - handed neutrinos which have been released by decaying cosmic string loops at time @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> recall that the temperature @xmath77 is related to the cosmic time @xmath45 via the relation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 counts the number of massless degrees of freedom in the corresponding phase and @xmath82 is the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 , the entropy at time @xmath45 , is given by @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 is approximately @xmath63 times the number density of cosmic string loops which have shrinked to a point at temperature @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that sphaleron transitions are not in thermal equilibrium below @xmath85 , and neglecting any baryon number violating processes which might have occured below @xmath85 , the baryon number of the universe at temperature @xmath86 is then given by @xmath87 which is also the baryon number of the universe today . </S>",
    "<S> if sphaleron transitions are also rapid below @xmath85 , we should include the neutrinos released below @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> however , below @xmath85 the number density of decaying cosmic string loops is negligible , and hence this would not affect the result in any sense .    </S>",
    "<S> the number density of decaying cosmic string loops can be estimated from the three scales model of reference@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on the assumption that the cosmic string network evolution is characterised by three length scales @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 related to the long string density , the persistence length along the long strings ( which is related to the fact that the typical loop size is much smaller than @xmath91 ) , and the small scale structure along the strings respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmic string loops lose their energy by emitting gravitational radiation at a rate @xmath92 @xcite , where @xmath93 is the string mass - per - unit - length and @xmath94 is the critical temperature of the phase transition leading to the string network formation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is newton s constant . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical factor @xmath95 depends on the loop s shape and trajectory , but is independent of its length . the mean size of a loop born at @xmath96 is assumed to be @xmath97 . at a later time @xmath45 , it is then @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the loop finally disappears at a time @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , k is found to lie between 2 and 10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the rate at which the string loops form in a volume @xmath100 is given by @xcite @xmath101 where the parameter @xmath102 can be expressed in terms of the various length scales of the model which vary with time . </S>",
    "<S> we start with @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath104 and later @xmath105 will start to grow and will evolve to the scaling regime characterised by @xmath88 and @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the length scale @xmath107 grows much less rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath108 varies with time . in the scaling regime , @xmath102 is estimated to lie in the range @xmath109 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note that it has recently been shown that cosmic string networks reach the scaling solution at a time @xmath110 much smaller than previously estimated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref.@xcite find that in the radiation dominated , for minimal gut strings , @xmath111 @xcite , where @xmath112 is the time at which the strings form , and the associated temperature is @xmath113 gev . </S>",
    "<S> hence our approximation for the rate of cosmic string loop formation is suitable ; it leads to a lower bound on the number of cosmic string loops . only numerical simulations could lead us to a better estimate , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .    since it has been shown that most of the loops formed have relatively small size </S>",
    "<S> , we shall assume that the number of loops rejoining the network is negligible and thus that the number of decaying loops is equal to the number of forming loops . </S>",
    "<S> hence the number density of right - handed neutrinos which have been released by decaying cosmic string loops at time @xmath45 is given by @xmath114 where where @xmath115 is the cosmic scale factor and @xmath63 is the mean number of right - handed neutrinos released by a single decaying loop . </S>",
    "<S> in the radiation dominated era @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> after integration we obtain @xmath117 t^3 .\\ ] ] hence the baryon number per commoving volume today produced by the decays of heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos released by decaying cosmic string loops given in eq.([eq : b - l ] ) becomes @xmath118 where we have used eq.([eq : cp ] ) for the cp violation parameter @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the produced @xmath2 asymmetry depends on the cosmic string scenario parameters , on the neutrino mass matrix and on the strength of cp violation .    </S>",
    "<S> we now calculate the lower and upper bounds on @xmath2 which correspond to different values of the parameters in the cosmic string scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the neutrino mass matrix parameters and assume maximum cp violation , i.e. @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the dirac mass of the third generation fermions lies in the range @xmath120 gev , and that the ratio of the right - handed neutrino masses of the first and second generation @xmath121 . with the above assumptions , we find @xmath2 to lie in the range @xmath122 and we see that @xmath2 strongly depends on the cosmic string scenario parameters . recall that the baryon number - to - photon ratio @xmath123 is related to the baryon number of the universe @xmath2 by @xmath124 . hence , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath125 , our mechanism alone can explain the baryon - number - to - photon ratio predicted by nucleosynthesis , @xmath126 , with the @xmath1 breaking scale in the range @xmath127 we point out that the result could be better calculated solving boltzmann equations , which take into account all @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath76 violating interactions and do not neglect the inverse decay rates . furthermore , the rate of decaying cosmic string loops can be calculated via numerical simulations , which would have to take into account the different regimes of the network evolution which occur during and after the friction dominated era . </S>",
    "<S> this may change the allowed value for the @xmath1 breaking scale by a few orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> note also that if cp is not maximally violated , the @xmath1 breaking scale will be shifted towards higher values . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we recall that when a cosmic string loop decays , it also releases massive higgs bosons @xmath15 and massive gauge bosons @xmath28 which can decay into right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> this process is not taken into account here because the masses of the higgs and gauge bosons and of the neutrinos are very close to each other and the higgs and gauge fields can also decay into other particles . </S>"
