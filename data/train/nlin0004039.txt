    "a conspicuous phenomenological discriminant between quantized integrable and nonintegrable parametric hamiltonian systems with two or more degrees of freedom is the occurrence or prohibition of level crossings between states within the same invariant hilbert subspace of the underlying symmetry group.@xcite consider a quantum system with @xmath2 continuous parameters whose classical counterpart is integrable on a manifold of dimensionality @xmath3 in parameter space .",
    "empirical evidence suggests that level crossings occur on @xmath4-dimensional manifolds which are embedded in the integrability manifold . a recent study,@xcite which investigated this issue systematically , showed for a two - spin model with @xmath5 and @xmath6 that the level crossing manifolds are , in fact , four - dimensional and that they are all confined to the five - dimensional integrability manifold .",
    "it showed , moreover , that the ( classical ) integrability manifold can be reconstructed from the ( intrinsically quantum mechanical ) level crossing manifolds .",
    "the focus of the present study is to illuminate the natural cause underlying this characteristic relationship between level crossing manifolds and integrability manifolds .",
    "we attribute this relationship to the presence of action operators as constituent elements of the hamiltonian operator for integrable quantum systems .",
    "the textbook solution of an integrable classical dynamical system with two degrees of freedom , specified by an analytic function @xmath7 of canonical coordinates , is to transform the hamiltonian into a function of two action coordinates : @xmath8 .",
    "the canonical transformation @xmath9 to action - angle coordinates amounts to a solution of the dynamical problem because it transforms hamilton s equations of motion , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , generically a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations , into @xmath12 , @xmath13 with the solutions @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "deriving the expressions @xmath19 and @xmath20 from @xmath17 and @xmath21 requires the use of separable canonical coordinates .",
    "finding separable coordinates can be a difficult task even if the second invariant is known .    the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 establish a pivotal link between an integrable classical system and a quantized version of it .",
    "semiclassical quantization derives its raison dtre from the obvious fact that quantizing a functional relation is much less problematic if it involves only quantities such as @xmath22 whose quantum counterparts are guaranteed to be commuting operators .",
    "in the context of this study , it is useful to distinguish and compare three versions of the same model system : ( i ) the _ quantum _ version , ( ii ) the _ classical _ version , and ( iii ) the ( semiclassically ) _ quantized _ version .    the primary version is the quantum model , specified by the hamiltonian expressed as an operator valued function of a set of dynamical variables ( position , momentum , spin , @xmath23 ) the commutation relations of these operators and the metric of the associated hilbert space along with the rules of quantum mechanics then determine , via the heisenberg equation of motion , the time evolution of any observable quantity of interest .",
    "the classical limit converts the hamiltonian operator into the classical energy function , the commutator algebra of dynamical variables into the symplectic structure ( the fundamental poisson brackets ) , and the heisenberg equation of motion for any operator into the hamilton equation of motion for the corresponding classical quantity .",
    "these quantities , in turn , enable us to express the energy function as a classical hamiltonian , i.e. as a function of canonical coordinates .",
    "the quantization of a classical hamiltonian system requires a prescription for translating the functional relations between classical dynamical variables into functional relations between corresponding operators .",
    "semiclassical quantization is one neat and clean procedure applicable to all integrable classical systems .",
    "it borrows from classical mechanics the functional dependence , @xmath24 , of the hamiltonian on the action operators and postulates that the eigenvalue spectrum of the latter consists of equidistant levels spaced by @xmath25 : @xmath26 with integer @xmath27 .",
