    "due to its particular electronic band structure , the atom - thick form of carbon known as graphene exhibits unique electronic and optical properties that have attracted tremendous attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "several applications from terahertz ( thz ) to visible frequencies , including solar cells , touch screens , photodetectors , light - emitting devices and ultrafast lasers , are clear evidence of the rise of graphene in photonics and optoelectronics @xcite . the strength of the mutual interaction between graphene and electromagnetic radiation plays a key role in a great majority of these applications . however , a single sheet of homogeneous graphene exhibits an optical absorbance of @xmath0% @xcite , a value strong enough to detect exfoliated monolayers by visual inspection under an optical microscope but not sufficiently strong as could be desirable in many photonics and optoelectronics applications .",
    "the interaction between graphene and electromagnetic radiation can be improved in the presence of surface plasmons , whether by combining a graphene layer with conventional plasmonic nanostructures based on noble metals @xcite or by taking advantage of the long - lived , electrically tunable surface plasmons supported by graphene @xcite .",
    "the first alternative fits well in the visible and near - infrared frequencies where the interband loss becomes large and graphene behaves as a dielectric material , whereas the second alternative fits well in the terahertz and infrared regions where doped graphene nanostructures can support surface plasmons @xcite .",
    "surface plasmons can be roughly divided into two categories : surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) propagating along waveguiding structures and localized surface plasmons ( lsps ) supported by spatially limited structures , such as scattering particles .",
    "since the spatial periodicity associated with a surface plasmon propagating along a graphene monolayer is always less than the spatial periodicity which could be induced by an incident plane wave , plane waves can not resonantly excite propagating surface plasmons at a flat graphene monolayer .",
    "in contrast , in bounded geometries , localized surface plasmons ( lsps ) can be resonantly excited by plane waves at discrete frequencies that depend on the size and shape of the object to which they are confined .",
    "the plasmonic properties of graphene wrapped particles have recently attracted the attention of researchers @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions are only available for particles with a very simple shape , such as spheres @xcite or circular cylinders @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the application of mie theory leads to multipole coefficients for the scattered field which have essentially the same form as those corresponding to the bare particles , except for additive corrections proportional to the graphene surface conductivity in the numerator and denominator .",
    "taking into account the significant progress made in the fabrication of particles with a variety of shapes and dimensions @xcite and that wrapping up particles with graphene coatings brings extra freedom for scattering engineering and for improving the interaction between graphene and electromagnetic radiation via surface plasmon mechanisms , the investigation of the scattering characteristics of graphene  coated particles seems a particularly interesting and very promising area to explore . in the particular case of dielectric , almost transparent particles ,",
    "graphene coatings introduce tunable plasmons which are absent in the bare particle , whereas for metallic or metallic - like particles , graphene coatings can modify in a controlled manner the lsps already existing in the bare particle .",
    "the particular relation between the shape of a graphene particle and its plasmonic characteristics such as cross - section enhancement , interplay between near- and far  field quantities , plasmon resonance frequencies and linewidths can be exploited in many thz applications , including the sensing of small changes in a host - medium refractive index caused by the change in concentration of an analyzed substance @xcite or the design of sub  wavelength metamaterials @xcite . in order to realize graphene",
    " wrapped plasmonic particles with tailored properties for specific applications , complete electromagnetic solutions are needed . the purpose of this paper is to present a rigorous , fully retarded method based on green s second identity @xcite for modeling the scattering characteristics of graphene  coated , homogeneous dielectric or metallic two dimensional particles ( wires ) of rather arbitrary shape .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : green ] we give exact expressions for the electromagnetic field scattered by a graphene  coated wire illuminated perpendicular to its axis by a p or s  polarized monochromatic plane wave .",
    "the scattered field is expressed in terms of two unknown source functions evaluated on the wire surface , one related to the total field in the medium of incidence and the other related to its normal derivative . to find both surface source functions , a coupled pair of inhomogeneous integral equations",
    "must be solved numerically . in section [ sec : results ] the numerical technique is illustrated and validated for wires of circular and elliptical section . as a first validation we consider metallic and dielectric circular wires and show that in this case the numerical results agree perfectly well with those obtained analytically using mie s theory @xcite . to explore the effects that the departure from circular geometries has on the scattering and extinction cross - sections",
    "we then consider graphene ",
    "coated wires of elliptical section .",
    "we present scattering and absorption efficiency spectra showing that , similarly to the plasmonic resonances of bare metallic wires , the break of the rotational symmetry of the wire section introduces a two - dimensional anisotropy in the angular optical response of the wire , particularly evident in a frequency splitting of the strong dipolar plasmonic resonance @xcite , but also observable for higher multipolar resonances . using the green formulation , we show near - field distributions which reveal that the splittings correspond to strong localization of the near field at specific positions along the ellipse axes .",
    "besides , and as a further test on the validity of the green formulation , we show that the multipolar order inferred for ellipses with low eccentricities from the topology of the near  field distribution for a given resonant frequency is in excellent agreement with the multipolar order inferred from the spectral proximity between the enhancement peaks in the scattering efficiency spectra of an elliptical and a similar circular wire .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : final ] we summarize and discuss the results obtained .",
    "the gaussian system of units is used and an @xmath1 time ",
    "dependence is implicit throughout the paper , with @xmath2 the angular frequency , @xmath3 the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath4 the time , and @xmath5 .",

    ". the parameter @xmath9 can represent the arc length along the curve or any other convenient parameter , such as the angle @xmath10 .",

    "this wire is coated with a graphene monolayer which can be considered as an infinitesimally thin , local and isotropic two - sided layer with frequency  dependent surface conductivity @xmath15 given by the kubo formula @xcite , with the intraband contribution @xmath16 given by @xmath17 } , \\label{sigma1}\\ ] ] and the interband contribution @xmath18 given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the chemical potential ( controlled with the help of a gate voltage ) , @xmath21 the carriers scattering rate , @xmath22 the heaviside function , @xmath23 the electron charge , @xmath24 the boltzmann constant and @xmath25 the reduced planck constant .",
    "the intraband contribution dominates for large doping @xmath26 and is a generalization of the drude model for the case of arbitrary band structure , whereas the interband contribution dominates for large frequencies @xmath27 .",
    "when the wavevector of the incident plane wave is perpendicular to the wire axis , the scattering problem can be decomposed into two independent scalar problems : electric field parallel to the main section of the cylindrical surface ( p polarization , magnetic field along @xmath6 ) and magnetic field parallel to the main section of the cylindrical surface ( s polarization , electric field along @xmath6 ) . in region @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and for each polarization mode we denote by @xmath30 the non - zero component of the total electromagnetic field along the axis of the cylinder , evaluated at the observation point @xmath31 .",
    "these field components must satisfy helmholtz equations in each region @xmath32 as in the case of uncoated cylinders @xcite , the starting point for the derivation of an exact expression for the scattered field is green s second integral . using in the exterior region and separating the total field in this region into contributions from the incident and scattered field , @xmath33",
    ", we obtain @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a point on the boundary @xmath7 with arc element @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the green function of in the exterior region .",
    "analogously , using green s second integral and in the interior region , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the green function of in the interior region . due to the cylindrical symmetry",
    "both green functions may be expressed in terms of the zeroth - order hankel function of the first kind @xmath41 , @xmath42 with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . by letting the point of observation * r * approach the surface * r * in expressions and , we obtain a pair of integral equations with four unknown functions : the values of the fields @xmath45 and of their normal derivatives @xmath46 , j=1,2 , at the boundary @xmath7 . as in the case of uncoated cylinders ,",
    "the number of unknowns can be reduced to two since the electromagnetic boundary conditions at @xmath7 provide two additional relationships between the normal derivatives and the fields at the boundary .",
    "taking into account that because of the graphene coating the tangential components of the magnetic field * h * are no longer continuous across the boundary @xmath7 as they were in the case of uncoated cylinders the boundary conditions for our case can be expressed as @xmath47 for @xmath48-polarization , and @xmath49 for @xmath50-polarization . in equations and the fields and their normal derivatives",

    "the boundary conditions allow us to express @xmath52 and @xmath53 in terms of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , eqs and can be rewritten as a set of coupled , inhomogeneous integral equations for the unknown exterior functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 . to find these functions ,",
    "the system of integral equations is converted into matrix equations which are then solved numerically .",
    "we do this by using a set @xmath56 $ ] for discretizing the interval where the parameter @xmath9 describing the boundary varies .",
    "the evaluation of the matrix elements and the treatment of the hankel functions singularities when the argument is zero follows closely that described in @xcite .",
    "once the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are known , the scattered field , given by the second term in , can be calculated at every point in the exterior region .",
    "yet another application of green s second integral in the interior region gives the following expression for the field at every point inside the wire @xmath57 @xmath58 where the boundary conditions and must be used to obtain the interior source functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 in terms of the exterior source functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "knowing the total electromagnetic field allows us to calculate optical characteristics such as the scattering , absorption , and extinction cross sections @xcite .",

    "<S> we present a rigorous electromagnetic method based on green s second identity for studying the plasmonic response of graphene  coated wires of arbitrary shape . </S>",
    "<S> the wire is illuminated perpendicular to its axis by a monochromatic electromagnetic wave and the wire substrate is homogeneous and isotropic . the field is expressed everywhere in terms of two unknown source functions evaluated on the graphene coating which can be obtained from the numerical solution of a coupled pair of inhomogeneous integral equations . to assess the validity of the green formulation , the scattering and absorption efficiencies obtained numerically in the particular case of circular wires are compared with those obtained from the multipolar mie theory . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent agreement is observed in this particular case , both for metallic and dielectric substrates . to explore the effects that the break of the rotational symmetry of the wire section introduces in the plasmonic features of the scattering and absorption response , </S>",
    "<S> the green formulation is applied to the case of graphene - coated wires of elliptical section . </S>",
    "<S> as might be expected from symmetry arguments , we find a two - dimensional anisotropy in the angular optical response of the wire , particularly evident in the frequency splitting of multipolar plasmonic resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the spectral position of the enhancements in the scattering and absorption efficiency spectra for low  </S>",
    "<S> eccentricity elliptical and circular wires allows us to guess the multipolar order of each plasmonic resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we present calculations of the near field distribution for different frequencies which explicitly reveal the multipolar order of the plasmonic resonances . </S>",
    "<S> they also confirm the previous guess and serve as a further test on the validity of the green formulation . </S>"
