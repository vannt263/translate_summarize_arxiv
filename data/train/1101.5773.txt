    "wave propagation in an ideal incompressible fluid is a classical matter of investigation in mathematical physics .",
    "especially , surface gravity waves have been intensively studied and many model equations were introduced to handle this problem .",
    "such studies are in a large part motivated by the fact that the initial three - dimensional water wave problem is not tractable analytically .",
    "traditionally , the subject was studied in two almost separated domains : _ shallow water models _ and _ deep water models_.    the shallow water theory is widely known .",
    "the irrotational or rotational euler equations have been approximated from several sides .",
    "an approach is based on the use of two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 measures the amplitude @xmath3 of the perturbation with respect to the depth @xmath4 and @xmath5 measures the depth with respect to the wavelength @xmath6 .",
    "assuming @xmath0 and @xmath1 smaller than one , a perturbative procedure is carried out",
    ". then model equations are obtained by retaining only the lowest order terms in @xmath7 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "another well - established approach for the derivation of shallow water model equations is the reductive perturbation method @xcite based on the gardner - morikawa transformation @xcite .",
    "it enables us to introduce slow space and time variables able to describe the effect of nonlinearity and dispersion asymptotically in space and time .",
    "an alternative method was introduced by serre @xcite and several years later by su and gardner @xcite and green and naghdi @xcite .",
    "it is based on an ansatz which uses the shallow water limit of the exact linear solution of the rotational euler equations .",
    "this way were obtained the nonlinear shallow water @xcite , the boussinesq @xcite , the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) , the modified kdv ( mkdv ) @xcite , the kadomtsev - petviashvili @xcite , the benjamin - bona - mahony - peregrine @xcite , the serre , the green - naghdi and more recently the camassa - holm @xcite equations .",
    "all these model equations govern the asymptotic dynamics of _ wave - profiles of long - waves in shallow water_.    the deep water limit consists in considering an infinite depth ( @xmath8 ) in the euler equations .",
    "then neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 can be defined .",
    "the gardner - morikawa transformation , based on the dispersionless shallow water linear limit of the euler equations , can not be defined any more because the deep water limit is fully dispersive .",
    "consequently , surface wave propagation in deep water is mainly concerned with the _ nonlinear modulation of wave trains_. the most representative model equation is the ubiquitous nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xcite . for a full account on modulation of short wave trains in water of intermediate or great depth see mei @xcite . however",
    ", some model equations have been given for wave profile evolution in deep water .",
    "e.g. , in reference @xcite is derived a finite - depth boussinesq - type equation for the profile of irrotational free surface waves .",
    "the derivation is carried out via the theory of analytic functions followed by a perturbation procedure .",
    "its deep water limit is exhibited as a function of integral operators .",
    "the benjamin - ono equation , first introduced by t. benjamin @xcite and h. ono @xcite , is worth being mentioned .",
    "it is a nonlinear partial integro - differential equation which describes one - dimensional internal wave profile evolution in deep water . in reference",
    "@xcite an approach analogous the one we develop in the present paper was introduced .",
    "other model equations whose solutions behave as deep water waves can be found in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their dispersion relations coincide exactly with that of water waves in infinitely deep water and the nonlinear terms are chosen in a _",
    "ad hoc _ way in order to reproduce the stokes limiting wave .",
    "the present work is the extension of a long sequel of studies carried out by the authors in various physical contexts , dealing with model equations for nonlinear and dispersive short wave dynamics ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "especially , the purpose of the paper is to study the dynamics of an elementary wave profile in deep water . instead of looking for modulation dynamics of a wave train , we seek for the combined effects of dispersion and nonlinearity on a given _ fourier component _ with wave vector @xmath9 . our approach is a generalization of the method firstly used by serre for surface waves in shallow water .",
    "we assume an ansatz based on the exact linear solution of the euler system for deep water .",
    "of course , as in the shallow water case , the ansatz does not yield an exact solution of the full euler system .",
    "it produces a _ depth - average model equation _",
    ", which is expected to be valid close to the linear limit of the euler system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ sec : euler ] ) we introduce the euler equations in deep water . in section ( [ sec : linear pattern ] ) , after a brief summary of the `` modus operandi '' of the linear pattern ansatz in the shallow water limit , we generalize it to the deep water case . in section ( [ sec : water wave problem ] ) we give the nondimensionalisation of the euler equations and we introduce the deep water surface wave problem . in section ( [ sec : serre ] ) we introduce the serre approximation in the deep water context and we derive a nonlinear and dispersive system of equations for the free surface elevation and for the free surface velocity . in section ( [ sec : small aspect ] ) we derive a small - aspect - ratio wave equation in deep water . in section ( [ sec : mathematical ] ) are exhibited the mathematical properties of the model : the lax pair , the relation with the integrable bullough - dodd model and the symmetries . in section ( [ sec : stokes ] ) is studied the progressive periodic wave solution and the limiting wave .",
    "the work is completed with a numerical study of the limiting wave . in the appendix",
    "we give some detail on the derivation of the bullough - dodd equation and finally section ( [ sec : conclusion ] ) draws the conclusions .",
    "we considerer the dimensional euler equations for deep water .",
    "let the particles of the fluid be located relative to a fix rectangular cartesian frame with origin @xmath10 and axes @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the upward vertical direction .",
    "we assume translational symmetry along @xmath13 and we will only consider a sheet of fluid parallel to the @xmath14 plane .",
    "the velocity of the fluid is @xmath15 .",
    "the fluid sheet is moving on a bottom at @xmath16 , and its upper free surface is located at @xmath17 . the continuity equation and the newton equations ( in the flow domain )",
    "read as @xmath18 in which subscripts denote partial derivatives , and the dot ( @xmath19 ) denotes the material derivative defined by @xmath20 the boundary conditions at @xmath16 and at @xmath21 are @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the constant density of the water , @xmath24 the gravitation constant and @xmath25 the atmospheric pressure .",
    "the solution of the problem consists in finding @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "approximate solutions to the nonlinear surface water waves problem can be computed only if the @xmath29 dependence of the velocity field @xmath27 is known .",
    "the @xmath29 dependence provides a coupling between the wave motion at the surface and the wave motion at various depths . in the linear case",
    "the @xmath29 dependence is known , hence the solution is exactly known .",
    "expansions in power series of of @xmath29 as well as the theory of harmonic functions have been used to solve this problem in the nonlinear and potential euler equations .",
    "another approach to the problem is the use of an ansatz based on the linear @xmath29 dependence of @xmath27 .",
    "it is _ the linear pattern ansatz _ introduced in references @xcite , in the shallow water context , and equivalent to the widely known _",
    "columnar hypothesis_. it is thus worthy to begin with a brief description of how the ansatz works in the shallow water case , before we extend it to the deep water context .",

    "( [ shalu ] ) .",
    "@xmath36 is a wave crest moving at the phase velocity @xmath37 given by @xmath38.\\ ] ] the linear pattern ansatz assumes that the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath32 is the same as the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath31 , and that its spatiotemporal behavior is given by an undetermined function @xmath39 .",
    "so , serre has assumed that @xmath40 which corresponds to the extreme long wave limit in ( [ shalu ] ) , i.e , @xmath32 does not depend on @xmath29 .",
    "since the phase velocity is invariant under @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 the ansatz does not need to take into account the direction of propagation in @xmath39 .    _",
    "the deep water ansatz .",
    "_ we propose in the present paper an analogous procedure in the deep water case .",
    "nevertheless two important differences arise .",
    "the first one is that in the deep water case , according to eqs .",
    "( [ cont]-[bc3 ] ) , we have @xmath43 so , the phase velocity @xmath37 is no longer invariant under @xmath44 and expressions ( [ deppul ] ) , ( [ deppomega ] ) and ( [ deppc ] ) are strictly valid for wave crests moving to the right only .",
    "consequently , the ansatz would take into account the choice of the propagation direction made in deriving the linear solution .",
    "the second difference is a very subtle one .",
    "here we are interested in the effect of nonlinearity and dispersion on a purely sinusoidal wave of wave vector @xmath9 and frequency @xmath45 for large @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". however , wave vectors and frequencies are no longer constant in dispersive system , and are generalized to the concepts of local wave vector @xmath48 and local frequency @xmath49 .",
    "there will then be a non - uniform local wave train ( nearly sinusoidal ) with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath48 and @xmath49 remain constant for an observer moving at the group velocity @xmath52 .",
    "thus , to study the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath46 and @xmath47 of a wave with given wave vector @xmath9 in deep water , the analysis must be carried out in the frame @xmath53 traveling at the velocity @xmath54 with respect to the frame @xmath55 where the euler equations ( [ cont]-[bc3 ] ) are written .",
    "therefore , the linear pattern ansatz we propose is @xmath56",
    "the first step is to nondimensionalise equations ( [ cont]-[bc3 ] ) .",
    "hence the original variables of space , time , velocity components and pressure will be normalized with @xmath9 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the wave vector of the wave to be described .",
    "hence the euler equations for @xmath60 become @xmath61 and the boundary conditions are @xmath62 we integrate the euler equation in the depth of the fluid . from equation ( [ cont2 ] ) and boundary condition ( [ bc1.2 ] ) we get @xmath63 this expression for @xmath64 allows us to write the material derivatives @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 as @xmath67 using ( [ wpunto ] ) into ( [ newz2 ] ) , integrating with respect to @xmath29 and making use of ( [ bc2.2 ] ) , we obtain the pressure @xmath68 as @xmath69 note that expression ( [ intpresion ] ) for the pressure diverges as @xmath70 in _ archimedian way _ as it is expected to . the newton equation ( [ newx2 ] ) reads , using ( [ intpresion ] ) , as @xmath71 now using leibnitz s rule in the integrals in the right hand side we obtain @xmath72 with @xmath73 . finally equation ( [ bc3.2 ] )",
    "expresses as @xmath74 if the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath32 was known , the surface wave problem in deep water could be solved : eq .",
    "( [ intpresion ] ) gives the pressure @xmath28 , while equations ( [ newx3 ] ) ( evaluated in @xmath75 ) and ( [ bc3.3 ] ) yield a system of coupled nonlinear equations for @xmath76 and @xmath26 , which completes the solution of the problem .",
    "however this is not the case because @xmath32 is unknown versus @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath32 is the central issue making unsolvable the nonlinear surface water wave problem in deep water as in shallow one .",
    "consequently we use the deep water ansatz ( [ udeep ] ) , which reads in dimensionless variables as @xmath77 it implies the change in the differential operators : @xmath78 then we obtain from ( [ newx3 ] ) the expression @xmath79 this equation is now taken into account through an averaging over the full depth of the fluid , defined by the expression @xmath80 applying ( [ zaverage ] ) to ( [ expression ] ) we obtain @xmath81\\right\\}_{\\xi}-\\eta_{\\xi}= 0.\\ ] ] finally , substituting ( [ anzatdimen ] ) into ( [ bc3.3 ] ) we get @xmath82 note that we did not assume that either @xmath83 or @xmath84 vanish as @xmath85 .",

    "@xmath29-average _ of the euler equations resulting from the flow hypothesis ( [ anzatdimen ] ) and the subsequent average in the depth ( [ zaverage ] ) .",
    "it is _ a deep water analogous _ of the serre ( or green - naghdi or su - gardner ) system .",
    "it differs from the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "the latter is a _",
    "weighted @xmath29-integration _ of the euler equations .",
    "the crucial step there was the use of a precise weight in order to regularize the archimedian divergence term present in the pressure . in turn",
    "this produces a _ weight - dependent model _ the degeneration of which is eliminated by the requirement that the linear limit possesses phase and group velocities equal to those of the deep water system .",
    "the present derivation does not need either the weighted average procedure or the _ ad doc hypothesis _ of equality between the linear limits . both of them , _",
    "@xmath29-average _ and _ weighted @xmath29-integration _ , coincide in the classical _ shallow water _ case .    assuming that @xmath83 , @xmath84 vanish for @xmath85 , and setting @xmath86 , system ( [ gndw1 ] ) and ( [ gndw2 ] ) can be reduced to the integro - differential model for @xmath83  : @xmath87_\\xi = 0\\;.\\ ] ] this equation for @xmath83 is close to classical formulations of model equations for surface waves in deep water , which are integro - differential models .",
    "up to this point the asymptotic behavior in @xmath88 and @xmath47 of the surface wave profile was not considered .",
    "this can be performed by taking advantage of some small parameter present in the system .",
