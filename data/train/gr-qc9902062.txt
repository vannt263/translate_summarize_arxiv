    "gravitational wave signals from perturbed black holes typically show waveforms with strong quasinormal ( qn ) ringing , damped oscillations at a period and damping rate characteristic of the mass and angular momentum of the hole .",
    "if the source of perturbations of the hole has no inherent time scale ( as it would , for example , in the case of a particle scattered@xcite or plunging into the hole@xcite ) then qn ringing completely dominates the appearance of the waveform . indeed",
    ", most perturbation computations show waveforms that contain only an initial transient and qn ringing .",
    "the meaning of qn ringing has been well studied in the mathematical context of perturbation calculations ( einstein s field equations linearized about a black hole background ) .",
    "qn ringing , however , has also found to dominate the waveforms of black hole processes computed with numerical solutions of the full nonlinear set of einstein s equations@xcite .    unlike black holes ,",
    "neutron stars have inherent time scales associated with the various possible modes of fluid motion .",
    "these fluid modes can be understood , and analyzed approximately with a semi - newtonian approach : the excitations and frequencies of the fluid modes are analyzed with newtonian mechanics , and the fluid motions are treated as a source in the equations of weak field general relativity .",
    "the emission of gravitational waves , in these calculations , damps the periodic fluid oscillations of newtonian theory , but due to the weak coupling to gravitational waves these fluid qn modes are weakly damped .",
    "by contrast , the qn modes of a schwarzschild black hole are strongly damped , with damping times of the same order as their period .",
    "the sharp distinction between the nature of neutron star qn modes and black hole qn modes ended when studies of neutron star models by kojima@xcite and kokkotas and schutz@xcite revealed the existence of modes that had no newtonian counterpart .",
    "these modes , called @xmath0 modes ( for wave modes ) are general relativistic in their origin and are similar to black hole qn modes in that they are quickly damped . that @xmath0 modes are distinct from fluid modes is particularly clear in the existence of odd - parity @xmath0 modes .",
    "the quantities describing the perturbations of a spherical stellar model break up into two sets of quantities , called even and odd parity , which are not coupled by the perturbed field equations .",
    "the even parity set includes all the information about fluid motion@xcite .",
    "the odd parity set includes no fluid perturbations .",
    "it describes purely relativistic modes that are perturbations only of the background geometry .",
    "chandrasekhar and ferrari@xcite showed that sufficiently compact homogeneous neutron star models had odd parity qn modes .",
    "later studies @xcite not only confirmed these results but also showed that these odd modes exist for all degrees of stellar compactness and that the less compact the star is , the more rapidly damped are its modes .",
    "odd parity modes of neutron stars with realistic equations of state have also been computed recently @xcite .    in the next few years",
    "the vibrations of neutron stars may be of more than academic interest .",
    "neutron star processes , in various forms , are among the most plausible sources of gravitational waves that may be within the reach of detectors like ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama300 and others .",
    "though the @xmath0 modes are at frequencies above the range of high sensitivity for interferometric detectors@xcite , they may be interesting sources for resonant bar detectors . in 1996 ,",
    "andersson and kokkotas@xcite pointed out that much work on neutron star dynamics was still being done in newtonian theory and these studies , in principle , excluded the fundamentally relativistic @xmath0 modes .",
    "andersson and kokkotas particularly directed attention to the question that is most important about the @xmath0 modes : to what extent are they excited in astrophysical processes .",
    "more specifically one should ask about the relative excitation of the semi - newtonian fluid modes and the fundamentally relativistic @xmath0 modes in a real astrophysical process .",
    "the key difficulty here lies in the question of what is an acceptable model of a `` real astrophysical process . ''",
    "those processes which are of greatest interest as sources of detectable waves are the oscillations of a neutron star formed in a supernova collapse or formed by the coalescence of two neutron stars as the last stage of binary inspiral . the numerical modelling of such processes with general relativistic codes is beyond near term computational capability , so `` real '' processes can not be simulated . on the other hand",
    "it is not adequate to choose any convenient source of perturbations .",
    "andersson and kokkotas ( @xcite ) , for instance , gave an example of the excitation of qn ringing of neutron stars by impinging gravitational waves .",
    "it is plausible that the relative excitation of @xmath0 modes and fluid modes for such a source is not representative of how modes would be excited by astrophysical processes .",
    "this might be said also of any source of perturbations chosen arbitrarily .",
    "the model we investigate here avoids arbitrariness by using a specific physical process .",
    "we consider a nonrotating neutron star of mass @xmath1 and radius @xmath2 .",
    "an object of mass @xmath3 passes by the neutron star on a geodesic trajectory that is the general relativistic equivalent of a hyperbolic orbit .",
    "we make the `` particle '' approximation in which @xmath4 and the field equations are expanded in the perturbation parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we study the dependence of excitation on the two parameters of the particle orbits , the particle energy and angular momentum .",
    "neutron star models considered are limited to relativistic polytropes . in principle , our `` incontrovertibly astrophysical '' model would give a definitive answer to the question of the relative excitation of fluid modes and @xmath0 modes .",
    "but in practice the present paper gives only a partial answer and represents only a first step . here , for simplicity",
    ", we consider only odd parity modes .",
    "the absence of coupling between odd parity perturbations and fluid motions makes the odd parity case much simpler to analyze , but it also means that there is no excitation of fluid modes with which comparisons can be made .",
    "what can be achieved is a comparison of gravitational radiation in @xmath0 modes , and gravitational radiation directly due to the moving particle . in this sense",
    "the present work also shows the parameter values for which @xmath0 mode excitation is significant .",
    "these results are of interest by themselves and probably indicate the systematics of the even parity excitations .",
    "we present results for odd parity radiation from a range of particle trajectories and we use these results to speculate about the importance of @xmath0 modes in astrophysical processes .",
    "we also demonstrate that the study of the excitation of strongly damped qn modes is better carried out with waveforms than with spectra .",
    "an additional point inherent in our results is that qn ringing of higher multipoles is excited as strongly as that of quadrupole modes , though this conclusion is probably a feature only of models involving perturbations of a neutron star by a relativistic particle .",
    "the remaining sections are organized as follows .",
    "sec.[model ] introduces the model problem .",
    "the wave equation describing the odd parity perturbations appear in sec.[waveq ] , the analysis of the solution with fourier transforms is given in sec.[ft ] , and the method of computing solutions is presented in sec.[compimp ] .",

    "qn ringing of @xmath0 modes make a unique , high frequency , change in the appearance of waveforms .",
    "even if qn ringing is only weakly excited it would in principle be easily recognizable and , as pointed out by andersson and kokkotas@xcite , would provide important information about the structure of the neutron star emitting the waves .",
    "our results above show that @xmath129 , and higher multipoles , tend to be excited on the same order as @xmath127 modes for scattering orbits .",
    "this is a somewhat unusual finding since gravitational processes tend to be dominated by quadrupole radiation .",
    "significant higher multipole radiation may be specific to scattering by relativistic orbits of a `` particle '' ( with negligible angular extent ) , and may not be generalizable to more astrophysically plausible sources . if these higher @xmath125 modes do turn out to be as highly excited as the @xmath127 mode , the modes will all be mixed together in the waveform recorded by a detector ; a detector at a single location can not `` project out '' individual multipole moments as we have done in the figures presented above .",
    "the signal from a neutron star could then be a highly complex pattern that in principle contains a great deal of information about the neutron star . in practice ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio , and the breadth of the qn `` lines '' would make it very unlikely that qn mode spectroscopy could reveal the details of neutron star structure .",
    "another practical consideration is that the @xmath0 mode frequencies ( typically @xmath205hz ) are well above the upper limit ( several hundred hz ) of laser interferometric detectors , the detectors that are most capable of detecting waveforms .",
    "the @xmath0 mode frequencies , of course , scale inversely as the mass of the neutron star . but",
    "this is of little consequence , since neutron star masses are constrained to a very small range . by contrast",
    "there is at least the possibility for black holes of large enough mass ( hundreds of solar masses ) that qn ringing will be within the optimal bandwidth of interferometric detectors .    from the representative waveforms and spectra",
    "presented we can infer that the lowest frequencies of gravitational radiation are negligibly affected unless qn ringing is very strong , and hence for a laser interferometric detector , an analysis omitting general relativistic effects would be satisfactory .",
    "on the other hand , for a detector with sensitivity extending to hundreds of kilohertz , the @xmath0 mode contribution could be very important .",
    "the ringing of @xmath0 modes provides a high frequency component of the spectrum that could contain more energy than that due `` directly '' to the particle .",
    "for that reason it is of some interest to look through the neutron star results to make inferences about the conditions necessary for @xmath0 modes to be strongly excited .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that the excitation of @xmath0 modes is largest when the particle frequency is closest to the real part of the qn frequency .",
    "this conclusion , however , is somewhat uncertain .",
    "the particle frequencies are always below the qn frequency , so a _ higher _ particle frequency is the same as a particle frequency that is _ closer _ to the qn resonance .",
    "the most important determinant of the particle frequency is the turning point radius @xmath137 , and smaller @xmath137 will produce higher particle frequency , and hence a particle frequency closer to the qn resonance . but a smaller @xmath137 also means that the source of the disturbance to the neutron star is closer and hence is better able to excite qn ringing .    the difference between these two interpretations is important if we try to generalize from the above results to neutron star processes that arise more naturally astrophysically . in this connection",
    "it is helpful to turn attention to the ( astrophysically implausible ) ultracompact stellar model of fig .",
    "[ homogstarr=2.33wformspect ] . in the @xmath206 model",
    "the two least damped qn modes have almost negligible imaginary parts , so the resonance picture would imply that excitation could be stimulated only by the high frequency tail of the particle radiation , which is negligible at the qn `` resonant '' frequency ( the real part of the qn frequency ) .",
    "in spite of this the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ homogstarr=2.33wformspect]b is far from a particle spectrum .",
    "there is in fact more radiation in the high frequency part of the spectrum than in the low .",
    "this implies that care must be used in applying the ideas of normal mode systems to qn modes , and that excitation may be much larger than a simple resonance model would suggest .    for the models that are astrophysically most relevant , those with @xmath189 , the model results suggest that even the source most tightly coupled to the qn modes ( i.e. , even the smallest turning point ) can stimulate only moderate ringing",
    "this may be associated with the very short damping times for these stellar models and may not apply to stellar models with longer damping times@xcite .",
    "if we disregard such possibilities , and assume that the qn frequencies of stellar models are similar to those of polytropic equations of state , we infer that @xmath0 mode effects on the radiation from scattering orbits are not of crucial significance .",
    "we conjecture that supernova core collapse or the coalescence at the end point of binary inspiral will couple no better to @xmath0 modes than do scattering orbits . for @xmath189 models , then , @xmath0 modes will be of crucial importance only if the source of spacetime perturbations does not stimulate any radiation due to fluid motion , as is the case for excitation of ringing by an odd parity gravitational wave .",

    "scattered geodesics require @xmath208 . the higher the energy of the particle the more relativistic it is ( when @xmath209 the particle falls with zero initial velocity ) . for a given energy",
    "there is a minimum angular momentum if the particle moves in one of these geodesics ( see ex .",
    "it is @xmath210 if @xmath211 and @xmath212 if @xmath209",
    ". if the particle has smaller angular momentum and still moves along a geodesic than it will plunge into the star ( or black hole ) .",
    "the equality happens for a particle moving in a circular geodesic .",
    "the turning point is the largest of the two positive roots of the cubic equation ( the third root is always negative ) @xmath213 we can find it numerically by noting that it is always located in the region @xmath214 and that the other positive root is always located outside this region . for a given energy , the smaller the angular momentum of the particle is , the smaller @xmath137 is .",
    "however the turning point is always @xmath215 in the special case @xmath209 , ( [ turn ] ) becomes a quadratic equation and the turning point can be written in analytical form @xmath216 clearly @xmath217 in this case .",
    "once we know the turning point for a given energy and angular momentum of the particle , we can determine the other two roots of ( [ turn ] ) easily .",
    "we need first to compute the parameters @xmath218 ( see for ex .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath219 ( note that @xmath220 if @xmath209 ) after what we can rewrite ( [ turn ] ) like @xmath221 with the three roots given by @xmath222    if we choose the origin of coordinate time t , angle @xmath97 and proper time @xmath223 at the turning point then the value of these quantities at a given value of the radial coordinate @xmath87 will be determined by the geodesic equations , @xmath224 with the @xmath225 sign holding for the part of the motion from infinity to @xmath137 and the @xmath226 sign for the part of the motion from @xmath137 to infinity .",
    "although the above integrals are finite , their integrands diverge at the turning point , making difficult their numerical computation .",
    "a possible remedy is to make a change of variable that makes the integrands finite over all the range of integration .",
