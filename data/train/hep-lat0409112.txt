    "in this talk i report on some recent work which was done in collaboration with julius kuti @xcite . the as - yet unobserved higgs boson plays a crucial role in determining the threshold of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "precision electroweak measurements indicate that , if the sm is correct , the higgs is light with a mass @xmath0  gev @xcite . even if one excludes these experimental constraints , it is widely believed on theoretical grounds that the higgs mass must lie within a certain range for the sm to be an acceptable field theory .",
    "[ fig : pdg ] shows the current phenomenological upper and lower @xmath1 bounds as a function of @xmath2 , the energy scale at which physics beyond the sm must set in @xcite .",
    "upper and lower bounds are very important for two reasons .",
    "firstly , they tell us where we should look for the higgs . for example , according to fig .  [",
    "fig : pdg ] , the sm can not sustain a higgs as heavy as 1  tev . secondly and more importantly , if the higgs is observed , knowing its mass would tell us the maximum energy scale up to which the sm can be valid . according to this plot , the lower bound is the relevant one for current phenomenology .",
    "for example , taking the preferred value @xmath3  gev , the sm is at most valid up to around @xmath4  tev .",
    "the phenomenological lower bound is based on the instability of the higgs potential if @xmath1 is too small .",
    "we will show that this vacuum instability , like the landau pole , is fake .",
    "remarkably , just like the upper bound , a new regulator - dependent lower bound emerges from the triviality of the theory . an earlier version of this work was presented in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : lowerbound ] corresponds to the higgs lower bound at @xmath78  gev .",
    "it is quite natural that the higgs lower bound is attained when the bare higgs coupling @xmath75 .",
    "previous studies of the pure higgs @xmath79 theory showed that the @xmath1 upper bound is reached when @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "one important consideration is that the lower bound is regulator - dependent .",
    "consider the @xmath51 limit of the higgs - yukawa model , where perturbation theory becomes exact .",
    "we compare the higgs lower bound , calculated using three different regulators : a hard cut - off in the momentum integration , a lattice regulator , and a higher - derivative propagator @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : regulator ] we plot the higgs lower bound for a fixed top mass .",
    "even when the cut - off is quite large , the lower bound varies by as much as 20% among these three regulators .",
    "this is a feature of trivial theories which can not be ignored  when the cut - off is finite , not all quantities are universal . for any given regulator , one can calculate the higgs lower bound to whatever desired accuracy .",
    "however , one can not make arbitrarily accurate predictions which are regulator - independent .",
    "there is an inherent ambiguity in the bound and one can at best estimate the energy scale where the theory is no longer physically acceptable .",
    "we have examined a toy higgs - yukawa model of one real scalar field coupled to @xmath5 degenerate fermions .",
    "earlier studies of higgs - yukawa models were reported in @xcite . to make a quantitative statement relevant for the standard model , one needs to study a more physical model .",
    "a realistic approximation would be an @xmath82 higgs doublet ( corresponding to an @xmath77-symmetric scalar field ) coupled to a single fermion flavor ( the top quark ) .",
    "gluons should also be included , as the qcd coupling makes a significant contribution to the rg flow of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom of the standard model are expected to play a negligible role in the lower bound .",
    "if it is only possible to calculate the lower bound via lattice simulations , a gluon - higgs - top model is a very challenging system to explore .",
    "the only completely satisfactory way to represent a single massless fermion flavor on the lattice is to use a chiral ginsparg - wilson fermion @xcite , which is computationally very demanding . coupled to fluctuating scalar fields , the positivity of the fermion determinant in the functional integral is not guaranteed , and must be examined in the higgs phase of the theory .",
    "if the probability distribution in the functional integral can be negative , this could make numerical computations very difficult ( the so - call sign problem ) .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in lattice qcd and how light a quark mass is possible in practical numerical simulations , which is very sensitive to the nature of the lattice fermion . despite these challenges ,",
    "we believe a realistic lattice study of a gluon - higgs - top system can make a significant and timely contribution to current tests of the standard model .",
