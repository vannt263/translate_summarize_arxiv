    "numerous interacting electron systems undergo a quantum phase transition @xcite between ground states with different symmetries , which can be tuned by a non - thermal control parameter such as doping , pressure , or a magnetic field . in the vicinity of a continuous transition electronic excitations",
    "are strongly scattered by critical order parameter fluctuations , such that fermi liquid theory breaks down.@xcite quantum critical fluctuations near a quantum critical point ( qcp ) are therefore frequently invoked as a mechanism for non - fermi liquid behavior in strongly correlated electron compounds .",
    "quantum criticality in metallic electron systems is traditionally described by an effective order parameter theory which was pioneered by hertz @xcite and extended to finite temperatures by millis .",
    "@xcite in that approach an order parameter field @xmath3 is introduced via a hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the electron - electron interaction , and the electronic variables are subsequently integrated out .",
    "the resulting effective action @xmath4 $ ] for the order parameter is truncated at quartic order and analyzed by standard scaling techniques .",
    "however , several studies revealed that the hertz - millis approach may fail , especially in low - dimensional systems.@xcite since electronic excitations in a metal are gapless , integrating out the electrons may lead to singular interactions between the order parameter fluctuations which can not be approximated by a local quartic term .",
    "the nature of the problem and essential aspects of its solution were presented first for disordered ferromagnets by kirkpatrick and belitz.@xcite for clean ferromagnets , belitz et al.@xcite showed that hertz - millis theory breaks down , and no continuous quantum phase transition can exist , in any dimension @xmath5 ; the transition is generically of first order.@xcite the hertz - millis approach was also shown to be invalid for the quantum antiferromagnetic transition in two dimensions .",
    "@xcite in that case a continuous transition survives , but the qcp becomes non - gaussian .    in this article we analyze the validity of the hertz - millis approach to quantum criticality for two - dimensional systems with singular _ forward scattering _ of electrons , in particular systems exhibiting a quantum phase transition driven by forward scattering in the charge channel .",
    "the most prominent such transition is the electronic _",
    "nematic _ , in which an orientation symmetry is spontaneously broken ,",
    "while translation and spin - rotation invariance remain unaffected.@xcite the problem of quantum critical points with singular forward scattering is formally similar to the problem of non - relativistic fermions coupled to a @xmath2 gauge field , which was studied intensively in the 1990s .",
    "@xcite    perturbation theory for the electronic self - energy at the nematic qcp yields a non - fermi liquid contribution proportional to @xmath6 already at the lowest order in a loop expansion.@xcite the same behavior was found earlier for fermions coupled to a @xmath2 gauge field.@xcite it was commonly believed that the power - law with an exponent @xmath7 is not modified by higher order contributions .",
    "furthermore , calculations in the gauge field context suggested that the simple form of the ( bosonic ) fluctuation propagator obtained in lowest order ( rpa ) remains unaffected by higher order terms.@xcite in a remarkable recent paper metlitski and sachdev @xcite formulated a scaling theory of the nematic qcp and related problems , treating the electrons and order parameter fluctuations on equal footing . in a renormalization group calculation",
    "they found a logarithmic divergence at three - loop order pointing at a correction of the @xmath6 law for the electronic self - energy .",
    "however , no qualitative correction was found for the fluctuation propagator , up to three - loop order.@xcite this is in stark contrast to the case of an antiferromagnetic qcp in two dimensions , where the fluctuation propagator is substantially renormalized compared to the rpa form.@xcite a clarification of the properties of the nematic qcp beyond three - loop order is still lacking .",
    "the robustness of the fluctuation propagator at the nematic qcp seems to indicate that interactions of the order parameter fluctuations are irrelevant such that the qcp is gaussian , in agreement with the expectations from hertz - millis theory .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to analyze the interaction terms in the effective action @xmath4 $ ] obtained after integrating out the electrons .",

    "is non - trivial , because the most naive power - counting is easily invalidated by cancellations.@xcite in this paper we compute the exact scaling behavior of the @xmath0-point interactions for the nematic qcp and related systems .",
    "we find that the interactions are _ marginal _ and _ non - local _ for all @xmath8 .",

    "note that the power - counting does not change if the bare propagator @xmath212 in the @xmath0-point loops is replaced by a propagator @xmath213 with a self - energy proportional to @xmath214 , since this interacting propagator also diverges as @xmath210 .",
    "now that we have determined the scaling behavior of the @xmath0-point loop in the collinear low - energy limit , we can assess the relevance of the @xmath0-point order parameter interactions in the effective action @xmath4 $ ] by using standard power counting . to see how the interaction terms evolve compared to the quadratic part of the action , we rescale the field @xmath3 in such a way that the bare critical action @xmath215 $ ] , eq .",

    "hence , the effective order parameter action can not be truncated at any finite order .",
    "at least such a truncation is not justified by power counting .",
    "furthermore , the interaction terms have singular momentum and energy dependences , which can not be represented by local interactions .    whether the gaussian fixed point remains stable or not depends therefore entirely on the behavior of fluctuation contributions .",
    "to get an idea one might compute low order fluctuation corrections to @xmath220 $ ] and @xmath221 $ ] .",
    "metlitski and sachdev @xcite have shown that the bare gaussian propagator @xmath58 does not receive qualitative modifications up to three - loop order in the coupled fermion - boson theory underlying the effective action @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "@xcite obtaining a general conclusion on the fate of the gaussian fixed point seems difficult , however , since the theory has no obvious expansion parameter .",

    "the limit is still collinear and `` static '' ( in the sense that frequencies scale to zero faster than the modulus of momenta ) . in light of the results for @xmath226",
    "it is thus likely that the degree of divergence of the @xmath0-point loops is not reduced by cancellations in this scaling limit for @xmath231 , too , such that it can be estimated by naive power counting .",

    "finite @xmath234 interactions are even more irrelevant than in two dimensions , but one may again wonder about the special role of momentum transfers tangential to the fermi surface in a certain fermi point ( and its antipode ) , which are mutually _ coplanar_. considering the coplanar low - energy scaling limit @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 , one expects a divergence @xmath238 for @xmath1 .",

    "the @xmath0-point interactions are given by symmetrized fermionic loops with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "we have shown that these loops exhibit a singular momentum and energy dependence for all @xmath8 , so that they can not be represented by a local interaction . for @xmath1 , they diverge in the collinear low - energy limit , where energy variables scale to zero faster than momenta , and momenta become increasingly collinear .",
    "we have derived explicit expressions for the momentum and energy dependences in that limit .",
    "the degree of divergence is not reduced by any cancellations . from standard power counting one then obtains that all @xmath0-point interactions are marginal .",

    "@xcite it can not be truncated at any finite order and none of the @xmath0-point terms can be represented by a local interaction . in particular , approximating the interactions by a local quartic term , as in hertz theory , is inadequate .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn for the effective action describing fermions coupled to a @xmath2 gauge field .",
