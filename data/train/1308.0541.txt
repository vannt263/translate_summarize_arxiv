    "our purpose in this paper is to introduce several new objects associated with a @xmath0-structure on a riemann surface @xmath1 of finite type , and study their relationships . in the non - compact case , we assume that the projective structure is  parabolic at the cusps \" , in a sense that will be made precise below .",
    "to such a projective structure @xmath2 , we associate :    a _ lyapunov exponent _ @xmath3 , which was constructed in @xcite ;    a _ degree _",
    "@xmath4 which is simply the ( normalized ) asymptotic covering degree of the developing map @xmath5 ( @xmath6 the universal cover of @xmath1 ) ;    a family of _ harmonic measures _ @xmath7 on @xmath8 , which generalize the traditional harmonic measures on the limit sets of kleinian groups ( throughout the paper , @xmath8 stands for @xmath9 ) .    we will show that the lyapunov exponent and the degree are related by a simple formula , and give estimates for the hausdorff dimension of the harmonic measures in terms of @xmath10 .",
    "we give several applications of these ideas to the study of the space @xmath11 of ( parabolic ) projective structures on @xmath1 , in particular revealing new aspects of the famous sullivan dictionary between rational and mbius dynamics on @xmath8 .    before proceeding to a detailed presentation of these results ,",
    "let us present the main characters of the story .",
    "let us fix a riemann surface @xmath1 of finite type ( genus @xmath13 with @xmath14 punctures ) with negative euler characteristic @xmath15 , as well as a universal cover @xmath16",
    ". throughout this paper , by definition the ( unmarked ) fundamental group @xmath17 is the deck group of this covering .",
    "recall that the automorphism group of the riemann sphere is the group @xmath18 acting on @xmath19 by the formula @xmath20 . by definition a _ kleinian group _ is a discrete subgroup of @xmath21 .",
    "it is convenient to define a @xmath8-structure on @xmath1 in terms of the so - called development - holonomy pair @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath29-structure _ is an equivalence class of such pairs .",
    "we refer here to the survey paper by dumas , see  @xcite for a comprehensive treatment of this notion .",
    "when the surface @xmath1 is not compact ( hence by assumption it is biholomorphic to a compact riemann surface punctured at a finite set ) , we restrict ourselves to the subclass of _ parabolic _ @xmath12-structures .",
    "such a structure has the following well - defined local model around the punctures : each puncture has a neighborhood which is _ projectively _ equivalent to the quotient of the upper half plane by the translation @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , the canonical projective structure @xmath31 induced by uniformization ( i.e. viewing @xmath1 as a quotient of @xmath32 under a fuchsian group ) is of this type . more generally , the proof of the ahlfors finiteness theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) ) shows that if @xmath33 is any torsion free kleinian group , and @xmath34 is the orbit of a discontinuity component , then the induced projective structure on @xmath35 is parabolic .",
    "these have been known as _ covering projective structures _ , because the developing map is a covering onto its image in this case @xcite .",
    "an important example is given by quasi - fuchsian deformations of the canonical structure @xmath31 .",
    "there are many other examples of parabolic @xmath12-structures .",
    "for instance surgery operations such as grafting ( see hejhal s original construction in @xcite ) may produce a parabolic @xmath12-structure with holonomy a kleinian group that is not of covering type .",
    "such projective structures are usually called _",
    "exotic_. there are yet other examples of @xmath12-structures : a remarkable theorem of gallo , kapovich and marden @xcite asserts that ( when @xmath1 is compact ) a representation @xmath36 is the holonomy of a @xmath12-structure on @xmath1 ( for some riemann surface structure on @xmath1 ) if and only if it is non elementary and it lifts to a representation with values in @xmath37 . in particular , there exist @xmath12-structures with holonomy a non discrete ( or even dense ) subgroup of @xmath18 .",
    "it is also of interest to deal with the case of _ branched @xmath8-structures _",
    ", where the local injectivity assumption on the developing map is dropped .",
    "examples include conical metrics of constant curvature equal to @xmath38 or @xmath39 , with conical points of angle multiple of @xmath40 .",

    "then the following formula holds : @xmath112    surprisingly enough , the proof is based on the ergodic theory of holomorphic foliations . indeed , to any representation @xmath113 one classically associates its _ suspension _ , a flat @xmath12-bundle @xmath114 whose monodromy is @xmath115 . in more concrete terms , it is the quotient of @xmath116 under the diagonal action of @xmath17 .",

    "this interplay was already explored by bonatti and gomez - mnt @xcite and alvarez @xcite .",
    "the key of the proof of the theorem is to interpret @xmath10 and @xmath120 as cohomological quantities on @xmath121 .",
    "the idea that foliated lyapunov exponents can be computed in cohomology stems from the first author s thesis ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "in addition we see that @xmath3 reaches its minimal value @xmath128 exactly when @xmath129 . as already observed , @xmath130 on @xmath131 , so in particular @xmath132 there .    a first result which parallels exactly the dynamics of polynomials concerns the hausdorff dimension of the harmonic measures .",
