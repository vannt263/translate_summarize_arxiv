    "typical ism power spectra are decreasing power - laws@xcite , the ensemble - averaged modulus of the visibility is thus a monotonic function of @xmath14-radius .",
    "this is also true for ldn  1622 , for the case of the 100  @xmath1 m cbi - simulated visibilities : the azimuthally averaged power - spectrum is monotonic .",
    "we can not recover a power spectrum for the cbi data by simple averaging because the signal is affected by noise , so that the derived spectrum is artificially flat .",
    "the 31  ghz flux density measured on the restored image within a circular aperture with 45  arcmin diameter centered on ldn  1622 is 1.41@xmath300.03  jy .",
    "we caution that the cbi images are heavily affected by flux loss for emission on 45  arcmin scales : because of incomplete sampling in the @xmath14 plane the reconstructed images have missing spatial frequencies , and part of the extended nebular emission is lost .",

    "thus no particular trend is found , although the average values of the shifts is @xmath43  arcmin and significantly different from zero .",
    "but in what follows we ignore a possible residual error in telescope pointing because the overlays of the 31  ghz and far - ir images in fig .",
    "[ fig : templates ] show a good match , and would not improve by shifting on 0.5  arcmin scales .",
    "if dust is reponsible for the 31  ghz emission in ldn  1622 then a tight relationship is expected with the mid- and far - ir emission . here",
    "we investigate the consequences of assuming that the emission traced by the cbi scales linearly with the four _ iras _ maps .",
    "the infrared emission from dust is discussed in details by , e.g , @xcite .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "100@xmath1 m band traces emission from large grains , with sizes greater than 0.01  @xmath1 m .",
    "the large grains are in equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field , with a temperature of order 1020  k depending on environment .",
    "continuum emission at shorter wavelengths is due to hot dust , at @xmath4100  k , which is too hot to be maintained in equilibrium with the interstellar uv field .",
    "mid - ir emission from classical hot dust is not expected because of the absence of a strong uv source within ldn  1622 , in contrast with compact hii regions or planetary nebulae .",
    "thus stochastic heating of vsgs dominates the dust emission in the _ iras _",
    "12@xmath1 m and 25  @xmath1 m bands .",
    "the heat capacity of a vsg is so small that the absorption of a single uv photon increases the particle temperature high enough for it to emit at @xmath44 m .",
    "thus , by examing the degree of correlation with the 4 _ iras _ bands , we hope to determine which type of grain , whether the large grains or the vsgs , are responsible for the 31  ghz emission .",
    "we caution that from the _ iras _ photometry alone we can not differentiate a 31  ghz link to the vsgs from a link to a hot molecular phase that shines in the h@xmath6 lines .",
    "after all the vsgs can also be regarded as large molecules , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "another important source of flux in the _ iras _",
    "12@xmath1 m and 25@xmath1 m bands are the h@xmath6 ro - vibrational lines , such as h@xmath6(00)s(2 )  12.3@xmath1 m , and h@xmath6(00)s(0 )  28.2@xmath1 m .",

    "we quantify this qualitative result , and show it is not affected by noise or missing spatial frequencies at 31  ghz .",
    "is the cm - wave  mid - ir correlation detectable directly in the visibility data ?",
    "the cross - correlations may be different in the image plane and in the @xmath14 plane because of two reasons .",
    "one is the contribution of point sources at 12  @xmath1 m , which are absent at 31  ghz .",
    "the fainter point sources at 12  @xmath1 m may be numerous and act as diffuse emissionm image of ldn  1622 in fig .",
    "[ fig : isocam ] ] .",
    "the subtraction of the brightest point sources may not be accurate enough to retain genuinely diffuse emission at 12  @xmath1 m .",
    "another difficulty with a @xmath14-plane analysis of the diffuse emission are the uncertainties in the cbi primary beam ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .  1 ) .",
    "variations between antennas introduce uncertainties beyond about 40  arcmin from the phase center .",
    "ldn  1622 is surrounded by diffuse emission , such as that traced by _ iras_. the outskirts of barnard s loop are within 35  arcmin from the phase center , and it peaks at about 60  arcmin . also in the neighborhood of ldn  1622 is the reflection nebula ngc  2067 , which at 1.9 - 2.7  deg from the phase center falls on a sidelobe of the primary beam at 2.2  deg .",
    "barnard s loop or ngc  2067 are bound to enter the side lobes and low level wings of the primary beam , where the uncertainties in the primary beam model used in cbi - simulated visibilities become important .",

    "we restrict the analysis of the non - differenced dataset to @xmath14-radii above 120  @xmath16 .",
    "such a baseline range allows minimizing ground spill over or moon contamination .",
    "another reason for restricting baseline lengths above a minimum is that a constant background in the template maps affects the simulated visibilities for the shortest baselines .",
    "we minimize this effect , which is due to the restricted sky domain available to compute the simulated visibilities , by clipping the templates so that their minimum intensity value is zero .",

    "the significance of the results is difficult to assess because the noise in the comparison maps is not known accurately ( and is neglected in this analysis ) , and the confidence level associated to the @xmath45 distribution with @xmath58 degrees of freedom is extremely sharp at @xmath59 .",
    "a drawback of analysing the visibility data directly in the fourier - plane is that the effect of the point sources is difficult to isolate , especially at shorter ir wavelengths , where point sources are more frequent .",

    "we explain the shift in the position of the northen peak as being due to a young stellar object ( yso ) , namely l1622 - 10 , whose emission contributes at 12  @xmath1 m but not at 31  ghz .",
    "thus the 31  ghz emission is genuinely diffuse , while 12  @xmath1 m includes photospheric emission , or unresolved very hot dust .",

    "[ fig : isocam ] an overlay of the _ iras _  12@xmath1 m emission in contours on the upright isocam 6.7  @xmath1 m map .",
    "the 12  @xmath1 m peak and the saturated region at 6.7  @xmath1 m are coincident .",
    "l1622 - 10 is probably a t - tauri binary @xcite .",
    "we extracted the b , r , and i , photometry of l1622 - 10 from the usno - b10 catalog @xcite , and constructed the sed shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : ysosed ] .",
    "an estimate of the iso flux is included at 6.7  @xmath1 m , but is assigned zero weights because the presence of pixel glitches spreading away from l1622 - 10 suggests the detector may be saturated .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "25  @xmath1 m flux is also assigned zero weight because of uncertainties in the nebular contamination .",
    "a simple blackbody fit gives a temperature of 1680@xmath3050  k , using conservative uncertainties on the data points , and a linear size of 0.2@xmath300.01  au for a distance of 120  pc .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the blackbody fit is thus 2.8  l@xmath158 , corresponding to a 1.4  m@xmath158 main - sequence star , which confirms that the yso is a low - mass object .",

    "<S> the spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud ldn  1622 , as measured by finkbeiner using _ wmap _ data , drops above 30  ghz and is suggestive of a boltzmann cutoff in grain rotation frequencies , characteristic of spinning dust emission .    </S>",
    "<S> ldn  1622 is conspicuous in the 31  ghz image we obtained with the cosmic background imager , which is the first cm - wave resolved image of a dark cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the 31  ghz emission follows the emission traced by the four _ iras _ bands . </S>",
    "<S> the normalised cross - correlation of the 31  ghz image with the _ iras _ images is higher by 6.6  @xmath0 for the 12  @xmath1 m and 25  @xmath1 m bands than for the 60  @xmath1 m and 100  @xmath1 m bands : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mid - ir  cm - wave correlation in ldn  1622 is evidence for very small grain ( vsg ) or continuum emission at 2636  ghz from a hot molecular phase . in dark clouds and their photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) </S>",
    "<S> the 12  @xmath1 m and 25  @xmath1 m emission is attributed to stochastic heating of the vsgs . </S>",
    "<S> the mid - ir and cm - wave dust emissions arise in a limb - brightened shell coincident with the pdr of ldn  1622 , where the incident uv radiation from the ori  ob  1b association heats and charges the grains , as required for spinning dust . </S>"
