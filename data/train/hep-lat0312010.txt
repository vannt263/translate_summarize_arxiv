    "anisotropic lattices realize small temporal lattice spacings while keeping modest computational costs . the technique is useful in various fields of lattice qcd",
    "simulation : at finite temperature the large number of degrees of freedom in euclidean time direction leads large number of matsubara frequencies , which is efficient for calculation of the equation of state @xcite and for analyses of temporal correlation functions @xcite . the large temporal cutoff is important for relativistic formulations of heavy quarks on lattices @xcite .",
    "it is also convenient for the correlators in which noises quickly grow as time such as glueballs @xcite and negative parity baryons @xcite .",
    "however , uncertainties of anisotropy parameters bring additional errors into the observed quantities . for precise calculations ,",
    "we need to tune anisotropy parameters with good statistical accuracies and to control the systematic errors in the continuum extrapolations . in this work",
    "we discuss the tuning procedures of anisotropy parameters for the staggered fermions in the quenched and dynamical qcd simulations .",
    "our goal is to tune anisotropy parameters within 1% statistical errors at each set of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the following ,",
    "we focus on lattices with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath4 .",
    "in the numerical simulations , we adopt wilson gauge and staggered quark actions on anisotropic lattices .",
    "the staggered quarks have several advantages over the wilson - type quarks in studies related to the chiral symmetry and in simulations at lighter quark masses .",

    "the anisotropy parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 should be tuned so that the physical isotropy condition , @xmath12 holds at each set of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the renormalized anisotropies defined through the gauge and quark observables , respectively . in quenched simulations , one can firstly determine the @xmath2 independently of @xmath3 , and then tune @xmath3 for fixed @xmath2 . on the other hand , in dynamical simulations , @xmath2 and @xmath3 need to be tuned simultaneously .      for the calibration in the gauge sector , we define @xmath13 through the hadronic radii @xmath1 @xcite in the spatial and temporal directions . since we set the lattice scale via @xmath1 , the physical anisotropy is kept in the continuum extrapolation .",

    "we instead apply the smearing technique to the anisotropic three - dimensional planes which enables determination of @xmath19 at 1% level of accurately .      in the fermion sector",
    ", we define @xmath21 with the ratio of meson masses in temporal and spatial directions : @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we use the pseudoscalar channel , since in that channel the oscillating components of the correlators disappear quickly and hence statistical errors of masses are small .",
