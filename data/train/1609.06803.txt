    "the study of the conformal structure of spacetimes has a long tradition in general relativity , and was initiated by roger penrose s pioneering work in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "however , probably for the first time , conformal transformations were already applied in differential geometry by hermann weyl as early as 1918 @xcite .",
    "nowadays , it is well known that conformal infinity is crucial for a rigorous description of gravitational waves .",
    "most importantly , the einstein equations themselves can be reformulated in terms of quantities that characterise the conformal structure and are regular even at `` infinity '' , which leads to helmut friedrich s conformal field equations @xcite .",
    "yet another , further refined reformulation of the field equations , which avoids certain mathematical difficulties at spacelike infinity @xmath0 , is again due to friedrich : the generalised conformal field equations @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient is a novel representation of @xmath0 as a cylinder @xmath1 that connects past and future null infinity @xmath2 . in this way",
    ", the behaviour of fields near spacelike infinity can be appropriately resolved . for comprehensive overviews of conformal methods and detailed references",
    ", we refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite .    in order to understand basic properties of fields near @xmath0 , and , in particular , to study how they can be reconstructed numerically",
    ", it is most appropriate to adopt the formulation in which @xmath0 is blown up to the above - mentioned cylinder .",
    "however , instead of solving the rather complicated full system of the ( generalised ) conformal field equations , we consider the conformally invariant wave equation @xmath3 for a scalar function @xmath4 as a toy model , where @xmath5 is a fixed metric and @xmath6 the corresponding scalar curvature . while this equation is much simpler , it has the same structure of characteristics , and it is assumed to already mirror important features and potential numerical difficulties of the full problem . in the case of a minkowski background , and under the assumption of spherical symmetry ,",
    "this problem was successfully solved in @xcite with a fully pseudospectral scheme , which means that spectral expansions are used with respect to space _ and _ time .",
    "the main result was that highly accurate solutions close to machine accuracy can be obtained and that one observes spectral convergence , i.e.  the error decays exponentially with the numerical resolution .    in this paper , as the next logical step , we extend these results to a less trivial spacetime",
    ": we consider a schwarzschild background . again",
    "our main interest is in an appropriate description of the behaviour near spacelike infinity .",
    "this implies , in particular , that we first have to identify suitable coordinates that are sufficiently well - behaved near the cylinder @xmath1 .",
    "while regular initial data in the minkowski case have a regular time development , we will observe that certain logarithmic singularities are generally present for a schwarzschild background .",
    "hence it is important to study what impact this has on our numerical considerations .",
    "we will solve the schwarzschild wave equation with the same fully pseudospectral method that we also used in the minkowski case .",
    "this scheme is based on marcus ansorg s approach to solving elliptic problems with pseudospectral methods @xcite , and it was first generalised to time - evolution problems in @xcite . for a number of further applications of this method , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we will not go into numerical details in this paper , since the method is extensively discussed in the previous references .",
    "however , we briefly summarise the main idea of the method , which consists in the following steps :    1 .",
    "we map the physical domain to one ( or several ) unit square(s ) by introducing spectral coordinates @xmath7\\times[0,1]$ ] such that the surface on which initial data are given corresponds to @xmath8 . for the present application ,",
    "one unit square turns out to be sufficient .",
    "we enforce the initial conditions by expressing the unknown function @xmath9 in terms of another unknown @xmath10 via @xmath11 .",
    "we choose spectral resolutions @xmath12 and @xmath13 in spatial and temporal directions and approximate the new unknown @xmath14 in terms of chebyshev polynomials @xmath15 in the form @xmath16 4 .",
    "we obtain an algebraic system of equations by requiring that the relevant differential equations ( and boundary or regularity conditions , where applicable ) are satisfied at a set of collocation points . for our purposes ,",
    "a suitable choice are gauss - lobatto nodes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , defined by @xmath20 these have the advantage that gridpoints lie at all four boundaries @xmath21 .",
    "starting from some initial guess , we solve this system iteratively with the newton - raphson method . in the present case of a _ linear _ wave equation",
    ", we can simply choose the trivial solution @xmath22 .",
    "for nonlinear equations , however , one usually needs to provide an initial guess sufficiently close to the solution , in order to guarantee convergence .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nearinf ] , we introduce coordinates that are suitable for a discussion of the wave equation near spacelike infinity . in these coordinates , we first reconstruct a simple test solution numerically , which is regular everywhere .",
    "then we show that general solutions suffer from logarithmic singularities at the intersection of @xmath1 and @xmath23 .",
    "we also show that the development of initial data that are chosen subject to certain regularity conditions avoids the leading - order singularities , and we study how the logarithmic terms at different orders influence the numerical accuracy .",
    "afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec : horizon ] , we include the event horizon into the numerical domain . to this end",
    ", we show how a coordinate singularity of the previous coordinates , which prevents access to the horizon , can be removed , and we numerically solve the wave equation in the modified coordinates . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we summarise and discuss our results .",
    "in order to investigate and numerically solve the conformally invariant wave equation near spacelike infinity , we first need to choose suitable coordinates that are sufficiently well - behaved in the sense that they allow us to construct accurate numerical solutions . ideally , one could envision coordinates that cover the entire exterior of the black hole  and probably even further regions of the maximally extended schwarzschild solution .",
    "the well - known standard compactification and its variations simply shrink the kruskal - szekeres coordinates by mapping the corresponding null coordinates to a finite domain , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the resulting metrics , however , are typically not conformally related to another metric with desirable geometric properties , in particular near infinity , and at least some degree of regularity of the metric will be lost at the conformal boundary . a promising new family of coordinate systems that achieves an analytic conformal compactification has been constructed in @xcite with particular view on suitability for numerical computations . while @xmath0 is still treated as a point in these coordinates , it is possible to blow it up to the cylinder @xmath1 with an additional coordinate transformation . unfortunately , even though these coordinates behave better near null infinity ( as shown in a direct comparison with standard compactifications in @xcite ) , they turn out not to be optimal for our treatment of spacelike infinity .",
    "the problem is that the metric contains terms that behave like @xmath24 near the cylinder , which is assumed to be located at @xmath25 .",
    "this is only a weak logarithmic singularity with bounded function values and derivatives , but second derivatives blow up as @xmath26",
    ". since spectral methods are very sensitive to this type of irregularity , these coordinates are not a good choice for our purposes . as a consequence",
    ", we have to be satisfied with choosing other coordinates that cover only a certain portion of the exterior vacuum region , but are suitable for our numerical computations .",
    "however , since our main interest lies in the behaviour near the cylinder , this appears to be an acceptable restriction .",
    "we first consider coordinates that were introduced by friedrich @xcite . these are adapted to one family of radial null geodesics ( instead of both families , as in the kruskal - szekeres",
    "coordinates ) , and a conformal metric is chosen according to the conformal cn - gauge .",
    "starting from the schwarzschild metric @xmath27 in isotropic coordinates @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 , we compactify the radial coordinate @xmath31 and rescale the time coordinate @xmath32 by setting @xmath33 with the additional transformation @xmath34 we finally arrive at coordinates @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is a null coordinate and in which spacelike infinity is blown up .",
    "note that the integral in the above coordinate transformation can be evaluated to give @xmath37 but this explicit form is not needed in the following .",
    "the metric can now be written as @xmath38 in terms of the conformal metric @xmath39{\\mathrm{d}}\\rho^2-{\\mathrm{d}}\\sigma^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and with the conformal factor @xmath41 we consider the new coordinates in the intervals @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath36 to values below a maximum @xmath44 is necessary , because the transformation eq : trans2 introduces a coordinate singularity at @xmath45 , due to @xmath46 .",
    "this is also clear from the explicit relation eq : texplicit . as a consequence , the conformal metric eq : conmet is singular at @xmath45 , where @xmath47 diverges , see eq : defa .",
    "since the event horizon of the schwarzschild black hole is located at @xmath48 , corresponding to @xmath49 , i.e.  @xmath50 , the region that can be described with these coordinates does not extend to the horizon . instead",
    ", the coordinates cover a domain as indicated in the standard penrose diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : confdiag ] .",
    "the cylinder is located at the boundary @xmath51 , and ( a part of ) @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "the exact location of the left boundary of the triangular region in fig .",
    "[ fig : confdiag ] depends on the choice of @xmath44 .",
    "this boundary , like all curves @xmath53 , is an outgoing null geodesic and a characteristic of the corresponding wave equation .",
    "hence no information can enter our domain through this boundary , so that no boundary conditions are required there .",
    "this is particularly convenient for our numerical computations as we avoid to impose `` artificial boundary conditions '' , as is done so often in numerical simulations , even though this is physically rather inappropriate , since usually no information about the unknown functions is available at such boundaries that would justify to impose any particular conditions there .     and",
    "[ fig : confdiag],width=453 ]    in order to formulate the conformally invariant wave equation eq : cwe , we first compute the ricci scalar in these coordinates , which turns out to be @xmath55 . with this",
    "we obtain the wave equation for a function @xmath56 , @xmath57\\,f_{,\\tau\\tau } + 2\\rho\\ , f_{,\\tau\\rho}-2\\left[1-\\frac{\\rho(1 - 2r)}{r(1-r^2)}a\\right]f_{,\\tau}+\\frac{4\\rho^2a}{r(1+r)^2}\\,f=0.\\ ] ] if we consider this equation in the limit @xmath58 , i.e.  at the cylinder , then it reduces to the intrinsic equation @xmath59 .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath60 for some integration constant @xmath61 .",
    "hence the solution @xmath4 generally diverges at @xmath62 ) , i.e.  at the intersection of @xmath1 and @xmath23 , unless we choose initial data with @xmath63 for which @xmath64 follows .",
    "this is exactly the same situation as for the conformally invariant wave equation on a minkowski background @xcite .",
    "as in the minkowski case , we will exclusively consider initial data subject to this regularity condition .",
    "note , however , that we will later observe an interesting difference to the situation with a minkowski background : while initial data subject to this regularity condition guarantee a regular solution in the minkowski case , the solutions to the schwarzschild wave equation generally still contain higher - order logarithmic singularities at @xmath65",
    ". this will be revealed by a more detailed study of the behaviour of @xmath4 near the cylinder in sec .",
    "[ sec : expansion ] below .    for our choice of initial data subject to eq : incon , the solution @xmath4 satisfies @xmath66 on the entire cylinder @xmath51 .",
    "hence we can use this equation as a boundary condition there .",
    "is a characteristic surface .",
    "consequently , boundary conditions are not required at @xmath1 and we could impose the wave equation itself .",
    "however , since the wave equation reduces to an intrinsic equation there , which , for our choice of initial data , is equivalent to @xmath66 , we can still choose to impose this condition .",
    "] however , at @xmath67 , this condition is identically satisfied for our initial data .",
    "instead , we can choose the condition @xmath68 at this particular point , which immediately follows from the other condition by differentiation .",
    "furthermore , exactly as in the minkowski case @xcite , it turns out that numerical stability requires to also choose another condition than @xmath66 at the special point @xmath51 , @xmath52 , i.e.  at @xmath65 ( provided that we decide to include @xmath23 into the numerical domain ) .",
    "this extra condition , of course , must be a consequence of the wave equation  certainly we can not choose just any condition . similarly to the minkowski situation , the extra condition is obtained by differentiating the wave equation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath36 . at @xmath51 , this gives @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath70 on the cylinder , this is an intrinsic equation for the mixed derivative @xmath71 .",
    "the solution can be expressed in terms of the values @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 hence we know the values of @xmath75 everywhere on the cylinder . at the particular point @xmath65",
    ", we can prescribe the correct value for this mixed derivative , i.e.  we can use the boundary condition @xmath76 , where @xmath72 and @xmath77 can be read off from the initial data . in summary , at @xmath51 , i.e.  at the cylinder , we impose the following boundary conditions : @xmath78    another boundary of our numerical domain is @xmath79 . as mentioned above , no boundary condition is required there as this is a characteristic of the wave equation .",
    "instead , we just impose the wave equation itself .      in order to find out whether the fully pseudospectral scheme can be applied to the schwarzschild wave equation",
    ", we first try to numerically reproduce a simple exact solution .",
    "this can be obtained by looking for time - independent solutions with respect to the original isotropic schwarzschild coordinates @xmath80 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the conformally invariant wave equation for a function @xmath81 reads @xmath82_{,\\tilde r}=0.\\ ] ] this equation can be readily integrated to obtain @xmath83 with two integration constants @xmath61 and @xmath84 . the corresponding solution @xmath4 in our compactified",
    "coordinates @xmath85 is obtained from @xmath86 via @xmath87 , since ( in four spacetime dimensions ) the conformally invariant wave equation has the conformal weight @xmath88 .",
    "hence we get @xmath89 in this form , the solution has a nontrivial dependence on the compactified time coordinate @xmath54 .    for regularity at the cylinder we have to choose @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , without loss of generality ( given that we study a linear equation ) , we can choose @xmath91 to finally obtain @xmath92 as an exact solution that is regular in the entire domain @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "now we try to reconstruct this solution from the corresponding initial data @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which can be read off from eq : testsol . in particular ,",
    "we are interested in the numerical error , which we compute as the largest absolute difference between the numerical approximation and the exact solution , @xmath97 . here",
    ", the maximum is approximated by comparing the solutions at @xmath98 equidistant points , where the numerical values are obtained via chebyshev interpolation .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : testsol ] ,    .",
    "[ fig : testsol],width=321 ]    where the error is shown for different spectral resolutions and for different choices of the coordinate range specified by the value of @xmath44 .",
    "we observe that , for each choice of @xmath44 , the error as a function of the resolution approximately follows a straight line until saturation is reached close to machine accuracy ( about 16 figures for our double - precision code ) .",
    "a straight line in a logarithmic plot corresponds to an exponentially decaying error , i.e.  to spectral convergence .",
    "this is exactly what is typically expected for ( pseudo)spectral methods , provided the solution is sufficiently well - behaved .",
    "if we compare the curves that are obtained for different values of @xmath44 , then clearly higher resolutions are required to achieve the same error for a larger @xmath44 . nevertheless ,",
    "for sufficient resolutions , the errors reach the same order of magnitude of about @xmath99 to @xmath100 , corresponding to about @xmath101 to @xmath102 significant figures in the numerical solutions . it was to be expected that a larger value of @xmath44 requires a higher resolution , since the function @xmath4 then needs to be represented on a larger domain . however , an even more important reason for the requirement of higher resolutions is that larger @xmath44 bring the numerical domain closer to the singularity of the term @xmath103 appearing in the exact solution eq : testsol .",
    "since the solution has steep gradients near the boundary @xmath79 , more chebyshev polynomials are naturally required to represent the function accurately .",
    "nevertheless , we can still reach an accuracy close to machine accuracy for just a moderate number of collocation points , even if the domain is relatively close to the coordinate singularity at @xmath45 . note that we could even further improve the numerical performance by appropriately stretching our coordinates in a vicinity of @xmath45 , which effectively places more collocation points near the boundary .",
    "this is described in detail in @xcite . for our purposes , however , this is not really necessary .",
    "firstly , we are mainly interested in a vicinity of spacelike infinity , so there is no need to choose @xmath44 very close to @xmath104 .",
    "secondly , the singularity at @xmath45 is a coordinate singularity without any physical meaning .",
    "later we will modify our coordinates in order to remove that singularity , and hence there is no reason to study the wave equation close to a singularity that can be removed .    in summary",
    ", we find that we can solve the conformally invariant wave equations with the fully pseudospectral scheme .",
    "we observe spectral convergence and obtain highly accurate solutions close to machine accuracy .",
    "this is possible since our test solution eq : testsol is well - behaved in the entire numerical domain . in the next subsection , however , we will see that general solutions usually develop logarithmic singularities at the point @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , our exact solution eq : testsol and multiples of it may well be the only solutions without such singularities .",
    "hence it is important to understand the general behaviour of solutions near @xmath0 and to test to what extent the numerical method works in those cases .",
    "next we consider the case of general initial data at @xmath8 , which usually give rise to solutions that are less regular than our explicit example solution eq : testsol .    in order to analyse the behaviour near the cylinder , we expand the solution @xmath4 in a taylor series about @xmath51 with @xmath54-dependent coefficients , @xmath105 plugging this form of @xmath4 into the wave equation eq : cwe1 , we obtain a sequence of ordinary differential equations for the functions @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 the first four of these will be discussed and solved in the following .",
    "if we abbreviate the left hand side of eq : cwe1 with @xmath109 , so that the wave equation can be written as @xmath110 , we obtain at the cylinder , i.e.  in the limit @xmath58 , @xmath111 where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath54 .",
    "the general solution @xmath112 with integration constants @xmath113 and @xmath114 diverges at @xmath52 , which , at @xmath51 , corresponds to the point @xmath65 .",
    "however , since @xmath115 , we can achieve that the singular term vanishes , if we choose initial data with @xmath116 so that @xmath117 .",
    "this is exactly the same condition for the initial data that we discussed earlier [ cf .",
    "eq : incon ] , and which is required for bounded function values at @xmath65 .",
    "hence we can eliminate the leading - order singularity at @xmath65 with an appropriate choice of initial data . unlike the corresponding minkowski case , where this was the only singular term at @xmath65",
    ", we will find weaker logarithmic singularities also at higher orders in the schwarzschild case .    assuming that initial data with @xmath117 have been chosen , we next examine the equation for @xmath107 .",
    "this is obtained from @xmath118 which has the general solution @xmath119 since this function is regular for all @xmath94 , no further singularities are introduced at this order .. if we want to consider the solution on a larger time interval that includes @xmath120 , then further restrictions need to be imposed on the initial data in order to remove singularities .",
    "for example , initial data with @xmath121 lead to a solution with regular @xmath107 , since the @xmath122-term in eq : phi1 then disappears . in the following ,",
    "however , we will restrict ourselves to domains with @xmath123 . ]",
    "once @xmath107 is chosen as in eq : phi1 , the next equation becomes @xmath124 the general solution to this equation again contains a logarithmic term , @xmath125}{3(1+\\tau)^2}\\\\   \\fl   & = & 4(2c_0-c_3)\\left(\\frac{1-\\tau}{1+\\tau}\\right)^2\\ln(1-\\tau )        + \\textrm{regular terms}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the singular term is proportional to @xmath126 , i.e.  @xmath127 and @xmath128 are bounded , but @xmath129 diverges as @xmath130 .",
    "this corresponds to a divergence of the fourth derivative @xmath131 at @xmath65 .",
    "however , it is again possible to choose suitable initial data for which this term does not appear . since @xmath132",
    ", we can achieve that the coefficient @xmath133 of the singular term vanishes by choosing initial data subject to the additional regularity condition @xmath134    finally , we consider one further order , assuming that initial data are chosen such that singularities in all previous orders have been eliminated .",
    "the equation that results from @xmath135 is rather lengthy and we do not give it explicitly , but we observe that the general solution has the form @xmath136 this time we find a logarithmic term proportional to @xmath137 , which corresponds to a singularity in the sixth derivative @xmath138 .",
    "once again it is possible to choose initial data for which the coefficient of the singular term vanishes . here",
    "this can be achieved with data subject to @xmath139    these considerations illustrate that logarithmic terms are present in the solution near @xmath65 , but they can be eliminated step - by - step by choosing initial data subject to more and more regularity conditions at @xmath67 .      how do we numerically solve the conformally invariant wave equation in situations where the logarithmic singularities from the previous subsection are present ? in cases where the exact structure of a singularity is known , one can try to reformulate the problem entirely in terms of regular quantities .",
    "an example is the computation of rotating disks of dust , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the mass density of these disks behaves like a square root near the rim of the disk , so that it has unbounded derivatives .",
    "however , one can simply write the mass density as a square root times another function , where this other function turns out to be regular .",
    "hence it is possible to reformulate the field equations using this regular function , and , consequently , one can again obtain highly accurate numerical solutions .    as a second example for removing singularities , we point to the numerical construction of five - dimensional black strings with pseudospectral methods in @xcite . while the physical relevance of these configurations is rather questionable , they are certainly mathematically very interesting .",
    "it turns out that some of the unknown functions contain logarithmic terms of the form @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is one of the coordinates and @xmath142 are constants . with a coordinate transformation @xmath143 , @xmath144 ,",
    "these logarithmic terms ( and therefore the metric potentials ) become @xmath145 ( even though not analytic ) functions of the new coordinate @xmath146 , which is sufficient for highly accurate numerics .    in our case , unfortunately , both of the above regularisation procedures seem not to be applicable , as they require an exact knowledge of the structure of the singular terms .",
    "since the calculations in the previous subsection only reveal the behaviour of @xmath4 and its derivatives as @xmath65 is approached along the cylinder @xmath51 , and not along any other curve , it is not clear if @xmath4 can be written as a combination of singular terms and one or more regular functions .",
    "another difference between our situation and the above examples , where time - independent equilibrium configurations are studied , is that we have to solve a time - evolution problem .",
    "even if @xmath4 could be expressed in terms of regular functions and well - defined singular terms , we would then also need to decompose the initial data into parts that could be used as initial data for those regular functions and parts that give rise to the singular terms .",
    "since the initial data can be chosen as arbitrary , regular functions at @xmath8 , it is not clear how the individual components could be extracted .",
    "( if the above hypothesis is true , according to which the only entirely regular solutions in our domain @xmath94 and @xmath93 may be the test solution eq : testsol and its multiples , then the `` regular portion '' of the initial data may correspond to initial data for this solution .",
    "but this was only a conjecture . )",
    "hence it appears to be impossible to eliminate the logarithmic terms from our solution via coordinate transformations or reformulations of the unknown function .",
    "instead , we will try to solve the equation without reformulations and thereby test how the presence or absence of the leading - order singularities influences the numerical accuracy .",
    "however , we will only allow initial data subject to the regularity condition eq : regcon0 , for which the highest - order singularity in @xmath106 is eliminated .",
    "this ensures that at least function values , even though not derivatives , are bounded .    in the following , we choose @xmath147 and consider the family of initial data given by @xmath148 which depends on two parameters",
    "these parameters allow us to control which of the leading - order singularities will be present in the evolution of these data .",
    "since @xmath150 holds for all values of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , the leading singularity in @xmath106 is removed  as required .",
    "we also obtain @xmath153 .",
    "hence the parameter @xmath151 controls the next - order logarithmic singularity in @xmath127 , cf .",
    "eq : regcon2 : for @xmath154 there is no singularity in @xmath127 , whereas @xmath127 diverges at @xmath52 for @xmath155 . in the latter case ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath151 determines how large the coefficient of the logarithmic term is , i.e.  how `` strong '' the singularity is .",
    "finally , this family of initial data satisfies @xmath156 . comparing with eq : regcon3 , we see that we can eliminate the next - order logarithmic singularity by choosing @xmath157 .",
    "numerical experiments show that the fully - pseudospectral scheme also converges in these cases .",
    "note that , in order to determine the accuracy of the resulting solutions , we have to find a different measure than before , since no exact solution is available for these examples . to this end",
    ", we compare the function value @xmath158 as obtained for some resolution with the corresponding value obtained for the highest resolution that we choose as @xmath159 .",
    "since our numerical method effectively couples all gridpoints , any small error at one point usually spoils the accuracy at all other points .",
    "hence the investigation of the behaviour at just one point is already a good measure for the overall accuracy .",
    "are given in form of the initial values , while the values at @xmath51 are constant for our boundary condition @xmath160 , so that @xmath4 is effectively known at @xmath51 as well .",
    "this explains our choice of the point @xmath161 , which ensures that we look at function values as far away as possible from the region where @xmath4 is trivially known .",
    "] it turns out that the curves in the resulting convergence plot are not straight lines as in the case of the above test solution , if we choose a logarithmic scale as in fig .",
    "[ fig : testsol ] .",
    "however , if we use a log - log plot instead , we again ( roughly ) obtain straight lines .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .     and @xmath152 .",
    "note the double - logarithmic scale.[fig : alpha],width=321 ]    based on this observation , we conclude that the error does not decay exponentially , but proportional to a ( negative ) power of the resolution , i.e.  we have _ algebraic convergence _ rather than the previous spectral convergence .",
    "this is exactly what one expects for pseudospectral methods if the solution is only @xmath162 with some finite @xmath163 rather than @xmath145 or analytic @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we have a closer look at the examples illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "first we consider the case @xmath164 and choose several non - zero values for @xmath151 .",
    "the results can then be compared with the case @xmath154 .",
    "the corresponding curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] clearly show that the singularity in @xmath127 has a strong influence on the numerical accuracy . without that singularity ( i.e.  for @xmath154 )",
    ", the final error is below @xmath99 .",
    "however , even for the small value @xmath165 , the final error is already about two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "if we further increase @xmath151 , then the singularity becomes stronger and the accuracy is further reduced .",
    "finally , we consider the case @xmath166 , in which the next logarithmic term , namely the singularity in @xmath167 , is removed as well .",
    "compared to the simulations with @xmath154 , @xmath164 , we gain about one further order of accuracy , and the error for the largest considered resolution is around @xmath100 .",
    "this improvement is smaller than the one achieved by going from @xmath165 to @xmath154 ( in the case @xmath164 ) .",
    "hence we conclude that the singularity in @xmath167 is already of sufficiently high order to have only a relatively small influence on the result . nevertheless , the convergence curve corresponding to @xmath166 is also a straight line in the log - log plot , which illustrates that the pseudospectral methods still clearly notice the fact that the solution has a limited regularity .    in summary , we see that the numerical accuracy very much depends on our choice of initial data .",
    "if we want highly accurate results , we can restrict ourselves to data satisfying the first two , or even the first three regularity conditions ( rather than only the first ) , thus leaving logarithmic singularities only at high orders .",
    "nevertheless , even for our most inaccurate example ( obtained for @xmath168 , @xmath164 ) , the final error of about @xmath169 is still better than what some other numerical methods typically achieve . we could also just choose a larger spectral resolution , which would further reduce the error , but this would somehow be against the spirit of pseudospectral methods , where one wants to obtain very good results for a moderate number of gridpoints",
    "finally , we want to verify that the observed algebraic convergence for the solutions with the above initial data eq : iniseq is indeed caused by the logarithmic singularities at @xmath23 and does not result from some other unpleasant feature of the particular solutions . for that purpose , we solve the same initial value problems from fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] again , but this time on the smaller domain @xmath93 , @xmath170 , which does not contain the upper boundary @xmath52 .",

    "[ fig : alphataumax ] , where the errors approximately follow straight lines in a logarithmic plot ( rather than the previously used double - logarithmic scale ) .",
    "moreover , the convergence curves for the different parameter choices overlap , and we find comparable errors for all examples .",
    "saturation with final errors of about @xmath171 close to machine - accuracy is reached with between @xmath172 and @xmath173 gridpoints in spatial and time directions .    , but this time on the smaller time interval @xmath174.[fig : alphataumax],width=321 ]    this shows that we can restore all the nice features that pseudospectral methods usually have , if we exclude the logarithmic singularities from our computational domain .",
    "in the previous discussion our attention was focused on an accurate description of the cylinder at spacelike infinity and on solving the conformally invariant wave equation in a neighbourhood of this cylinder .",
    "however , we have already seen that our coordinates do not allow us to include the event horizon into our considerations , due to the coordinate singularity at @xmath45 , which prevents access from the horizon at @xmath49 ( which is formally located at @xmath175 ) .",
    "this singularity is introduced with the coordinate transformation eq : trans2 , since , for points close to the horizon , we have @xmath176 and @xmath177 , such that the integration interval @xmath178 in eq : trans2 then contains the point @xmath179 at which @xmath180 is singular . in the following we will  in several steps  construct alternative coordinates which are suitable for solving the wave equation in a domain that contains both the cylinder and the event horizon .    in a first step",
    ", we can try to modify the transformation equation @xmath181 .",
    "this part of the coordinate transformation achieves the blow up of @xmath0 , and the important point is that both @xmath51 ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath23 ) correspond to @xmath182 , i.e.  to an infinite value of the radial isotropic schwarzschild coordinate @xmath183 , cf .",
    "eq : trans1 .",
    "a modified transformation equation should still have this property , but at the same time avoid that @xmath36-values greater than @xmath104 are required .",
    "this could be achieved by replacing eq : trans2 with the following transformation , @xmath184 with the new formula for @xmath185 , the boundaries @xmath51 and @xmath52 still correspond to @xmath182 , but @xmath45 does now imply @xmath49 . hence the resulting coordinates cover the horizon , which will be located at @xmath45 .",
    "it is easy to check that the corresponding metric is regular for @xmath186 , but not invertible at the horizon @xmath45 .",

    "based on this observation , we introduce a new time coordinate @xmath192 via @xmath193 if we only do this coordinate change , then geodesics in the resulting coordinate system would no longer be accumulated at a single point , but they would have an infinite slope at the horizon .",

    "similarly , one could repeat the entire earlier discussion of logarithmic singularities at higher orders and impose further conditions to avoid these . however , here it is better to choose a numerical domain that does not contain @xmath23 .",
    "the reason is that , in the current setting with a domain that includes the event horizon @xmath207 , we do not only have to cope with logarithmic singularities at @xmath65 ( @xmath51 , @xmath8 ) , but also with a physical singularity at future timelike infinity @xmath215 ( @xmath187 ) .",

    "to this end , we restrict the coordinates to a rectangular domain of the form @xmath216 with this choice , we obtain the solution in a region that contains both the cylinder @xmath0 ( at @xmath51 ) and the horizon @xmath207 ( at @xmath51 ) , but not @xmath23 ( at @xmath52 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the logarithmic singularities at @xmath65 are not relevant for our discussion as this point is excluded from our domain too .",

    "[ fig : alphataumax ] . )",
    "the singularity at @xmath215 , on the other hand , could be strong enough to influence the numerical accuracy if @xmath217 is too close to @xmath104 .",
    "hence we will need to investigate what values of @xmath217 lead to acceptable results .",
    "besides @xmath0 , the wave equation also becomes an intrinsic equation on the horizon .",
    "this equation can be integrated to show that the following linear combination of first - order derivatives is constant on the horizon , @xmath218f_{,\\tau}-2(1+d)f_{,\\rho}=\\mathrm{constant}.\\ ] ] for our numerical purposes , however , this is not important , as we just impose the wave equation itself at @xmath45 ( which is a characteristic boundary , so that no additional conditions are required there ) .",
    "we intend to test how accurately the conformally invariant wave equation can be solved with the fully pseudospectral method .",
    "note that in our new coordinates , we can not try to reconstruct the test solution eq : testsol , as this diverges at the horizon , i.e.  for @xmath219 , and for which even initial data at @xmath8 would be irregular .",
    "instead we have to choose some regular initial data .",
    "as an example , consider the following data , @xmath220 which satisfy the regularity condition eq : newreg . in order to test",
    "how close we can come to the singularity at @xmath52 , we solve the corresponding initial value problem on different domains , obtained by choosing different values for @xmath217 . to measure the numerical accuracy , we compare the function values @xmath221 as obtained for various spectral resolutions to the value obtained for the highest resolution of @xmath222 .",

    "the errors in all these examples are comparable , i.e.  the particular value of @xmath217 has no big influence on the accuracy as long as the numerical domain is sufficiently far away from @xmath215 . for @xmath225 , however , there is a considerable loss of accuracy , compared to the previous examples : the error is about two orders of magnitude larger",
    ". nevertheless , the smallest error as obtained for the highest resolution is below @xmath99 , so that we still have very accurate results .",
    "with further increasing @xmath217 to @xmath226 we loose two further orders of magnitude , and for @xmath227 the final error is as large as @xmath228 .",
    "this shows that , as expected , our numerical scheme depends quite sensitively on the proximity to the singularity",
    ". however , unless we are really close to @xmath52 , very accurate solutions are found .",
    "we have studied the conformally invariant wave equation on a schwarzschild spacetime with particular consideration of an appropriate treatment of spacelike infinity @xmath0 as a cylinder @xmath1 .",
    "this problem can be regarded as a toy model for the general behaviour of more complicated equations ( e.g. , the spin-2 system or the full einstein equations ) and their solutions near the cylinder . in particular , our present studies extend the previous discussions of the minkowski wave equation in @xcite to a nontrivial background metric .",
    "we found that we can numerically solve the schwarzschild wave equation with the fully pseudospectral scheme that we also used in the minkowski case .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently regular solutions , we observe the same numerical properties : we achieve highly accurate solutions close to machine accuracy with a moderate number of gridpoints , and the error decreases exponentially with the spectral resolution , i.e.  we have spectral convergence .",
    "however , as opposed to the minkowski case , the solutions are generally not regular if future null infinity @xmath23 is part of the numerical domain .",
    "indeed , in the present schwarzschild case , the solutions generally develop logarithmic singularities at the intersection of @xmath1 and @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "the numerical convergence is only algebraic in those cases .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical approximations turn out to be still very accurate .",
    "moreover , we have shown how one can derive regularity conditions for the initial data , which allow to read off from given data whether logarithmic terms in the first few orders will develop or not .",
    "we can even use these conditions to specifically construct initial data for which irregularities appear only at higher orders .",
    "this helps to improve the numerical performance .",
    "overall , we see that the fully pseudospectral scheme is very well - suited for treating the conformally invariant wave equation on a schwarzschild background , even in the presence of logarithmic singularities .",
