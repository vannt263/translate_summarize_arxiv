    "the standard model of electroweak interactions has now been tested thoroughly in a number of experiments .",
    "the only sector that has not been tested directly is the electro - weak symmetry breaking ( or higgs ) sector .",
    "it is very important to understand in detail the experimental signatures for the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "these vary from the direct search for new particles such as a higgs boson , to the search for indirect manifestations of the existence of these new particles .",
    "a convenient parameterization of these indirect effects of new particles at energies below threshold for their production is that of anomalous gauge boson couplings , the subject of this meeting . as discussed by wudka @xcite",
    ", there are several ways in which these anomalous gauge boson couplings may be written in terms of a low energy effective lagrangian .",
    "i choose to study the case of a strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector in which there is no light higgs boson , and therefore , use an effective lagrangian with a non - linearly realized symmetry breaking .",
    "my motivation for this choice is simple : if there is a light higgs boson we will find it directly and not through its contributions to anomalous couplings .",
    "i furthermore choose the `` gasser and leutwyler''@xcite construction of the effective lagrangian because it makes the discussion of global symmetries transparent .",
    "first i briefly review the formalism in order to establish the notation and discuss the possible size of the parity violating anomalous coupling from simple dimensional analysis .",
    "i then study the indirect bounds that can be placed on this coupling from its one - loop contribution to rare decays and partial @xmath2 widths .",
    "finally i discuss how to isolate the parity violating coupling in future high energy experiments .",
    "the starting point is the minimal standard model without a higgs boson .",
    "this model can be written as the usual standard model , but replacing the scalar sector with the effective lagrangian @xcite : @xmath3 the matrix @xmath4 , contains the would - be goldstone bosons @xmath5 that give the @xmath6 and @xmath2 their mass via the higgs mechanism .",
    "their interactions with the @xmath7 gauge bosons follow from the covariant derivative : @xmath8    the details of the physics that break electroweak symmetry determine the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian . at energies small compared to @xmath9 , it is sufficient to consider those terms that are suppressed by @xmath10 with respect to eq .",
    "there are three terms in this next to leading order effective lagrangian that contribute to gauge boson self - energies at tree level ( and thus to the lep observables @xmath11 of ref.@xcite ) . for later reference , the one the respects the custodial symmetry is @xmath12 .",
    "there are several terms in the next to leading order effective lagrangian that contribute to three gauge boson couplings at tree level .",
    "only two of them respect the custodial symmetry , for later reference they are @xmath13 , @xmath14 .    finally , there are also several terms in the next to leading order effective lagrangian that contribute at tree level to couplings with at least four gauge bosons .",
    "two of these terms respect the custodial symmetry and for later reference they are @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",

    "this term gives rise to three and four gauge boson couplings and is the subject of this talk .",
    "the motivation for considering this term is , of course , that we should explore all possibilities for the symmetry breaking sector . in theories where the electroweak symmetry breaking sector conserves parity , like the minimal standard model or most technicolor theories ,",

    "[ leffpv ] , are very simple .",
    "there is a three gauge boson interaction : @xmath25 which generates a @xmath26 coupling . in the notation of ref.@xcite",
    "we have the correspondence : @xmath27 there is also a four gauge boson interaction required by electromagnetic gauge invariance : @xmath28 this interaction contributes to the processes we discuss and must be considered simultaneously with that of eq .",

    "we see that in this limit ( in which the custodial symmetry is violated `` maximally '' ) , the parity violating coupling is of the same size as other anomalous couplings . of course",
    ", this limit is not allowed by the size of @xmath34 .",
    "taking the scale @xmath9 to be a few tev ( @xmath35  tev for definiteness ) , one expects that in theories where there is no custodial symmetry and @xmath36 accidentally , @xmath37 can be of order one . on the other hand , in theories with a custodial symmetry ,",
    "one expects @xmath37 to be at most as large as @xmath34 .",
    "our effective lagrangian formalism breaks down at some scale @xmath38  tev , and this manifests itself in amplitudes that grow with energy and violate unitarity at some scale related to @xmath9 . by studying the high energy behavior of longitudinal",
    "vector boson scattering one finds that the effective lagrangian description breaks down between 1 and 2 tev . for our numerical estimates we will work with energies up to 2 tev .",
    "we thus turn the question around and ask how large can @xmath37 be so that all scattering amplitudes remain below their unitarity bound at energies up to 2 tev .",
    "the answer is @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the bounds that can be placed at high energy experiments on this coupling will only be meaningful if they are better than @xmath39 . for bounds placed at lower energy machines such as lep ,",
    "the bad high energy behavior shows up in the need for counterterms to the one - loop calculations .",
    "since we do not know what those counterterms are , the bounds obtained will be connected to `` naturalness '' assumptions .",
    "in this section we study the bounds that already exist on @xmath1 .",
    "they follow from considering the one - loop effects of the operator eq .",
    "[ leffpv ] in the coupling of a @xmath2 boson to fermions .",
    "these observables do not single out the effects of @xmath1 , they are sensitive to most of the anomalous couplings .      these rare decays receive contributions from the parity violating effective lagrangian eq .",
    "[ leffpv ] at the one - loop level .",
    "one - loop amplitudes with one vertex from the @xmath42 effective lagrangian are @xmath43 .",
    "a complete study thus requires the next to next to leading order counterterms , as well as two loop contributions from the leading order effective lagrangian .",
    "it is clear that there are several contributions to these decays that occur at the same order as the one - loop contribution from @xmath1 and that they could cancel : we assume that they do not .    in unitary gauge",
    ", the @xmath1 coupling affects this decays by modifying the `` @xmath2-penguin '' diagram as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the result is dominated by top - quark intermediate states and is finite due to a gim cancellation . with @xmath44 and defining @xmath45 one can write down the result in terms of the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , by replacing : @xmath46 one finds for example : @xmath47 there are similar contributions to the decays @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "because @xmath48 is dominated by long distance physics , it can only be used to place a `` theoretical '' bound on @xmath1 by requiring the new contribution to be less than the standard model short distance contribution @xcite .",
    "this results in @xmath50 if the rates for the short distance dominated processes @xmath51 or @xmath49 are measured to within factors of two , the same bound eq .",
    "[ raredecay ] will be obtained . to improve this",
    "bound would require a precision measurement of the rate , combined with detailed knowledge of all the standard model parameters ( ckm angles , top quark mass , and decay constants ) @xcite .",
    "high precision measurements at the @xmath2 pole at lep combined with polarized forward backward asymmetries at slc put stringent limits on any new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "these measurements are now sufficiently precise to limit the one - loop contribution of anomalous three gauge boson couplings to the @xmath2 pole observables .",
    "the bounds arise because at the one - loop level eq .",
    "[ leffpv ] modifies the @xmath52 couplings . because the operator modifies the gauge boson self - couplings , its one - loop effects on the @xmath2 couplings to fermions affect both the flavor diagonal and the flavor changing vertices considered in the previous section .",
    "it turns out that the flavor diagonal vertices provide better constraints due to the extraordinary precision of the lep measurements .",
    "the flavor diagonal calculation is different from the flavor changing calculation in that the one - loop effects of @xmath1 are now divergent .",
    "nevertheless , from the effective field theory perspective this is not significant . in both cases ,",
    "there are other contributions to the physical processes from other non - renormalizable interactions between fermions and gauge bosons . in the previous section we adopted the point of view that those other interactions did not cancel the contributions of @xmath1 to rare decays . in this section",
    "we adopt the point of view that the renormalization of such couplings removes any divergence from physical amplitudes .",
    "as is usual in effective field theory calculations , we estimate the size of the @xmath1 contribution to the physical amplitudes from the leading non - analytic terms that go like @xmath53 .",
