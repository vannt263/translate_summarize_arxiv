    "in recent years , alkaline - earth and alkaline - earth - like atoms have attracted much research interest . with two valence electrons ,",
    "these atoms acquire interesting features such as long - lived electronically excited states and the separation of nuclear- and electronic - spin degrees of freedom in the so - called clock states .",
    "these features have been extensively investigated for proposals and applications in precision measurements  @xcite , as well as quantum information and quantum simulation  @xcite .",
    "however , it has long been considered difficult to realize a stable , strongly - interacting gas of alkaline - earth or alkaline - earth - like atoms , due to the lack of ground - state magnetic feshbach resonances .",
    "although the interactions can be tuned via optical feshbach resonances , it is only at the cost of severe atom losses  @xcite .    in this context",
    ", the recently discovered orbital feshbach resonance ( ofr ) in @xmath0yb atoms has enabled the study of strongly - interacting systems using alkaline - earth and alkaline - earth - like atoms , and thus greatly enriches the scope of quantum simulation in these systems  @xcite . like the magnetic feshbach resonances in alkaline atoms  @xcite",
    ", the ofr derives from the resonant scattering between an open channel and a closed channel . in @xmath0yb atoms for example",
    ", the open channel corresponds to two atoms occupying the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 states respectively , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) corresponds to the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) state , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent two different nuclear spin states in the hyperfine manifold of the clock states @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on the other hand , the closed channel corresponds to two atoms occupying the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 states respectively .",
    "note that since @xmath11 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the nuclear spins and the electronic spins are decoupled . as a result",
    ", the two - body interaction at short ranges can occur either in the electronic spin - singlet and nuclear spin - triplet channel @xmath12 , or in the electronic spin - triplet and nuclear spin - singlet hannel @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the short - range interactions are thus off - diagonal in the basis of open and closed channels , and couple the two channels in the form of an inter - orbital nuclear - spin - exchange interaction .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of a finite magnetic field , the differential zeeman shift between @xmath5 and @xmath6 should give rise to a tunable energy difference between the open and the closed channels  @xcite .",
    "thus , a resonant scattering can occur when a shallow bound state in the open channel is tuned to the two - body scattering threshold .",
    "the ofr is first proposed theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently confirmed experimentally using @xmath0yb atoms .",
    "further studies show that the ofr is a narrow resonance in terms of the resonance width , but a wide one in terms of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the latter makes the ofr easily accessible in @xmath0yb atoms .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of ofr is the spin - exchange nature of the two - body interaction potential .",
    "while this interesting feature has seen applications in quantum information , it would be interesting to see its effects in a many - body setting .",
    "a promising scenario to examine is the impurity problem close to an ofr . in alkaline atoms , impurity problems across the conventional magnetic feshbach resonance",
    "have been extensively studied in recent years  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical and experimental investigations provide physical insights into the underlying many - body system in the highly - polarized limit , and serve to bridge few- and many - body physics . in systems with ofr ,",
    "it is natural to expect that similar studies should offer valuable information of the system on both the few- and the many - body levels .    in this work",
    ", we consider an impurity atom in an excited state @xmath4 interacting with a fermi sea of atoms in @xmath3 of the ground - state manifold .",
    "in the presence of a finite magnetic field , the ofr mechanism leads to a tunable interaction strength between the impurity atom and atoms in the fermi sea . as a result ,",
    "the impurity atom can either induce collective particle - hole excitations out of the fermi sea , or form tightly bound molecular states , depending on the parameters .",
    "typically , this should lead to the so - called polaron to molecule transition as the interaction strength is tuned . due to the inter - orbital spin - exchange interactions of ofr , the formations of both the polaron and the molecular states feature novel spin - flipping processes .",
    "for example , an atom in the @xmath3 state and another in the @xmath4 state are scattered to the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 states . as a result , for the polaron , besides the conventional spin - conserving particle - hole excitations , one should also have spin - flipping excitations , under which previously empty hyperfine states become occupied .",
    "while in the molecular state , two - body bound state also emerges in the originally unoccupied states . adopting the chevy - like ansatz , we demonstrate that these spin - flipping processes can actually be quite important and lead to considerable weight in the corresponding variational wave functions .",
    "we then show that a polaron to molecule transition exists in the system close to the ofr , whose exact location depends on the atomic density of the system .",
    "we propose to detect the polaron to molecule transition using raman spectroscopy , by coupling population in the originally empty hyperfine states to a by - stander state .",
    "the polaron to molecule transition gives rise to a sharp signature in the ground - state raman spectra of the system .",
    "our results can be checked under current experimental conditions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : h ] , we present the formalism of the impurity problem under consideration .",

    "we consider a fermi gas of alkaline - earth ( -like ) atoms across its ofr , where the two nuclear spin states and the two orbital states combined together to form the open and the closed channels with a magnetically tunable relative energy .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are fermionic operators associated with the corresponding states with three - dimensional linear momentum @xmath22 . due to the difference of land factors in the @xmath5 and @xmath23 orbitals , the zeeman shifts @xmath15 and @xmath16 between two hyperfine states within each electronic manifold are distinct , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . as a consequence , the differential zeeman shift @xmath24 between the open channel , consisting of the @xmath14 and @xmath25 states , and the closed channel composed with the @xmath26 and @xmath27 states , can be tuned by sweeping the magnetic field .",
    "an ofr occurs as one of the closed - channel bound states moves across the open - channel threshold  @xcite .",
    "notice that by writing down eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h ] ) , we shift the single - particle dispersions such that they can be written in a symmetric form , with @xmath28 and @xmath27 at the zero - energy reference , while with @xmath29 and @xmath25 both detuned by @xmath30 .    by using the basis of electronic singlet and triplet channels @xmath31 , the interaction term takes the following form @xmath32 with the operators defined as @xmath33 the interaction strength @xmath34 are related to the corresponding @xmath35-wave scattering lengths @xmath36 via the standard renormalization relation @xmath37 with @xmath38 the atomic mass .",
    "the fermion impurity problem , by definition , is to impose a minority impurity atoms against a majority fermi sea formed by fermions of another type . in this paper , without loss of generality , we assume that the system composes of a fermi sea of @xmath39 non - interacting @xmath29 particles and an impurity @xmath40 particle , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "notice that the other configuration , with @xmath28 as the majority fermion and @xmath41 as the impurity , can be mapped to the present scenario by simply changing the sign of @xmath42 and reversing the definition of the open and the closed channels .",
    ", ( c - d ) the distribution of wave functions in the open and the closed channels , and ( e - f ) the effective masses are plotted for the shallow ( left panels ) and the deep ( right panels ) molecule branches .",
    "parameters used here are compatible with a gas of @xmath43yb atoms with a number density of @xmath44 . ]    in a molecular state , one of the majority fermions is pulled out of the fermi sea and forms a bound state with the impurity fermion , leaving the rest @xmath45 majority particles in the fermi sea .",
    "a trial wave function can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the center - of - mass momentum , and @xmath48 represents the fermi sea of @xmath45 majority particles .",
    "notice that in the expression above , the two particles constituting the molecular state can be either in the open or in the closed channel , with the corresponding coefficients @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "this ansatz has been employed in the discussion of fermion impurity problems in different dimensions close to a magnetic feshbach resonance , and is usually referred to as the bare molecular state , as all particle - hole fluctuations atop the fermi sea are neglected  @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the ansatz wave function eq .",
    "( [ eqn : molwf ] ) is then given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 the eigen energy . by substituting the ansatz wave function into the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h ] ) and matching terms , we can obtain a set of linear equations for the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 , after dropping some higher - order terms .",
    "this can also be done by evaluating the expectation value of @xmath53 , and taking derivatives with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the coefficients equations can be grouped into the following two equations @xmath54 where the parameters are defined as @xmath55 to simplify notation , we shift the energy reference @xmath56 .",
    "note that in this reference , the threshold energy @xmath57 for a non - interacting impurity @xmath58 immersed in a majority @xmath59 fermi sea with @xmath39 particles . the secular equation obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : molcoeff ] ) hence leads to a closed equation for the eigen energy of the molecular state , which takes the following form after renormalization @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "we first discuss the molecular state with a zero center - of - mass momentum @xmath62 . by numerically solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn : moleq ] ) , we find two solutions for @xmath63 : one shallow branch with energy close to the threshold energy @xmath64 , and another deeply bound state with energy @xmath65 .",
    "figures  [ fig : mol](a ) and [ fig : mol](b ) show the variations of the molecular energy shifted by the threshold energy @xmath66 as functions of @xmath42 for the shallow and the deep molecular states , respectively .",
    "notice that while the energy of the shallow state sensitively depends on @xmath42 , that of the deep state almost remains a constant .",
    "this is consistent with the physical origins of the two states .",
    "in fact , as the shallow state is intimately related to the ofr tuned by @xmath42 , the deeply bound molecular state is supported by the positive background interaction in the @xmath67 channel , and is therefore far detuned from the threshold . throughout this paper , as a typical example , we consider a gas of @xmath43yb atoms with a number density of @xmath44 unless otherwise specified , and use @xmath68 as the energy unit with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the scattering lengths are taken as @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 the bohr radius  @xcite .    by substituting the solutions of eigen energy into the coefficient equations",
    ", we can solve for the coefficients within the ansatz wave function eq .",
    "( [ eqn : molwf ] ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mol](c ) and [ fig : mol](d ) , we show the fraction of population in the open and the closed channels for the shallow and the deep states , respectively . for the shallow state , while the closed - channel fraction @xmath75 increases with @xmath42 and becomes dominant for large @xmath42 , the open - channel fraction @xmath76 follows the opposite trend .",
    "this observation can be understood by noticing that at a large positive @xmath42 , the open channel is largely detuned above the closed channel as shown in fig  [ fig : scheme ] , leading to a negligible fraction in the open channel . as a comparison , the deeply bound state is almost equally populated between the open and the closed channels , reflecting the fact that the @xmath67 state is a linear combination of the open and the closed channels with equal weights .",
    "we then turn to the general case of @xmath77 . throughout the parameter regime",
    "discussed in this paper , we find that for both the shallow and the deep branches , the states with @xmath62 remain to be the ground state . by considering a small deviation of @xmath78 away from zero",
    ", we can calculate the effective masses of the molecules . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mol](e ) , the effective mass for the shallow branch decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath42 , and approaches a limiting value of unity in the deep bec limit where the molecule is essentially a structureless particle consisting of two fermions with atomic mass @xmath79 . as a comparison , the molecular state in the deep branch remains to be a structureless boson with @xmath80 across the entire resonance regime , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mol](f ) .",
    "parameters used are the same as in fig .  [",
    "fig : mol ] ]    .",
    "the zero - momentum @xmath81 state is the ground state for large negative @xmath42 , which becomes a metastable state by passing through a first - order - like transition around @xmath82 .",
    "it eventually becomes unstable by further increasing @xmath42 .",
    "all dispersion curves are shifted with respect to their corresponding zero - momentum state energy , so that they can be compared in the same plot .",
    "the transition between two locally stable polaron states leads to discontinuous behaviors in ( b ) the energy shifted by the threshold energy @xmath83 , in ( c ) the fraction of wavefunction distribution in various channels , and in ( d ) the effective mass of the ground state polaron . in the bec limit of @xmath84 , ( e ) the closed - channel fraction as a function of @xmath85 suggests that the major contribution to the hole is close to the fermi surface , while the results of momentum distribution of the @xmath27 state ( f ) explicitly illustrates the similarity between the finite - momentum polaron and the molecular state .",
    "parameters used are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mol ] . ]    to study the polaron state of the system , we consider the following ansatz wave function @xmath86 in this expression , the first term corresponds to a bare impurity and an unperturbed fermi sea , the second term represents a state with one pair of particle - hole excitation atop the fermi sea , and the third term corresponds to the state where the majority fermion created above the fermi surface interacts with the impurity and both are scattered into the closed channel .    by writing down the schrdinger equation @xmath87 , and following the same procedure",
    "as outlined in the previous section , we obtain the closed equation for the eigen energy of the polaron @xmath88^{-1 } \\bigg\\}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 notice that the polaron energy in the expression above is also shifted by the same zero - point energy @xmath90 .",
    "we then analyze the polaron state by solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn : poleq ] ) and the corresponding coefficients equations .",
    "similar to the molecular state , the polaron state also has two solutions with a shallow branch close to the threshold and a deep branch with energy @xmath91 . as the deep branch is a direct consequence of positive background scattering length in the @xmath67 channel , and is not easily accessible experimentally , in the following discussion we focus on the shallow branch . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] , we show the the energy and the wave function distribution among different channels for the shallow state with a fixed momentum @xmath92 .",
    "a key finding is that the wave function is dominated by the bare impurity sector @xmath93 in the bcs limit with a large negative @xmath42 , while the closed - channel contribution @xmath94 prevails in the bec limit .",
    "the open - channel fraction @xmath95 remains comparable to the closed - channel fraction around resonance , and starts to drop with increasing @xmath42 as it becomes energetically less favorable .",
    "next , we discuss the general situation of @xmath77 . unlike the molecular case where the zero momentum state @xmath96 is always the ground state , the zero - momentum polaron state @xmath97 on the shallow branch is the ground state only in the bcs regime with a fairly large negative @xmath42 .",
    "the zero - momentum polaron becomes metastable , and eventually unstable with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "as one can see clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : polsq](a ) , the dispersion of the shallow polaron acquires another local minimum around @xmath98 .",
    "the competition between the two local minima hence leads to a first - order - like transition around @xmath99 for the parameters discussed here , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : polsq](b ) .",
    "the fraction of wave function distribution and the effective mass of the ground - state polaron are illustrated respectively in figs  [ fig : polsq](c ) and [ fig : polsq](d ) , both showing discontinuity at the transition point .",
    "the emergence of a finite - momentum polaron with @xmath98 can be understood by noticing that such a solution resembles the zero - momentum molecular state in the bec limit with a large positive @xmath42 . from figs .  [",
    "fig : mol](c ) and  [ fig : polsq](c ) , one can see clearly that the ground - state polaron ( molecule ) is dominated by the closed - channel population @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "for the @xmath102 state , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : molwf ] ) , the main contribution to the wave function thus corresponds to a fermi sea of @xmath103 @xmath3 atoms plus a zero center - of - mass molecule consisting of two particles in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 states , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , for the @xmath104 state , the wave function is dominated by terms with @xmath105 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : polsq](e ) .",
    "physically , this result shows that the @xmath104 state is essentially composed of a fermi sea of @xmath39 @xmath3 atoms , with a hole very closed to the fermi surface with @xmath106 , and a zero center - of - mass molecule within the closed channel .",
    "this state thus resembles the @xmath102 state and becomes energetically favorable in the bec limit .",
    "the similarity of the @xmath102 and the @xmath104 states can also be inferred from their closeness in energy in the large positive @xmath42 limit [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : transition](a ) ] , as well as from the momentum distributions of the @xmath10 level , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polsq](f ) .",
    "note that this plaron ",
    "molecule transition happens before the transition between the zero - momentum and finite - momentum polaron , so that the finite - momentum polaron state is always metastable .",
    "the number density used here is @xmath107 .",
    "( b ) the transition point @xmath108 ( black dotted ) and the corresponding energy @xmath109 ( blue solid ) vary with particle density , highlighting the lack of universality of ofr . ]    with the knowledge of molecule and polaron solutions , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition](a ) the energies for both the polaron and the molecule in the shallow branch , from which one can see clearly that there exists a polaron  molecule transition at @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath111 , the ground state of the system is a polaron with zero momentum , as one would expect for a weakly interacting fermi gas in the bcs limit . on the other hand , for @xmath112 , the molecular state with a zero center - of - mass momentum is more favorable .",
    "notice that the polaron  molecule transition point @xmath108 is smaller than the zero - momentum polaron to finite - momentum polaron transition point @xmath113 , which indicates that the finite - momentum polaron state , although could be energetically favorable against a zero - momentum polaron state in some parameter regime , remains only metastable .",
    "we stress that by considering particle - hole fluctuations in the molecular ansatz , the polaron  molecule transition would be shifted further toward the bcs limit , leading to an even larger stability region of the molecule .",
    "the variation of the polaron ",
    "molecule transition point with respect to the atomic number density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition](b ) , from which one can see that @xmath108 increases with the particle density .",

    "[ fig : mol ] . ]    in alkaline atoms , the polaron  molecule transition has been detected experimentally using radio - frequency ( r.f . )",

    "spectroscopy in which the impurity is coupled to another state in the same hyperfine manifold can be challenging , due to the particularly small land @xmath121-factor of the clock states .",

    "this is because the spectra intensity is closely related to the weight of wave functions in the closed channel , which acquires a finite jump by changing from the polaron to the molecular state .",
