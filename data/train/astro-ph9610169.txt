    "the study of clusters and groups of galaxies , which contain a noticeable fraction of the galaxies in the universe , is particularly important since they are astrophysical objects with the following properties :    * characteristical times of processes at work are in general long , with the result that clusters are witnesses of the current formation of structures in the universe ; their analysis may therefore provide constraints on cosmological models . *",
    "they contain the main components of the universe : baryonic matter ( under stellar form and x - ray emitting plasma ) and unseen matter , reaching a very high density .",
    "this explains why processes in which these components interact , observed under the generic term of environment phenomena , are numerous : morphological segregation of galaxies , hydrogen deficiencies , steep slope of the luminosity function , etc .",
    "ideally , a thorough study of a cluster should be done by using simultaneously all types of data .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a complete analysis of several clusters , both in x - rays and through optical imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "the x - ray emitting gas is a good tracer of the structure and morphology of clusters , in particular of their gravitational potential , and as such has been extensively studied , using data from satellites with increasing sensitivities , as well as better spatial and energy resolutions .",
    "however , processing methods are so different in the x - rays and optical that we will present our analysis of the cluster 85 in two papers , the present one based on x - ray data , and the second one on optical data .",
    "85 is a rich cluster of richness class 1 ( abell 1958 ) , classified as bautz - morgan type i ( leir & van den bergh 1977 ) and of rs cd type ( struble & rood 1987 ) .",
    "its optical redshift is 0.0555 , dominated by a cd ( colless , private communication ) .",
    "a spectrum of this galaxy kindly provided by colless prior to publication does not show characteristics of an active galactic nucleus , in disagreement with edge et al .",
    "previous studies have claimed the existence in the cluster of a double structure in x - rays , including a main structure and a south blob ( forman & jones 1982 , gerbal et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter gdll ) , and of a central cooling flow ( stewart et al . 1984 , prestwich et al . 1995 ) .",
    "from einstein data , gdll have derived the main physical parameters of the x - ray emitting gas , and have found in particular a very small value for the core radius of the x - ray gas ( @xmath11  kpc ) ; they have shown the temperature to be roughly constant throughout the cluster , and the dark matter to be more concentrated towards the center of the cluster than the x - ray gas .    the high spatial resolution observation of 85 with the rosat hri by prestwich et al .",
    "( 1995 ) has shown the possible existence of small bright emitting features ( of sizes 5 - 10  , or @xmath12  kpc ) which can not be identified with single galaxies and are not likely to be foreground or background sources .",
    "they argue that these blobs could be either cooler and denser than the surrounding x - ray gas , or hotter and denser gas compressed by magnetic fields .",
    "the energy range of rosat ( e@xmath132.5  kev ) is not best suited for the observation of rich clusters , since in these objects the x - ray gas has a temperature larger than 2.5  kev , and therefore spectra corresponding to different gas temperatures look very similar in the rosat energy range . however",
    ", this satellite has allowed to map clusters with unprecedented spatial resolution , and even to derive information on possible spatial variations of the temperature ( briel & henry 1994 , henry & briel 1995 ) , therefore showing that it can give useful information on clusters in spite of its energy range .",
    "> from rosat pspc data , kneer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have recently suggested that 85 is not a fully relaxed system ; they also claimed that the temperature of the x - ray gas is smaller in the center and in the south subclump than in the overall cluster .",
    "they identified this south blob with a loose group of galaxies that could be falling towards the center of the cluster .",
    "we will discuss this possibility in section  3 .",
    "we present here the results of our x - ray analysis of 85 based on rosat pspc data .",
    "spatial information is derived using a multiscale ( wavelet ) analysis , in order to extract substructure at different spatial scales ; this analysis has been improved since that presented in slezak et al .",
    "we present a pixel by pixel modelling of the x - ray gas and derive its physical properties ( temperature , density , mass ) , adapted from a previous method used to analyze einstein data . using the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis , we derive the cluster binding mass , the cooling time and cooling flow parameters , as well as the predicted temperature decrease of the microwave background by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect . the optical imaging and spectroscopic catalogues , as well as their physical interpretation will be presented in forthcoming papers by durret et al . and slezak et al .",
    "we will show that the wavelet analysis of the x - ray image , combined with a detailed physical analysis can strongly change our general vision of 85 . in section  2 , we present the data and describe the bases and behaviours of the three main techniques of analysis used here : wavelet analysis , spectral analysis and modelling of the x - ray gas . each of these methods have led to various results described in the three following sections .",
    "a critical review and discussion of these results is presented in section  6 , leading us to draw a synthetic picture of 85 , and to derive consequences on the formation and evolution of this cluster .",
    "the 85 field was observed by the rosat pspc at three separate times , dec .",
    "20 , 1991 , jun . 11 , 1992 ( sequence number wg800174p , pi r. schwarz , hereafter the german image ) and jul . 1 - 2 , 1992 ( us800250p , pi c. jones , hereafter the us image ) .",
    "the center of the pointed observations is 00h  41mn  50.4s , @xmath14  1724  for the first two images and 0h  41mn  50.4s , @xmath14  1700  for the third ( equinox j2000.0 ) .",
    "the exposure times are 15949 , 5709 and 10240 seconds respectively . in all of these observations ,",
    "the pspc - b was used and the gain was at low state .",
    "pixels were rebinned to a size of 15  , corresponding to @xmath15  kpc at the cluster distance ( taking h@xmath16=50  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 ) .",
    "we have defined the image limiting radius r@xmath18 ( 15 ) as the radius where the number of photons reaches the image background ( i.e. about 1  photon / pixel ) .",
    "the surface brightness analysis was performed in the energy range 0.5 - 2.0  kev .",
    "all the analyses were performed on the sum of the two images to minimize the uncertainties on the parameters , except for the wavelet analysis .",
    "the raw x - ray images of the abcg  85 cluster of galaxies have been processed using a multiscale vision model in order to remove the high frequency noise while keeping the small scale details linked to genuine objects .",
    "the technique relies on an iterative object - by - object restoration procedure based on the hierarchical connection trees which define the objects in a thresholded wavelet space .",
    "the basics of the algorithms involved are described in slezak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and biviano et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , while a full description can be found in ru & bijaoui ( 1996 ) .",
    "among the key points are the use of the wavelet transform to locate structures at various scales from a field labelling and the selection of objects by looking at the maximum wavelet coefficient values inside connected regions belonging to the same interscale connectivity graph .",
    "superimposed objects are then detected ( at a 3@xmath19 level ) according to their typical scale , and accurately restored from the information at both this scale and the next smaller one , providing that their wavelet amplitudes are locally high enough to generate distinct peaks in a maximum wavelet value vs. scale plot .",
    "the analysis results in a set of individual objects with different typical sizes , which are placed at their respective positions as they are restored , thereby generating the processed image . taking benefit of this additive process ,",
    "a given set of objects is easily removed from the solution , either by not taking them into account initially , or by subtracting them after the generation of the processed image .",
    "note that only resolved objects which are properly restored can be subtracted without inducing artifacts such as the `` hole '' described in section  3 , or even negative values .",
    "the linearity of the wavelet transform may however lead to misdetections for some peculiar object configurations .",
    "a bright enough feature can indeed generate at all scales wavelet coefficients much higher than those computed for an underlying larger and fainter structure .",
    "although this large component has to be considered as a distinct object , it will remain undetected when the scheme summarized above is applied .",
    "the x - ray image of a85 exhibits such a case since a very bright and unresolved peak is superimposed onto a diffuse component linked to the overall cluster . in order to detect and restore such extended background features",
    ", we decided to overcome this limitation by applying our model twice . at the end of the first step",
    "the restored objects are subtracted from the raw image and the resulting frame is searched for the objects which were missed because of the intensity of the now removed bright ones . if an object is detected , it is restored and added to the previous set of objects , thereby building the final image .",
    "note that the spectral information has been lost in this final image .",
    "the exsas package ( zimmerman et al . 1994 ) allows us to determine spectral properties of the x - ray emitting gas , for the cluster as a whole or for various parts of the cluster , with the requirement of having enough counts to perform an analysis .",
    "the use of the package is well described in the exsas manual , thus we will only discuss some behaviours of interest for our purpose .",
    "the model we use to fit the x - ray spectra is a raymond - smith plasma model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) which assumes bremsstrahlung emission and neutral hydrogen absorption , and is characterized by five parameters : the temperature , metal abundance , column density of neutral hydrogen along the line of sight @xmath20 , redshift , and a normalization factor .",
    "we have fixed the redshift to that determined optically ( z=0.0555 ) , leaving four free parameters .",
    "the background was taken in a circle of radius 6 and with its center at 31 from the center of the cluster , where there is no visible point source .",
    "the fit was done by a standard @xmath21 minimization .",
    "we have corrected the images for vignetting and dead time , and rebinned the spectrum to obtain a signal to noise ratio of 5 .",
    "we have searched for correlations between parameters in the fitting process , using the whole cluster image ( excluding the substructure south of the main body , see section  [ resultats ] ) .",
    "we find :    [ contour1 ]    i ) : :    a negative correlation between t and @xmath20 .",
    "we have    fixed the metallicity to z=0.2 ( in solar units , as assumed hereafter )    and let t and @xmath20 vary as free parameters . in    fig .",
    "[ contour1 ] we show a contour plot of confidence levels 1 , 2 , and    3@xmath19 of the @xmath21 distribution around    the central value    n@xmath22@xmath23 , t=4.5  kev .",
    "ii ) : :    no correlation between t and metallicity , when we fix    n@xmath24  @xmath23 ,    corresponding to the galactic value ( hereafter the `` canonical    value '' ) deduced from hi data ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , and let t and z    vary as free parameters .",
    "we have used the routines developed by snowden et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to determine the real exposure time , to subtract the various spurious background components , to correct for exposure , vignetting and variations of detector quantum efficiency and to merge the images . a detailed discussion of the different pspc background components can be found in snowden et al .",
    "we obtain background subtracted images in four semi - independent energy bands for the image analysis between 0.5 and 2.0  kev , chosen to have simultaneously a sufficient energy resolution and signal to noise ratio in each energy band , and to avoid strong variations of the psf with energy .",
    "the background we found is roughly @xmath25 cts / sec / pix .",
    "we develop and improve a previous model which was used to fit x - ray images taken with the einstein satellite ( gdll ) .",
    "we construct a `` synthetic '' image by assuming the x - ray emission due to thermal bremsstrahlung , using for the gaunt factor the analytical approximation of mewe et al .",
    "we assume that the cluster has elliptical symmetry , and we take an axial ratio @xmath26 and the position angle of the major axis @xmath27 as free parameters ; the `` radius '' @xmath28 we define is : @xmath29 assuming that the x and y axes are perpendicular to the line of sight , where @xmath26 is linked to the ellipticity @xmath30 by @xmath31 ) .    for the electron density , we take a modified hubble law ( @xmath32-model ) , @xmath33 including a so - called `` analytical '' king profile obtained for @xmath34 , and a modified mellier - mathez ( mellier & mathez , 1987 , hereafter mm ) law @xmath35      \\label{gammamodel}\\ ] ] the free parameters are @xmath27 and @xmath26 for the geometry , @xmath36 , @xmath32 , and @xmath37a@xmath38 for these two laws respectively .",
    "the projection of the mm law leads to the sersic law for the projected surface density @xmath39 : @xmath40 when @xmath41 and @xmath42 are related by : @xmath43 ( gerbal et al . , submitted ) .",
    "we multiply the volume - emissivity by the galactic absorption factor ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , and then convolve the model with a gaussian with fwhm equal to the energy uncertainty @xmath44 derived from the formula giving the spectral resolution : @xmath45 ( see e.g. zimmerman et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we then express the number of photons of energy e arriving on each pixel by integrating the number of counts along the line of sight , and sum over photon energies to obtain the 4 energy bands mentioned above . in order to take into account the spatial resolution of the pspc , we convolve our model with a two - dimensional gaussian of fwhm = 25",
    "this approximation is valid only near the center of the detector , where the effect of the psf on the true luminosity profile is more important .",
    "we could have taken the spatially dependent 1  kev on - axis pspc point spread function ( david et al . , 1993 ) , but because of the `` wobbling '' of rosat this method is nt more accurate .    to compare with images created with snowden s routines ,",
    "we create images of 512 @xmath46 512 pixels ( pixel size 14.947 @xmath46 14.947 ) and 256 @xmath46 256 pixels ( pixel size 29.894 @xmath46 29.894 ) to increase the signal to noise ratio and to check that our fit is pixel size independent .",
    "the best set of parameters is obtained by comparing the synthetic image to the observed one , pixel by pixel , using a maximum likelihood function to estimate this difference .",
    "we assume that the number of counts in any pixel has a poissonian distribution .",
    "the maximization of this function was performed with the minuit software from the cern library .",

    "[ coefficients ]    understanding the physical processes and dynamical situation in 85 requires a thorough analysis of these images .",
    "the two reconstructed images present the same general aspect , a main structure and a substructure south of the main body ( noted s ) , but some features differ from one image to another :    * a feature ( noted j ) on the us image is not present on the german image ; another feature ( noted b ) is seen on the german image but not on the american one .",
    "it seems therefore likely that these two substructures are artefacts in the raw data .",
    "* substructure s is clearly of complex aspect and details somewhat differ between the us and german images .",

    "1996 ) , we have shown that wavelet images on the scales of 1 or 2 pixels allowed to find x - ray emitting galaxies after superposition of optical galaxy positions .",
    "we have therefore superimposed on these images the positions of galaxies belonging to abcg  85 ( i.e. with heliocentric velocities in the interval 13300 - 20000  km / s ) .",

    "85 is a cluster reputed to have a strong central cooling flow ( prestwich et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the main argument in favour of a cooling flow in 85 is the fact that the cooling time , @xmath81 is smaller than the cluster age .",
    "we may suppose that the gas has lost a significant amount of energy in this region and that mass deposit is taking place .",

    "these equations very often present two types of steady - state solutions : yahil & ostriker ( 1973 ) gave `` outflow '' solutions , and cowie & binney ( 1977 ) proposed an accretion flow model , where the flow is regulated by radiation , in order to account for the fact that the cooling time is of the order of the age of the cluster , and for a possible central over - density .",

    "their explanations perfectly account for the high metallicity in the center of 85 ( in the cd ) . in their paper",
    "the deposit results from the transport from the multiphase medium to a cooler phase , and the ejected gas heats the surrounding medium .",
    "this may account for the central temperature ( 2.8  kev ) , which is actually smaller than the mean temperature but is not very cold ( see section  [ gv ] ) .",
    "the existence of several phases presently seems to be confirmed observationally at least in the virgo ( lieu et al .",
    "1996a ) and coma ( lieu et al .",
    "1996b ) clusters .    besides",
    ", detectors such as the ipc and mpc of the einstein observatory , or the pspc of rosat have different energy windows .",
    "if we consider the spectral analysis , results undertaken with these detectors on the x - ray gas of 85 give temperatures of @xmath1099  kev with the ipc , @xmath1096  kev for the mpc , and @xmath1094  kev for the pspc ( as indicated in section  [ gv ] ) .",
    "we can wonder if there are not gaseous phases with different temperatures ( or a range of temperatures ) that are detected by one or another of these instruments in a privileged way .",
    "however , the correspondence noticed above in section  [ gv ] between a temperature of @xmath1094  kev and the velocity dispersion ( 760  km / s ) estimated for this cluster suggests that this temperature is correct , or at least is the temperature of the dominant phase .",
    "the baryonic density of the universe is obtained from the observation of the primordial number ratio of deuterium to hydrogen .",
    "recent controversies ( rugers & hogan 1996 , schramm & turner 1996 , tytler et al .",
    "1996 ) lead to two incompatible values of @xmath111  : @xmath112 suppose for a while that clusters  in particular 85  are a fair representation of the universe .",
    "the density ratio of the baryonic component to the dynamical one in the cluster would then be equal to @xmath111 .",
    "comparing these values to the 17@xmath73 of baryonic mass in the cluster leads to  : @xmath113      these values are quite similar to those given by david et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the high value we found compared to their high limiting value is due to the ` new ' value for @xmath111 quoted above . we indicate in fig .  [ crisis ] the region of the @xmath114 and @xmath110 parameters defined by equation  [ omega ] .",
    "although the amount of baryons is high in 85 , it is nevertheless compatible with a dense universe .",
    "furthermore , clusters , and in particular 85 , are certainly not fair representations of the mean universe ; for instance we have found in 85 a galaxy luminosity function much steeper than in the field ( durret et al .",
    "but unless we favor an @xmath115 universe , the ` baryonic crisis ' ( white et al .",
    "1993 ) does not seem dramatic .",
    "we have shown in this paper that , by combining the use of an x - ray telescope with good spatial resolution , such as the pspc on rosat , with a sophisticated imaging analysis technique such as wavelets , we have gone one step further in our understanding of 85 .",
    "the rather simple image we had of this x - ray cluster , considered until recently as a main structure with a smaller one south of it , is now obsolete .",
    "the main part of the x - ray emission is due to the contribution of two clusters very distant from each other , almost on the same line of sight .",
    "the emission of the cluster abcg  85 itself appears as coming from a relaxed cluster , with a weak ellipticity . our representation therefore strongly contradicts that presented by kneer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who assume the fusion of a group ( the south blob ) with the main cluster , since we have shown that the south blob is resolved into very small features ; the principal of these features is due to an over  luminosity originating in the x - ray emitting galaxy noted bcm@xmath116 , which forms a pair with the cd .",
    "the detailed optical study of 85 undertaken by acquiring both photometry and a large number of redshifts will enable us to discuss in more detail the existence of substructure in 85 and the kinematical and dynamical properties of this cluster ( durret et al . in preparation ) .",
    "it is apparent from our results that a good understanding of clusters requires both good x - ray data and extensive redshift catalogues .",
    "obviously , new satellites such as xmm or axaf will be of great help to model in detail the physical properties of clusters in a near future .",
    "however , this analysis of 85 shows that by combining a good morphological analysis of rosat pspc images performed with wavelets and a modelling of the x - ray gas such as that presented here , it is already possible to change dramatically our view of this cluster .",
    "we therefore intend to apply these techniques to a sample of clusters observed with the rosat pspc in a near future .",
