    "since the first observation of the resonant magnetic peak in superconducting ( sc ) optimally doped yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) , @xcite the magnetic collective mode in cuprates and its role have been the subject of intensive experimental investigations , with the most direct information gained by the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) . in ybco it has been observed that with lower doping the resonant peak ( rp ) moves to lower energies , increasing at the same time in intensity.@xcite in the last years , the intriguing feature of the rp hour - glass dispersion @xcite has been in the focus .",
    "recently , also the existence of an optical ( even ) resonant mode in the bilayer ybco has been reconsidered.@xcite it has been shown that the even mode can be well identified in underdoped ( ud ) regime , however with an essentially different intensity from the dominating odd mode . on the other hand , it seems clear that the rp has to be closely related to the magnetic response in the normal ( n ) state , which has been well resolved by ins in ud cuprates .",
    "the response is typically that of an overdamped collective mode , however with an anomalous @xmath4 scaling , being common both to ud ybco @xcite and single - layer la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 @xcite cuprates .",
    "most theories , which address the rp and magnetic response in cuprates , are based on the treatment of the metallic system close to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) instability , describing the rp as a consequence of the afm ( over)damped soft mode in the n state and @xmath8 sc gap in the electron - hole excitation spectrum , leading to a sharp rp below @xmath9 .",
    "most frequently invoked is the rpa - like form for the dynamical susceptibility @xmath10 , derived in various ways or argued via the hubbard , @xmath11-@xmath12 or analogous models .",
    "@xcite the latter ascribe the rp to a weak excitonic mode below the electron - hole continuum and seem to account qualitatively for optimum doping and for the overdoped regime , in particular for the position and the peculiar downward dispersion of the rp .",
    "@xcite the alternative approach , using the memory - function ( mef ) description , recently introduced by the present authors , @xcite gives analogous results in the latter cases , and in addition a more strongly pronounced upper dispersion .",
    "@xcite    it is rather evident that the rpa - based theories for the magnetic response are less appropriate for the ud cuprates , even if taken in a broader sense as the phenomenological framework . in the first place , in the n state",
    "the usual rpa leads to @xmath0-independent and fermi - liquid - like @xmath10 , in contrast to the anomalous dynamics found by ins . @xcite",
    "as discussed furtheron in more detail , the rpa - like description can not account for a strong rp in ud cuprates and the spin - wave - like dispersion at higher energies , also observed in ins experiments .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the mef approach to @xmath13 is able to give a unified description of the anomalous n - state as well as sc - state response , even more naturally in the ud regime . in this paper",
    "we will use the mef formalism on the phenomenological level with some simplifying assumptions .",
    "it will be shown , that such an approach , generalized to a bilayer systems relevant for ybco , can account for the @xmath0 and doping evolution of @xmath10 in the ud regime , in particular for the intensity of the coherent rp , and its jump at the onset of sc in relation with its position .",
    "the framework is also used to make a quantitative comparison with ins results for ud ybco .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we briefly sketch the mef formalism ( sec .",
    "ii.a ) and then address the evolution of @xmath14 with t , including the appearance of the rp and of its intensity relative to the sum rule @xmath15 ( sec .",
    "next we present a critical comparison of the mef approach to the more commonly used rpa ( sec .",
    "ii.c ) and conclude the section with an extension of the mef approach to a bilayer system , as appropriate to ybco .",
    "in section iii we first use the available experimental data on ybco@xmath16 and ybco@xmath17 to extract the relevant parameters within mef , and then present a quantitative comparison of the mef approach to experiments .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "within the memory function formalism the dynamical spin susceptibility can be generally written as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and the spin stiffness @xmath20\\rangle $ ] can be expressed with equal - time correlations for any microscopic model of interest and is in general a quantity only weakly dependent on @xmath21 and even on hole doping @xmath22.@xcite the latter is not the case for @xmath23 or for the mode frequency @xmath24 . instead of searching for an explicit approximation for either of these quantities , we fix them via the fluctuation - dissipation sum rule , @xcite @xmath25 the underlying idea is that the equal - time spin correlations @xmath26 are much less sensitive on @xmath0 . in particular , we conjecture that they do not change ( significantly ) at the n - sc transition , which we lateron verify for available ybco data .",
    "evidently , @xmath26 is @xmath27 and doping dependent , but note that in strongly correlated systems @xmath28 is restricted by the total sum rule , @xmath29 . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate in the analysis to the commensurate @xmath30 , so the relevant quantity is @xmath31 .    here , we do not intend to give a microscopic derivation for the damping function @xmath32 , as performed within the @xmath11-@xmath12 model .",
    "@xcite still , we use the observation that the low-@xmath33 damping within the n state of a doped afm , being metallic and paramagnetic , is mainly due to the electron - hole excitations . if the fermi surface of the doped system crosses the afm zone boundary ( as revealed by arpes for most hole - doped cuprates ) , in the n state one gets @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "hence , we use as the phenomenological input in the n state the simplest approximation @xmath36 , supported also by numerical calculations within the @xmath11-@xmath12 model .",
    "the expression for @xmath37 , eq.([eq1 ] ) , in the n state then reduces to a simple damped - oscillator form .    in the sc state",
    "the d - wave gap introduces a gap also into @xmath38 . here , we are not interested in the dispersion of the rp , @xcite but rather in particular @xmath39 . hence , we assume at @xmath40 @xmath41 where the effective gap @xmath42 is given by the sc gap value at @xmath43 where the fs crosses the afm zone boundary . for the discussion of the rp the corresponding real part is essential , @xmath44 .",
    "the presented phenomenological theory has nontrivial consequences and predictions for the spin dynamics in cuprates , both for the n and thr sc state .",
    "it follows directly from eq.([eq1 ] ) that the damped - oscillator form is well adapted to treat a collective mode in the ud regime close to the afm instability . here",
    "we focus on the @xmath39 mode and take into account also the fact , that in the n state the latter is generally overdamped , requiring @xmath45 .",
    "then , we get essentially two rather distinct regimes : a ) if @xmath46 , consistent with modest @xmath47 , the n - state @xmath48 is very broad leading to a weak excitonic - like rp at @xmath49 .",
    "this is the situation corresponding to optimum - doped or overdoped cuprates .",
    "b ) when @xmath50 is close or even below @xmath51 , requiring @xmath52 , there is a pronounced low-@xmath33 response already in the n state , transforming into a strong rp in the sc phase , exhausting a substantial part of the sum rule @xmath31 .    in fig .  1 we present typical @xmath53 , corresponding to the ud regime",
    ". we fix the parameters from our knowledge of the results within the @xmath11-@xmath12 model , @xcite as relevant for cuprates . for a weakly doped afm",
    "we adopt @xmath54 ( note that @xmath55 mev ) , the value for an undoped afm . in the ud regime",
    "it is essential that the damping is small , @xmath56 , both to get reasonable low-@xmath33 response as well as underdamped spin waves at higher @xmath33 . here , we assume @xmath57 , while the sc parameters are chosen in accordance with data for ud cuprates , e.g. , @xmath58 , @xmath59 . then @xmath31 enters into @xmath48 as the only  free  parameter . in spite of simplifications ,",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "1(a ) several features consistent with experiments : a ) the mode is overdamped in the n state with a lorentzian form @xmath60 and a peak @xmath61 shifting with @xmath0 , being the signature of the anomalous @xmath4 scaling , observed in ud cuprates .",
    "@xcite b ) already at @xmath62 the peak @xmath63 is below @xmath51 , and in fact close to the position of the rp , which is not just a coincidence .",
    "c ) at @xmath40 there appears a strong rp , exhausting a large part of the sum rule @xmath31 .",
    "also it is well shifted from the effective gap , i.e. , @xmath64 is not small .",
    "the presented case is very close to the actual ins results for ybco at @xmath65 , @xcite as discussed lateron .",
    "we define the intensities as @xmath66 in fig .",
    "2 we follow the rp intensity @xmath67 , as a function of the relative rp position @xmath68 , where we vary @xmath31 and fix the other parameters . in this way",
    ", we cover the span between the weak excitonic rp ( small @xmath31 ) up to a pronounced afm soft mode ( large @xmath31 ) . in ins experiments",
    "the strength of the rp is usually presented as the difference between the sc- and n - state response , @xcite i.e. , as @xmath69 hence we plot in fig .  2 also @xmath70 , with subtracted n - state intensity at @xmath62 and @xmath48 integrated in the range @xmath71 .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "iid , such a measure can be directly compared with the recent ins experiments . @xcite",
    "as noticed elsewhere , @xcite it follows from the singular behavior of @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , that @xmath73 , valid in the regime of weak rp , @xmath74 . from fig .",
    "2 one infers that a nearly linear dependence remains valid well beyond this limit .",
    "also the rp enhancement @xmath70 shows similar dependence although overall reduced .",
    "note that in the extreme case @xmath70 can become even slightly negative .",
    "it is also worth observing that @xmath70 vs. @xmath75 is only weakly dependent on @xmath76 , which might explain why ybco with different doping @xmath77 can be plotted roughly on a unique curve.@xcite      let us also comment on the similarities and differences with the more usual rpa - like representation @xmath78^{-1 } , \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where in the sc state at @xmath79 @xmath80 with @xmath81 , whereas in the n state @xmath82 corresponds to the usual lindhard function , and @xmath83 - 4\\tilde t^\\prime\\cos(k_xa)\\cos(k_ya)-\\mu$ ] is the quasiparticle ( qp ) dispersion .",
    "the form , eq.([eq4 ] ) , has been derived in several ways or postulated based on microscopic models such as the hubbard model and the @xmath11-@xmath12 model .",
    "@xcite we treat it as a phenomenological expression where parameters @xmath84 are @xmath0 independent , while still possibly doping dependent .    in spite of the apparent different forms , rpa and mef , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , can be related at low @xmath33 .",
    "if the qp band crosses the afm zone boundary , we get in the n state @xmath85 . using the relation",
    "@xmath86 it follows @xmath87 while @xmath88_{\\omega \\to \\infty}\\propto \\tilde t$ ] .",
    "since in the sc state @xmath89 , the rpa result is also at @xmath40 formally close to our phenomenological mef approach .    nevertheless , the qualitative and even more quantitative differences become very pronounced in the ud regime approaching the undoped afm : a ) in the n state @xmath90 , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , is essentially @xmath0 independent and can not account for the n - state anomalous scaling .",
    "b ) for all reasonable qp bands , the effective @xmath76 within the rpa obtained from eq .  ( [ grpa ] )",
    "is very large , i.e. , typically @xmath91 .",
    "this prevents underdamped spin waves even at large @xmath33 .",
    "c ) the intensities @xmath67 of the rp are generally small , and in particular the n - sc difference @xmath92 .    for illustration , we present in fig .  3 characteristic results within the rpa approach in the n and sc state @xmath93 , which correspond as close as possible to the regime of mef results in fig .  1",
    "we choose the same @xmath51 , while @xmath94 .",
    "data in fig .",
    "3(a ) correspond to @xmath95 , i.e. , close to the afm instability .",
    "although the rp is quite intense in this case , exhausting @xmath96 of the sum rule , the respective @xmath97 is considerably smaller in comparison to both the mef case ( figs .",
    "1(a),2 ) and the ins data given later ( see table  [ table1 ] ) . on entering the sc state @xmath31 exhibits a drop in magnitude , which may be quite substantial for @xmath98 close to @xmath99 , again in contrast with experiments .",
    "similarly , for @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) where the rp intensity still accounts for @xmath101 of the sum rule , we get @xmath102 , one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental data .",
    "also note that @xmath70 remains negligeable ( @xmath103 ) for all @xmath104 .      in order to be able to describe more quantitatively the ins results for ybco , which is a bilayer system , we generalize the mef approach to two coupled layers .",
    "we assume that the interaction between layers is only via an isotropic exchange @xcite @xmath105 susceptibility can be defined as a matrix @xmath106 , as well as other quantities , @xmath107 etc .",
    "the plausible assumption we use here is that the dominant damping due to the electron - hole excitations can originate only from the intraplanar hopping , therefore @xmath108 .",
    "taking into account the symmetry @xmath109 etc . and defining even and odd functions , respectively , @xmath110 etc . , we can write in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath111 where @xmath112 are related @xmath113 via the sum rules as before ( eq.([eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "also , @xmath114 can be explicitly expressed for the above interplane coupling @xmath115 , and we get @xmath116    the estimates in the literature are @xmath117 , @xcite therefore to the lowest approximation we can neglect the difference , and @xmath118 .",
    "the only appreciable source of distinction between the even and odd response is therefore @xmath119 .",
    "the latter difference can become substantial in ud cuprates which are close to the afm instability , where the soft mode is @xmath120 while @xmath121 remains gapped .",
    "@xcite    with the above simplifications we can apply previous single - plane results directly to bilayer ybco . in particular , in fig .  2 results for @xmath122 vs. @xmath75 for",
    "even and odd mode should fall on the same quasi - linear curve ( for same @xmath123 ) , corresponding to different @xmath31 .",
    "e.g. , we note that @xmath124 correspond ( for @xmath125 ) to @xmath126 , respectively , being qualitatively consistent with ins experiments . @xcite",
    "let us use the existing quantitative ins data for ybco to check the relevance of the presented mef analysis .",
    "first , the spectra for ybco with @xmath129 @xcite can be used to extract directly @xmath76 .",
    "namely , at higher @xmath130  mev the spin - wave branches become underdamped and well resolved . from the width",
    "we can then estimate @xmath131  mev  @xmath132 , the value assumed in our presentation in figs .",
    "1(a),2(a ) .",
    "we notice that such low @xmath76 ( as well as spin waves ) is essentially impossible within the rpa approach .",
    "next , we extract data for the intensities @xmath133 and the sum rule @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , for ud ybco , both in the n and the sc state . to our knowledge",
    "such results are only available for @xmath134 @xcite and @xmath129 . @xcite",
    "clearly , the spectra we can only integrate in the measured window @xmath135  mev , so results the represent a lower estimate .",
    ".values extracted from ins results for ud ybco ( odd mode ) . @xmath31 and @xmath136 ) , are estimated from the data published in @xmath137  ref .  ,",
    "@xmath138  ref .  , and @xmath139  ref .  .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     overall , the fits appear quite satisfactory provided , however , that one chooses @xmath140 mev @xmath141 .",
    "essentially , @xmath142 normalizes the intensities . while theoretically ( from model calculations ) @xmath143 is a very robust quantity , there are several reasons why @xmath144 becomes renormalized .",
    "we are not dealing with the whole energy spectrum of spin fluctuations , but only with the low - frequency @xmath145 part .",
    "it is plausible , although theoretically not well explored , that there is a substantial high - frequency @xmath146 dynamics , in particular increasing with doping .",
    "this is clearly inferred from spectra obtained in numerical simulations on finite clusters for the @xmath11-@xmath12 model at finite temperature , @xcite where at low @xmath0 and low to moderate doping a rather distinctive separation of energy scales for @xmath147 and @xmath148 occurs .",
    "an enhancement of the sum rule @xmath149 with respect to the low-@xmath33 region should then occur .",
    "but @xmath142 should become enhanced even more since , being the first frequency moment of @xmath150 , it is more susceptible to high-@xmath33 tails in @xmath151 .",
    "likewise , a partial reduction of the effective fluctuating spin would also result in a smaller @xmath142 . in any case",
    ", the same question already seems to be present when interpreting the ins results for undoped afm where a reduced magnon intensity is observed through a renormalization factor @xmath152.@xcite .",
    "formally , a renormalization effect can be easily incorporated into the mef analysis by adding an effective damping above some threshold @xmath153 , assuming @xmath154 and @xmath155 where @xmath156 .",
    "such a term would renormalize @xmath142 for @xmath157 @xmath158^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] which could explain the experimentally determined @xmath159 .",
    "note , however , that a separation of energy scales as mentioned above would also lead to a similar result , since a suppression of @xmath160 in the energy interval @xmath161 is directly related to a local stepwise enhancement of damping within the same energy interval , i.e. , @xmath162 .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a phenomenological analysis of the magnetic collective mode in ud cuprates within the mef approach and have compared it with frequently used rpa in this context .",
    "both approaches give some qualitatitvely similar results for the rp , in particular @xmath73 .",
    "however , there are also clear differences . due to large damping @xmath163",
    ", the rpa can not capture the high - energy magnons , @xcite while these are easily reproduced within the mef approach . within rpa",
    "the rp intensities are too small in comparison to experiments , while @xmath164 drops at the n - sc transition , in contrast with experiments as analysed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "on the other hand , mef shows in the n state an anomalous @xmath4 scaling of @xmath165 , only being interrupted by the onset of sc , whereby the rp intensities @xmath67 close to experimental ( see table  [ table1 ] ) can be easily reproduced .",
    "however , there is significant discrepancy between @xmath166 and @xmath167 as the latter is quite small .",
    "in fact , in underdoped cuprates @xmath168 might not be as relevant a quantity for it compares the rp ( integrated ) intensity below @xmath9 with the n - state intensity just above @xmath9 , where the appearance of a pseudogap can already reduce damping @xmath76 and induce a rp - like response .",
    "@xcite    generalizing the mef approach to a bilayer system as appropriate for ybco we have shown that the rp intensities in both channels , i.e. , @xmath169 should fall on the same quasi - linear curve vs. @xmath170 , in agreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite    finally , we have performed a quantitative fit within the mef approach , which agrees well with the ins data , provided that @xmath142 at low @xmath33 is considerably renormalized .",
