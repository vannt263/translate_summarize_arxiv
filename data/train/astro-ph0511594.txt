    "* ) , and on the dark energy density . however , our understanding of observed lenses is limited by uncertainties and biases in the lens models necessary to analyze the data . despite improving data for lensed images and lens galaxies ,",
    "astrophysical applications of lensing are still hindered by poor knowledge of the environments in which strong lens systems reside .",
    "several arguments suggest that lenses have complex environments .",
    "statistical arguments based on galaxy demographics imply that at least 25% of lens galaxies lie in dense environments such as groups and clusters @xcite . from spectroscopic observations , several lenses are in fact known to lie in groups , and several others in clusters .",
    "indirect evidence for the existence of other groups comes from the large tidal shears required to explain the image configurations of many four - image ( quad ) lenses , which presumably come from mass structures near the lens galaxy or along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the range of required shears in quad lenses could reflect a range of environment densities , running from poor groups to rich clusters .",
    "comparisons of the lensing rate in different surveys have also been cited as evidence that many lens galaxies probably lie in groups @xcite .",
    "finally , theoretical models predict that lens galaxies reside in complex environments that produce substantial shears , although it is not yet clear whether the models predict shears large enough to explain real quad lenses @xcite .",
    "if not handled properly , complex environments can inject uncertainties and biases into the astrophysical quantities derived from lens models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kz04 ) .",
    "for example , neglecting environment altogether leads to lens models that , for most purposes , are simply wrong . approximating environmental effects with a simple shear term",
    "leads to models that are better but still tend to overestimate the hubble constant , the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy , and the dark energy density @xmath4 , and to underestimate the magnifications of the lensed images . in principle , modeling the full richness of environmental effects can remove these biases , and may also resolve the long - standing puzzle of why quad lenses are almost as common as doubles in statistically complete lens samples ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an analysis requires detailed knowledge of the galaxy populations , velocity dispersions , and projected spatial centroids of groups and clusters around lenses in order to determine how the environments affect the lens potentials . to date , such observations have mainly been carried out for the few lenses that reside in clusters , which leaves many lenses whose environments are known poorly or not at all .",
    "worse , existing observations can not characterize the _ distribution _ of lens environments , so we can not assess environment - related biases in statistical quantities ( such as @xmath4 or the quad / double ratio ) or ensemble properties ( such as evolution or substructure ) . while the environment distribution can be predicted from theoretical models @xcite , disagreements among the models , and discrepancies between the predicted distributions and the shears required to fit observed lenses , raise questions about the predictions .",
    "these issues have not been adequately addressed with observations , because no systematic survey of lens environments exists .",
    "surveys of a few lens fields have been published individually or in pairs .",
    "in many cases , though , those surveys only spanned a @xmath5 field around each lens , so they did not adequately sample group or cluster membership out to the virial radius ( @xmath6 mpc for groups , corresponding to @xmath7 at the redshifts of the lenses we study ) .",
    "we have undertaken a systematic deep and wide - field survey of lens fields , and here we present results for the first eight systems that we have targeted for multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "we characterize the environment within a @xmath8 diameter field around each of the eight lenses , and quantify how those environments affect the lens potentials .",
    "going beyond the lenses immediate environments , we also consider the degree to which massive structures along the line of sight to a lens affect the lens potential . the prevalence and importance of interloping structures in lens fields is poorly understood .",
    "observationally , there appear to be bound groups along the lines of sight to b0712 + 472 ( 10 members ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mg 1131 + 0456 .",
    "overdensities of galaxies are seen in the fields of several other strong lenses @xcite , but it is not yet known whether they indicate massive bound structures , and whether any such structures are associated with the lens galaxies or lie elsewhere along the lines of sight . on the theoretical side ,",
    "studies have yielded conflicting results as to whether line - of - sight structures are very important or negligible for lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show here that lenses are , in principle , sensitive to structures over a wide range of redshifts and projected spatial offsets , so the practical importance of interloping structures depends only on how common they are .",
    "our photometric / spectroscopic pencil - beam survey of lens fields enables us to self - consistently identify any prominent structures at all relevant redshifts , and to assess their actual contributions to observed lenses .",
    "separate from lensing , an important by - product of our survey is a sizable sample of poor groups at intermediate redshifts .",
    "only a few such samples are presently known @xcite .",
    "groups are important laboratories for studies of galaxy evolution because they are the most common environments for galaxies , and are also relatively simple systems in which the range of mechanisms thought to drive galaxy evolution ( primarily galaxy  galaxy interactions ) is much narrower than in hotter , denser clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zm98 ) . unfortunately , poor groups are notoriously difficult to identify using conventional methods for finding clusters , due to their low projected surface densities , faint x - ray luminosities , and inefficiency for weak lensing .",
    "the velocity dispersions of nearby groups range from @xmath9 @xmath3  for systems that are x - ray faint , late - type dominated , dynamically young , and generally similar to the local group ; to @xmath10500 @xmath3  for systems that are richer , x - ray luminous , early - type dominated , and dynamically more evolved ; up to @xmath11 @xmath3  for rich clusters . in nearby x - ray luminous groups with @xmath10500 @xmath3 , there is always a giant elliptical that lies at the center of the group potential , which suggests that such galaxies form in groups via interactions prior to being accreted by rich clusters ( zm98 ) .",

    "generally , we expect @xmath139 because of the way convergence and shear add when there is more than one perturber ( see the appendix ) .",
    "many lensing conclusions scale as @xmath140 to some power ( see kz04 and the appendix ) , which can help us estimate the biases .",
    "for example , if a lens has convergence @xmath141 , then lens models that omit the convergence will overestimate @xmath38 by @xmath7610% .",
    "hence , we consider convergences and shears larger than @xmath760.1 to be quite important , and values down to @xmath760.05 worth consideration .    in this section , we quantify the effect of the group environments in our sample by determining the convergence and shear due to the group surrounding each lens galaxy . because it is not clear how the mass is divided between the individual group members and a common group dark matter halo , we consider two extreme cases that bound the range of possibilities . in the `` group halo limit , '' we assume that all of the mass is associated with a common group halo , and we estimate the amount of mass from the velocity dispersion . in the `` group galaxies limit , '' we assume that all of the mass is bound to the individual member galaxies , and we calibrate the individual shears and convergences with recent weak lensing observations @xcite . comparing results from the two limits",
    "can indicate how much our conclusions depend on how the mass is distributed within the group .",
    "the group halo limit is appropriate for considering relaxed , dynamically evolved groups in which the individual dark matter halos of member galaxies may have been stripped by interactions , so that the dominant component is a common dark matter halo . in this case , the luminous galaxies just trace the underlying mass distribution , and the velocity dispersion of the galaxies is a measure of the mass of the group as a whole .",
    "if we model the group halo as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , then we can take the velocity dispersion @xmath36 of a group and its centroid position @xmath142 in polar coordinates centered on the lens galaxy , and compute the convergence @xmath143 and shear @xmath144 using eq .",

    "thus , if most group members are red galaxies then our current analysis may actually underestimate the convergence and shear by as much as 70% .    as a simple sanity check , in table [ galaxies.shear ] we also compute the net convergence and shear assuming that each galaxy can be treated as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with velocity dispersion @xmath194 @xmath3 .",
    "we expect that many of the galaxies have larger velocity dispersions , and given that convergence and shear scale as @xmath195 , this simple case should provide a conservative lower bound on the net convergence from the group .",

    "we expect that the conservative assumption of a small velocity dispersion more than compensates for the omission of a cut - off radius , so that the sis model results are indeed lower bounds .",

    "we find a net convergence @xmath198 and a net shear @xmath199 at position angle @xmath200 .",
    "if @xcite had done the same analysis with their catalog of four members , they would have found @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 .",
    "( @xcite would have obtained similar results . ) in other words , the previous catalogs missed at least half of the sources of shear and convergence .",
    "the problem was that they focused on the region within @xmath5 of the lens , but ( in the galaxies approach ) the galaxies have extended dark matter halos , requiring the inclusion of group members out to the full virial radius of the group in order to fully characterize environmental effects in lens models .    with this thought in mind , we must consider how spectroscopic incompleteness may affect the results in table [ galaxies.shear ] .",
    "we can not account for galaxies that we missed , but we can ask how our results would have differed had we omitted a few of the galaxies that we did actually include .",
    "the effects of incompleteness on the net convergence are simple : since convergences from different galaxies combine in a simple scalar sum ( see eq .",
    "[ sum1 ] in the appendix ) , omitting galaxies causes us to underestimate the net convergence . turning this around",
    ", we can say that our estimates of @xmath204 are strict _ lower bounds _ on the convergence from the group . to be more quantitative , in analyzing subsamples of our group catalogs",
    "we find that the net convergence scales roughly with the number of group members ; so if the true number of members is , say , 50% larger than what we have observed then we expect the true convergence to be @xmath7650% larger than our estimate . for understanding biases in lens models ,",
    "it is very valuable to have a lower bound on the total convergence , because that can be turned into lower bounds on the biases .",
    "the shear is more complicated , because multiple contributions sum as tensors rather than scalars ( see eqs .  [ sum2c ] and [ sum2s ] ) ; adding more contributions can either increase or decrease the net shear , and modify the position angle .",
    "the effects depend on the spatial distribution of member galaxies . in pg1115",
    "the most important galaxies lie roughly in a line on the sky , which means that the direction of the net shear is robust against incompleteness , while the amplitude of the shear scales roughly with the number of group members .",
    "in contrast , in b1422 the galaxies are distributed more broadly , so incompleteness may change the shear direction by tens of degrees and the shear amplitude by tens of percent .",
    "( of course , the shear from the galaxies in b1422 is small , so even large fractional uncertainties are not so important . ) finally , in mg0751 the environmental effects are dominated by the galaxy g1 that is massive and close to the lens .",
    "the bottom line is that incompleteness does not significantly affect our qualitative conclusions . since our estimate of the net convergence is a lower bound , we know that our conclusion that groups are important on mg0751 , pg1115 , and b1422 is robust .",
    "while it is possible that our conclusion that the groups are not so important in mg1654 , bri0952 , and b2114 could change if we measure more galaxies and find that @xmath49 rises , the observed correspondence between th group velocity dispersion and richness ( see  4.2 ) suggests that adding more members would not affect @xmath49 significantly .",
    "incompleteness issues will need to be considered when making detailed quantitative comparisons between our environment observations and lens models .",
    "it is important to understand the similarities and differences between the results from the `` group halo '' and `` galaxies '' limits .",
    "we have already noted that both limits lead to the same conclusions about which groups are important for lensing .",
    "all three high-@xmath36 groups ( mg0751 , pg1115 , and b1422 ) produce a significant convergence in both approaches , so these groups can not be ignored in lens models . at the same time ,",
    "two of the low-@xmath36 groups ( bri0952 and b2114 ) produce a small shear and convergence in both approaches , suggesting that these groups are not so important for lensing .",
    "while this latter conclusion may not seem exciting , it is actually quite valuable .",
    "two - image lenses ( including both bri0952 and b2114 ) suffer from a strong degeneracy between ellipticity and shear , if both quantities are unknown .",
    "that degeneracy can now be broken by ruling out models with large shear .",
    "the situation is less clear for mg1654 , because the group halo analysis implies negligible shear , while the galaxies analysis yields a small but non - negligible shear @xmath205 ( and that could be an underestimate ) .    when we turn to a more quantitative comparison of the two approaches , we notice some significant differences .",
    "the differences suggest that it may be possible to distinguish between the group halo and galaxies limits , and thus to learn about the distribution of dark matter within the groups .",
    "for example , in b1422 the group halo analysis leads to a moderate convergence and shear , while the galaxies analysis leads to a larger convergence but a negligible shear .",
    "lens models require a large shear @xmath206 that is marginally consistent with the group halo approach ( given our uncertainties ) but grossly inconsistent with the galaxies approach . in pg1115 , as in b1422 , lens models require large external shear @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the group halo limit result ( @xmath207 ) is within 1@xmath106 of the model requirement while the galaxies limit gives a factor of three lower shear , inconsistent with predictions .",
    "the results in both b1422 and pg1115  the two highest velocity dispersion groups  suggest that the mass is distributed in a common halo rather than being attached to the individual group members ( as might be expected if high velocity dispersion groups are more dynamically evolved ) .",
    "this hypothesis needs to be examined more carefully with detailed lens models ; rather than just comparing the shear required by lens models with that inferred from our observations , it is important to build models that explicitly incorporate the environment ( which may even consist of multiple subgroup halos ; see  4.1 ) in both the group halo and galaxies limits and see whether either case can fit the lens data .",
    "systems like b1422 and pg1115 may provide an exciting opportunity to determine the distribution of dark matter in a distant group .",
    "we also note that kz04 used pg1115 as a fiducial example with which to asses environment - related biases in lens models .",
    "@xcite suggested that pg1115 is a very atypical lens environment , and that kz04 therefore overestimated environmental effects . to the contrary , we find that pg1115 is nothing if not typical : the group s kinematic properties and shear and convergence are consistent with at least half of the groups in our sample .",
    "another interesting system is mg0751 . here , the galaxies analysis is dominated by the g1 galaxy , lying just 6from the lens .",
    "even so , @xcite showed that lens models including only the lens galaxy , g1 , and up to three other nearby galaxies can not fit the lens data .",
    "it will be interesting to use new lens models to test the hypothesis that both g1 and the common group halo contain significant mass , and to see whether we can constrain their relative masses .",
    "we must issue two warnings , however .",
    "first , the projected offset of g1 from the lens galaxy is just 20 @xmath167 kpc , which lies at the inner limit of the range studied by @xcite ; thus , the reliability of the weak lensing calibration is not clear .",
    "second , we show in  4.5.2 that mg0751 also has a significant shear from a group along the line of sight , which must be included in lens models along with the group at the lens redshift .    in summary ,",
    "our results above show that : ( 1 ) group environments , whether the mass lies with individual member halos ( galaxies limit ) or in a common group halo ( group halo limit ) , can contribute significantly ( @xmath208 ) to the lens potential .",
    "( 2 ) if the members have halos ( galaxies limit ) , they can have a big effect , perhaps even greater than that of a common group halo .",
    "( 3 ) in the galaxies limit , correcting for incompleteness is only going to boost the convergence ( but will move the shears in either direction ) . ( 4 ) in the highest velocity dispersion groups , the shears produced in the group halo limit are more consistent with the observationally required values , suggesting that we might be able to discriminate between the models of the mass distribution .",
    "finally , it is remarkable that the three lenses with significant environmental effects include both quad lenses ( pg1115 and b1422 ) and the one quad / ring ( mg0751 ) , whereas the double / ring ( mg1654 ) and the two double lenses ( bri0952 and b2114 ) all have small convergence and shear .",
    "while this result is limited by small number statistics , it may suggest a correlation between image configuration and environment .",
    "conventional wisdom ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) holds that shear does not significantly affect the relative numbers of quads and doubles .",
    "however , kz04 argue that treating environment properly ( including terms beyond a simple shear ) does change the quad / double ratio .",
    "our new results provide empirical evidence that there is a connection .",
    "since lensing is a projected phenomenon , we must consider whether structures projected along the line of sight significantly affect strong lens systems .",
    "different theoretical approaches to studying the effects of interlopers on strong lensing in a @xmath209cdm universe have yielded contradictory results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so an empirical approach is clearly necessary . to date",
    ", there are only three lenses with confirmed line - of - sight groups and several other candidates @xcite . here",
    "we present the first systematic survey for structures along the line - of - sight to strong lens systems .",
    "the large redshift baseline and wide field of view of our spectroscopic survey make it ideally suited to address this issue .",
    "our first task is to estimate the `` zone of influence '' for a perturber along the line of sight to each lens in our sample .",
    "although it has not been done before , the calculation is straightforward using the formalism presented in the appendix .",

    "( because we do not see rich clusters along the lines of sight to these lenses , this range of @xmath36 should span the observed range of structures . )",
    "the grayscale is explained in the figure caption .",
    "we consider the zone of influence to be the region in which @xmath215 , i.e. , the unshaded ( white ) region in the figure .",
    "the shape of this region is not sensitive to the fact that an sis halo has an infinite extent ; a cut - off halo radius of 300 kpc does not change the zone of influence . also interesting",
    "are regions in which @xmath210 and @xmath211 go negative ( shaded black ) , which represents a breakdown of our formalism .",
    "this happens only when the intrinsic convergence of the perturber is @xmath216 , which means that the offset between the lens and perturber is small enough that the lens actually lies within the einstein radius of the perturber ( see the appendix ) . in this case , the `` perturber '' is no longer just a perturbation because its caustics interact with those of the main lens galaxy , and we would observe a strong lensing effect from the second mass as well .",
    "this breakdown does not affect our conclusions because we do not actually see any structures lying within this region ; besides , any objects that lie so close to the line of sight to the lens would presumably be known from previous observations .",
    "* for figure see file f6_sm.jpg *    as the velocity dispersion of the perturber increases , the zone of its influence grows dramatically @xmath217 .",

    "another striking feature of figure [ sigma ] is the very wide redshift baseline in front of and behind the lens over which a perturber can cause significant effects .",

    "as before , we note that convergence is a scalar and that the contribution from an overdensity is always positive , and conclude that identifying additional prominent structures would only _ increase _ the total convergence @xmath204 .",
    "the change is that an uncertainty in the convergence zeropoint prevents us from declaring that we have obtained a strict lower bound on the total convergence from the line of sight .",
    "the zeropoint uncertainty arises from the effects of underdensities such as voids .",
    "strong lensing calculations conventionally assume that there are a few density peaks superposed on top of a smooth background at the mean density of the universe .",
    "voids can then be thought of as regions where the density is negative ( relative to the mean ) , which contribute _ negative convergence _ to the lens potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if there is a significant negative convergence , it effectively changes the convergence zeropoint : in summing the effects of overdense structures along the line of sight , we should start not from zero but from the appropriate negative convergence .",
    "we can not measure the convergence zeropoint directly because that requires knowledge of the local density of matter ( dark and luminous ) at every point along the line of sight , which is impossible to obtain even with complete redshift surveys .",
    "nevertheless , we can make a useful estimate based on a simple model .",
    "we create monte carlo simulations of random lines of sight in a universe in which some of the mass is contained in halos while the rest is in a smooth background at a level below the mean density . in these simulations we are able to determine the total convergence @xmath204 from density fluctuations along the line of sight , as well as the contribution @xmath246 from prominent structures ( @xmath246 is analogous to what we compute above from our data ) .",
    "we can then interpret the difference , @xmath247 , as the convergence zeropoint .",
    "( details of the calculation , and further discussion of the results , are given by @xcite . )    considering many random lines of sight , we find that @xmath248 has a mean of zero and a dispersion of @xmath249 , for typical lens and source redshifts and reasonable halo mass functions . because the zeropoint uncertainty is small , we believe that our @xmath204 values above are probably lower limits on the total convergence . in other words , it is unlikely that voids contribute enough negative convergence to counter the positive @xmath49 from prominent peaks in a given line of sight .",
    "the main result is that four of the eight lenses in our sample have significant interloping structures .",
    "mg0751 , pg1115 , and b1422 each have one structure , and he2149 has three .",
    "at least one of those structures , along the line of sight to mg0751 , has a significant contribution to the lens potential .",
    "this perturbing group lies at a redshift of @xmath250 , which places it between the lens galaxy and the source quasar , and has a velocity dispersion @xmath158 @xmath3  based on the six members that we have identified . with a centroid that lies at a small projected offset of 28  from the lens , the group contributes a convergence and shear @xmath251 .",
    "this is clearly an important contribution to the lens potential  in fact , it is slightly stronger than our estimate of the contribution from the group at the lens redshift ( in the group halo limit ) .",
    "it represents one more piece in the interesting puzzle of fully understanding lensing in the mg0751 system .    to our knowledge ,",
    "our lens sample is not biased toward having significant line - of - sight effects .",
    "our survey methods are , if anything , somewhat biased _ against _ finding line - of - sight structures ( as discussed above ) .",
    "therefore , our discovery of a significant structure in 1/8 lenses suggests that line - of - sight effects are important in at least @xmath7610% of all lenses .",
    "that estimate needs to be confirmed with a larger sample , but it does indicate that lensing effects from the line of sight deserve further attention .",
    "we have presented the first results from our spectroscopic survey of the environments of strong gravitational lenses .",
    "we have used multislit spectroscopy to measure the redshifts of 355 galaxies in the fields of eight strong gravitational lenses with lens galaxies at redshifts between 0.25 and 0.50 . after adding 16 redshifts from the literature , we have analyzed a total sample of 371 galaxies with redshifts .",
    "the lens galaxy belongs to a poor group in six of the eight systems in our sample .",
    "we discover three new groups associated with the lens galaxy of bri0952 ( five members ) , mg1654 ( seven members ) , and b2114 ( five members ) .",
    "we more than double the number of members for another three previously known groups around the lenses mg0751 ( now 13 members ) , pg1115 ( 13 members ) , and b1422 ( 16 members ) .",
    "these six groups add to the still small number of all poor groups identified at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we determine the kinematics of the six groups , including their mean velocities , velocity dispersions , and projected spatial centroids . for the newly discovered groups , we quantify these properties for the first time . for the other three groups , the increased membership allows us to make more robust estimates of the kinematic properties of the groups than previously possible .",
    "the highest velocity dispersions we measure ( 320 to 470 @xmath3  for mg0751 , pg1115 , and b1422 ) are consistent with those of nearby dynamically - evolved , x - ray luminous groups ( mz98 ) , while the lower velocity dispersions ( 110 to 200 @xmath3 ) are more typical of dynamically younger groups at low redshift . in the two cases where a diffuse x - ray component has been measured ( pg1115 and b1422 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray temperatures and our velocity dispersions are consistent with the local @xmath36-@xmath37 relation ( mz98 ) .",
    "to understand the evolution of groups and their galaxies , it is important to determine the relation of the brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) to the group potential .",
    "( in four of the six groups , mg0751 , bri0952 , pg1115 , and b1422 , the lens galaxy is not the bgg . )",
    "we find that the bgg generally lies off the center of the group potential and occupies an orbit indistinguishable from the other group members .",
    "this result is surprising in comparison with nearby , x - ray luminous groups , in which the bgg is always a giant elliptical galaxy occupying the center of the potential , with an orbit distinct from the other group members ( zm98 ) .",
    "however , most of the effect we see comes from the three groups with lower velocity dispersions . in two",
    "( mg0751 and pg1115 ) of the three highest velocity dispersion groups , the bggs lie within the errors of the group centroid , suggesting that at least these systems are comparable to dynamically - evolved poor groups in the local universe .",
    "we use our detailed observations of the groups to assess how environments affect gravitational lens models .",
    "a key ingredient is an accurate determination of any offset between the lens galaxy and the group centroid on the sky . in mg0751 , pg1115 , b1422 , and mg1654 ,",
    "the lens galaxy is offset spatially from the group centroid .",
    "obtaining a larger sample ( which is underway ) to determine the full distribution of lens vs. group offsets will be important for understanding how lens environments affect statistical quantities such as the quad / double ratio and lensing constraints on @xmath4 ( see kz04 ) .    to quantify environmental contributions to lens potentials in more detail",
    ", we estimate the convergence ( gravitational focusing ) and shear ( tidal distortions ) from each group .",
    "we consider two different models of the group mass distribution that bound the extremes of dynamical states of groups",
    ". the members of young groups are likely to still have large dark matter halos and the group mass may be dominated by the dark matter halos of the individual member galaxies . in this approach",
    ", we calibrate the shear and convergence from each galaxy based on observations of weak lensing in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , and then sum the contributions appropriately . as the group evolves , these halos may be truncated via interactions , so the mass will be redistributed into a common group halo that may be the dominant group mass component . in this approach , we approximate that halo as an isothermal sphere and use the measured group centroid and velocity dispersion to compute the convergence and shear .",
    "at least three of the lenses in our sample ( mg0751 , pg1115 , and b1422 ) have convergences and shears large enough ( @xmath208 ) to indicate that the environment plays a significant role in the lens potential . for these systems , our survey substantially improves the observational constraints that will be needed to make detailed lens models that properly include environmental effects .",
    "remarkably , the high shear and convergence values occur in the quad lens systems , while the environments of the double lenses are relatively weak .",
    "this result suggests that environment may affect the relative numbers of quad and double lenses , a topic much debated in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the other lenses , the conclusion that environment does not significantly affect the lens potential is also valuable : constraining previously unknown environmental terms to be near zero will still improve lens models .",
    "for the first time , we present a systematic assessment of whether structures along the line of sight to lens systems are important for lensing .",
    "we show that interloping structures can in principle affect lens models over a wide range of spatial and redshift offsets .",
    "our pencil - beam survey is ideally suited to identifying such structures if they are present .",
    "we find that at least four out of eight lenses have prominent line - of - sight structures , i.e. , groups whose spatial and redshift offsets place them in the `` zone of influence '' of the lens .",
    "mg0751 , pg1115 , and b1422 each have one substantial group along the line of sight , while he2149 has three groups at different redshifts . of these",
    ", the interloping group in mg0751 has a significant effect on the lens potential .",
    "our survey is actually biased against interloping groups ( and is not complete ) , so finding that at least one of eight lenses ( @xmath252 ) is affected by projected structures is intriguing and worth further study .",

    "the only assumption is that the convergence and shear are small , so that we can work at first order in both quantities",
    ". we will show below that there is a context in which this assumption breaks down , but with no effect on our conclusions .",
    "if the perturber were at the same redshift as the lens galaxy , it would produce a convergence and shear given by @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the lens potential of the perturber . here",
    "@xmath136 is the shear strength , and @xmath255 the shear direction ( which we measure north through east ) . if the perturber lies at a different redshift @xmath256 , then the convergence and shear are modified to the effective values @xcite @xmath257 } { ( 1-\\beta\\kappa)^2-(\\beta\\gamma)^2 } \\ , \\\\",
    "\\label{geff }    { \\gamma_{\\rm eff}}&= & \\frac { ( 1-\\beta ) \\gamma }      { ( 1-\\beta\\kappa)^2-(\\beta\\gamma)^2 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the angular diameter distance between redshifts @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "note that when @xmath262 , we have @xmath263 and so we recover @xmath264 and @xmath265 . moving the perturber away from the lens redshift increases @xmath266 and decreases @xmath210 and @xmath211 .    in certain circumstances , the effective convergence and shear can apparently go negative , which seems puzzling .",
    "the sign flip occurs only when the denominator in eqs .",
    "( [ keff])([geff ] ) goes negative .",
    "this can happen only when @xmath49 and @xmath136 are sufficiently large  in particular , only when the line of sight passes through the _ strong lensing _",
    "regime of the perturber .",
    "( for an isothermal sphere [ below ] , this corresponds to @xmath267 . ) in this case , the lensing critical curves of the perturber would merge with those of the main lens galaxy , which would completely change the configuration of lensed images .",
    "in other words , our formalism breaks down when the `` perturbation '' is sufficiently strong , but if it were that strong it would ( presumably ) be known already .",
    "if @xmath49 and @xmath136 are small , then we can expand eqs .",
    "( [ keff])([geff ] ) to first order write @xmath268 we can think of @xmath221 and @xmath222 as the `` normalized '' convergence and shear  the actual perturbation strength , normalized by the value that would apply if the perturber were at the same redshift as the lens galaxy .",
    "we use this quantity in the text as a simple way to characterize the redshift dependence of the perturbation strength .",
    "we now specify how to determine the net convergence and shear when multiple perturbers are present .",
    "this is relevant when we assess the effects of a group around a lens by considering the member galaxies (  4.4.2 ) , and also when we consider the effects of structures along the line of sight (  4.5.2 ) .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ keqn])([gseqn ] ) that the quantities @xmath49 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270 are linear in the perturber potential .",
    "the shear is a combination of @xmath269 and @xmath270 that actually corresponds to a rank-2 traceless tensor , or a headless vector ( headless because it is invariant under rotation by @xmath271 ) .",
    "( see @xcite for more discussion . ) thus , if we know the effective convergence @xmath272 and shear @xmath273 , as well as the shear position angle @xmath274 ( north through east ) , for a set of perturbers , then the proper way to compute the net effects is as follows : @xmath275 note that @xmath276 for any real perturber , so the terms in the convergence sum all go in the same direction .",
    "by contrast , the cosine and sine factors mean that terms in the shear sums may add or cancel . hence , incompleteness in our sample can only cause us to underestimate @xmath204 , but it may cause us to over- or underestimate @xmath277 .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall how convergence and shear affect lens models .",
    "convergence is largely responsible for systematic biases in lens models ( kz04 ) , through the mass sheet degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the biases can be thought of as simple rescalings of model parameters , such as : @xmath278 where @xmath266 is a mass parameter related to the lens velocity dispersion , @xmath279 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath280 is the image magnification ( see kz04 and references therein ) .",
    "neglect of convergence is the main source of biases in lensing results for quad lenses .",
    "double lenses , by contrast , are so under - constrained that poor knowledge of convergence and shear leads to lens models that are just plain wrong . in both cases , detailed observations of lens environments are necessary to derive the constraints necessary to make lens models reliable .",
    "while the formalism presented so far is fully general , it is valuable to discuss two particular perturber models . first , if we can approximate a perturber as an isothermal sphere then we can easily relate measurable quantities to @xmath49 and @xmath136 . specifically , for an isothermal sphere with velocity dispersion @xmath106 and impact parameter @xmath212 , we have @xmath281 we can measure the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath36 of the group and the offset @xmath212 between the lens galaxy and group centroid , use them to determine @xmath49 and @xmath136 , and finally fold in the redshift difference as above to determine @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the second specific model we consider is a power law density profile calibrated by weak lensing . in a large and detailed analysis of galaxy ",
    "galaxy weak lensing in the sloan digital sky survey , @xcite present the average shear as a function of radius for a sample of 127,001 lens galaxies .",
    "they find that the shear profile is consistent with a simple power law @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the critical surface density for lensing , which carries all the dependence on the lens and source redshifts through the angular diameter distances @xmath284 , @xmath285 , and @xmath286 between the observer , lens , and source .",
    "@xcite tabulate the values of @xmath287 and @xmath288 for galaxies in three luminosity bins . and @xmath287 .",
    "at any rate , those parameters are more fundamental in terms of what they measure .",
    "one additional technical point is that sheldon et al .",
    "quote lengths using comoving distances , but we convert those to angular diameter distances in our analysis . ] for any given galaxy that we observe , we convert from our measured @xmath289-band apparent magnitude to absolute magnitude in the sdss @xmath290-band , using the color and @xmath291-corrections computed with @xcite spectral synthesis models .",
    "( the luminosity bins used by sheldon et al .",
    "are wide enough that small systematic uncertainties in the magnitudes do not shift galaxies between bins . )",
    "we then look up the values of @xmath288 and @xmath287 for each luminosity from table 2 of sheldon et al .",
    "we use the lens and source redshifts to compute @xmath292 and hence @xmath293 .",
    "the last thing we need is the convergence . for a power law @xmath294",
    ", there is a very simple relation between shear and convergence : @xmath295 thus , it is straightforward to compute @xmath49 and @xmath136 for each galaxy .",
    "we can then factor in the redshift distance relative to the main lens galaxy as described above ."
