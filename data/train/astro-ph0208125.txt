    "the radio inner jets resemble those in agn in that the jet length is roughly inversely proportional to the frequency , and a  core - shift \" is observed between 1.6 and 5 ghz  indicative of self - absorption @xcite .",
    "the differences are that the ss433 jet is ballistic , it contains protons , and a large fraction of the jet material is probably thermal .    the approaching and receding jet sides are separated by a radio gap , as was predicted by stirling , spencer & watson @xcite .",
    "this is caused by free - free absorption due to a disk - like outflow from the central binary system .",
    "the brightness ratio of the two jet sides increases with frequency , and at 22 ghz the receding jet is almost completely absorbed ( fig .",

    "the brightness ratio reflects only the doppler - boosting effect and there seems to be no significant free - free absorption on scales larger than @xmath050  au ( assuming a distance of 5 kpc ) .    during large flares",

    "we identified a radio emitting region perpendicular to the normal jets @xcite which was confirmed in a 1998 experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gp017 ] ) .",
    "as there were indications from observations , numerical simulations @xcite and theoretical works @xcite that a significant fraction of the accreted matter leaves the system in its equatorial plane , we refer to this region as the equatorial outflow .",
    "we stress that the outflow is not constrained in a narrow plane , the term  equatorial \" refering to the fact that the region is not related to the radio beams of ss433 that emanate from the poles of the central engine .",
    "an independent group also observed this outflow ( blundell et al .",

    "emission from the equatorial outflow has been detected in seven vlbi experiments .",
    "the region is sometimes smooth , but compact , brighter features appear frequently .",
    "one of these components was observed to move away from the centre at a projected speed of 1200@xmath6500  km / s ( paragi , fejes & szab , these proceedings ) .",
    "this is significantly larger than the estimated terminal wind speed of @xmath0300  km / s @xcite .",
    "fabrika suggested that the faster disk wind ( @xmath01500  km / s ) could develop shock waves into the slow ( @xmath0100  km / s ) outflow from time to time , as the disk precesses .",

    "since the very long baseline array observed ss433 in a multi - frequency experiment in 1995 , it has been known that microquasars may produce radio emission not only in the well - studied jets , but also in their equatorial region @xcite . because the presence of an outflow had been suggested based on observations in the optical and in x - ray @xcite , the radio emission was naturally attributed to this equatorial flow .",
    "recent works in the uv @xcite and ir regimes ( fuchs et al . , these proceedings ) also support this scenario .",
    "we initiated vlba and global vlbi ( evn+hartebeesthoek+vlba ) observations to monitor changes in this region on milliarcsecond scales .",
    "the existence of the equatorial emission region was confirmed by 1.6 ghz global vlbi observations ( see fig .  3 of paragi et al . , these proceedings )",
    "on 6 june 1998 .",
    "there were two radio components ( indicated by n1 and s1 ) , as in 1995 , but their separation and position angle were different .",
    "n1 had a brightness temperature of @xmath12  k , indicative of a non - thermal emission mechanism .",
    "it was also identified at 5  ghz on 22 may and 16 june 1998 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bp42cd ] ) .",
    "because the jets precess and there is no well - determined , compact feature in the centre on milliarcsecond ( mas ) scales , it is difficult to find a good reference point in the source .",
    "we assumed that the binary is located in the middle of the radio gap @xcite .",
    "the separation of n1 from this reference point increased significantly . by assigning a 1  mas error to the position measurements ( including the uncertainty in the reference point )",
    ", we determined an outward proper motion of @xmath13  mas / day .",
    "if this is due to a bulk motion of matter , this corresponds to an outflow velocity of ( 1200@xmath6500)/@xmath14  km / s .",
    "changes in the region were further monitored in 2000 with a global vlbi network ( images not shown here ) .",
    "the results from these experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "we observed ss433 with the vlba ( 5 , 8.4 , 15 and 22 ghz ) on 18 april 1998 during a large flare .",
    "the core - jet region of the source disappeared in the flare .",
    "instead we detected four pairs of plasmons ejected from the centre ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bp42b ] ) .",
    "most of these components ( except e1 ) had a very steep spectrum between 5 and 8.4 ghz .",
    "interestingly , the spectrum between 15 and 22 ghz was somewhat flatter .",
    "the spectral properties of the plasmons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : color ] , on the colour  colour ( @xmath15 diagram @xcite .",
    "the components are already in the optically thin phase of their evolution at the observing frequencies . at this epoch",
    "the flare had not yet reached its maximum .",
    "the most straightforward explanation for an increasing flux density during the optically thin phase is that a new generation of electrons was accelerated in the plasmons .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached using single dish radio flux density measurements by seaquist et al ."
