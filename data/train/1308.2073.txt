    "detection of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay searches are of great interests in both particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "many experimental groups use different techniques to search for the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , postulated by theories beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the two - phase noble liquid is a typical technique  @xcite due to the large mass , self - shielding ability , scalability , high scintillation and ionization yields . both primary scintillation light and secondary scintillation light from ionized electrons drifting from the liquid to the gas phase , from a wimp elastic scattering on the target nucleus ,",
    "are detected and are used for energy and position reconstruction , as well as for particle identification .",
    "a two - phase xenon detector can also be used to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay from @xmath2 simultaneously .",
    "various methods are used to detect these signals .",
    "so far the most successful method is to use low radioactive photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts )  @xcite .",
    "however , pmts are expensive and the radioactivity from them are one of the dominant background in dark matter experiments . on the other hand , micro - pattern gaseous detectors promise a low material cost , a flexible readout pattern and high radio - purity  @xcite which may open a new way for constructing the detector for the next generation experiments for rare event searches  @xcite .",
    "the fabrication of a micromegas usually only involves attaching a micro - mesh on an anode board , much simpler than the fabrication of a pmt .",
    "thus the cost compared to a pmt - like system can be greatly reduced . in particular",
    ", micromegas attracts a lot of interests due to its additional features , such as the potential to reach a very low energy threshold and an excellent energy resolution  @xcite .",
    "micromegas with a minimum gain of 100 will be able to detect the few tens of electrons produced from a 10  @xmath1 nuclear recoil event from the interaction of a dark matter particle in liquid xenon .",
    "an excellent energy resolution is not crucial for dark matter detection , but will benefit the simultaneous search for neutrinoless double beta decay using the xe detector .",
    "micromegas can also perform precise tracking when integrated with fine readout structures  @xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", two main manufacturing methods , the bulk technique  @xcite based on the photolithography technique and the microbulk technique  @xcite based on the etching of thin - kapton foils , are successfully developed for the micromegas .",
    "the bulk technique has already been used to produce large structures with reliable performance . in the meantime",
    ", the microbulk technique has been used to produce micromegas structures with excellent energy resolutions for low energy x - ray and highly ionizing charged particles  @xcite , combined with high radio - purity for its prospects in a real experiment .",
    "although the bulk and the microbulk techniques have shown success in manufacturing micromegas detectors , we would like to explore a simple and cost - saving method to fabricate the device with similar performance . attaching a micromesh to the anode by using a thermo - bond film",
    "is one novel way to achieve this goal .",
    "the bulk and microbulk techniques need the standard lithographic and etching processes , while attaching a micromesh to the anode by using a thermo - bond film is much simpler . the thermo - bond film is a kind of specially formulated adhesive film which is commercially available and",
    "is designed to be used for bonding metal and plastic materials .    in this paper",

    "for the fabrication of micromegas structures , a 350-lines - per - inch stainless steel woven wire mesh was stretched at a tension of 17 - 19 n / cm .",
    "the choice of the woven micromesh , in view of application in cryogenic detectors , is due to its robustness and tolerance to the boiling noble vapour as was pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "the material used to separate the micromesh from the anode readout plane is a kind of heat - active thermo - bond film which has a 51  @xmath3 m thick polyester core layer sandwiched in between two dry polymer layers of the same thickness . both the core layer and the adhesive polymers are outstanding insulators .",
    "such thermo - bond film is dry at room temperature and could be activated for bonding at an internal temperature of 100 - 120  @xmath4 and a pressure of 7 - 15  n/@xmath5 .",
    "it is ideally suitable for the fabrication of micromegas avalanche gaps due to its excellent bonding strength to metal and most plastic substrates .",
    "the avalanche gap of the micromegas prototype was constructed on a 90-mm - diameter printed circuit board ( pcb ) which has a thickness of 2.5  @xmath6 .",
    "there are 25 gold - coated copper pads on the anode pcb .",
    "each pad is 7.9  @xmath6 @xmath7 7.9  @xmath6 in size .",
    "the pads are spaced 0.15  @xmath6 in between and form a 5 @xmath7 5 array .",
    "the thermo - bond film was tailored into a rectangular frame , which was placed between the stretched micromesh and the pcb .",
    "the whole set was then moved on a flat hot plate and heat was applied from the bottom of the pcb until the thermo - bond film frame melt and became adhesive .",
    "pressures were given by a rubber roller from the top of the micromesh and the bonding was achieved .",
    "after cooled down to room temperature , the micromesh was firmly attached to the anode plane at a distance of about 120  @xmath8 away by the thermo - bond film frame .",
    "we also tested the bonded structure at the cryogenic temperature down to 81  @xmath9 for about 12 hours .",

    "the observed peak at 59.5  @xmath1 is lower than the peak at 26.4  @xmath1 , which is likely due to the smaller photoelectric absorption ratio and larger energy smearing of the 59.5  @xmath1 gamma rays .",

    "other low energy x - rays from np l x - rays at 13.9  @xmath1 , 17.7  @xmath1 and 21.0  @xmath1 also contribute to the spectrum , but their peaks are not well resolved .",
    "the transmission rate of primary electrons in the drift gap through the micromesh affects the total amount of charge collected on the anode . in order to maximize the charge collection  @xcite , we scanned the field ratios between the avalanche and drift region to reach a maximum transmission rate .",

    "the detector was configured with the field ratio allowing maximum charge collection efficiency in different pressures for the gas gain measurements .",
    "the gas gain is defined as the collected number of electrons on the anode divided by the number of ionization electrons produced based on the energy deposition of alpha particles and a w value of 22  ev in xenon gas  @xcite .",
    "the electronic chain with the detector connected was calibrated by injecting a known charge into the charge sensitive amplifier through a 1 pf capacitor .",
    "the corresponding charge with the registered channel in the mca was then derived .",
    "the results of gas gain as a function of the applied voltage on the micromesh are shown in fig .",
    "[ yuehua6 ] .",
    "gas gains exceeding 200 were achieved at pressures up to 3  @xmath14 at room temperature .",
    "the measurement at higher gains was limited by the dynamic range of the electronics chain . without the limitation of the electronics chain , a maximum gain of more than 300",
    "could be achieved by increasing the voltage by 10 - 30  @xmath25 on the micromesh before embarking regular discharges .",
    "we repeated the measurement with another micromegas prototype with the same type at 3  atm xenon gas in the room temperature ( fig .",
    "[ yuehua6 ] ) .",
    "the gain for the prototype shows similar trend of increasing with an increase of the voltage on the micromesh , but with a slightly higher gain values than those from the first prototype at the same voltage .",
    "one reason for the gain difference between the two prototypes is the difference of the avalanche gaps produced during the micromesh attaching process . at the time of measurement , the only charge sensitive pre - amplifier available to us is the clearpulse 580 , which has a higher gain than the ortec 142ah used for the first micromegas prototype .",
    "this limited our capability to measure the gas gain only up to 45 .          in these measurements",
    ", the xenon gas was not purified through any purifier .",
    "electronegative impurities play an important role by attaching to the primary ionization electrons .",
    "alpha particles entering the drift gap with different incident directions produce ionized electrons with different mean drift lengths .",
    "generally , electrons from alpha tracks more parallel to the cathode plane arrive at the anode in a closer time period , which produce a signal with a shorter rise time .",
    "these electrons also drift longer than the electrons from alpha tracks more perpendicular to the cathode plane .",
    "therefore they have a larger probability to be attached to the electronegative impurities , resulting a smaller pulse amplitude .    to understand the significance of such an effect and to evaluate the best possible energy resolution for such a micromegas detector , the alpha signals after the pre - amplifier were directly recorded by the oscilloscope for off - line analysis .",

    "the correlation between the signal rise time and the amplitude for different drift fields in 3  @xmath14 pressure xenon are shown in fig .",
    "[ yuehua8 ] .",
    "as expected , the amplitude increases when the drift field was increased from 100  v / cm to 350  v / cm .",
    "but it starts to decrease when the drift field is higher than 350 v / cm , which is due to the smaller electron transmission rate at a lower field ratio .",

    "the cathode and mesh voltages were 1404 v and 780 v respectively . ]",
    "pressure xenon gas .",
    "the voltage on the micromesh was fixed at 850  v. the field ratios ( @xmath28 ) are shown in the parentheses in the plot . ]    in order to understand the influence of ionization attachment on the energy resolution , cuts based on the rise time are applied to the amplitude distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ yuehua9 ] .",
    "the selection of the events with longer rise time , corresponding to alpha particles with tracks more perpendicular to the micromesh , removes the long tail at the lower end of the spectrum .",
    "a 100  @xmath37 cut on the rise time gives an energy resolution of 5.4% ( fwhm ) .",
    "this value is almost the best we could achieve with the micromegas in the current setup . to achieve a better energy resolution closing to the statistical limit from the fano factor and multiplication variance , we need to improve the micromegas fabrication technique and to purify the xenon gas to suppress the ionization attachment to impurities .    the resolution at different voltages in different pressures are plotted in fig .",
    "[ yuehua10 ] ( open symbols ) together with those obtained from the function fitting the mca recorded spectra ( solid symbols ) .",
    "the achievable resolutions are worse than those obtained with a microbulk micromegas detector  @xcite and it is very likely due to the source coating which increases the energy deposition fluctuations , as well as the non - uniform gas gap in a high field operation .",
    "unlike the microbulk micromegas , the micromesh here is supported only at the edges .",

    "we have studied the characteristics of a micromegas prototype fabricated by the thermo - bond method in different pressures of xenon gas at room temperature . from our measurement , low energy gamma rays down to 8 kev can be observed .",
    "gas gains above 200 are achieved in pure xenon gas up to 3  @xmath14 pressure with the alpha particles from a @xmath11am source .",
    "the resolution is better than 9% ( fwhm ) using the mca recorded spectrum and is further improved to 5% by using a pulse shape analysis .",
    "it should be noted that these obtained results also include fluctuations due to energy loss in the surface coating of americium source .",
    "our investigations of the micromegas operating at room temperature show its potential application for low energy event detection in xenon gas . in order to produce a device to be used in dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay searches ,",
