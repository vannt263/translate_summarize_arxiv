    "in the numerical and mathematical study of gravitational collapse , massless scalar fields have often been used as a matter field .",
    "they are simple , travel at the speed of light like gravitational waves , and may also be of interest as fundamental fields .",
    "similarly , the simplest models of gravitational collapse are spherically symmetric , going back to the key paper of oppenheimer and snyder @xcite on spherically symmetric collapse of dust to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "choptuik @xcite used the combination of massless scalar field matter with spherical symmetry to spectactular effect , initiating the study of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse : the generic presence of universality , scaling and self - similarity in the time evolution of initial data that are close to the threshold of collapse .",
    "( here we use the term collapse synonymously with black hole formation from regular initial data ) .",
    "the triad of universality , scaling and self - similarity was previously familiar from critical phenomena at second - order phase transitions in thermodynamics , understood in terms of renormalisation group theory .",
    "similarly , critical phenomena can be understood in terms of a renormalisation group flow on the space of classical initial data in general relativity that is at the same time a physical time evolution , for suitable choices of the lapse and shift @xcite .",
    "a novel feature in general relativity is the appearance of discrete self - similarity ( dss ) , rather than the continuous self - similarity ( css ) familiar elsewhere in physics ( such as fluid dynamics ) .",
    "one obvious direction to go in from the work of choptuik was to generalise to axisymmetry .",
    "abrahams and evans @xcite found scaling and dss in the collapse of polarised axisymmetric vacuum gravitational waves .",
    "these numerical results are widely believed to be correct but have still not been verified independently .    with matter",
    ", axisymmetry is also the maximal symmetry in which rotating collapse can be studied in 3 + 1 dimensions , leading to a kerr black hole .",
    "moreover , in axisymmetry , angular momentum forms a conserved current generated by the killing vector field @xmath9 , @xmath10 however , in 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions with axisymmetry , neither vacuum gravitational waves or an axisymmetric massless scalar field @xmath11 can carry angular momentum . a simple way of seeing this for the axisymmetric scalar field ( for simplicity assumed to be real ) is to note that @xmath12 the first term vanishes if the scalar field is itself axisymmetric , and the second term is by definition tangent to any axisymmetric slice , and so does not contribute to the noether charge @xmath13 .    a way of getting round that is to use a complex scalar field @xmath14 , where @xmath11 is axisymmetric but now complex , and @xmath15 is an integer .",
    "this results in an axisymmetric stress - energy tensor and spacetime .",
    "although using a complex scalar field appears to be a natural choice , this particular ansatz introduces a pseudo - centrifugal potential @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the cylindrical radius ) into the wave equation even when the angular momentum current vanishes identically , so the centrifugal repulsion appears to be unrelated to angular momentum in a way that appears to be atypical of intuitive ideas of the effect of angular momentum in collapse .",
    "choptuik , hirschmann , liebling and pretorius @xcite examined the case @xmath18 in 3 + 1 and found universality and scaling .",
    "the dss critical solution is distinct from the well - known one for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 critical solution is real ( up to a constant overall phase ) and nonrotating and an attractor even for rotating initial data , so that @xmath19 at the black - hole threshold .",
    "critical collapse of a real scalar field in spherical symmetry in 2 + 1 was investigated by pretorius and choptuik @xcite , and in more detail by us @xcite .",
    "there are a number of essential differences between 2 + 1 and all higher dimensions .",
    "first , a negative cosmological constant is required to form a black hole from regular data .",
    "this brings with it the existence of a reflecting timelike outer boundary ( at infinity ) .",
    "it also means that exactly self - similar solutions can not exist . finally ,",
    "because the mass in 2 + 1 dimensions is dimensionless , the black hole mass scaling can not be derived using a pure renormalisation group argument .    in @xcite we investigated these issues in the nonrotating ( @xmath7 ) case with @xmath11 real .",
    "we initially adopted as the definition of supercritical initial data ( in any given 1-parameter family of data ) that the ricci scalar at the centre blows up without any preceding minima and maxima .",
    "fine - tuning to the critical parameter thus identified , we found a universal critical solution that is approximately ( asymptotically on small spacetime scales ) css inside the lightcone of its ( naked ) singularity , but has a different symmetry outside the lightcone .",
    "( the asymptotic form inside the lightcone had previously been derived in closed form by garfinkle @xcite ) .",
    "we also found the familiar and expected scaling of the maximum of the ricci scalar , @xmath20 for subcritical data @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the scalar field in higher dimensions , we actually saw scaling of the values and locations of several maxima and minima of the ricci scalar .",
    "these must be features of the universal post - css subcritical evolution , rather than the css critical solution itself .",
    "we also found power - law scaling of the mass of the earliest marginally outer - trapped surface ( emots ) , @xmath21 we derived @xmath22 based on the interaction of the critical solution outside its lightcone , the cosmological constant and a single growing mode .",
    "our argument relies on a technical conjecture , but is supported by the numerical observation that the threshold value @xmath5 is the same for subcritical ricci scaling and supercritical mass scaling .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate critical collapse for the rotating axisymmetric complex scalar field ( @xmath6 and/or @xmath11 complex ) in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this fills the gap in the @xmath23 table of models studied so far . as an additional motivation , axisymmetry in 2 + 1 dimensions reduces the field equations to partial differential equations ( pdes ) in only two coordinates",
    "@xmath24 , even in the presence of angular momentum , so that there is no extra computational cost compared to spherical symmetry .",
    "looking ahead to future work on rotating fluid collapse in 2 + 1 dimensions , we have organised the material so that section  [ section : axisymmetry ] and appendixes  [ appendix : gauge]-[appendix : kerrads ] hold for any matter , while the rest of the paper is specific to rotating scalar field matter .",
    "we consider 2 + 1-dimensional asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes with a rotational killing vector @xmath25 . for clarity , we will refer to this symmetry as axisymmetry in general , but as spherical symmetry in the absence of rotation , when there is an additional reflection symmetry @xmath26 .",
    "in axisymmetry in 2 + 1 dimensions we make the metric ansatz @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath24 only . to consider asymptotically ads spacetimes , we rewrite this as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the length scale set by the cosmological constant @xmath1 as @xmath33 , and where we have defined the shorthands @xmath34 the coordinate ranges are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is helpful to keep in mind that in our convention @xmath38 at the centre @xmath39 of axisymmetry and @xmath40 at the ads outer boundary @xmath41 . in this ansatz",
    ", @xmath42 represents the global ads spacetime .",
    "these coordinates are a generalisation of those used in @xcite .",
    "we show in appendix  [ appendix : kerrads ] that the kerr - ads solution can also be expressed in these coordinates , so that these are good coordinates for simulating rotating collapse .",
    "we discuss the remaining gauge freedom in appendix  [ appendix : gauge ] .",
    "the upshot is that to fix the gauge completely we will impose @xmath43 at the outer boundary",
    ".      the einstein equations with a cosmological constant @xmath8 are @xmath44 in the units of @xcite , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in axisymmetry",
    "( with rotation ) , there are six independent components of the einstein equations .",
    "two can be written as wave equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , namely @xmath49 where we have defined the shorthands @xmath50 we also have two constraint equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , namely @xmath51 the last two einstein equations ( which become become trivial in spherical symmetry ) can be written as one evolution equation and one constraint for @xmath52 namely @xmath53 where we have defined the shorthand @xmath54 we show in appendix  [ appendix : kerrads ] that in vacuum @xmath55 is the angular momentum parameter of the btz metric .",
    "we have also introduced the following shorthands for the source terms of the six einstein equations : @xmath56      a marginally outer - trapped surface ( mots ) in axisymmetry is given by @xmath57 the curve @xmath58 in the @xmath59-plane defines the apparent horizon ( ah ) .",
    "an isolated horizon ( ih ) is a piece of the ah that is null .",
    "the apparent horizon is spacelike , timelike or null if the product @xmath60 is positive , negative or zero .",
    "consistently with ( [ jdef],[gammar ] ) , we define the quasilocal angular momentum @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the angular momentum density per unit volume of space , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the future - pointing unit normal and volume element on slices of constant @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath55 is the conserved quantity related to @xmath66 , and is therefore gauge - invariant and independent of the time slice on which we have integrated from the centre out to the point @xmath24 .    because mass in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions is dimensionless , @xmath67 has units of @xmath68 , and @xmath55 has units of length .",
    "the factor of @xmath69 has been inserted so that @xmath55 coincides with the expression for @xmath55 in kerr - ads spacetime .",
    "it is therefore constant in vacuum and reduces to the btz angular momentum .",
    "a possible quasilocal mass expression is the local btz mass parameter @xmath70 this is a scalar , and reduces to the constant btz mass in vacuum .",
    "however , we will see that , at least for the complex scalar field considered here , its mass aspect @xmath71 may become negative .",
    "alternatively , we could extend the 2 + 1 dimensional hawking mass from spherical symmetry @xcite @xmath72 to axisymmetry .",
