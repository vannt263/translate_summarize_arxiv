    "it has been understood almost since its discovery in 1980 that the quantum hall effect @xcite emerges from the non - trivial topology of landau levels @xcite .",
    "more recently it was realized that one can have topologically nontrivial states that differ from the quantum hall effect ( see @xcite for review ) . unlike the chern number however , the topological invariants characterizing such systems are only quantized as long as certain symmetries are present . the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) @xcite for example",
    "is protected by the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry .",
    "superconductors on the other hand are particle - hole symmetric , which allows to define a subclass of topological superconductors .",
    "topological insulators and superconductors were completely classified for non - interacting fermions @xcite and the qshe ( i.e. a 2d @xmath0topological insulator ) as well as 3d @xmath0topological insulators have been observed in solid state systems @xcite .",
    "cold atom experiments offer a large degree of control@xcite and allow for measurements impossible in solid state systems @xcite .",
    "therefore an implementation of topological insulators in these systems would allow to investigate them from a different perspective .",
    "theoretically , topological invariants are related to geometric berry phases of particles moving in bloch bands .",
    "recently , berry phases and corresponding topological invariants were directly measured in a cold atomic system in an optical lattice @xcite thus allowing a direct experimental investigation of the topology of bloch band wavefunctions .    while realizing quantum hall like systems of cold atoms has been a longstanding challenge @xcite , there was considerable progress in the implementation of artificial gauge fields @xcite and recently two experimental groups reported on the realization of the hofstadter hamiltonian in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "for the simulation of the qshe ( or , more generally , a @xmath0topological insulator ) with ultra - cold atoms artificial spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is required which has also been demonstrated experimentally @xcite ; different soc schemes have lead to several proposals for the implementation of two @xcite and three dimensional @xcite tr invariant topological insulators . in the recent experiment of the munich group @xcite abelian soc",
    "has successfully been implemented , which is sufficient for a realization of the qshe .",
    "also the recent mit experiment @xcite allows an implementation of abelian soc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose measurement schemes for @xmath0topological invariants in tr invariant topological insulators in two and three dimensions .",
    "our method uses one of the most important technical strengths of cold atom experiments , the ability to perform interferometric measurements .",

    "topological properties of 1d bloch bands are chacterized by the so - called zak phase @xcite .",
    "this is essentially berry s phase @xcite for a a trajectory enclosing a 1d brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "recent experiments with optical superlattices used a combination of bloch oscillations and ramsey interferometry to measure the zak phase of the dimerized lattice@xcite . in these experiments momentum integration",
    "was achieved with bloch oscillations of atoms in momentum space and berry s phase was measured using ramsey s interferometric protocol ( see @xcite and discussion below for more details ) .",
    "zak phase measurement in 1d is shown schematically in fig.[fig : sketchintro ] ( a ) .",
    "this approach can be extended to measure the chern number of two - dimensional bloch bands ( the idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) @xcite .",
    "the key is to measure zak phases for fixed values of momenta @xmath1 , and their winding in the bz @xmath2 yields the chern number ( in the entire paper we set the lattice constant @xmath3 ) .",
    "alternatively the geometric zak phases can be read out from semi - classical dynamics , which also allows one to measure the chern number @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the ideas of refs.@xcite for interferometric measurement of @xmath0invariants in tr - symmetric optical lattices .",
    "the key challenge in this case is to keep track of _ two _ kramers degenerate bands , required by tr invariance . defining the topological properties of such bands requires understanding how bloch eigenstates in the two bands relate to each other .",
    "we argue that the bloch / ramsey sequence should be supplemented by band switching as shown schematically in fig.[fig : sketchintro ] ( c ) .",
    "the obtained interferometric signal not only depends on the phase accumulated when adiabatically moving within a single band but also on the phase picked up during the transition from one band to the other .",
    "experimentally band switching can be achieved by applying oscillating force at the frequency matching the band energy difference .",
    "we show that when applying this particular band switching protocol , a geometric phase for the bloch cycle is obtained , the winding of which ( over half the bz ) yields the @xmath0invariant .",
    "we also present an alternative approach based on measurements of the so - called wilson loops , which are essentially non - abelian generalizations of the zak phase .",
    "their eigenvalues are directly related to the @xmath0invariant , as was shown by yu et.al .",
    "the measurement of wilson loops requires moving atoms non adiabatically in the bz in two directions and relies on keeping track of two - band dynamics of atoms .",
    "we show how this can be achieved using currently available experimental techniques .",
    "other methods suggested to detect topological properties of cold atom systems mostly focused on detecting characteristic gapless edge states @xcite .",
    "even for typical smooth confinement potentials present in cold atom systems , theoretical analysis showed @xcite that these edge states should still be observable . to detect @xmath0topological phases of cold atoms , a spin - resolved version of optical bragg spectroscopy",
    "was suggested @xcite .",

    "we review different formulations of the @xmath0invariant in terms of simple zak phases , which are at the heart of our interferometric schemes . in section [ sec : adiabaticscheme ] the first of our two measurement schemes ( twist scheme ) is presented .",
    "the experimental realization of this scheme is discussed and we show that it can easily be implemented in the experimental setup proposed in @xcite . in section [ sec : wilsonscheme ] we present the wilson loop scheme and discuss its experimental feasibility .",
    "finally in section [ sec : summary ] we conclude and give an outlook how our scheme can easily be applied also to 3d topological insulators .",
    "in the following we will review how topological invariants can be formulated in terms of geometrical zak phases . after a short discussion of the chern number case",
    ", we move on to @xmath0invariants .",
    "this allows us to introduce the basic ideas of our measurement protocols .",
    "we start by discussing zak phases in 1d bloch bands .",
    "let us consider some eigenstate @xmath4 of a bloch hamiltonian @xmath5 which continuously depends on quasi momentum @xmath6 , and where @xmath6 is varied from @xmath7 to @xmath8 over some time @xmath9 .",
    "thereby the wavefunction generally picks up a dynamical phase that depends on @xmath9 as well as a _",
    "geometric _ phase which only depends on the path in momentum space @xcite .",
    "this so - called berry or zak phase is given by @xmath10 where the _ berry connection _ is defined as @xmath11    as mentioned in the introduction , zak phases of optical lattices have been measured using a combination of bloch oscillations and ramsey interferometry @xcite .    for later purposes we will now shortly discuss the issue of dynamical phases , which read @xmath12 here",
    "@xmath13 is the band energy .",
    "one can always get rid of dynamical phases by driving bloch oscillations extremely fast ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , as long as non - adiabatic transition are prohibited by a sufficiently large energy gap to other bands .      to understand how zak phases of 1d systems constitute topological invariants in higher dimensions , we start by reviewing the chern number case . to this end",
    "we note that there is a fundamental relation between the zak phase and the polarization @xmath15 of a 1d system @xcite , @xmath16 here @xmath17 denotes the wannier function of band @xmath18 localized at lattice site @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the position operator in units of the lattice constant @xmath21 .",
    "the chern number ( @xmath22 ) describes the hall response of a filled band , which is quantized at integer multiples of @xmath23 , @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes an electric field along @xmath26-direction and @xmath27 the perpendicular hall current density along @xmath28-direction .",
    "since the electric field @xmath25 leads to transport of electrons ( or atoms ) along @xmath1 through the bz , the corresponding current density @xmath27 perpendicular to the field is related to the change of polarization @xmath29 ( polarization is measured in @xmath28-direction as in eq . ) .",
    ", one easily derives from this simple physical consideration the well - known relation between zak phases and the chern number ( see @xcite for review ) @xmath30 a more detailed discussion of this argument can be found in appendix [ sec : apdx : zakchern ] .    a simple physical picture illustrating eq . is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : wanniercenters ] ( a ) following @xcite . there",
    "the wannier centers ( i.e. the polarizations @xmath31 of the wannier functions at different sites @xmath32 ) are shown as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the case when a wannier center reconnects with its @xmath33th nearest neighbor after going from @xmath34 to @xmath35 corresponds to a non - trivial chern number of @xmath36 .",
    "relation indicates that the chern number can be measured in an optical lattice by measuring the gradient of the zak phase @xcite .",
    "the quantum spin hall phase was constructed by kane and mele @xcite starting from two time reversed copies ( spin @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) of chern insulators realizing the quantum hall effect . since time - reversal inverts @xmath1 but not @xmath28 , the wannier centers of the second spin are obtained from those in fig.[fig : wanniercenters ] ( a ) by reflecting on the @xmath28-axis , see fig.[fig : wanniercenters ] ( b ) .",
    "consequently the chern numbers have opposite signs and cancel to give a vanishing total chern number .",
    "the underlying topology of the system however can be classified by the _ difference _ of the two chern numbers , @xmath39    in the generic case with soc mixing the spins @xmath40 , spin is no longer a good quantum number and two bands labeled @xmath41 emerge . as a consequence of tr symmetry they are related by @xmath42 here",

    "fu and kane pointed out in @xcite that , like the chern number , @xmath49 can be understood from the topology of the wannier centers . to see how this works ,",
    "let us first discuss a generic tr invariant band structure as it is sketched in fig.[fig : sketchintro ] ( c ) .",
    "tr invariance requires the bloch hamiltonian @xmath50 to fulfill @xmath51 as a consequence there are two 1d subsystems at fixed @xmath52 ( referred to as time - reversal invariant momenta , trim ) which are tr invariant _ as 1d systems _ , i.e. @xmath53 . within these two 1d systems",
    "there are in total four momenta @xmath54 ( also referred to as trim ) where the bloch hamiltonian is tr invariant itself , @xmath55 .    at these four points kramers theorem",
    "requires eigenvalues to come in degenerate pairs .",

    "cuts through such a generic band structure are sketched in fig.[fig : ad&twist ] . in principle",
    "there can be additional accidental degeneracies of the two bands @xmath57 .",
    "however in the rest of the paper we will restrict ourselves to the simpler case without any further degeneracies besides the four kramers degeneracies .",
    "[ fig : wanniercenters ] ( c ) illustrates the corresponding wannier centers for a generic  but topologically non - trivial  case .",
    "the underlying tr symmetry requires wannier centers to come in _",
    "kramers pairs _ at trim @xmath58 , again as a consequence of kramers theorem .",
    "when these kramers pairs switch partners upon going from @xmath59 to @xmath35 the system is topologically non - trivial , while it is trivial otherwise @xcite .    using the change of polarizations of the two states @xmath60 as indicated in fig.[fig : wanniercenters ] ( c ) , we see that the topology is described by the integer invariant @xmath61 .",
    "fu and kane @xcite coined the name _ time - reversal polarization _ ( trp ) for the quantity @xmath62 using their language , the @xmath0invariant is given by the change of trp over half the bz , i.e. @xmath63 a more detailed , pedagogical derivation of this formula can be found in the appendix [ sec : apdx : ztandtrp ] .",
    "naively one might think that , with the formulation of @xmath49 eq . entirely in terms of polarizations ( i.e. due to in terms of zak phases ) , we have an interferometric scheme at hand . according to eqs .",
    ", one would only have to measure the difference of zak phases @xmath64 at @xmath59 and @xmath65 at @xmath35 and repeat the protocol for the second band @xmath48 .",
    "zak phases , however , can only be measured up to @xmath66 .",
    "typically the problem of @xmath66 ambiguities of zak phases can be circumvented by rewriting their _ difference _ as a _ winding _ over some continuous parameter .",
    "as pointed out above , this strategy works out for the case of chern numbers , see eq ..    however we can not simply replace the change @xmath67 of trp by its winding @xmath68 , because trp _ is not continuous over the bz_. this discontinuity is a direct consequence of kramers degeneracies : let us consider the zak phase @xmath64 at @xmath69 , see fig.[fig : ad&twist ] ( a ) . according to eqs .",
    ", @xmath64 is determined by the berry connection @xmath70 within band @xmath47 ( note that band @xmath47 crosses band @xmath48 at the two kramers degeneracies . )",
    "now let us imagine going to some slightly larger @xmath71 and measure the zak phase of band @xmath47 here , see fig.[fig : ad&twist ] ( b ) .",
    "because there is no longer any true band crossing , we now always have to follow the energetically upper band .",
    "this means however , that the zak phase @xmath72 is determined by the berry connection @xmath73 from @xmath74 and by @xmath75 ( note the exchanged index ! ) from @xmath76 . to be continuous on the small patch",

    "let us add that as a consequence of the discontinuity of trp , the meaning of wannier centers in fig.[fig : wanniercenters ] ( b)-(d ) has to be taken with care .",
    "what is shown is a non - abelian generalization of simple zak phases , as will be discussed in detail at the end of sec.[subsubsec : wilsonvstrp ] .",
    "the basic idea of our first ( out of two ) interferometric scheme for the measurement of the @xmath0invariant is to circumvent the discontinuity of trp discussed above , while keeping all bloch oscillations completely adiabatic .",
    "to do so , we want to add band switchings at the end and in the middle of the sequence . then close to the kramers degeneracy at @xmath80 , instead of staying in the energetically upper band @xmath47",
    ", atoms will be transferred to the energetically lower band @xmath48 .",
    "these band switchings correspond to applying ramsey @xmath81 pulses , as indicated in fig.[fig : ad&twist](b ) .",
    "after finishing the entire bloch cycle and applying a second ramsey @xmath81-pulse , the atoms will finally return to the band they initially started from .",
    "the two possible _ twisted _ paths through energy - momentum space will be labeled @xmath82 and @xmath83 and they are illustrated in fig.[fig : ad&twist ] .",
    "path @xmath82 corresponds to atoms starting in band @xmath47 , while @xmath83 corresponds to atoms starting in @xmath48 .    in this process atoms",
    "pick up geometrical zak phases @xmath84 .",
    "we will refer to these as _ twisted _ zak phases , because they consist of zak phases from the movement within bands @xmath41 as well as additional geometric phases from the ramsey @xmath81-pulses . the key idea of the _ twist scheme _ is to measure these twisted zak phases .",
    "we note that for tr invariant @xmath85 no band switchings are required and twisted zak phases coincide with their conventional counterparts , @xmath86 moreover we will see that twisted zak phases @xmath87 are _ continuous _ as a function of @xmath1 ; this is because we added band switchings by hand right where conventional zak phases fail to follow the desired path .",
    "like all geometric phases , twisted zak phases are by definition gauge invariant up to integer multiples of @xmath66 .",

    "( known as the tr constraint @xcite ) . in this gauge",

    "the second term is the winding of the _ total zak phase _ , @xmath125 across _ half _ the bz . importantly , unlike trp , the total zak phase is _ continuous _ throughout the bz because the _ sum _ of zak phases appears .",

    "the measurement of the @xmath0invariant requires _ non - abelian _ bloch oscillations ( i.e. some form of band switchings ) and makes the interferometric protocol more involved .",
    "our first scheme ( `` twist scheme '' ) uses the fact that the @xmath0invariant is the difference of time - reversal polarization at @xmath404 and @xmath405 , which itself is a difference of zak phases .",

    "such ramsey pulses can easily be realized by shaking the optical lattice and using the coupling of the bands through non - abelian berry connections .",

    "our scheme is readily applicable in the suggested experimental setup @xcite .",
    "most importantly , it does not require any additional degrees of freedom to perform ramsey interferometry .",
    "the second scheme (  wilson loop scheme  ) uses a formulation of the @xmath0invariant in terms of non - abelian wilson loops .",
    "in particular our protocol relies on an expression which involves eigenvalues of wilson loops along with total zak phases , @xmath407    the _ wilson loop phase _ @xmath123 is the difference of polarizations at @xmath35 and @xmath59 .",
    "we showed that to measure the polarization of a band at time - reversal invariant momentum @xmath1 , the existence of the second ( partly degenerate ) kramers partner can be ignored .",
    "this is a direct consequence of tr symmetry .",
    "secondly the winding @xmath408 of the _ total zak phase _ is required .",
    "the total zak phase is the _ sum _ of the zak phases of the two kramers partners and therefore continuous throughout the bz .",
    "when the bands are separated by a sufficiently large energy gap they can be measured independently , but we also showed how one can still reliably measure their sum when abelian bloch oscillations are not applicable e.g. due to accidental degeneracies .",
    "the experimental realization of the wilson loop scheme requires a second copy of the quantum spin hall effect that can independently be controlled , making it harder to implement in some of the existing proposals .    although for the formulation of the two protocols we restricted ourselves to two spatial dimensions , our scheme is applicable to 3d tr invariant topological insulators as well .",
    "the reason is that the 3d @xmath0invariants ( one strong and three weak ones ) can be expressed as products of 2d @xmath0invariants corresponding to specific 2d planes within the 3d brillouin zone @xcite ( see appendix [ subsec:3dtis ] ) .",
