    "for carbon dioxide ( co@xmath0 ) , being an important industrial chemical , numerous interaction potentials ( ips ) have been proposed , surpassed perhaps only by water in the amount of computer attention it has attracted among the molecular models .",
    "there are the parametric fits to the _ ab initio _ potential energy surface of the dimer , such as the the ips of steinebrunner and coworkers,@xcite of bukowski and colleagues,@xcite and of bock _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the most successful and widely used ips , however , have been fitted against bulk properties known from observation , such as the vapor - liquid equilibrium @xcite ( vle ) or the crystal lattice parameters @xcite , and still others against experimental properties of the dilute gas , such as the second virial coefficient .",
    "@xcite one may ask why this is so , but the _ ab initio _ ips employ a great number of fitting parameters , not always of clear physical origin and , even so , interfacing them with other ips , for instance when studying mixtures , is technically difficult because suitable combining equations are not known for the many parameters .",
    "moreover , this problem is not unique to the _ ab initio _ ips : also some empirical ips use truncated series expansions @xcite for both angular and radial functions in a way which makes it difficult to interface them with ips of radial site - site interactions .",
    "hence , such ips can find little use outside simulations of the neat liquid . on the other hand ,",
    "great success has been enjoyed by the simple site - site interaction formula of one lennard - jones interaction center , and one atomic point charge , centered on every atomic site@xcite . restricting ourselves to the rigid models ,",
    "these can all be regarded as descendants of the original@xcite ip due to murthy , singer and macdonald ( msm ) .",
    "these ips have the very appealing property that they can be readily interfaced ( `` mixed '' ) with existing force fields , many of which share the exact same mathematical form .",
    "nature is not kind enough , however , to allow such a simplified description of the co@xmath0 molecule at no cost . even though very good experimental agreement for a wide variety of properties is obtained by the simple , rigid model with three lennard - jones centers and one point quadrupole developed by merker _",
    "et al._,@xcite like the epm-2 model,@xcite it suffers from experimental disagreement in more `` basic '' properties such as the carbon - oxygen bond distance . with respect to the vle envelope , the most successful such simple msm - type model to date is the ip due to zhang and duan @xcite ( zd ) .",
    "nevertheless , despite its high accuracy in this property , i report in this note that the microstructure of the dimer , and the temperature dependence of the second , @xmath1 , and third , @xmath2 , virial coefficients are of much poorer quality .",
    "it should be pointed out , also , that the results presented in ref .",
    "have been called into question.@xcite    one striking omission from the published co@xmath0 ips is that of many - body effects . that the co@xmath0 molecule lacks",
    "an electric dipole moment may have dissuaded investigators from looking in this direction , but in the work leading up to this research note , extensive trials indicated that it is not possible with a non - polarizable ip of msm - type to simultaneously fit @xmath1 while keeping the experimental agreement of the vle envelope , at least not if the experimental bond distance and electric quadrupole moment are to be kept intact .",
    "the decision was then made in favor of a polarizable ip , to be described in this note , but the extra cost that the high - resolution solution of the electric field equations incurs , even for a single polarization site , make simulations of the vapor - liquid coexistence prohibitively expensive for parametrization purposes . instead",
    ", the temperature - dependence of the fluid density at 200 bar was used as a test for the many - body ( concentrated phase ) and @xmath1 for the two - body ( dilute phase ) properties .",
    "further developments then introduced a three - body dispersion interaction of axilrod - teller type,@xcite and @xmath2 as a parametrization target . as a test of the validity of the ip , numerous other properties are calculated without input into the parametrization procedure .",
    "the model introduced in this work goes by the moniker of gaussian charge polarizable carbon dioxide ( gcpcdo ) . this is because of its great similarity to the highly successful gcpm water @xcite from which it borrows most of the essential equations",
    "this note is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec1 ] a description of the mathematical form of the ip is given , and also the details of the calculations and the targeted properties of the parametrization .",
    "then in section [ sec2 ] , the results are presented and discussed .",
    "finally , a brief recapitulation of the main points is given in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we compute the interaction between partial charge @xmath3 and partial charge @xmath4 at a separation of @xmath5 , through the formula @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a function that assures that the electrostatic interactions remain finite at all separations ; for large @xmath5 it approaches unity .",
    "physically , this corresponds to charges distributed over a finite volume in space and like this we avoid the singularity of the potential at zero charge separation . for point charges , @xmath8 is identical to unity and eq .",
    "( [ eq : chgenergy ] ) reduces to the classical coulomb law . we choose the following form for the @xmath8-function , @xmath9 which corresponds the physical case of two gaussian charge distributions of standard deviations @xmath10 and @xmath11 interacting with each other.@xcite for now",
    ", we shall not concern ourselves with the general case of many - body interaction , as given by both `` static '' and `` dynamic '' electron correlation , but exclusively take care of that `` static '' correlation from the average electric field around each molecule , _",
    "i. e. _ electronic induction effects .",
    "furthermore , we do not carry this analysis beyond the dipole induction , _",
    "i. e. _ we consider only the gradient of the electric potential .",
    "an induced dipole is hence positioned at the center of mass of molecule @xmath12 and is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electrostatic field at that point , @xmath15 the polarizability perpendicular to the molecular axis and @xmath16 that parallel to the same . both @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are known from theory @xcite and their average agree in magnitude with that ascertained in experiment , @xcite but the interpolation between them has been chosen merely for convenience .",
    "@xmath17 is the angle between the molecular axis and the direction of @xmath14 , the electric field at site @xmath12 .",
    "because of the uncertainty in the precise form of the polarization matrix , and the approximations involved with the rigid rotor , the polarizabilities have been rounded to only two significant digits . in its turn ,",
    "the electric field is computed as the sum of the contributions due to the permanent charges and that due to the other induced dipoles , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electric field at the center of molecule @xmath20 due to the all the charges on the other molecules , and @xmath21 is the electric field at the same point , but due to all the other induced dipoles .",
    "these are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 where the tensor @xmath24 is obtained from the hessian of equation ( [ eq : chgenergy ] ) , with ",
    "following paricaud _",
    "@xcite  the charge width parameter of the molecular center equal to that of the center atom .",
    "if the dipoles are converged , the extra energy of interaction due to the polarization is given by , @xcite @xmath25      first of all , the modified buckingham exp-6 potential is adopted between atoms @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28\\ ] ] this represents the pairwise additive part of the dispersion interaction as well as the steric repulsion between atoms . also for this interaction , a hard - core is introduced at @xmath29 to avoid the spurious behavior of this potential at short range .",
    "this is the same hard - core cutoff used by paricaud and coworkers @xcite in the gcpm water model .",
    "investigations indicated that the results are not very sensitive to the shortening of this hard - core radius to @xmath30 , but the speed of simulation is . here",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are atomic interaction parameters , related to the well - depth , steepness and position , respectively , of the dispersion interaction .",
    "second , a modified axilrod - teller term is added for all molecular triples .",
    "this is the triple - dipole dispersion correction to the van der waals interaction which was first published by axilrod and teller .",
    "@xcite in the derivation by axilrod,@xcite spherical polarizabilities are assumed , but for anisotropically polarizable molecules , such as co@xmath0 , his result does not hold . to investigate this case ,",
    "we quickly recapitulate axilrod s derivation@xcite where we dispose of the assumption of spherical polarizabilities .    for each of the three molecules @xmath12 , @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we define a local coordinate system where the @xmath36-axis is normal to the plane of the molecular centers , the @xmath37-axis parallel to the bisector of the angle spanned by the two other molecules and the @xmath38-axis mutually orthogonal to the @xmath37- and @xmath36-axes .",
    "hence , the @xmath36-axes all coincide between the three local coordinate systems , but the @xmath37- and @xmath38-axes need not .",
    "assume now that the electronic structure of each molecule is independent and described by a wavefunction that factorizes into separable @xmath37- , @xmath38- and @xmath36-contributions in its local coordinate system , _",
    "i. e. _ for molecule @xmath12 , @xmath39 we write the third - order perturbation correction to the groundstate energy , @xmath40 , which in axilrod s notation is ( eq .  [ 5a ] in ref .  ) , @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the matrix element of the dipole perturbation for states @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the energy of state @xmath43 . invoking the closure approximation , @xcite this equation may be approximately recast as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 signifies the arithmetic average over @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "( [ pert ] ) serves to define the three - body correction to the dispersion energy that we will use .",
    "formally , the set of matrix elements @xmath49 covers all possible excited states but we shall assume contributions to the sum only from the first excited orbital of each symmetry for each molecule .",
    "that is , the three lowest excited states of the arbitrary molecule @xmath12 are assumed to be @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 where the asterisk denotes the next higher - energy orbital .",
    "because they share a common orthogonal @xmath36-axis , only mixed excited states for @xmath37- and @xmath38- components between the molecules contribute to the sum over states .",
    "hence , the matrix elements for the sequences of possible excitations are exhaustively given in table i of ref .   and",
    "the explicit form of these matrix elements is provided in eq .",
    "( 29 ) of the same reference , except that the common factor @xmath53 is no longer applicable because the transition diople moment is no longer the same for the different components . instead , given the two molecules @xmath12 and @xmath34 , excited in their @xmath37 and @xmath38 orbitals , respectively , we write the corresponding matrix element ( _ cf . _ eq .",
    "[ 29 ] in ref .  )",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the expectation value of transition dipole moment along the @xmath37-axis of molecule @xmath34 and @xmath56 the angle defined by the molecules @xmath57 and @xmath35 with its the apex in molecule @xmath34 .",
    "all the other matrix elements follow by analogy with ref .  .",
    "we have written eq .",
    "( [ eq : matel ] ) in a general form with @xmath58 being the permittivity of the medium in which the molecules are dispersed .",
    "it is most reasonable to take this as the permittivity of free space . since because of the very short - range nature of the interaction ( it tapers off as the inverse ninth power of distance ) it is unreasonable to assume that a homogeneous medium of co@xmath0 molecules can be accommodated between the interacting molecules .",
    "the final approximation is to replace the @xmath59-factors by the square - root of the corresponding polarizabilities . collecting the constants of proportionality in the common prefactor of eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) , which is then seen to have dimensions of reciprocal energy , we treat it as a fitting parameter and denote it by @xmath60 proper .    with anisotropic polarizabilities , the sum over states in eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) does not simplify to the simple form given in the original references @xcite and the complicated closed - form expression will not be reproduced here . in any case , since it involves sines and cosines it is not optimal from a computational point of view ; it is much more efficient in terms of the total number of floating - point operations to calculate the truncated sum over states directly . to this end",
    ", the half - angle formulas are used to rewrite the matrix elements , such as the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matel ] ) , in terms of dot products and square - roots , which are much more efficient in terms of cpu cycles than trigonometric functions .",
    "the polarizabilities are calculated , like before , as the interpolation @xmath61 where @xmath17 is , once again , the angle to the molecular axis .",
    "the limiting polarizabilities are taken to be the same as the static ones .    in total , after self - consistent solution of the induced dipoles , the energy of interaction among @xmath62 molecules is given by @xmath63 the analytical gradient of this expression is very involved , with the chain - rule giving factors proportional to the gradient of the polarizability .",
    "consequently , when the gradient has been needed , for instance , in energy minimization , it has been calculated numerically using the finite - difference approximation .",
    "a number of parameters have not been optimized , but simply assigned from plausible experimental values in the literature .",
    "thus , the bond length is fixed at 1.161  , midway between published values of 1.160   and 1.162   by experimental groups,@xcite and the partial charges on the atoms are chosen to reproduce the experimental quadrupole moment.@xcite to further reduce the number of free parameters , the charge width of the oxygen atom , @xmath64 , was set equal to 0.610  , the value of the oxygen atom in gcpm water , @xcite and , the corresponding quantity for carbon was scaled according to the ratio of the @xmath65 parameters ( _ vide infra _ ) .",
    "these parameters were not optimized .",
    "moreover , i introduced the additional constraint of @xmath66 and for the remaining parameters , the following `` mixing rules '' were adopted for unlike interactions of the modified buckingham exp-6 potential , @xmath67 eq .  ( [ eqn : mix1 ] ) can be justified with appeal to the london formula,@xcite in which the harmonic average of the ionization energy is taken .",
    "normally , it is the geometric average of the polarizabilities in said equation that lends its mathematical form to the combining rule for the @xmath68-parameters .",
    "however , the precise form of the mixing rules are of a secondary concern , as they serve mainly to reduce the parameter space that has to be fit , and provided the atomic interaction parameters do not turn out to be very different from each other , the result will be insensitive to reasonable choices of mixing rules .",
    "a test set of potentials with predefined @xmath65 values , covering a broad range , but with the ratio , @xmath69 of the carbon sigma value , @xmath70 , and the oxygen sigma value , @xmath71 , conserved at @xmath72 were investigated .",
    "this value was arbitrarily chosen early in the development of the model and never subjected to revision . for each such class of ips , manual tuning of the @xmath68-parameters in trial - and - error fashion was made to obtain a good fit for @xmath1 against experimental data and a reasonable binding energy and geometry of the dimer structure .",
    "@xmath1 was calculated from the mayer sampling method @xcite over @xmath73 monte carlo steps .",
    "typically , with this number of monte carlo steps , the resulting uncertainty , calculated from the block average method @xcite with blocks of @xmath74 cycles , is of the order of one percent .",
    "the induced dipoles were iteratively solved to within a tolerance of @xmath75 d at all times . in the course of this parametrization , it was found that the @xmath76-parameter plays a most crucial role .",
    "this parameter controls the steepness of the modified buckingham potential , without affecting well depth or location .",
    "small values lead to a flat minimum and @xmath1 turned out to be very sensitive to this parameter .",
    "thus , it was found that , to fit @xmath1 , this parameter had to be increased from its initial estimate of 12.75 ( taken from gcpm water @xcite ) to 15.50 .",
    "later in the development of the model , it was found necessary , with respect to the liquid densities , to include also the three - body dispersion in the energy expression . because the @xmath77-parameter is completely independent of all dimer properties , including @xmath1 , it was fitted independently so that @xmath2 coincided with the data of dushek _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite it was not possible to reproduce , with this single parameter , also the data of holste _",
    "et al._,@xcite something which lends credence to the former measurements .",
    "the value obtained , @xmath78 k , is reasonable in that it is of the same order of magnitude as the axilrod - teller coefficient obtained for argon , for which this coefficient is @xmath79 k in the appropriate units.@xcite      the fluid densities were extracted from isothermal - isobaric metropolis monte carlo simulations @xcite for an ensemble of 200 molecules in periodic boundary conditions of cubic symmetry over @xmath80 steps , run in parallel over five independent markov chains .",
    "standard errors of the mean were estimated from the block average method @xcite with @xmath81 blocks .    for the modified buckingham potential , with neglect of interactions beyond the cutoff",
    "the energy was corrected by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and superscripts indicate between which two atom types the interaction is computed . here",
    "@xmath84 is the number density of molecules .",
    "the integral in question can be analytically computed , which yields @xmath85\\ ] ] for the axilrod - teller terms , in light of their very strong distance dependence , no long - range correction was deemed necessary .    for the electrostatic interaction ,",
    "a long - range correction was introduced for the induced dipole using the onsager expression for the dipole reaction field@xcite with the dielectric constant taken from the clausius - mosotti equation fitted against experimental measurements of the dielectric constant.@xcite this may seem to be very approximate but was done for two principal reasons .",
    "first , lattice summation techniques such as the ewald sum @xcite introduce assumptions of periodicity which are unsuitable for the uncorrelated nature of the molecules in a disordered phase .",
    "second , the quadrupolar interaction terms decay sufficiently fast with distance so as to make their sum absolutely convergent . on the assumption of uncorrelated molecules beyond the cutoff radius ,",
    "the long - range correction vanishes .",
    "last but not least , the exact same procedure was used by paricaud _",
    "_ in their simulations of gcpm water.@xcite as a technical side - note",
    ", it should be pointed out that ewald summation for gaussian charges is complicated by the fact that the required fourier transform for the reciprocal space sum is not analytically tractable .",
    "using the reciprocal space sum for point charges , with due corrections in direct space and a long cutoff radius , is an alternative but inefficient .",
    "each trial move consisted of randomly displacing and rotating from one up to four molecules .",
    "interaction cutoffs were introduced at half the box length .",
    "for the three - body dispersion , this was interpreted to mean that all interacting molecules had to be within cutoff of each other .",
    "simple mixing @xcite with a mixing factor of 10% was used to enforce and speed convergence . because of increased computational load , the induced dipoles were solved to within a tolerance of @xmath86 d per molecule .",
    "this is still less tolerant than many other reported simulations of polarizable ips : ren and ponder @xcite report simulations on liquid water with their amoeba force field where the dipoles are solved to within @xmath87 d precision ; paricaud _ et al._.@xcite solve the induced dipoles to within @xmath88 d in their simulations of gcpm water .",
    "however , further relaxation of the tolerance is unnecessary as the greater part of the simulation time is not spent on the self - consistent solution of the elctrostatic field equations , but ( about 70% ) on the evaluation of @xmath89 .",
    "this computation can be significantly sped up with shorter interaction cutoffs .",
    "two types of bulk simulations were performed .",
    "a series of @xmath90-simulations to determine the density and constant - pressure heat capacity of the model fluid and @xmath91-simulations to determine the radial distribution functions of the model fluid .",
    "together with the calculation of the virial coefficients , these served to parametrize the model . all parameters except for @xmath77",
    "were decided for the potential model lacking the @xmath92 term , which has no effect on either the dimer binding energy , its geometry or the second virial coefficient .",
    "selection among candidates of this pairwise dispersion model was effected by comparing densities from the @xmath90-simulation with experiment , although the long - range correction was not fully developed at this time .",
    "subsequent introduction of the long - range correction lead to an increase of the computed densities , later corrected by the introduction of the three - body dispersion interaction .",
    "the final parameters , extracted from these tests , are listed in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "[ tab : param ]    .interaction parameters and experimental observables for the gcpcdo model and , where appropriate , experimental reference values . [ cols=\"^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     despite this small short - coming of the predictions for the complex , it is still worthwhile to consider the complex , also studied by danten and coworkers,@xcite because here the true many - body interactions start to play a role . moreover ,",
    "contrary to the case of the co@xmath0 trimer , where none of the moieties is dipolar , the water molecule carries a substantial dipole moment and the electronic induction effects are expected to be more pronounced .",
    "it must be pointed out that despite this being a three - body system , no axilrod - teller potential has been applied .",
    "the reason is that while gcpm water has a known polarizability , it has no axilrod - teller coefficient . rather than impose one on the model ,",
    "i have decided to judge it fairly according to its own merits , and these exclude a three - body dispersion interaction .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab : cmplx2 ] .",
    "the agreement is very good in terms of energy .",
    "contrary to the complex , for the complex , there is no appreciable underestimation of the binding energy .",
    "this can probably be attributed to the larger fraction of co@xmath0-co@xmath0 interactions in this complex . moreover , both danten _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and i find that the minimum is of @xmath93 symmetry , but for the zd@xcite / tip3p@xcite model , the global minimum is of @xmath94 symmetry in a conformation reminiscent of the @xmath94 trimer .",
    "a local minimum of @xmath94 symmetry is predicted by the gcpcdo / gcpm@xcite model at about @xmath95 k above the global minimum . clearly , polarization changes the relative stability of these two conformations in favor of the @xmath93 one and this is captured both by the mp2 calculations of danten _",
    "_ @xcite and by the present work .",
    "the peculiarities of the global minima predicted by the ips are given in table [ tab : cmplx2 ] .",
    "it is very clear that the many - body effects are responsible for the altered symmetry of the equilibrium structure .",
    "also , the binding energy is vastly overestimated by the non - polarizable ip pair .",
    "a new , polarizable ip for co@xmath0 has been introduced and shown to be in excellent agreement dimer properties and excellent - to - passable agreement for the bulk phase .",
    "classical non - polarizable ips that reproduce bulk phase properties well have been shown inadequate for the description of @xmath1 and also @xmath2 . that many - body effects should not be ignored for the co@xmath0 molecule is evidenced by the qualitative experimental agreement that is achieved for the stability of the two trimer conformations , something which not even the _ ab initio _ potential energy surface of bukowski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite manages .",
    "further corroboration of the model is provided by calculations on the water complexes , where especially the complex is in good agreement with _",
    "ab initio _ calculation at the mp2/cc - aug - pvtz level of theory.@xcite absence of polarization changes the symmetry of this complex .",
    "a tough test for all of the molecular co@xmath0 potentials investigated is the prediction of the virial coefficients .",
    "the gcpcdo model handles @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but only because of design , and fails at @xmath96 and up .",
    "this can still be considered an improvement over the classical , non - polarizable models for which most probably none of the virial coefficients beyond the ideal gas term are in agreement with experiment .",
    "clearly , the interaction among co@xmath0 molecules is more complicated than a simple pairwise sum over atomic charges and lennard - jones terms .",
    "however , it is also more complicated than self - consistent solution of induced dipoles and triple - dipole dispersion interaction",
    ". nevertheless , for systems of three bodies or less , it seems to be highly satisfactory , meaning that the remaining errors relate to many - body effects beyond the third . on the precise causes of the remaining errors in the ip",
    "can only be speculated and future computer experiments may provide the answer to what the mechanisms are .",
    "it is in this light that it must be kept in mind that even if in comparison with experiment , the gcpcdo model , with a few exceptions , rests more on qualitative concordance than on many digits of precision , this is the first many - body molecular ip for the co@xmath0 molecule to be developed and that many areas of inquiry remain to explore .",
    "one obvious and immediate improvement to the model would be to distribute the induced dipole over all atoms for a better short - range description of the induced electrostatics .",
    "the simulations were performed on the c3se computing resources .",

    "<S> density of the fluid at 200 and 800 bars pressure is reproduced to within some percent of observation over the temperature range 250 k to 310 k. the dimer structure is in passable agreement with electronically resolved quantum - mechanical calculations in the literature , as are those of the monohydrated monomer and dimer complexes using the polarizable gcpm water potential . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative agreement with experiment is also obtained , when quantum corrections are included , for the relative stability of the trimer conformations , which is not the case for the pair potentials . </S>"
