    "the na49 collaboration has recently performed a series of measurements of pb - pb collisions at 20 , 30 , 40 , 80 and 158 @xmath1 gev beam energies @xcite . combining these results with measurements at lower beam energies from the ags  @xcite",
    "they reveal a sharp variation with beam energy in the @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and in the k@xmath0 ratios . such a strong variation with energy does not occur in pp collisions and therefore indicates a major difference in heavy - ion interactions .",
    "a strong variation with energy of the @xmath9 ratio has been predicted on the basis of arguments put forward in  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that this might be a signal of the critical point in the qcd phase diagram at high baryon density .    in this paper",
    "we explore another , less spectacular , possibility for the sharp maximum .",
    "the arguments for this will be presented in two steps . in step ( i ) the statistical model of a hadron gas is studied . for this purpose ,",
    "we investigate various quantities along the freeze - out curve  @xcite as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "it is shown that the entropy of the hadronic gas is dominated at the lower energies by baryons and at the higher ones by mesons .",
    "the transition occurs just at the energy where the sharp maximum has been observed . in step ( ii )",
    "we speculate whether at these incident energies the freeze - out might happen earlier .",
    "the consequences are discussed and arguments based on hbt results are presented to support this idea .",
    "the experimental data from heavy - ion collisions show that the k@xmath0 ratio rises from sis up to ags .",
    "it is larger for ags than at the highest cern - sps energies @xcite and decreases even further at rhic @xcite .",
    "this behavior is of particular interest as it could signal the appearance of new dynamics for strangeness production in high - energy collisions .",
    "it was even conjectured that this property could indicate an energy threshold for quark - gluon - plasma formation in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we analyze the energy dependence of strange to non - strange particle ratios in the framework of a hadronic statistical model . in the whole energy range ,",
    "the hadronic yields observed in heavy - ion collisions resemble a system in chemical equilibrium characterized by two parameters , the temperature @xmath2 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "these two parameters define the `` freeze - out curve '' which seems determined by the condition of fixed average energy / particle @xmath11 1 gev @xcite . as the beam energy increases in the energy domain of sis and ags , @xmath2 rises and",
    "@xmath3 decreases slightly .",
    "above ags energies , @xmath2 exhibits only a moderate change and converges to its maximal value in the range of 160 to 180 mev , while @xmath3 is strongly decreasing .    rather than studying the k@xmath0 ratio",
    ", we use the ratios of strange to non - strange particle multiplicities ( wroblewski factor )  @xcite defined as @xmath12 where the quantities in angular brackets refer to the number of newly formed quark - antiquark pairs , i.e.  it excludes all quarks that were present in the target and the projectile nuclei .    applying the statistical model to particle production in heavy - ion collisions",
    "calls for the use of the canonical ensemble to treat the number of strange particles , particularly for data in the energy range from sis up to ags @xcite .",
    "the calculations for au - au and pb - pb collisions are performed using a canonical correlation volume  @xcite .",
    "the quark content used in the wroblewski factor is determined at the moment of _ chemical freeze - out _ ,",
    "i.e.  from the hadrons and , especially , hadronic resonances before they decay .",
    "this ratio is thus not an easily measurable observable unless one can reconstruct all resonances from the final - state particles .",

    "1 we conclude that around @xmath4 = 8.2 gev corresponding to an incident energy of 30 @xmath1 gev , the relative strangeness content in heavy - ion collisions reaches a clear and well pronounced maximum .",
    "the wroblewski factor decreases towards higher energies and reaches a limiting value of about 0.43 .",
    "for details see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the appearance of the maximum can be traced to the specific dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 on the beam energy as also pointed out in ref .",
    "figure  1 ( right ) shows lines of constant @xmath13 in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "as expected , @xmath13 rises with increasing @xmath2 for fixed @xmath3 . following the chemical freeze - out curve , shown as a dashed line in fig .  1",
    ", one can see that @xmath13 rises quickly from sis to ags energies , then reaches a maximum at @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev .",
    "these freeze - out parameters correspond to 30 @xmath1 gev laboratory energy . at higher incident energies",
    "the increase in @xmath2 becomes negligible but @xmath3 keeps on decreasing and as a consequence @xmath13 also decreases .",
    "the importance of finite baryon density on the behavior of @xmath13 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 left , showing separately the contributions to @xmath17 coming from strange baryons , from strange mesons and from hidden strangeness , i.e.  from hadrons like @xmath18 and @xmath19 . as can be seen in fig .  1",
    ", the origin of the maximum in the wroblewski ratio can be traced to the contribution of strange baryons .",
    "the production of strange baryons dominates at low @xmath4 and loses importance at high incident energies when the yield of strange mesons increases . however",
    ", strange mesons also exhibit a broad maximum .",
    "this is due to associated production of e.g.  kaons together with hyperons at the lower incident energies .",

    "as can be understood from the arguments above , the ratio @xmath21 exhibits the most pronounced maximum , k@xmath0 a weaker one and k@xmath5 has no maximum at all .",
    "it is worth noting that the maxima in the ratios for multi - strange baryons occur at ever higher beam energies .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ lambda_pi ] for the @xmath7 ratio which peaks at a higher value of the beam energy .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 also shows a ( very weak ) maximum , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ lambda_pi ] . the higher the strangeness content of the baryon , the higher in energy is the maximum .",
    "this behavior is due to a combination of the facts that the baryon chemical potential decreases rapidly with energy and the multi - strange baryons have successively higher thresholds .    it is to be expected that if these maxima do not all occur at the same temperature , i.e. at the same beam energy , then the case for a phase transition is not very strong .",
    "the observed behavior seems to be governed by properties of the hadron gas .",
    "more detailed experimental studies of multi - strange hadrons will allow the verification or disproval of the trends shown in this paper .",
    "it should be clear that the @xmath8 ratio is very broad and shallow and it will be difficult to find a maximum experimentally",
    ".    in general , the model gives a good description of the data .",
    "it shows a broad maximum in the k@xmath0 ratio while the data exhibit a sharp peak .",
    "the drop towards 158 @xmath1 gev is most pronounced when using 4@xmath22 yields as done in these figures .",
    "this decrease is less pronounced for midrapidity values  @xcite .",
    "while the statistical model can not explain the sharpness of the peak in the k@xmath0 ratio , there are nevertheless several phenomena giving rise to the rapid change which warrant a closer look at the model .     as a function of the beam energy as calculated in the statistical model using thermus  @xcite.,width=396 ]    [ entropy_s ]    to get a better estimate of the thermal parameters in the transition region we show in fig .",
    "[ entropy_s ] the entropy density as a function of beam energy following the freeze - out curve given in @xcite .",
    "the separate contribution of mesons and of baryons to the total entropy is also shown in this figure .",
    "there is a clear change of baryon to meson dominance around @xmath4 = 8.2 gev . above this value",
    "the entropy is carried mainly by mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is remarkable that the entropy density divided by @xmath23 is constant for all incident energies except for the low - energy region corresponding to the sis energy region .",
    "in this section , we explore the possibility that freeze - out might happen earlier in the transition region . for this interpretation",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ kp_pip_t_mub ] the calculated values of the k@xmath0 ratio for various combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as contour lines with the corresponding values given in the figure .",
    "the thick solid line reflects the locations of the freeze - out given by the condition of ref .",
    "if freeze - out happens around an incident energies of 30 @xmath1 gev at higher @xmath2 , then the ratio k@xmath0 will be higher .",
    "this ratio can never exceed a value of 0.25 in an equilibrium condition .",
    "ratio for combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given by the contour lines and the corresponding values .",
    "the thick line refers to the freeze - out curve  @xcite.,width=351 ]    [ kp_pip_t_mub ]    it turns out that other particle ratios are less affected by a different freeze - out scenario , as their variation in the @xmath14 plane is very different  @xcite .",
    "[ ceres ]    an early freeze - out is supported by results from hbt studies  @xcite .",
    "figure  5 shows the extracted volumina as a function of @xmath4 . between top ags and the lowest sps energies",
    "a minimum can be seen . as the fireball is expanding ,",
    "a smaller volume reflects an earlier time .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite relate this minimum to a change in the interaction from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "it has been shown that the statistical model yields a maximum in the relative strangeness content around 30 @xmath1 gev .",
    "this is due to a saturation in the temperature @xmath2 while the chemical potential keeps decreasing with incident energy .",
    "since the chemical potential plays a key role , it is clear that baryons are strongly affected .",
    "indeed , all hyperon/@xmath22 ratios yield maxima . in contrast",
    ", the k@xmath5 ratio shows a continuously rising curve as expected from the arguments above .",
    "the k@xmath0 ratio , however , exhibits a maximum , as k@xmath26 mesons are sensitive to the baryo - chemical potential due to their associate production with hyperons .",
    "the model predicts that for different hyperon/@xmath22 ratios the maxima occur at different energies .",
    "if experiments prove this , the case for a phase transition is strongly weakened .",
    "the energy regime around 30 @xmath1 gev seems to have specific properties .",
    "it is shown that the entropy production occurs below this energy mainly via creation of baryons , while at the higher incident energies meson production dominates .    in a third section , we speculated on the impact of a change in the freeze - out condition which might lead to an early freeze - out , thus deviating from the usual freeze - out condition .",
    "such a scenario would increase the k@xmath0 while leaving other particle ratios essentially unchanged .",
    "hbt studies show that around 30 @xmath1 gev a minimum in the extracted volumina occurs .",
    "this could be interpreted as an earlier kinetic freeze - out and might indicate also another freeze - out for chemical decoupling . +",
