    "a variety of different experiments ( some already operating , others in various stages of development ) are hoping to detect gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) from the early universe .",
    "in particular , at long wavelengths , cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) experiments @xcite will measure ( or tightly constrain ) the so - called tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 by searching for its characteristic `` @xmath14-mode '' imprint in the cmb polarization anisotropy @xcite . and on shorter wavelengths , various techniques",

    "arrays _ @xcite will reach far beyond the gravitational - wave sensitivity of individual pulsars . and at high frequencies",
    ", the sensitivity of ground - based gravitational - wave detectors ( and also the space - based mission lisa , if it is launched ) will surpass the so - called `` standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) bound '' by several orders of magnitude , and thus place genuinely new constraints on the primordial gravitational wave signal at high frequencies .    since primordial gravitational waves provide a rare and precious window onto the extremely - high - energy physics of the infant universe , it is essential to think carefully about the information that they carry .    in this paper",
    "we will present a general ( yet rather simple ) master equation ( [ master_eq ] ) connecting the long - wavelength observable @xmath0 to the short - wavelength observable @xmath1 .",
    "the goal is to clarify the relationship between gravitational - wave constraints at different wavelengths , and to highlight the important and unique information about the early universe that is encoded in this relationship .    what exactly _ do _ we learn , in general , by comparing long - wavelength constraints on @xmath0 and shorter - wavelength constraints on @xmath1 ?",
    "from the master equation ( [ master_eq ] ) , we will see that this type of comparison should be interpreted as primarily constraining two quantities , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which encode information about the early universe in a model - independent way .",
    "these two quantities are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ def_w_hat ] )  ( [ def_n_hat ] ) , and explained in detail in sec .  [ master_presentation ] . for",
    "now , let us briefly discuss their physical meaning : @xmath6 is the logarithmic average ( over a certain range of comoving wavenumber @xmath15 ) of the primordial tensor spectral index @xmath7 ; and @xmath5 is the logarithmic average ( over a certain range of the cosmological scale factor @xmath16 ) of the effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath8 in the early universe ( _ after _ horizon re - entry ) . here",
    "the _ effective _ equation - of - state parameter @xmath8 is a combination of the _ ordinary _ equation - of - state parameter @xmath9 and the bulk viscosity @xmath10 : see eq .",
    "( [ def_w_tilde ] ) .",
    "a key advantage of our current formulation in general ( and of the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in particular ) is that @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 may be arbitrary functions of @xmath16 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "so , in particular , we will _ not _",
    "take @xmath17 or @xmath18 to be constant ( or piecewise constant ) , as is often assumed in analytical treatments of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the point is that , when deriving eq .",
    "( [ master_eq ] ) , the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 naturally arise as the most direct and general encapsulation of the uncertain early - universe physics that enters into the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    as an application",
    ", we will stress that comparison @xmath0 and @xmath1 provides the most powerful way to constrain the equation - of - state parameter @xmath9 during the `` primordial dark age . ''",
    "here we use the phrase `` primordial dark age '' to refer to the epoch separating the end of inflation from the start of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . note that , on a logarithmic scale , this primordial dark age spans a large fraction of cosmic history : the energy scale of bbn is @xmath19 , while the energy scale at the end of inflation may exceed @xmath20 . and",
    "yet , although there is a standard _ theoretical _ picture of how the universe behaves during this early epoch , we currently have essentially no direct _ observational _ constraints .",
    "in fact , there are several reasons to be nervous about one of the key ( implicit ) assumptions in the standard picture of the primordial dark age : namely , the assumption that the equation - of - state satisfies @xmath21 . the first reason to worry is rather general : since the energy density of a cosmological matter component scales as @xmath22 , components with lower @xmath17 dilute more slowly .",
    "thus , just as an exotic component with @xmath17 sufficiently _ low _ will tend to dominate the cosmic energy budget at sufficiently _ late _ times ( think of `` dark energy '' with @xmath23 ) , an exotic component with @xmath17 sufficiently _ high _ ( call it `` stiff energy '' with @xmath24 ) will tend to dominate the cosmic energy budget at sufficiently _ early _ times ( see fig .",
    "[ scaling ] ) .     tend to dominate at earlier times .",
    "our universe may be dominated by a `` stiff energy '' component ( with @xmath12 ) prior to big bang nucleosynthesis ( but after inflation).,width=297 ]    indeed , as we look backward past bbn , the primordial dark age provides a huge window in which a stiff energy component might overtake radiation as the dominant component in the cosmic energy budget , without coming into conflict with any current observational constraints .",
    "it is also worth noting that there are perfectly sensible energy components with @xmath12 which might be present in the early universe .",
    "for example , a homogeneous scalar field @xmath25 with vanishing ( or negligible ) potential energy @xmath26 has @xmath27 ; and , in fact , supergravity and string theory seem to naturally predict many ( embarrassingly many ! ) scalar moduli fields with precisely this property .",
    "furthermore , various authors  @xcite have considered inflation models in which the inflaton field itself experiences a period of free ( @xmath27 ) evolution at the end of inflation ; or some other equation - of - state stiffer than radiation @xcite .",
    "`` stiff ( @xmath12 ) energy '' in the early universe may seem like an exotic possibility .",
    "but would the discovery of `` stiff energy '' at early times be any more surprising than our apparent discovery of `` dark energy '' at late times ?",
    "one lesson that we have learned from dark matter and dark energy is that the universe has an unmistakable penchant for new and unexpected energy components ; and it is important to check for these components observationally , if possible , rather than simply assuming that they are not there .",
    "we will stress that the comparison of constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 provides the best means for carrying out such a check .",
    "one of the most important results in this paper comes from considering the relationship between the cmb constraint on @xmath0 and the sbbn constraint on @xmath1 .",
    "if cmb polarization experiments succeed in detecting a non - zero value for the primordial tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 , this will be widely interpreted as providing evidence for inflation .",
    "but we show that , if these primordial tensor fluctuations are really generated by inflation , then ( in combination with the current sbbn constraint on @xmath28 ) , this will also imply an immediate and important supplementary result : namely a remarkably tight bound in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "this bound in the @xmath11 plane is derived in sec .",
    "[ bbn_constraints ] , and shown in fig .",
    "[ wntbbnfig ] .",
    "if cmb polarization experiments detect a non - zero value for @xmath0 , then the bound depicted in fig .",
    "[ wntbbnfig ] will be a qualitatively new piece of model - independent information about the early universe  which is very exciting , since such information is notoriously hard to obtain !",
    "one way to look at the bound is as follows : if we assume that the bulk viscosity @xmath10 is negligible after inflation , and also that the primordial tensor power spectrum @xmath29 is nearly flat ( which is a prediction of inflation ) , then we obtain an upper bound @xmath30 on the logarithmic average of the equation - of - state parameter @xmath9 during the primordial dark age separating the end of inflation from the bbn epoch .",
    "it is important to clarify the range of validity of our analysis .",
    "when we use @xmath1 in this paper , we are referring only to _ primordial _ gravitational waves  and , more specifically , only to those gravitational waves that were generated well _ before _ the corresponding comoving wavelength `` entered the hubble horizon '' ( _ i.e. _  became shorter than the instantaneous hubble length ) . apart from this restriction ,",
    "the results are quite general , and make no assumptions about the physical mechanism responsible for generating the gravitational waves .",
    "for example , our analysis applies to the primordial gravitational - wave spectrum generated during inflation ; and it applies equally well to the primordial gravitational - wave spectra generated by the `` pre - big - bang ''  @xcite and `` cyclic / ekpyrotic ''  @xcite alternatives to inflationary cosmology ; and , although all of the previous three examples ( inflationary , pre - big - bang , and ekpyrotic / cyclic cosmology ) generate primordial gravitational waves through the cosmological amplification of quantum fluctuations , our analysis would also apply to models that generate a primordial gravitational - waves via some completely different mechanism ( as long as they are generated _ prior _ to horizon entry ) . )",
    "specifically applies to standard inflation @xcite ( and _ not _ to pre - big - bang @xcite or ekpyrotic / cyclic @xcite models ) .",
    "but this is a very mild caveat , since eq .",
    "( [ f_end ] ) is used only in sec .",
    "[ bbn_constraints ] , which deals with models that produce a _ detectable _ value for @xmath0 ( which pre - big - bang and ekpyrotic / cyclic models do not @xcite ) . ] on the other hand , our analysis _ does not _ apply , _",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the results are summarized in figs .  2 , 3 and 4 .",

    "<S> @xmath0 is the so - called `` tensor - to - scalar ratio , '' which is constrained by cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) experiments ; and @xmath1 is the energy spectrum of primordial gravitational - waves , which is constrained _ e.g. _   by pulsar - timing ( pt ) measurements , laser - interferometer ( li ) experiments , and the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) bound . </S>",
    "<S> differentiating the master equation yields a new expression for the tilt @xmath4 of the present - day gravitational - wave spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early universe , and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated ( in a model - independent way ) by two quantities : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is a certain logarithmic average over @xmath7 ( the primordial tensor spectral index ) ; and @xmath5 is a certain logarithmic average over @xmath8 ( the effective equation - of - state parameter in the early universe , after horizon re - entry ) . here </S>",
    "<S> the _ effective _ equation - of - state parameter @xmath8 is a combination of the _ ordinary _ equation - of - state parameter @xmath9 and the bulk viscosity @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by comparing observational constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one obtains ( remarkably tight ) constraints in the @xmath11 plane . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this is the best way to constrain ( or detect ) the presence of a `` stiff '' energy component ( with @xmath12 ) in the early universe , prior to bbn . </S>",
    "<S> ( the discovery of such a component would be no more surprising than the discovery of a tiny cosmological constant at late times ! ) finally , although most of our analysis does _ not _ assume inflation , we point out that if cmb experiments detect a non - zero value for @xmath0 , then we will immediately obtain ( as a free by - product ) a new upper bound @xmath13 on the logarithmically averaged effective equation - of - state parameter during the `` primordial dark age '' between the end of inflation and the start of bbn . </S>"
