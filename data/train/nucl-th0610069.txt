    "landau s theory of normal fermi liquids @xcite describes strongly interacting many - body systems in terms of weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "provided that the quasiparticles lie sufficiently close to the fermi surface , they will be long - lived and constitute appropriate degrees of freedom for the system .",
    "the central aim of the theory is to determine the quasiparticle interaction , either phenomenologically or microscopically , with which it is possible to describe the low - energy , long - wavelength excitations of the system .",
    "this , in turn , is sufficient for the description of many bulk equilibrium properties of the interacting fermi system .",
    "the initial application of fermi liquid theory to nuclear physics was the phenomenological description of finite nuclei and nuclear matter by migdal @xcite , and later a microscopic approach to fermi liquid theory based on the brueckner - bethe - goldstone reaction matrix theory was developed by bckman @xcite and others @xcite to describe nuclear matter .",
    "although the latter approach was quantitatively successful , it was observed @xcite that brueckner - bethe - goldstone theory is less reliable in the vicinity of the fermi surface due to the use of angle - averaged pauli operators and the unsymmetrical treatment of particle and hole self energies , which leads to an unphysical energy gap at the fermi surface .    with the recent development of a nearly universal low - momentum nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction @xmath0 @xcite derived from renormalization group methods , the application of fermi liquid theory to nuclear matter",
    "has received renewed attention @xcite .",
    "the strong short - distance repulsion incorporated into all high - precision nn potential models is integrated out in low momentum interactions , rendering them suitable for perturbation theory calculations .",
    "although limited brueckner - hartree - fock studies @xcite indicate that saturation is not achieved with @xmath0 at a fixed momentum cutoff @xmath2 , it has recently been shown @xcite that by supplementing @xmath0 with the leading - order chiral three - nucleon force , nuclear matter does saturate , thereby justifying the use of @xmath0 in studies of nuclear matter .",
    "although many properties of the interacting ground state are beyond the scope of fermi liquid theory , the quasiparticle interaction is directly related to several nuclear observables , including the compression modulus , symmetry energy , and anomalous orbital gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "as originally shown by landau , the quasiparticle interaction is obtained from a certain limit of the four - point vertex function in the particle - hole channel .",
    "it is well known that using realistic nn interactions in the lowest order approximation to the quasiparticle interaction is insufficient to stabilize nuclear matter , as evidenced by a negative value of the compression modulus .",
    "this general phenomenon is observed in our calculations with @xmath0 as well .",
    "however , stability is achieved by treating the exchange of density , spin , and isospin collective excitations to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the inclusion of these virtual collective modes in the quasiparticle interaction is carried out through the induced interaction formalism of babu and brown @xcite , which was originally developed for the description of liquid @xmath3he and later applied to nuclear matter by sjberg @xcite .",
    "subsequent work @xcite has confirmed the importance of the induced interaction in building up correlations around a single quasiparticle , thereby increasing the compression modulus .",
    "our study is motivated in part by the work of schwenk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who were able to predict the spin - dependent parameters of the quasiparticle interaction from the experimentally extracted spin - independent parameters .",
    "crucial to these calculations was a novel set of sum rules , derived from the induced interaction formalism , based on a similar treatment by bedell and ainsworth @xcite to liquid @xmath3he . in this paper",
    "we present a fully self - consistent solution to the babu - brown induced interaction equations for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "our iterative solution turns out to be qualitatively similar to the results of @xcite , but we find that at nuclear matter density the compression modulus and symmetry energy are smaller than the experimentally observed values while the anomalous orbital gyromagnetic ratio is too large , suggesting the possibility that important phenomena have been neglected .",
    "we propose to extend this study by including hadronic modifications associated with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry at nuclear matter density , as suggested in @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "referred to as brown - rho scaling , the dynamically generated hadronic masses drop in the approach to chiral restoration , and at nuclear matter density it is expected that the masses of the light hadrons ( other than the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons , which are protected by their goldstone nature ) decrease by approximately 20% .",
    "the success of one - boson - exchange and chiral eft potentials in describing the nucleon - nucleon interaction suggests that a modification of meson masses in medium ought to have verifiable consequences in low energy nuclear physics .",
    "although there is much current theoretical and experimental effort devoted to the program of assessing these medium modifications , the consequences for low - energy nuclear physics have yet to be fully explored .",
    "applying the mass scaling suggested in @xcite to our calculations of nuclear matter , we obtain a set of fermi liquid coefficients in better agreement with both experiment and the nontrivial sum rules derived in @xcite .",
    "explicit three - body forces , though essential for a complete description of nuclear matter , have been neglected in this study .",
    "however , we argue that modifying the vector meson masses is equivalent to including a specific short - ranged three - body force .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the consequences of brown - rho scaling on the tensor force , which is diminished by the increasing strength of @xmath4-meson exchange .",
    "in this section we present a short description of fermi liquid theory and its application to nuclear physics with emphasis on the microscopic foundation of the theory .",
    "the main assumption underlying landau s description of many - body fermi systems is that there is a one - to - one correspondence between states of the ideal system and states of the interacting system .",
    "as one gradually turns on the interaction , the noninteracting particles become `` dressed '' through interactions with the many - body medium and evolve into weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "the interacting system is in many ways similar to an ideal system in that the classification of energy states remains unchanged and there is a well - defined fermi surface , but the quasiparticles acquire an effective mass @xmath5 and finite lifetimes .",
    "the energy of the interacting system is a complicated functional of the quasiparticle distribution function , and in general the exact dependence is inaccessible .",
    "but one can extract important information about bulk properties of the system by considering small changes in the distribution function .",
    "expanding to second order , one finds @xmath6 in this equation @xmath7 is the volume of the system , @xmath8 is the energy added to the system by introducing a single quasiparticle with momentum @xmath9 ( note that for @xmath10 , @xmath11 is just the chemical potential ) , and @xmath12 describes the interaction between two quasiparticles .",
    "since the quasiparticle interaction @xmath12 is the fundamental quantity of interest in fermi liquid theory , we will carefully discuss its properties and its relationship to nuclear observables .",
    "assuming the interaction to be purely exchange , it can be written as @xmath13 , \\label{ffunction}\\ ] ] where we have factored out the density of states per unit volume at the fermi surface , @xmath14 , which leaves dimensionless fermi liquid parameters denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is neglected because it vanishes in the long wavelength limit in which we will be interested .",
    "also , we have not included tensor operators ( which would greatly complicate our calculation ) because the tensor force contributes almost completely in second order , as shown in the original paper by kuo and brown @xcite , as an effective central interaction in the @xmath16 state . in @xcite",
    "the tensor fermi liquid parameters for symmetric nuclear matter were calculated from @xmath0 in which the dominant second - order contributions from one - pion exchange were included . since quasiparticles are well - defined only near the fermi surface , we assume that @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the dimensionless fermi liquid parameters @xmath18 depend on only the angle between @xmath9 and @xmath19 , which we call @xmath20 .",
    "then it is convenient to perform a legendre polynomial expansion as follows @xmath21 the fermi liquid parameters @xmath22 decrease rapidly for larger @xmath23 , and so there are only a small number of parameters that can either be fit to experiment or calculated microscopically .    in the original application of the theory to liquid @xmath3he and nuclear systems ,",
    "the quasiparticle interaction was obtained phenomenologically by fitting the dimensionless fermi liquid parameters to relevant data . for nuclear matter",
    "several important relationships exist between nuclear observables and the fermi liquid parameters .",
    "galilean invariance can be used @xcite to connect the landau parameter @xmath24 to the quasiparticle effective mass @xmath25 adding a small number of neutrons and removing the same number of protons from the system will increase and decrease , respectively , the density of protons and neutrons in the system ( and therefore the fermi energies of the two species ) .",
    "the change in the energy , described by the symmetry energy @xmath26 , can be related @xcite to the landau parameter @xmath27 @xmath28 in a similar way , the equal increase or decrease of the proton and neutron densities leads to a relationship between the scalar - isoscalar landau parameter @xmath29 and the compression modulus @xmath30 @xmath31 finally , it can be shown @xcite that an odd nucleon added just above the fermi sea induces a polarization of the medium leading to an anomalous contribution to the orbital gyromagnetic ratio of the form @xmath32",

    "for instance , if @xmath35 or @xmath36 , the effective mass or compression modulus would be negative .",
    "quite generally it can be shown @xcite that the landau parameters must satisfy stability conditions @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents @xmath39 .",
    "a rigorous foundation for the assumptions underlying landau s theory can be obtained through formal many - body techniques @xcite .",
    "it is not our goal to reproduce the original arguments @xcite , but rather to give a clear motivation for the diagrammatic expansion leading to the quasiparticle interaction .",

    "we can write @xmath47 and therefore define @xmath48 .",
    "the important point is that since we are considering only low - energy long - wavelength excitations , the particle - hole energy - momentum @xmath49 should be small .",
    "we can write a bethe - salpeter equation for the fully reducible vertex function @xmath50 in terms of the _ ph _ irreducible vertex function @xmath51 in the direct channel with momentum transfer @xmath49 : @xmath52 shown diagrammatically in fig .",

    "the limit @xmath59 depends on the relative ordering of the two limits @xmath60 and @xmath61 . defining @xmath62 from eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) we see that the product of propagators is regular for @xmath63 .",
    "thus , to calculate @xmath63 we must first calculate the @xmath53 irreducible diagrams belonging to @xmath51 and then iterate via the bethe - salpeter equation with the intermediate multipair background @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath55-function singularities in @xmath65 can be used to perform the integrals over @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and through algebraic manipulation it is possible to combine @xmath63 and @xmath65 into a single integral equation @xmath68 physically , @xmath63 represents the exchange of virtual excitations between quasiparticles , and @xmath65 represents the forward scattering of quasiparticles at the fermi surface . by relating these vertex functions to the equations describing zero sound , landau @xcite was able to make the identifications @xmath69 where @xmath70 is just the quasiparticle interaction introduced earlier and @xmath71 is the physical scattering amplitude .",
    "in principle one could exactly calculate the quasiparticle interaction by summing up all @xmath53 irreducible diagrams contributing to the @xmath53 vertex function in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "since this is not practicable in general , one must limit the calculation to a certain subset of diagrams .",
    "we could proceed by calculating the relevant diagrams order by order , but this would miss an essential point , which we now elaborate . from eqs .",

    "this leads to two constraints @xcite on the fermi liquid parameters in the form of sum rules : @xmath75    @xmath76    clearly , the sum rules must be satisfied for the `` correct '' set of fermi liquid parameters describing nuclear matter . to account for this infinite set of exchange diagrams ,",
    "babu and brown @xcite proposed separating the quasiparticle interaction into a _ driving term _ and an _ induced term _ : @xmath77 where the induced interaction is defined to contain those diagrams that would be the exchange terms necessary to preserve the antisymmetry of @xmath71 .",
    "then the induced interaction is given by a diagrammatic expansion shown in fig .",

    "these equations were first obtained in @xcite , carried far enough to include velocity - dependent effects in terms of an effective mass , in the approximation of quadratic spectrum .",
    "having characterized the induced part of the quasiparticle interaction , let us now elaborate on the driving term . by definition ,",
    "this component of the interaction consists of those diagrams that can not be separated into two diagrams by cutting one particle line and one hole line .",
    "some of the low order terms contributing to the driving term are shown in fig .",
    "[ driving ] , where the interaction vertices are assumed to be antisymmetrized .",
    "some higher - order terms , such as diagram @xmath89 in fig .",

    "[ driving](d ) requires that ( e ) also be included in order for the scattering amplitude to be antisymmetric .",
    "according to the discussion in the previous section , the starting point of a microscopic derivation of the quasiparticle interaction is a calculation of the antisymmetrized driving term to some specified order in the bare potential .",
    "nearly all previous calculations have used the @xmath90-matrix , since it is well known that the unrenormalized high - precision nn potentials are unsuitable for perturbation theory calculations due to the presence of a strong short - distance repulsion .",
    "the resummation of particle - particle ladder diagrams in the @xmath90-matrix softens the potential but introduces several undesirable features from the perspective of fermi liquid theory .",
    "most important is the unphysical gap in the single particle energy spectrum at the fermi surface due to the fact that hole lines receive self - energy corrections but particle lines do not . in the past",
    "it was suggested @xcite that introducing a model space , within which particles and holes are treated symmetrically , could overcome this difficulty .",
    "an alternative method for taming the repulsive core is to integrate out the high momentum components of the interaction in such a way that the low energy dynamics are preserved @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by rewriting the half - on - shell @xmath91-matrix @xmath92 with an explicit momentum cutoff @xmath2 , which yields the low momentum @xmath91-matrix defined by @xmath93 enforcing the requirement that @xmath94 for @xmath95 preserves the low energy physics encoded in the scattering phase shifts . remarkably , under this construction all high - precision nn potentials flow to a nearly universal low momentum interaction @xmath0 as the momentum cutoff @xmath2 is lowered to @xmath96 @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , @xmath98 @xmath97 is precisely the cm momentum beyond which the experimental phase shift analysis has not been incorporated in the high - precision nn interactions .    for an initial approximation to the driving term",
    ", we include the first - order antisymmetrized matrix element shown diagrammatically in fig.[driving](a ) as well as the higher order diagrams , such as ( d ) and ( e ) , that are included implicitly through the renormalization strength at the quasiparticle pole .",
    "the quasiparticles are confined to a thin model space @xmath99 near the fermi surface @xmath100 and the first - order contribution is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath20 is the angle between the two momenta , and the relative momentum @xmath103 . given the @xmath0 matrix elements in the basis @xmath104 , we project onto the central components and change from a spherical wave basis to a plane wave basis .",

    "the tensor force contributes chiefly in second order perturbation theory as an effective central force in the @xmath116 channel . as the density increases ,",
    "some of the intermediate states are blocked by the pauli principle . in the two - body system",
    "the tensor force contributes to the @xmath16 state , but not to the @xmath117 state , and gives most of the attractive interaction difference between the @xmath16 and @xmath117 states , effectively binding the deuteron .",

    "however , since the beginning of brown - rho scaling it has been understood that the tensor force is rapidly cut down with increasing density .",
    "that is because the pion mass does not change with density , being protected by chiral invariance , but the @xmath115-meson mass , which is dynamically generated , decreases by 20% ( parametric scaling ) in going from a density of @xmath120 to nuclear matter density @xmath121 .",
    "since the @xmath115-meson exchange contributes with opposite sign from that of the pion , this cuts down the tensor force substantially . in fig .",

    "brown and rho showed that in cases where the exchange of the @xmath122-meson is not important , such as in dirac phenomenology , there is a scale invariance such that if the masses of all relevant mesons are changed by the same amount , the results for the physical phenomena are very little changed .    since the pion exchange gives the longest range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , it is amazing that there are not clearcut examples in nuclear spectroscopy such as level orderings that are altered by the @xmath115-meson exchange playing counterpoint to the @xmath122-meson exchange , as we find in this paper for nuclear saturation .",
    "the in - medium decrease in the @xmath115-mass increases the effect of @xmath115-exchange , which enters so as to cut down the overall tensor force , the @xmath115 and @xmath122 exchange entering with opposite sign .",

    "<S> we present a description of symmetric nuclear matter within the framework of landau fermi liquid theory . </S>",
    "<S> the low momentum nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath0 is used to calculate the effective interaction between quasiparticles on the fermi surface , from which we extract the quasiparticle effective mass , the nuclear compression modulus , the symmetry energy , and the anomalous orbital gyromagnetic ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange of density , spin , and isospin collective excitations is included through the babu - brown induced interaction , and it is found that in the absence of three - body forces the self - consistent solution to the babu - brown equations is in poor agreement with the empirical values for the nuclear observables . </S>",
    "<S> this is improved by lowering the nucleon and meson masses according to brown - rho scaling , essentially by including a scalar tadpole contribution to the meson and nucleon masses , as well as by scaling @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that modifying the masses of the exchanged mesons is equivalent to introducing a short - range three - body force , and the net result is that the brown - rho double decimation @xcite is accomplished all at once . </S>"
