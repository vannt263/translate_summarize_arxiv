    "solar prominences or filaments are cool and dense plasmas embedded in the million - kelvin corona @xcite . the plasmas originate from the direct injection of chromospheric materials into a preexisting filament channel , levitation of chromospheric mass into the corona , or condensation of hot plasmas from the chromospheric evaporation due to the thermal instability @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , if the confinement from the background field is strong enough , the filament will decelerate to reach the maximum height before falling back to the solar surface , which means the eruption is failed @xcite .",

    "initial brigtenings ( ib1 , ib2 , and ib3 ) appeared near the ends and center of the sigmoidal filament , implying that magnetic reconnection took place and the filament got unstable ( figure  [ fig3](b)-(d ) ) .",
    "such initial brightenings were evident in all the euv wavelengths .",
    "with the intensities of the brigtenings increasing , the dark filament rose and expanded slowly , squeezing the overlying arcade field lines .",
    "null - point magnetic reconnection might be triggered when the filament reached the initial height of the null point ( @xmath215 mm ) , leading to impulsive brightenings in h@xmath3 ( figure  [ fig1](c)-(d ) ) and euv ( figure  [ fig3](e)-(h ) ) wavelengths and increases in sxr and hxr fluxes ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",

    "there was only one hxr source associated with the flare , and the source was located along the flare ribbon with the strongest h@xmath3 emission , which is compatible with the fact that the footpoint hxr emissions come from the nonthermal bremsstrahlung of the accelerated high - energy electrons after penetrating into the chromosphere .",
    "the flare demonstrates itself not only around the filament but also at the point - like brightening ( pb hereafter ) and the v - shape ribbon to the left of the quasi - circular ribbon . since the separatrix surface intersects with the photosphere at pb to the north and the outer spine intersects with the photosphere to the east ( figure  [ fig2](a ) ) , it is believed that nonthermal electrons accelerated by the null - point magnetic reconnection penetrated into the lower atmosphere not only at the quasi - circular ribbon , but also at pb and the v - shape ribbon .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the sxr ( black solid and dashed lines ) and hxr ( colored solid lines ) light curves of the flare .",

    "the hxr fluxes below 25 kev varied smoothly like the sxr fluxes , except for earlier peak times at @xmath215:43:10 ut .",
    "the hxr fluxes above 25 kev , however , experienced two small peaks that imply precursor release of magnetic energy and particle acceleration at @xmath215:38:36 ut and @xmath215:41:24 ut and a major peak at @xmath215:43:10 ut . the time delay between the sxr and hxr peak times implies the possible neupert effect for this event @xcite .",
    "the main phase of the flare sustained until @xmath217:00 ut , indicating that the flare is a long - duration event .    during the flare , the filament continued to rise and split into two branches at the eastern leg around 15:46 ut ( figure  [ fig1](e ) ) , the right of which is thicker and darker than the left one .",
    "such a process is most clearly revealed by the aia 335  observation ( see the online movie animation3.mpg ) .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] displays eight snapshots of the 335  images .",
    "it is seen that the dark filament broadened from @xmath215:42:30 ut and completely split into two branches around 15:45:51 ut .",
    "we define the left and right branches as the runaway part and major part of the filament .",
    "the two interwinding parts also underwent rotation ( panels ( d)-(h ) ) .",
    "meanwhile , the plasma of the runaway part moved in the northwest direction and escaped . to illustrate the rotation , we derived the time - slice diagrams of the two slices ( s4 and s5 in panel ( f ) ) that are plotted in figure  [ fig6 ] .",

    "@xmath12 in the diagrams stands for the southwest endpoints of the slices .",
    "the filament began to split into two parts around 15:42:30 ut , with the runaway part rotating round the eastern leg of the major part for @xmath21 turn until @xmath215:55 ut .    during the eruption , the runaway branch of the filament disappeared ( figure  [ fig1](f ) ) .",
    "the major part , however , fell back to the solar surface after reaching the maximum height around 15:51 ut , suggesting that the eruption of the major part of the filament was failed .",
    "the remaining filament after the flare was evident in the h@xmath3 image ( figure  [ fig1](h ) ) .",

    "the time - slice diagram of s0 in uv and euv passbands are presented in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "we selected two relatively hot filters ( 335  and 211  in the top panels ) , two warm filters ( 171  and 304  in the middle panels ) , and two cool filters ( 1600  and 1700  in the bottom panels ) , respectively .",
    "similar to the time - slice diagram in h@xmath3 ( figure  [ fig8](a ) ) , the filament rose at apparent speeds of 92@xmath0151 km s@xmath1 before felling back in an oscillatory way at the speeds of 34@xmath046 km s@xmath1 during 15:51@xmath016:10 ut and @xmath271 km s@xmath1 during 16:18@xmath016:30 ut ( figure  [ fig9](a)-(d ) ) .",

    "the regions within the green and blue elliptical lines are dominated by eastward and westward motions at the speeds of @xmath21.5 km s@xmath1 . from the online movie ( animation6.mpg )",
    ", we can see that the continuous shearing motions were evident before the flare , implying that the magnetic free energy and helicity were accumulated and stored before the impulsive release .",
    "once the free energy of the ar is accumulated to a critical value , chances are that the filament constrained by the overlying magnetic field lines undergoes an eruption .",
    "several types of triggering mechanism have been proposed .",
    "one type of processes where magnetic reconnection is involved include the flux emergence model @xcite , catastrophic model @xcite , tether - cutting model @xcite , and breakout model @xcite , to name a few .",
    "another type is the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes as a result of ki @xcite and/or ti @xcite . from figure  [ fig15 ] and the movie ( animation5.mpg )",
    ", we can see that before the flare there was continuous magnetic flux emergence ( p2 , p3 , and p4 ) and subsequent magnetic cancellation along the fragmented pil .",
    "we extracted a large region within the white dashed box of figure  [ fig15](d ) and calculated the total positive ( @xmath31 ) and negative ( @xmath32 ) magnetic fluxes within the box . in figure",
    "[ fig17 ] , the temporal evolutions of the fluxes during 11:00@xmath016:30 ut are plotted , with the evolution of @xmath31 divided into five phases ( i@xmath0v ) separated by the dotted lines . the first four phases before the onset of flare at 15:32 ut are characterized by quasi - periodic and small - amplitude magnetic flux emergence and cancellation , implying that the large - scale magnetic field was undergoing rearrangement before the flare .",
    "the intensity contours of the 304  images in figure  [ fig3](b ) and ( d ) are overlaid on the magnetograms in figure  [ fig15](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the initial brightenings ib1 and ib2 are very close to the small positive polarities p4 and p3 .",
    "there is no significant magnetic flux emergence around ib3 . in the emerging - flux - induced - eruption model @xcite ,",
    "when reconnection - favorable magnetic bipole emerges from beneath the photosphere into the filament channel , it reconnects with the preexisting magnetic field lines that compress the inverse - polarity mfr .",
    "the small - scale magnetic reconnection and flux cancellation serve as the precursor for the upcoming filament eruption and flare . during the flare",
    "when magnetic reconnection occurred between 15:32 ut and 16:10 ut , both the positive and negative magnetic field experienced impulsive and irreversible changes .    despite that the flux emergences are plausible to interpret the triggering mechanism",
    ", there is another possibility . in the tether - cutting model @xcite , a pair of @xmath33-shape sheared arcades that comprise a sigmoid reconnect when the two elbows come into contact , forming a short loop and a long mfr .",
    "whether the mfr experiences a failed or ejective eruption depends on the strength of compression from the large - scale background field .",
    "the initial brightenings ( ib1 , ib2 , and ib3 ) around the sigmoidal filament might be the precursor brightenings as a result of internal tether - cutting reconnection due to the continuous shearing motion along the pil .",
    "after onset , the whole flux system erupted and produced the m - class flare . considering that the magnetic configuration could not be modelled during the flare , we are not sure whether a coherent mfr was formed after the initiation @xcite . compared to the flux emergences",
    ", the internal tether - cutting seems more believable to interpret how the filament eruption was triggered for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the filament was supported by sheared arcade .",
    "secondly , there were continuous shearing motions along the pil , and the directions were favorable for the tether - cutting reconnection . finally , the initial brightenings ( ib1 , ib2 , and ib3 ) around the filament in figure  [ fig3 ] fairly match the internal tether - cutting reconnection with the presence of multiple bright patches of flare emission in the chromosphere at the feet of reconnected field lines , while there was no flux emergence around ib3 .",
    "nlfff modelling shows that the twist number ( @xmath21 ) of the sheared arcades supporting the filament is less than the threshold value ( @xmath21.5 ) , implying that the filament eruption may not be triggered by ideal ki .",
    "the photospheric magnetic field of the ar features a bipole ( p1 and n1 ) and a couple of mini - polarities ( e.g. , p2 , p3 , p4 , and n2 ) .",
    "therefore , the filament eruption could not be explained by the breakout model that requires quadrupolar magnetic field , although null - point magnetic reconnection took place above the filament during the eruption .    after the onset of eruption , the filament split into two parts as described in section  [ s - result ] .",
    "how the filament split is still unclear . in the previous literatures , magnetic reconnection",
    "is involved in the split in most cases @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the split occurred during the impulsive phase of the flare at the eastern leg that was closer to the flare site than the western one , implying that the split was associated with the release of magnetic energy .",
    "the subsequent rotation or unwinding motion implies the release of magnetic helicity stored in the filament before the flare , presumably due to the shearing motion in the photosphere . nevertheless , it is still elusive whether the filament existed as a whole or was composed of two interwinding parts before splitting .",
    "the way of splitting seems difficult to be explained by any of the previous models and requires in - depth investigations .",
    "though the runaway part escaped out of the corona , the major part failed .",
    "it returned to the solar surface after reaching the apex .",
    "such kind of failed eruptions have been frequently observed and explained by the strapping effect of the overlying arcade @xcite or asymmetry of the background magnetic fields with respect to the location of the filament @xcite . in order to figure out the cause of failed eruption of the major part",
    ", we turn to the large - scale magnetic configurations displayed in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is revealed that the overlying magnetic arcades above ar 11283 are asymmetric to a great extent , i.e. , the magnetic field to the west of ar is much stronger than that to the east , which is similar to the case of @xcite . according to the analysis of @xcite , the confinements of the large - scale arcade acted on the filament are strong enough to prevent it from escaping .",
    "we also performed magnetic potential - field extrapolation using the same boundary and derived the distributions of @xmath34 above the pil .",
    "it is found that the maximum height of the major part considerably exceeds the critical height ( @xmath280@xmath11 ) of ti where the decay index ( @xmath35 ) of the background potential field reaches @xmath21.5 .",
    "the major part would have escaped from the corona successfully after entering the instability domain if ti had worked .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry with respect to the filament location , rather than ti of the overlying arcades , seems reasonable and convincing to interpret why the major part of the filament underwent failed eruption . in this study , both successful and failed eruptions occurred in a partially eruptive event , which provides more constraints to the theoretical models of solar eruptions .      since the first discovery of coronal loop oscillations during flares @xcite",
    ", such kind of oscillations are found to be ubiquitous and be useful for the diagnostics of coronal magnetic field @xcite . owing to the complex interconnections of the magnetic field lines , blast wave and/or euv wave induced by filament eruption",
    "may disturb the adjacent coronal loops in the same ar or remote loops in another ar , resulting in transverse kink - mode oscillations .",
    "@xcite observed decaying and decayless transverse oscillations of a coronal loop on 2012 may 30 .",
    "the loops experience small - amplitude decayless oscillations , which is driven by an external non - resonant harmonic driver before and after the flare @xcite .",
    "the flare , as an impulsive driver , triggers large - amplitude decaying loop oscillations . in our study , the decayless loop oscillation with moderate amplitude ( @xmath21.6 mm ) occurred during the flare and lasted for only two cycles , which makes it quite difficult to precisely measure the decay timescale if it is decaying indeed .",
    "the loop may cool down and become invisible in 171  while oscillating .",
    "considering that the distance between the flare and ol is @xmath250 mm and the time delay between the flare onset and loop oscillation is @xmath26 minutes , the speed of propagation of the disturbances from the flare to ol is estimated to be @xmath2140 km s@xmath1 , which is close to the local sound speed of the plasmas with temperature of @xmath20.8 mk .",
    "hence , we suppose that the coronal loop oscillation was triggered by the external disturbances as a result of the rising and expanding motions of the filament .      flares and cmes play a very important role in the generation of space weather . accurate prediction of space weather is of great significance .",
    "successful eruptions have substantially been observed and deeply investigated .",
    "partial filament eruptions that produce flares and cmes , however , are rarely detected and poorly explored . for the type of partial eruptions in this study ,",
    "i.e. , one part undergoes failed eruption and the other part escapes out of the corona , it would be misleading and confusing to assess and predict the space weather effects based on the information only from the solar surface , since the escaping part may carry or produce solar energetic particles that have potential geoeffectiveness .",
    "complete observations are necessary for accurate predictions .",
    "using the multiwavelength observations from both spaceborne and ground - based telescopes , we studied in detail a partial filament eruption event in ar 11283 on 2011 september 8 .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a magnetic null point was found above the preexisting positive polarity surrounded by negative polarities in the ar .",
    "a spine passed through the null and intersected with the photosphere to the left . weakly twisted sheared arcade supporting the filament was located under the null point whose height increased slightly by @xmath20.4 mm after the eruption .",
    "2 .   the filament rose and expanded , which was probably triggered by the internal tether - cutting reconnection or by continuous magnetic flux emergence and cancellation along the highly complex and fragmented pil , the former of which seems more convincing . during its eruption , it triggered the null - point magnetic reconnection and the m6.7 flare with a single hxr source at different energy bands .",
    "the flare produced a quasi - circular ribbon and a v - shape ribbon where the outer spine intersects with the photosphere .",
    "during the expansion , the filament split into two parts at the eastern leg that is closer to the flare site .",
    "the major part of the filament rose at the speeds of 90@xmath0150 km s@xmath1 before reaching the maximum apparent height of @xmath2115 mm .",
    "afterwards , it returned to the solar surface staggeringly at the speeds of 20@xmath080 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the rising and falling motions of the filament were clearly observed in the uv , euv , and h@xmath3 wavelengths .",
    "the failed eruption of the major part was most probably caused by the asymmetry of the overlying magnetic arcades with respect to the filament location .",
    "4 .   the runaway part , however , separated from and rotated around the major part for @xmath21 turn before escaping outward from the corona at the speeds of 125@xmath0255 km s@xmath1 , probably along the large - scale open magnetic field lines as evidenced by the pfss modelling and the type slowromancap3@ radio burst .",
    "the ejected part of the filament led to a faint cme . the angular width and apparent speed of the cme in the fov of c2",
    "are 37@xmath8 and 214 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the propagation directions of the escaping filament observed by sdo / aia and _ sta_/euvi are consistent with those of the cme observed by lasco / c2 and _ sta_/cor1 , respectively .",
    "the partial filament eruption also triggered transverse oscillation of the neighbouring coronal loops in the same ar .",
    "the amplitude and period of the kink - mode oscillation were 1.6 mm and 225 s. we also performed diagnostics of the plasma density and temperature of the oscillating loops .",
