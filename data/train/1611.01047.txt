    "5-bromouracil ( 5bu ) can replace thymine ( t ) in dna,@xcite causing strong mutagenic effects that have been explained by base mispairings due to 5bu s tautomeric equilibrium.@xcite the substitution of t by 5bu is also accompanied by an increased uv light sensitivity of the affected dna,@xcite where the presence of the 5bu can cause single strand breaks , alkali - labile bonds , double strand breaks , and dna - protein crosslinking.@xcite the occurrence of these lesions originates from the ability of 5bu to cleave the c - br bond , leading to the formation of an uracilyl radical.@xcite this radical in turn can abstract a hydrogen atom from a suitable donor ( e.g. , an adjacent sugar ) , thereby forming uracil ( u ) ; see figure  [ fig : scheme1 ] for the chemical structures of 5bu , t , and u. hence , the uracilyl radical is responsible for dna damage and can be exploited for a variety of processes , such as dna crosslinking,@xcite adenine elimination,@xcite or generation of reactive oxygen species for photodynamical therapy .",
    "two different mechanisms have been proposed for the dissociation of the c - br bond of 5bu.@xcite the first route is initiated by an excited - state electron transfer from an adjacent nucleobase to 5bu , resulting in the formation of the 5bu@xmath3 radical anion , which then undergoes c - br cleavage , liberating a bromide ion and leaving behind the highly reactive uracilyl radical.@xcite in the second one , 5bu can also homolytically cleave the c - br bond without any electron transfer involved.@xcite these two routes differ in their selectivity for certain types of damages.@xcite moreover , it has been shown that the damage induced by 5bu depends on the dna conformation,@xcite which could be utilized in tumor radiosensitization applications.@xcite    given the potential applicability of 5bu , which has been even used in a clinical trial,@xcite a number of papers focused on the primary photochemical properties of 5bu .",
    "however , the molecular details of the deactivation of 5bu are still poorly understood .",
    "based on experimental evidence , it has been suggested that c - br homolysis occurs in the excited singlet state ( starting from @xmath4).@xcite intersystem crossing ( isc ) to the triplet manifold has been also reported,@xcite but in these experiments performed in 2-propanol , dissociation takes place involving electron transfer from the solvent . in this case , the associated quantum yields were reported to be 1.3% for homolysis from @xmath4 , 3% for isc , and 0.6% for isc followed by dissociation.@xcite excitation at lower energy apparently increases the isc yield to 6%.@xcite    5bu has also been studied with femtosecond time - resolved pump - probe experiments in water,@xcite where it has been found that after excitation , most of the signal decays with a 400  fs time constant , and the long - lived residual decays with a nanosecond time constant . since the work reported in these studies@xcite was focused on the dynamics of solvated electrons and the formation of 5bu@xmath3 , no further interpretation was given regarding the time scales intrinsic to 5bu .",
    "mechanistically , static quantum chemical calculations on isolated 5bu have provided support for two pathways operating after 5bu is irradiated by uv light  one pathway is responsible for bromine elimination and the second leads back to the reactant through a conical intersection.@xcite according to that study , there are two internal coordinates that are critical for the description of the deactivation processes of 5bu , the c@xmath5-br bond length and the out - of - plane angle of the bromine atom .",
    "the authors then proposed that reactivity is controlled by an extended @xmath6 near - degeneracy seam along a combination of these two internal coordinates .",
    "this seam can be accessed after small barriers are overcome .",
    "depending on the particular point on the seam at where the system decays to the ground state , either dissociation or reactant recovery takes place .    in this paper , we study the gas - phase deactivation pathways of 5bu after uv irradiation using potential energy surface explorations and additionally using the sharc ( surface hopping with arbitrary couplings ) dynamics method,@xcite in order to get additional insights , paying special attention to the role of triplet states .",
    "previous sharc simulations have shown that triplet states can be populated in ultrafast short time scales in a number of nucleobases@xcite and nucleobases analogues , such as those resulting from the substitution of the oxygen atom by the heavier sulfur atom.@xcite here , the presence of the heavy bromine atom might provide strong spin - orbit couplings making the intersystem crossing ( isc ) to the triplet states a viable process , as proposed experimentally.@xcite",
    "two different strategies were employed here to study the deactivation pathways of 5bu , static quantum chemical calculations ( single - point calculations , optimizations and linear interpolation scans ) and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations .",
    "the methods employed in each case are detailed in the following .",
    "vertical excitation calculations were performed , using the ground state geometry reported in ref .  ,",
    "which was optimized at the casscf(12,10)/6 - 311 g * level of theory .",
    "first , the vertical excitation calculations were performed with molcas 8.0@xcite at the ms - caspt2(20,14 ) level of theory .",
    "we employed the ano - rcc - vdzp@xcite basis set , an ipea shift@xcite of zero@xcite and an imaginary level shift@xcite of 0.2  a.u . to exclude intruder states . the employed active space orbitals ( 9 @xmath7 orbitals , 3 lone pair orbitals , and the @xmath8 pair of the c - br bond )",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : orbs]a .",
    "either 9 singlet states or 8 triplet states were included in the calculations , where this relatively large number of states was necessary to stabilize the active space .        in order to find a cheaper but still accurate alternative to ms - caspt2(20,14 ) , vertical excitation calculations were then performed with additional methods , using the same geometry . here , we employed sa - casscf(14,11)/cc - pvdz - dk@xcite ( using molcas 8.0@xcite ) , adc(2)/def2-tzvp ( using turbomole 7.0@xcite ) , td - bp86/tzp , td - b3lyp / tzp ( both using adf@xcite ) , and mrcis / cc - pvdz - dk@xcite ( using columbus 7@xcite ) .",
    "the three main relaxation pathways possible in 5bu  ground state relaxation , isc , and photodissociation  were investigated by means of optimizations of excited - state minima and crossing points . to this aim , we employed the external optimizer of orca,@xcite which was fed the appropriate gradients according to refs .  .",
    "due to the high cost of ms - caspt2(20,14 ) calculations , these optimizations employed gradients from adc(2 ) or numerical gradients from ms - caspt2(12,9 ) . based on the optimized geometries ,",
    "several linear - interpolation - in - internal - coordinates ( liic ) scans were performed at the ms - caspt2(20,14 ) and adc(2 ) levels of theory .",
    "dynamics simulations were carried out with a local development version of the sharc code.@xcite sharc is a generalization of the trajectory surface hopping method@xcite that allows the simultaneous description of singlet and triplet states , coupled by nonadiabatic and spin - orbit couplings.@xcite    the initial conditions were sampled from a wigner - ville distribution@xcite of the ground state oscillator , based on mp2/ano - rcc - vdzp harmonic frequencies . for a set of 1000 initial geometries",
    ", vertical excitation calculations provided the initial electronic state distribution.@xcite this procedure yielded 93  admissible initial conditions in the @xmath9  ev window around the absorption maximum of 5bu ( at our level of theory ) .",
    "out of these , 82 trajectories were started in the @xmath10 and 11 in the @xmath11 state .",
    "the trajectories were propagated for 400  fs , using a time step of 0.5  fs for the nuclear motion and 0.02  fs for the electronic wave function propagation .",
    "the local diabatization procedure@xcite with wave function overlaps@xcite was employed .",
    "decoherence was treated with an energy gap - based scheme.@xcite from the total 93 trajectories , 15  trajectories were discarded due to convergence problems .    for each nuclear time step ,",
    "the involved energies , gradients , wave function overlaps,@xcite and spin - orbit couplings@xcite were calculated at the multi - reference configuration interaction including single excitations ( mrcis ) level of theory with the cc - pvdz - dk basis set.@xcite the columbus 7.0@xcite program suite , employing integrals from molcas,@xcite was used .",
    "the orbitals were optimized using sa - casscf(10,8 ) ( orbitals in figure  [ fig : orbs]b ) , averaging simultaneously over 4  singlets and 3  triplet states . in order to keep the computations feasible , the mrcis reference space employed a restricted active space scheme , where in the reference configuration state functions only up to two electrons were allowed in the three antibonding orbitals .",
    "this approach allowed retaining as many orbitals in the reference space as possible , to allow maximum flexibility in order to describe the three main deactivation pathways of this molecule .",
    "this is particularly important here , since valence excitations and excitations responsible for the dissociation of the c - br bond need to be considered on the same footing .",

    "the @xmath25 is another @xmath0 state , located at 6.01  ev .",
    "the order of the singlet states agrees with that obtained with previous calculations on 5bu.@xcite the character of the triplet states mirror the singlet counterparts up to @xmath26 , with the lowest triplet state being the @xmath2 state , followed by the @xmath27 state ( @xmath28 ) .    due to their good agreement with the experimental values ,",
    "the ms - caspt2 values serve as reference data for the other levels of theory . as an estimator for the accuracy of the excited - state calculations , we computed root mean square deviations ( rmsd , bottom of table  [ tab : vertexc ] ) , comparing states of matching characters against the ms - caspt2 results . for the rmsd calculation we only included the relevant , low - lying states with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or @xmath31 characters  which are the @xmath32 or @xmath33 for ms - caspt2 but might be different adiabatic states for the other methods . among the five cheaper levels of theory ,",
    "the worst result is obtained with casscf ( 1.01  ev rmsd ) and the best result with adc(2 ) ( 0.21  ev ) .",
    "the casscf and mrcis methods both significantly overestimate the energies of the @xmath4 states , changing the order of singlet excited states ; this observation is due to an imbalanced description of correlation energy in these methods .",
    "td - bp86 systematically underestimates all excitation energies by about 1  ev on average , and alters the order of the states as well . on the other hand ,",
    "td - b3lyp describes the excitation energies fairly well , in particular the bright @xmath4 state , and gives the correct order for the three lowest singlet states . in general , only the few lowest excited states in each multiplicity are consistently obtained with all methods , although the ordering can vary ; for the higher states , different characters were obtained , and the energy deviations are larger than for the lower states .",
    "the calculated vertical excitations are only the first step in disentangling the actual photophysical relaxation pathways of 5bu .",
    "hence , as a second step we investigated the most important pathways  ground state relaxation , isc , and photodissociation  in more detail .",
    "because of the high cost of ms - caspt2(20,14 ) , the necessary optimizations were carried out with ms - caspt2(12,9 ) , which excludes the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 orbitals .",
    "this reduced active space is only suitable to describe the lowest excitations ( the @xmath0 and @xmath21 states ) , but allows optimizing the critical points for these states .",
    "as adc(2 ) gave very promising results in the franck - condon region , we also performed these computations with adc(2 ) , to see whether its accuracy extends to the rest of the pess .",
    "the following minima were obtained at both levels of theory : the @xmath13 minimum , a minimum of the @xmath1 state ( located on the @xmath19 adiabatic surface ) , and a @xmath2 minimum ( @xmath20 ) , shown in figure  [ fig : geoms ] a - c . additionally , crossing points between several electronic states ( adiabatic surfaces in parenthesis ) were found : a @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) conical intersection ( coin ) , a @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) coin , a @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) minimum - energy crossing ( mxp ) , and a @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) coin , which are presented in figure  [ fig : geoms ] d - g .",
    "the attempted optimization of a @xmath4 minimum ended in the @xmath40 coin .",
    "we also optimized the geometry of the uracilyl radical in the @xmath19 ( @xmath46 ) state figure  [ fig : geoms ] h ; this optimization was constrained to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in order to allow for sensible results with adc(2 ) .",
    "all optimized geometries can be found in the supporting information .",
    "based on the geometries , the following three chains of liic scans were generated : ( i ) @xmath13 min ",

    "@xmath19 min ",

    "the energies along these liic paths were recomputed with ms - caspt2(20,14 ) and adc(2 ) , yielding the curves presented in figure  [ fig : liic ] . at ms - caspt2 level",
    ", ground state relaxation ( figure  [ fig : liic ]  a ) can be achieved by a barrierless , descending path from the franck - condon region to the @xmath41 coin .",
    "this coin is related to a molecular geometry with strong ring puckering ( depicted in figure  [ fig : geoms ]  e ) , as already reported for other pyrimidine nucleobases.@xcite as the bright state is the @xmath19 at this level , no other state crossing is involved , which should make ground state relaxation an important and efficient relaxation route .",
    "noteworthy , our calculations do not show the barrier reported by kobyecka et al.,@xcite probably because they employed casscf - based minimum energy paths , whereas we performed optimizations at the higher ms - caspt2 level of theory .        in figure",
    "[ fig : liic ]  b , it can be see that isc in 5bu involves first switching from the bright @xmath4 state to the @xmath1 state .",
    "subsequently , close to the nearly planar @xmath1 minimum ( figure  [ fig : geoms ]  b ) a near - degeneracy region with the @xmath2 state can be reached through a slight pyramidalization at carbon atom c@xmath49 ( figure  [ fig : geoms ] f and g ) .",
    "note that in this region , the lowest triplet states are exchanged , with @xmath2 being @xmath28 , unlike at the franck - condon geometry .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states amounts to approximately 60  @xmath50 at this point , allowing for isc .",
    "decay to the lowest triplet minimum ( @xmath2 ) , which shows a boat - like ring conformation ( figure  [ fig : geoms ]  c ) like in uracil and thymine,@xcite is possible through the nearby @xmath45 coin .",
    "the energy of the @xmath2 , 2.9  ev , fits very well with the 3.0  ev onset of the phosphorescence spectrum of 5bu.@xcite the isc route in 5bu is reminiscent of the one found in u@xcite and t,@xcite where also the @xmath1 minimum is the gateway for population of the triplet manifold , due to the presence of the nearby @xmath43 mxp and @xmath45 coin ( compare figures  [ fig : geoms ]  b , f , and g ) . also of interest is the observation that from the @xmath1 minimum the system could easily cross back to the @xmath4 state and subsequently deactivate to the ground state , as was already proposed in the literature for u and t.@xcite    we note that the spin - orbit couplings in 5bu are not much stronger than in u or t , although one might have expected this from the heavy - atom effect of the bromine atom .",
    "the relatively weak spin - orbit couplings can be explained by the fact that neither the @xmath1 nor the @xmath2 excitations involve significantly the bromine orbitals . due to the properties of the spin - orbit hamiltonian , very large spin - orbit couplings",
    "could only be expected if the two involved states differ in one orbital localized at the heavy bromine atom .",
    "for example , the coupling between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states amounts to 860  @xmath50 at the franck - condon geometry .",
    "however , these strong interactions are only relevant at higher energies , but do not play a role after excitation to the @xmath19 .",
    "hence , in the low - energy range , isc in 5bu should not be significantly different than isc in u.    in figure  [ fig : liic ]  c , the potential energy curves suggest that in order to initiate photodissociation , the system would need to switch from the bright @xmath4 state to the dissociative @xmath46 state . at least in the shown scan , this involves a barrier of 0.2  ev .",
    "moreover , the barrier might become larger after the molecule relaxes in the @xmath4 state . in this regard ,",
    "a transition state search based on ms - caspt2 potentials would be helpful .",
    "unfortunately , the minimum energy path presented in ref .   is not , since this path was optimized using casscf(12,10 ) , with an active space that excludes the @xmath53 orbitals .",
    "this makes the dissociative @xmath54 state the lowest state in their optimization ( according to our reproduction of their calculation ) , explaining why their minimum - energy path was dissociative .",
    "instead , we expect that a minimum - energy path using the @xmath4 gradients ( e.g. , at the ms - caspt2 level ) would not show dissociation , but rather approaches the @xmath41 coin .",
    "dissociation could in principle also happen from the @xmath1 minimum or via the triplet states , as experimentally observed in solution by swanson et al.@xcite the @xmath1 minimum has a higher energy than the dissociation limit ( according to figure  [ fig : liic ]  c ) , but we expect that there exists some barrier due to the avoided crossing between @xmath1 and the dissociative states .",
    "dissociation in the triplet state should be hampered by the low energy of the @xmath20 minimum ( 0.7  ev below the dissociation limit ) , and hence would need to occur from an unrelaxed triplet .",
    "the bottom row of figure  [ fig : liic ] ( panels d , e , and f ) presents the equivalent paths obtained from the adc(2)/def2-tzvp calculations . for ground state relaxation ( figure  [ fig : liic ]  d ) ,",
    "the path involves the @xmath39 coin , because the bright state at adc(2 ) level is wrongly the @xmath10 .",
    "this state reordering could increase the probability to switch to the @xmath1 state during decay , but otherwise , adc(2 ) agrees with ms - caspt2 in that the ground state relaxation path is barrierless .",
    "regarding the isc path ( figure  [ fig : liic ]  e ) , the most important feature of the adc(2 ) curves is the low energy of the @xmath1 minimum relative to the @xmath39 crossing ( in contrast to the ms - caspt2 result , where the minimum is only 0.1  ev below the crossing ) . at the adc(2 ) level , this would probably lead to population trapping in the @xmath1 minimum with subsequent isc , whereas recrossing to the @xmath4 state would be strongly suppressed .",
    "however , isc itself seems to be well described at the adc(2 ) level , with the @xmath42 crossing energetically close to the @xmath1 minimum .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : liic ]  f shows the potential curves for photodissociation at adc(2 ) level of theory . because adc(2 ) is a single - reference method and can not properly describe the full dissociation , we only present the energy scan for the c - br bond length from 1.9    up to 2.8    ( see figure  [ fig : geoms ]  h ) . despite the restricted scan , one can still study the barrier between the @xmath4 and @xmath46 states , and obtain an estimate of the dissociation energy .",
    "from the scan in figure  [ fig : liic ]  f , it can be seen that adc(2 ) qualitatively agrees with ms - caspt2 , giving a barrier of 0.2  ev , which is due to the avoided crossing between @xmath4 and @xmath46 .",
    "because at the adc(2 ) level the @xmath1 and triplet minima are quite low in energy , dissociation would be even less likely than at ms - caspt2 level .",
    "based on the ms - caspt2 results , we can therefore propose that ground state relaxation should be the predominant relaxation route of 5bu in gas phase .",
    "however , the close proximity of the bright @xmath4 state to the @xmath1 state could lead to some population transfer into the latter state .",
    "due to the favorable location of the @xmath42 crossing , it is then conceivable that some isc occurs .",
    "dissociation is disfavored due to the barrier needed to overcome before populating the dissociative @xmath46 or @xmath55 states .",
    "these findings do not fully agree with the conclusions drawn by blancafort and coworkers,@xcite who proposed that in 5bu homolytic c - br cleavage and relaxation to the ground state are in close competition , based on sa - casscf calculations .",
    "while the presented static quantum chemistry calculations reveal some new details on the excited - state behavior of 5bu , it would be also advantageous to perform excited - state dynamics simulations , to obtain excited - state lifetimes or branching ratios between the relaxation channels .",
    "ideally , dynamics simulations in this case should be carried out with our reference method ms - caspt2(20,14 ) ; however , this method is clearly too expensive for dynamics . even with the smaller active space cas(12,9 ) employed for the optimizations , computing nuclear gradients for ms - caspt2 remains very costly .",
    "moreover , td - dft has been known to severely overestimate the energies of non - planar geometries in nucleobases.@xcite for 5bu , we attempted to optimize the @xmath41 coin using the two td - dft methods from table  [ tab : vertexc ] , and found energy barriers of at least 2  ev from the franck - condon region to the coin , showing the inadequacy of these methods .",
    "currently , the only practical choices to run sharc simulations are casscf and mrcis .",
    "the shared weakness of both methods is their significant overestimation of the @xmath4 energies , which in this particular case can prevent ground state relaxation and enhance dissociation . from table  [",
    "tab : vertexc ] it is clear that this overestimation is even more severe in casscf than in mrcis . whereas at casscf level , the bright @xmath4 state is 0.6  ev above the dissociative @xmath46 state , mrcis predicts @xmath4 to be 0.1  ev below @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , as reviewed in ref .",
    ", for u and t casscf predicts significant trapping in the @xmath4 state , which is also not consistent with ms - caspt2 calculations.@xcite hence , while both mrcis and casscf do not fully agree with the ms - caspt2 results , mrcis is still clearly the preferable choice among those two options .    in order to investigate",
    "which parts of the pess of 5bu can be described reasonably at the mrcis level of theory , we also performed the liic calculations with this method . as expected ,",
    "dissociation is not properly described ( not shown ) , with a nearly barrierless path from the franck - condon region to the dissociation limit .",
    "furthermore , due to the high energy of the @xmath4 state , the coin between @xmath13 and @xmath4 is not as accessible as it should be , and relaxation to the ground state is hampered .",
    "the isc pathway appears to be qualitatively correct .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : liic_mrcis ] , the isc pathway at mrcis level is very similar to the one at adc(2 ) level . in particular , after excitation to the bright @xmath4 ( @xmath10 ) state , the system first needs to cross from @xmath4 to @xmath1 at the corresponding @xmath39 coin and then relax to the @xmath1 minimum .",
    "there , a barrier of 0.1  ev needs to be surmounted to reach a crossing with the @xmath2 ( which is the adiabatic @xmath28 state at this point ) with socs of about 55  @xmath50 , allowing isc to take place .",
    "once transferred to the @xmath28 state , the system can relax through the @xmath56 coin to the @xmath2 minimum , located on the adiabatic @xmath20 .",
    "hence , we conclude that trajectories at the mrcis level of theory will be able to properly sample the isc pathway of 5bu , although unfortunately they will only provide qualitative aspects of the deactivation mechanism , because the ground state relaxation and dissociation pathways are under- and over - represented , respectively .",
    "b and e , but for the mrcis(10,8 ) level of theory . ]          in order to prepare the initial conditions for the excited - state dynamics , we first simulated the absorption spectrum of 5bu , based on a distribution of geometries representing the ground state vibrational state . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec]a , b we show the simulated spectrum , as obtained with ms - caspt2(20,14 ) and mrcis , respectively . as expected from the single point calculation at the equilibrium geometry , the ms - caspt2 spectrum ( depicted in figure  [ fig : spec]a ) shows an absorption band centered at approximately 4.3  ev , due to the bright @xmath0 ( @xmath19 ) state .",
    "the character of the involved states , shown in figures [ fig : spec]c , was analyzed by calculating wave function overlaps to the states at the equilibrium geometry ; these overlaps allow to compare states for hundreds of calculations without individually inspecting the orbital and expansion coefficients.@xcite this analysis showed that for the large majority of sampled geometries ( figure  [ fig : spec]c ) , @xmath19 has @xmath0 character and @xmath10 has @xmath22 character , whereas for the higher states the character varies with geometry , e.g. , the @xmath54 state which is distributed between the @xmath10-@xmath57 .",
    "comparing the spectrum to experimental spectra , we find that the ms - caspt2 calculations qualitatively reproduce the first absorption band of 5bu , but the sampling has shifted the peak to slightly lower energies than those predicted experimentally.@xcite    the mrcis spectrum , shown in figure  [ fig : spec]b , presents a peak centered at 5.9  ev , arising from the spectroscopically active @xmath0 state , which is either @xmath10 or @xmath11 depending on the initial geometry .",
    "this peak is shifted by 1.6  ev with respect to the ms - caspt2 spectrum , as expected from the vertical excitation calculations ( see table  [ tab : vertexc ] ) . at almost all geometries",
    ", @xmath19 is the dark @xmath1 state ( figure  [ fig : spec]d ) , explaining why @xmath19 does not contribute to the spectrum .",
    "instead , the absorption band is dominated by the bright @xmath4 state , which is distributed between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states .",
    "contributions to the @xmath54 dissociative state can also be found in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    as with the vertical excitation energies , the comparison of the mrcis spectrum with experimental data@xcite suffers from the major drawback that the energy of the @xmath0 transition is blue - shifted at the mrcis(10,8)/cc - pvdz - dk level of theory .",
    "however , we note that for the majority of initial conditions , the bright @xmath4 state is below the dissociative @xmath46 state . this should limit the amount of artificial dissociation so that still a number of trajectories can sample the other relaxation pathways , in particular isc",
    ".      we shall start the discussion of the nonadiabatic dynamics data with the results obtained from an analysis of the kinetic constants .",
    "as a general finding , about a third of the propagated trajectories ( 23 of 78 ) undergo c - br bond dissociation within 400  fs .",
    "clearly , this dissociation quantum yield is farfetched in comparison with the experimental few - percent yields,@xcite due to the level of theory employed in the dynamics . from the highly accurate ms - caspt2 results",
    ", no ultrafast dissociation should be expected in gas phase after @xmath4 excitation .",
    "therefore , we do not further discuss those trajectories that dissociated ; only the 55  non - dissociating trajectories are included in the following analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : pop ] presents the temporal evolution of the excited - state populations and the results of the kinetic analysis .",
    "the populations were fitted to a sequential kinetic model with two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which we identify as the internal conversion ( ic ) and isc time constants , respectively .",
    "errors for the parameters were obtained with the bootstrapping method,@xcite in order to judge whether the number of trajectories is sufficient to describe these processes .",
    "we obtain @xmath60  fs , meaning that the @xmath61 population transfer is about 70% after 100  fs ( see the @xmath19 line in figure  [ fig : pop ] ) .",
    "note that this is substantially different to the results reported for uracil and thymine in previous sa - casscf - based dynamics simulations , where much less was transferred within 100  fs , because longer time constants were obtained for this pathway.@xcite this difference is due to the fact that at sa - casscf level the @xmath4 state is higher in energy than with mrcis , and therefore population transfer from @xmath4 to @xmath1 is slower at sa - casscf level .    the second time constant we obtain is @xmath62  fs .",
    "that is , within 400  fs , 51% of the non - dissociating trajectories have moved to the triplet states and 49% are still in the singlet manifold .",
    "the calculated isc time scale matches well with the 0.4  ps time constant reported in ref .   for time - resolved pump - probe experiments ( 266  nm pump and 330  nm probe ) on 5bu in water . in the same experiment",
    ", they also observe a nanosecond component , which could be assigned to the population trapped in the triplet states .",
    "interestingly , the time constant of 450  fs obtained for isc in 5bu is smaller than those previously reported for u and t,@xcite which are approximately 800  fs and 900  fs , respectively .",
    "the factor of two in the isc time constant is due to subtle differences in the excited - state pess , due to the presence of the bromine atom , and ultimately because a different level of theory has been used in the previous simulations.@xcite otherwise , the general isc mechanism in 5bu , t , and u is the same and also the spin - orbit couplings have approximately the same size .",
    "however , while the isc time constant appears to be reasonable , the overall triplet yield is clearly overestimated , because a large fraction of the trajectories should undergo relaxation to @xmath13 before isc can occur . in our simulations , this relaxation is blocked by the large barrier to recross back to the @xmath4 and to reach the @xmath40 coin .",
    "consequently , for the simulated time , the mrcis - based dynamics does not result in trajectories undergoing relaxation to the ground state , as was suspected from the static calculations .",
    "these results show that a relevant deactivation pathway of 5bu should be ultrafast isc . in particular , the results of the interpolation scans in figure  [ fig : liic ] and [ fig : liic_mrcis ] are reminiscent to the situation reported for u and t,@xcite where also from the bright @xmath4 state the system can deactivate to the dark @xmath19 ( @xmath22 ) state .",
    "this state is the doorway for isc into the @xmath2 state , in accordance with the el - sayed rules.@xcite for 5bu , this isc mechanism is in agreement with experimental data,@xcite which report isc from an @xmath1 to a @xmath2 state .",
    "the involved geometries differ from the ground state geometry by compressions and elongations along the c = o bonds and deformations of the ring .",
    "we performed accurate vertical excitation calculations and potential energy surface explorations for 5-bromouracil ( 5bu ) , in order to investigate the possible excited - state dynamics of this molecule .",
    "the vertical excitation calculations showed that ms - caspt2 with an active space of 20  electrons in 14  orbitals gives excitation energies in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "in particular , the lowest excited states are the bright @xmath4 state , a dark @xmath1 state , and a dissociative @xmath46 state at slightly higher energies .",
    "these three states are responsible for the three plausible photophysical reaction pathways of 5bu , according to ms - caspt2 .",
    "a barrierless pathway on the @xmath4 state leads directly to a conical intersection with the @xmath13 , allowing for efficient relaxation to the ground state .",
    "alternatively , another conical intersection allows the interconversion of @xmath4 into @xmath63 , from where intersystem crossing to the @xmath2 state can commence .",
    "third , after surmounting a barrier of at least 0.2  ev , the molecule could switch from @xmath4 to @xmath64 , which would lead to the homolytic dissociation of the c - br bond . out of these three pathways ,",
    "ms - caspt2 identifies relaxation to @xmath13 as the most probable pathway in gas phase .",
    "we also investigated the performance of different electronic structure methods in describing the deactivation of 5bu , including adc(2 ) , td - bp886 , td - b3lyp , sa - casscf , and mrcis .",
    "all of these methods represent significantly lower - cost alternatives to the expensive ms - caspt2 computations performed . from the excitation energies and potential energy surfaces ,",
    "adc(2 ) seems to give the best results in agreement with the ms - caspt2 reference calculations .",
    "the dft - based methods fail especially in describing the ground state relaxation pathway .",
    "sa - casscf and mrcis , on the other hand , notably overestimate the energy of the @xmath4 state , which makes dissociation more likely and ground state relaxation less likely . for technical constraints ,",
    "mrcis was chosen to perform nonadiabatic dynamics simulations coupled to sharc , a variant of the trajectory surface hopping method that can treat intersystem crossing .",
    "we found that intersystem crossing is mediated by the @xmath1 state and occurs with a time constant of @xmath65  fs , showing that this process is ultrafast in 5bu , as already discussed in recent literature on pyrimidine bases.@xcite unfortunately , the trajectories do not allow obtaining yields for the competitive photophysical pathways of 5bu , due to the shortcomings of mrcis .",
    "the present study clearly shows that the proper description of the excited - state dynamics of 5bu is very challenging , and requires a multiconfigurational electronic structure method with a large active space , in order to account for all different , competing relaxation pathways .",
    "moreover , previous experiments were conducted in condensed phase , and the applications of 5bu involve the photoactive molecule in a complex biological environment , and the inclusion of such environments would add another level of complexity to future computations .",
    "the authors declare no competing interests .",
