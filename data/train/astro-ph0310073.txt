    "we have determined full  polarization properties of 48 pulsars at 430 mhz from arecibo observatory . this paper presents the principal results of these measurements  faraday rotation and interstellar magnetic field determinations , and polarized profiles and pulsar morphological classifications .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the remainder of the introduction , we summarize the background on these two primary results .",
    "the second section of the paper describes the observations and our analyses of them .",
    "the third section discusses our faraday rotation and galactic magnetic field results in detail , while the fourth describes the polarized profiles and morphological classifications .",
    "conclusions are given in the fifth section .",
    "pulsars are ideal probes of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "faraday rotation measurements of pulsars linearly polarized emissions yield the rotation measure , @xmath1 , which is a path integral along the line of sight involving the magnetic field @xmath5 and electron density @xmath6 :    @xmath7    while pulse timing measurements determine the dispersion measure , @xmath8 , which is another path integral along the line of sight involving electron density @xmath6 alone :    @xmath9    consequently the mean value of the component of the magnetic field along the line of sight , @xmath10 , is given by :    @xmath11    the galactic magnetic field structure is particularly amenable to study with pulsars because of this relationship , which can be evaluated with pulsars at various distances along a particular line of sight .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide recent comprehensive analyses of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "@xcite proposed a morphological pulsar classification scheme that was based on examination of multifrequency , polarized pulse profiles .",
    "rankin found that there are two principal classes of emission beams  core and conal , whose properties are distinguishable through careful analysis of polarized properties as a function of frequency .",
    "she and others have applied her classification criteria to large number of pulsars in subsequent papers ( rankin 1986 , 1990 , 1993 ; rankin , stinebring , & weisberg 1989 ; weisberg et al 1999 ) . in the current paper",
    ", we measure a large number of polarized profiles at 430 mhz , and use them and earlier multifrequency measurements to make new morphological classifications and to improve old ones .",
    "the data were gathered with the dual  circularly polarized 430 mhz linefeed at arecibo observatory . a 5 mhz band centered at 430 mhz",
    "was fed into the arecibo correlator , and 32 lags of auto and cross  correlation functions were formed every @xmath12 . using an ephemeris for the apparent pulsar period generated by program tempo @xcite to calculate the pulsar rotational phase at the epoch of each such sample , we selected one of 1024 pulse longitude bins to accumulate the resulting four correlation functions .",
    "this procedure continued for 120 seconds of observing . off ",
    "line , the four correlation functions at each longitude bin were three ",
    "level corrected and fourier transformed to form pulse profiles in the four stokes parameters .",
    "this procedure was essentially identical to that used in the 21 cm observations of @xcite , except that the 430 mhz linefeed limited the bandwidth to a narrower range .",
    "at this point in the processing , the data consisted of a cube of 1024 longitude bins x 4 stokes parameters x 32 frequency channels of 156.25 khz bandwidth , representing a two minute integration or `` scan . ''",
    "observationally speaking , the faraday rotation measure @xmath1 is conventionally expressed as a rotation of the linearly polarized position angle @xmath13 as a function of _ wavelength _ @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath1 has units of rad m@xmath16 .",
    "the rate of rotation with wavelength is then @xmath17 it is more convenient for us initially to measure it as a position angle rotation rate with _ frequency _ :",
    "@xmath18    at our center frequency of 430 mhz , then , the conversion between rotation rate @xmath19 and @xmath1 is simply @xmath20 so we will use the two quantities interchangeably in what follows .",
    "the linearly polarized position angle @xmath13 suffers a significant net rotation across the 32 frequency channels owing to interstellar and ionospheric faraday rotation plus an instrumental position angle rotation term , respectively : @xmath21 in order to determine the interstellar component of the rotation and hence the interstellar magnetic field , and also to produce polarized pulse profiles not suffering significant linear depolarization , we next determined the net position angle rotation rate across the bandpass @xmath22 and _ derotated _ the linear polarization at each frequency by this amount .    to measure this position angle rotation rate with frequency , we performed two successively finer grid searches at a given longitude bin , as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lvssweep ] ) .",
    "first we chose each of 260 trial @xmath13 derotation rates corresponding to @xmath1s between @xmath23 rad m@xmath16 , and then summed the derotated linear stokes parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 across the 32 frequency channels .",
    "our first estimate of net derotation rate of position angle with frequency was the one that maximized @xmath26 in this first trial process .",
    "then we recentered the search on this first estimate ; and did 11 trial @xmath13 derotation rates corresponding to @xmath1s within @xmath27 rad m@xmath16 of this value .",
    "we then fitted a parabola to the peak of the latter curve . the adopted derotation rate of position angle with frequency , @xmath28 , was the one that maximized @xmath26 in this process .",
    "the procedure was repeated at every longitude bin for which there was significant linearly polarized power ( typically @xmath29 ) , and a weighted average derotation for the two  minute scan , @xmath30 , was then computed from the results at each longitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pavslong ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty was taken to be the standard deviation of the mean .    to extract the interstellar faraday rotation from the measured @xmath31 , it is necessary to subtract the ionospheric and instrumental contributions ( _ cf .",
    "8) . to estimate the ionospheric rotation measure , we integrated a time  dependent model of the ionospheric electron density [ international reference ionosphere 1995 ; @xcite ] and geomagnetic field [ international geomagnetic reference field 1995 ; @xcite ] through the ionosphere along the arecibo  pulsar line of sight , yielding typical @xmath32 rad m@xmath16 .",
    "the instrumental rotation rate across the bandpass was assumed to be constant during each given daily session , and was taken as the weighted difference between our measured rotation measures and the published values for six `` @xmath1 calibrator pulsars . '' ( the uncertainty in this quantity is the standard deviation of the mean difference . ) consequently our values depend on the correctness of previously published results and their constancy over time .",
    "our calibrator list initially included every one of our pulsars that additionally had a published @xmath1 value .",
    "it quickly became clear that most of the published values were not correct at our observing epoch , as they did not yield an instumental rotation consistent with other pulsars .",
    "we finally arrived at our final list of only six `` @xmath1 calibrator pulsars '' ( see table 1 ) whose published @xmath1 s could be reconciled with our observations .    after determining the ionospheric and instrumental rotation rates as described above , we derived interstellar rotation measures for each 2minute scan for all of our pulsars via eqn .",
    "our final measured interstellar @xmath1 for each pulsar was the weighted average of these results .",
    "comparison of our resulting `` measured '' interstellar @xmath1 s with the published values for the calibrator pulsars constitutes a closed - loop test of our calibration system , as we processed these pulsars identically as the others we observed .",
    "note that our `` measured '' values indeed agree with the published values for these pulsars to within the errors .",
    "( see table 1 . ) the many other pulsars published @xmath1 s that disagree with our measurements will be discussed below .",
    "the weighted average position angle derotation @xmath30 was applied to the stokes parameter profiles at each of the 32 contiguous frequencies , and they were then summed to form a polarized profile for the scan .",
    "each scan on a given pulsar was crosscorrelated in two dimensions with a high @xmath33 full  stokes profile template , in order to shift it in time and position angle before accumulating it into a `` grand average . ''",
    "specifically , we first cross  correlated the total power @xmath34 scan and template as a function of longitude to obtain the time offset of each scan with respect to the template , and we rotated the scan s polarized profile in time by this amount .",
    "next , we crosscorrelated the linearly polarized @xmath35 scan and template profiles as a function of position angle offset to determine the best offset in @xmath13 between them , and we then rotated the scan s linearly polarized position angle by this amount .",
    "finally , the time and position angle  registered profile was accumulated into a grand average waveform , as shown in figs .",
    "we use the ieee convention for defining circular polarization @xcite , in which left circularly polarized radiation is defined as that which is transmitted and received by a left - handed helix . the stokes parameter @xmath36 .",
    "we estimate that in the worst cases , @xmath37 could be systematically in error by @xmath38 of @xmath39 due to the difficulty in calibrating left versus right circularly polarized radiometer channels via standard source observations in crowded fields .",
    "additional possible errors in @xmath37 of up to @xmath40 due to instrumental polarization were averaged down in most cases by multiple observations .",
    "these data were gathered in seven daily observing sessions from 1991 december through 1992 december .",
    "the profile resolution is @xmath41 of the pulse period , or @xmath42 . for the weaker pulsars ,",
    "the profile is boxcar  smoothed .",
    "if such smoothing was done , the number of channels in the boxcar is listed in the figure caption .    for those pulsars exhibiting little or no linear polarization , it is possible that an incorrectly determined rotation measure has depolarized any intrinsic linear polarization . however , our rotation measure finding algorithm should have found the correct @xmath1 if indeed there was sufficient @xmath33 in @xmath26 .",
    "in the following sections , we present our new @xmath1 measurements .",
    "we then study both time variations in @xmath1 , and the large  scale structure of galactic magnetic fields .",
    "table 2 lists our rotation measures , previously published values ( where available ) , and the difference between them .",
    "note that many of our determinations differ from earlier measurements by more than the joint uncertainties , suggesting that time variations are common .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also list several pulsars having @xmath1s varying by several rad m@xmath16 on timescales of years .    eq .",
    "3 shows that @xmath1 variations might result either from magnetic field or electron density variations ( or both ) .",
    "it is possible to test for the level of electron density variations if multiepoch dispersion measure ( @xmath8 ) values are available . while some pulsar @xmath8s show very small time variations ( phillips & wolszczan 1991 ; backer et al 1993 ) , others vary by several percent on these timescales @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath1s and @xmath8s tended to vary in a correlated fashion , while @xcite detected a change in the @xmath1 of psr b0329 + 54 without accompanying @xmath8 variations .",
    "fortunately , we are able to investigate possible sources for the @xmath1 changes in our pulsars because @xcite measured @xmath8s of many of them at approximately the same epoch as we gathered our @xmath1 data .",
    "table 3 displays their and earlier @xmath8 measurements on many of our @xmath1 pulsars .",
    "it is clear from comparison of the percentage changes in tables 2 and 3 that @xmath1s tend to vary far more on a several  year timescale than do @xmath8s .",
    "consequently it is evident that electron density variations are not responsible for the bulk of the @xmath1 changes .    of course pulsars embedded in supernova remnants such as vela and the crab nebula ,",
    "show large variations of both @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( hamilton et al 1985 ; rankin et al 1988 ) .",
    "the largest difference in table 2 between previously published and our measured @xmath1s is for psr j1532 + 2745=b1530 + 27 , which does not lie in an snr .",
    "we have no other explanation for the discrepancy .",
    "multiple observations at several of our observing epochs confirm our @xmath1 result on this pulsar .    while it appears from the above arguments that the temporal changes in @xmath1 must result from interstellar magnetic field variations , caution is required .",
    "recent work by @xcite shows that large variations in @xmath1 as a function of pulse phase are seen in some pulsars .",
    "( our error analysis procedure accounts for these variations , so that our tabulated values and uncertainties in @xmath1s reflect this phenomenon . ) @xcite also demonstrate that this ( spurious ) apparent @xmath1 variation with pulse phase can result from average  pulse measurements of a pulsar having a quasi ",
    "orthogonal polarization mode emission process .",
    "time variations in apparent @xmath1 could then result from the balance of the two modes shifting slightly over time , rather than from interstellar magnetic field changes .      in the following sections , we use our new pulsar @xmath1 data in conjunction with previously measured values [ summarized in @xcite and supplemented by recent measurements of @xcite ] to probe the galactic magnetic field structure in selected directions .",
    "global analyses can be found in @xcite and @xcite . while the random component of the field is comparable to or even larger than the systematic structure @xcite ; we focus here on the systematic part . in order to investigate the field as a function of location in the galaxy",
    ", we use the ne2001 electron density model @xcite and the pulsar dispersion measure @xmath8 to determine the distance to each pulsar studied . in most cases , we select wedges of longitude along the galactic plane for our studies , setting the longitude boundaries to isolate global magnetic field structures .",
    "( in all cases we have limited our studies to those pulsars with galactic latitudes @xmath43 ) .",
    "in one case where a wedge can not segregate the desired magnetic structure , we instead select a region lying within a given distance range of a particular spiral arm . while the ne2001 model yields distances with typical uncertainties of some tens of percent , the _ relative _ distances of various pulsars should be roughly correct within sufficiently small zones .",
    "since the rotation measure @xmath1 is a path integral of the magnetic field , a steady large  scale field will tend to appear as a constant _ slope _",
    "( modulo changes in @xmath6 ) in plots of @xmath1 versus distance , and a magnetic field reversal will lead to a change in the _ sign _ of the slope .",
    "note also from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that a positive ( negative ) @xmath1 indicates that the radio signal is propagating parallel ( antiparallel ) to the field .",
    "to set the overall context while invesigating particular zones , the reader may examine a map of the galactic plane plotting all known low ",
    "latitude pulsar @xmath1s ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : globalfield ] ) , with superposed global field directions deduced from this work .",
    "this figure also displays the spiral arms as presented by @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to analyze a magnetic field reversal when the reversal lies along a line oriented close to , but not parallel to , the line of sight .",
    "looking at pulsar @xmath1s within a longitude wedge in this situation can be misleading because the reversal does not lie at a unique longitude .",
    "pulsars at similar longitudes and distances from the sun , but on opposite sides of a reversal , may have drastically different @xmath1s . consequently in this situation",
    "we use different selection criteria than longitude .",
    "it is useful to select pulsars within some given distance range from the nearest spiral arm in order to examine whether the magnetic field reversal follows the galactic spiral pattern . with suitable adjustment of this distance window",
    ", we can see magnetic field effects for a very narrow and precise region of the interstellar medium near the spiral arms .",
    "for example we can investigate whether a reversal does indeed lie at a constant distance from a spiral arm .",
    "the rotation measure depends upon four quantities , as seen from eq .",
    "( 1 )  distance , @xmath44 , and the angle between the propagation vector and the magnetic field .",
    "hence it is important to note that plots of @xmath1 against distance can not by themselves discriminate among the several factors that may affect @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion holds whether one selects pulsars within either a wedge or a strip of the galaxy .",
    "the field reversal thought to exist several hundred pc inside the solar circle ( thomson & nelson 1980 ; han & qiao 1994 ; rand & lyne 1994 ) is such a case .",
    "the field is clockwise near the sun when viewed from above ; inside the reversal it changes to counterclockwise from above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : globalfield ] ) .",
    "@xcite found negligible @xmath1s throughout the wedge @xmath45 for all pulsars within about 5 kpc of the sun , and attributed the null to a large  scale field reversal .",
    "their result is no longer supportable with the larger number of measurements accumulated since then .",
    "in fact we find that there is _ no _ unique _ longitude _ range in this vicinity that traces the null for great distances .",
    "however , for the _ strip _ lying approximately midway between the local arm and the sagittarius ( next inner ) arm toward @xmath46 specifically from ( 1.01.5 ) kpc outside the sagittarius arm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : atopreversal ] ) , we find that @xmath1s cluster near zero for the first 7 kpc from the sun . because these pulsars are at varying distances from the sun ( from 0.3 to nearly 7 kpc )",
    ", we must be looking along an actual null in the magnetic field extending for @xmath2 kpc . in this case , instead of surmising the existence of a reversal on the basis of _ trends _ in the sign of @xmath1 , we clearly see the reversal itself .",
    "we also find that if we widen the zone much beyond our current limits , the @xmath1s tend systematically away from zero as expected on opposite sides of a reversal .",
    "( see below for details . )",
    "therefore it appears that the null is confined to a width of less than 0.5 kpc over the 7 kpc range .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this null , whose location is now by far the best  known for any large  scale field reversal in the galaxy , clearly lies midway _ between _ arms rather than along one .",
    "the rapid , systematic rise in @xmath1 for @xmath47 kpc signals that the null no longer lies @xmath48 kpc outside the sagittarius arm here .",
    "unfortunately , there are not enough pulsars with measured @xmath1s near and beyond here to map out exactly what is happening in this vicinity , but we note that the local arm is presumed to end and the perseus ( next outer ) arm also approaches closer to the sagittarius arm near here .",
    "presumably these global galactic structures are perturbing the well  behaved pattern that we were able to trace out for a considerable distance up to this location .",
    "@xmath1 measurements of additional , more distant pulsars in this direction will help to clarify the situation .",
    "we have also investigated the local reversal in the opposite direction , i.e. , toward @xmath49 .",
    "the reversal is not nearly as well  defined , but in general the trend is consistent with what is found toward @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : globalfield ] ) : the local field reversal midway between the local arm and the next arm interior to it ( sagittarius ) separates clockwise fields near the local arm from counterclockwise fields near the next interior one ; causing predominantly positive @xmath1s in the former case and negative ones in the latter .",
    "the few counterexamples probably result from faraday screens along particular lines of sight , a point emphasized by @xcite .",
    "the overall field structure at large distances toward @xmath50 is unknown because of perturbations caused by the gum nebula .",
    "we next investigate the field lying in three 1kpc wide strips interior to the nearby field reversal .",
    "the first segment selects pulsars from the reversal inward to the sagittarius arm .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stripeminus1 ] . )",
    "note the clear trend of increasing @xmath1 with distance , which indicates that the field is relatively steady in this region .",
    "the narrow wedge from @xmath51 , whose inner edge cuts just inside the sagittarius arm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:42to52 ] ) , also illustrates that the field from the local reversal in to sagittarius arm is approximately steady , as there is again a regular trend of increasing @xmath1 with distance .",
    "most extragalactic sources in this direction exhibit @xmath52 rad m@xmath16 @xcite , so there is no evidence for additional major reversals beyond the pulsars .",
    "the second strip interior to the local field reversal selects pulsars from the sagittarius arm to 1 kpc on its interior side .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stripeminus2 ] . )",
    "the general trend of @xmath1 with distance in this strip is similar to that in the first region . as @xmath1 is a path integral",
    "quantity , this similarity suggests that a second low ",
    "field region ( i.e. , a second reversal ) is being traversed somewhat interior to the sagittarius arm .",
    "the farther pulsars in these two strips tend to show _ higher _ @xmath1s because their signals propagate more nearly parallel to the field .    the third strip interior to the local reversal , ( see fig .  [ fig : stripeminus3 ] ) , which encompasses the scutum arm , shows more negative @xmath1s than the first and second strips , especially at larger distances .",
    "this indicates that these pulsars signals begin their journey through a sufficiently long region of clockwise field near the pulsar , before reaching the second reversal described above , to approximately nullify the opposite field along much of the rest of the path .",
    "( see the arrows on fig .",
    "[ fig:60to78 ] , which sketch the deduced field directions ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that our work suggests that both of the nulls / reversals lie between arms , while @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite indicate _",
    "maximal _ field magnitude in these regions .",
    "much of the discrepancy can be attributed to the new ne2001 electron density model bringing most pulsars closer to earth , while some of the change is due to adjustments in the location of the spiral arms themselves .",
    "[ @xcite find yet another ( third ) reversal even farther in , also near an arm  the norma arm .",
    "the latter @xmath1s have not yet been published so we are not able to study them with the aid of the new ne2001 model  determined distances . ]",
    "we next investigate the longitude range @xmath53 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:60to78 ] ] .",
    "the lower longitude limit of this wedge ensures that lines of sight remain exterior to the local reversal which lies just inside to the solar circle .",
    "the nearest several kpc of the wedge skim near or along the local arm .",
    "the @xmath1s near the sun grow more negative with distance out to @xmath54 kpc , as expected from a clockwise local magnetic field . yet in the range 6 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath55 8 kpc , @xmath1s are positive ; while _ extragalactic _ @xmath1s are again negative @xcite",
    ". consequently _ two _ field reversals , each corresponding to a change of slope in @xmath1 versus distance , are required at @xmath57 kpc and @xmath58 kpc , as indicated schematically on the figure .",
    "the nearer reversal is located interior to the perseus ( next outer ) arm ; the farther reversal somewhere beyond it . as in the interior galaxy",
    ", we find that reversals / nulls tend to occur between arms .",
    "( the field between these two exterior reversals , near the perseus arm , is counterclockwise [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : globalfield ] ] . )",
    "@xcitealso suggested that there may be two reversals exterior to the sun ; our contribution rests in providing several new measurements and in the application of the ne2001 model to estimate distances , both of which refine the arguments for two exterior reversals , at least in this direction .",
    "note however that there is no clear evidence for reversals toward or beyond the perseus arm at higher longitudes ( brown & taylor 2001 ; mitra et al 2002 ) .",

    "( in a few instances , linear @xmath59 and/or circular @xmath60 polarization is not displayed because it is too weak . )",

    "the classifications are based on the rankin ( 1983 ) morphological model , which has recently been further elucidated ( mitra & rankin 2002 ; rankin & ramachandran 2003 ) .",

    "@xcite successfully fitted a rotating vector model ( rvm ) to the 21 cm position angle data , further supporting a conal classification since rankin s model indicates that only conal emission is expected to exhibit the rvm .",
    "@xcite show that a central component appears at 102.5 mhz , as expected of a core .",
    "the circular polarization in our measurements and those of @xcite switches sign toward the latter of the two principal components .",
    "the @xcite 430 mhz arecibo observations show positive circular polarization throughout the profile , as do measurements at higher frequencies starting at 610 mhz @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the changes are due to instrumental polarization or temporal variations .",
    "@xcite note that some of the early arecibo polarimetry was flawed by the use of gaussian  shaped , rather than square , filters .",
    "@xcite suggested that the sign  changing circular polarization under the leading components at 21 cm indicated a possibly merged leading cone and core .",
    "this circular polarization signature is also seen at 1.6 ghz @xcite .",
    "however , our 430 mhz profile shows essentially _ no _ circular polarization under the leading ( and trailing ) components , and only positive @xmath37 through the middle regions .",
    "our linear polarization is significantly higher under the bridge than is seen at 21 cm .",
    "the position angle sweeps down under the bridge , and then jumps discontinuously at a null in @xmath26 , finally settling at a constant value in a small trailing component that is also barely evident at 21 cm @xcite .",
    "according to the rankin model , the central position angle traverse results from conal emission , which would indicate that our line of sight is tangent to the edge of a cone there .",
    "then the leading and ( weak ) trailing components could be emission from a second cone , although their linear polarization properties are not consonant with expected conal emission .",
    "@xcite show two principal components separated by @xmath63 at 102.5 mhz , _ less _ than at higher frequencies .",
    "consequently , the pulsar now fits less clearly into any rankin class .",
    "our profile differs from the 430 mhz profile of @xcite in that we see substantially more circular polarization under the second peak .",
    "@xcite note that the central bridge has some core  like properties , but they still support the @xcite double @xmath62 classification .",
    "the sucessful rvm fit of @xcite further supports this classification .",
    "most earlier work [ summarized in @xcite ] suggests that this is a core single @xmath64 .",
    "our profile has the opposite sign of circular polarization as do @xcite at the same frequency .",
    "recent 408 mhz polarized profiles by @xcite are similar to ours , so it appears that the sign of circular polarization is the same up through at least 10 ghz .",
    "our linear position angle shows three well  defined values under what appear to be three different pulse components .",
    "there is no evidence of an rvm  style position angle sweep .",
    "the @xcite 1.4 ghz linear profile shows a similar form in linear polarization and position angle sweep , though with larger amplitude in @xmath26 .",
    "[ @xcite were unable to measure @xmath26 in this pulsar at 1.4 ghz . ]",
    "the @xcite 410 mhz profile shows significantly more negative circular polarization past the profile peak than does ours .",
    "it is not clear if this discrepancy is due to calibration errors or to temporal changes in one of the profiles .",
    "( both profiles were measured roughly contemporaneously . )",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the multifrequency circular measurements of @xcite appear self ",
    "consistent up through 1.4 ghz , yet our measurements indicating negligible circular polarization also appear roughly self  consistent with our contemporaneous 1.4 ghz observations @xcite .    the best profiles at 0.4 and 1.4 ghz exhibit three distinct linearly polarized components , edge depolarization , and hints of sign  changing circular polarization under the ( not very prominent ) central component , arguing for a triple @xmath65 classification .",
    "at 102 mhz , @xcite show two principal components separated by @xmath66 , with a possible third trailing one at a similar separation .",
    "these data support the @xmath67 classification , as the outermost ( conal ) components have spread and the central ( core ) component dominates , as expected at low frequency .",

    "we have measured the stokes parameters of the postcursor [ discovered by @xcite ] for the first time .",
    "it is virtually @xmath68 linearly polarized , with a rather constant position angle that contrasts with the sweep of the main components @xmath13 .",

    "the 408 mhz profile of @xcite is similar to our main pulse profile , although its @xmath37 is closer to zero .",
    "careful analysis of our individual scans suggests that our @xmath37 may be influenced by instrumental polarization , so that the @xcite @xmath37 may be superior .",

    "<S> ( 2 ) steadily increasing @xmath1s in a 1kpc wide strip interior to the local field reversal , and also in the wedge bounded by @xmath3 , indicate that the large  scale field is approximately steady from the local reversal in to the sagittarius arm . </S>",

( 5 ) exterior to the nearby reversal , @xmath1s from @xmath4 show evidence for _ two _ reversals , on the near and far side of the perseus arm . ( 6 ) in general , the maxima in the large  scale fields tend to lie along the spiral arms , while the field minima tend to be found between them .    </S>",
