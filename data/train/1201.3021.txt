    "understanding the process of high - mass star formation represents a challenge from both a theoretical and observational point of view . by now",
    ", three main competing concepts of massive star formation have been discussed in the recent literature ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) : formation through coalescence of lower - mass stars in extremely dense stellar clusters @xcite ; monolithic collapse of isolated , turbulence supported cores @xcite ; and competitive accretion where the most massive protostars benefit of the gravitational well created by the lower - mass stars surrounding them , thus boosting the accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the available observational evidence is still inadequate to discern between these different scenarios , mostly because observations of massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) are complicated by the large distances of typically several kpc , implying small angular scales , and the fact that such objects are born still deeply enshrouded in dense dusty envelopes , opaque to optical and near - infrared wavelength radiation .    a possible way to distinguish between different models is to explore the physical conditions and the dynamical processes of the gas close to the protostars .",
    "however , present ( sub)millimeter interferometers and infrared ( ir ) telescopes attain angular resolutions @xmath3025 , corresponding to thousands of astronomical units ( au ) at the typical distances of mysos of several kpc .",
    "this is insufficient to investigate the kinematics of the gas in the immediate surroundings of the forming star , where crucial phenomena such as accretion , rotation , and ejection are likely most prominent .",
    "the above mentioned limitation can be bypassed by very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of maser lines , which attain linear resolutions of a few au .",
    "a few years ago , we started an observational project to study the high - mass star - forming process by comparing interferometric images of thermal lines of molecular tracers with multi - epoch vlbi studies in three well known maser species ( oh ,  and ) . at present , three sources ( iras20126@xmath44104 ,  and ) have been already analyzed @xcite .",
    "the results demonstrate that the synergy between vlbi , multi - species maser observations and ( sub)mm interferometric observations of thermal molecular lines is crucial to achieve a multi - scale picture of the environment of newly formed massive ( proto)stars . in the present article we report on our vlbi maser study of the high - mass star - forming region ( hmsfr ) , and compare our results with available complementary interferometric data of continuum and thermally excited molecular line emission , as well as with sub - arcsec resolution mid - ir images obtained with the cooled mid - infrared camera and spectrometer ( comics ) on the subaru telescope .",
    "in section  2 , we provide a review of previous observations toward this region .",
    "section  3 describes the vlbi observations of the maser transitions , the very large array ( vla ) observations of the radio continuum emission at 1.3  cm and 3.6  cm , and the mid - ir observations performed with the subaru / comics telescope . in section  4 , we present the distributions of the three types of masers , the water maser proper motions , and the properties of the radio continuum . the results are discussed in section  5 and the conclusions are drawn in section  6 .",
    "the hmsfr  ( alias iras18411@xmath50338 ) is located at a kinematic distance of 7.4  kpc6  kpc ) and the far ( @xmath69  kpc ) kinematical distance is not resolved @xcite , we adopt the distance to the tangent point . ]",

    "bolometer observations at 1.2  mm @xcite have detected a peak of dust continuum emission associated with the two mid - ir sources and the near - ir source .",
    "single - dish maps in the cs(54 ) and c@xmath11o(21 ) lines have revealed an arcmin - scale molecular clump and a monopolar ( red - shifted ) outflow is seen in the @xmath12co(21 ) line @xcite .",
    "single - dish surveys have detected emission in dense gas tracers as cs(76 ) , cs(21 ) , and cs(10 ) @xcite , and in the h110@xmath13 radio recombination line @xcite , which suggests the presence of a diffuse region .",
    "in addition , oh maser emission has been found in the main ( 1.665 and 1.667  ghz ) hyperfine structure lines and in the 1.720  ghz satellite line , whereas the 1.612  ghz oh satellite has been observed in absorption @xcite .",
    "weak  and strong  maser emission have been reported at 6.7  ghz @xcite and 22.2  ghz @xcite , respectively .",

    "the mass ( 100  @xmath14 ) from the 3  mm dust continuum emission and the rotational temperature ( 93  k ) inferred from the ch@xmath15cn lines suggest that one is dealing with a hot molecular core ( hmc ) . in this study",

    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the hmc is seen in nh@xmath15 , hco@xmath16 , and ch@xmath15cn line emission .",
    "the observations of @xcite were not sensitive enough to detect continuum emission at 1.3  cm , whereas our new images demonstrate the existence of a free - free continuum source inside the hmc ( see below ) . a wide - angle , massive ( @xmath3100  @xmath14 )",
    "bipolar outflow has been detected in the @xmath17co(10 ) line , oriented perpendicular to a ch@xmath15cn velocity gradient detected in the hmc @xcite .",
    "the absolute positions of the 1.665  ghz oh and 22.2  ghz  masers , derived by @xcite using the vla with an accuracy of 05 , indicate that these maser emissions are associated with the hmc .",

    "the data were calibrated with the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package using standard procedures . only for the a - array data at 1.3  cm ,",
    "several cycles of self - calibration were applied to the strongest maser channel , and the resulting phase and amplitude corrections were eventually transferred to all the other line channels and to the k - band continuum data @xcite .",
    "this procedure resulted in a significant ( at least a factor 2 ) improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "natural - weighted maps were made with task imagr of aips for both the continuum and the line data .",

    "the absolute position of the a - array 1.3  cm image has been obtained by aligning positions of persistent water maser spots between the vla and vlba observations , and should be accurate to @xmath40 .    figure  [ g28-hmc - sed - cm ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at centimeter wavelengths of `` hmc '' .",
    "a spectral index ( @xmath13 ) of 0.6 is derived from a linear fit of the vla c - array 1.3  and  3.6  cm and b - array 6  cm flux densities .",
    "the latter flux is an upper limit obtained from the gps 6  cm epoch  2 images downloadable from the magpis web site , which result to be the most sensitive among the other gps maps and the relevant map from the cornish survey   ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also fit the sed at centimeter wavelengths with a model of a homogeneous region , with a lyman continuum rate of @xmath41  s@xmath22 and a radius of 004 .",
    "we caution that the shape of the sed could be significantly affected by the different sensitivity to extended structures at different wavelengths . for the same vla configuration",
    ", the shorter the wavelength , the larger can be the fraction of emission resolved out by the interferometer .",

    "the general pattern of water maser relative velocities appears to indicate expansion from a point on the sky close to the `` center of motion '' .",

    "the latter was chosen in such a way to include the whole emitting region at all wavelengths . in this way",
    "we overcome the problem of different angular resolutions at different wavelengths . in the calculation of the flux",

    "we have fitted the sed with the radiative transfer model developed by @xcite and @xcite ( using the sed fitting tool available on http://caravan.astro.wisc.edu/protostars/ ) , which assumes a zams star with a circumstellar disk , embedded in an infalling envelope , and allows derivation of a number of physical parameters .",
    "while we are aware that this model can not adequately reproduce a complex situation such as that of the multiple mysos in , we believe that the fit is sufficiently good to guarantee good estimates of _ integrated _ quantities such as the luminosity and the mass of the envelope .",
    "the best - fit values are , respectively , 2.3@xmath110@xmath2 , and 3.0@xmath110@xmath60 . note that in the fitting procedure , the iras fluxes were considered upper limits due to the limited angular resolution , whereas the mipsgal 24  flux is in fact a lower limit because the corresponding image is saturated and only the non saturated pixels have been considered in the calculation .",
    "also , the distance was kept fixed to the nominal value of 7.4  kpc .",
    "the best - fit value for the visual foreground extinction is 46  mag .",
    "in this section , we focus on the cm - continuum source labeled `` hmc '' in table  [ tbl : vla - cm ] , found in good correspondence with the positions of the 22  ghz , 6.7  ghz , and 1.665  ghz oh masers in  ( see figure  [ g28-absp - l ] ) .",
    "the continuum spectrum ( shown in figure  [ g28-hmc - sed - cm ] ) is consistent with free - free emission from an ultracompact  ( uc )  region , with the turnover frequency in the range 1020  ghz , and ionized by a lyman continuum rate of 7.9@xmath110@xmath61  s@xmath22 .",
    "this would correspond to a zams star of spectral type b1b0.5 @xcite , with a luminosity of  @xmath62  @xmath63 , and a mass of  @xmath64 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these values would be different if more recent studies than the seminal article by panagia were adopted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the basic result that one is dealing with an early b - type star with a luminosity of @xmath65 would remain valid .",
    "we note that the fit to the continuum spectrum requires a very small size of the uc   region , of @xmath0004 or @xmath0300  au , which appears in contradiction with the fact that our a - array 1.3  cm observations partly resolve the continuum emission ( see table  [ tbl : vla - cm ] ) .",
    "since we considered a homogeneous distribution of ionized gas in our fit , one possibility is that the region is not homogeneous .",
    "the southern spur identified in the a - array 3.6  cm map of the `` hmc '' source ( see figure  [ g28-absp - l ] ) , could indeed suggest the existence of a density gradient toward the south .",
    "one may speculate that being source `` a '' more extended and perhaps more evolved , the gas in its surroundings is less dense . in this scenario , the north - south streamlines of water masers on either sides of the southern spur , might trace shocks at the interface between the ionized gas of `` hmc '' ( expanding to the south ) and the surrounding molecular gas .",
    "we also note that the continuum spectrum of `` hmc '' between 1.3 and 6  cm can be also fitted with a power law @xmath66 , with @xmath67 ( see figure  [ g28-hmc - sed - cm ] ) .",
    "this spectral index is typical of thermal jets @xcite and provides us with an alternative explanation for the origin of the free - free emission .",
    "however , a caveat is in order . as discussed in section  [ cm_res ] , the slope of the spectrum between 3.6  cm and 1.3  cm could be significantly affected by the inteferometer resolving out part of the emission at the shorter wavelength .",
    "if the spectrum is steeper than estimated from our data , the slope could be still consistent with a thermal jet , but also with that of an region with a density gradient ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that it is impossible to decide the nature of the free - free emission on the basis of the information collected so far . notwithstanding this caveat , as a working hypothesis we prefer the jet interpretation , because this permits to interpret the continuum and maser emission in the same context , as discussed in the following section .",
    "in this section we propose that both the continuum and the water maser emission are associated with a thermal jet impinging against the surrounding quiescent molecular gas .",
    "this idea is based on two observational findings .",
    "first of all , figure  [ g28-rel - pro - s ] shows that , at larger distances from the center of the water maser distribution , maser ( relative ) velocities appear to be larger and better collimated along the northeast - southwest direction .",
    "secondly , the axis of the powerful , molecular outflow mapped at arcsecond scales toward  has a northeast - southwest orientation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  5 ) .",
    "this it is plausible to assume that the two , fast moving , water maser clusters `` j@xmath45 '' and `` j@xmath46 '' , located , respectively , at the northeast and southwest edge of the maser distribution , are excited by the same jet responsible also for driving the large - scale molecular outflow .",
    "one could object against the  jet \" interpretation , that the whole pattern of water maser velocities can not be explained only in terms of a collimated outflow .",
    "in fact , at smaller distances from the center of the maser distribution , water maser velocities point to the north or south directions , and form large angles with the direction of the putative jet .",
    "we propose that the scattered pattern of proper motions presented by the red - shifted water masers can result from the interaction of the jet with dense circumstellar material , which deflects and increase the opening angle of the flow velocities .",
    "if the free - free continuum source `` hmc '' is a jet , the position of the ( proto)star powering it may be offset from the free - free continuum peak .",
    "if a jet powered by the ( proto)star drives the water maser motions , and , in particular , the expansion to the south and west of the narrow strip of red - shifted water masers , the ( proto)star could be located at an intermediate position between `` hmc '' and the red - shifted maser strip .",
    "this point is not far ( within tens of mas ) from the position of the center of motion of the water masers ( cross in figure  [ g28-rel - pro - s ] ) . considering the large uncertainties in deriving the center of water maser expansion , in the following discussion we can safely take the center of motion as a reasonable estimate of the ( proto)star location .    in the jet scenario , one can estimate the momentum rate of the jet from the average distance of the h@xmath44o masers from the myso and the average maser velocity . assuming a h@xmath68 pre - shock density of 10@xmath69  @xmath70 , as predicted by models @xcite , the momentum rate in the water maser jet is given by the expression @xmath71",

    "this expression has been obtained by multiplying the momentum rate per unit surface transferred to the ambient gas ( @xmath76 ) , by @xmath77 , under the assumption that the jet is emitted from a source at a distance @xmath78 from the masers within a beaming angle @xmath75 . to estimate the average distance and velocity of the water masers tracing the jet in",

    "@xmath72  yr@xmath22  km  s@xmath22 .",

    "we find @xmath86  sterad , i.e. a jet semi - opening angle  @xmath87 .",

    "the positions of the methanol maser features roughly along the jet axis , and the similarities in the spectral shape of the water and methanol maser emissions , make us speculate that also the 6.7  ghz methanol masers could originate in the ( proto)stellar jet , albeit associated with more quiescent gas than that traced by the water masers .",
    "maser vlbi observations toward the sources iras20126@xmath44104 and  @xcite have also indicated that the 6.7  ghz masers might trace entrained gas at the interface with a jet .    figure",
    "[ g28-absp - l ] clearly shows that the blue - shifted lobe of the water maser jet is sampled much more sparsely , as it presents much less features than the red - shifted lobe .",
    "this is consistent with the blue - shifted line being significantly weaker than the red - shifted one in the total power spectrum ( see figure  [ g28-maser - spe ] , upper panel ) .",
    "this fact suggests that the circumstellar material is not isotropically distributed around the ( proto)star , but it is mostly concentrated on the side of the red - shifted lobe .",
    "that would also account for the stronger emission line in the total - power spectrum of the  masers at the red - shifted velocities .",
    "the spectrum of the 1.665  ghz maser is dominated by three narrow lcp features ( see figure  [ g28-maser - spe ] , lower panel ) , and is very similar to the spectrum of the 1.667  ghz maser transition observed by @xcite .",
    "these authors find that most oh interstellar masers are highly polarized , either rcp or lcp , with the same predominant polarization for both the 1.665  ghz and 1.667  ghz transition .",
    "they propose an explanation based on large - scale velocity and/or magnetic field gradients across the masing region .",
    "figure  [ g28-vla - cm ] shows that the 1.665  ghz oh maser features are found significantly offset ( @xmath54 ) from the compact vla source `` hmc '' and the center of water maser activity , and are closer to the more extended source `` a '' .",
    "a possible interpretation is that oh masers trace more external , less dense parts of the molecular core surrounding the ( proto)star responsible for the excitation of the water and methanol masers .",
    "observations indicate that the density of massive proto - stellar cores decreases from the center outward , with a power - law index of about 1.6 ( @xmath91 ) @xcite . in ,",
    "the ratio of the average distance ( from the `` center of motion '' of water masers ) of the water ( @xmath92 ) and oh ( @xmath54 ) masers , is about 6 , implying a decrease in gas density by a factor of about 20",

    "so far , we have explored the properties of source `` hmc '' making use of the maser , radio , and ir continuum emission .",
    "now , we want to use our findings to shed light on the nature of the myso(s ) associated with this source .",
    "we have seen that the radio continuum emission and the water maser features suggest the presence of a jet with a large momentum rate , on the order of @xmath95  km  s@xmath22  yr@xmath22 .",
    "values that high are consistent with the jet being powered by a high - mass ( proto)stars , as indicated , e.g. , by the relationship between outflow momentum rate and myso luminosity obtained by @xcite . in particular , from their figure  4b , one can conclude that the myso must have a luminosity of at least several @xmath96 .",
    "alternatively , if the radio emission were originating from an region , we have seen ( section  [ dis_1 ] ) that the ionizing star should have a luminosity @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , both the thermal jet and the region hypotheses imply similar luminosity for the associated myso .",
    "the question we want to investigate here is whether such a luminosity is consistent with the results obtained from the ir data .    in section",
    "[ sed ] we have found that the total luminosity of the region is on the order of @xmath98 .",
    "however , this includes all mysos in a radius @xmath9910  around `` hmc '' , whereas we need to estimate the contribution of the sole `` hmc '' , to achieve a consistent comparison with the luminosity estimate obtained from the water maser and/or radio continuum .",
    "our 24.5  continuum image can be used for this purpose .",
    "as shown in figure  [ g28-q - cm ] , the `` hmc '' source is dominating the emission at this wavelength , contributing to @xmath090% of the total flux density , and a similar conclusion holds also for the glimpse images . due to the lack of sub - arcsecond imaging at longer wavelengths , it is difficult to establish whether also the flux density measured close to the peak of the sed is mostly due to source `` hmc '' . nonetheless , the hi - gal / herschel data suggest that the 70  @xmath56 m emission peaks closer to source `` hmc '' than source `` a '' .",
    "a word of caution is in order here .",
    "the angular resolution of the hi - gal data at 70  is estimated to be about @xmath100 ( after reduction with the roma - gal software ) , while the astrometrical error is @xmath035 ( the latter results from aligning the pacs 70  @xmath56 m images to the mipsgal 24  @xmath56 m images by matching suitable point sources detected at both wavelengths ) .",
    "although large , these values still permit to associate the 70  emission with source `` hmc '' .",
    "in fact , the angular separation between the 3.6  cm continuum source `` hmc '' and the 70  @xmath56 m peak is 37 , consistent with the positional error , whereas source `` a '' lies 65 from the 70  @xmath56 m peak .",
    "this can be appreciated in figure  [ fcm70 ] , where one sees that the 70  @xmath56 m emission peaks to the nw of `` hmc '' .",
    "therefore , in the following we assume that the bolometric luminosity estimated from the sed is likely dominated by the `` hmc '' source and conclude that the myso(s ) embedded in the hmc may be as luminous as @xmath101 .    notwithstanding",
    "the large uncertainties of all our luminosity estimates , the value obtained from the ir images exceeds by an order of magnitude that derived from the maser and radio continuum data .",
    "this inconsistency can be explained if `` hmc '' is hosting a multiple stellar system rather than a single star .",
    "one can get an idea of how this may affect our estimate of the stellar properties ( mass , etc . ) by assuming that the luminosity of @xmath98 is emitted by a stellar cluster with a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "one finds that the luminosity of the most massive star may be as small as @xmath102 , depending on the statistical distribution of the stellar masses in the cluster .",
    "given the uncertainties , this value is only marginally greater than the luminosity estimate from the radio continuum and maser data .",
    "the same method provides us with the total mass of the stellar cluster , which ranges from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , depending on the statistical distribution of the stars in the cluster .",
    "this stellar mass can be divided by the total mass of the associated molecular clump , @xmath105 ( see section  [ sed ] ) , to calculate the star formation efficiency , 17%67% .",
    "albeit large , values like these are not implausible , as we are considering the part of the molecular cloud where star formation concentrates @xcite .    in conclusion , we believe that the observational evidence collected so far for source `` hmc '' suggests that one is observing a young star of 2030  @xmath106 , still in the main accretion phase and surrounded by a rich stellar cluster .",
    "such a conclusion holds independently of the scenario adopted to explain the free - free emission ( thermal jet or weak region ) and raises a question : why only faint free - free emission is detected from this object ?",
    "a @xmath102 star is expected to ionize the surrounding gas emitting a flux density of @xmath02  mjy ( in the optically thin limit ) , whereas towards source `` hmc '' less than 1  mjy is measured .",
    "a possible explanation is that the region is at least partly quenched by accretion from the parental core , as depicted , e.g. , in the model by @xcite .",
    "although no evidence of accretion is seen in a typical infall tracer such as hco@xmath107 @xcite , this fact is inconclusive because the majority of the detected hco@xmath16(10 ) might be part of the outflowing gas , thus hindering the detection of infall .",
    "finally , it is also worth mentioning that according to recent theoretical models @xcite , large accretion rates are bound to bloat the protostellar radius and decrease the corresponding temperature and lyman continuum flux .",
    "this could be an alternative explanation of the lack of a ( strong ) region .",
    "we observed the hmsfr  with the vlbi phase - referencing technique in three powerful maser transitions : 22.2  ghz , 6.7  ghz , and 1.665  ghz oh . in addition , we also performed vla observations of the radio continuum emission at 1.3  and  3.6  cm with both the a-  and  c - array , and subaru / comics observations of the mid - infrared continuum emission .",
    "we also made use of data from the hi - gal / herschel , atlasgal / apex , as well as other surveys of the galactic plane .",
    "from all these observations , we draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the bipolar distribution of l.o.s . velocities and the general pattern of observed relative proper motions indicate that the water masers are tracing expansion with an average velocity of @xmath024  from a point on the sky close to the maser `` center of motion '' . while at larger distance from the `` center of motion '' , maser velocities are higher and better collimated along the northeast - southwest direction , at closer distances water masers show smaller speeds and a larger scatter in the velocity orientations .",
    "we interpret these facts as the result of the interaction of a ( proto)stellar jet with dense circumstellar material .",
    "two continuum sources ( named `` hmc '' and `` a '' ) , separated by @xmath031 along the north - south direction , are observed with the vla at 3.6  and  1.3  cm . the `` hmc '' source is compact and spatially associated with the observed ,  and oh masers . whether the free - free emission arising from this source is due to an region or a thermal ionized jet",
    "can not be unambiguously established with the present data .",
    "however , we believe that the jet hypothesis is more consistent with the direction of the water maser motions , which outline expansion in a bipolar flow . moreover , the orientation and momentum rate of the putative jet are compatible with those of the molecular outflow detected at arcsecond scales .",
    "we hence argue that the jet traced by the water masers is also powering the large - scale outflow .",
    "the combined information obtained from sub - arcsecond imaging with subaru / comics at 24.5  and lower angular resolution images from the hi - gal / herschel and atlasgal / apex surveys , permit to estimate with good accuracy the luminosity ( @xmath98 ) and gas mass ( @xmath105 ) of the star forming region of , and establish that @xmath090% of the luminosity is coming from the radio source `` hmc '' .",
    "we conclude that this source must contain multiple stars , with the most massive being at least as luminous as @xmath108 .",
    "the lack of an associated hii region indicates that the 2030  @xmath106 star must be still undergoing heavy accretion from the surrounding envelope .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for careful reading of the text and the constructive criticisms that improved the presentation and analysis of our results .",

    "<S> we used the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the european vlbi network ( evn ) to perform phase - referenced vlbi observations of the three most powerful maser transitions associated with the high - mass star - forming region : the 22.2  ghz , 6.7  ghz , and 1.665  ghz oh lines . </S>",
    "<S> we also performed vla observations of the radio continuum emission at 1.3  and  3.6  cm and subaru observations of the continuum emission at 24.5  . </S>",
    "<S> two centimeter continuum sources are detected and one of them ( named `` hmc '' ) is compact and placed at the center of the observed distribution of ,  and oh masers . </S>",
    "<S> the bipolar distribution of line - of - sight ( l.o.s ) velocities and the pattern of the proper motions suggest that the water masers are driven by a ( proto)stellar jet interacting with the dense circumstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> the same jet could both excite the centimeter continuum source named `` hmc '' ( interpreted as free - free emission from shocked gas ) and power the molecular outflow observed at larger scales  although one can not exclude that the free - free continuum is rather originating from a hypercompact region . at 24.5  , we identify two objects separated along the north - south direction , whose absolute positions agree with those of the two vla continuum sources . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that @xmath090% of the luminosity of the region ( @xmath02@xmath110@xmath2 ) is coming from the radio source `` hmc '' , which confirms the existence of an embedded massive young stellar object ( myso ) exciting the masers and possibly still undergoing heavy accretion from the surrounding envelope . </S>"
