    "the fock vacuum state with respect to a uniformly accelerating observer , behaves as a _",
    "thermal _ state of a given temperature which is proportional to the magnitude , say @xmath0 , of the acceleration 4-vector .",
    "this phenomena is referred as unruh effect @xcite .",
    "the corresponding temperature is called _ unruh temperature _ given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the _ boltzmann constant_. this result follows from the application of standard quantum field theory techniques in a curved background @xcite .",
    "the existence of unruh effect can be seen using many different methods .",
    "firstly , one can use the method of _ bogoliubov transformations_. there one computes expectation value of number density operator for the accelerated observer in the fock vacuum state .",
    "the corresponding expression turns out to be a blackbody distribution at unruh temperature . in this method",
    "it appears explicitly that unruh effect depends on the contributions from trans - planckian modes as observed by an _",
    "inertial _ observer .",
    "this aspect makes the unruh effect to be a potentially interesting phenomena to explore and understand the implications of possible planck - scale physics @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the unruh effect provides a probing window for many candidate theories of quantum gravity .",
    "usually these theories predict large modifications for the trans - planckian modes .",
    "while this approach is conceptually simpler but in order to arrive at the result one is required to use rather sophisticated regularization techniques to handle field theoretical divergences .",
    "therefore , one is led to pursue other methods of derivation to ensure that the result is not an artifact of the employed regularization tools .",
    "an alternative method which is often employed to verify the existence of unruh effect , is to compute the response function of the so - called unruh - dewitt detector that moves along the trajectory of the accelerated observer @xcite .",
    "this method essentially relies on the concepts of einstein @xmath3 and @xmath4 coefficients that are used to describe the _ spontaneous _ and _ induced _ emission or absorption in statistical physics . in particular , one considers a two - level quantum mechanical system as a detector which weakly couples to the surrounding matter field .",
    "the transition probability between the energy levels which is referred as the _ response function _ of the detector , is then used to conclude about the nature of the surrounding environment .",
    "it turns out that the response function depends on the properties of two - point function of the matter field .",
    "given that the unruh effect receives explicit contributions from trans - planckian modes in the method of bogoliubov transformations , it is compelling to check whether these contributions can also affect the corresponding response function . in this article , we compute the response function of a unruh - dewitt detector in the context of the so called polymer quantization of scalar matter field which couples weakly to the detector .",
    "polymer quantization or loop quantization @xcite is used as a quantization method in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is known to differ from the schrdinger quantization method in multiple ways when applied to a mechanical system .",
    "firstly , it comes with a new dimension - full parameter other than _ planck constant _ @xmath5 . in the context of full quantum gravity , this new scale essentially corresponds to _ planck length _ @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , in the kinematical hilbert space which is non - separable , one can not define both position and momentum operators simultaneously but only one of them . due to the non - separability of kinematical hilbert space",
    ", the stone - von neumann uniqueness theorem is also not applicable .",
    "these aspects make polymer quantization unitarily _ inequivalent _ to schrdinger quantization @xcite , allowing a different set of results , in principle , from polymer quantization .    in the section [ sec : rindlerobserver ]",
    ", we briefly study the trajectory of a uniformly accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime and the properties of rindler metric as seen by the accelerated observer . in the section [ sec : einsteinabcoefficients ] , we review the basic ideas behind einstein @xmath3 and @xmath4 coefficients . in the section [ sec : masslessscalarfield ] , we consider a massless scalar field in the canonical approach which is convenient for application of polymer quantization .",
    "we study the properties of the unruh - dewitt detector in the section [ sec : unruh - dewitt - detector ] .",
    "subsequently , we study the short and long distance behaviour of the two - point function in fock and polymer quantization .",
    "then we compute the corresponding response functions . in fock quantization , induced transition rate of the detector contains both transient and non - transient terms .",
    "in particular , non - transient term is proportional to planck distribution and it contains a residue computed at the pole of the corresponding two - point function . on the other hand , we show that the two - point function has no pole in polymer quantization .",
    "consequently , the corresponding residue which is non - zero in fock quantization vanishes in polymer quantization .",
    "so the transition rate in polymer quantization contains only transient terms .",
    "the result as shown here , provides an alternative evidence to the earlier reported results where it is shown using method of bogoliubov transformation @xcite as well as using kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition @xcite that unruh effect is absent in polymer quantization .",
    "with respect to a uniformly accelerated observer , a section of minkowski spacetime can be described by the so - called rindler metric . in _ conformal _ rindler coordinates @xmath7 ,",
    "the rindler metric can be expressed as @xcite @xmath8 where we have used the _",
    "natural _ units ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is the magnitude of _ acceleration _ 4-vector .",
    "minkowski metric with respect to an _ inertial _ observer with cartesian coordinates @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",

    "i.e. _ the uniformly accelerated observer , is related with the coordinates of the inertial observer as @xmath12 where we have assumed that rindler observer moves along @xmath13 x - axis with respect to the inertial observer",
    ". therefore , @xmath14 and @xmath15 coordinates are the same for both observers .",
    "it follows from the equation ( [ rindlerminkowskirelation ] ) that only a wedge - shaped section of minkowski spacetime is covered by rindler spacetime .",
    "the wedge - shaped section is often referred as _ rindler wedge_.",
    "the working principle behind unruh - dewitt detector can be understood in terms of the so - called _ einstein a and b coefficients _ of statistical physics .",
    "let us consider a two - level atomic system of energy @xmath16 and @xmath17 which is in contact with a _ heat bath _ of spectral energy density @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "the probability of transition from the _ level @xmath20 _ to the _ level @xmath21 _ _ per unit time _ , _ per unit atom _ is postulated to be @xmath22 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the einstein coefficients . the coefficient @xmath3 represents the transition rate for the _ spontaneous _ emission whereas the coefficient @xmath4 represents the same for the _ induced _ emission . on the other hand ,",
    "transition probability _ per unit time _ , _ per unit atom _ from the _ level @xmath21 _ to the _ level @xmath20 _ is postulated to contain only the _ induced _ term as @xmath23 if the system is in equilibrium with the heat bath and number of particles in the energy _",
    "levels @xmath21 , @xmath20 _ are @xmath24 , @xmath25 respectively , then the detailed balance relation implies @xmath26 on the other hand , particles numbers would satisfy boltzmann distribution law _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 .",
    "so if the ratio of the einstein coefficients is taken to be @xmath28 , then it precisely leads to planck distribution formula for spectral energy density of blackbody radiation @xmath29 clearly , the induced transition rate of the two - level system in equilibrium can be used to conclude about the thermal nature of the surrounding environment .",
    "in particular , the equation ( [ twoleveltransition12 ] ) implies that if the induced transition rate from the _ level @xmath21 _ to the _ level @xmath20 _ is proportional to planck formula for _ mean energy _",
    "@xmath30 of a given mode with angular frequency @xmath31 _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath32 then surrounding environment must be a thermal radiation at a temperature @xmath33 .",
    "we note that only the ratio of the einstein coefficients is relevant here but not their absolute values .",
    "in order to study the response function of the unruh - dewitt detector , we consider here a massless scalar field @xmath34 in minkowski spacetime that weakly couples to the detector .",
    "the corresponding scalar field dynamics is described by the action @xmath35 ~.\\ ] ] in the canonical formulation , the dynamics of the scalar field can be equivalently described by the field hamiltonian @xmath36 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the metric on _ spatial _ hyper - surfaces labeled by @xmath38 .",
    "poisson bracket between the field @xmath39 and its conjugate field momentum @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dirac delta .",

    "the space being non - compact , the spatial volume would normally diverge for minkowski spacetime .",
    "therefore , it is often convenient to use a fiducial box of finite volume so that one can avoid dealing with such divergent quantity .",
    "kronecker delta and dirac delta then can be expressed as @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the field hamiltonian ( [ sfhamgen ] ) can be expressed as @xmath47 , where hamiltonian density for the @xmath48th fourier mode is @xmath49 poisson brackets between these fourier modes and their conjugate momenta are given by @xmath50 in order to satisfy the _ reality condition _ of the scalar field @xmath51 , one usually redefines the _ complex - valued _",

    "we may express the energy spectrum of these fourier modes as @xmath57 . using the vacuum state of each mode @xmath58",
    ", we can express the vacuum state of the scalar field as @xmath59 .",
    "unruh - dewitt detector is considered to be a point - like quantum mechanical system having two internal energy levels .",
    "these system of detectors interact _ weakly _ with the scalar field through a _ linear _ coupling which is treated as perturbative interaction to the detectors .",
    "if we denote the hamiltonian operator of an _ unperturbed _ detector by @xmath60 then we may express the energy eigenvalue equation of the detector as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the _ ground state _ and the _ excited state _ respectively .",
    "we may denote the energy gap between the levels as @xmath64 the interaction term in the hamiltonian of unruh - dewitt detector is taken to be of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the _ coupling constant _ and @xmath67 is the monopole moment operator of the detector .",
    "the world line @xmath68 of the detector is parametrized using the proper time @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian of the detector becomes @xmath70 given the nature of the hamiltonian , it is convenient to work in the so - called ` interaction picture ' of quantum mechanics . in particular , by defining interaction state @xmath71 in terms of schrdinger state @xmath72 as @xmath73 one can express the time evolution of the detector state as @xmath74 where the evolution operator is given by @xmath75 we may denote the combined state of the detector and the scalar field at a given proper time @xmath69 as @xmath76 to the @xmath77 can be written as @xmath78 we are interested here in considering the induced transition of the detector which is initially at the ground state @xmath62 and the scalar field is in its vacuum state _ i.e. _ @xmath79 .",
    "then transition probability of the detector being at the excited state @xmath63 at a later time @xmath69 for all possible field state is @xmath80 it is now straightforward to express the transition probability ( [ transitionprobabilitydetector ] ) in the form of @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 depends on the internal structure of the detector system .",

    "we shall use this freedom to scale the response function of the detector such that proportionality constant between the induced transition rate and the mean energy per mode , as in equation ( [ twoleveltransition12numberdensity ] ) , becomes identity . using equation ( [ transitionprobabilitydetector2 ] )",
    "we define the _ instantaneous _ transition rate , after being scaled by the chosen factor , as @xmath88 which can be further expressed as @xmath89 here @xmath90 represents time independent _ i.e. _ _ non - transient _ part of the induced transition rate and its expression is given by @xmath91 on the other hand @xmath92 represent time - dependent _ i.e. _ _ transient _ part of the induced transition rate and its expression is @xmath93 ~.\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath94 as the time of observation increases _ i.e. _ @xmath95 .",
    "we should emphasize here that the definition of instantaneous transition rate ( [ detectortransitionrate ] ) presumes the so - called _ sharp switching _ of the unruh - dewitt detector .",
    "while sharp switching of the detector is used quite widely in the literature , it has certain key weaknesses .",
    "this issue has been studied in @xcite and it is shown that one could overcome these weaknesses by considering either a spatially extended detector or a smooth switching function without affecting the main result regarding unruh effect .",
    "it is evident from the equation ( [ detectortransitionrate ] ) that induced transition rate of the unruh - dewitt detector is fully determined once the properties of the two - point function is known . in terms of the fourier modes ( [ fouriermodesdef ] ) ,",

    "as one of the consequences , it is shown in @xcite that polymer vacuum state is not strictly invariant under the _ boost_. therefore , the specific nature of the transient terms as studied here are effectively tied to the observer in polymer quantization .",

    "therefore , the _ short - distance _ singular nature of the fock space two - point function is a key input to ensure the non - vanishing residue which in turns plays the crucial role for the existence of unruh effect . on the other hand",
    ", it is widely expected that the short distance behaviour of the two - point function would receive significant modifications from possible planck - scale physics . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that this expectation is indeed borne out in polymer quantization where the short - distance two - point function receives _ non - perturbative _ modifications .",
    "in particular , the short - distance singular two - point function is replaced by a regular function which has no divergence in short - distance .",
    "finally , we may recall that several experiments have been proposed to detect possible signatures of unruh effect in laboratory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the result as shown here using response function of an unruh - dewitt detector and also shown earlier using methods of bogoliubov transformation @xcite and kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition @xcite where criticism raised in @xcite was also addressed , clearly indicates that the experimental detection of unruh effect can be used as a probe of possible planck - scale physics .",
    "in particular , such a detection can be used to either verify or rule out a candidate planck scale theory with a new dimension - full parameter , which affects quantization of matter fields as considered here .",
    "we conclude by acknowledging few similar recent results in the context of polymer quantization where it is shown that some high energy modifications can indeed lead to the alteration of certain low energy phenomena @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is shown in @xcite that polymer vacuum state is not strictly invariant under the _ boost_. therefore , the specific nature of the transient terms as studied here are effectively tied to the observer in polymer quantization . however , the transient terms are shown to decay out exponentially .",
    "so the detector response after a reasonably long time , in the scale of @xmath225 , becomes essentially time independent .",
    "clearly , the existence of unruh effect needs to be understood from the properties of the non - transient part of the detector response as studied here .",
    "we would like to thank ritesh singh for discussions .",
    "we thank subhajit barman and chiranjeeb singha for their comments on the manuscript .",
    "gs would like to thank ugc for supporting this work through a doctoral fellowship ."

    "<S> if an unruh - dewitt detector operates for an infinite proper time along the trajectory of a uniformly accelerated observer in fock space then induced transition rate of the detector is proportional to planck distribution . for a realistic detector which operates only for a finite period , the instantaneous transition rate contains both transient and non - transient terms . in particular , the non - transient term contains a _ residue _ evaluated at the pole of the two - point function . </S>",
    "<S> we show here by considering a massless scalar field that unlike in fock quantization , the short - distance two - point function contains no pole in polymer quantization , the quantization techniques used in loop quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , corresponding transition rate of the unruh - dewitt detector contains only transient terms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the result presented here provides an alternative evidence for absence of unruh effect in polymer quantization which was shown earlier by the authors using methods of bogoliubov transformation and kubo - martin - schwinger condition . </S>"
