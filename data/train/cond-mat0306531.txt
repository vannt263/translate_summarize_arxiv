    "in the last years , the continuous increase of traffic demand has prompted authorities around the world to place more emphasis on improving the efficiency and capacity on the roadway systems .",
    "ecological considerations , space and budgetary constraints have limited solving traffic congestion by upgrading and constructing new roadway systems .",
    "advanced technologies for vehicular traffic have been developed as a mean to improve the management of existing system and thus to solve traffic congestion , environmental issues and improve traffic safety . however , to achieve these aims , an accurate forecast of the impact of these technologies is critical before their final deployment .",
    "testing these advanced technologies on real traffic is not always feasible .",
    "in contrast , computer simulations as means for evaluating control and management strategies in traffic systems have gained considerable importance because of the possibility of taking into account the dynamical aspects of traffic ( see for example , @xcite ) and assessing the performance of a given advanced technology in a short time .",
    "cellular automata ( ca ) models for traffic flow @xcite have shown the ability to capture the basic phenomena in traffic flow @xcite .",
    "cellular automata are dynamic models in which space , time and state variables are discrete .",
    "discrete space consists of a regular grid of cells , each one of which can be in one of a finite number @xmath2 of possible states .",
    "all cells are updated in discrete time - steps .",
    "the new state of a cell is determined by the actual state of the cell itself and its neighbor cells .",
    "this local interaction allows us to capture micro - level dynamics and propagates them to macro - level behavior .",
    "the discrete nature of ca makes it possible to simulate large realistic traffic networks using a microscopic model faster than real time @xcite .",
    "now , almost eleven years after the introduction of the first ca models , several theoretical studies and practical applications have improved the understanding of empirical traffic phenomena ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , ca models have proved to be a realistic description of vehicular traffic in dense networks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a single - lane probabilistic model based on the first ca model of nagel and schreckenberg @xcite ( hereafter cited as the nasch model ) to describe the effects of several anticipation schemes in traffic flow .",
    "anticipation in traffic means that drivers estimate their leader s velocities for future time - steps @xcite .",
    "this can lead to an increase of the vehicular capacity and a decrease of the speed variance .",
    "however , incorporating different driving strategies requires a safety distance with respect to the preceding vehicles . for that purpose",
    "we introduce a new parameter in the deceleration process , called _ anticipatory driving parameter _ , to estimate the velocity of the precedent vehicle .",
    "this estimation , plus the real spatial distance to the leading vehicle , determine a safe braking distance . by appropriately tuning this new parameter different traffic situations of non - automated , automated and mixed traffic",
    "can be considered .",
    "furthermore , the anticipatory driving parameter is relevant for automated highway systems ( ahs ) @xcite .    according to simulation results from our proposed model , the relations derived from the density vs. velocity and density vs.  flow curves are in agreement with the fundamental diagrams that describe these relations in real non - automated traffic .",
    "in addition , simulation results from our model in the case of high anticipation ( like automation ) describe one of the interesting phenomena in traffic flow , _ formation of platoons_. we will show that , in contrast to models without anticipation , _ dense _ platoons can be formed where all cars move coherently with some finite velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the mechanism for platoon formation is not only of great importance for ahs to increase highway capacity in a much safer way @xcite , but also helps to understand the essential role of anticipation effects in realistic traffic models . by varying the anticipatory driving parameter three different regimes , characterized by different slopes of the fundamental diagrams ,",
    "can be observed .",
    "apart from a free - flow and a congested phase , an additional regime where platoons of cars moving with the same velocity @xmath4 exist .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ modeldef ]",
    "we define a modified nasch model to consider different driving strategies . in this way",
    ", we introduce a new parameter to determine a velocity - dependent braking distance . in section  [ simuresults ] , we present the results of our investigations .",
    "we show results for the fundamental diagram and different values of the anticipation parameter . a comparison with those for other models and real non - automated traffic is presented .",
    "phase separation into a free - flow regime and so - called @xmath0-platoon is observed in a certain intermediate density regime . for large densities , in the congested state phase separation into a dense jam ( @xmath1-platoon ) and @xmath0-platoons is observed .",
    "the flow structure determined by the existence of dense platoons with velocity @xmath0 is calculated .",
    "dependence of an optimal anticipation level on the density is found .",
    "analytical results are in excellent agreement with results from computer simulations . in the concluding section  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the relevance of our results for traffic models and real traffic .",
    "in this section we introduce the proposed model . it is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath5 cells with periodic boundary conditions , which corresponds to a ring topology with the number of vehicles preserved .",
    "each cell is either empty , or it is occupied by just one vehicle traveling with a discrete velocity @xmath0 at a given instant of time . all vehicles have a velocity that ranges from @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , and for simplicity , only one type of vehicles is considered .",
    "the time - step ( @xmath7 ) is taken to be one second , therefore transitions are from @xmath8 .",
    "it can also be easily modified .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the current velocity and position , respectively , of the vehicle @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the velocity and position , respectively , of the vehicle ahead ( preceding vehicle ) at a fixed time ; @xmath14 denotes the distance ( number of empty cells ) in front of the vehicle in position @xmath10 that sometimes is called headway .",
    "the dynamics of the model are defined by the following set of rules , that are applied to all @xmath15 vehicles on the lattice each time - step :    r1 : : :    acceleration +    if @xmath16 , the velocity of the car    @xmath11 is increased by one , i.e. ,    @xmath17 r2 : : :    randomization +    if @xmath18 , the velocity of car @xmath11  is    decreased randomly by one unit with probability @xmath19 , i.e. ,    @xmath20 r3 : : :    deceleration +    if @xmath21 , where    @xmath22,\\ ] ]    with a parameter @xmath23 , the velocity of    car @xmath11  is reduced to @xmath24 .",

    "+    the new velocity of the vehicle @xmath11 is therefore    @xmath28 r4 : : :    vehicle movement +    each car is moving forward according to its new velocity determined in    steps 1 - 3 , i.e. , @xmath29    rules @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are designed to update velocity of vehicles ; rule @xmath33 updates position . according to this",
    ", state updating is divided into two stages , first velocity , second position .",
    "note that this division follows the scheme in differential equation integration that first updates the time derivative and then the value of the state .",
    "it is important to mention that we are changing the order of the rules in comparison with nasch model since @xmath31 is applied before @xmath32 .",
    "rule @xmath30 indicates that all the drivers would like to reach the maximum velocity when possible .",
    "rule @xmath31 takes into account the different behavioral patterns of the individual drivers in which with no apparent reason a driver decreases its speed .",
    "these situations include , for example , cases of overreaction in braking or incidents along the highway that distract drivers , and random fluctuations .",
    "rule @xmath32 is the main modification to the original nasch model @xcite . in this rule",
    "the distances between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 vehicles , and their corresponding velocities are considered .",
    "knowledge of the preceding vehicle s velocity is incorporated through the _",
    "anticipatory driving parameter _",
    "@xmath36 with range @xmath23 .",
    "notice that , by only varying the parameter @xmath37 in the term @xmath38 $ ] , different anticipatory driving schemes that require different safe braking distance with respect to the preceding vehicle can be modelled . if @xmath36 takes its maximum value ( @xmath39 ) the speed of the vehicle ahead is not considered in the deceleration process , i.e.anticipation is not considered . on the contrary , when @xmath40 the speed of the vehicle ahead is considered without restrictions , i.e. , without establishing a braking distance with respect to the precedent vehicle @xcite .",
    "this last case occurs with either a very aggressive driver or when vehicles can obtain information about the velocity of vehicles ahead to allow small distances between vehicles ( e.g.  of the order 1  m ) .",
    "intermediate values for @xmath36 thus represent different braking spacing policies or degrees of automation in the vehicles or anticipatory driving schemes .",
    "platooning schemes @xcite imply values of @xmath36 closer to zero and demand additional requirements to preserve safety , like coordinated braking @xcite .",
    "independent vehicle driving with low level of anticipation implies values of @xmath36 closer to 1 in order to preserve safety levels : the larger @xmath37 is the larger braking distance is .",
    "note that in order to determine @xmath41 consistently for all vehicles in the case of periodic boundary conditions , rule @xmath32 must be iterated at most @xmath42 times .",
    "in real situations , the drivers always estimate the velocity of preceding vehicle and according to this and their way to drive ( relaxed or aggressive behavior ) they choose a safe headway distance to drive .",
    "variation of @xmath37 allows also to model these aspects .",
    "thus , the proposed model is able to represent different anticipatory driving schemes , and model the minimum braking distance required with only one parameter @xmath37 , here referred to as _ anticipatory driving parameter_.    we emphasize that the ca model as presented here is a minimal model in the sense that all four steps @xmath30-@xmath33 are necessary to reproduce the basic features of real traffic , however , additional rules may be needed to capture more complex situations @xcite .",
    "to simulate the ca model proposed in the previous section , the typical length of a cell is around @xmath43  m. it is interpreted as the length of a vehicle plus the distance between cars in a dense jam , but it can be suitably adjusted according to the problem under consideration . with this value of the cell size and a time - step of 1 s",
    ", @xmath44 corresponds to moving from one cell to the downstream neighbor cell in one time - step , and translates to @xmath45 km/h in real units .",
    "the maximum velocity is set to @xmath46 , equivalent to @xmath47  km / h .",
    "the total number of cells is assumed to be @xmath48 , and the density @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 , where @xmath15 is the number of cars on the highway .",
    "initially , @xmath15 vehicles are distributed randomly on the lane around the loop with an initial speed taking a discrete random value between 0 and @xmath51 .",
    "since the system is closed , the density remains constant with time .",
    "velocities are updated according to the velocity updating rules @xmath52 and then all of cars are moved forward in step @xmath33 . each run is simulated for @xmath53 time - steps . in order to analyze results , the first half of the simulation is discarded to let transients die out and the system reach its steady state . for each simulation a value for parameter @xmath36 is established by taking into account the desired anticipation degree and thus , controlling the safe braking distance among vehicles . in the following ,",
    "the value of @xmath37 is the same for all vehicles ( homogeneous drivers ) .",
    "the fundamental diagram is one of the most important criteria to show that the model reproduces traffic flow behavior .",
    "this diagram characterizes the dependence of the vehicles flow on density .",
    "we obtain a fundamental diagram for the proposed model with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , see fig .",
    "this @xmath37 value corresponds to cautious estimation of the preceding car s velocity .    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the curve of the proposed model ( dashed line ) is consistent with the characteristic curve of the measured fundamental diagram ( solid line ) taken from @xcite . the critical density and",

    "moreover , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , a decrease in the experimental curve slope is observed at @xmath61 @xmath62  cars / h ) , corresponding to a reduced mean velocity of vehicles near the critical density .",
    "thus , we make a small modification to the proposed model based on an idea of @xcite .",
    "we modified the deceleration rule such that a vehicle can only reach the maximum velocity if its braking distance to the precedent vehicle is greater than nine cells ( @xmath63  m , i.e , the density is lower than @xmath64 ) .",
    "the modified rule @xmath32 of the model is then as follows :    r3 : : :    if @xmath65 ( i.e.  @xmath66 and    @xmath67  cells then    @xmath68    else ( like rule _ r3 _ of our original model )    @xmath69     and @xmath70 ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the results obtained from our modified model are shown and compared with the experimental curve from real traffic data @xcite .",
    "the curve resulting from the modified model fits the real curve in both its increasing part and its decreasing part quite well .",
    "thus , the results from the modified model agree quantitatively with the experimental shape of the fundamental diagram .",
    "this is an indication that in real traffic the value of @xmath37 may depend on velocity .    in this subsection , we have shown that the given model can reproduce some common characteristics of the real manual ( non - automated ) traffic flow .",
    "however , with the new parameter it is possible to consider several anticipation schemes for traffic flow : non - automated , mixed and automated traffic flow . this will be shown in the following for the original model ( _ r3 _ ) defined in sec .",
    "[ modeldef ] .",
    "determination of the impact of different driving strategies is important in order to propose automated traffic alternatives .",
    "following that proposal , we decided to investigate traffic flow behavior using our model .",
    "as mentioned above , the parameter @xmath36 represents the way in which different driving strategies adopt a braking distance with respect to the preceding vehicles . varying the parameter @xmath36 ,",
    "these strategies can be tuned . in fig .",
    "[ f3b ] we show the fundamental diagram of the proposed model with a fixed value of @xmath54 and different values of @xmath36 . from this diagram",
    ", the impact of the driving strategies coded in @xmath36 can be observed .",
    "smaller values of @xmath37 imply larger flows , that is , higher levels of anticipation",
    ". here vehicles keep a less safe braking distance , leading to an increase in the vehicular capacity .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with , for example , platooning strategies that exploit the knowledge of the velocity of precedent vehicles and require a smaller distance among vehicles ( near 1  m ) , so increasing the flow .     and @xmath71 .",
    "]    it is important to notice that for values of @xmath37 from 0.13 to 0.50 a second positive slope corresponding to a mixed branch is observed in the fundamental diagram .",
    "it is interesting that the initial positive slope , corresponding to a free - flow region where there are no slow vehicles , is similar for all values of @xmath37 . here",
    "the vehicles travel at near maximum speed . for the second branch ,",
    "on the other hand , the flow is increased with non - maximum velocity , indicating a mixed region due to anticipation effects ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . in order to analyze the role of the anticipation",
    ", we show the average velocity as function of the density for the same parameter values as in fig .",
    "[ f3b ] .     and different values of @xmath37 .",
    "]    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , higher levels of anticipation ( smaller values of @xmath37 ) imply a larger density interval for the free - flow region . for values @xmath72 , after the free - flow region , traffic flow organizes in a so - called mixed region with a lower mean velocity . in this mixed region , in addition to free flowing vehicles , and vehicles moving in platoons where all cars have the same velocity and vanishing headway exist .",
    "the existence of this mixed region indicates that a suitable estimation of the velocity of precedent vehicle , coded in @xmath37 , allows that more cars to fit on the road and the flow increases ever for values of large - density .    .",
    "after switching to @xmath73 , the behavior changes dramatically . ]",
    "[ f5 ] shows a space - time diagram for @xmath54 , @xmath74 that exemplifies the dramatic changes in the microscopic structure when changing the value of @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation is started with @xmath75 where the jamming regions travel backwards . however , after some time we switch to @xmath73 and immediately observe a dramatic change in the slope of the congested regions .",
    "they are now traveling forward .",
    "this behavior has been observed before in anticipatory modeling @xcite .",
    "such structured flow observed in space - time diagrams increases the highway capacity due to the space reduction among vehicles . in these simulations",
    "we have found that the branches of congested or jammed flow collapse to a single region as in the vdr model @xcite .",
    "these results are analogous to those for slow - to - start models , because effectively the outflow from a jam is reduced compared to the maximal flow .        on the other hand , it is also important to analyze the efficiency of traffic . in non - equilibrium situations ,",
    "this is usually evaluated by analyzing the entropy of the system .",
    "however , for non - physical systems the analysis of the standard deviation of the main variable can give equivalent information @xcite .",
    "in the context of traffic flow , high standard deviation of speed means that , on average , a vehicle would experience frequent speed changes per trip through the system . in turn , the high speed variance could also increase the probability of traffic accidents .",
    "therefore , the standard deviation of speed can be seen as an indicator of the efficiency in traffic flow .    in order to analyze the efficiency of traffic with different automation levels , we calculate the standard deviation of speed ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) . for each value of @xmath37 a maximum that occurs shortly after the free - flow region can be clearly seen .",
    "in the free - flow region , the speed variance is negligible since there are no slow vehicles and fluctuations are extremely rare .",
    "since the free - flow region increases as @xmath37 decreases , it is seems reasonable to attempt traffic with the higher level of anticipation in the range of density from 0 to 0.5 .",
    "this selection not only produces a state with higher flow , but also the lowest standard deviation , so the efficiency is the highest .",
    "it can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ f6 ] that beyond the efficient density range , the level of anticipation coded in @xmath37 should be switched based on the density regime : for @xmath76 $ ] , an efficient performance is found with @xmath77 ; however , for @xmath78 $ ] the highest efficiency is attained with @xmath79 .",
    "summarizing , the behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] indicates that the automation level should be determined depending on the density : higher densities require a lower automation level , that is , a safer braking distance .    besides",
    ", we can also see from figure [ f6 ] , the standard deviation of speed resulting from assigning a random value of @xmath37 between 0 and 1 to each vehicle .",
    "we stress that for each car , this value of @xmath37 is not changed during the time evolution .",
    "therefore , we simulate , by means of random values of @xmath37 , traffic with non - homogeneous drivers : aggressive , non - aggressive and relaxed drivers .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ f6 ] the region where the standard deviation is negligible is close to that resulting from homogeneous drivers with @xmath80 ( high - level anticipation ) .",
    "however , the variance of vehicles speeds is @xmath81 larger than that corresponding to homogeneous drivers .    in order to elucidate the effects of anticipation with non - homogeneous drivers , the fundamental diagram obtained for this random @xmath37 case",
    "is compared with that for @xmath80 in a homogeneous system ( fig .",
    "note that the second slope corresponding to a mixed region is missing in the inhomogeneous system . in this case , the variance in the level of anticipation considered by the drivers produces higher fluctuations of speeds , and the flow decreases rapidly .",
    "therefore some anticipation driving schemes have a strong impact on the efficiency of the system .",
    "all of these findings require physical explanations @xcite .     case . ]      the behavior in the mixed states is determined by the existence of dense platoons in which vehicles move coherently with the same velocity @xmath0 . in the following",
    "these will be denoted as @xmath0-platoons .",
    "the stationary state then shows phase separation into a free - flow region and a @xmath0-platoon .",
    "this is similar to the behavior observed in models with slow - to - start rules where the system separates into free flow and a dense jam , i.e.  a @xmath1-platoon @xcite .",
    "[ fig_vel ] shows the velocity distributions of the different branches .",
    "it can be clearly seen that only cars with velocity @xmath0 and free flowing cars ( with velocity @xmath51 or @xmath82 due to the randomization ) exist .     and",
    "different values of @xmath37 . ]",
    "since the headway @xmath83 of a car @xmath11 inside a @xmath0-platoon is @xmath84 , its new velocity is determined by @xmath85 with @xmath86 $ ] . for a stable @xmath0-platoon",
    ", @xmath87 must be equal to @xmath0 .",
    "this gives the following stability condition : @xmath88 equation ( [ stabcond ] ) can be regarded as a condition for the anticipation parameter @xmath37 .",
    "it implies that a @xmath0-platoon can only be stable for @xmath89 where @xmath90 is defined by @xmath91 however , this condition is only necessary , not sufficient . the @xmath0-platoons that can be realized for a given @xmath37 also depend on the randomization @xmath19 .",
    "e.g.  for @xmath54 , platoons with @xmath92 occur , whereas for @xmath93 platoons with @xmath94 can not be observed in the infinite system although they might exist in small systems .",
    "simulations indicate that the slope of the mixed branch in the fundamental diagram has to be smaller than @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the average velocity in free flow : @xmath97 .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub - stability ] in more detail .",
    "another criterion for the stability of platoons can be derived from the condition that the inflow and outflow of the platoon have to be identical in the steady state . in the following",
    "we will derive estimates for these flows and in this way obtain the fundamental diagram in the mixed region .",
    "the outflow from a @xmath0-platoon is determined by the average time @xmath98 needed by the leading vehicle of the platoon to accelerate to velocity @xmath99 . assuming that this car has a large headway , this time is determined by the randomization constant @xmath19 through @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , in the free - flow region of the system , the average headway @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 .",
    "this consideration is very similar to the reasoning used in @xcite .",
    "assuming that the platoon consists of @xmath103 and the free - flow region of @xmath104 vehicles , we have @xmath105 here @xmath15 is the total number of cars .",
    "furthermore it has been assumed that the transition region between the platoon , where all cars have headway @xmath84 , and the free - flow region , where the average headway is given by @xmath101 , can be neglected .",
    "eliminating @xmath104 we find @xmath106    we now can calculated the flow @xmath107 of the corresponding phase - separated state .",
    "the average velocity @xmath108 in the presence of a @xmath0-platoon is given by @xmath109 a straightforward calculation using the results given above yields for the flow @xmath110 these results are in excellent agreement with the results from computer simulations .",
    "since @xmath111 it implies that all slopes corresponding to mixed states in the fundamental diagram are positive , except those for @xmath1-platoons ( @xmath112 see fig .",
    "[ f3b ] ) which are responsible for the jammed branch with low flow and negative slope .      for large densities all anticipatory curves ( @xmath113 ) collapse on one congested branch where the flow decreases with increasing density .",
    "simulations indicate that the structure of the corresponding states depends on the parameter regime . in the range ( [ vplatoonstability ] ) , where a @xmath0-platoon can exist ,",
    "the congested branch is characterized by the coexistence of a compact jam ( @xmath1-platoon ) and various @xmath0-platoons .",
    "the @xmath0-platoons are formed when a bunch of vehicles escapes from the jam . as argued in sec .",
    "[ sub - mixed ] , the first car escapes after an average waiting time @xmath100 . due to anticipation , with probability @xmath114 the second car can move in the same time - step , and so on .",

    ", we again neglect the transition regions and assume that only one jam with @xmath118 vehicles and @xmath119 @xmath0-platoons with a total number of @xmath103 cars are present .",

    "simulation results presented here for homogeneous drivers , corresponding to a cautious estimation of the preceding car velocity ( large @xmath37 ) , are in excellent agreement with the shape of the empirical fundamental diagram .    on the other hand , simulation results for driving schemes associated to intermediate - levels of anticipation with @xmath37 from @xmath142 to @xmath143 ( homogeneous drivers ) , exhibit phase separation in a certain density regime into a free - flow region and so - called @xmath0-platoons . in these dense platoons vehicles",
    "move with the same velocity @xmath0 and have vanishing headway .",
    "the velocity @xmath0 of the platoon is determined by the level of automation .",
    "this platoon formation observed in a mixed regime plays an important role in automated highway systems ( ahs ) to increase the vehicular capacity .",
    "therefore , results obtained help to elucidate the effects of anticipation coded in @xmath37 . the maximum flow and the density interval for free - flow regime go with the inverse of @xmath37 : smaller values of @xmath37 , ( greater estimation of the precedent car velocity ) imply larger flows and larger density interval for free - flow regime .",
    "this is also in accordance with , for example , the use of certain anticipation strategies to exploit the knowledge of the velocity of the precedent vehicle and so , reducing the distance among vehicles , increasing the capacity , and the density interval for free - flow regime .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the speed variance of individual vehicles also indicates the importance to anticipation effects .",
    "results indicate that level of anticipation should be determined based on the density .",
    "the highest - level of anticipation should be considered before the corresponding maximum density for free - flow regime is reached . after that maximum density , larger density requires lower - level of anticipation .",
    "therefore , this selection not only produces the highest flow , but also the lowest standard deviation , and so , efficiency is the highest .",
    "the considerations in this paper show the flexibility of the ca approach to more complex traffic flow problems .",
    "a simple and natural modification of the rules of the nasch model to consider different driving schemes allows us to describe the formation of coherently moving platoons observed in some anticipation schemes .",
    "we think that the results presented here are relevant to establish suitable levels of safety and automation not only for ahs , but also in real traffic .",
    "we stress that although in this paper the model is simulated in a single - lane on a ring , it is possible to apply it to complex highway topologies in a satisfactory way @xcite .    apart from its practical relevance for traffic problems , our work also shows interesting physical aspects .",
    "the model suggested here exhibits various kinds of phase separation phenomena . at intermediate densities , phase separation into a condensed ( @xmath0-platoon ) and a non - condensed ( free - flow ) phase can be observed .",
    "in contrast to most other models of driven diffusion , the condensed phase is moving coherently for @xmath3 . at high densities an even more surprising state is found that exhibits phase separation between different condensates , a non - moving one ( @xmath135 ) and several coherently moving platoons ( @xmath3 ) . to our knowledge such a behavior has not been observed before .",
    "it would be interesting to study these phases in more detail , especially since recently some progress in the understanding of phase separation in driven diffusive models has been made @xcite .",
    "work in this direction is currently in progress @xcite ."
