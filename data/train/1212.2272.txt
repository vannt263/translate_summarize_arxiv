    "due to their high selectivity and bandwidth as well as reduced size for a given resonant frequency , dielectric ceramics have been fully employed to manufacture filters to be used in wireless telecommunication systems @xcite .",
    "typical parameters for this application are a high unload quality factor @xmath4 higher than 20,000 at 2 ghz , which imply in selectivity ; a static permittivity @xmath5 higher than 30 , for miniaturization ; and a temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency @xmath6 tunable through zero , for thermal stability @xcite .",
    "ba - based ceramics bati@xmath7o@xmath8 and ba@xmath3ti@xmath8o@xmath9 were the first dielectric ceramics whose physical properties fulfil these technical requirements .",
    "@xcite today , the main compounds employed are based on catio@xmath2@xmath10ndalo@xmath2 and zrtio@xmath7@xmath10zn@xmath3nb@xmath3o@xmath11 solid solutions , which have , typically , @xmath12 and @xmath13 at 2 ghz .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ta - based ceramics as ba(zn@xmath0ta@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( bzt)@xcite and ba(mg@xmath0ta@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( bmt ) @xcite show very attractive @xmath4 values higher than 70,000 at 2 ghz that can increase the selectivity and optimize the bandwidth .",
    "however , the high cost of the ta@xmath3o@xmath14 start oxide used in preparation by solid state route of these ta - based ceramics increases the filter costs a lot @xcite .",
    "since nb and ta ions has the same ionic radii and nb@xmath3o@xmath14 is isostructural to and cheaper than ta@xmath3o@xmath14 , it is an excellent alternative way is to obtain dielectric ceramics based on the substitution of ta by nb .",
    "thus , several scientific investigations on the microwave properties of nb - based dielectric ceramics have been performed @xcite .",
    "so , despite some problems in achieving zero @xmath6 and optimizing @xmath4 , ba(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( bzn ) has great potential as the starting point for the development of dielectric ceramics for low cost devices @xcite .",
    "complex perovskites a(b@xmath15b@xmath16)o@xmath2 , as ba(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 , can be disordered or ordered according to the b@xmath17 and b@xmath18 ion site distributions .",
    "when b@xmath17 and b@xmath18 are randomly distributed into the b - site of the simple abo@xmath2 perovskite the compounds are disordered , crystallizing in a cubic structure with @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "however , when b@xmath17 and b@xmath18 are alternately distributed to the same site in a sequence @xmath20b@xmath17b@xmath18b@xmath18b@xmath17b@xmath18b@xmath18@xmath20 ( called 1:2 ordering ) , the structure crystallizes in a trigonal symmetry belonging to the @xmath21 space group .",
    "this order occurs along the @xmath22 direction and is very important to obtain high @xmath4 and low @xmath6.@xcite . despite several investigations in bzt and bzn compounds in bulk form @xcite",
    ", few works described the bzt film synthesis @xcite and the preparation of bzn films was not yet reported . in the bzt case",
    ", the authors observed that the films had low dielectric constant and high dielectric loss in comparison with the bulk ones , explaining the dependence of confocal raman spectra , dielectric constant and dielectric losses on the annealing conditions with basis on the degree of thin film densification and zn / ta order in the crystalline grains . in this work",
    "we describe the synthesis of bzn thin films obtained by polymeric precursor method deposited by spin coating .",
    "to prepare bzn thin films we used the polymeric precursors method using barium nitrate ( ba(no@xmath2)@xmath3 , sigma aldrich ) , zinc nitrate ( zn(no@xmath2)@xmath3 , vetec ) , and ammonium complex of niobium ( nh@xmath7(nbo(c@xmath3o@xmath7)@xmath3(h@xmath3o)@xmath3).3h@xmath3o , cbmm ) as metal sources .",
    "the barium polymeric precursor was obtained by dissolving 10 g of barium salt in 50 ml of distilled water .",
    "it was used the ratio 1:3 as molar ratio in the metal - citric acid .",
    "citric acid ( c@xmath23h@xmath24o@xmath11.h@xmath3o , proqumico ) was dissolved in distilled water and added to the solution of the metal salt kept stirring and heating to 60 - 70 @xmath25c followed by ethylene glycol ( hoch@xmath3ch@xmath3oh , merck ) addition in the ratio 1:1 in relation to citric acid .",
    "the same procedure was employed to obtain the zinc polymeric precursor . in order to obtain the niobium polymeric precursor ,",
    "it was dissolved 10 g of ammonium complex of niobium in 50 ml of distilled water under stirring and heating . then led to the precipitation of niobium oxi - hydroxide until ph of 9 in a thermal bath at 0 @xmath25c . filtered vacuum to hold the niobium hydroxide ( nb(oh)@xmath14 ) and elimination of oxalate ions with distilled water at 40 - 50 @xmath25c .",
    "it is important to control the ph of the mixture to the same value .",
    "this step avoided precipitations of the precursor .",
    "we used the gravimetric analysis using a muffle furnace at 900 @xmath25c for 1 h to determine the precipitate weight , in this case metal oxides obtained per gram of resin . with the gravimetric analysis , we determined the amount of each precursor polymer to obtain the mixture of the precursor bzn perovskite . after mixing , the three precursors on heating to 80 - 90 @xmath25c formed a polyester precursor with high viscosity and glassy .",
    "the viscosity of the solution was adjust by water evaporation to obtain an acceptable range of viscosity values , 12@xmath1014 mpa@xmath26s , measured at room temperature .",
    "bzn films were deposited onto pt / ti / sio2/si(100 ) substrates by spinning the deposition solution at 4.000 rpm for 20 s ( spin coating technique ) .",
    "all the films were deposited layer by layer and a densification stage at 400@xmath25c for 6h was employed after each layer deposition .",
    "a total of nine films were prepared . in six of them",
    ", we fixed the total number of layers ( 6 layers ) and ranging the calcination time ( 2h , 4h , 8h , 16h , 32h , 64h ) .",
    "in the three remaining , we fixed the calcination time ( 6h ) and ranging the number of layers ( 3 , 6 , 9 layers ) .",
    "the crystalline phase of the films was investigated by x - ray diffraction ( xrd@xmath10bruker d8 advance ) , in a continuous scanning mode using cu - k@xmath27 radiation , over a 2@xmath28 range 15@xmath29 - 95@xmath29 .",
    "the xrd patterns were compared with data from icsd ( inorganic crystal structure database , fiz karlsruhe and nist ) international diffraction database ( icsd#157044 ) .",
    "the confocal raman spectra and the confocal images were acquired with an alpha 300 system microscope ( witec , ulm , germany ) , equipped with a highly linear ( 0.02% ) stage , piezo - driven , and an objetive lens from nikon ( 100x , na = 0.9 ) .",
    "a nd : yag polarized laser ( @xmath30 = 532 nm ) was focused with a diffraction - limited spot size ( 0.61@xmath30/na ) and the raman light was detected by a high sensitivity , back illuminated spectroscopic ccd behind a 1800 g / mm grating .",
    "the spectrometer used was a ultra - high throughput witec uhts 300 with up to 70% throughput , designed specifically for raman microscopy .",
    "the surface raman image ( @xmath31 plane ) was carried out in a region of 20 x 20 @xmath32 m , with 60 points / line and 60 lines / image .",
    "the integration time in each point was 0.5 s. the region of the depth raman image ( @xmath33 plane ) was 10 @xmath32 m wide and 20 @xmath32 m deep , with 30 points / line and 30 lines / image .",
    "the integration time in each point was also 0.5 s.    the atomic force microscopy experiment was performed with an alpha 300 system microscope ( witec , ulm , germany ) , equipped with a contact - mode al - coated cantilever with force constant of 0.2 n / m .",
    "the treatment of the afm images was done using the wsxm software @xcite .",
    "figure [ bznfilmdrx ] shows the x - ray diffraction patterns obtained for the all deposited films .",
    "the plane indexation was performed following the ordered trigonal @xmath21 structure .",
    "it is important to point out that the peak around @xmath34 , which indicates the superstructure reflecting the ordering of zn / nb ions at b@xmath17/b@xmath18 sites , was not clearly observed .",
    "this is due to the low diffraction intensity usually observed in thin films . also , some partial disorder is expected due the high zno evaporation rates which difficult the obtainment of zn compounds as showed by varma et al by chemical methods @xcite .",

    "the observed bands are shown in table [ bznfilmmodes ] together with their assignments which were performed with basis in previous works @xcite .",
    "the spectra confirm the partially ordered trigonal structure assumed by the films .",
    "the local disorder is indicated by the modes 10(11 ) and 12(13 ) , which are associated to the nb(zn ) ion in the zn(nb ) site @xcite . however , although the x - ray measurements have not detected , the spectra also show the presence of banb@xmath3o@xmath23 as secondary phase .",

    "the observation of secondary phases in films deposited by chemical methods is usual @xcite .",
