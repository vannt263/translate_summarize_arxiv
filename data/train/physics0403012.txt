    "the electric field strength as well as the frequency of the laser field and the kinetic energy of the incoming electron being key parameters , the study of the process of mott scattering in the presence of an elliptically polarized laser field introduces a new key parameter , namely the degree of ellipticity @xmath0 . the cross section dependency on this new key parameter",
    "is reported .",
    "the general features of the mott scattering process are qualitatively modified when a laser field is present and this is particularly true when one study the spin - dependent relativistic mott scattering .",
    "not only it is important to take care of the fact that the electron is a fermion but also to describe this particle by the appropriate wave function in a non - perturbative way .",
    "this is done by using the dirac - volkov wave functions @xcite which contain the interaction of the electron with the laser field to all orders .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the theory in the first born approximation . in section iii , we discuss the analytical results for the spin - unpolarized differential cross section modified by the laser field and analyze their dependencies on the new relevant parameter , that is the degree of ellipticity @xmath0 .",

    "we use atomic units @xmath1 and work with the metric tensor @xmath2 .",
    "we treat the laser field classically since we are considering intensities that do not allow pair creation @xcite .",
    "the four potential corresponding to the laser field satisfies the lorentz condition @xmath3 and is given by    @xmath4    with @xmath5 and where @xmath6 is the degree of ellipticity of the laser field .",
    "the four vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 satisfy the following relations @xmath9 @xmath10 and the lorentz condition @xmath11 implies @xmath12 .",
    "the linear polarization is obtained for @xmath13 and the circular polarization is obtained for @xmath14 . the electric field associated with the potential of the laser field",
    "is    @xmath15      the interaction potential is the coulomb potential of a target nucleus of charge @xmath16",
    "@xmath17    and in the first born approximation , the transition matrix element for the transition ( @xmath18 ) is    @xmath19    the dirac - volkov wave functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 describe the incident and scattered electron respectively .",
    "such wave functions normalized to the volume @xmath22 are @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents a dirac bispinor normalized as @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the quasi - impulsion acquired by the electron in the presence of the laser field @xmath27 the quantity @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where the feynmann slash notation is used @xcite : for a given four vector @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 .",
    "finally the averaged squared potential @xmath33 is given by    @xmath34    from which one deduces @xmath35 for the case of a circular polarization of the laser field and @xmath36 for the case of a linear polarization of the laser field .",

    "( [ 11 ] ) is the relativistic generalization of the bunkin and fedorov @xcite treatment and it contains the degree of ellipticity of the laser field as a new key parameter .",
    "in this section , we discuss the numerical simulations for the differential cross sections of the mott scattering by an elliptically polarized laser field .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that the target is a proton having a charge @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath37 axis is set along the direction of the field wave vector @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 with the vectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 from which one deduces that @xmath76 .",
    "thus , as found by s.m .",
    "li @xcite for the linear polarization , we have @xmath77 and for the case of circular polarization @xcite , @xmath78 . the laser frequency used is @xmath79 @xmath80 which corresponds to a photon energy @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "the incident electron kinetic energy is @xmath83 @xmath84 which corresponds to a relativistic parameter @xmath85 and the electric field strength has the value @xmath86",
    "@xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 .",
    "the various differential cross sections are plotted as functions of the angle @xmath90 . for small scattering angles ,",
    "typically ( @xmath91 ) , ( @xmath92 ) , the summed spin - unpolarized differential cross sections are sharply peaked around @xmath93 and are all close to the corresponding unpolarized laser - free differential cross section given in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "@xmath84 as a function of the angle @xmath90 scaled in @xmath94 .",
    "the electric field strength is @xmath86 @xmath80 and the laser frequency is @xmath79 @xmath80 . the corresponding mott - scattering geometry is given in the text.,width=4,height=4 ]    the three dcss corresponding to @xmath13 , @xmath95 and @xmath14 are given in fig .",
    "1 together with the laser - free dcs for the geometry ( @xmath96 ) , ( @xmath97 ) . we obtain four almost indistinguishable curves .",
    "thus , at small angles , the summed differential cross sections are almost unmodified by the laser field and its polarization does not play a key role .",
    "the physical explanation of this observation is that classically , when the particles are close to the small angle scattering region , this corresponds to large impact parameters and the incident electron does not deviate notably from its trajectory . for other scattering angles , ( @xmath98 ) , ( @xmath99 ) ,",
    "the situation changes drastically since for medium and large scattering angles , the momentum transfer during the mott scattering is large and a significant number of photons can be exchanged with the laser field .    in fig .",
    "2 , we compare the three dcss corresponding to @xmath100 , @xmath95 and @xmath14 together with the laser - free dcs for the geometry ( @xmath101 ) , ( @xmath102 ) for an exchange of @xmath103 photons . in this geometry , the effect of the laser field polarization is clearly shown since the three dcss are now well distinguishable .",
    "one has to sum over a very large number of photons to recover the laser - free dcs .",
    "furthermore , all numerical simulations have shown the following .",
    "the dcs for linear polarization is always higher than the two others .",
    "the dcs for elliptical polarization is lower or higher than the dcs for circular polarization depending on the value of the degree of ellipticity @xmath0 .",
    "photons scaled in @xmath104 .",
    "as in fig . 1 , @xmath86 @xmath80 and @xmath79 @xmath80",
    ". the corresponding mott - scattering geometry is explained in the text.,width=5,height=3 ]    to have an idea about the behaviour of the dcs as a function of the degree of ellipticity @xmath0 , we have obtained a three dimensional curve corresponding to the same geometry as in fig . 2 but for a degree of ellipticity @xmath0 varying from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "there are oscillations of the dcs for the elliptical polarization and the dcs for linear polarization is always the higher dcs .",
    "these oscillations decrease as the number of photons exchanged is increased . the convergence towards the laser - free dcs is faster for the linear polarization of the laser field . for the circular polarization",
    ", this convergence is easily obtained when one finds the value for the convergence corresponding to the linear polarization whereas it is much more difficult to infer from the previous results for which value of the number of photons exchanged , the dcs for the elliptical polarization will converge to the laser - free dcs .",
    "however , depending on the value of @xmath0 and in the non relativistic regime we have chosen , this number is @xmath107 photons . when the incident electron relativistic parameter is increased from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , the previous mentioned results remain valid but the corresponding dcss are very small indicating a small probability that the very fast projectile electron will exchange photons with the radiation field . as for the behaviour of the dcss with respect to the degree of ellipticity ,",
    "the ellipically and circularly polarized laser modified cross sections become more sharply peaked around the angle @xmath110 .",
    "a similar result has been reported [ 3 ] .",
    "in this work , we have extended the study of the mott scattering process of an electron by a charged nucleus to the case of a general polarization .",
    "we have shown that the mott - scattering geometry as well as the key parameters such as the electric field strength and the incident electron kinetic energy influence the behaviour of the dcss . moreover ,",
    "the degree of ellipticity @xmath0 is also a key parameter for the description of the mott scattering process particularly in the region of large momentum transfer and for a number of photons exchanged lower than that for which the dcss tend to the laser - free one .",
