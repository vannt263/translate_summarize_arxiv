    "the theoretical precision is limited by @xmath3-spin - breaking corrections , which do not allow us  unless there is significant progress to calculate them  to take full advantage of the data to be collected in the era of belle ii and the lhcb upgrade .    in view of this situation",
    ", we proposed a new strategy to fully exploit the physics potential of the non - leptonic and decays to extract @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the strategy utilizes the @xmath3-spin relation between these two decays for theoretically well behaved quantities , thereby resulting in a very robust situation with respect to @xmath3-spin - breaking effects .",
    "the new key elements are the differential rates of the semileptonic decays @xmath215 and @xmath216 , which enter ratios with the and decay rates @xmath170 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "in fact , only the double ratio @xmath170/@xmath169 enters our strategy , which is an advantage from the experimental point of view as uncertainties cancel .",
    "a theoretical advantage is that the form factors now enter only in a double ratio , which is equal to 1 with excellent precision . in our new strategy ,",
    "non - factorizable @xmath3-spin - breaking corrections to the notoriously difficult to calculate penguin , exchange and penguin - annihilation topologies only contribute through the ratios @xmath129 and @xmath174 .",
    "as we have shown , these quantities are very robust with respect to @xmath3-spin - breaking effects . on the other hand , the original strategy",
    "is limited by leading non - factorizable @xmath3-spin - breaking effects that emerge from penguin topologies .",
    "the cp - violating observables of allow us to determine the  effective \" @xmath217 mixing phase @xmath218 , which is a pure experimental quantity . in order to extract the mixing phase @xmath6 from @xmath218 , we have to subtract the hadronic phase shift @xmath172 , which depends on non - perturbative quantities . in the upgrade era",
    ", @xmath218 can be measured with an uncertainty at the @xmath24 level .",
    "consequently , our goal is to match this very impressive experimental precision by theory , determining @xmath172 with similar uncertainty .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath216 decay , a key input for our new strategy , has not yet been measured .",
    "we strongly advocate analyses of this channel at belle ( ii ) and lhcb , preferably extracting @xmath169 or the ratio @xmath202 directly from the experimental data . in order to illustrate the strength of our new method , we use data for .",
    "this decay is related to by a @xmath3-spin relation at the spectator quark level if the small contributions from exchange and penguin annihilation topologies are neglected .",
    "we find a precision for @xmath172 of @xmath219 , which shows impressively the power of our strategy .",
    "moreover , we obtain excellent agreement with the picture of the @xmath3-spin symmetry , excluding anomalously large corrections .",
    "the determination of @xmath172 is affected by experimental and theoretical uncertainties . for a perfect theoretical situation ,",
    "measurements of @xmath170 and @xmath169 with @xmath171 precision are required to obtain a @xmath24 precision for @xmath172 .",
    "the theoretical precision is limited by @xmath3-spin - breaking corrections to quantities which have very favourable structures . in order to fully exploit the precision of our strategy",
    ", we need information both for the penguin ratio @xmath133 and for the exchange and penguin - annihilation parameter @xmath191 .",
    "the penguin parameter @xmath133 can be studied with the help of the pure penguin decays and , which offer an interesting laboratory for the upgrade era .",
    "since the current data for these modes are limited , we have also used the charged decays @xmath220 and @xmath221 to constrain the size of @xmath133 . in summary , using these decays , we find an uncertainty for the relevant ratio @xmath222 at the @xmath152 level .",
    "we have presented a strategy to further reduce this uncertainty , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchartxip ] .",
    "future measurements of the cp asymmetries of and allow us to determine the exchange and penguin - annihilation contributions with high precision",
    ". we have discussed the correlation between these cp asymmetries following from the current data , resulting in an interesting picture for the future data taking , and presented scenarios of future measurements and their use to pin down the exchange and penguin - annihilation contributions even further . for the current data , we use ratios of different @xmath223 ( @xmath224 )",
    "decays and find a contribution of @xmath225 , which results in a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath183 for the exchange and penguin - annihilation ratio @xmath174 .",
    "combining the different sources of theoretical uncertainty , we find a theoretical precision of @xmath172 at the @xmath180 level .",
    "we have discussed different strategies to reduce this uncertainty further with future experimental data , and have illustrated them with various scenarios , showing that a future ultimate precision at the @xmath24 level is within reach .",
    "consequently , the new strategy has the potential to extract @xmath6 from cp violation in with a theoretical precision matching experiment .",
    "the key question is whether the corresponding value will eventually show a discrepancy with respect to the clean sm prediction @xmath226 and determinations from other decays , in particular @xmath227 .",
