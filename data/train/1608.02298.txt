    "the aim of this letter is to explore the mechanism underlying the abrupt suppression of the long range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order observed in the lightly hole - doped cuprates . as is well known the @xmath0 undoped quantum af exhibits at zero temperature the af long range order ( lro ) that is completely destroyed by a surprisingly low doping .",
    "it is very reasonable to assume that the strong electron correlations are at work in this case .",
    "technically , the lightly doped regime is pretty hard to address because , precisely under this condition , the constraint of no double electron occupancy ( ndo ) is fully at work .",
    "this implies that , due to the strong on - site coulomb repulsion , two lattice electrons can not hop onto one and the same lattice site regardless of their spin projection .",
    "such a local restriction on a structure of the hilbert space is very hard to implement analytically in a reliable and controlled manner . on the other hand ,",
    "slave - particle mean - field theories that treat the local ndo constraint globally predict a nonphysically large value of the critical doping @xcite .",
    "the ndo constraint drives the theory into a strong - coupling regime , which calls for proper technical tools .",
    "some progress can be achieved by employing the earlier established mapping of the @xmath1 model of strongly correlated electrons onto the kondo - heisenberg model at a dominantly large kondo coupling @xcite .",
    "being a slave - particle theory , such an approach possesses however a few important advantages over the conventional slave - particle theories .",
    "first of all , the strength of electron correlations is now encoded into a single global parameter - a kondo coupling .",
    "varying its magnitude enables us to get important insights as to in what way the strong electron correlations affect the underlying physics .",
    "in particular we show that the local ndo constraint is responsible for a rapid destruction of the af quasi lro ( qlro ) with doping .",
    "if the ndo constraint is ignored the qlro is restored .",
    "the critical hole concentration at which the af qlro disappears acquires a reasonably low value .",
    "additionally , the proposed spin - dopon theory explicitly takes into account the dual nature of the constrained lattice electrons . in the underdoped cuprates , one striking feature is the simultaneous localized and itinerant nature of the lattice electrons",
    "such a duality appears as an explicit manifestation of the local mott physics and is shown to be a direct consequence of the local ndo constraint .",
    "moreover , the itinerant - localized model provides a convenient new set of coordinates well suited for numerical simulations .",
    "specifically , one can vary the strength of the electron correlations by simply varying a single global parameter - the ( kondo ) coupling between the itinerant and localized electrons . in particular , classical monte carlo simulations for large clusters",
    "were successfully used in studying the electron spin correlations in the full ising version of the @xmath0 @xmath1 model in the spin - dopon representation.@xcite it was shown that the af lro disappears already at the doping of the order of a few percent .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the ndo constraint is responsible for the smearing out of the magnetic order .",
    "however , these results were obtained within a simplified model with the transverse components of the on - site electron spin being self - consistently neglected .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply the _ quantum _ monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations to explore the quantum spin dynamics of the underdoped cuprates within the standard @xmath2 invariant @xmath0 @xmath1 model .",
    "we intend to explore the issue as to whether or not the ndo constraint still plays a dominant role in the disruption of the magnetic order in the lightly doped regime .",
    "one should however keep in mind that the qmc method restricts ourselves to deal with finite temperatures and finite lattice clusters . as a result , this approach can not capture a true lro in @xmath0 .",
    "since the af correlation length remains finite , we consider a finite - size system away from the critical point .",
    "a full theory of such systems is not available yet .",
    "however , at sufficiently low doping , the correlation length is much larger than a characteristic cluster size .",
    "this manifest itself as a qlro .",
    "what is important is that the qmc method enables us to observe a rapid destruction of the qlro with increasing doping and the formation of the short range order ( sro ) instead .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the local ndo constraint plays a dominant role in destroying the magnetic order at finite doping in the standard @xmath1 model .",
    "to start with , let us briefly review the kondo - heisenberg model approach to strongly correlated electron systems . to include both itinerant and localized aspects of the constraint electrons into consideration , on equal footing , ribeiro and wen proposed a slave - particle spin - dopon representation of the projected electron operators in the enlarged hilbert space @xcite , @xmath3 in this framework , the localized electron is represented by the lattice spin @xmath4 whereas the doped hole ( dopon ) is described by the projected hole operator , @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the physical content of the spin - dopon representation ( [ 1.2 ] ) can be clarified as follows .",
    "first of all , we represent the spin degrees of freedom in terms of chargeless fermions ( spinons ) , @xmath8 @xmath9 following this , we introduce the operator @xcite @xmath10 which destroys the on - site spin - dopon singlet state ( holon ) . the physical electron operator ( [ 1.2 ] ) then effectively reduces to the spinon - holon decomposition : @xmath11    in terms of the projected electron operators , the constraint of no double occupancy ( ndo ) takes on the form @xmath12",
    "\\a ) +    \\b ) +    it singles out the physical @xmath13 on - site hilbert space . only under this condition",
    "are the projected electron operators isomorphic to the hubbard operators . within the spin - dopon representation",
    ", the ndo reduces to a kondo - type interaction constraint @xcite , @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the dopon spin operator and @xmath16 the pauli vector .",
    "equivalently , eq.([cnstr ] ) can be written in the form @xmath17    proceeding with eq.([cnstr ] ) we end up with the lattice kondo - heisenberg model which , at strong coupling @xmath18 , is equivalent to the original @xmath1 model @xcite : @xmath19    the unphysical doubly occupied electron states are separated from the physical sector by an energy gap @xmath20 . in the @xmath21 limit , i.e. in the limit in which @xmath22 is much larger than any other existing energy scale in the problem , those states are automatically excluded from the hilbert space . in spite of the global character of the parameter @xmath22 , it enforces the ndo constraint locally due to the fact that the on - site physical hilbert subspace corresponds to zero eigenvalues of the constraint , whereas the nonphysical subspace is spanned by the eigenvectors with strictly positive eigenvalues . in @xmath23 , eq.([2.7 ] ) reproduces the well - known exact results for the @xmath1 model.@xcite",
    "close to half filling , where the density of doped holes is small @xmath24 , one can make the change @xmath25 one can safely ignore the \" tilde  sign for the dopon operators as well .",
    "the spin - dopon representation of the @xmath1 hamiltonian for the underdoped cuprates then takes a form of the kondo - heisenberg lattice model at a dominantly large kondo coupling @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in the spin - dopon representation ( [ 04 ] ) , the on - site hilbert space is spanned by the vectors @xmath29 , with @xmath30 labeling the lattice spin projection and @xmath31 labeling dopon state .",
    "explicitly they are numerated by an integer @xmath32 as given in table [ tab:1 ] .       in this case , the @xmath33 becomes diagonal in the @xmath34 representation : @xmath35 where the unphysical spin triplet states @xmath36 enter with eigenvalue @xmath22 .",
    "the physical vectors @xmath37 that describe the vacancies and lattice spins correspond to zero eigenvalues of @xmath38 .    in our calculations",
    "we use continuous time world line qmc method .",
    "it is based on the exact expression for the expansion of the partition function in the interaction picture , and in our notation this gives @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the @xmath41-ordering operator .",
    "the simulation is running in the grand canonical ensemble by using worm algorithm .",
    "it allows to make calculations more effective by adding the fictitious configurations to the true ones , and to keep number of particles under control at the same time .",
    "furthermore , by the fact that the cpu time depends linearly on the lattice size and the average sign remains large enough , which helps to keep errors in acceptable limits , simulation can be made at relatively large lattice size .",
    "all numerical results were obtained for a @xmath42 lattice cluster with periodic boundary condition .",
    "however this size is not enough to ensure that the finite - size effects have no significant effects on the result . to make these effects negligible the size of the lattice cluster",
    "should be extended to at least the @xmath43 one .",
    "it should be noted that , in addition to finite - size effects , the sign problem also contributes to errors .",
    "this problem is connected with the appearance of the negative statistical weights which leads to a necessity of the alternating series summation to calculate the average values  a typical problem in the qmc method .",
    "as a result , the errors increase exponentially with decreasing temperature which rules out an acceptable accuracy at low temperatures .    to estimate the dependence of af order from the doping level we compute the spin - spin correlation function @xmath44 for the physical electron operators .",
    "this is calculated with @xmath45 and a fixed number of dopons , @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is radius - vector of the site @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the lattice constant and @xmath54 means an average over the spin configurations generated in the qmc run . in all the figures showing",
    "@xmath44 we use logarithmic scale for the vertical axis .",
    "therefore , for the lro , qlro and sro , the @xmath44 should be represented asymptotically by a constant , a logarithmic function , and a straight line , respectively .",
    "fig.[ris : logg(r ) ] displays the electron spin - spin correlators for the different doping levels .",
    "the critical hole concentration varies from around @xmath55 at @xmath56 to @xmath57 at @xmath58 . due to a finite lattice size as well as a finite temperature a true long - range af order",
    "manifest itself as a qlro even at a very small doping .",
    "the suppression of the true lro corresponds to the destruction of the qlro due to the emergence of the short - range af correlations .",
    "the obtained values of the critical hole concentrations do not necessarily coincide with the true ones to be computed at zero temperature in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however their magnitudes are reasonably small .",
    "fig.[ris : lambda ] displays the spin - spin correlators , @xmath59 , for @xmath56 and @xmath58 at @xmath55 and @xmath57 for different values of @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "it is clearly seen that the qlro is restored as @xmath22 decreases .",
    "the local ndo constraint plays the dominating role in the destruction of the long - range af state . at @xmath60 ,",
    "the spin - spin correlation functions become almost identical to each other .",
    "this indicates that finite but large enough values of @xmath22 already provide a reliable description of the existing strong correlations . in this limit",
    ", the high and low energy itinerant fermions can not be separated out and this is another manifestation of the duality of the lattice electron nature .",
    "it should be noted that the physical meanings of the kondo coupling @xmath22 within the conventional phenomenological spin - fermion model @xcite and in our eq.([04 ] ) are completely different . in the former case , it represents a sdw gap that can evolve from small to large values . in our theory",
    ", the only meaningful value of the kondo coupling is that of @xmath61 to take proper care of the ndo constraint .",
    "to conclude , we investigate the spin - spin correlation functions in the underdoped @xmath1 model numerically by employing quantum monte carlo simulations on finite clusters .",
    "our main conclusion is that it is the local ndo constraint that is behind the rapid suppression of the af qlro at surprisingly small doping level .",
    "in contrast , any mean - field global treatment of the local ndo results in unphysically large values of the critical hole concentration .    a further possible application of the present approach might be that to theoretically explore an experimentally observed instability towards a formation of a charge order in the pseudogap phase at @xmath62 there is a strong evidence that the observed charge order is due to strong electron correlations @xcite .",
    "the spin - dopon representation of the @xmath1 model provides a natural framework to address this problem . by varying @xmath22",
    ", we would be able to vary the strength of the correlations to explicitly explore the impact of the ndo on the charge order formation .",
    "this is already in progress and results will be presented elsewhere .",
