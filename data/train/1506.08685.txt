    "the results of @xcite were extended in @xcite , where a diffeomorphism classification of positively curved riemannian manifolds with maximal symmetry rank was obtained .",
    "this work again relies on the existence of fixed point sets of isometric circle actions , but also uses techniques of alexandrov geometry in the positive curvature setting .",
    "we note that the maximal symmetry rank theorem was generalized to closed alexandrov spaces of curvature greater than or equal to @xmath49 by harvey and searle @xcite and we will make use of their result later .",
    "rong @xcite then showed that in the almost maximal symmetry rank case , that is , for @xmath53 , in dimension @xmath46 the manifold must be homeomorphic to a sphere , which , with the proof of the poincar conjecture , can be improved to diffeomorphism , and he found a number of topological restrictions in higher dimensions . wilking @xcite significantly improved these results , showing that an @xmath34-dimensional riemannian manifold with an isometric action of rank approximately @xmath54 is homeomorphic to a sphere or a quaternionic projective space or has the cohomology ring of a complex projective space .",

    "( 2 ) , the quotient of @xmath5 is a torus orbifold of non - negative curvature . in case ( 2a ) , we use proposition [ c : wpd ] to show that @xmath5 is equivariantly diffeomorphic to an @xmath34-dimensional manifold @xmath502 which admits a freely acting torus of rank @xmath13 , such that @xmath573 is a torus manifold admitting a family of metrics with almost non - negative curvature and the quotient @xmath574 is weight - preserving diffeomorphic to @xmath575 . by theorem [ locallystandard ] , we see that the torus manifold @xmath573 is locally standard and then we can once again use theorem [ momentangle ] to obtain the result .    for case ( 2b ) , one can show that there is a closed , principal @xmath93 bundle over @xmath576 , with simply - connected total space , @xmath577 , admitting a @xmath578-invariant family of metrics of almost non - negative curvature and such that the rank of the torus action on @xmath238 is equal to the number of facets of the orbit space @xmath579 .",
