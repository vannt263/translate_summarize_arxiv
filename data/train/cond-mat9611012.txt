    "the techniques now available in the field of _ ab initio _",
    "quantum many - body theory have become increasingly refined over the last decade or so .",
    "this is particularly true for what is nowadays recognised as one of the most powerful modern techniques , namely , the coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) .",
    "the results obtained from the ccm have become fully competitive with series expansions , variational calculations and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations ( for the cases in which qmc may be applied ) .",
    "quantum magnets not only provide useful models of many physically realisable magnetic systems but also serve as prototypical models of quantum many - body systems .",
    "their rich phase diagrams due to strong quantum effects have naturally provided an excellent test - bed where the above - mentioned methods can be applied and further refined .",
    "one example demonstrating rich and initially unexpected behaviour is provided by the haldane conjecture@xcite , which states that the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) possesses an excitation gap , in sharp contrast to its spin-@xmath0 counterpart .",
    "this was surprising at the time because conventional spin - wave theory predicts a gapless excitation spectrum regardless of spin magnitude .",
    "however , the haldane conjecture has subsequently been confirmed by numerical calculations@xcite . moreover , in the aftermath of the discovery of the superconducting cuprates , much effort has been devoted to uncovering such subtle effects as spin - nematic , spin - peierls and chiral spin liquid orderings in two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum antiferromagnets , among which the frustrated quantum antiferromagnets on the triangular and the kagom lattices have recently attracted considerable theoretical attention .    the ccm has been applied to various quantum magnets over the past six years .",
    "the first application of the ccm to these systems was performed by roger and hetherington@xcite , who obtained good results at low levels of approximation for the ground - state energy of both the 1d chain and the 2d square - lattice haf , and also for solid @xmath1he where ring exchanges of nuclear spins are considered . since then",
    "the ccm has been applied to the isotropic ( heisenberg ) and anisotropic haf ( or model ) in 1d and on the 2d square lattice , both for spin-@xmath0@xcite systems and higher spins systems@xcite ; to the spin-1 heisenberg - biquadratic model@xcite ; and to such _ frustrated _ spin models as the spin-@xmath0 @xmath2-@xmath3 ( or majumdar - ghosh ) model@xcite and the 2d triangular lattice haf@xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the spin-1 easy - plane ferromagnet@xcite . among these ,",
    "et al._@xcite not only put forth several systematic _ localised _ approximation schemes to perform higher - order calculations yielding good results on the ground - state sublattice magnetisations and approximate excitation spectra , but also used an infinite - order , two - body approximation scheme to obtain evidence of a zero - temperature quantum phase transitions .",
    "moreover , the systematic inclusion of spin - spin correlations based on a _ dimerised _ state has also been made possible within the framework of the ccm@xcite , to study spin - peierls ordering .",
    "this may provide a possible inroad to probe more subtle topological order in the absence of _ solid _ order , as in the case of the chiral spin liquid@xcite .",
    "the quantitative description of such phases remains one of the most challenging problems for modern microscopic quantum many - body theory in general , and the ccm in particular .",
    "more recently , attention has been given to extending the ccm calculations to higher orders@xcite in the particular case of the _ xxz _ model , by using a _ localised _ approximation scheme , and by taking into account multi - spin correlations on up to @xmath4 contiguous lattice sites in 1d and on up to @xmath5 contiguous lattice sites in 2d .",
    "the ground - state energies , for example , are found to be in excellent agreement ( i.e. , within about @xmath6 ) with the exact result in 1d , and with those obtained from spin - wave theory@xcite , series expansion@xcite and qmc calculations@xcite in 2d .",
    "however , it is fair to say that in 2d , to achieve the same accuracy on other more interesting physical quantities such as the ground - state sublattice magnetisation and the excitation spectrum , and to further clarify the nature of zero - temperature quantum phase transitions , the inclusion of multi - spin correlations of still higher orders is clearly needed .",
    "since the extent of the task of determining the ccm equations and solving them grows extremely rapidly with the approximation level , efficient algorithms for performing the ccm calculations thus become indispensable@xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present work is two - fold : ( 1 ) we analyse in detail the computational aspects of the ccm in the context of quantum antiferromagnets , in order to devise an efficient implementation and to show how the systematic inclusion of multi - spin correlations can be made simple ; and ( 2 ) we revisit the spin-@xmath7 quantum antiferromagnets on both the square and the triangular lattices by utilising this algorithm in a way which now enables us to increase the number of independent and _ localised _ multi - spin configurations to be considered by at least an order of magnitude over previous calculations . in this article",
    "we focus on the above two models in the regimes where a nel - like order represents the corresponding classical limit .",
    "the present method , however , should be of general utility to quantum magnets where a spin - peierls order is relevant , for example .",
    "a brief description of the contents of this article now follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe how a reformulation of the ccm problem has been achieved .",
    "the characteristic ccm similarity transform of the spin operators is evaluated at a very general approximation level , and the hamiltonian is reformulated purely in terms of spin - raising operators for a spin-@xmath0 system .",
    "we also show that the form of the new hamiltonian easily lends itself to a localised set of approximations called the lsub_m _ scheme .",
    "in so doing the ccm technique is itself clarified .",
    "the computational method used to determine our fundamental set of configurations within this approximation scheme is described , and the derivation of the resulting ccm equations is discussed in detail .",
    "the method is then applied to the square - lattice spin-@xmath0 _ xxz _ antiferromagnet , and the triangular - lattice spin-@xmath0 anisotropic antiferromagnet@xcite in secs .",
    "iii and iv respectively .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v , where we also discuss possibilities for further extending our computational solution to even higher - order calculations by making use of parallel processing and other strategies .",
    "since detailed descriptions of the fundamentals of the ccm are available in the literature , we only highlight the essential ingredients of its application here .",
    "the exact ket and bra ground - state energy eigenvectors , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , of a many - body system described by a hamiltonian @xmath10 , @xmath11 are parametrised within the single - reference ccm as follows : @xmath12 the single model or reference state @xmath13 is required to have the property of being a cyclic vector with respect to two well - defined abelian subalgebras of _ multi - configurational _ creation operators @xmath14 and their hermitian - adjoint destruction counterparts @xmath15 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 plays the role of a vacuum state with respect to a suitable set of ( mutually commuting ) many - body creation operators @xmath14 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , the identity operator .",
    "these operators are complete in the many - body hilbert ( or fock ) space , @xmath18 also , the _ correlation operator _",
    "@xmath19 is decomposed entirely in terms of these creation operators @xmath14 , which , when acting on the model state ( @xmath20 ) , create excitations about the model state .",
    "we note that although the manifest hermiticity , ( @xmath21 ) , is lost , the intermediate normalisation condition @xmath22 is explicitly imposed .",
    "the _ correlation coefficients _",
    "@xmath23 are regarded as being independent variables , even though formally we have the relation , @xmath24 the full set @xmath23 thus provides a complete description of the ground state . for instance , an arbitrary operator @xmath25 will have a ground - state expectation value given as , @xmath26 we note that the exponentiated form of the ground - state ccm parametrisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ensures the correct counting of the _ independent _ and excited correlated many - body clusters with respect to @xmath13 which are present in the exact ground state @xmath8 .",
    "it also ensures the exact incorporation of the goldstone linked - cluster theorem , which itself guarantees the size - extensivity of all relevant extensive physical quantities .",
    "one crucial difference between the ccm parametrisation of the ground state and those used in spin - wave@xcite and variational monte carlo calculations@xcite is that although they all adopt an exponentiated form , the former ( ccm ) contains spin - raising operators only .",
    "the determination of the correlation coefficients @xmath23 is achieved by taking appropriate projections onto the ground - state schrdinger equations of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , they may be determined variationally by requiring the ground - state energy expectation functional @xmath27 , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , to be stationary with respect to variations in each of the ( independent ) variables of the full set .",
    "we thereby easily derive the following coupled set of equations , @xmath28 { \\rm e}^s|\\phi\\rangle   = 0 , \\;\\ ; i \\neq 0 \\;\\ ; . \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq7 ] ) also shows that the ground - state energy at the stationary point has the simple form @xmath29 it is important to realize that this ( bi-)variational formulation does _ not _ lead to an upper bound for @xmath30 when the summations for @xmath19 and @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) are truncated , due to the lack of exact hermiticity when such approximations are made .",
    "however , it is clear that the important hellmann - feynman theorem _ is _ preserved in all such approximations .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) represents a coupled set of nonlinear polynomial equations for the _ c_-number correlation coefficients @xmath32 . the nested commutator expansion of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian , @xmath33 + { 1\\over2 ! } [ [ h , s],s ] + \\cdots   \\;\\ ; ,   \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] together with the fact that all of the individual components of @xmath19 in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) commute with one another , imply that each element of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is linked directly to the hamiltonian in each of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "thus , each of the coupled equations ( [ eq7 ] ) is of linked cluster type .",
    "furthermore , each of these equations is of finite length when expanded , since the otherwise infinite series of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) will always terminate at a finite order , provided ( as is usually the case ) that each term in the second - quantised form of the hamiltonian @xmath10 contains a finite number of single - body destruction operators , defined with respect to the reference ( vacuum ) state @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the ccm parametrisation naturally leads to a workable scheme which can be efficiently implemented computationally .",
    "it is also important to note that at the heart of the ccm lies a similarity transformation , in contrast with the unitary transformation in a standard variational formulation in which the bra state @xmath34 is simply taken as the explicit hermitian adjoint of @xmath8 .        in this section ,",
    "the general formalism of the ccm outlined in the previous section will be henceforth applied to spin-@xmath35 quantum magnets with the emphasis on the common computational aspects involved in its implementation .",
    "further model - specific details are deferred until secs .",
    "iii and iv .    to be specific ,",
    "in this article we restrict ourselves to spin-@xmath36 quantum antiferromagnets in the regimes where the corresponding classical limit is described by a generalised nel - like ordering , i.e. , where all spins on each sublattice are separately aligned in the coordinates of a global quantisation axis . however , it is a simple task ( see secs .",
    "iii and iv for details ) to introduce a different local quantisation axis on each sublattice by a suitable spin - rotation transformation , such that the above nel - like state becomes a fully aligned ( `` ferromagnetic '' ) configuration in the local spin coordinates .",
    "this `` ferromagnetic '' state , @xmath13 , will be chosen as the uncorrelated ccm model state , where , in the local axes , all spins point along the respective negative _ z_-axis , @xmath37 the correlation operator @xmath19 is then decomposed wholly in terms of sums of products of single spin - raising operators , @xmath38 , again defined with respect to the local quantisation axes , @xmath39 s^+_{i_1 } + [ i_1 i_2 ] s^+_{i_1 } s^+_{i_2 } + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\,\\ , , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] and so on stand for the corresponding ( symmetric ) spin - correlation coefficients ( recall @xmath32 in sec .",
    "iia ) specified by the sets of site indices , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and so on , on the regular lattices under consideration .",
    "implicit summations over repeated indices are also assumed . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , the spin - correlation coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) are to be determined by a set of ccm nonlinear equations : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hermitian conjugate of the corresponding multi - spin correlation string @xmath46 .    in practice",
    "we clearly need an approximation scheme to truncate the expansion of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) to some finite or infinite subset of the full set of multi - spin configurations @xmath47 .",
    "the three most commonly used truncation methods up till now are : ( 1 ) the sub@xmath48 scheme , in which all correlations involving only @xmath48 or fewer spins are retained , however far separated on the lattice ; ( 2 ) the simpler sub@xmath48-@xmath49 sub - approximation , where only sub@xmath48 correlations spanning a range of no more than @xmath49 adjacent lattice sites are retained ; and ( 3 ) the systematic local lsub@xmath49 scheme , which includes all multi - spin correlations over all possible distinct locales on the lattice defined by @xmath49 or fewer contiguous sites .",
    "only the last approximation scheme will be adopted throughout this article .",
    "the first step in the practical implementation of the lsub@xmath49 ccm is to enumerate all of the distinct multi - spin configurations or correlated clusters , which we shall henceforth call _ fundamental _ configurations , @xmath50 with @xmath51 , retained in the lsub@xmath49 approximation .",
    "it should be noted that the multi - spin configurations that are related by hamiltonian symmetries , translational and rotational alike , are counted as one single distinct configuration .",
    "such a correlated cluster can be either a connected cluster of size @xmath49 ( also called a `` lattice animal '' or `` polyomino '' ) or a subset of it ( connected or disconnected ) . although the asymptotic behaviour of the number of lattice animals on a regular lattice remains an open combinatorial question , efficient algorithms for enumerating lattice animals up to sizes of about @xmath52 have been developed in various fields including percolation and cell growth problems@xcite .",
    "the second step in our modular implementation , namely , generating the corresponding set of ccm equations , is what we will focus on in the remainder of this section .",
    "equation ( [ eq12 ] ) reveals that there are essentially two computational aspects involved in obtaining all possible non - zero contributions to its right - hand side .",
    "the first is to calculate the similarity - transformed hamiltonian which then acts on the model state , and the second is to select terms of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian that match exactly the string of spin - lowering operators represented by the set of site indices @xmath53 .",
    "the first aspect is intrinsically related to the noncommutative nature of quantum spin operators , and the second to the geometric considerations of the lattice on which the hamiltonian is defined .",
    "we address these two aspects in more detail below .",
    "the computation of the similarity - transformed hamiltonian , @xmath54 , which acts on the model state @xmath13 can be performed straightforwardly by making use of the relations @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the goal here is to completely eliminate @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and thus retain the creation operators only , by utilising the commutation relations of the spin operators , namely , @xmath59=\\pm s^{\\pm}$ ] and @xmath60=-2s^z$ ] .",
    "this greatly simplifies the matching problem in generating the ccm equations as discussed below . to this end",
    ", we note that the similarity - transformed single - spin operators can be expressed as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 s^+_{i_1}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot s^+_{i_{l-1}}$ ] .",
    "furthermore , the commutation relations between the spin operators and the @xmath63 operators can also be written in the following compact forms , @xmath64 where @xmath65 s^+_{i_1 } \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot s^+_{i_{l-2}}$ ] .",
    "unlike in previous equations , repeated indices in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) _ do not _ imply summations .",
    "clearly both @xmath66 and @xmath67 operators contain creation operators only .",
    "consider then a typical two - spin interaction term , @xmath68 , for example , as contained in most spin - lattice hamiltonians ( see sec .",
    "iii and iv for a full description of the quantum spin hamiltonians actually studied in this article ) .",
    "it is easy to prove the following relation : @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , the resulting terms from @xmath70 are classified into three categories as explicitly containing both @xmath71 and @xmath72 , either @xmath71 or @xmath72 , and neither @xmath71 nor @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the reason for such a classification will become clear when we consider the second aspect , namely , generating the ccm equations . thus , the first case is the simplest of all three to deal with , since the site indices of all terms in the case , including both @xmath73 and @xmath49 , are completely fixed up to permutations by the _ target _ set @xmath74 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "although , unlike in the first case , only one of @xmath73 and @xmath49 in the second case must lie within the set @xmath74 , the search for @xmath73 or @xmath49 in the matching problem can be easily performed once @xmath49 or @xmath73 is fixed .",
    "this comes about since the two - spin interactions with which we mostly deal are usually short - ranged .",
    "typical examples are the nearest - neighbour interactions where @xmath73 and @xmath49 are simply the nearest neighbours as in the two models considered in this article . by contrast",
    ", neither index @xmath73 nor index @xmath49 in the last case must belong to the set @xmath74 .",
    "nonetheless , for the lsub@xmath49 approximation scheme used here , both @xmath73 and @xmath49 must lie within a _",
    "finite _ set of indices for which @xmath74 is a subset .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider the term in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , @xmath75 , which can be written explicitly as : @xmath76   [ m n_1 \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot n_{l_2 } ]         s^+_{i_1 } \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot s^+_{i_{l_1 } }   s^+_{n_1 } \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot s^+_{n_{l_2 } }   \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] where summation over repeated indices is implicitly assumed . therefore ,",
    "generating the part of the ccm equations due to this particular term @xmath75 amounts to determining all possible non - zero contributions to @xmath77 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "this is achieved by partitioning the target set @xmath74 into two subsets @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 , followed by a search for the appropriate @xmath73 and @xmath49 in a _ nearby _ region that includes @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , such that both correlation coefficients @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath82 $ ] are the ( symmetry - related ) fundamental configurations of a given lsub@xmath49 approximation .",
    "unlike earlier work@xcite where the maximum number of fundamental configurations is limited to @xmath83 or so , the present approach based on partition completely eliminates the costly procedure implemented previously for avoiding double occupancies of spin-@xmath35 objects , and thus reduces the cpu usage a great deal .",
    "this optimal implementation becomes possible because all of the terms ( e.g. , @xmath75 ) in the similarity - transformed hamiltonian ( @xmath84 ) and , more importantly , their explicit structures are completely specified by the _ seemingly tedious _",
    "reformulation of @xmath84 in terms of @xmath63 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 operators .",
    "the ccm ket - state equations so obtained can then be solved by the standard newton - raphson method .      according to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) in sec .",
    "iia , it is necessary to obtain both the ket - state correlation coefficients @xmath87 and the bra - state correlation coefficients @xmath88 in order to compute a general ground - state physical quantity such as the sublattice magnetisation .",
    "the task of generating the bra - state ccm equations ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ) turns out to be simple .",
    "firstly , note that this set of coupled equations is linear in @xmath89 , as is evident in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ; secondly , a simple equality , @xmath90 , demonstrates that the bra - state equations can be readily generated from the already obtained ccm ket - state equations by appropriate differentiations .",
    "similarly , in the context of spin-@xmath36 quantum antiferromagnets , the @xmath91 operator is in general decomposed entirely in terms of annihilation operators which are again defined with respect to local quantisation axes : @xmath92 } s^-_{i_1 } + \\widetilde { [ i_1 i_2 ] }    s^-_{i_1 } s^-_{i_2}+ \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\;\\ ; ,   \\label{eq17}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 } , \\widetilde { [ i_1 i_2 ] } $ ] and so on denote the corresponding bra - state spin - correlation coefficients ( recall @xmath87 in sec .",
    "iia ) specified by the sets of site indices @xmath42 , @xmath43 and so on , which is the analogue of eq . ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the same lsub@xmath49 truncation scheme is also adopted .",
    "this means that there exists a one - to - one mapping between the ket - state and the bra - state fundamental correlation coefficients which , to ease the burden of notation , are now denoted as @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "now let @xmath96 denote the @xmath97 ket - state ccm equation , which is given in terms of the ket - state correlation coefficients and @xmath98 , which stands for other parameters included in the hamiltonian such as anisotropy , for example .",
    "consequently @xmath99 may now be written in terms of @xmath100 and the bra - state correlation coefficients , @xmath101 as : @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the zeroth - order ccm term , i.e. , the ground - state energy expression , and @xmath104 is the number of fundamental configurations retained for a given lsub@xmath49 approximation level .",
    "therefore , the @xmath105 bra - state equation may now be rewritten in terms of @xmath106 and @xmath100 : @xmath107 these linear equations may now be solved by using a standard decomposition technique for linearly dependent equations , such as the lu decomposition method , once the ket - state correlation coefficients @xmath94 are known .    equipped with the above ccm algorithms , which are readily implemented for spin-@xmath35 quantum magnets , we report our new findings on ground - state properties of both the square- and triangular - lattice spin-@xmath35 quantum antiferromagnets in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively , in order to illustrate the relative simplicity of the present approach .",
    "similar algorithms have also been successfully implemented to study the excitation spectra",
    ". this will be the subject of a future publication@xcite .",

    "the square lattice model has no exact solution , unlike its 1d counterpart , although approximate analytical and numerical calculations have been performed . to put later ccm calculations in context",
    ", we note that the model has three regimes : an ising - like phase characterised by non - zero order ; a planar - like phase in which the spins in the ground - state wavefunction are believed to lie in the @xmath110 plane ; and a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "a monte carlo study of the 2d anisotropic heisenberg model was performed by barnes _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "they observed that the staggered magnetisation in the @xmath111-direction is non - zero for @xmath112 , but then appears to become zero below @xmath113 .",
    "they therefore conclude that the critical point is probably very near to this point .",
    "in contrast to this monte carlo calculation , kubo and kishi@xcite have used sum rules to investigate the ground state of this system .",
    "they state that the ground state possesses an off - diagonal long - range order ( lro ) akin to that of the _ xy_-like state at small anisotropy , @xmath114 .",
    "also , for @xmath115 they observe that the system demonstrates non - zero ising - like lro . at @xmath116",
    "there is a first - order phase transition to the ferromagnetic phase for this model .",
    "the isotropic heisenberg point has been extensively studied using various approximate methods , and so shall be used as a test case for the ccm results discussed later in this section .",
    "runge@xcite has performed the most accurate monte carlo simulation to date .",

    "we begin the ccm treatment of this spin system by choosing a suitable model state @xmath13 ( for a particular regime ) , such that all other possible spin configurations may be obtained by the application of linear combinations of products of spin - raising operators to this state . in the ising - like",

    "[ fig6 ] , the lsub@xmath49 ground - state energy curve for @xmath198 terminates at lower and upper critical values of the anisotropy , @xmath199 and @xmath200 respectively , beyond which no physical solution of the ccm ket - state equations exists .",

    "iib , we search over a wide area in order to determine the ` free ' indices within specific terms in @xmath145 . in 1d , we find that this area depends on @xmath49 linearly , but in 2d , for example , this area increases quadratically with @xmath49 .",
    "we need to perform this search because , as yet , we do not take into account the manner in which the members of the set of fundamental configurations are inter - related .",
    "for example , some configurations are related to others by the addition or subtraction of a single spin .",
    "thus , most of the processing time is spent sweeping through this area regardless of whether we know that a particular configuration will contribute or not .",
    "a useful gain could be to determine the way in which the configurations are related , using graph theory@xcite for example , and then to use this knowledge in order to reduce the search area .",

    "ccm expansions of the ground - state energy have also been performed up to sixtieth order , at a fraction of the computational cost compared to a direct calculation of the exact series to this order . a possible way of overcoming the memory and disk space limit , when finding the ccm equations , is to derive a perturbative solution to the ccm equations ( as previously discussed in sec .",
    "we obtain the expansion coefficients of the ket - state correlation coefficients in terms of powers of some coupling parameter . as shown in table [ t2 ] , we may then substitute the series expansions for the ket - state correlation coefficients into the ground - state energy equation , thus forming a power series for this quantity in powers of the coupling parameter . the prospective gain",
    "is that we might use less disk space in evaluating and storing the series coefficients than in storing the ccm equations .",
    "however , each ccm equation must be evaluated many times in order to determine the power series , which in turn means that we must significantly increase the speed of our code .",
    "we note that the number of configurations that is needed in order to reproduce exact @xmath211-order perturbation theory is a small fraction of the total number of configurations .",
    "hence , if one can state beforehand which configurations are necessary in order to reproduce @xmath211-order perturbation theory , an elegant method of reducing the processing time and memory overheads might be to use this small fraction instead of the total number of configurations .",
    "another exciting prospect in order to increase the speed might be to generate the ccm equations _ in parallel_. also , the ccm is well suited to parallelisation as each ccm equation could be implemented on a separate processor .",
    "note that the evaluation of each equation depends only on the target configuration and the form of the hamiltonian , which remains constant .",
    "the possible weaknesses of this approach are that one is limited not only by the number of nodes in the system , but more importantly also by the `` weakest link '' . by this we mean",
    "that one can only progress as fast as the evaluation of the slowest equation at each iteration .",
    "however , very large gains are possible by sharing out the processing needs .    to recap",
    ", we have mentioned that our results using the new ccm formalism are now fully competitive with qmc results , and we have seen that our approach is easily generalisable to other systems .",
    "possible future systems to which we may apply the new formalism include the valence - bond solids@xcite , systems with higher spin@xcite , and models with electronic degrees of freedom such as the hubbard model@xcite . the nature of the ground states of new and interesting materials or spin models might be quickly and easily investigated by specifying the hamiltonian , lattice and spin number , and development of the code might therefore lead to a powerful test - bench for various new ideas .",
    "the future also holds the possibility of very high - order calculations , which will increase our knowledge both of these systems and also of the ccm . with the inclusion of very high orders of approximation",
    "it is also hoped that the asymptotic nature of the ccm ground - state energies , sublattice magnetisations and phase transitions will become clear . in conclusion",
    ", we believe that the application of the ccm to the lattice spin systems is yielding excellent and interesting results , though there are still many avenues of fruitful and challenging research to be investigated .",
