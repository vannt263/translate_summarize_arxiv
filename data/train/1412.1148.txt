    "theoretical work has shown that `` feedback '' from an agn can limit galaxy masses and luminosities by suppressing star formation , either through a powerful wind that clears the interstellar medium from the host galaxy ( quasar - mode ) , or through the production of jets of relativistic particles that prevent gas in the hot halo from cooling ( radio - mode ) ( e.g. , ostriker & cowie 1981 ; silk & rees 1998 ; granato et al .",

    "we now use the larger combined cdf - n+cdf - s x - ray sample to investigate the relative strengths of the fir and mir components of the x - ray sources on an individual basis . in figure",
    "[ radpowercdfs_lmir ] , we plot gray body luminosity versus mir luminosity for our @xmath126 radio sample that are not also in the x - ray sample ( blue dots ) .",
    "we also show the linear relation obtained from these points ( blue line ) .",
    "we can see that the radio sources follow the relation tightly , confirming the existence of a mir - radio correlation in star formation dominated galaxies .",
    "we also show on the figure the combined cdf - n and cdf - s x - ray sample at @xmath126 that have ( a ) @xmath127  erg  s@xmath10 and ( b ) @xmath128  erg  s@xmath10 ( colored squares ) . while most of the x - ray less luminous sources follow the correlation , suggesting that these sources have significant fir emission due to star formation in the host galaxies , most of the x - ray quasars have gray body luminosities that are low compared to the correlation , as would be expected if there was little star formation .",
    "( note that the mir luminosities stay high in the x - ray quasars due to the agn contribution . )",
    "we again wish to check that such a luminosity - luminosity plot constructed from flux - limited samples is not producing apparent correlations that are not real .",
    "thus , in figure  [ mirfir - rat ] , we show the ratio of gray body luminosity to mir luminosity versus x - ray luminosity for the x - ray sources with @xmath129  erg  s@xmath10  hz@xmath10 .",
    "we also plot in histogram form ( blue ) the distribution of the radio sample ( using the same radio power threshold ) that are not also in the x - ray sample and their mean value ( blue horizontal line ) .",
    "0.5 cm        0.5 cm        we see an abrupt drop in the gray body to mir luminosity ratios for the most x - ray luminous sources , with the transition x - ray luminosity lying slightly above the x - ray quasar definition ( red vertical line ) .",
    "in contrast , the ratios for the x - ray less luminous sources remain relatively constant ( also apparent in the blue histogram showing the radio sample ) .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that there is little star formation taking place in the hosts of x - ray luminous agns , confirming what we saw schematically in figure  [ stack_sed_lx ] .",
    "the above results alternatively could be ascribed to the superpositions of star - forming galaxy seds and varying agn seds .",
    "however , we suspect that this might lead to a less abrupt evolution of the gray body to mir luminosity ratios to high x - ray luminosities .    -0.8",
    "cm    -0.5 cm        -1.25 cm",
    "we finally turn to the distribution of gray body luminosities , @xmath130 , as a function of @xmath12 . in figure  [ histdist](a ) , we show this distribution for the @xmath131 sources in the cdf - n and cdf - s fields , divided into two intervals of @xmath132 : @xmath133 and @xmath134  erg  s@xmath10 .    in order to include the cosmos field , we also computed a simpler set of luminosities , @xmath135 , which are based on the arp  220 sed and only the measured submillimeter flux and redshift instead of on the combined fir gray body and mir power law fits . in figure  [ histdist](b ) , we show this luminosity distribution for the same redshift and @xmath132 intervals as in figure  [ histdist](a ) .",
    "the larger uncertainties in these luminosities cause a larger spread in the distributions , but we now have high enough numbers to run a two tailed mann - whitney test . we find only a 0.026 probability that the two distributions are consistent with one another , which is similar to our earlier results .",
    "we also show on the figures the expected distributions based on the mean errors if there were no signal in the sources ( black curves ) .",
    "while the @xmath136  erg  s@xmath10 source distribution is consistent with no signal , the @xmath137  erg  s@xmath10 source distribution is offset due to signal .    in figure  [ histdist](a ) , the mean values of the histograms ( green dashed vertical lines ) are @xmath138  erg  s@xmath10 for the low @xmath12 interval and @xmath139  erg  s@xmath10 for the high @xmath12 interval , which would place the hosts in the near - ulirg category ( a ulirg corresponds to @xmath140  erg  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "however , as can be seen from all the components of figure  [ histdist ] , the distributions are highly skewed , resulting in the mean values being dominated by a small number of high - luminosity galaxies . in the blue upper histogram of figure  [ histdist](a ) , just 6 out of 67 galaxies contain half the light and dominate the determination of the mean .",
    "thus , simple stacking or averaging analyses can not adequately describe the behavior of the bulk of the galaxies .",
    "0.25 cm     0.5 cm     the skewness of the distributions could suggest that the duty cycle for the optically luminous phase of the host galaxies is only about 10% of the duty cycle of the agn themselves , with galaxies mostly being quiescent when the agn is luminous with occasional strong starburst episodes .",
    "we may use the median instead to represent more properly the behavior of the typical galaxy . in figure  [ histdist](a ) , we find median luminosities ( black vertical lines ) of @xmath141  erg  s@xmath10 for the low @xmath12 interval and @xmath142  erg  s@xmath10 for the high @xmath12 interval . here",
    "the errors are the 68% confidence range .",
    "these median values show that the typical hosts of the low @xmath12 interval sources lie in the lirg range ( a lirg corresponds to @xmath143  erg  s@xmath10 ) , while the typical hosts of the high @xmath12 interval sources lie in the sub - lirg range .",
    "only a very small number of x - ray sources lie in very luminous ( ulirg or greater ) hosts .",
    "in this paper , we examined the amount of dusty star formation taking place in the host galaxies of a @xmath2  kev agn sample in the cdf - n and cdf - s fields using ultradeep 850  @xmath0 m scuba-2 images of both fields and an extremely deep 1.4  ghz vla image of the cdf - n . supplementing this sample with a brighter x - ray sample in the cosmos field with scuba-2 data , we first measured the submillimeter fluxes of the x - ray sources with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "we found a dependence of 850  @xmath0 m flux on x - ray luminosity , with the error - weighted means peaking at @xmath93  erg  s@xmath10 before dropping by @xmath70 to @xmath144  erg  s@xmath10 , and by an even larger amount to @xmath145  erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "monte carlo simulations give only a 0.013 probability that the 850  @xmath0 m fluxes drawn from the @xmath71  erg  s@xmath10 population are as large as those drawn from the @xmath73  erg  s@xmath10 population .",
    "assuming the fir light is produced mostly by star formation , we interpreted this result as an initial rise in the host galaxy sfrs with increasing x - ray luminosity followed by a drop in the sfrs to the highest x - ray luminosities .    substantially more information is contained in the full seds of the x - ray sources .",
    "given the extensive multiwavelength data available , including from _ herschel _ , we constructed average seds for our x - ray sample to show schematically the observed dependence on x - ray luminosity .",
    "we chose three redshift ranges ( @xmath87 ; @xmath146 ; and @xmath147 ) and four x - ray luminosity intervals ( @xmath148  erg  s@xmath10 ; @xmath149 ; @xmath85 ; @xmath150 ) .",
    "we saw that the fir luminosities of the host galaxies rose with increasing redshift .",
    "however , within each redshift range , the average sed of the highest x - ray luminosity interval was cut off at long wavelengths .",
    "this reinforces the idea that the sfrs in the host galaxies of the most x - ray luminous sources at any redshift are too low to produce a substantial fir luminosity ; however , to analyze this effect statistically , we need to fit the individual source seds .",
    "we performed individual sed fits on both the x - ray and radio sources using a 5 parameter combined fir gray body plus truncated mir power law fit .",
    "we used the resulting gray body and mir luminosities in the cdf - n to confirm the fir - radio and mir - radio correlations for the @xmath151 radio sources that are not also in the x - ray sample .",
    "we then looked to see whether the @xmath126 x - ray sample in the cdf - n obeyed the fir - radio correlation .",
    "we found that most of the x - ray quasars ( @xmath152  ergs  s@xmath10 ) did not , while most of the x - ray less luminous agns did .",
    "thus , for the x - ray quasars , the radio power does not appear to be related to the star formation in the host galaxies , while for the x - ray less luminous agns , the radio power appears to be dominated by the star formation .",
    "this suggests that x - ray luminosity is useful as a diagnostic for determining when radio power may be used to estimate sfrs .",
    "we next investigated the relative strengths of the fir and mir components of the x - ray sources .",
    "for the combined cdf - n and cdf - s @xmath126 x - ray sample , we found that the x - ray less luminous agns generally followed the fir - mir correlation , while most of the x - ray quasars lay below the correlation .",
    "we interpreted the fir luminosities as being low in the host galaxies of the x - ray quasars due to the lack of star formation , while the mir luminosities stayed high due to the agn contribution .",
    "finally , we analyzed the distribution of fir luminosities as a function of x - ray luminosity and found that the median represents the behavior of the typical galaxy better than the mean , which is skewed by a small number of sources ( @xmath153% of the sample ) .",
    "thus , stacking or averaging analyses overestimate the level of star formation taking place in the bulk of the x - ray sample , and analyses of individual sources , such as those presented in this paper , are needed .",
