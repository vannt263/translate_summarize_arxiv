    "let us show first that the finest model is non - degenerate .",
    "indeed , by the assumption @xmath0 has no siegel domains .",
    "if @xmath0 has a parattracting domain then by theorem  [ csgap ] the finest model is non - degenerate .",
    "it remains to consider the case when @xmath0 has no fatou domains ( i.e. , @xmath13 is non - separating ) and no cs - points . then by @xcite @xmath0 has infinitely many repelling periodic bi - accessible points .",
    "hence in this case the finest model is non - degenerate either .",
    "now , take any point @xmath45 of @xmath0 , consider the corresponding k - class @xmath812 and show that it is finite . indeed , suppose first that @xmath45 is non-(pre)periodic . then by theorem",
    "[ kiwi - wan ] the corresponding k - class is finite .",
    "now suppose that @xmath45 is ( pre)periodic ; we may assume that it is periodic of period @xmath93 .",
    "consider the set @xmath988 and show that it is non - separating . indeed",
    ", otherwise there is a parattracting domain @xmath142 contained in the topological hull @xmath989 ( since @xmath0 does not have cs - points it can not be a siegel domain ) .",
    "however by lemma  [ fatliv1 ] the boundary @xmath425 is not collapsed under @xmath2 , a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath68 is non - separating .",
    "let us show that then it must contain infinitely many repelling periodic bi - accessible points . indeed , suppose otherwise . then replacing @xmath0 by an appropriate power we may assume that all periodic points in @xmath68 and all the rays landing at them are invariant . by theorem  [ degimp ] this implies , that @xmath68 is a point , a contradiction to @xmath812 being infinite by the assumption ( at any repelling periodic point only finitely many rays land )",
    "so , if @xmath0 has no cs - points then there are no infinite k - classes which implies that k - equivalence in fact coincides with the lamination @xmath29 and thus produces the finest locally connected model of @xmath13 .",
    "let us compare our approach and results with those of @xcite .",
    "kiwi uses direct arguments to construct the finest model for polynomials without cs - points .",
    "he also relies more upon combinatorial and related to symbolic dynamics arguments .",
    "our approach , based upon continuum theory , is different .",
    "it allows us to show that kiwi s locally connected model of a connected julia set without cs - points is actually the _",
    "finest locally connected model of @xmath13 _ , the finest from the purely topological point of view .",
    "it also allows us to extend kiwi s results @xcite onto _ all _ polynomials with connected julia sets .",
    "however we only tackle the case of connected julia sets while in @xcite disconnected julia sets are also considered .    to conclude the paper we want to specify k",
    "- equivalence a little more .",
    "namely , in the next theorem we obtain additional information about the way impressions of angles from finite k - classes can intersect .",
    "the theorem holds regardless of whether a polynomial has cs - points or not .",
    "however in the case when @xmath0 has no cs - points it applies to _ all _ k - classes .",
    "[ ptn ] suppose that @xmath990 is a finite k - class .",
    "then impressions of angles of @xmath48 which are adjacent on the circle meet . moreover , any subset of @xmath48 in which _ only _ adjacent angles have meeting impressions consists of no more than 3 elements .    in the case when @xmath48 is a ( pre)periodic k - class ( equivalently , @xmath29-class ) it follows from lemma  [ lcpt ] that @xmath83 is a point which implies the conclusions of the lemma . also , if @xmath48 consists of two angles the conclusions of the lemma are obvious .",
    "hence the remaining case is when @xmath991 and @xmath48 is a wandering polygon .",
    "consider this case by way of contradiction .",
    "assume that @xmath992 circularly ordered and @xmath993 .",
    "denote the open arc between @xmath994 which is complementary to @xmath48 by @xmath229 .",
    "let us show that there exists a fatou domain @xmath142 and a point of @xmath995\\cap { \\mathrm{bd}}(u)$ ] . draw a curve @xmath51 which starts at a point of a ray of an angle from @xmath229 and ends at a point of a ray of an angle from @xmath996 .",
    "clearly , @xmath51 separates @xmath997 from @xmath998 .",
    "since @xmath83 is a continuum , @xmath51 will have to intersect @xmath83 .",
    "denote by @xmath59 the first on @xmath51 point of intersection between @xmath51 and @xmath83 .",
    "let us show that a sufficiently small open subarc @xmath206 of @xmath51 with one endpoint @xmath59 and disjoint from @xmath83 is in fact disjoint from @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath645 and @xmath999 are adjacent elements of @xmath48 , the set @xmath1000 is disjoint from @xmath83 , and hence does not contain @xmath59 . on the other hand , @xmath1001 by the choice of @xmath51 .",
    "hence @xmath1002 , and since @xmath68 is compact , we can find the desired arc @xmath206 .",
    "on the other hand , the intersection @xmath1003 is disconnected which implies that @xmath68 separates the plane . by the construction @xmath206",
    "must be contained in a bounded component @xmath142 of @xmath67 . since @xmath1004",
    ", it follows that @xmath142 is a fatou domain , and hence @xmath1005 .",
    "take a small ball @xmath60 centered at @xmath59 .",
    "by @xcite there exists a ( pre)periodic point @xmath1006 . also , choose a ( pre)periodic point @xmath1007 so that a ray of an angle belonging to @xmath229 lands at @xmath888 . since @xmath83 is wandering , @xmath1008 .",
    "as in the proof of lemma  [ fatliv1 ] , connect a point @xmath1009 with infinity by a curve @xmath790 which intersects @xmath13 only at @xmath177 and @xmath1010",
    ". then @xmath1011 separates @xmath997 from @xmath998 on the plane and is disjoint from the continuum @xmath83 which contains both @xmath997 and @xmath1012 , a contradiction .",
    "thus , adjacent angles in @xmath48 must have non - disjoint impressions .    to prove the rest , assume that there exist angles",
    "@xmath1013 which are circularly ordered and such that all adjacent angles have non - disjoint impressions while otherwise the impressions of angles are disjoint .",
    "consider two continua , @xmath1014 and @xmath1015 .",
    "then it follows that      which is disconnected because @xmath1017 ( recall that @xmath1018 ) . hence @xmath83 separates the plane which is impossible .",
    "indeed , if @xmath83 separates the plane then its topological hull contains a fatou domain and @xmath83 is ( pre)periodic .",
    "assume that @xmath83 ( and @xmath48 ) are periodic of period @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath83 contains the boundary of an parattracting fatou domain then by @xcite @xmath83 will have to intersect infinitely many impressions , a contradiction .",
    "if @xmath83 contains the boundary of a siegel domain then by lemma  [ hedgehog ] it contains a critical point @xmath1019 and @xmath48 contains at least two angles with the same @xmath157-image .",
    "however , as @xmath48 is a finite invariant k - class , the map @xmath157 maps @xmath48 onto itself in a one - to - one fashion , a contradiction ."
