    "it has been proposed that the damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) systems seen as broad absorption lines with neutral hydrogen column density @xmath1 2 10@xmath2 @xmath3 in quasar spectra are large and massive ( milky way sized ) , galactic disks with maximum circular speed @xmath4 200 km / s ( e.g. , prochaska & wolfe 1997 , 1998 ) . if true , this is of profound interest in relation to theories of the formation and evolution of disk galaxies , but it is obviously important to test this hypothesis in as many ways as possible . in this contribution",
    "i present a test alternative to the ones used by prochasca & wolfe .",
    "my test is based on fairly elaborate and realistic models of the formation and evolution ( including chemical evolution ) of large and massive disk galaxies , in particular on comparing the observed distribution of zinc abundance with neutral hydrogen column density found for dlas with model predictions .    in section 2",
    "i briefly describe the models , in section 3 the data , in section 4 the model predictions are confronted with the data and finally section 5 constitutes a brief conclusion .",
    "the star - formation rate is assumed to depend on gas surface density as @xmath5 where n=1 - 2 , and the weight factor @xmath6 for models without a star - formation threshold and @xmath7 for models with a star - formation threshold given by ( e.g. , kennicutt 1989 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the epicyclic frequency @xmath10 @xmath11 is the velocity dispersion of the gas , @xmath0 is a dimensionless constant of the order unity and @xmath12 is the epicyclic frequency at the solar distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "i have adopted @xmath0 = 0.7 and @xmath11 = 6 km / s ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "infall of primordial gas , but no gas out - flows are included in these models of large and massive disk galaxies .",
    "chemical evolution is calculated assuming a scalo ( 1986 ) initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "oxygen is assumed to be produced in massive stars only ( @xmath13 8 m@xmath14 ) and instantaneously recycled by type ii supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "iron is assumed to be produced partly by massive stars ( @xmath13 8 m@xmath14 ) and instantaneously recycled by type ii sn explosions and partly by less massive stars and recycled by type ia sn explosions with a time - delay of @xmath15 = 1 gyr .",
    "unprocessed gas , locked up in stars , is assumed to be non - instantaneously recycled .",
    "the proportionality constants in the star - formation laws ( eq . [ 1 ] ) are determined by applying eq . [ 1 ] to the local , solar cylinder and fitting data on the local gas fraction , g - dwarf distribution etc .",
    "the global properties of the large disks as a function of time ( or redshift ) are determined by assuming that an average , spin - parameter @xmath16 = 0.05 , galactic disk of either early or late type ( see below ) has an exponentially decreasing stellar profile with radius @xmath17 in the disk ( e.g. , freeman 1970 ) truncated at 4 stellar scale - lengths ( e.g. , van der kruit 1987 ) and an exponentially decreasing oxygen gas abundance profile with radius in the disk ( e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "1994 , garnett et al .",
    "early type disk galaxies ( sab / sbc ) are assumed to have an average star - formation history parameter @xmath18 , defined as the ratio of the current to the past average star - formation rate , of @xmath19 0.33 and late type disks ( scd / sdm ) to have an average @xmath19 1.0 ( kennicutt et al .",
    "an ellis ( 1983 ) present day ( @xmath20=0 ) morphological mix of e / s0:sab / sbc : scd / sdm = 0.28:0.47:0.25 is assumed and the models are averaged over spin - parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the models thereby cover the full range of morphology and global surface brightness of large , galactic disks and are fully constrained : there are no free parameters left , except for the star - formation law index @xmath21 and the absence or presence of a star - formation threshold and the conclusions reached in this work turn out to be quite insensitive to this for reasonable values of @xmath21 ( @xmath21=1 - 2 ) - see also below .",
    "observational data on 34 dla systems ( including zinc abundances or limits ) have been taken from pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "zinc is used because it is not or only very slightly affected by dust depletion .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath22 $ ] versus neutral hydrogen gas column densities @xmath23 for the 18 dlas with zinc detected .",
    "they have a mean redshift of @xmath24=1.91 .",
    "interestingly , higher zinc abundance corresponds to _ lower _",
    "@xmath23 , which is _ not _ to be expected if the dlas are large , galactic disks , even when effects of dust obscuration of quasars are taken into account - see below .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath22 $ ] versus @xmath23 for the 16 dlas with upper limits on the zinc abundance .",
    "the mean redshift of these is @xmath24=2.56 .",
    "figure 3 shows the model predicted @xmath25 $ ] distributions for @xmath23 = 2 - 10 10@xmath2    @xmath3 and @xmath23 = 10 - 50 10@xmath2 @xmath3 for the no star - formation threshold models with star - formation law index @xmath21=1.5 .",
    "the distributions have been weighted over morphological mix , spin - parameter ( and hence effectively global surface brightness ) and projected area and corrected for the effects of dust obscuration of quasars using the clever methodology developed by fall & pei ( 1993 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the same thing , but for the models _ with _    a star - formation threshold ( and still @xmath21=1.5 ) .",
    "neither of the two sets of model distributions appear to match the data at all ( assuming that @xmath22 \\simeq [ fe / h]$ ] as is the case for galactic stars of all abundances ) .",
    "more quantitatively , komolgorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests show that both sets of model distributions can be ruled out as fits to the data with more than 99% confidence ( this result is more generally obtained for all values @xmath21=1 - 2 and also for wyse & silk ( 1989 ) type star - formation laws ) .",
    "the mismatch between the data and the models is further illustrated by figure 5 .",
    "the figure shows the number of predicted dla systems per redshift    interval with zinc detected , @xmath26 , for @xmath23 = 2 - 10 10@xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath27 10@xmath28 @xmath3 versus redshift @xmath20 .",
    "the models have been normalized using observational information about the luminosity function and sizes of present day ( @xmath20=0 ) , large and massive disk galaxies ( with @xmath4 200 km / s ) .",
    "the model predictions have been weighted and corrected as described above and furthermore corrected for the effect of a zinc detection threshold as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "figure 5 is for the models with star - formation law index @xmath21=1.5 and no star - formation threshold .",
    "also shown are apm survey based observational results of storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) corrected by an observationally deduced zinc detection probability as a function of redshift @xmath20 and @xmath23 derived from the pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) data .",
    "as can be seen from the figures the two sets of model predictions lie more than two orders of magnitude below the observations - the situation is even worse for the models _ with _ a star - formation threshold ( not shown ) .",
    "the analysis presented above suggests that the dla systems may not in general be accounted for by large and massive disk galaxies with @xmath4 200 km / s , not even when account is taken for the existence of some very large and low surface brightness disk galaxies ( physically : high @xmath16 galactic disks ) .",
    "the true situation is most likely quite complicated , but it is tempting to associate the dlas at low redshift with the large population of faint , blue dwarfs and at higher redshift with the large number of smaller galaxies expected at such redshifts ( @xmath29 2 - 4 ) in hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 , mo et al .",
    "dlas with indications of large internal velocities ( @xmath30 200 km / s ) may , at least partly , be dynamically unrelaxed systems ( e.g. , haehnelt et al .",
    "i have benefited from discussions with mike edmunds , don garnett , bernard jones , bernard pagel and max pettini ."
