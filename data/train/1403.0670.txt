    "there is accumulating evidence showing that the evolution of host galaxies is tightly related to their central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) @xcite .",
    "the most linkages are the strong correlations between the mass of smbh and properties of the galactic spheroid , including luminosity @xcite , stellar velocity dispersion @xcite and stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the general consensus is that powerful feedback from the central active galactic nuclei ( agns ) should play an important role in the formation and evolution processes of their host galaxies .",
    "simple energetic arguments indicate that agns should be capable of heating the inner regions of galaxies to offset radiative cooling and further regulate the black hole growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many authors have proposed and performed successful theoretical models and numerical simulations to investigate how the feedback plays the role . however , because the length scales associated with agn activity are so tiny compared to their host galaxy , the feedback process must operate over a huge dynamical range .",
    "this implies that the detailed agn feedback mechanisms must be diverse and explains why this process is still incompletely understood ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",

    "to study agn feedback , ideally , we should cover the whole range of lengths and timescales , from black hole event horizon to the galactic scales .",
    "obviously , such a huge dynamical range is technically almost impossible to achieve by current 2- and 3-dimensional numerical simulations . in reality ,",
    "different works focus on feedback at different scales . at the smallest black hole accretion scale ,",
    "works have been done on outflow production driven by line force ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and on the radiative feedback due to the global compton scattering @xcite .",
    "the latter effect has been invoked to explain the intermittent behavior of the black hole activity of some compact young radio sources @xcite . on the other hand , many works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have focused on the much larger galactic scale , from @xmath1 pc to tens of kpc and the timescale from a fraction of myr to several gyr .",
    "brighenti & mathews ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , see also @xcite @xcite ) investigated the agn heating on the ism in details , and found that the thermal feedback could break the cool - core structures which are observed in many clusters , i.e. , the over - heating problem .",
    "gaspari et al .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) performed detailed simulations on the mechanical feedback , and they found that the mechanical feedback is favoured to solve the cooling flow problem , to explain to cold rims , and meantime to avoid over - heating .",
    "many works on the agn feedback have been done in the context of isolated elliptical galaxies by ciotti , ostriker and their collaborators , both in one dimension @xcite and two dimensions @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the inner boundary is small enough to resolve the black hole accretion flow , typically a few pc .",
    "this is important since it can compile the accretion rate in a physical way , which is crucial to evaluate the effect of agn feedback @xcite .",
    "when the bondi radius @xcite is not resolved , other more approximate methods of estimating the accretion rate ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must be utilized .",
    "the outer boundary is large enough to reach hundreds of kpc , i.e , the galactic outskirts .",
    "the timescale also covers a large range , from accretion timescale to galaxy evolution timescale .",
    "the interaction of the radiation and winds from the inner agns with the galactic gas and their effects on regulating the accretion are considered , together with physical processes such as supernovae heating and star formation .",
    "overall , the above mentioned works evidenced that the most satisfactory models are the combined models with both mechanical feedback and radiative feedback , in which mechanical feedback is very efficient to regulate the black hole growth , and radiative feedback can help to balance cooling and modulate the gas dynamics on the galactic scale .",
    "as is well - known , two `` modes '' of agn feedback have been identified @xcite .",
    "when the mass accretion rate is relatively large , @xmath2 ( where the eddington rate is defined as @xmath3 ) , we have the radiative or quasar mode . in this regime ,",
    "a standard thin disk is operating in the central region of agns , the luminosity is high , and a strong wind is observed ( see @xcite @xcite for a review ) . when the accretion rate is lower ,",
    "the agn is said to be in the kinetic mode , also known as the `` radio '' or `` maintanence '' mode .",
    "this mode corresponds to low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) . in this regime",
    ", the accretion flow is expected to be in the hot phase ( narayan & yi @xcite , @xcite ; see yuan & narayan @xcite for a recent review of the theoretical aspects of this model and its various astrophysical applications ) .",
    "the spectrum from a hot accretion flow is quite different from that of a standard thin disk , as we will describe in more detail in  [ sec : radio - mode - feedback ] .",
    "moreover , recent theoretical studies indicate that , in addition to jet , winds also exist in hot accretion flows @xcite .",
    "observationally , such a theoretical prediction has been confirmed by the chandra observation to the accretion flow around the supermassive black hole in our galactic center @xcite .",
    "the importance of radiative feedback in the quasar mode is obvious and well recognized .",
    "however , in the radio mode , the role of radiation is usually assumed to be minor compared to mechanical feedback by winds or jet .",
    "the reasons are possibly twofold .",
    "first , it is usually thought that the radiative power is low compared to the kinetic power of jet .",
    "second , the efficiency of radiative heating of the emitted radiation on the interstellar medium is assumed to be not high . however , the radiative luminosity may actually be larger than the kinetic outflow power for luminosities @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , regarding the radiative heating efficiency , it depends not only on the bolometric luminosity , but also the spectral energy distribution . taking the compton heating as an example ,",
    "the compton heating is proportional to both the total radiative flux and the compton temperature @xmath5 ( defined as the effective temperature of the radiation field , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the value of @xmath5 is determined by the spectral energy distribution ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : compton - temperature ] ) : in the quasar mode , typically @xmath6k @xcite , while in the radio mode , as we will describe in detail in  [ sec : radio - mode - feedback ] , @xmath5 is likely to be as high as @xmath7k , which is about two orders of magnitude higher than that in the quasar mode @xcite .",
    "such a difference of @xmath5 in the two feedback modes has not been considered in the works mentioned above ; rather , it is often assumed to maintain the same @xmath5 at different feedback modes .",
    "therefore , the radiative feedback in the radio mode could potentially be much more important than previous thought .",
    "for example , @xcite studied two models with different mechanical feedback efficiency @xmath8 . in the first class of models ( `` models a '' ) , @xmath8 is a constant . in another family",
    "( `` models b '' ) , the efficiency decreases with the decreasing luminosity .",
    "although there are some initial evidence that the assumption of model b leads to more realistic results , @xcite find that model b predicts too much growth of black hole mass , and incorrect agn duty cycle .",
    "will the results be changed when we correctly consider a stronger compton heating in the radio mode ?",
    "one of our main aims of the present work is to study the effect of a variable @xmath5 .    in the present paper ,",
    "following @xcite , we perform two - dimensional high resolution hydrodynamical numerical simulations to study the effect of agn feedback on the evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy . both mechanical and radiative interaction",
    "are considered .",
    "special attention is paid to the effect of radiative feedback .",
    "especially , the compton temperature is self - consistently determined from the different accretion modes and a high ( consistent ) @xmath5 is adopted when the accretion is in the hot mode .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we introduce the physics of our model , including how do we treat mechanical and radiative feedback , the galaxy model we adopt , and the numerical treatments of stellar mass loss , supernovae , and star formation .",
    "the setup and boundary conditions of numerical simulation are described in  3 .",
    "our results are presented in  4 , while  5 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this section we introduce the physics of our feedback model .",
    "many aspects of the simulations such as the galaxy model , the treatment of stellar evolution , and the hydrodynamical equations are the same as in @xcite ; for completeness , we briefly recall them .        in order to resolve the bondi radius",
    ", we carefully choose the inner boundary of our computational domain . yet , since the dynamics of accretion within the bondi radius ca nt be resolved , we still need to use a sub - grid model to describe the black - hole accretion onto the central agn . in order to guarantee accretion , in absence of explicit viscosity terms ,",
    "following @xcite , the specific angular momentum of the gas is assumed to be low . in this case , it is generally assumed that a small disk will be formed at a small circularization radius inside the bondi radius .    one important aspect to consider is the timescale for the gas at the inner boundary to fall onto the black hole .",
    "this is the sum of two timescales @xcite : ( 1 ) the free - fall timescale @xmath9 from the inner boundary to the circularization radius and ( 2 ) the accreting timescale @xmath10 at the circularization radius , which is determined by the viscous timescale of the small accretion disk . once the accretion timescale is known , it is possible to evaluate the mass accretion rate onto the black hole .",
    "first , we can calculate easily the mass inflow rate at the inner boundary of the simulation domain . as we described in  1",
    ", only a part of the gas can finally reach the black hole because of the mass outflow from the unresolved inner disk .",
    "we then need to subtract the mass outflow rate to get the net mass accretion rate @xmath11 at the black hole horizon and subsequently trace the black hole growth by updating the black hole mass at each time step .",
    "the instantaneous radiative luminosity of the agn is determined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radiative efficiency and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "if the accretion flow is described by a standard thin disk ( i.e , the agn is in the quasar mode ) , the efficiency is only a function of black hole spin and is independent of accretion rate @xmath15 .",
    "we adopt @xmath16 in the present work .",
    "when the accretion is in the hot accretion mode ( i.e. , the agn is in the radio mode ) , the value of @xmath13 becomes smaller and is a function of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite present the detailed study to this problem , and provide fitting formulae of @xmath13 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "however , in the present paper , in order to isolate the effect of a time - dependent compton temperature @xmath5 , we simply follow previous works and adopt the following recipe @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xcite @xcite , see also * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the efficiency described by the above equation is in general lower than the more exact results presented in @xcite . in the equation above",
    ", the dimensionless mass accretion rate is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "the interaction between the radiation and the galactic ism proceeds through two channels .",
    "one is via radiation pressure , and the other is the radiative heating . when evaluating radiative heating via compton scattering , an important concept is the compton temperature , which is the energy - weighted average photon energy of the radiation emitted by the agn .",
    "it is defined as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is radiative flux , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the plank and boltzmann constants , respectively .",
    "obviously , the value of @xmath5 is determined by the spectrum of the radiation from the agn .",
    "sazonov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) assessed a full range of observational data of quasars , computed the associated spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and finally calculated the typical compton temperature of bright quasar , obtaining @xmath26 k. such a temperature is well above the central temperature of the cooling flow gas .",
    "so it is natural to expect that radiative feedback from quasars could have profound affects on their host galaxies .",
    "in fact , the radiative heating can be written as ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ionization parameter , @xmath29 is the flux of photoionizing photons and @xmath30 is the number density of the ism .",
    "now the question is what is the value of @xmath5 of the radiation spectrum produced by llagns , i.e. , in the radio mode .",
    "the previous works adopted the same value as in the quasar mode .",
    "however , observations show that the spectra produced by llagns and quasar are quite different , with the most characteristic one being the lack of the `` big blue bump '' in llagns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the review by yuan & narayan @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of llagns is more `` x - ray loud '' than that of quasar ( refer to fig . 7 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this means that the spectra of llagns are much harder than that of quasars , i.e. , there is a larger fraction of high - energy photons .",
    "@xcite have made an initial calculation to the emitted spectrum from a hot accretion flow and found that the corresponding compton temperature @xmath5 could be as high as @xmath31 k. we would like to emphasize that there are two caveats in this calculation .",
    "one is that such value of @xmath5 is calculated from the theoretical spectrum emitted from hot accretion flows . in reality , since the accretion model of llagns also include a truncated thin disk @xcite , we should also include the contribution of such a thin disk . so that the best way is to directly calculate @xmath5 from the observed spectra of llagns at various luminosities .",
    "taking an llagn ",
    "ngc3998  as an example , we have calculated the corresponding @xmath5 following eq .",
    "the multiwaveband spectrum of this source is combined in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath32k , although there are some uncertainties in the value of the high - energy cutoff in its x - ray spectrum .",
    "so this seems to indicate that the `` theoretical spectrum '' adopted in @xcite is not a bad approximation at least for some sources , although it is still necessary to check the other sources with various luminosities .",
    "the second caveat , which is perhaps more important , is that the relativistic effects are not included in @xcite and eq .",
    "( 4 ) . obviously",
    ", combining the sed of various agns with various luminosities and calculating their @xmath5 after take into account all relativistic effects will be an important work ( yuan et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "including relativistic effects is likely reduce the value of @xmath5 , which will then weaken the radiative heating in the kinetic mode .",
    "however , this effect may be cancelled in some degree since the radiative efficiency we adopt in the present paper ( i.e. , eq .",
    "2 ) is lower than the exact value calculated in @xcite . given these complications , in the present work ,",
    "we simply adopt @xmath33 k. such a large value of @xmath5 means that even though the bolometric luminosity of llagns is low , its radiative feedback effects are potentially important .",
    "this is further strengthened by the possibility that galaxies may spend most of their time in the llagn phase .    in this paper",
    "we intend to evaluate quantitatively effects of radiative feedback in the radio mode . to this aim",
    "we study two types of models , namely model `` f '' and model `` v '' .",
    "model `` f '' is for comparison purpose . in this model ,",
    "the compton temperature is fixed to be @xmath34k , irrespective of the luminosity of the accretion flow , just as in previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in model ``",
    "v '' , the compton temperature of the spectrum is variable , and is a function of the luminosity of the accretion flow .",
    "specifically , when the accretion rate is high , i.e. , the system is in the quasar mode , we adopt @xmath34k ; when the accretion rate is low , i.e. , the system is in the radio mode , we adopt @xmath35k .",
    "the key question is how to treat the transition between the radio and quasar modes .",
    "since the physics of black hole accretion is presumably independent of the black hole mass , we can gain some insight from the observations of black hole x - ray binaries . with the change of accretion rates , this kind of sources transit between two distinct states , namely soft and hard ones .",
    "the spectra of the two states are quite different , with the hard state being much harder than the soft state .",
    "the accretion flow in these two states are the standard thin disk and hot accretion flows respectively @xcite , and the physics of the transition between these two accretion modes is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the dividing luminosity between the two states is @xmath36 @xcite , so that in model `` v '' we adopt the compton temperature as @xmath37      in addition to radiation , the nuclear wind from accretion flow is another important channel of agn feedback .",
    "we neglect the role of jet since ( at least for an isolated galaxy ) it is believed that jets simply drill through the surrounding gas and have little effect to the galaxy .",
    "winds provide mass , energy and momentum rushing into the ism .",
    "the existence of wind in the quasar mode has been directly confirmed by observations , e.g. , via the broad absorption lines in some quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of radio mode ,",
    "outflows have also been detected recently in llagns .",
    "@xcite investigated the outflow from a sample of nearby agns .",
    "of the ten nearby seyfert 1 galaxies in their sample , six sources still have their bolometric luminosities below @xmath38 .",
    "their detailed study of the uv and x - ray absorbers clearly shows that a strong outflow exists in these sources .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of one source , ngc 4395 , is even as low as @xmath39 .",
    "most recently , the existence of outflow in sgr a * has been confirmed by chandra observations @xcite . theoretically , the existence of winds have been confirmed by mhd numerical simulation , although agreement has not been achieved on the mass flux of winds @xcite .",
    "following previous works , we adopt a phenomenological approach and notate the properties of wind , namely the fluxes of mass , energy , and momentum , as follows @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the velocity of the wind , and @xmath8 is the mechanical efficiency , which describes the ratio of the wind power and the accretion power . as discussed in detail in @xcite , these expressions guarantee that the mass , energy , and momentum carried by the wind are self - consistent .",
    "the velocity of the wind in the case of quasar mode is relatively well observed , which is roughly @xmath42 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the radio mode ,",
    "however @xmath41 is poorly constrained by observations . from the theoretical point of view , yuan et al .",
    "( @xcite ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) discuss in a preliminary essay the terminal velocity of wind based on their mhd numerical simulation of hot accretion flow .",
    "more systematic study is ongoing ( yuan et al .",
    "2014 in preparation ) .",
    "in the present work , we tentatively adopt the same @xmath41 as in the quasar mode .",
    "as for the mechanical efficiency @xmath8 , even in the case of relatively better observed quasar mode , its value is poorly constrained .",
    "given this situation , @xcite considered two prescriptions of mechanical feedback , and the corresponding families of models were indicated as `` models @xmath43 '' and `` models @xmath44 '' . for models @xmath43 , both the mechanical efficiency ( denoted as @xmath45 ) and the wind opening angles are independent of the accretion rate . in models",
    "@xmath44 , these two quantities vary with the accretion rate , and are arranged to be small at small accretion rates and reach a specified maximum at the eddington rate ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "that is , we have @xmath46 } \\cr \\displaystyle{{3\\over 4}\\cdot{\\epsilon_w^m ~ l\\over 1 + 0.25 l}},\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\ , { \\rm [ b]}}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that the efficiency of models b is in general much lower than in models a. when @xmath48 , the mechanical efficiency @xmath8 of models b is identical to that of models a , but will drop rapidly with the decrease of @xmath49 .",
    "a natural question is then , which one is more realistic among model a and b. in the case of hot accretion flow , in which the outflow is likely mainly produced by mhd mechanism @xcite , it is still an open question how the efficiency changes with luminosity .",
    "but in the case of radiative line - driven winds , numerical simulations ( focused on the inner few hundred @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the gravitational constant ) indicate that @xmath8 does fall off when the luminosity decreases @xcite . in this sense",
    ", model b seems to be more realistic .",
    "following @xcite , we parameterize the angular distribution of the nuclear wind properties as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a conserved quantity ( mass , energy , or radial momentum ) , @xmath55 is the total amount of the conserved quantity to be injected , and @xmath56 is the solid angle covered by winds .",
    "we set @xmath57 so that the half - opening angle enclosing half of the mechanical energy is @xmath58 . in terms of solid angle",
    ", this means that the wind is visible from @xmath59 of the available viewing angles @xcite .",
    "this fraction is also in agreement with observations of the fraction of obscured and unobscured agns @xcite under the assumption that the two populations are made up of a single population of objects that differ only in viewing angle .    under the above assumptions",
    ", we can conveniently introduce in the numerical simulations the wind feedback by injecting the desired mass , energy , and momentum into the innermost cells of the simulation domain and self - consistently compute the radial transport of these quantities .",
    "the gravitational potential of the galaxy is contributed to by a dark matter halo and a stellar spheroid embedded in it , with a central black hole . as common",
    ", we ignore the self - gravity of the ism in the simulations .",
    "we note that the stellar population is of critical importance in our galactic scale simulations because : ( i ) the gravity due to the stellar spheroid is dominant at the scale of @xmath60 kpc from the galaxy center ; ( ii ) abundant gas will be released during the stellar evolution , which is the main gas resource of material fueling the black hole in our simulation . in fact , over a cosmological time span , the evolving stellar population will inject gas of mass summing up to @xmath61 of the total initial stellar mass into the galaxy , and this injected mass is therefore @xmath62 two orders of magnitude larger than the black hole mass observed in elliptical galaxies ( as @xmath63 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar mass losses are thermalized by the relative motion of the stars and ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in addition , supernova explosions provide additional source of mass , metals and energy .",
    "a full description of the build - up of the gaseous halo of the galaxy , up to onset of the first `` cooling catastrophe '' , has been given elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here is sufficient to recall that when the ism density reaches a critical value , suddenly a large amount of cooling gas falls toward the center , a part of it accretes onto the central black hole , a part forms stars , and the remaining is expelled from the central region , until a new cycle repeats . in a word , the stellar population",
    "not only determines the source of the accreting gas but also is important to the gaseous dynamics and to the black hole growth .    in the present models , we adopt the jaffe profile for the stellar component , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the total stellar mass and the scale - length of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "observations show that the total density distributions of ellipticals can usually be well described by a @xmath67 profile over a large radial range @xcite . for this reason",

    "stellar evolution contributes further to the gas dynamics via type ia supernova ( sn ia ) explosions , which are the results of degenerate white dwarfs , e.g. , accreting white dwarfs which finally reach the chandrasekhar limit and mergers of two white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we assume that each sn ia ejects @xmath71 erg of energy and @xmath72 of material into the ism .",
    "as anticipated , the sn ia rate evolves secularly as @xmath73 , so that the specific heating of the injected gas increases with time .",

    "then we focus on some more specific property of the models .      in general ,",
    "the simulation results are similar to those presented in @xcite . for examples ,",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot - b05v ] shows the snapshot of the density and temperature of the interstellar medium at different epochs for model b05v used here as a reference model , being the results of other models similar . at early times , the ism is very tenuous and the galaxy is in a quiescent phase , where only the passive evolution of stellar population is taking place .",
    "stellar mass losses enrich the gas content of the galaxy gradually .",
    "meanwhile , such gas is heated to a temperature near ( slithtly higher ) the local virial temperature as determined by the local stellar velocity dispersion and by type ia supernova explosions . in this evolutionary phase ,",
    "the accretion onto the black hole is very low , and it is bondi - like . the black hole remains quiescent until the ism is globally cooled via radiative cooling .",
    "this catastrophic cooling leads to collapse of ism toward the center , i.e. , a `` cooling flow '' occurs , beginning with the formation of a cold shell of @xmath62 kpc radius @xcite .",
    "such a cold shell is unstable due to the rayleigh - taylor instability and to be disrupted quickly . on the path towards to the galactic center",
    ", the gas becomes even denser both due to the volume effect and to the accumulation of gas by the collapsing cold shell .",
    "the increase of gas density in turn enhances radiative cooling , which is proportional to density squared .",
    "such a cool and dense environment is ideal for star formation or even a starburst ( fig.[fig : snapshot - b05v ] left panel ) . actually , star formation is a very significant process of consuming the accreting gas ( about 1/3 of the total ) before it reaches the black hole .",
    "finally the black hole gets the fuel and agn activity is triggered ( fig . [",
    "fig : snapshot - b05v ] , middle panel )",
    ".    once the central agn is accreting at a significant level , it produces radiation and a nuclear wind .",
    "they interact with the interstellar medium in the galaxy , which in turn regulates the central agn feeding . for radiative feedback",
    ", the ambient gas could be heated almost immediately because of the irradiation by agn via , e.g. , inverse compton scattering and photoionization .",
    "the mechanical feedback by outflow / wind is important mainly in the region very near to the black hole as mass flow can immediately mix into the ambient ism , affect the gas dynamics by ram pressure and heat the gas via shocks . as shown by the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot - b05v ] , when the ism is either heated or pushed outward as the consequence of radiative and mechanical feedback , gas is expelled from the galactic center , leaving behind a hot cavity .",

    "a complete discussion of the life cycle of cold shells , their evolution under the action of radiative losses , agn feedback , star formation , can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also studied the synchrotron emission produced by the agn bursts , that behave like a giant supernova remnant .",
    "we note that agn feedback is not only _ negative _ , quenching the cooling flow , but could also be _ positive _ in some situations , inducing star formation in the central region of the galaxy @xcite      the light curve of the agn luminosity over the whole cosmic epoch has been shown in @xcite for model a. figure [ fig : acc - his - b05v ] shows the light curve for a `` b '' type model ( in particular model b05v ) .",
    "the three panels correspond to different time resolutions . by comparison with fig . 6 in @xcite",
    "it can be seen that the overall luminosity evolution of models a and b is quite similar .",
    "the black hole accretion is very chaotic with a complicate temporal substructure , and many feedback loops are observed .",
    "a decline of the overall profile is clearly shown ( top panel ) .",
    "since the luminosity is shown in unit of @xmath21 , such a decline is mainly due to the mass growth of the central black hole .",
    "the luminosity evolution reflects the hydrodynamical phases briefly summarized in  [ sec : overview ] .",
    "we can see that the luminosity valleys are followed by a relatively long - term climb ( middle panel ) .",
    "these are dividing points of feedback loops and signatures of strong agn feedbacks .",
    "agn feedback heats the ism , expel it out of the galactic center and stop the nuclear activities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot - b05v ] right panel ) , until a new cooling cycle begins followed by black hole accretion . in the bottom panel , we can see the luminosity fluctuations on short time scales , i.e. , the temporal substructure within a single accretion event .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instability and the interaction of direct and reflected shock waves ( see @xcite @xcite for a full discussion , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are the main causes of such fluctuations .",
    "in fact , in fig . [",
    "fig : snapshot - b05v ] ( left panel ) we can see that a cool dense shell forms around the galactic center : the density in the shell is higher than that of its inner gas , while the gravitational force points to the center . as a result , the cold shell fractures and falls onto the center piece by piece asynchronously , which finally induces the quick fluctuations in the light curves .    figure [ fig : acc - his - a1 ] compares the different light curves of different models , namely a vs. b and f vs. v. the upper panel shows the light curves of model a1v ( red dashed line ) and model a1f ( blue solid line ) .",
    "both of the light curves are chaotic , and there is little qualitative difference between the two models .",
    "this is not surprising because in models `` a '' the mechanical agn feedback by nuclear winds is independent of @xmath120 , so that the change of radiative feedback ( f vs. v ) is not important .",
    "the behavior of the light curve changes for model b whose mechanical efficiency is smaller thus mechanical feedback is weaker .",
    "it can become not chaotic at all , as shown by the blue solid line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : acc - his - a1 ] ( for model b05f )",
    ". however , the light curve shown by the red dashed line ( model b05v ) is again chaotic .",
    "this is because in this model , although the mechanical feedback is weaker , the radiative feedback becomes stronger due to the consideration of a higher @xmath5 in the kinetic mode .",
    "in addition , during most epochs of the evolution , the accretion luminosity is significantly lower in model b05v than in model b05f . this result is because of the stronger radiative heating in model `` v '' due to the higher compton temperature which results in a overall smaller accretion rate during the evolution .      in the third column of table [",
    "tab : model - summary ] , we list the mass - weighted mean radiative efficiencies @xmath121 of the black hole accretion flow averaged over the evolution time as @xmath122 note that if the bulk of black hole accretion is in quasar mode , then according to eqs.([eq : eps - em])-([eq : mdot ] ) one expects @xmath123 . instead , if low luminosity accretion is important , @xmath124 .",
    "in all of the models except models a0f and a0v , @xmath121 lies in a narrow range @xmath125 .",
    "this efficiency is similar to that found by @xcite applying the soltan argument ( @xcite , see also * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but correcting for orbiting and ejected black holes .",
    "the values of @xmath121 in model a0f and a0v are the smallest .",
    "this is because of the strong mechanical feedback : the mechanical efficiency @xmath8 in these two models is the largest among all models .",
    "such a strong wind is very efficient in regulating mass accretion , since it pushes the gas away , thus the accretion rates are on average lower compared to other models . when the accretion rate is low , the efficiency will also become low .",
    "in general , the value of @xmath121 is slightly larger in models `` v '' than in `` f '' .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "refer to eq .",
    "[ eq : averaged_efficiency ] the numerator is obviously dominated by the contribution in the quasar mode , which is roughly same for the models `` v '' and `` f '' because the change of @xmath5 only applies in the low luminosity radio mode .",
    "the denominator is precisely equal to the growth of the black hole , i.e , the fourth column in table [ tab : model - summary ] .",
    "compared to model `` f '' , the compton heating in model `` v '' is stronger due to the higher @xmath5 .",
    "when the gas temperature is higher , the mass accretion rate will be lower .",
    "this results in an overall smaller black hole growth over the cosmological time , as discussed in the following section .",
    "the regulation of black hole growth at the centers of spheroids is an important effect of agn feedback .",
    "in fact , we recall that also in isolated galaxies ( i.e. , no merging ) , the gas produced by the evolving stars over the whole evolution is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the observed masses of black hole in the local universe . the fourth column in table [ tab : model - summary ]",
    "is the mass growth @xmath126 of the supermassive black hole during the whole evolution epoch .    for both model `` v '' and `` f ''",
    ", we can see that the black hole growth is quite sensitive to the mechanical efficiency @xmath45 , namely @xmath126 drops rapidly when @xmath45 increases .",
    "physically , this is because with the increase of @xmath45 , the gas surrounding the black hole is pushed away more strongly , thus the mass accretion rate decreases .",
    "interestingly enough , we find that there exists a critical @xmath127 , below which the black hole growth @xmath126 is insensitive to @xmath8 .",
    "this is the case of models b3f and b4f ( or b3v and b4v ) .",
    "the explanation is that below such a small value of @xmath45 , the agn feedback becomes dominated by radiative feedback .    in the regime of low mechanical efficiency ( @xmath128 )",
    ", we found too much black hole growth .",
    "for example , in models b3f and b4f the final mass of the black hole is up to @xmath129 , which is beyond the typical mass range of a supermassive black hole . in the regime of high mechanical efficiency",
    "( @xmath130 ) , the black hole growth is heavily suppressed , e.g. in models a0f and a0v , which results in a too low level of agn activity as argued in @xcite .",
    "thus we arrive at the important conclusion that the model - favored mechanical efficiency , for both type `` f '' and type `` v '' model , lies in a range of @xmath131 , which is consistent with the previous works and observational suggestions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite@xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a mechanical efficiency seems to be roughly consistent with the mhd numerical simulation to the outflow in hot accretion flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "34 therein ) .    in the case of fixed compton temperature , we find that the mass of the black holes in models bf are all larger than in the corresponding models af .",
    "this is obviously because of the stronger mechanical efficiency @xmath8 in model a than in model b for given @xmath45 .",
    "for example , as shown in table [ tab : model - summary ] , the final black hole mass in a0f is smaller than that in b0f by nearly two orders of magnitude , and is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than in model `` nowind.f '' , in which there is no nuclear wind at all . from table [",
    "tab : model - summary ] , we can see that sometimes the final mass of the black hole can be as large as over @xmath129 .",
    "this obviously violates the observations , and indicates that when a fixed @xmath5 is adopted models b tend to overpredict the final black hole mass , although they may be more realistic than models a as we have mentioned in  1 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with that in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great importance that the black hole growth @xmath132 in models `` v '' with variable compton temperature is systematically smaller .",
    "this is true for both models a and b. this is because a higher @xmath5 is adopted in model `` v '' in the radio mode .",
    "a higher @xmath5 implies that the gas surrounding the black hole is heated to a higher temperature , the mass accretion rate is smaller and less material is accreted by the black hole .",
    "this conclusion is also reinforced by the fact that when @xmath8 is smaller , the discrepancy of @xmath132 between models `` v '' and `` f '' is larger .",
    "this is because when @xmath8 is smaller , the role of mechanical feedback becomes less important compared to the radiative feedback therefore the effect of @xmath5 will be more significant .",
    "an important result in this context is that even for model b , when we consider a higher @xmath5 in the hot accretion phase ( i.e. , kinetic mode ) , i.e. , model `` v '' , the final mass of the black hole is not unrealistically large .",
    "the effect of a changing @xmath5 is so relevant that it is testified also by the limiting case model `` nowind.v '' , in which there is no wind feedback at all and the mass of the black hole is the largest , however also in this case the final mass of the black hole remains below @xmath133 .",
    "such a range of black hole mass is fully consistent with observations , thus models `` b '' are `` revived '' .",
    "one of the most important results that @xcite found is that for models b , in addition to the problem of black hole growth , also the agn duty cycle is not consistent with observations .",
    "when a high @xmath5 is adopted as in our model `` v '' , the dynamics of the gas fueling the black hole and subsequently the mass accretion rate is completely changed . as a consequence , also the agn duty cycle changes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : duty_cycle - b05 ] we plot agn duty cycle as a function of eddington ratio , taking model b05f ( left panels ) and b05v ( right panels ) as illustrative examples of the effect of a high @xmath5 .",

    "the black and red lines show the cumulative time above and below the given eddington ratio , respectively .",
    "solid lines are the results compiled from the entire simulation time , while dashed lines only use the data in the final 2 gyr .",
    "the points are observational constraints taken from literature .",

    "the squares , cycles , upward- and downward- pointing triangles are from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively , which are all compiled from low - redshift observations and should be compared with dashed lines .",
    "the star is a constraint compiled from high - redshift observations by @xcite , which should be compared with solid lines .",
    "the top / left panel shows that there are too many agn burst activities during the entire evolution time in model b05f ( solid line ) , but at the same time the agn activity in the last 2 gyr is perhaps too moderate compared to the observational constraints ( dashed line ) .",
    "these problems of models b with fixed @xmath5 were already pointed out in @xcite . for this reason it is particularly relevant that in the top / right panel , one can observe a remarkable improvement in model b05v , in which a higher @xmath5 is adopted in the phase of hot accretion flow .",
    "this result , combined with the more realistic growth of the black hole we have described in  [ blackholegrowth ] , indicates that models b ( and their improvements ) have good potentialities to be used in realistic simulations .",
    "in fact , the importance of radiative feedback in the kinetic mode can be anticipated from the top / left panel of fig .",

    "we can see that the values of @xmath138 are quite similar for all of the models despite of the large range of @xmath45 and different treatment of @xmath5 .",
    "the reason is that agn feedback by both winds and radiation mainly acts on the few inner kpc , and only in exceptionally strong accretion episodes the resulting shock waves can reach the galaxy outskirts . in the outer region of the galaxy , where most of the galactic winds originate from ,",
    "agn feedback does not play an important role and it is mainly sn ia heating that controls the gas dynamics .    the last column in table [ tab : model - summary ] presents the total ism mass @xmath140 remaining within 70 kpc at the end of the simulations .",

    "we can see that within @xmath142 kpc , the emission profiles become systematically flatter in model `` v '' than in model `` f '' .",

    "but in the kinetic mode , the accretion flow is described by a hot accretion flow thus the corresponding compton temperature should be higher . following previous theoretical work , we adopt @xmath35k . this in general results in a stronger radiative feedback as adopted in @xcite .",
    "consequently , we find that the accretion processes are more chaotic and further suppressed .",
    "specifically , we find that model b now predicts a correct range of black hole mass and agn duty cycle . in more general sense ,",
    "our study indicate that in the kinetic mode , radiative feedback is much more important than previous thought and should be seriously considered in future studies .    some improvements can be made based on the present work in the future .",
    "first , as we have mentioned in the paper , we have simply chosen @xmath33 k as the compton temperature of the emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows .",
    "this value comes from the calculation based on the theoretical spectrum from a hot accretion flow . in reality",
    ", the accretion flow is composed of an inner hot accretion flow plus an outer truncated thin disk ( see @xcite @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the best way is to combine the observed spectral energy distribution of llagns with various luminosities and calculate the compton temperature as a function of luminosity .",
    "moreover , relativistic effect may be important in calculating @xmath5 which was unfortunately neglected in the previous work .    a complementary aspect of this study that needs an improvement is the description of the properties of the nuclear wind as a function of the black hole accretion state . in particular , issues line the mechanical efficiency @xmath8 , the wind speed and its angular distribution .",
    "in fact , as we have shown in this paper , @xmath8 is of crucial importance for the evaluation of mechanical feedback .",
    "but unfortunately this value is still poorly constrained by observations or by theories so we have to treat it as a free parameter , although some initial results have been obtained , e.g. , in the study of hot accretion flows @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of wind , which is also expected to be important to mechanical feedback , is again poorly constrained . in this paper",
    "we assume a `` bipolar - like '' angular distribution function of the wind . in the future",
    ", it is expected that the theoretical studies will be able to better constrain these two properties .",
    "in fact , we are using the mhd numerical simulation data to study the wind from hot accretion flows and some initial results have been obtained . for example , we find that the winds do have a wide range of distribution angles , from @xmath147 . but different from the `` bipolar - like '' structure , we find that most of the mass flux of wind seem to be concentrate on the disk surface",
    ". it will be interesting to examine its effect in cooperation with the variations of @xmath5 .",
    "we thank scott tremaine for useful discussion of the soltan argument , and silvia pellegrini for the comments of the x - ray properties of the ism , and the referee for the helpful comments and suggestions .",

    "<S> based on two - dimensional high resolution hydrodynamic numerical simulation , we study the mechanical and radiative feedback effects from the central agn on the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy . physical processes such as star formation and supernovae are considered . the inner boundary of the simulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial bondi radius is resolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined self - consistently . in analogy to previous works , we assume that the specific angular momentum of the galaxy is low . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that when the accretion rates are high and low , the central agns will be in cold and hot accretion modes , which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than that from the cold accretion flows , which could result in a higher compton temperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating , according to previous theoretical works . </S>",
    "<S> such a difference of the compton temperature between the two feedback modes , the focus of this study , has been neglected in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found as a result of the stronger compton heating and accretion becomes more chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth and agn duty cycle after cosmological evolution , we find that the favored model parameters are constrained : mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with decreasing luminosity ( the maximum efficiency being @xmath0 ) and x - ray compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity , although models with fixed mechanical efficiency and compton temperature can be found that are satisfactory as well . we conclude that radiative feedback in the kinetic mode is much more important than previously thought . </S>"
