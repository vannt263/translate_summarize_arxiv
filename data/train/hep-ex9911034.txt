    "the study of the c  quark generates about 200 papers and 800 measurements per year , for a total of 15 collaborations and 700 physicists involved .",
    "such an effort has led us to a conflicting situation .",
    "on one hand , the advent of high - statistics , high - resolution experiments has turned c  quark physics into precision physics . on the other hand , the c  quark mass scale is too large for chiral symmetry methods , while theories based on expansions of heavy quark masses , such as heavy quark effective theory@xcite ( hqet ) or operator product expansion@xcite ( ope ) , are often questionable because @xmath0 may not be large enough .",
    "nonetheless , remarkable agreement is often found when such theories make predictions , most notably on semileptonic decays , lifetimes , and spectroscopy .",
    "the 1998 - 1999 scenario is full of results  from new experiments ( selex and bes ) , experiments that have undergone significant upgrades ( focus , 2 , e835 ) , and others that are planning upgrades for charm physics ( hermes ) , experiments at their peak publication rate ( e791 ) , and experiments ( at lep and hera ) that keep their charm working groups alive and vital .",
    "interesting news comes from the neutrino ( ccfr , charm  ii ) and heavy - ion ( na50 ) groups .    in this paper",
    "i have tried to present a review of today s scenario rather than pursue the goal of detailed investigation . in setting the physics scenario for each item ,",
    "i was guided by recent reviews@xcite , from which i borrowed copiously . with such a goal in mind ,",
    "i apologize in advance to those whose work has been left unmentioned .",
    "the qcd picture of charm production consists of parton - level hard scattering , which produces the @xmath1 pair , hadronization of the @xmath1 into a charmed hadron , and a final stage in which the charmed hadron travels through and interacts with the hadronic matter , followed by decay .",
    "thanks to the generally large momentum transfers involved , the hard scattering is traditionally a good testing ground for perturbative qcd techniques , while the hadronization stage has the complication of matching experimental kinematical distributions of charm hadrons with predictions of a suitable dressing mechanism . theoretical updates on both topics were given at hq98 @xcite .",
    "in general , any asymmetry is due to hadronization since @xmath1 asymmetries in nlo qcd are very small . for a seminal review see ref.@xcite .",
    "a wealth of new results comes from fermilab fixed - target experiments e791 , selex and focus ( pion , hyperon , and photon beams respectively)@xcite .",
    "correlation studies of fully reconstructed hadroproduced @xmath2 pairs by e791@xcite show less correlation than that predicted by the pythia / jetset monte carlo event generator for @xmath2 production , which , however , follows the experimental trend better than a pure nlo qcd parton level prediction ( fig.[fig : prodo ] ) .",
    "coherently , @xmath2 correlation in photoproduction is much more pronounced because of a lack of hadronization contributions of the projectile remnants .",
    ".compilation of @xmath3 photoproduction asymmetry measurements ( adapted from ref.@xmath4 ) .",
    "[ tab : asy ] [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     during 1998 , cleo@xcite presented evidence for the two @xmath5 missing states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively @xmath8 and @xmath9 , through the radiative decay @xmath10 .",
    "masses measured are compatible with predictions@xcite .    only a few of the orbitally excited p - wave @xmath11 baryons have been observed .",
    "the first doublet @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 was observed several years ago by 2 , argus , and e687 . in 1999",
    "2 presented evidence@xcite for the charmed - strange baryon analogous to @xmath14 , called @xmath16 , in its decay to @xmath17 via an intermediate @xmath18 state .",
    "the presence of intermediate @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 is an indication of @xmath20 assignment , while hqs explicitly forbids a direct transition to the @xmath21 ground state , because of angular momentum and parity conservation .",
    "the last topic of this section is the mass difference between isospin states of charmed baryons ( isosplits ) . lately , interest in this issue was revamped@xcite led by the consideration that , while for all well - measured isodoublets one increases the baryon mass by replacing a @xmath22quark with a @xmath23quark , the opposite happens in the case of the poorly measured @xmath24 isosplit . besides the @xmath25 quark mass difference , isosplits are in general sensitive to em effects , and spin  spin hyperfine interactions .",
    "new focus results@xcite are consistent with e791 , and mildly inconsistent with cleo  ii ( tab.[tab : iso ] ) .",
    "finally , first measurement of the @xmath26 width was presented at this conference ",
    "full details in d.  besson s review .    in the baryon sector , the discovery of double - charm states would be of fundamental importance .",
    "a recent theoretical work@xcite shows how a ( nearly ) model  independent approach based on the feynman - hellman theorem is able to compute heavy - flavor hadron masses in very good agreement with experiments , and to make predictions for double - charm states . as an example , the mass of the @xmath27 is predicted at @xmath28 , and dominant decay modes are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "such a discovery does not seem within reach of either cleo , or present fixed - target experiments .",
    "charmonium states are produced at @xmath31 storage rings and through @xmath32 annihilation .",
    "the @xmath31 annihilation proceeds , at first order , via a virtual photon and only @xmath33 states can be directly formed .",
    "nonvector states such as the @xmath34 states can be observed only via two ",
    "step processes as @xmath35 , or higher order processes . on the contrary , in @xmath32 annihilations",
    "all @xmath36 quantum numbers are accessible .",
    "new data come from @xmath31 bes@xcite and @xmath32 e835@xcite .",
    "results include measurements of masses and widths of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "a @xmath40 disagreement remains between their @xmath39 mass determinations .",
    "moreover , the width @xmath41 measured by e835 is nearly a factor of two narrower than the pdg98 world average , with which , instead , recent data from l3 , opal , and bes agree .",
    "the most intriguing puzzle in charmonium physics seems to remain the case for the pseudoscalar radial excitation @xmath42 . claimed in 1982 by crystal barrel at @xmath43 ,",
    "it was not confirmed by either delphi or e835 extensive searches ( @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) .",
    "the e835 data - taking period at the end of 1999 sees the search for the @xmath47 approved as prioritary .",
    "the major news this year in charm physics comes from the advances in lifetime measurement technology .",
    "the @xmath48 lifetime is now conclusively measured as being larger than @xmath49 , and the lifetime ratio can be used ( along with the new measurements of dcsd branching ratios ) to constrain the sizes of the wa and wx operators .",
    "new limits on @xmath50 mixing also come mainly from the novel capability of measuring the lifetimes of opposite cp eigenstates .",
    "the other field where impressive news comes from is spectroscopy , with hqs predictions being spectacularly confirmed by the observation of an excited broad meson state , while the puzzles of meson radial excitations and the very existance of the @xmath51 still elude us . at the opening of the third millenium , besides results from e791 , focus , selex , 2 , e835 , and bes , we should expect first data on @xmath50 mixing from the babar and belle b - factories .",
    "the future of post - y2k charm physics is less clear .",
    "no new fixed - target data - taking periods for charm studies are planned either at fermilab , or at cern for the near future ( compass commissioning is scheduled to begin in 2000 , with a busy physics programme which includes charm muonproduction , dis spin - physics , gluon structure functions , and light - quark hadronic physics ) . despite the significant upgrade planned , it is not clear whether cleo",
    "iii will retain competitivity with respect to b - factories .",
    "future experiments at high - energy hadron machines ( hera - b , btev , lhc - b ) will need to tame huge backgrounds in order to contribute to charm physics . intense workshop activity@xcite on a @xmath31 @xmath52-charm factory has not translated into an actual proposal  perhaps the operational experience coming from low - energy , high - luminosity @xmath53 machines such as frascati da@xmath54ne is needed .",
    "interesting ideas come from a proposal for a @xmath55 collider operating at the open charm threshold@xcite . on the other hand , a few specialized efforts have been approved , in the form of experiments undertaking upgrades for specific study of open charm physics ( hermes , na50 ) .",
    "the distant future will probably see charm @xmath56-production from muon storage rings .",
    "next year , the lisbon conference will be an appropriate time to verify whether such a scenario had evolved .",
    "this review would not have been possible without the unconditioned help of the spokespersons and analysis coordinators of the experiments which provided me with recent data : aleph , delphi , opal , bes , e791 , l3 , selex , e835 , zeus , h1 , na50 , hermes , nusea .",
