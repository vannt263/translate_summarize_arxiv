    "thus , the lemma follows if there are two or more connected components .    if @xmath148 then the first @xmath42 and the final @xmath125 also form a pair of neighbors .",
    "( an easy induction argument using the growth rules shows that the word @xmath149 has @xmath1 upward - pointing strands dangling , each labeled with @xmath125 , and the leftmost of these is adjacent to the edge from @xmath43 .",
