    "kummer covers are a very useful tool in order to construct complicated algebraic curves starting from simple ones .",
    "since kummer covers are finite galois covers of @xmath2 with @xmath3 , topological properties of the new curves can be obtained : alexander polynomial , fundamental group , characteristic varieties and so on ( see @xcite for papers using these techniques ) .",
    "on the other hand , the braid monodromy of a plane projective curve is a powerful invariant that provides a way to compute the fundamental group of its complement and was originally described as a formalization of the zariski - van kampen method  @xcite ( see @xcite also  @xcite and references therein for a detailed exposition on the subject ) .",
    "however , braid monodromy is a much more powerful invariant , since in fact it encodes the topology of the embedding of the curve , as well as the isomorphism problem for surfaces whose branching locus over @xmath4 is a given curve ( see  @xcite to name only a few ) .    in this work",
    "we focus our attention on a method to reconstruct the braid monodromy of the preimage of a curve by a kummer cover .",
    "this method is interesting in and of itself , since it combines two techniques , namely , the reconstruction of a highly non - generic braid monodromy with a systematic method to go from a non - generic to a generic braid monodromy .",
    "this `` _ _ generification _ _ '' method is independent from kummer covers and can be applied in more general circumstances ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is that oftentimes , non - generic braid monodromies are much easier to compute .",
    "the importance of finding theoretical arguments to obtain braid monodromies lies in the fact that any direct computation requires polynomial root approximation , whose exactness can only be justified in particularly simple cases , such as curves whose equation can be given in @xmath5 $ ] ( @xcite ) , strongly real curves ( @xcite and references therein ) , or line arrangements ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : after describing in  [ sec - settings ] the main objects to be used such as generic and non - generic braid monodromies , kummer covers and extended braid monodromies are described in  [ sec - pencils ] as the main tool to recover a non - generic braid monodromy of a kummer cover from a braid monodromy of the base . useful _ generification _",
    "techniques are described in   [ sec - deformation ]",
    ". sections ",
    "[ sec - cover - braids ] and  [ sec - trans ] are more technical and describe useful systems of artin generators for the braids obtained after a kummer cover and the properties and singularities of kummer transforms .",
    "finally , a detailed account of numerous examples ( some classical and some new ) of the power of kummer transforms is given in ",
    "[ sec - ex ] , where generic braid monodromies of smooth curves , sextics with six cusps ( on a conic and otherwise ) , sextics with nine cusps , hesse , ceva , and maclane arrangements are provided .",
