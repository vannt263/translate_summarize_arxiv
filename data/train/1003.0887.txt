    "kernel methods have been popular in machine learning and pattern analysis for their superior performance on a wide spectrum of learning tasks .",
    "they are broadly established as an easy way to construct nonlinear algorithms from linear ones , by embedding data points into higher dimensional reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhss ) @xcite .",
    "recently , this idea has been generalized to embed probability distributions into rkhss , which provides a linear method for dealing with higher order statistics @xcite .",
    "formally , given the set of all borel probability measures defined on the topological space @xmath0 , and the rkhs @xmath1 of functions on @xmath0 with @xmath2 as its reproducing kernel ( r.k . ) that is measurable and bounded , any borel probability measure , @xmath3 is embedded as , @xmath4 such an embedding has been found to be useful in many statistical applications like homogeneity testing @xcite , independence testing @xcite , dimensionality reduction @xcite , etc .",
    ", as it provides a powerful and straightforward method of dealing with higher - order statistics of random variables .",
    "however , in these applications , it is critical that the embedding in ( [ eq : prob ] ) is injective so that probability measures can be distinguished by their images in @xmath5 . to this end , @xcite introduced the notion of _ characteristic kernel _    a bounded , measurable @xmath6 is said to be _ characteristic _ if ( [ eq : prob ] ) is injective    for which many characterizations have recently been provided @xcite .    a natural extension to the above idea of embedding probability measures into an rkhs , @xmath5 is to embed finite signed borel measures , @xmath7 into @xmath5 as @xmath8 and study the conditions on the kernel , @xmath6 for which such an embedding is injective .",
    "although the embedding in ( [ eq : signedmeasure ] ) can be proposed and investigated for mathematical pleasure , we show as one of the main contributions of this paper that under certain conditions on @xmath7 and @xmath0 , the embedding in ( [ eq : signedmeasure ] ) is closely related to the concept of _ universal kernels _ ( see section  [ subsec : universal ] for the formal introduction to universal kernels ) , which was first proposed by @xcite    in the context of achieving the _ bayes risk _ in kernel - based classification / regression algorithms    and later extended by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this connection shows that the embedding in ( [ eq : signedmeasure ] ) is not just an abstract mathematical object , but has applications in kernel - based classification / regression algorithms . using the connection between ( [ eq : signedmeasure ] ) and universal kernels",
    ", we then show how the various notions of universality mentioned above are related to each other .",
    "in addition , since the embedding in ( [ eq : signedmeasure ] ) is a generalization of the embedding in ( [ eq : prob ] ) , we also demonstrate the relation between characteristic kernels and universal kernels , which extends the preliminary study carried out in ( * ? ? ? * section 3.4 ) .    in the remainder of this introduction , we provide a comprehensive overview of our contributions which are presented in detail in later sections .",
    "first , in section  [ subsec : universal ] , we introduce universality , briefly discuss various notions of universality that are proposed in literature , and outline our contribution : a measure embedding view point of universality , which is novel and different from the existing view point of approximating functions in some target space by functions in an rkhs .",
    "we show that a kernel is universal if and only if the embedding in ( [ eq : signedmeasure ] ) is injective .",
    "second , in section  [ subsec : relation ] , we discuss our second contribution of relating universal and characteristic kernels .      in the regularization approach to learning @xcite , it is well known that kernel - based algorithms ( for classification / regression ) generally invoke the _ representer theorem _ @xcite and learn a function in @xmath5 that has the representation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are parameters typically obtained from training data , @xmath12 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , one can ask whether the function , @xmath13 in ( [ eq : representer ] ) approximates any real - valued target function arbitrarily _",
    "well _ as the number of summands increases without bound .",
    "this is an important question to consider because if the answer is affirmative , then the kernel - based learning algorithm is _ consistent _ in the sense that for any target function , @xmath14 ( which is usually assumed to belong to some subset of the space of real - valued continuous functions defined on @xmath0 ) , the discrepancy between @xmath13 ( which is learned from the training data ) and @xmath14 goes to zero ( in some sense ) as the sample size goes to infinity . since @xmath15 is dense in @xmath5 @xcite , and assuming that the kernel - based algorithm makes @xmath13  converge to an appropriate function \" in @xmath5 as @xmath16 , the above question of approximating @xmath14 arbitrarily _ well _ by @xmath13 in ( [ eq : representer ] ) as @xmath17 goes to infinity is equivalent to the question of _ whether @xmath5 is rich enough to approximate any @xmath14 arbitrarily well _ ,",
    "i.e. , _ whether @xmath5 is universal_. we show that characterizing universal rkhss ( or equivalently , the characterization of corresponding reproducing kernels ( r.k . ) as any rkhs is uniquely determined by its reproducing kernel ) leads to the embedding in ( [ eq : signedmeasure ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the goal is to characterize @xmath5 that allow to approximate any @xmath14 in some target space , usually assumed to be some subset of the space of real - valued continuous functions on @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , depending on the choice of @xmath0 , the choice of target space and the type of approximation , various notions of _ universality _ have been proposed @xcite , which are briefly discussed in the following paragraphs .",
    "the eventual goal is to have a notion of universality that allows comprehensive ( and general ) necessary and/or sufficient conditions on the reproducing kernel for approximating , as strong as possible , a class of target functions , as general as possible .",
    "@xmath18-*universality : * let @xmath19 denote the space of continuous real - valued functions on some topological space , @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite considered the above approximation problem when @xmath0 is a compact metric space , with @xmath20 and defined a continuous kernel , @xmath6 as _ universal _ ( in this paper , we refer to it as _ c - universal _ ) if its associated rkhs , @xmath5 is dense in @xmath19 w.r.t .",

    ", this indicates that if a kernel is _ c - universal _ , then the corresponding kernel - based learning algorithm could be consistent in the sense that any target function , @xmath20 could be approximated arbitrarily well in the uniform norm by @xmath13 in ( [ eq : representer ] ) as @xmath17 goes to infinity ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "so , the natural question to ask is whether we can characterize @xmath5 that are rich enough to approximate any @xmath14 on non - compact @xmath0 in a stronger sense , i.e. , uniformly , by some @xmath26 .",
    "recently , this has been answered by ( * ? ? ?",
