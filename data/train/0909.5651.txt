    "damped lyman alpha ( dla ) absorbers are the primary reservoir of cool , neutral gas in the universe and the ability to detect them easily over a wide range of redshifts make them an important tracer of the evolution of gas in galaxies or protogalaxies over cosmic time .",
    "dla systems are identified at redshifts 0@xmath2z@xmath26 in the spectra of qsos @xcite .",
    "identified from the strong n=1 to n=2 absorption line of hi , the detection of these absorption - selected objects depends primarily on the brightness of the background qso rather than on emission from stars or gas .",
    "it is noteworthy that the column density of @xmath3 atoms  @xmath4 , that defines a dla @xcite , is similar to the threshold column density required for the onset of star formation in the local universe @xcite .",
    "dlas , then , should be associated with present - day visible galaxies @xcite . however",
    ", difficulty still remains in connecting observations of high - redshift dlas with those of low - redshift dlas , as well as connecting galaxy - evolution simulations with dla observations .",
    "simulations at low redshift by @xcite and @xcite indicate that the dla incidence is dominated by more compact , faint galaxies with a narrow impact parameter distribution ( @xmath23 kpc ) , rather than by large disk galaxies .",
    "observationally , low redshift dla systems have been shown to consist of galaxies spanning a wide range of luminosities , surface brightnesses , impact parameters , and morphologies @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the associated host galaxy to the dla has proven difficult to identify due to the high brightness contrast between the quasar and the absorbing galaxy .",
    "another issue in the identification of the host galaxy at high redshift is the fact that one can no longer detect faint galaxies that may be intercepting your sightline .",
    "this may cause a misidentification of the host galaxy , especially in high density regions like groups .",
    "this may contribute to the larger impact parameters being measured for high redshift systems .",
    "@xcite identified candidate hosts to high - redshift ( 2@xmath2z@xmath24 ) dlas through ifu observations of the ly@xmath5-emission line . while they have a small sample size , they find an average impact parameter of 16 kpc , and suggest the distribution of hi clouds for dlas extends far beyond the optical sizes of dwarfs .",
    "simulations by @xcite resulted in larger impact parameters ( 10 - 15 kpc ) for 2@xmath2z@xmath24 .",
    "selecting systems by identifying damped lyman-@xmath5 absorption provides only a pencil - beam examination of the gas content of dla host galaxies , missing the full gas content that can be probed .",
    "an alternative then , to searching for gas through lyman - alpha absorption , is to use the 21  cm emission line , which probes the global gas content in galaxies , to search for systems that are likely to show damped lyman-@xmath5 profiles if there were a background source .",
    "the hi hyperfine structure line at 21  cm is very weak , and its detection is currently limited to low redshifts .",
    "hi 21  cm observations probe the cold , neutral hydrogen gas in a galaxy and come in two forms , 21  cm absorption and 21  cm emission .",
    "21  cm absorption , like other absorption - line probes , provides a pencil - beam look at the hi content of a galaxy .",
    "it requires a background radio - loud point source and allows for a direct determination of @xmath6 .",
    "21  cm line emission is a probe of the gas contained within the beam of the telescope , smoothed according to the spatial resolution of the telescope .",
    "the resulting hi emission spectrum reveals the global hi content of the galaxy and allows for determination of the hi mass while maps show the distribution and cross - sections of hi gas around a galaxy .",
    "estimates of the gas column density within the beam can be obtained by the ratio of the hi flux to the area covered .",
    "a probe of emission might reveal an average hi column above @xmath7 , however this is over a much larger area than that probed by absorption , therefore there is no guarantee that a qso probe will reveal a dla at every position within the emission beam .",
    "emission - line probes above @xmath7 only say that somewhere they generally exceed the dla limit .",
    "@xcite showed that hi - emission selected galaxies generally show more cross - section at higher column densities than they do at lower column densities and most exhibit column densities that are above the dla limit .",
    "the hi - emission - selected galaxies are consistent with the hypothesis that the local galaxy population can explain the properties of the local dlas .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite studied the expected properties of the z=0 dla population using blind 21  cm emission surveys , and found that , while a large fraction of hi - selected galaxies are dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies , there is no need for an optically invisible population of galaxies to explain the hi population or to contribute significantly to the dla cross section .",
    "there are presently only a small number of ( sub ) dlas or dla candidates known at low - redshift and an even smaller number that have hi measured in emission .",
    "it should be noted that a dla ( and sub - dla ) system is classically defined as a system with an observed @xmath3  atoms  @xmath4 ( @xmath8  @xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath6 @xmath2 @xmath7  @xmath4 ) measured via the ly-@xmath5 absorption line .",
    "the term `` candidate dla '' is used to describe all galaxies that have @xmath3 atoms  @xmath4 measured through other means , or those with no @xmath6 measurement but meet the criteria of various metal - dla relationships ( e.g. mg  ii , ca  ii , na  i ) .",
    "@xcite compared the properties of 20 low - redshift ( z@xmath21 ) dla / sub - dla galaxies with a sample of local , optically selected galaxies studied in hi 21  cm .",
    "only 2 of the 20 dlas , sbs  1543 + 593 and ngc  4203 , have measured hi 21  cm emission .",
    "one other dla , the absorber towards the qso oi  363 , and two sub - dlas , the absorbers towards the qsos pks  0439 - 433 and",
    "pg  1216 + 069 , have been searched for 21  cm emission .",
    "we use the hi observations of these objects , along with the ones reported here , to further investigate the properties of dlas at z=0 and expand on the number of dlas or candidates known at low - z with hi 21  cm emission measurements .",
    "table 1 lists the hi and optical properties of the known / candidate dlas .",
    "a summary of the hi 21  cm observations of these five known / candidate dlas is as follows .",
    "the z=0.009 dwarf galaxy sbs  1543 + 593 has an hi column density of log @xmath6=20.41 @xcite as measured by the lyman  @xmath5 line , while @xcite find a column density of log @xmath9 from the 21  cm emission mapped at the position of the qso .",
    "the z=0.004 s0 galaxy ngc  4203 was first mapped at 21  cm before the presence of the background qso ton  1480 was revealed by x - ray observations .",
    "the hi absorption in the x - ray spectrum of ton  1480 suggests a sufficiently high column density ( log @xmath10 ) to make this system a candidate dla .",
    "another known dla , the z=0.0912 absorber towards b  0738 + 313 ( oi  363 ) , has been searched for 21  cm emission but was undetected @xcite .",
    "two sub - dla s have also been searched for 21  cm emission .",
    "the z=0.101 absorber towards pks  0439 - 433 was thought to be a candidate dla system based on its x - ray spectrum but measurement of the lyman  @xmath5 line @xcite revealed a column density ( log @xmath11 ) just below the limit for dlas and it was undetected in 21  cm emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite report a weak 21  cm emission detection along the line of sight towards the qso pg  1216 + 069 , which is consistent with the velocity of the z=0.0063 sub - dla absorber .    in this paper",
    "we present the 21  cm emission detection of mrk  1456 with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) and of sdss  j211701.26 - 002633.7 with the arecibo telescope .",
    "section 2 describes the sample selection , observations , data reductions and analysis . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the hi properties of our sample and compare them to hi - detected dlas and hi - selected galaxies .",
    "we adopt a cosmology of @xmath12=71  km  @xmath13 , @xmath14=0.27 , @xmath15=0.73 throughout this paper .",
    "a search was made in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) for candidate dlas by cross - referencing _ known spectroscopic galaxies with the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) qso catalog @xcite , creating a subset of galaxy - qso pairs .",
    "the motivation behind this approach was spawned by the difficulty of identifying dla host galaxies at both high and low redshifts .",
    "the galaxy - qso pairs were further trimmed by requiring the impact parameters to be less than twice the petrosian radius of the galaxy , and that @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "twice the petrosian radius was chosen as hi disks have typically been shown to extend anywhere from 1.5 - 2.0 times the optical radius for spiral galaxies @xcite and we adopted this cutoff to ensure inclusion of a significant amount of hi in the matching process . as the sdss is a magnitude limited survey @xcite , our selection method favors giant over dwarf dla candidates and thus may tend to select high hi mass galaxies .",
    "mrk  1456 and sdss  j211701.26 - 002633.7 ( sdss  21 - 00 for brevity ) were selected from this set because the background qsos are within the stellar disks of the galaxy .",
    "mrk  1456 has an impact parameter , b=4.9 kpc , compared with the galaxy s r - band petrosian radius , r=7.1 kpc . for sdss  21 - 00 , b=5.7 kpc while r=7.5 kpc .",
    "these values are both less than the median impact parameters for dla hosts ( b@xmath28.0 kpc ) as found by @xcite .",
    "the sdss redshifts reported for mrk  1456 , mrk  1457 , and sdss  21 - 00 throughout the paper are optical emission line redshifts .",
    "_    mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 were chosen for follow - up hi observations because they are strong dla candidates that are within the redshift limits of hi 21  cm observations .",
    "the beam of our hi observations also included mrk  1457 so we present the data for this galaxy as well .",
    "direct measurement of the damped lyman-@xmath5 line in low - z systems requires uv spectroscopy from space , which has not been carried out on the two qsos in this study .",
    "however , the small qso impact parameters , and the strength of the ca  ii doublets ( @xmath193934,3969 ) in both mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 indicate that they are likely to be dlas . @xcite and",

    "for sdss  21 - 00 , comparison of it s spectrum with the templates of @xcite and using the inverse concentration index and u - r color @xcite suggests that it is an sb type spiral galaxy .",
    "a morphological examination of the optical image for sdss  21 - 00 shows it is a late - type disk galaxy .",
    "mrk  1457 is classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy in ned and lies 2.3 (  2.2 kpc ) south of mrk  1456 .",

    "we find that the o3n2 and n2 derived abundances are in good agreement with each other .",
    "assuming a solar abundance of 8.74@xmath250.08 from @xcite , sdss  21 - 00 has a metallicity near the solar value .",
    "the observations of mrk  1456 were made on 2006 august 27 with the green bank telescope , a 100-m diameter single dish telescope with a fwhm beamwidth of 12.4@xmath36/f(ghz ) .",
    "the l - band gregorian receiver was used , which covers a frequency range of 1.15 - 1.73 ghz , giving a fwhm beamwidth of 9@xmath36 with two linear polarizations .",
    "the gain on the l - band receiver is 2 k / jy .",
    "the backend used was the gbt spectrometer in the narrow bandwidth , high resolution mode .",
    "the spectrometer was set for a 12.5 mhz bandwidth , with 1 spectral window .",
    "9-level sampling was employed to increase sensitivity and to improve the ability to excise radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "the raw spectral resolution was 0.38146 khz over 32768 channels .",
    "we obtained 42 on / off pairs each with a 5 minute integration time resulting in a total integration time of 7 hours , including both signal and reference observations .    to reduce the data we ( 1 ) removed any radio frequency interference ( rfi ) identified by eye in individual scans , ( 2 ) subtracted off a baseline , and ( 3 ) averaged the two polarizations to achieve the final spectrum .",
    "rfi usually presents itself as sharp spikes in the data .",
    "each of the 84 scans was investigated , by eye , for any such spikes and , if found , the bad data were removed . during the rfi removal",
    ", two other problems were discovered in the data , including `` bad lag '' .",
    "`` bad lag '' refers to the incorrect scaling of the raw lags by the spectrometer ( oneil , k. 2006 ) .",
    "each record , 2.5 seconds of data , where this `` bad lag '' occured were removed from the scan .",
    "in addition , when the power spectrum of the data was analyzed , we found a sharp peak at a frequency corresponding to a standing wave on the antenna .",
    "the standing wave arises from light that is reflected back and forth between the reflector and the panel gaps on the telescope @xcite .",
    "due to these standing waves , fourteen scans ( 140 minutes ) , were removed from the 1st polarization and eight scans ( 80 minutes ) were removed from the 2nd polarization .",
    "once the bad data were removed , a 3rd , 5th , or 7th order polynomial was fit to each scan and subtracted .",
    "after the subtraction of the baseline , each scan was then hanning smoothed and then further smoothed with a 500 channel ( 45 km @xmath37 ) boxcar filter . after smoothing the data , a weighted average of all of the scans in both polarizations was computed .",
    "each scan is assigned a weight based on it s antenna temperature , exposure time , and frequency resolution .",
    "since an entire scan gets a single weight , the channels in a scan that were flagged for rfi removal have an incorrect weighting value for those channels . because data in the flagged channels are removed but not down - weighted , they still contribute some noise to the average spectrum . however , the number of flagged channels for rfi removal in each scan is small enough that it does not cause any noticeable effects in the final averaging .",
    "the final spectrum is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the data for sdss 21 - 00 were taken with the 305 m diameter arecibo telescope on 2006 october 27 on the l - band wide receiver and the interim 50 mhz correlator .",
    "the correlator was configured for 9-level sampling in 2 linear polarizations with four boards .",
    "two of the boards were centered on the 1420.4058 mhz line of neutral hydrogen while the other two boards were centered on the 1667.359 and 1720.530 mhz oh lines .",
    "radio frequency interference was too strong at these higher frequencies to make use of the oh observations .",
    "for the hi observations , the center frequency was set to 1338.147 mhz , the expected emission frequency of the galaxy .",
    "one board was set up with a 25 mhz bandwidth while the other was set - up with a 6.25 mhz bandwidth . in both cases",
    "there were 2048 lags per board resulting in velocity resolutions of 2.9 and 0.7 km @xmath37 respectively , before hanning smoothing .",
    "prior to the beginning of observations a test scan was taken on a blank sky position that showed emission from the 1350/1330 mhz faa radar .",
    "because of this emission , the radar blanker was used during the observations which reduces the effective integration times by approximately a factor of 1/1.188 .",
    "the observations of the source consist of 4 on / off observations of 5 minutes each .",
    "each resulting on / off pair was combined , hanning smoothed and a baseline was fit to the result and subtracted . the eight spectra  4 on / off pairs with 2 polarizations each ",
    "were then averaged and an additional second order polynomial was subtracted from the resulting spectrum .",
    "an additional boxcar smoothing of 25 channels or 18.1 km @xmath37 was applied to the spectrum .",
    "the final spectrum is shown in figure 2 .",
    "two signals were detected in the gbt observations of mrk  1456 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "both signals show the typical double - horned profile as expected from an inclined disk galaxy .",
    "one signal is located at the frequency 1.35587@xmath250.00003 ghz , and corresponds to a redshift of 0.04759@xmath250.00002 , which matches the sdss redshift of mrk  1456 ( 0.04757@xmath250.00008 ) within the errors .",
    "the second signal , located at the frequency 1.3544@xmath250.0001 , corresponds to a redshift of 0.04873@xmath250.00008 , which matches the position and redshift of mrk  1457 ( sdss redshift 0.04857@xmath250.00009 ) .",
    "mrk  1457 is located about 2.3 south of mrk  1456 .",
    "given the beamwidth of 9 , we note that two other members , mrk  1458 and sdss  j114711.09 + 522653.4 , located at frequencies of 1.35517 ghz ( 14442 km @xmath37 ) and 1.35574 ghz ( 14310 km @xmath37 ) respectively , are also within the beam .",
    "examination of the spectrum in figure 1 shows that mrk  1458 falls in the gap between mrk  1456 and mrk  1457 , where the hi flux falls to zero .",
    "sdss  j114711.09 + 522653.4 falls in the middle of the signal of mrk  1456 .",
    "as there is no way to disentangle the two signals , there may be some contribution of hi from sdss  j114711.09 + 522653.4 .",
    "however , sdss  j114711.09 + 522653.4 is an e / s0 galaxy that is 2.8 from mrk  1456 ( the beam center ) , so we expect the contribution to the hi flux to be small .",
    "the regular shape of the spectrum also indicates that this is the case .",
    "the task gmeasure in gbtidl was used to measure the integrated flux , s(v)dv , in @xmath38 , the velocity width w , and systematic velocity of the galaxy profile .",
    "the rms noise in the data was taken as the error in the flux .",
    "the results of the analysis are shown in table 3 .",
    "hi mass was determined from the data using @xcite @xmath39 where d is the luminosity distance in mpc ( see table 2 ) , and s(v)dv is the flux integrated over the line in @xmath40 .",
    "we include flux and distance errors on the hi mass measurement in table 3 .",
    "we estimate the dynamical mass from @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xcite , @xmath43 is the sdss r - band petrosian radius , and @xmath44 is the rotational velocity , estimated by @xmath45 , where i here is the optical inclination of the galaxy .",

    "our observations of mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 have added two candidate dla galaxies with morphologies and luminosities of giant late - type spirals .",
    "thus they are most directly comparable to the galaxy toward pks  0439 - 433 , also a late - type giant spiral .",
    "the pks galaxy is an sab class sub - dla with an hi column just below the dla limit , and an impact parameter that is just outside its stellar disk .",
    "given that hi column densities are higher at lower radii and in later morphological subtypes , we expect that future observations on the qso sightlines of mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 might reveal hi column densities larger than the dla limit , as both are later subtypes than the pks galaxy and both have sightlines to their qsos that lie inside their stellar disks .",
    "the properties of mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 agree within the distributions of expected optical properties of z=0 dlas .",
    "@xcite found that sbs 1543 + 593 is in a small galaxy group with three other companions , a disk galaxy and two dwarfs , all of which are of low luminosity .",
    "all three companions are gas rich systems , with low hi mass ( @xmath54 ) , and average gas content for disk and late - type dwarf galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) .",
    "this group , and other small groups like it , are likely to be fairly common and important in the contribution to the dla population .",
    "furthermore , if young , gas - rich galaxy groups are more prevalent at higher redshifts , then these systems might be important to the dla cross - section . from a search using the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ,",
    "none of the other dlas that have been observed in 21  cm have associated groups , but faint dwarfs could have been missed .",
    "@xcite completed a sample of galaxy groups in the dr3 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "mrk  1456 is in one such group , with four other members .",
    "mrk  1457 is one such member .",
    "all other galaxies in the group are contained within the beam of the gbt , centered on mrk  1456 , but mrk  1457 was the only other member to be detected in hi 21  cm emission .",
    "@xcite also show that sdss  21 - 00 is in a group , consisting of seven other members .",
    "table 4 lists a few global properties of the group , ie .",
    "the group coordinates , group systematic velocity , group velocity width , virial mass and radius of the group , as calculated by @xcite and table 5 lists each group s members and their properties .",
    "as both galaxies are situated in groups , the question of misidentification of the dla host galaxy becomes an issue .",
    "traditionally , identifying dla hosts has proven difficult since either no obvious galaxy is visible or identifying the correct host in a group is difficult as the galaxy giving rise to the line may not be the brightest or closest galaxy to the qso .",
    "this is not an issue with mrk  1456 or sdss  21 - 00 .",
    "for both systems , the qso lies within the stellar disk of the galaxy , and in both groups , the closest companion outside the named galaxy here lies more than 120 kpc from the qso .    without hi observations of the galaxies in these groups , it is hard to determine the richness of the group and the environment these galaxies live in .",
    "we use u - r color and morphological type as a rough indicator of the gas content of the other galaxies in these groups .",
    "the reliability , however , of using optical properties as a predictor of gas content is uncertain as hi - selected galaxies differ more in their optical properties than optically - selected ones , the exception being the most blue galaxies , as they have retained most of their primordial gas .",
    "figure 5 shows how galaxies of different morphologies segregate in color and concentration .",
    "we plot the galaxies from @xcite overlaid with the mrk  1456 group ( black circles ) and the sdss  21 - 00 group ( black diamonds ) .",
    "the galaxies in the mrk  1456 group , with the exception of mrk  1456 , fall in the region of the diagram occupied by early types .",
    "the galaxies in the sdss  21 - 00 galaxy group , on the other hand , are predominantly sb - sc morphological types with only two e / s0 galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that there is a relationship between u - r color and gas richness .",
    "galaxies with u - r @xmath2 1.5 are gas - rich , 1.5 @xmath2 u - r @xmath2 2.5 are intermediate in gas richness , and those with u - r @xmath17 2.5 are generally gas - poor .",
    "the u - r colors of the galaxies in the two galaxy groups are listed in table 5 .",
    "these results indicate that both the mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 galaxy groups are intermediate in their gas - richness .",
    "the total hi mass of all 4 galaxies detected in the sbs  1543 + 593 galaxy group adds up to @xmath23@xmath55 . with two of four galaxies detected in the mrk  1456 group ,",
    "its hi content is already much larger , @xmath2312@xmath55 . the single galaxy detected in the sdss  21 - 00 galaxy group has an hi mass of @xmath5614@xmath55 , much larger than the entire sbs  1543 + 593 galaxy group .",
    "@xcite used sdss to identify optical counterparts of hi - selected galaxies from hipass and found that hi - selection yields a high fraction of late - type galaxies . for hi - selected spirals , @xcite give the following median properties : @xmath47 = 0.5 , @xmath57 = @xmath0 , and @xmath58 = 0.6 @xmath29 .",
    "our ca  ii absorbing galaxies appear to have properties that are comparable to those of hi - selected galaxies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also looked at hi - selected galaxies , and focused more specifically on the question of how these contribute to the dla cross - section .",
    "@xcite find a tight correlation between the expected dla cross - section and the hi mass .",
    "their equation 3 predicts the following dla cross - sections for mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 : 853.7 @xmath59 and 2058.4 @xmath59 . using these sizes to estimate the average column density for the galaxies , we find for mrk  1456 , @xmath60 , and for sdss  21 - 00 , @xmath61 .",
    "rosenberg @xmath62 salzer ( in prep . ) looked at the predicted optical properties for z=0 dlas from an hi - selected sample and find that the most common morphological type is spiral ( 45@xmath24 ) and that 50@xmath24 of the dlas should have an @xmath47 @xmath17 0.77 ( 2 of the 6 galaxies from the rosenberg @xmath62 salzer ( in prep . ) sample are from this sample ) .",
    "@xcite also find that gas - rich , late - type spirals contribute most to the dla cross - section .",
    "figure 4 shows the hi mass contribution to dn / dz , the number of expected systems per unit redshift , for z@xmath230 , for a sample of hi - selected galaxies with an hi column larger than the dla limit from the arecibo dual - beam survey ( adbs , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the figure shows that 50@xmath24 of the cross - sectional area is from galaxies with hi masses between 2.9@xmath63 and 3.5@xmath64 .",
    "the red - hatched histogram overlayed on top is the hi mass distribution of the objects listed in tables 1 and 2 , with the exception of the oi  363 absorber .",
    "the right hand axis lists the values for this histogram , n , the number of galaxies .",
    "one might expect the hi mass distribution of dlas in general to follow the same hi mass distribution of hi - selected galaxies expected to be dlas .",
    "it should be noted that the two galaxy / qso pairs we add here were not selected using the traditional selection method for quasar absorption line systems , ie . through uv absorption lines .",
    "thus , they introduce some bias in the hi mass distribution as they are giant spirals optically - selected from sdss with quasars projected within their stellar disks",
    ". however , even with this caveat and low statistics , it appears the hi mass distribution of the ( candidate ) dlas mimics the distribution of hi - selected galaxies expected to be dlas .",
    "@xcite looked at an optically - selected sample of the local galaxy population ( z@xmath230 ) , mapped in 21  cm emission , in order to connect them to the low - redshift ( z@xmath21 ) dla population and calculated expected probability distribution functions of different properties for the low - redshift dlas .",
    "they find that , for expected dla systems , most will be late - type , with a median impact parameter of 8.0 kpc@xmath65 , median log @xmath57 of 9.3@xmath66 , and median @xmath1=-17.98@xmath67 .",
    "mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 are indeed late - types within the range for the expected impact parameter and have values for hi mass and absolute magnitude that lie close to the expected values , on the high end .",
    "we report on the hi 21  cm emission observations of two galaxies , mrk  1456 and sdss  j211701.26 - 002633.7 .",
    "both are average disk galaxies and candidate dlas , based on the strengths of their ca  ii  k ew s and their low impact parameters to the qso . in terms of their hi properties ,",
    "both galaxies have typical hi properties for their morphological types with @xmath57 @xmath23 @xmath0 , average gas richness , and gas mass fractions that are representative of disk galaxies .    these data",
    "add to the total number of strong candidate dlas with hi observations , in the local universe .",
    "compared with other hi - detected dlas , mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 are similar in most respects , with comparatively higher hi masses . when compared to the expected properties of z=0 dlas from hi - detected galaxies , we find that mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 fall within range of the expected hi mass distribution , median impact parameter , and absolute magnitudes for local dlas .",
    "we also find that both mrk  1456 and sdss  21 - 00 reside in groups , adding two dlas in gas - rich groups to the known population .",
    "this may indicate a common phenomenon with regards to the environment of dlas .    in spite of many years of observational effort ,",
    "associated galaxies have only been identified in a very small fraction of known dla systems .",
    "therefore , the nature of the evolving dla galaxy population has continued to be under investigation , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "historically , two very different scenarios were developed to explain what kind of galaxies produce dlas . in the explanation put forth by @xcite ,",
    "dlas are associated with massive spiral galaxies . in the model proposed by @xcite , dlas instead arise in low - mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "the numerical and semi - analytical galaxy formation simulations presented over the last decade have modified our view of dlas .",
    "current models suggest that the median properties of dla galaxies and their range evolve as a function of cosmic time . in this scenario , dwarfs make up most of the dla cross - section at high redshifts , with massive disk galaxies contributing more as the universe evolves .",
    "@xcite find that higher mass systems make an increasing contribution to the dla population as redshift decreases .",
    "specifically , @xcite predict a median dla hydrogen mass of @xmath57 = 2@xmath68 @xmath69 at z=0 ; in good agreement with the results for hi - selected galaxies @xcite , and what we find here ( cf . fig .  4 ) .",
    "thus , although mrk 1456 and sdss  21 - 00 are case studies of bright qsos seen through the disks of nearby spiral galaxies , we do not conclude that they support the original @xcite picture .",
    "rather , we interpret our results to be compatible with the current theoretical models , as galaxies contributing to the fraction of disk galaxies that make up the dla cross - section at low redshift .",
    "we conclude that our result further strengthens the picture that the local galaxy population , in its variety of gas rich galaxy types that randomly intercept qso sightlines , can explain the properties of the low - redshift dlas .",
