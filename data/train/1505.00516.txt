    "in the last two decades , much effort has been devoted to accurate determination of the band offsets and polarization fields in group iii - nitride semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "@xcite these material characteristics along with parameters of the bulk semiconductors are crucial elements of the band structure engineering of modern electronic and optoelectronic devices .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , it is tacitly supposed that the knowledge of the band offsets and polarization fields provides rather accurate description of the effective potential of a heterojunction .",
    "can the simple model of a step - like crystal potential be defective ?",
    "zhu and kroemer were apparently the first to give a detailed analysis of the potential of an abrupt heterojunction to be used in the effective - mass ( em ) equations .",
    "@xcite they showed that the heterojunction can be described by a potential step to represent the band offset and a heterointerface potential in the form of a dirac delta function , the strength of which is subject to the details of the heterointerface on an atomic scale .",
    "this result of the tight - binding model has later been confirmed by consistent application of the @xmath0 method , @xcite with the only input quantity , other than parameters of bulk materials , being a phenomenological coordinate - dependent form - factor @xmath1 , see fig .",

    "the transition region of the junction is @xmath2 , so that @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    ", width=226 ]    contrary to what one might expect , the interface potential of a heterojunction is not formally represented by a space derivative of the function @xmath1 .",
    "briefly , its origin can be traced as follows .",
    "the form - factor can be decomposed into a gentle part , processed by using the standard technique of the em approximation for slowly varying perturbations , @xcite and a rapidly varying part , the space extent of which @xmath2 is supposed to be small on a scale of the wavelength @xmath5 of the envelope function ( ef ) .",
    "the rapidly varying part can be processed in the spirit of the approach presented by bir and pikus ( * ? ? ?",
    "27 ) for the central - cell corrections in the problem of shallow impurity levels in bulk semiconductors .",
    "this rapidly varying part can accordingly be formulated as a convergent series of interface - localized generalized functions , @xcite each successive term contributing less than the previous one in the parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lattice constant .",
    "it is the leading term of the series that gives rise to the delta - function potential of zhu and kroemer .",
    "the strength of the interface potentials not only depend on the microscopic details of the heterointerface but also on the orientation of the structure s growth direction with respect to the crystal axes .",
    "@xcite    zhu and kroemer pointed out that the heterointerface terms were small or negligible for gaaa / algaas heterojunctions but might be strong in other semiconductor systems .",
    "@xcite since then , there have been obtained no experimental evidences of the existence of the diagonal in the band index interface potentials , which couple states of the same type .",
    "it is not surprising because even if they are present and properly included into the em equations , the potentials do not modify symmetry but merely spectrum of the system , which may have been misinterpreted in terms of adjusted em parameters or band offsets . on the other hand",
    ", the interface potentials can also produce interband couplings , which , though generally weaker than the intraband ones , are easily identified by unique effects they produce .",
    "thus it has been shown for @xmath8$]-grown zinc - blende heterostructures that the interface terms are responsible for such phenomena as the intervalley @xmath9-@xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11-@xmath12 @xcite mixing of the conduction band states , mixing of light and heavy holes at the center of the two - dimensional brillouin zone , @xcite and also anisotropy of the interband optical transitions @xcite and a twofold anisotropy of the in - plane spectrum of the conduction band electrons in asymmetric quantum wells .",
    "@xcite    here we will ignore the rapidly varying part of the function @xmath1 to focus on another type of the interface potential , not considered so far , that is missing in zinc - blende heterostructures but present in wurtzite ones . it is proportional to a derivative of the form - factor @xmath1 and is thus finite even for structures with graded chemical composition where the rapidly varying part of the function @xmath1 produces an exponentially small contribution ( * ? ?",
    "let us consider a heterostructure composed of two semiconductors , so that the single - particle potential energy of an electron is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the periodic lattice potential of the nominally basis ( potential well ) material , while @xmath15 is the perturbative periodic potential and @xmath16 is the periodic potential of the barrier material . we suppose that the phenomenological function @xmath17 takes values of the order of unity or less even at the heterointerfaces .",
    "@xcite ideally , @xmath18 can even be a step - like function so that @xmath19 in the region of the potential well material and @xmath20 in the region of the barrier material .",
    "@xcite we also suppose that the semiconductors composing the structure are related , which means that @xmath21 can be treated as a small perturbation as compared to the basis potential @xmath22 .",
    "we do not consider in details deformation effects appearing in lattice - mismatched pairs , which would lead to redundant complications , not essential for our results .",
    "we suppose that an inhomogeneous coordinate transformation restoring the unstrained lattice of the basis material and adjusting the lattice of the barrier material to that of the basis one has been performed , @xcite so that in the transformed space both materials are described by the same lattice constant .",
    "the strain - induced piezoelectric field and the spontaneous polarization field are taken into account via the inclusion of an external scalar potential @xmath23 , while the strain modification of the band edge energies and the band offsets can be accounted for by using the strain hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite for brevity , the latter as well as the spin - orbit interaction are considered only schematically . the strain - induced change in the matrix elements of the momentum operator @xmath24 between bloch states , being small in the parameter of the order of strain ( several percent typically ) , is neglected .",
    "dealing with states near the brillouin zone center , it is convenient to use the complete set of kohn - luttinger functions , @xcite with the unit - cell orthonormalized periodic parts @xmath25 , which are chosen real , specified as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the free electron mass and @xmath28 is the band edge energy of the @xmath29th band for the potential well material .",
    "we also introduce here zone - center bloch functions @xmath30 and the band edge energies @xmath31 for the barrier material : @xmath32 treating @xmath21 as a perturbation , @xcite we have the following approximate expressions for the band edge energies : @xmath33 and for the band edge bloch functions : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",

    "indeed , it takes place for @xmath9 point states in cubic crystals but not in wurtzite ones .",
