    "@xmath0-frieze patterns have been considered for the first time in @xcite with a slightly more special definition . meanwhile , many papers have treated different types of @xmath0-patterns .",
    "let us shortly recapitulate some definitions and results .",
    "let @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "an _ @xmath0-frieze pattern _ ( or _",
    "_ @xmath0-frieze__for short ) is an array @xmath11 of the form @xmath12 where there are @xmath13 zeros on the left and right in each row , @xmath14 are numbers in some field , and such that every ( complete ) adjacent @xmath4 submatrix has determinant @xmath5",
    ". it may be convenient to extend the pattern to the right and to the left by repeating the rows ; in this case one has to multiply every second repetition by @xmath15 : @xmath16    we call @xmath17 the _ height _ of @xmath11 .",
    "we call the frieze @xmath11    * _ integral _ if all @xmath14 are in @xmath18 , * _ non - zero _ if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , * _ positive _ if all @xmath14 are positive real numbers , * _ periodic _ if there exists an @xmath21 such that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and @xmath24 , * _ _ specialized__if any adjacent @xmath8 submatrix not containing too many zeros from the border has nonzero determinant , * _ tame _ if all adjacent @xmath7 submatrices have determinant @xmath25 , * _ wild _ if it is not tame",
    ".    sometimes it will be useful to view the extended @xmath11 as a matrix @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and thus @xmath28 .    1 .",
    "conway - coxeter friezes are exactly the integral positive @xmath29-friezes .",
    "they are all tame , specialized , and periodic .",
    "2 .   extending the array @xmath30 periodically ( in all directions ) we obtain a tame integral positive @xmath1-frieze .",
    "it has been proved several times in the literature that tame friezes are periodic , see for example @xcite .",
    "the main reason is ( compare @xcite ) : let @xmath32 be a tame @xmath0-friezeand denote @xmath33 then the matrices @xmath34 are all equal for fixed @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and they are of the form @xmath37 where the last column has alternating signs and @xmath38 if the frieze is positive .",
    "since @xmath11 is tame , it is periodic with period @xmath39 . thus the sequence of @xmath40 is periodic , and @xmath41 .",
    "further , the complete frieze pattern is uniquely determined by this sequence of @xmath40 , thus by a sequence of @xmath39 tuples of the form @xmath42 .",
    "an interesting question concerning tame friezes is :    there are only finitely many tame integral positive @xmath1-friezes of height @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , the number of such friezes could be @xmath44 .",
    "notice that there are only finitely many tame integral positive @xmath29-friezes ( see for example @xcite ) , that there are only finitely many tame integral positive @xmath1-friezes of height less than @xmath43 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 of heights @xmath48 resp . ) , but that there are infinitely many tame integral positive @xmath1-friezes of height greater than @xmath43 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "notice also that the examples in section [ wfp ] show that there are infinitely many wild integral positive @xmath0-friezes of a fixed height .",
    "the ( apparently ) most useful identity in the context of @xmath0-friezesis sylvester s identity : if we denote @xmath49 the determinant of the @xmath50 adjacent submatrix at position @xmath51 in the array @xmath52 ( i.e.  @xmath53 ) , then @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( assume @xmath56 ) .",
    "[ cornerpos ] if @xmath57 are positive , then @xmath58 is positive as well .",
    "specialized@xmath0-friezesare tame by equation ( [ impeq ] ) for @xmath59 : @xmath60    if @xmath11 is a specialized@xmath0-frieze , then it is uniquely determined by any sequence of @xmath13 successive rows .",
    "if we choose @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 to be transcendent and algebraically independent , then @xmath11 is specialized .",
    "replacing every entry @xmath64 in @xmath11 by @xmath65 we obtain the _ dual _ frieze @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath11 is tame , then @xmath66 is a transposed , translated copy of @xmath11 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . thus :    a tame frieze is specializedif and only if it is nonzero .",
    "but is there a tame frieze which is not specialized ?",
    "yes :    extending the array @xmath67 periodically ( in all directions ) we obtain a tame but not specializedintegral @xmath1-frieze .",
    "the following lemma ( together with the fact that tame friezes are periodic ) generalizes the main result of @xcite .    if @xmath11 is an @xmath0-friezesuch that @xmath68 then @xmath11 is specialized(and thus tame and periodic ) .",
    "it suffices to prove ( see ( i ) and ( ii ) below ) that ( [ lemass ] ) holds for the next sequence of @xmath13 rows of the pattern : induction then gives @xmath69 for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "but then ( [ lemass ] ) also holds for the frieze given by @xmath73 .",
    "the same argument thus shows that @xmath69 for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and all @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , the case @xmath74 implies that @xmath11 is specialized .",
    "\\(i ) let @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are positive by ( [ lemass ] ) ( where @xmath79 if @xmath59 ) , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 because it is on the border of the frieze .",
    "thus by corollary [ cornerpos ] for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath75 , we get @xmath84 .",
    "induction over @xmath85 yields @xmath86 for @xmath87 as well ( notice that we always have @xmath81 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) but then we can move to the next entries to the right , @xmath88 , @xmath89 : as before , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are positive by ( [ lemass ] ) , and @xmath93 by the induction in ( i ) .",
    "hence by an induction over @xmath35 and for each @xmath35 an induction over @xmath85 ( like in ( i ) ) we obtain @xmath94 for all @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "are there wild @xmath0-friezes ? yes :        but what about non - periodic wild friezes ?",
    "the key difference between tame and wild friezes is : if @xmath11 is a wild @xmath0-frieze , then there exist @xmath13 successive rows which do not uniquely determine the following row by the @xmath0-condition .",
    "this happens if and only if some adjacent @xmath8 submatrix within these rows has determinant zero .",
    "define a directed graph @xmath98 which has the set of @xmath99-tuples of vectors in @xmath100 as vertices and such that two tuples @xmath101 and @xmath102 are connected by an edge @xmath103 if @xmath104 and if @xmath105 satisfy the @xmath0-condition when embedded into a frieze .      in this example , @xmath106 .",
    "we choose @xmath107 vertices in the graph @xmath108 : let @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 now putting the pieces @xmath115 together , where successive pieces overlap with one row and according to the following subgraph of @xmath108 ,          wild friezes really are wild . figure [ fig_wildgraphs ] consists of two further examples of subgraphs of @xmath98 .",
    "every closed path corresponds to a periodic integral positive @xmath1-frieze .",
    "as above , we may construct infinitely many non periodic friezes from these pictures .",
    "( of course , we have omitted a list of the corresponding vertices . )",
    "we now display a @xmath1-frieze which is integral , positive , not periodic , and with unbounded entries .",
    "let @xmath119 , and denote by @xmath120 the array displayed in figure [ q0q1 ] where the entries @xmath121 are given in figure [ entri ] .",
    "see figure [ q0q1 ] for examples .",
    "one can check that concatenating @xmath137 produces an integral , positive @xmath1-frieze in which the entries increase without limit .",
    "the integrality comes from the fact that the above formulas are expressions for integral recursions . for example",
    ", @xmath138 satisfies @xmath139    we computed this example with the following technique .",
    "start with an arbitrary vertex in @xmath98 and successively construct adjacent vertices ( with entries within a certain bound ) .",
    "this will produce a graph with loops and many branches .",
    "some of them turn out to be leaves or `` dead ends '' ( at least we find no continuation within the bounds ) . now , after removing some dead ends , we look for a longest path in our constructed subgraph .",
    "then we look for a pattern among the vertices on the path ."
