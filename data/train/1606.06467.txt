    "blind quantum computing is a secure delegated quantum computing where a client ( alice ) who does not have enough quantum technology delegates her quantum computing to a server ( bob ) who has a universal quantum computer without leaking any information about her quantum computing . by using measurement - based quantum computing  @xcite , broadbent , fitzsimons , and",
    "kashefi first showed that blind quantum computing is indeed possible for a client who can do only the single qubit state generation  @xcite . since the breakthrough ,",
    "many theoretical improvements have been obtained  @xcite , and even a proof - of - principle experiment was achieved with photonic qubits  @xcite .",
    "these blind quantum computing protocols guarantee two properties : first , if bob is honest , alice can obtain the correct result of her quantum computing ( correctness ) .",
    "second , whatever bob does , he can not gain any information about alice s quantum computing ( blindness )  @xcite .    in stead of the single - qubit state generation ,",
    "the ability of single - qubit measurements is also enough for alice : it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that alice who can do only single - qubit measurements can perform blind quantum computing .",
    "the idea is that bob generates a graph state and sends each qubit one by one to alice .",
    "if bob is honest , he generates the correct graph state and therefore alice can perform the correct measurement - based quantum computing ( correctness ) . if bob is malicious , he might send a wrong state to alice , but whatever bob sends to alice , alice s measurement angles , which contain information about alice s computation , can not be transmitted to bob due to the no - signaling principle ( blindness ) .",
    "the protocol is called the measurement - only protocol , since alice needs only measurements .",
    "a problem in all these protocols is the lack of the verifiability : although the blindness guarantees that bob can not learn alice s quantum computing , he can still deviate from the correct procedure , mess up her quantum computing , and give alice a completely wrong result . since alice can not perform quantum computing by herself , she can not check the correctness of the result by herself unless the problem is , say , in np , and therefore she can accept a wrong result . to solve the problem , verifiable blind quantum computing protocol was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and some theoretical improvements were also obtained  @xcite .",
    "experimental demonstrations of the verification were also done  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of these protocols is so called the trap technique : alice hides some trap qubits in the register , and any change of a trap signals bob s malicious behavior . by checking traps",
    ", alice can detect any bob s malicious behavior with high probability .",
    "if the computation is encoded by a quantum error detection code , the probability that alice is fooled by bob can be exponentially small , since in that case in order to change the logical state , bob has to touch many qubits , and it consequently increases the probability that bob touches some traps .    recently , a new verification protocol that does not use the trap technique was proposed  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this protocol",
    ", bob generates a graph state , and sends each qubit of it one by one to alice .",
    "alice directly verifies the correctness of the graph state ( and therefore the correctness of the computation ) sent from bob by measuring stabilizer operators .",
    "this verification technique is called the stabilizer test .",
    "note that the stabilizer test is useful also in quantum interactive proof system  @xcite .",
    "although computing itself is verifiable through the stabilizer test , the input is not if it is a quantum state whose classical efficient description is not known to alice .",
    "for example , let us assume that alice receives a state @xmath0 from charlie , and she wants to apply a unitary @xmath1 on @xmath0 .",
    "if she delegates the quantum computation to bob in the measurement - only style , a possible procedure is as follows .",
    "alice first sends @xmath0 to bob .",
    "bob next entangles @xmath0 to the graph state .",
    "bob then sends each qubit of the state one by one to alice , and alice does measurement - based quantum computing on it .",
    "if bob is honest , alice can realize @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , as is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , alice can verify the correctness of the graph state by using the stabilizer test even if some states are coupled to the graph state .",
    "however , in the procedure , the correctness of the input state is not guaranteed , since bob does not necessarily couple @xmath0 to the graph state , and alice can not check the correctness of the input state .",
    "bob might discard @xmath0 and entangles completely different state @xmath3 to the graph state . in this case",
    "what alice obtains is not @xmath2 but @xmath4 .",
    "can alice verify that bob honestly coupled her input state to the graph state ?    in this paper , we introduce a new protocol of measurement - only verifiable blind quantum computing where not only the computation itself but also the quantum input are verifiable . our strategy is to combine the trap technique and the stabilizer test .",
    "the correctness of the computing is verified by the stabilizer test , and the correctness of the quantum input is verified by checking the trap qubits that are randomly hidden in the input state .",
    "when the traps are checked , the state can be isolated from the graph state by measuring the connecting qubits in @xmath5 basis .",
    "the main technical challenge in our proof is to show that the trap verification and the stabilizer verification can coexist with each other .",
    "we first review the stabilizer test .",
    "let us consider an @xmath6-qubit state @xmath7 and a set @xmath8 of generators of a stabilizer group .",
    "the stabilizer test is a following test :    * randomly generate an @xmath9-bit string @xmath10 .",
    "* measure the operator @xmath11 note that this measurement can be done with single - qubit measurements , since @xmath12 is a tensor product of pauli operators .",
    "* if the result is @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , the test passes ( fails ) .",
    "the probability of passing the stabilizer test is @xmath15 we can show that if the probability of passing the test is high , @xmath16 , then @xmath7 is  close \" to a certain stabilized state @xmath17 in the sense of @xmath18 for any povm element @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath16 , we obtain @xmath20 let @xmath21 from the gentle measurement lemma  @xcite , @xmath22 note that @xmath23 for any @xmath24 , and therefore , @xmath25 is a stabilized state .    for any positive operator @xmath19 , @xmath26 which means @xmath27 and , for any positive operator @xmath19 , @xmath28 which means @xmath29",
    "now we explain our protocol and analyze it , which is the main result of the present paper .",
    "let us consider the following situation : alice possesses an @xmath30-qubit state @xmath0 , but she neither knows its classical description nor a classical description of a quantum circuit that efficiently generates the state .",
    "( for example , she just receives @xmath0 from her friend charlie , etc . ) she wants to perform a polynomial - size quantum computing @xmath1 on the input @xmath0 , but she can not do it by herself .",
    "she therefore asks bob , who is very powerful but not trusted , to perform her quantum computing .",
    "we show that alice can delegate her quantum computing to bob without revealing @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and she can verify the correctness of the computation and input .    for simplicity , we assume that alice wants to solve a decision problem @xmath31 .",
    "alice measures the output qubit of @xmath2 in the computational basis , and accepts ( rejects ) if the result is 1 ( 0 ) . as usual",
    ", we assume that for any yes instance @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , the acceptance probability is larger than @xmath34 , and for any no instance @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath35 , the acceptance probability is smaller than @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "our protocol runs as follows :    * alice randomly chooses a @xmath38-qubit permutation @xmath39 , and applies it on @xmath40 .",
    "alice further chooses a random @xmath41-bit string @xmath42 , and applies @xmath43 on @xmath44 to generate @xmath45 she sends @xmath46 to bob .",
    "( or , it is reasonable to assume that charlie gives alice @xmath46 and information of @xmath39 and @xmath47 in stead of giving @xmath0 . ) * if bob is honest , he generates the @xmath48-qubit state @xmath49 and sends each qubit of it one by one to alice , where @xmath50 is the cz gate on the vertices of the edge @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the set of edges that connects qubits in @xmath53 and @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "if bob is malicious , he sends any @xmath48-qubit state @xmath7 to alice . * * * with probability @xmath54 , which is specified later , alice does the measurement - based quantum computing on qubits sent from bob . if the computation result is accept ( reject ) , she accepts ( rejects ) .",
    "( during the computation , alice of course corrects the initial random pauli operator and permutation @xmath55 . ) * * with probability @xmath56 , alice does the stabilizer test , and if she passes ( fails ) the test , she accepts ( rejects ) . * * with probability @xmath56 , alice does the following test , which we call the input - state test : let @xmath57 and @xmath58 be the set of qubits in the red dotted box and the blue dotted box in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , respectively .",
    "alice stores qubits in @xmath58 in her memory , and measures each qubit in @xmath57 in @xmath5 basis .",
    "if the @xmath5-basis measurement result on the nearest - neighbour of @xmath24th vertex in @xmath58 is 1 , alice applies @xmath5 on the @xmath24th vertex in @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "if bob was honest , the state of @xmath58 is now @xmath60 on @xmath58 .",
    "if bob was honest , the state of @xmath58 is now @xmath61 , on the last @xmath62 qubits of @xmath58 .",
    "if she gets @xmath63 , she accepts .",
    "otherwise , she rejects .    .",
    "the state in the red dotted box is @xmath53 and that in the blue dotted box is @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath52 is the set of edges that connects qubits in the red dotted box and those in the blue dotted box .",
    ", scaledwidth=20.0% ]    now let us analyze the protocol .",
    "first , the blindness is obvious , since what she sends to bob is the completely - mixed state from bob s view point , and due to the no - signaling principle , alice s operations on states sent from bob do not transmit any information to bob .",
    "second , let us consider the case of @xmath33 . in this case , honest bob generates the correct state , @xmath64 , eq .",
    "( [ honestbob ] ) , and therefore alice can do correct computation , if she chooses the measurement - based quantum computing , passes the stabilizer test with probability 1 , if she chooses the stabilizer test , and passes the input - state test with probability 1 , if she chooses the input - state test .",
    "the acceptance probability , @xmath65 , is @xmath66    finally , let us consider the case of @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", bob might be malicious , and can send any @xmath48-qubit state @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath67 and @xmath68 be the probability of passing the stabilizer test and the initial - state test , respectively .",
    "let @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to see that the acceptance probability , @xmath70 , is given as follows :    * if @xmath71 and @xmath72 , then @xmath73 * if @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then @xmath76 * if @xmath74 and @xmath72 , then @xmath77    let us consider the remaining case , @xmath71 and @xmath75 . from the triangle inequality and the invariance of the trace norm under a unitary operation , we obtain @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath17 is any @xmath38-qubit state on @xmath58 . since @xmath81 , the first term is upperbounded as @xmath82 from eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) .",
    "we can show that if @xmath75 , the second term is upperbounded as @xmath83 the proof is given in appendix .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath84 which means @xmath85 for the povm element @xmath86 corresponding to the acceptance of the measurement - based quantum computing .",
    "therefore , the total acceptance probability , @xmath70 , is @xmath87    let us define @xmath88 the optimal value @xmath89 of @xmath54 is that satisfies @xmath90 .",
