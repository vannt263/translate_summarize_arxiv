    "the energy spectrum @xmath0 describes the distribution of energy over the wave - number ( @xmath1 ) scales in a turbulent fluid ; it is , therefore , an important statistical measure of the characteristics of fluid turbulence . in three - dimensional ( 3d )",
    "fluid turbulence , energy , injected at @xmath2 , cascades down to small length scales ( @xmath3 ) , because of the nonlinearities in the system , and leads to the scaling form @xmath4 , in the inertial range @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and the kolmogorov dissipation length scale is @xmath7 ; at the level of kolmogorov s  @xcite phenomenological theory ( k41 ) , @xmath8 .",
    "this richardson _ forward _ cascade of energy , from large to small length scales , continues until the length scale @xmath7 , at which point viscous dissipation becomes significant  @xcite and @xmath0 falls very rapidly for @xmath9 .    in two - dimensional ( 2d ) ,",
    "statistically steady turbulence , the richardson forward cascade is replaced by two cascades , one forward and the other inverse  @xcite , because of the conservation of energy and enstrophy in the unforced , inviscid limit . in the forward - cascade regime ,",
    "enstrophy cascades from @xmath10 to larger values of @xmath1 and leads to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 depends on the friction on the 2d fluid film ( if there is no friction , @xmath13 ) ; by contrast , in the inverse - cascade regime , energy cascades from @xmath10 to smaller values of @xmath1 , which leads to the formation of large vortices , whose size is limited , finally , by the friction  @xcite . direct numerical simulations ( dnss )",
    "have been used to study the two cascades in 2d fluid turbulence in great detail  @xcite .",
    "inverse energy cascades have been found and investigated in other turbulent systems , such as quasi - geostrophic flows  @xcite and turbulence in fluid films with polymer additives  @xcite .",
    "it has also been noted that quantities other than the energy can show inverse cascades ; examples include the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity in three - dimensional ( 3d ) mhd turbulence  @xcite and its analog in 2d mhd turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the 3d mhd equations conserve the energy @xmath14 , cross helicity , and magnetic helicity in the inviscid , unforced case ; when viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are included , forced 3d mhd turbulence displays a nonequilibrium statistically steady state in which the magnetic helicity displays an inverse cascade , from the forcing length scale to larger scales , whereas the energy and cross helicity display forward cascades  @xcite .",
    "the 2d mhd analog of the magnetic helicity is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the 2d scalar analog of the 3d magnetic vector potential  @xcite .",
    "the inverse cascade in turbulent mhd is very important in the formation of large - scale structures in astrophysical plasmas  @xcite .    to provide some background for our study",
    ", we begin with dimensional predictions  @xcite for the fluid- and magnetic - energy spectra , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , in the 2d mhd inverse - cascade regime , which we have described above .",
    "the dimensions ( indicated by square brackets and expressed as powers of length @xmath19 and time @xmath20 ) of various quantities are given below ( velocity and magnetic fields have the same units in the standard formulation of mhd  @xcite ) : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , dissipation rates per unit time for @xmath15 and @xmath24 , and the arguments @xmath1 denote spatial fourier transforms .",
    "@xmath15 displays an inverse cascade , so we can make a kolmogorov - type ansatz  @xcite for its spectrum , namely , in the inverse - cascade region , @xmath22 should not depend on viscosity , magnetic diffusivity , and friction .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath25 and then dimensional analysis ( eq .  [ eq : dimensions1 ] ) requires @xmath26 from which we find @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30    to obtain the scaling form for @xmath17 , we must make an additional assumption .",
    "one such assumption  @xcite is that the nonlinear terms in the velocity equation in 2d mhd ( see below ) must balance each other in the inverse - cascade regime ; this assumption implies @xmath31 .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that this result is valid only in the forward - cascade parts of these energy spectra , because the large - scale part of the magnetic field leads to an alfvn - type effect , which yields , in turn , a strong coupling between small - scale velocity and magnetic fields and implies , thereby , that @xmath32 ; ref .",
    "@xcite goes on to suggest that this effect may not operate in the inverse - cascade regime in 2d mhd .",
    "our study has been designed to explore , among other issues , the scaling forms of such spectra in this regime .",
    "we build on earlier studies of inverse cascades in homogeneous , isotropic , and statistically steady mhd turbulence , in both 3d  @xcite and 2d  @xcite , by carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations ( dnss ) of the forced 2d mhd equations , with friction , and forcing that yields a substantial spectral regime in which there is a substantial inverse - cascade region in the spectrum for @xmath15 .",
    "we investigate two cases r1 , with a finite , positive friction , and r2 , with zero friction .",
    "our study yields a variety of interesting and unforeseen results .",
    "the most remarkable result of our study is that the runs r1 and r2 yield quantitatively different statistical properties . in particular , run r1 yields fluid- and magnetic - energy spectra whose scaling forms in the inverse - cascade regime are , respectively , consistent with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; by contrast , run r2 yields energy spectra that are consistent with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , we find that , in both runs r1 and r2 , the pdfs of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath16 , and @xmath39 ( the fluid stream function ) are close to gaussian ; we characterize mild deviations from gaussian forms by calculating the kurtoses for these pdfs .",
    "the pdfs of field increments , such as @xmath40 , are also predominantly gaussian , but their hyperflatnesses @xmath41 , which depend on the length scale @xmath42 , show deviations from the gaussian value of 15 , especially for the increments @xmath16 and @xmath39 .",
    "the angle between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is @xmath43 and that between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "we obtain the pdfs of these angles and show therefrom that , in both runs r1 and r2 , ( a ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 are perfectly aligned or anti - aligned , with equal probability , and ( b ) the pdf of @xmath47 is symmetrical about a minima at @xmath48 and attains its highest values at @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain the okubo - weiss parameter @xmath50 , which is positive ( negative ) in regions where the fluid flow is vortical ( extensional ) , and its magnetic analog @xmath51 ; we then obtain pdfs of @xmath50 and @xmath51 and also their joint pdf ; and we show that they are qualitatively similar for runs r1 and r2 ; in particular , the pdfs have a cusp at the origin and tails that we fit to exponential forms .",
    "we also explore the scaling and possible multiscaling of structure functions of field increments .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains a description of equations of 2d mhd , the quantities we calculate , and the numerical methods we use . in section",
    "iii we present our results .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions and a discussion of our results .",
    "the 2d mhd equations can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 , the magnetic field , and @xmath54 , the velocity field , are related to the 2d analog of the magnetic vector potential @xmath16 and the stream function @xmath39 as follows : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the unit vector normal to our 2d simulation domain .",
    "the current density and vorticity fields are , respectively , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this form ,",
    "the 2d mhd equations satisfy the incompressibility condition @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "the order of the dissipativity is @xmath64 , the coefficients of friction in the two equations are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity ; @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the forcing terms .",
    "we carry out two dnss of these equations ; the first dns ( r1 ) has hyperviscosity and hyperdiffusivity with @xmath71 , which allow us to obtain large inertial ranges in energy spectra ; and the second dns ( r2 ) has conventional viscosity and diffusivity with @xmath72 ; the other parameters for these runs are given in table  [ table : param ] . in the dns r2 , @xmath73 , so the inverse cascade in @xmath16 leads to an accumulation of magnetic energy at small @xmath1 in the magnetic - energy spectrum ( fig .",

    "we then evolve the system until we obtain a peak in the energy - dissipation rate ; this signals that the energy in the low-@xmath1 modes has cascaded down to high-@xmath1 modes . at this time , we start forcing the system at a large value of @xmath85 , in order to obtain a clear , inverse - cascade regime .",
    "we use the following forcing terms : @xmath86 we now allow the system to reach a statistically steady state , maintain it in this state for @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the box - size eddy - turnover time , and then collect data for an averaging time @xmath89 ( see table  [ table : param ] ) for the statistical properties we study .",
    "in addition to the spatiotemporal evolution of @xmath37 and @xmath16 , we obtain @xmath90 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the fluid reynolds number is @xmath91 , its magnetic analog is @xmath92 , the root - mean - square velocity is @xmath93 , the effective viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are , respectively , @xmath94 the box - size eddy turnover time is @xmath95 , and the kinetic- and magnetic - energy spectra are @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "we also calculate the fluid okubo - weiss parameter  @xcite @xmath97 for a fluid , in the inviscid , unforced case without friction , the sign of @xmath50 can be used to distinguish between vortical and extensional regions of the flow . in particular ,",
    "the flow is vortical , if @xmath98 , and it is extensional , if @xmath99 .",
    "this criterion works well even in the presence of viscosity , friction , and forcing  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to introduce the magnetic analog @xmath51 of the fluid okubo - weiss parameter @xmath50 ; @xmath51 follows from the determinant of the magnetic - field - gradient tensor and can be written as the difference of the squares of the current density and the magnetic strain rate  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath100 in current - dominated regions , whereas @xmath101 in regions that are dominated by the magnetic strain rate .",
    "specifically , @xmath51 is defined as follows  @xcite : @xmath102    we obtain field - increment pdfs and structure functions from @xmath103 and similar equations for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",

    "we obtain error bars by carrying out local - slope analyses in the power - law ranges of these structure functions .",
    "the deviations of the multiscaling exponent ratios from a simple - scaling straight line ( see the dashed line in fig.13c ) are very small .",
    "thus , only very - high - resolution dns can settle whether such multiscaling exists at all ; such dnss lie beyond the scope of this study .",
    "we have presented the most comprehensive study of the statistical properties of homogeneous , isotropic 2d mhd turbulence in the inverse - cascade regime .",

    "furthermore , we have calculated many more statistical properties compared to earlier studies of 2d mhd turbulence  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that these statistical properties are different for runs r1 and r2 , i.e. , these properties depend on the friction , viscosity , and magnetic - diffusivity coefficients that distinguish these runs .",

    "[ fig : spectra2 ] ) , as we have discussed in detail above .",

    "@xcite fall in this range , in a manner that suggests a friction term , but this is not mentioned explicitly in their paper . note that ref .",
    "@xcite employs hyperviscosity ( fourth power of the laplacian ) , whereas we use conventional viscosity in run r2 .",

    "they also report a power - law form , @xmath227 , in the forward - cascade regime , which we do not study here ( we choose a large value of @xmath10 so that we have a large inverse - cascade range ) .",
    "thus , spectral features seem to depend in detail on the precise dissipation or friction terms that are used in a dns and perhaps also on the details of the forcing ( e.g. , whether both or one of the velocity or magnetic fields are forced ) .",
    "a full elucidation of such dependences must await very - high - resolution and long dnss .",
    "such high - resolution dnss might also be required to remove the mild ripples in the pseudocolor plots of figs .",

    "all these pdfs are close to gaussian ones , but they show slight deviations from gaussians in their tails .",

    "our joint pdfs of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for both runs r1 and r2 , are sharply peaked at the origin and display ridges that separate the four quadrants in the @xmath230 plane . by using pseudocolor plots @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with superimposed contour lines of @xmath39 and @xmath16 ,",

    "the most significant deviations occur for the pdfs of @xmath105 and @xmath163 ; for these increments we obtain their order-@xmath108 structure functions , in the range @xmath232 , and from these the multiscaling exponent ratios @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
