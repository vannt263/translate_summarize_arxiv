    "in the recent decades , @xmath0-ray astrophysics has made great advances enabled by improvements in instrumentation in the high energy technologies .",
    "the most recent and most accurate @xmath0-ray source catalog is the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) second source catalog ( 2fgl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on the first 24 months of data from lat . thanks to its silicon strip pair production and modern analysis processes , lat has drastically reduced the positional error of the sources with respect to previous studies , like those performed by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on board the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "as the _ fermi_-lat @xmath0-ray observations of the sky continue , the task of finding clear counterparts to all the detected sources becomes increasingly challenging , mostly due to the large positional uncertainty of the faintest sources .",
    "since a strong connection between @xmath0-ray and radio emission has been clearly demonstrated @xcite , it is natural to exploit radio surveys for finding new associations .",
    "several association methods have been proposed to match the @xmath0-ray sources detected with source catalogs at lower frequencies @xcite , to give a proper counterpart to unidentified sources , where possible . of the 1873 sources in the 2fgl catalog , 575 have unknown physical nature . regarding the _ fermi _ sources of known types , blazars are the largest known population representing more than 80% .",
    "it is , therefore , fair to presume that a significant fraction of the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources ( ugss ) can be unrecognized blazar - like sources .",
    "finding them is the aim of our work .",
    "blazars are compact radio sources with flat ( i.e. , spectral index @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ) radio spectra that steepen towards the infrared - optical bands ; their overall spectral energy distribution shows two broadband components : the low energy one peaking in the infrared ( ir ) to x - ray frequency range , while the high energy one extends up to the mev - to - tev range .",
    "their emission features high and variable polarization , apparent superluminal motions of radio jet components and high apparent luminosity , coupled with rapid flux variability over the whole electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "blazars come into two classes : flat - spectrum radio quasars and bl lac objects , which we label here as bzqs and bzbs respectively , following roma - bzcat @xcite nomenclature .",
    "blazar emission interpreted as originating in radio loud active galaxies , with one of the relativistic jets emerging from the super - massive black hole in the galaxy nucleus pointing almost directly to the observer @xcite .",
    "this paper is the latest of a series that focus on the nature of ugss : @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , which investigates sources as ugss counterparts as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iii ) adds another feature for the search of blazar - like sources focusing on the low - frequency radio feature of blazars ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iv ) involves the x - ray emission as a distinctive feature and ( * ? ? ? * paper v ) propose a renewed ir approach , based on a 2-dimensional kernel density estimation ( kde ) technique , all for the same purpose .    in this work ,",
    "we apply the method proposed in  to search for blazar - like candidates within the @xmath0-ray positional uncertainty regions of the ugss listed in the 2fgl and to select counterpart among them .",
    "this method is based on a multifrequency procedure , relying primarily on the flatness of the radio spectrum . the innovative point in this method",
    "is that it is based on low - frequency ( i.e. , @xmath3 ghz ) measurements , which is unprecedented in the investigation the emission of blazars and their association with ugss . in",
    ", we combined the observations at 325mhz from the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) at 325mhz with those of the nrao very large array sky survey ( nvss ) at 1.4ghz . in this work ,",
    "we apply the same approach to the region covered by the counterpart of wenss in the southern sky : the westerbork in the southern hemisphere ( wish , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thanks to the combined results of this new search and of , we build a reasonably sized population of new low - frequency selected blazar candidates .",
    "we study the spectral properties of individual candidates and explore the flux density distribution of the whole sample in comparison to the @xmath0-ray blazars already listed in the 2nd _ fermi _ lat catalog of active galactic nuclei ( 2lac , * ? ? ?",
    "we further refine our search by looking for ir , optical , uv and x - ray counterparts within the catalogs available .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .  2",
    "we describe our method ; in sect .",
    "3 we report and characterize our list of candidates ; in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the spectral properties of all the sources found with the low - frequency method and make some projections regarding expectations from new low - frequency radio telescopes and surveys .",
    "the characteristics of blazars ( in particular @xmath0-ray emitting blazars ) in this range of the electromagnetic spectrum are discussed in ; we briefly summarize those results here for the sake of clarity .",
    "based on the cross correlation between the 2fgl catalog , the roma - bzcat v4.1 ( the most comprehensive blazar catalog up to now ) , and the wenss , we defined one sample labeled as low radio frequency blazar ( lb ) and a subsample labeled low radio frequency @xmath0-ray blazar ( lgb ) .",
    "since the roma - bzcat catalog is based on the nvss survey , we computed the low - frequency radio spectral index values for these samples as :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the low radio frequency measured in mhz ( i.e. , 325 mhz for wenss and 352 mhz for wish ) , @xmath6 is the flux density measured at 1400 mhz in the nvss survey and @xmath7 is the flux density measured at @xmath5 frequency .",
    "both flux densities are measured in mjy .",
    "the indices of about 80% of the sources from both the lb and lgb samples are smaller than 0.5 and 99% have indices below 1.0 @xcite .",
    "the flatness of the radio spectrum can be seen as a consequence of the dominance , also at low radio frequencies , of the inner jet departing from the core relative to the emission radiated by the larger structures of the blazar .",
    "in particular for the @xmath0-ray blazar sample , we consider as _ a class _ candidates the radio sources characterized by @xmath8 and _ b class _ as those with @xmath9 .",
    "these two classes have been defined to represent respectively the 80% ( _ a class _ ) and 90% ( _ b class _ ) of @xmath0-ray blazar radio spectral indices .",
    "in fact , the flatness of radio spectrum above 1ghz is indeed a well known feature and was already used to discern @xmath0-ray blazar associations in the past @xcite .",
    "the low - frequency radio observations allow us to confirm this flatness down to 325mhz .",
    "the wish survey is the natural extension of the wenss survey to 1.60 sr of the southern sky . at 352mhz .",
    "both surveys were performed in the 1990s by the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , using the bandwidth synthesis mosaicing technique to combine 8 different bands of 5 mhz .",
    "wish covers the area between @xmath10 to a limiting flux density of @xmath11 mjy ( @xmath12 ) , the same limiting flux density as the wenss . due to the low elevation of the observations ,",
    "the survey has a lower resolution in declination ( @xmath13 ) than in right ascension ( @xmath14 ) , resulting poorer source localization than for wenss by a factor @xmath15 on average . aside from this consideration ,",
    "the wish shares with the wenss the same features upon which this method was calibrated , except for a negligible difference in frequency ( @xmath16 mhz ) . for this reason",
    ", we are confident in applying the same association procedure that we used for wenss .      for each ugs in the wish footprint",
    ", we search for low - frequency sources in a circular region of radius equal to the semi - major axis of the 95% confidence level positional uncertainty ellipse of the ugs itself . for each wish source found , we look for a corresponding nvss source in a circular region of radius equal to 8.5  and we then calculate the radio spectral index @xmath17 . for this study , we only consider wish sources classified as single component sources and featuring a nvss association .",
    "in addition , we made local maps of the search regions for each ugs , overlaying on the wish background the brightness contours of the nvss map , the _ fermi _ positional uncertainty ellipse , and any possible blazar - like _ wise _ detection up to 3.3  from the position of the matching nvss source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : map2 ] ) .",
    "this gave us , in addition to a qualitative comparison of the relative positions of various possible candidates and the ugs , a clue about their potential non - blazar nature if complex structures are visible .",
    "also , the angular separation between a candidate and the center of the _ fermi _  ellipse was taken in account in cases of multiple matches , with the nearest source preferred .    for associations between wish and nvss and between nvss and _ wise",
    "_ , the search radii ( of 8.5 , and 3.3 , respectively ) were selected based on a statistical study , as described in .",
    "finally , we looked for additional multifrequency data for our new blazar candidates and those found in .",
    "in particular , we searched for matches with sources in the australia telescope 20 ghz survey(at20 g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the wish candidates , and in the green bank 4.85 ghz northern sky survey ( gb6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the wenss candidates .",
    "the at20 g survey , performed between 2005 and 2006 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , contains sources with @xmath18 mjy ; the gb6 , performed between 1986 and 1987 with the nrao seven - beam receiver , takes into account sources with @xmath19 mjy .",
    "for these surveys , source association is automatically provided by nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for the analysis of x - ray emission observed by the _ swift _ x - ray telescope .",
    "of the 575 ugss in the 2fgl catalog , we discard all that feature a ` @xmath20 ' analysis flag to rule out potentially confused or spurious detections due to the strong interstellar emission @xcite .",
    "the resulting list of ugss on the wish footprint has 27 @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "of these , 17 have at least one wish and nvss match ( table  [ tab : table ] ) .",
    "the total number of candidates is 31 .",
    "seven of these candidates have a radio spectral index in the range @xmath21 and are considered _ class a _ candidates while six are in the range @xmath22 and are considered _ class b _ candidates .",
    "sixteen out of the 31 candidates in the wish footprint feature a _ wise _  detection in at least two ir bands ; three of them are _ a class _ candidates and two are _",
    "b class_. however , we do not consider _ wise _  detection to be necessary for selection .",
    "ir data ( see table  [ tab : wise ] ) are taken from the _ allwise _ november 2013 release @xcite .",
    "flat spectrum radio quasars at high redshift or high synchrotron peaked bzbs could be too faint in the ir to be detected in one or more _ wise _  bands ; moreover , the relative astrometry of the wish and nvss might be poorer in this region @xcite in respect to wenss and nvss .",
    "all considered , we propose eight ugss blazar - like associations ( i.e. , five _ a _ and two _ b _ class candidates and one special case for wbn 2255.7@xmath231833 ) .",
    "in particular , we increase the number of _ class a _ and _ class b _ associations combined with to 19 and 8 , respectively .      in this work and in",
    ", we evaluate the flatness of the radio spectrum according to eqn .",
    "[ eq : index ] on the basis of just two non - simultaneous flux density measurements , at 1.4ghz ( nvss ) and at low - frequency ( 352mhz for the wish or 325mhz for the wenss ) . for this reason ,",
    "it is important to find other radio flux density data to better investigate the spectral and variability properties of the candidates .",
    "we searched the literature for other radio surveys performed in the wenss and wish footprints ; we consider here all the candidates found both in and in the present work .    in the wenss footprint",
    ", we found that six _ a class _ and two _ b class _ candidates are listed in the gb6 survey at 5ghz .",
    "we report them in table [ tab : regr1 ] along with the radio spectral index , obtained with a weighted linear regression on the measurements at the three frequencies .",
    "for all these sources , the 5 ghz flux density is in good agreement with the extrapolation of the low - frequency spectrum , confirming that the radio spectrum is flat and flux density variability is not dramatic .",
    "a sample spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regr1 ] ( left panel ) .    in the wish footprint",
    ", we find that one _ b class _ ( wnb 1251.8@xmath232148 , alias nvss 125429@xmath23220419 ) is also listed in the at20 g .",
    "data and radio spectral index regression are reported in table [ tab : regr2 ] ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : regr1 ] , right panel ) . in this case , the extrapolation of the low - frequency power law clearly fails to match the high frequency data , suggesting prominent variability or a rather complex spectral shape , with a strongly inverted component above a few ghz ; either way , the source behavior is consistent with the bzb class .",
    "as we already noted , the wish and wenss surveys are very similar but , a posteriori , we can draw some useful conclusions regarding the impacts their different features had on our study .",
    "the poorer resolution in declination of wish ( @xmath24 on average ) mainly affects the spatial association and not the parameters on which the counterpart is selected . since spatial association is calibrated with a higher resolution survey like wenss , applying it to the wish region and catalog results in a more conservative approach . the fact that we found almost the same ratio ( i.e. @xmath25 ) of candidates per ugs in both wenss and wish ( 58 wenss candidates for 32 ugss and 31 wish candidates for 17 ugss ) indicates that , on average , spatial association is not compromised .",
    "similarly , the resolution discrepancy can not be blamed for any impact on the quality of the associations proposed among the candidates , given the similar rate of @xmath0-ray blazar - like associations in the two surveys .",
    "in fact , in we propose 21 ( including one special association that is neither _ class a _ nor _ class b _ ; see ) new @xmath0-ray blazars out of 65 ugss in the wenss region ( i.e. ,  @xmath26 ) and 8 out of 27 in wish region ( i.e. ,  @xmath27 ) can be explained , in addition to simple statistics , on the grounds of the slightly different starting list , since in  we considered only @xmath0-ray sources without _ any _ analysis flag , while here we excluded only the sources with the _ c _ @xmath0-ray analysis flag in the 2fgl @xcite . ] .",
    "other methods have been suggested to recognize low - energy counterparts to ugss , or at least to provide a statistically significant classification of these sources .",
    "for instance , @xcite have developed a statistical approach to classify ugss in the first catalog of _ fermi _  sources ( 1fgl , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "six of the 2fgl ugss in the wish footprint are associated with 1fgl sources analyzed by @xcite , five of which are agn - like and one of which is pulsar - like . within the former sample",
    ", there are two sources for which we propose an association with a blazar counterpart on the basis of the low - frequency spectrum : 2fgl j2017.5@xmath231618 and 2fgl j2358.4@xmath231811 .",
    "interestingly , for the single ugs for which @xcite propose a pulsar classification ( 2fgl j1544.5@xmath231126 ) , our method finds a wenss - nvss match with quite steep spectral index ( @xmath28 ) , rejecting a blazar scenario .",
    "we further compared our results with the proposed associations found in the other papers of this series . in figure  [ f.wgs ]",
    "we show the comparison between the distribution in the ir @xmath29-[4.6]-[12]\\ , \\mu$]m color - color plane provided by _ wise _  for the @xmath0-ray emitting blazars and the sources selected in this work .",
    "the overall distribution of the whole set of the simultaneous wish - nvss matches ( black , red and green dots ) is quite more scattered than the @xmath0-ray blazar population ( orange dots ) .",
    "however , when we only consider the low - frequency selected blazar candidates , all of the most prominent outliers are excluded and the remaining five sources ( black and red dots ) are in much better agreement with the ir colors of @xmath0-ray blazars . in two cases ,",
    "the @xmath30-class candidates nvss 120900@xmath23231335 and nvss 222830@xmath23163643 , the agreement is very good . for the latter source ,",
    "associated with 2fgl j2228.6@xmath231633 , our method also provides the same counterpart candidate selected on the basis of the kernel density estimator technique to ir colors of wise counterparts applied to x - ray @xcite and radio @xcite data .",
    "the @xmath0-ray blazar candidates selected in this work and in  have by selection the same radio spectral properties of confirmed roma - bzcat blazars and of 2fgl blazar associations .",
    "it is natural to wonder why these sources have not been detected in the 2fgl catalog and eventually associated , e.g.  in the second catalog of agns detected by _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the sources could have been excluded from the 2lac because they do not formally pass the threshold for being considered high confidence associations ( a test that does not take into account the spectral index ) ; typically , this could happen for low flux density radio sources , which have a larger spatial density .",
    "it is thus likely that , together with a general similarity to the already known blazars , our candidates also have some peculiar characteristics .    for this reason ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] the distribution of radio flux density at 1.4ghz for all the blazars in the 2lac and for the candidates selected here and in",
    ". the two distributions are clearly different , as confirmed by a kolmogorov",
    " smirnov test which yields a probability of @xmath31 of being obtained from the same population .",
    "in particular , the 2lac blazar flux density distribution is shifted to much larger values .",
    "this strongly suggests that our method is very efficient at selecting faint blazars .",
    "these sources are potentially of great interest : if they are of the bzb type , it could mean that they could be of the extreme and elusive class of ultra - high synchrotron peaked sources ; one prominent example could be wnb 2225.8@xmath231652 , which has an inverted low - frequency radio spectral index of @xmath32 and is our proposed association for the ugs 2fgl j2228.6@xmath231633 , characterized by a @xmath0-ray spectrum as hard as @xmath33 . on the other hand",
    ", some of our candidates could also be faint bzqs , and in this case their low flux densities could stem from their high redshifts ( like wn 1500.0 + 4815 with an estimated redshift of 2.78 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would also make them of scientific value .",
    "no wish sources have a measured redshift .      we have searched for counterparts of the the 27 ugss in the 1.6 sr footprint of the wish survey , following the methods described in  and based on the flat spectrum at low - frequency characteristic of blazars .",
    "we have found blazar - like associations for 8 ugss , that together with the 23 sources selected in the wenss footprint with the same method provides a blazar association for a sample of 30 new @xmath0-ray blazar associations .",
    "this sample extends the distribution of the radio flux density of @xmath0-ray blazars to lower values , allowing us to study otherwise elusive agns .",
    "the application of our method thus shows promising results in terms of numbers of counterparts proposed and their physical features .",
    "in particular , the possibility of using low - frequency radio data to find ugss counterparts is even more important in the light of the imminent start of numerous studies in this frequency range , like the low frequency array ( lofar , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the murchison widefield array ( mwa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the long wavelength array ( lwa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and eventually the square kilometer array ( ska , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these facilities will allow our method to be extended using an even deeper and simultaneous dataset , while dedicated targeting of the candidates with optical spectroscopy and very long baseline interferometry observations will confirm the natures of the proposed associations .",
