    "<S> , events of type @xmath95 can result from one measurement error or from ancilla bit flips in two consecutive rounds . because photon - induced errors primarily lead to single ancilla bit flips </S>",
    "<S> , we also extract the probability of encountering an event of type @xmath94 per cycle , @xmath105 , and investigate its @xmath13 dependence .    decreasing @xmath13 trades off @xmath52-induced errors for photon - induced errors . for passive depletion , </S>",

    "<S> the simple model includes only qubit relaxation and non - photon - induced dephasing ( calibrated using standard @xmath52 and @xmath112 measurements ) . </S>",

    "<S> as we do not model photon - induced pulse errors , we restrict the extensive model to @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement observed between the extensive model and experiment demonstrates the non - demolition character of the measurement and confirms the @xmath68 calibration .    </S>",
    "<S> the multi - round qec emulation can be made more sensitive to leftover photons by harnessing the asymmetry of the qubit decay channel . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , changing the polarity of the final @xmath60 pulse so that the coherent step does not flip the ancilla can keep the ancilla ideally in @xmath2 during measurement and depletion . </S>",

    "<S> clearly , unconditional depletion outperforms conditional and passive depletion , but the reduction of @xmath21 to 50 at short @xmath13 evidences the performance limit reached by our choice of pulses . in a qec context , the key benefit of active depletion in this non - flipping variant will be an increase in @xmath21 due to lower per - cycle probability of data qubit errors , afforded by reducing @xmath110 by @xmath101 . evidently , this effect is not captured by our emulation , which is only sensitive to ancilla hardware errors .    . </S>",

    "<S> these @xmath116 experiments motivate two points for discussion and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> first , they highlight the importance of using digital feedback  @xcite in qec to keep ancillas in the ground state as much as possible ( as used in a cat code  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> conveniently , this feedback has relaxed latency requirements ( @xmath117 in our example ) , because the conditional action can be chosen to be the polarity of the final @xmath60 pulse . </S>",
    "<S> second , @xmath21 emerges as an attractive method for quantifying the performance of every element in the qec cycle , not just the depletion step . the advantage over traditional tune - up methods is the speed gained by not reinitializing in @xmath2 following every measurement  @xcite and the ability to tune without interrupting ongoing error correction  @xcite .    in summary , we have investigated two active methods for fast photon depletion in the nonlinear regime of cqed , relying on numerical optimization to successfully outperform passive depletion by more than @xmath101 . active photon depletion will find application in quantum computing scenarios interleaving qubit measurements with coherent qubit operations . here , we have focused on the example of quantum error correction , emulating an ancilla qubit performing repetitive parity checks in a repetition code . </S>",
    "<S> future experiments will focus on combining active depletion with purcell filtering to further reduce qec cycle time from the achieved @xmath0 to @xmath118 , sufficient to cross the error pseudo - threshold in small surface codes at state - of - the - art transmon relaxation times  @xcite .    </S>",
