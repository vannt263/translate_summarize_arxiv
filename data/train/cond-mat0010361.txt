    "liquid @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures at low temperature have been of long - standing interest from both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite viewpoints . from the theoretical side ,",
    "isotopic @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures manifest fascinating properties intrinsically related to their quantum nature .",
    "the different quantum statistics of @xmath1he ( boson ) and @xmath0he ( fermion ) appear reflected in the macroscopic properties of the mixture as its very own existence in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "one of the most relevant features that the @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixture shows is the interplay between both statistics driven by the correlations .",
    "signatures of that are , on the one hand , the influence of @xmath0he on the condensate fraction ( @xmath4 ) and the superfluid fraction ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath1he , and on the other , the change in the momentum distribution of @xmath0he atoms due to the correlations with @xmath1he . both theory and experiment",
    "show that the @xmath1he superfluid fraction decreases with the @xmath0he concentration ( @xmath6 ) in the mixture@xcite whereas the condensate fraction @xmath4 moves on the opposite direction showing an enhancement with @xmath6.@xcite concerning the @xmath0he momentum distribution in the mixture , microscopic calculations@xcite point to a sizeable decrease in the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to pure @xmath0he , with a subsequent population at high @xmath9 .",
    "the long tail of @xmath10 gives rise to a @xmath0he kinetic energy which is appreciably larger than in pure @xmath0he .",
    "experimental information on the momentum distribution @xmath10 can be drawn from deep inelastic neutron scattering ( dins),@xcite as first proposed by hohenberg and platzman.@xcite it is nowadays well established that at high momentum transfer @xmath11 the scattering is completely incoherent and accurately described by the impulse approximation ( ia ) .",
    "assuming ia , the momentum distribution can be directly extracted from experimental data . however , this procedure is not straightforward because of the unavoidable instrumental resolution effects ( ire ) and the non - negligible final - state effects ( fse ) .",
    "the fse are corrections to ia that take into account correlations between the struck atom and the medium which are completely neglected in the ia . at the typical values of the momentum transfer used in dins on helium ( @xmath12 @xmath3 ) , both ire and fse broaden significantly the ia prediction hindering a neat determination of @xmath10 .",
    "the dominant contributions to the fse are well accounted by the different theoretical methods@xcite used in their study with an overall agreement for @xmath13 @xmath3.@xcite using the theoretical prediction for the fse and the ire associated to the precision of the measurements , dins in superfluid @xmath1he points to a condensate fraction @xmath14 and a single - particle kinetic energy @xmath15 k.@xcite both values are in a nice agreement with the theoretical values obtained with green s function monte carlo ( gfmc),@xcite diffusion monte carlo ( dmc)@xcite and path integral monte carlo ( pimc)@xcite methods .",
    "normal liquid @xmath0he has also been studied by dins.@xcite this system is more involved from a technical point of view due to the large neutron absorption cross section of @xmath0he atoms which significantly reduces the signal - to - noise ratio of the data .",
    "recent measurements of @xmath16 at high @xmath11 point to a single - particle kinetic energy of @xmath17 k,@xcite a value that is clearly larger than a previous dins determination ( @xmath18 k).@xcite a recent theoretical determination of @xmath19 using dmc predicts@xcite a value @xmath20 k in close agreement with other microscopic calculations.@xcite therefore , theory and experiment have become closer but the agreement is still not so satisfactory as in liquid @xmath1he .",
    "these discrepancies have been generally attributed to high - energy tails in @xmath16 , that are masked by the background noise , or even to inadequacies of the gaussian models used to extract the momentum distribution.@xcite    in recent years , there have been a few experimental studies of liquid @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures using dins.@xcite the response of the mixture has been measured at two momenta , @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath21 @xmath3 , and different @xmath0he concentrations . by using the methodology employed in the analysis of the response of pure phases , results for the @xmath1he condensate fraction and the kinetic energies of the two species are extracted as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "this analysis points to a surprising result of @xmath22,@xcite a factor two larger than in pure @xmath1he .",
    "concerning the kinetic energies , a remarkable difference between @xmath1he and @xmath0he appears .",
    "the @xmath1he kinetic energy decreases linearly with @xmath6 whereas @xmath0he atoms show a @xmath6-independent kinetic energy that is the same of the pure @xmath0he phase.@xcite except for the @xmath1he kinetic energy , those experimental measurements yield values that are sizeably different from the available theoretical calculations .",
    "microscopic approaches to the mixture using both variational hypernetted - chain theory@xcite ( hnc ) and diffusion monte carlo@xcite point to a much smaller enhancement of @xmath4 in the mixture , and a @xmath0he kinetic energy much larger at small @xmath6 and that decrease with @xmath6 down to the pure @xmath0he result .",
    "the theoretical estimation of the fse in the scattering is of fundamental interest , and also unavoidable in the analysis of the experimental data . in a previous work,@xcite we recovered the gersch - rodriguez ( gr ) formalism@xcite for liquid @xmath1he , and proved",
    "that using accurate approximations for the two - body density matrix the fse correcting function is very close to the predictions of other fse theories.@xcite the generalization of this theory to a fermi system as liquid @xmath0he is not straightforward .",
    "the convolutive scheme developed for a boson fluid is now impeded by the zeros present in the fermi one - body density matrix .",
    "recently , it has been proposed an approximate gr - fse theory that incorporates the leading exchange contributions without the aforementioned problems.@xcite that theory is expected to capture the essential contributions of fermi statistics , and thereby to be accurate enough to generate the fse correcting function in dilute @xmath0he-@xmath1he liquid mixtures .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide microscopic results on the fse effects in @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures .",

    "therefore , at a fixed momentum transfer @xmath11 fse in @xmath1he are expected to be smaller than in @xmath1he . in the scale used in fig .",
    "5 , the @xmath185 functions at @xmath151 would be hardly distinguishable from the ones at @xmath152 .",
    "the compton profile @xmath192 , derived from the fourier transform of @xmath79 , is shown in fig . 6 at the two @xmath6 values considered .",
    "@xmath192 presents a central peak and two minima close to @xmath164 .",
    "the absolute value of this function is small compared to both @xmath134 and the ia response @xmath163 ( [ jia ] ) but manifests a sizeable dependence on the @xmath0he concentration .",
    "this feature is patent in fig .",
    "6 , where one can see how the contribution of @xmath192 increases with @xmath6 .",
    "this is an expected result taking into account that in the current approximation @xmath193 incorporates all the fermi effects to the @xmath0he fse function .    according to the theory developed in sect .",
    "ii , the @xmath1he response in the mixture , @xmath194 is the sum of two terms : the non - condensate part of the ia convoluted with @xmath191 , and @xmath195 , which is the contribution of the condensate once broadened by fse .",
    "the different terms contributing to the final response are separately shown in fig .",
    "the correction driven by @xmath4 is by far the largest one . in spite of the small value of @xmath4 , the broadening of the condensate term , which transforms the delta singularity predicted by the ia into a function of finite height and width , unambiguously produces non - negligible fse in the @xmath1he peak .",
    "the obvious lack of a condensate fraction in the @xmath0he component reduces the quantitative relevance of its fse .",
    "the @xmath0he fse correcting functions and the corresponding ia response , are compared in fig . 8 at @xmath152 .",
    "the convolution of the ia with @xmath134 produces a slight quenching of @xmath196 around the peak and a complete smoothing of the discontinuity in the derivative of @xmath163 at @xmath164 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath192 is rather small but restores to some extent the change in the derivative around @xmath197 .      scattering experiments",
    "suffer from instrumental resolution effects ( ire ) that tend to smooth the detailed structure of the dynamic structure function .",
    "any comparison between theory and experiment have therefore to include in the analysis the ire contributions . from the theoretical side",
    ", it would be desirable to remove the ire from the data to allow for a direct comparison .",
    "this process would imply a deconvolution procedure that is known to be highly unstable . as suggested by sokol _",
    "et al._,@xcite it is better to convolute the theoretical prediction with the ire function @xmath198 , and then to compare the result with the experimental data .",
    "the functions @xmath198 provided by sokol@xcite are reported in fig .",
    "9 . as one can see , at @xmath2 @xmath3 the ire corrections are of the same order of the fse functions @xmath185 , and in fact their magnitude significantly increases with @xmath11 .",
    "the ire functions for the mixture ( fig .",
    "9 ) present a small shift of their maximum to negative @xmath90 values , a feature that makes the peak of the total response be slightly moved in the same direction .    in fig .",
    "10 , the generalized compton profile @xmath199 ( including both the ire and fse ) is compared with the scattering data of wang and sokol.@xcite those measurements were carried out in a @xmath152 mixture at @xmath200 k and a momentum transfer @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data led the authors to estimate the @xmath1he condensate fraction and the single - particle kinetic energies of both species . in ref .",
    ", a value @xmath201 , and kinetic energies @xmath202 k and @xmath203 k are reported . that work , and an independent measurement performed by azuah _",
    "et al._,@xcite agree in the values of the kinetic energies and in their dependence with the @xmath0he concentration .",
    "both analysis coincide in a decrease in @xmath204 with @xmath6 and a more surprising constancy of @xmath205 along @xmath6 .",
    "microscopic calculations@xcite of those quantities only agree with the experimental result of @xmath206 .",
    "several independent calculations,@xcite including the present one , suggest smaller values of @xmath4 ( @xmath207 ) and larger values of @xmath205 ( @xmath208 k ) , in clear disagreement with the experimental estimations .",
    "let us turn to fig .",
    "10 with the comparison between the theoretical and experimental responses .",
    "the theoretical result , constructed using eqs .",
    "( [ jtot4],[jtot3 ] ) , but replacing the ia @xmath97 with the final responses @xmath121 , shows sizeable differences with respect to the experimental data and a lack of strength below the two peaks . in order to clarify the origin of such a large discrepancy , we have compared the @xmath209 and @xmath210 sum rules obtained by direct integration of the experimental @xmath199 with the theoretical results ( sect .",
    "that check has shown that the @xmath209 and @xmath210 values obtained from the two procedures are not compatible .",
    "our conclusion is that the reported experimental compton profiles are probably written in in a different way than in eq .",
    "( [ jiatot ] ) .",
    "in fact , after the analysis of different possibilities , we have verified that if one defines the response in the form @xmath211 or @xmath212 the agreement in both sum rules is recovered . by moving our results to those modified compton profiles @xmath213 , the agreement between theory and experiment improves significantly but only to what concerns the @xmath0he peak .",
    "notice that the @xmath1he peak is not modified when going from @xmath199 to @xmath214 , and that a significant difference in the height of the peak still remains .",
    "the missing strength of the theoretical @xmath1he peak with respect to the experimental data could justify the difference between the theoretical and experimental values of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the present variational momentum distribution predicts @xmath4 values that are indistinguishable from a dmc estimation.@xcite therefore , this difference should not be attributed to inaccuracies of our @xmath98 but rather to an intriguing gap between theory and experiment . at this point",
    ", it is worth considering the difficulties the experimentalists have to face to extract @xmath4 and @xmath110 from the measured data .",
    "on the one hand , experience in the pure @xmath1he response has shown that different momentum distributions ( with different @xmath4 s ) can be accurately fitted to the data . on the other ,",
    "the kinetic energy per particle is derived from the @xmath215 sum rule whose estimation is highly influenced by the tails of the response .",
    "those tails can not be accurately resolved due to the noise of the data , and thus the prediction of @xmath110 appears relatively uncertain .",
    "that is even more pronounced in the @xmath0he peak because the strong interaction with @xmath1he causes @xmath165 to present non - negligible occupations up to large @xmath9 values .",
    "the influence of @xmath4 and @xmath110 on the momentum distribution , and hence on the response , can be roughly estimated from the behavior of the one - body density matrix .",
    "in a simple approximation , one can perform a cumulant expansion of @xmath216 and relate the lowest order cumulants to the lowest order sum rules of @xmath98 . introducing an expansion parameter @xmath217 , @xmath218 taking into account that @xmath219 and considering @xmath220 , @xmath221 \\ . \\label{rtil4}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ rtil4 ] )",
    "can then be used to relate @xmath222 to a new one - body density matrix @xmath223 with slightly different values @xmath224 and @xmath225 @xmath226   \\ . \\label{rtil5}\\ ] ] in this way , the perturbed @xmath223 and @xmath227 preserve their normalization and allows one to go beyond a simple @xmath4 re - scaling . using this method ,",
    "we have studied the effect of changing @xmath4 and @xmath204 on the @xmath1he response .",
    "11 , the results corresponding to _ i _ ) @xmath228 , @xmath229 k , and _ ii _ ) @xmath230 , @xmath231 k are shown .",
    "as one can see , both slight changes in the theoretical response lead to a nice agreement with the experimental data .",
    "consequently , such a large value of @xmath4 ( @xmath232 ) does not seem to be required in order to reproduce the additional strength observed below the @xmath1he peak .",
    "the re - scaling ( [ rtil5 ] ) shows that a small decrease in the kinetic energy enhances the central peak in the same form an increase of the condensate fraction does .",
    "a generalized gersch - rodriguez formalism has been applied to study the dynamic structure function of the @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixture at high momentum transfer .",
    "the fermi character of @xmath0he forbids a straightforward generalization of most fse theories used in bosonic systems , a problem that has been overcome in an approximate way .",
    "the approximations assumed are however expected to include the leading fermi contributions to the fse , at least in the mixture where the @xmath0he partial density is very small .",
    "the theoretical response obtained shows significant differences with scattering data in both the @xmath1he and the @xmath0he peaks .",
    "however , a sum - rules analysis of the experimental response has shown some inconsistencies . redefining the total response , it is possible to reach agreement between the theoretical and the numerical values of the first - order sum rules .",
    "if the theoretical response is changed in the same way , the agreement is much better .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath1he peak is not modified by this redefinition ( written as a function of @xmath171 ) and an intriguing sizeable difference in its strength subsists . from the theoretical side , several arguments may be argued trying to explain the observed discrepancies .",
    "the first uncertainty could be attributed to the use of a gersch - rodriguez theory to account for the fse . in our opinion ,",
    "that criticism has probably no sense because we have verified that , at similar momentum transfer , the experimental response of pure @xmath1he is fully recovered with the gr theory.@xcite assuming therefore that the theoretical framework is able to describe the high-@xmath11 response of the mixture , one could be led to argue that the approximate microscopic inputs of the theory are not accurate enough .",
    "that argument was put forward in ref .",
    "to explain the differences in @xmath4 and @xmath205 .",
    "one of the main criticisms was the use of the aca , which they claimed could be too restrictive to allow for a reduction of @xmath205 towards a value closer to the experimental one .",
    "however , a dmc calculation@xcite in which the aca is not present , has proved that only a diminution of @xmath233 k in @xmath205 is obtained . concerning the condensate fraction value ,",
    "our variational theory predicts a slight increase of @xmath4 with @xmath6 .",
    "this increase , which is mainly due to the decrease of the equilibrium density when @xmath6 grows , is nevertheless much smaller then the one that would be required to reproduce the experimental prediction .",
    "our results for @xmath4 are again in an overall agreement with the nearly exact dmc calculation of ref . .    in summary",
    ", we would like to emphasize that there exists theoretical agreement on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath205 for mixtures , but these values are quite far from the experimental estimations .",
