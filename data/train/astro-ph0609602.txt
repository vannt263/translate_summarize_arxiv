    "be stars are rapidly rotating b - type stars that lose mass into an equatorial , circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the disk flux is observed in emission lines ( especially the hydrogen h@xmath0 line ) , an infrared excess , and the polarization of starlight scattered in the disk .",
    "it is now possible to investigate the actual extent and geometry of the circumstellar disks through optical long baseline interferometry of nearby be stars @xcite .",
    "most of these investigations have focused on the angular resolution of the disks in a narrow spectral band centered on the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "the long baseline interferometric observations are limited to the nearby sample of be stars at present , so we need other indirect methods to help estimate the sizes of be star disks in more distant targets .    here",
    "we explore how the disk radius may be estimated from measurements of the disk h@xmath0 emission flux .",
    "we begin with an idealized case to illustrate some of the important parameters that define the relationship between equivalent width and radius .",
    "suppose that the disk is isothermal and geometrically thin and that the line emission is dominated by an inner optically thick region that appears as an ellipse projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "we also make the simplifying assumption that the specific intensity of the disk emission @xmath2 is isotropic .",
    "then the wavelength integrated h@xmath0 flux will depend on the product of the surface flux , the wavelength range where h@xmath0 is optically thick , and the projected solid angle , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the wavelength interval over which the line is optically thick ( averaged over the visible disk ) , @xmath5 is the disk normal inclination angle , @xmath6 is the boundary radius of the optically thick disk , and @xmath7 is the distance to the star .",
    "we measure this flux through the emission equivalent width @xmath8 , which is given in wavelength units relative to the local continuum flux , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ratio of disk continuum flux to stellar flux in the h@xmath0 region , @xmath11 is the stellar specific intensity near h@xmath0 ( assumed isotropic ) , and @xmath12 is the radius of the star .",
    "we can then equate these two expressions to find the predicted relationship between the ratio of disk to stellar radius and h@xmath0 emission equivalent width , @xmath13    this special case is characterized by a disk radius that varies as the square root of the emission equivalent width , and this expectation is supported by the interferometric observations of @xcite who find that the emitted h@xmath0 flux scales with the square of the disk radius .",
    "however , the coefficient of the relationship also depends on the ratio of the stellar to disk specific intensities that is dependent upon the stellar and disk temperatures .",
    "furthermore , there is an inclination dependence in both the @xmath14 projection factor and the @xmath4 term ( through the range in velocities and doppler shifts viewed through the disk ) .",
    "the @xmath4 term also depends upon the assumed disk density since the optical depth is based on the product of neutral hydrogen density and the emission line profile .",
    "finally , there must also be some emission contribution from the optically thin outer disk that is ignored in expression above .",
    "thus , in order to predict accurately the relationship between equivalent width and disk radius , we need a more complete model that accounts for the specific dependences on disk temperature , inclination , and density .    we have adopted the be disk model approach of @xcite that is based upon models developed by @xcite and @xcite for accretion disks in cataclysmic variables .",
    "the disk is assumed to be axisymmetric and centered over the equator of the underlying star , and the gas density varies as @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radial and vertical cylindrical coordinates ( in units of stellar radii ) , @xmath18 is the base density at the stellar equator , @xmath19 is a radial density exponent , and @xmath20 is the disk vertical scale height",
    ". the neutral hydrogen population within the disk is found by equating the photoionization and recombination rates @xcite .",
    "the disk gas is assumed to be isothermal and related to the stellar effective temperature @xmath21 by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the numerical model represents the disk by a large grid of azimuthal and radial surface elements , and the equation of transfer is solved along a ray through the center of each element according to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the derived specific intensity , @xmath25 is the source function for the disk gas ( taken as the planck function for the disk temperature @xmath26 ) , @xmath11 is the specific intensity for a uniform disk star ( taken as the product of the planck function for @xmath21 and an h@xmath0 photospheric absorption line derived from the grid of @xcite ) , and @xmath27 is the integrated optical depth along the ray ( for assumed keplerian rotation ; see eq .",
    "[ 4 ] in @xcite and eq .  [ 7 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the first term applies to all the disk area elements that are unocculted by the star ( see eq .",
    "[ 12 ] in @xcite ) while the second term applies to all elements that correspond to the projected photospheric disk of the star .",
    "the absorption line adopted in @xmath11 is doppler shifted according to solid body rotation for the photospheric position in a star that is rotating at @xmath28 of the critical value .",
    "the model code calculates a synthetic line profile over the range from @xmath29 to @xmath30 km  s@xmath31 at 10 km  s@xmath31 intervals by summing the product of projected area and specific intensity over the disk grid .",
    "we then integrate the line profile relative to the continuum to form a predicted equivalent width ( taken as positive for net absorption or negative for net emission ) .",
    "the model also forms a synthetic image of the star plus disk in the plane of the sky by summing the intensity over a 2.8  nm band centered on h@xmath0 .",
    "we collapsed this image along the projected major axis to get the summed spatial intensity , and then we determined the radius where the summed intensity drops to half its maximum value ( excluding the spatial range corresponding to photospheric intensity ) .",
    "we adopt this half - maximum summed intensity radius as the effective disk radius in the following discussion .",
    "we need to specify the stellar mass and radius in the code in order to determine the disk keplerian velocities , and we adopted these as a function of stellar effective temperature ( or spectral subtype ) using the eclipsing binary results for b - stars from @xcite .",
    "we determined the relationship between model equivalent width and disk radius by running a sequence of models defined by the spectral subtype of the star , the disk inclination , the disk radial density exponent @xmath19 , and the selected value for the outer boundary of the disk .",
    "the final variable for any sequence is the base density @xmath18 , and we computed models over a range in @xmath18 that corresponds to h@xmath0 profiles with no visible emission up to strong emission cases with @xmath32   .",
    "we show the predicted relationship between the disk radius and h@xmath0 equivalent width in figure  1 for the case of a b2  ve star ( @xmath33  k ) assuming @xmath34 and an outer boundary at @xmath35 .",
    "the lower solid line shows the pole - on case ( @xmath36 ) . at higher inclination angles ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the middle and top lines , respectively )",
    "the projected disk area is smaller ( @xmath39 ) , and consequently the emission equivalent width is smaller for a given disk radius .",
    "we do not show the @xmath40 case because the shear broadening approximation for the emission profile width breaks down for an edge - on orientation @xcite .",
    "the symbols along each sequence indicate positions of fiducial base density values .",
    "note that all three curves show the expected square root dependence predicted for the simple case ( eq .  [ 3 ] above ) .",
    "the three dashed lines in figure  1 show the corresponding inclination cases for a b8  ve star ( @xmath41  k ) again made assuming @xmath34 and an outer boundary at @xmath35 .",
    "these curves are all shifted to the left relative to the b2  ve sequences because the photospheric absorption component is larger in cooler b - stars .",
    "the model profiles of the b8  ve sequence have less h@xmath0 emission at a given disk radius than their b2  ve counterparts because at this lower temperature the disk - to - star intensity ratio , the vertical scale height , and the thermal emission line broadening are all smaller .",
    "the dotted line in figure  1 shows how the h@xmath0 equivalent width is reduced when the outer boundary for the disk grid is moved inwards from @xmath35 to @xmath42 for the case of a b2  ve star with a disk inclination of @xmath43 and a disk density exponent of @xmath34 .",
    "the outer disk region contains low brightness , optically thin gas , and although the emission contribution from any particular outer radius area element is small , the projected area of such elements increases with radius so that the selection of the outer boundary condition is important",
    ". we found that increasing the outer boundary from @xmath35 to @xmath44 for this parameter set increased the equivalent widths by only @xmath45 , so we adopted the @xmath35 boundary as our nominal choice .",
    "the selection of the boundary radius will mainly be important for be stars in binary systems where the outer disk will be truncated by the gravitational influence of the companion .",
    "finally , the dot - dashed line in figure  1 shows another sequence for the same b2  ve , @xmath38 , and @xmath35 boundary case , but calculated this time with a larger disk density exponent of @xmath46 ( i.e. , a steeper drop off in density ) .",
    "the overall shape of this curve is almost the same as the one for @xmath34 ( although the fiducial base density points have very different locations ) , and this suggests that the particular choice of density law is not important for the derived equivalent width  radius relationships .",
    "investigations of the infrared flux excess in be stars suggest that the exponent falls in the range @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we caution that the results become more sensitive to the outer disk boundary for @xmath48 where the emission from the optically thin , outer regions assumes more significance .",
    "we have constructed such model sequences for subtypes b0 , b2 , b4 , b6 , and b8  ve , for inclinations @xmath36 , @xmath49 , and @xmath43 , and for outer boundary radii of @xmath50 , @xmath42 , @xmath51 , and @xmath35 .",
    "these numerical results , an interpolation program , and our code are available to interested readers at our web sitegies / idlpro / bedisk.tar ] .",
    "we can test the predictions of the model with the interferometric observations of nearby be stars for which the projected disk shape and size in the sky are known .",
    "the long baseline interferometric observations in the narrow band surrounding h@xmath0 are fit with an elliptical gaussian , and the reported diameter @xmath52 is the fwhm of the gaussian fit to the major axis .",
    "we list in table  1 the observed and adopted parameters for the be stars with h@xmath0 interferometric observations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the columns of table  1 list the star name , a contemporaneous measurement of @xmath8 and a code for the data source , adopted effective temperature @xcite , the stellar angular diameter determined from flux fitting methods @xcite , the interferometric disk radius , ratio of the projected minor to major axis @xmath53 , and a code for the data source , an estimate of the disk inclination , and finally the ratio @xmath54 from interferometry and from @xmath8 ( plus the adopted outer boundary for the calculation of the latter ) .",
    "we determined the ratio @xmath54 for each of the observations listed in table  1 by interpolating in the model sequences for @xmath8 , @xmath21 , @xmath5 , and outer disk boundary .",
    "we estimated the disk inclination angle by equating the predicted value of the projected minor to major axis with the observed value , @xmath55 where the disk vertical dimension is evaluated at radial distance @xmath6 , @xmath56 is the speed of sound , and @xmath57 is the keplerian velocity at @xmath58 ( see eq .  [ 4 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath59 is @xmath60 among main sequence b - stars for the temperatures , masses , and radii given by @xcite .",
    "we assumed an outer disk boundary of @xmath35 for all but the known binary stars where we adopted the roche radius of the primary star instead @xcite .",
    "the model disk radii predicted from @xmath8 are listed in table  1 and compared to the interferometric radii in figure  2 .",
    "the predicted radii are generally in reasonable agreement with the observed radii , however , the model tends to overestimate the radii for a given equivalent width ( or to underestimate the equivalent width for a given radius ) for the weaker emission and cooler stars , @xmath61  tau and @xmath62  cmi . furthermore , the predicted radii of the stronger emission stars appear to be systematically lower than observed . we suspect that this latter problem is due to an underestimation of the true emission equivalent width in very active be stars . if be star disks contribute a fraction of the continuum flux in the @xmath1-band spectrum of @xmath63 , then we need to renormalize the equivalent widths to @xmath64 in order to compare them with the model results where the equivalent width is referred to the stellar continuum alone .",
    "we lack direct information on the value of @xmath10 for the targets in table  1 , but we can approximately estimate the renormalization factor from the work of @xcite who found that @xmath65 based upon fits of the spectral energy distributions in a sample of be stars ( see their eq .  [ 40 ] ) .",
    "the revised radii including this correction ( _ open squares _ in fig .  2 )",
    "are in better agreement with the interferometric radii .",
    "thus , the predictions of the models appear to be generally consistent with the available interferometric data .",
    "the method outlined above offers a new way to estimate disk radius for distant be stars that is based only upon the h@xmath0 equivalent width and estimates of spectral subtype , inclination , and outer disk boundary .",
    "it should prove to be a useful addition to the traditional method from @xcite that is based upon measurements of the separation between double peaks of the h@xmath0 profile and upon an assumed mass .",
    "we caution readers that the derived radii for individual targets are probably only accurate to within @xmath66 at the moment ( percentage standard deviation of the residuals for the dilution corrected radii in fig .  2 ) and that higher precision will require detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution and emission lines .",
    "such models will probably need a more detailed physical description of the disk @xcite with attention paid to possible asymmetries in the disk gas @xcite .",
    "the effort involved is certainly merited in studies of selected be stars , but the simpler approach presented here may be valuable in surveys of be stars where observations are limited to low resolution spectroscopic measurements of the h@xmath0 equivalent width ( or a photometric counterpart ; @xcite ) .",
    "the method will also be useful for planning future interferometric observations .",
