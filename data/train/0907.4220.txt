    "the ordering of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) xy spin glass model @xcite has attracted considerable attentions . theoretically , earlier work suggest transitions at zero or very low temperatures . following the pioneering work by villain@xcite where the role of chirality ( i.e. vorticity ) arising for non - collinear xy system , was emphasized , kawamura",
    "et al proposed a chiral - glass transition , even though the finite temperature spin - glass transition vanishes@xcite .",
    "later on , by calculating the binder ratio and the spin - overlap distribution function for lattice sizes up to @xmath2 , kawamura and li have given a numerical evidence that the low temperature phase is a chiral glass without the conventional spin glass order@xcite .",
    "however , this spin - chirality decoupling scenario is not consistent with several studies@xcite . maucourt and grempel@xcite and subsequently , akino and",
    "kosterlitz@xcite found evidence for finite temperature spin - glass transition from zero - temperature domain wall calculations . by performing a finite - size scaling analysis of the correlation length @xmath3 ,",
    "the most successful technique developed in the ising spin glass@xcite , lee and young @xcite observed a transition at the same temperature for both spins and chiralities for lattice sizes up to @xmath4 . beside the equilibrium simulation ,",
    "the resistive behavior in the xy spin glass has been also studied . in a vortex representation ,",
    "wengle and young showed evidence of a resistive transition at finite temperatures@xcite for lattice sizes up to @xmath5 .",
    "granato observed that the current - voltage characteristic in the xy spin glass with both bimodal and gaussian couplings for the lattice size @xmath4 exhibited scaling behaviour@xcite , which was interpreted in terms of both the phase - coherence ( spin - glass ) transition and the chiral - glass transition .",
    "the controversy on the spin - chirality decoupling scenario is however still ongoing@xcite .",
    "for the heisenberg spin glass , the transitions at the same temperature was also observed for both spins and chiralities in ref .",
    "@xcite with the use of the same method for xy spin glass . however , subsequently , it is found that the situation becomes rather unclear when results of larger sizes are included@xcite .",
    "the data at the low temperatures in larger samples show rather marginal behavior , i.e. the system is close to the lower critical dimension .",
    "recently , there seems a intensely competition for the lattice sizes accessible @xcite , the record until now is @xmath6@xcite .",
    "motivated from the debate for heisengurg case , young and his collaborator further study the xy spin glass with larger lattice sizes up to @xmath7@xcite , and observed similar marginal behavior for low temperatures and large systems .",
    "so it is also desirable to perform the simulations on very large sample for xy spin glass .",
    "in contrast with the ising and heisenberg spin glass , there is an additional technique in xy spin glass , that is the measurement of the resistivity from dynamical simulations@xcite .",
    "moreover , one can access larger system in this kind of dynamical simulations , because a steady state is more easily reached than equilibration duo to the presence of the external driven force .",
    "it is also of interest to know whether the previous picture based on small systems ( @xmath8 ) in the dynamical simulation @xcite is modified on larger systems for the xy case .",
    "on the one hand , the xy spin glass has found experimental realization , not only in layered manganite , e.g. @xmath9 @xcite , but also in high - t@xmath1 cuprate superconductors with the d - wave paring symmetry @xcite , which can be regarded a random distribution of @xmath10 junctions@xcite .",
    "the nature of d - wave symmetry will changes the sign of the coupling between xy spins , while the spin angle denotes the phase of the superconducting order parameters .",
    "so the xy spin glass is expected to be used to interpret the phenomena observed in high - t@xmath1 cuprate superconductors , such as vortex glass phase@xcite , a true superconducting state with vanishing linear resistivity .",
    "the evidences to support the existence of this phase have been reported in many experiments@xcite .",
    "since the chiral variable in the xy spin glass can be defined as the vortex in the plaquette@xcite , some techniques developed in superconducting vortex models@xcite can be in turn employed to characterize the nature of the low temperature ordered state in the xy spin glass . as is well known , in the random pinning environment",
    ", the energy landscape for the vortex motion is highly nontrivial .",
    "the theoretical understanding for the nonlinear dynamics response has been advanced in many years@xcite .",
    "but the full theoretical study is still very challenging , computer simulations are hopeful to provide useful insights .    in this paper , by resistively - shunted - junction dynamics , we perform large - scale dynamical simulations in the 3d spin glass , both the phase - coherence transition temperature @xmath11 and the critical exponents are estimated .",
    "the depinning transition at zero - temperature and creep motion below @xmath11 are also investigated .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.ii describes the model and dynamic method .",
    "sec.iii presents our main results , where some discussions are also performed .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 3d xy spin glass in the phase representation is given by @xcite @xmath12 where the sum is over all nearest neighbor pairs on a 3d square lattice , @xmath13 specifies the phase of the superconducting order parameter on grain @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the strength of josephson coupling between neighboring grains with zero mean and standard deviation unit .",
    "the present simulations are performed with the lattice size @xmath16 for all directions , considerably larger than those in literature .",
    "the resistivity - shunted - junction dynamics is incorporated in simulations , which can be described as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the external current which vanishes except for the boundary sites .",
    "the @xmath19 is the thermal noise current with zero mean and a correlator @xmath20 . in the following ,",
    "the units are taken of @xmath21 .    in the present simulations ,",
    "a uniform external current @xmath22 along @xmath23-direction is fed into the system , the fluctuating twist boundary condition @xcite is applied in the @xmath24 plane , and the periodic boundary condition is used in the @xmath25 axis . in the @xmath24 plane ,",
    "the supercurrent between sites @xmath14 and @xmath26 is now given by @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the fluctuating twist variable and @xmath29 .",
    "the new phase angle @xmath30 is periodic in both @xmath23- and @xmath31-directions .",
    "dynamics of @xmath32 can be then written as @xmath33-i_{\\alpha } , \\alpha = x , y \\label{delta - dot}\\ ] ] the voltage drop is @xmath34 .",
    "the above equations can be solved efficiently by a pseudo - spectral algorithm @xcite due to the periodicity of phase in all directions .",
    "the time stepping is done using a second - order runge - kutta scheme with @xmath35 .",
    "our runs are typically @xmath36 time steps and the latter half time steps are for the measurements . our results are based on one realization of disorder .",
    "the present system size is much too larger than those reported in literature , a good self - averaging effect is expected .",
    "we have performed an additional simulations with a different realization of disorder for further confirmations , and observed quantitatively the same behavior .",
    "note that it is practically hard to perform any serious disorder averaging for the present very large system size .",
    "first , we study the phase - coherence transition .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics are simulated at various temperatures ranged from [ 0.2 , 0.6 ] . at each temperature",
    ", we try to probe the system at a current as low as possible .",
    "the voltage is determined when a steady state is arrived .",
    "1 demonstrates the resistivity @xmath37 as a function of current @xmath38 at various temperatures .",
    "it is clear that , at lower temperatures , @xmath39 tends to zero as the current decreases , which follows that there is a true superconducting phase with zero linear resistivity . while @xmath39 tends to a finite value at higher temperatures , corresponding to an ohmic resistivity .",
    "these observations provide a strong evidence of occurrence of a phase - coherence transition at finite temperature in the 3d xy spin glass in the dynamical sense .    for a continuous phase transition characterized by the divergence of the characteristic length and time scales @xmath40 ( z is the dynamic exponent ) ,",
    "fisher , fisher , and huse @xcite proposed the following dynamic scaling ansatz @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dimension of the system ( @xmath43 in this paper ) , and @xmath44 is the correlation length which diverges at the transition .",

    ", width=264 ]    to extract the critical behavior from the numerical results of the current - voltage characteristics , we will also perform a dynamical scaling analysis . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , using @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , an excellent collapse is achieved according to eq .",
    "( [ ffh ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is by no means close to the ising value @xmath52@xcite , demonstrating the xy and ising spin glass belong to different universality classes .",
    "the finite - size effect is particularly significant at temperatures sufficiently close to @xmath53 when the correlation length exceeds the system size .",
    "for the temperatures considered and the very lattice size @xmath16 here , we believe that the finite - size effect is negligible in the present simulations . to confirm this point",
    ", we perform particular simulations right at @xmath54 obtained above for different system size . at @xmath11",
    ", the correlation length is cut off by the system size in any finite system , the scaling form ( [ ffh ] ) for @xmath43 becomes @xmath55 as shown in fig .",
    "3 , a good collapse is shown using @xmath56 .",
    "this consistence demonstrates that the estimate from fig .",
    "2 is reliable .",
    "therefore a new evidence of a finite - temperature phase - coherence transition is provided convincingly in the 3d xy spin glass .     according to eq .",
    "( [ ffhtg]).,width=264 ]    the above obtained @xmath53 and static exponent @xmath57 are consistent with @xmath58 and @xmath59 obtained in equilibrium monte carlo simulations@xcite for lattice sizes up to @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , the data for the spin - glass and chiral - glass correlation length at larger sizes show marginal behavior , indicating that the lower critical dimension is close to @xmath60 for both spins and chiralities@xcite . the crossing temperatures for the spin and chiral - glass correlation length decrease very slightly with the size with large uncertainties , close to @xmath61 for largest lattice sizes they can simulate . the data for",
    "the ratio of the chiral and spin - glass correlation for the largest sizes intersects for @xmath62 about @xmath63 and then splay out in the low temperature side .",
    "the size dependence of the crossing temperature at large sizes is very weak , supporting a single transition for both spins and chiralities .",
    "interestingly , this crossing temperature is in excellent agreement with the present @xmath53 for a very large lattice size .",
    "we do not think it is a coincidence .",
    "previous driven monte carlo dynamical simulation on the same model for a small lattice size ( @xmath4 ) @xcite estimated @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , basically consistent with the present ones .",
    "it follows that the results are not sensitive to the system size in the dynamical simulations , even the detailed dynamics is different .",
    "the monte carlo dynamical simulations in the vortex representation also show an equilibrium transitive transition@xcite .",
    "the estimated value for @xmath67 agrees with the present one .",
    "but the dynamic exponent @xmath68 is obvious lower , indicating different dynamic universality class for the xy spin glass in the phase and vortex representations .",
    "typical values of the correlation length exponent and the dynamical exponent extracted from the various experiments on high - t@xmath1 cuprate superconductors@xcite fall in the range of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "our results for these static and dynamic exponents in the xy spin glass are consistent with these experimental ones .",
    "in addition , nonlinear resistivity measurement in the @xmath71 bulk sample@xcite near the onset of the paramagnetic meissner effect have been interpreted as a chiral - glass transition owing to the presence of @xmath10 junctions .",
    "the nonlinear contribution @xmath72 to the resistivity was observed to have a peak at the transition with power - law behavior @xmath73 and exponent @xmath74 , which has been reproduced by a generalized xy spin glass model@xcite .",
    "granato proposed that it could also be interpreted as a consequence of the underlining phase coherence transition and the exponent @xmath75 is determined by the dynamic exponent through @xmath76@xcite . by the above",
    "obtained dynamic exponent , we have @xmath77 , compatible with the experimental value within the error bar .",
    "note that the present value of @xmath25 in the large - scale simulations is smaller than those previously given by granato@xcite by about @xmath78 , so our estimated @xmath75 is more close to experimental one .",
    "based on the above comparisons with experiments , we propose that the xy spin glass gives an effective description of the transport properties near the phase - coherence transition in d - wave superconductors .    until now , at least there is a general consensus in 3d xy spin glass that the chiral - glass transition occurs at a finite temperature larger than or equal to the spin - glass transition temperature @xmath11 @xcite . the data for the chiral correlation length in the recent large - scale equilibrium monte carlo simulations@xcite reveals that the chiral - glass transition temperature is around @xmath79 , not larger than the present spin - glass transition temperature .",
    "we therefore suggest that the spin and the chirality probably order simultaneously .",

    "the current - voltage characteristics is rounded near the zero - temperature critical current due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "an obvious crossover between the depinning and creep motion can be observed around @xmath86 at the lowest accessible temperatures . in order to address the thermal rounding of the depinning transition ,",
    "fisher@xcite first suggested to map this system to the ferromagnet in fields where the second - order phase transitions occur .",
    "this mapping was latter extended to the random - field ising model@xcite , flux lines in type - ii superconductors@xcite , and josephson junction arrays@xcite .",
