    "shape memory alloys ( smas ) , due to their two important characteristics , shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity , have broad applications ( see duerig et al 1990 , otsuka and wayman 1998 ) .",
    "to understand the behaviour of this type of materials , systematic experiments have been carried out on uniaxial tension of superelastic niti ( a kind of smas ) wires , strips and tubes ( see shaw & kyriakides 1995 , 1997 , 1998 , sun et al 2000 , tse & sun 2000 , feng & sun 2006 , chang et al 2006 ) . an experimental vedio on the tension of a niti strip by q. p. sun s group can be found in the website : www.me.ust.hk/meqpsun/vedio/tension-strip.htm . among many important observations in these experiments ,",
    "some key features are the various instability phenomena associated with stress - induced phase transitions .",
    "for example , for the stress - induced phase transitions in a strip during a loading process , at least three instability phenomena were observed ( see shaw & kyriakides 1998 , sun et al 2000 , tse & sun 2000 ) : ( i ) a stress drop after the nucleation of the martensite phase and associated with it there is a formation of two phase fronts , which manifest like a neck ( a necking - type instability ) ; ( ii ) the phase front inclines an angle with the strip axis ( a shear - type instability ) ; ( iii ) the front can switch the inclination to an opposite angle .",
    "finite element simulations have been carried out ( see shaw & kyriakides 1998 , shaw 2000 ) to capture the main features observed in experiments .",
    "the numerical results in these two papers revealed some important information about the stress - induced phase transitions in strips .",
    "for example , it was found that the evolution of phase transition events is strongly influenced by overall geometric ( structural ) effects .",
    "the results of these two papers strongly suggest that continuum level events remain dominant players in the smas considered by them .    motivated by the experimental and numerical results by others mentioned above , in this paper we shall study instability phenomena during the phase transitions in a strip _ analytically_. we model this problem in a continuum three - dimensional setting with a no - convex strain energy function , in view of the results of shaw & kyriakides ( 1998 ) ( cf . the last sentence of the paragraph above ) .",
    "the difference between the stress - strain relation used in this paper and shaw & kyriakides ( 1998 ) is that the former is a cubic nonlinear curve while the latter is a trilinear one .",
    "the nonlinearity could play certain role ( see , fig .",
    "8 of shaw 2000 ) . since in the experiments ,",
    "the maximum strain is less than @xmath0 , keeping the nonlinearity up to the third order ( see ( 2.3 ) ) is accurate enough , at least not worse than a trilinear approximation .",
    "we also point out that here the intention is to study macroscopic instability phenomena in the loading process only and no attempt is made to consider the microscopic effects .    analytical results , if achievable , have a number of advantages .",
    "one is that there is no need to introduce an artificial imperfection to capture the post - bifurcation mode .",
    "secondly , mathematically , an instability is caused by the fact that there are multiple solutions , and analytical results can shed light on how this situation arises and help to understand the mechanism .",
    "thirdly , from the analytical results one can see more clearly the roles played by various parameters ( for the present problem , in particular , the geometric parameters , e.g. the thickness and the width ) .",
    "indeed , the analytical results obtained in this paper reveal more explicitly the important role of the thickness of the strip and show that the width influences the instability phenomena through the thickness - width ratio rather its magnitude .",
    "as pointed out in shaw & kyriakides ( 1998 ) , in the macroscopic scale there are many similarities between stress - induced transformations in a sma and the development of luders bands in a mild steel . in the literature , there are different views whether the luders band is caused by microscopic effects or macroscopic effects ( see estrin & kubin 1995 ) . here , we have shown that the inclination of the transformation front is a phenomenon of localization - induced buckling .",
    "this offers a strong analytical evidence that this phenomenon in a sma , and plausibly the phenomenon of luders bands ( due to the similarities ) , is due to macroscopic effects .    since we formulate this problem in a three - dimensional setting with a nonlinear constitutive relation , the governing field equations are three coupled nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "it is extremely difficult to deduce the post - bifurcation solutions of nonlinear pdes analytically .",
    "fortunately , for the present problem , several quantities are small , e.g. , the thickness , the width , and the maximum strain , which then permit us to use a methodology of coupled series and asymptotic expansions to deduce asymptotic solutions .",
    "this methodology was first introduced to study nonlinear waves in solids ( see dai & huo 2002 , dai & fan 2004 ) .",
    "recently , it has been successfully used to study various instability phenomena in solids ( see dai & cai 2006 , cai & dai 2006 , dai et al 2008 , dai & wang 2008 ) . however , all those problems studied before are essentially two - dimensional . here , for the first time",
    "this methodology is used to study a three - dimensional problem .    the remaining of this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2 , we give the general three - dimensional field equations for a plate .",
    "then , in section 3 , we non - dimensionalize the three - dimensional governing equations to identify the key small variables and small parameters for a thin plate . and",
    "then , by using the smallness of these variables and parameters and a methodology of coupled series and asymptotic expansions , in section 4 we derive the asymptotic two - dimensional equations . by considering the smallness of the width further and using a similar methodology in section 4",
    ", we obtain the quasi one - dimensional asymptotic normal form equations for a thin strip in section 5 .",
    "these normal form equations are then solved analytically in section 6 for an infinitely long strip and the solutions obtained seem to be able to describe many features observed in experiments .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider the deformation of a three - dimensional plate composed of a hyperelastic material .",
    "its thickness is @xmath1 and its width is @xmath2 .",
    "we use the cartesian coordinates @xmath3 ( equivalently @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( equivalently @xmath6 ) to represent a material point in the current and reference configurations , respectively .",
    "the geometry of the object of study is shown in figure 1 .    to ensure phase transitions can take place ,",
    "we suppose that the strain energy function @xmath7 , which is a function of the invariants of the left cauchy - green strain tensor for a homogeneous isotropic hyperelastic material , is non - convex such that there is a local maximum and a local minimum in the uniaxial stress - strain curve under a homogenous constant strain state .",
    "the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the deformation gradient and the components of @xmath10 are @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the components of the displacement vector and @xmath13 are coordinates in the undeformed configuration . if the strains are small , it is possible to expand the first piola - kirchhoff stress components in term of the strains up to any order . due to the complexity of the problem , we shall consider the material nonlinearity up to the third order . the formula containing terms up to the third - order material nonlinearity has been provided in fu and ogden ( 1999 ) as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are incremental elastic moduli , which can be calculated once a specific form of the strain energy function is given .",
    "their expressions can be found in appendix a , where it is also shown that @xmath15 has 4 non - zero members and only two are independent , @xmath16 has 9 non - zero members and only three are independent and @xmath17 has 22 non - zero members and only four are independent . for the convenience of the sequel analysis",
    ", we write out the index @xmath18 explicitly . as a result , from eqs .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) we have @xmath19 the equations of equilibrium are @xmath20 substituting ( [ e2.4 ] ) into ( [ e2.5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 it should be noted that , for an initially isotropic material these terms in the right hand side of ( [ e2.7 ] ) will vanish when the number of index @xmath18 in their all subscripts is odd",
    "( [ e2.6 ] ) are the governing equations for the three unknowns @xmath23 . in order to investigate the instability phenomena",
    ", one needs to study the solution bifurcations of the three - dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde s ) ( [ e2.6 ] ) with the traction free conditions on the top / bottom surfaces and two side surfaces and under proper end conditions .",
    "mathematically , this is a very challenging problem , since there is no available a general method for studying the bifurcations of three - dimensional nonlinear pde s .",
    "here , we shall use a novel approach involving coupled series and asymptotic expansions to derive the asymptotic normal form equations in order to carry out the analysis .",
    "for that purpose , we first non - dimensionalize the governing equations to identify the key small variables and small parameters .",
    "suppose that the loads acting on the boundaries of the plate are symmetrical about the mid plane and therefore the deformation is also symmetrical about this plane .",
    "then , we have @xmath24 based on eq .",
    "( [ e3.1 ] ) , we introduce a transformation @xmath25 the dimensionless quantities are defined through the following scalings : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the length of the plate and @xmath28 is a characteristic displacement in the mid - plane . from ( [ e3.2 ] ) and ( [ e3.3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a small parameter ( i.e. , we are considering a weak nonlinearity ) .",
    "the second - order derivatives can be treated similarly .    substituting ( [ e3.3 ] ) and ( [ e3.4 ] ) into ( [ e2.7 ] ) and ( [ e2.6 ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 @xmath32 where and thereafter the tilde over non - dimensional variables has been dropped for convenience .",
    "the lengthy expressions for @xmath33 ) are omitted although they are needed for the calculations ( interested readers can contact the corresponding author for their expressions ) .",
    "we consider the case that the top and bottom surfaces of the plate are traction - free . by using ( [ e2.4 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath34 where @xmath35",
    ". please note that due to symmetry , the boundary conditions at the bottom surface are automatically satisfied .",
    "( [ e3.5 ] ) and ( [ e3.6 ] ) provide the governing equations for three unknowns @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the boundary conditions are ( [ e3.7 ] ) and ( [ e3.9 ] ) .",
    "however , they still comprise a formidable system of nonlinear pde s to be analyzed directly .",
    "to go further , we assume that the plate is thin .",
    "then @xmath38 is a small parameter and @xmath39 is a small variable .",
    "it is clear that the unknowns are functions of the spatial variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the small variable @xmath42 and two small parameters @xmath38 and @xmath43 .",
    "next , we shall use the smallness of the variable @xmath42 and two parameters @xmath38 and @xmath43 to derive the asymptotic two - dimensional equations .",
    "* remark : * since the current methodology to deduce the one - dimensional asymptotic normal equations from the three - dimensional nonlinear field equations has not been done before , in the next two sections we shall provide some detailed derivations .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we can write @xmath44 as the variable @xmath42 is small , as long as we assume that the unknowns are sufficiently smooth in @xmath42 , we can take the series expansions in @xmath42 for the unknowns , i.e. , @xmath45 substituting eq .",

    "* remark : * it is easy to see that these governing equations and boundary conditions have two significant features which are different from the equations for a standard plane - stress problem .",
    "firstly , the out - plane normal strain @xmath79 is coupled with the in - plane displacement components @xmath50 . and secondly , there are some @xmath38 terms and the orders of the derivatives of these terms are two - order higher than the other terms , which indicate the influence of the thickness of the plate .",
    "we shall see later that the thickness has an important influence on the bifurcations .",

    "the thickness of the strip in the current configuration is illustrated by flood contours .",
    "it should be noted that they represent six different modes and do not need to appear consecutively .    from figure 3",
    ", it can be seen that the transformation fronts are inclined with the strip axis . for @xmath281 , the inclined directions are the same and the position of the turning point @xmath287 is about @xmath288 ( roughly speaking , @xmath287 represents the position of the transformation front ) . for @xmath282 ,",
    "the inclined directions are opposite and the position of the turning point @xmath287 is about @xmath289 . in experiments it is found that , accompanying the formation of two phases , there is a stress drop ( @xmath290 ) and the phase fronts become inclined in the same direction ( a shear instability ) . and",
    "then with the developing of the high - strain phase , the propagating phase front can become inclined in the opposite direction ( orientation instability ) .",
    "our analytical results seem to capture these features .",
    "the results obtained here shows that the inclination of the transformation front ( shear instability ) is a phenomenon of phase - transition - induced buckling .",
    "when the phase transition happens , there is a localized deformation ( a neck ) . due to that",
    ", the eigenvalue problem ( 6.5 ) has a turning point at @xmath287 , which in turn causes the buckling modes .",
    "usually , for a buckling problem , one often only observes the first mode ( @xmath281 ; the two transformation fronts are parallel ) .",
    "however , in the present problem , the second eigenvalue ( @xmath282 ) is very close to the first eigenvalue .",
    "thus , if there is a slight disturbance , the second mode may appear .",
    "this may explain why the front can switch to an opposite inclination direction .",
    "we also point out that the solutions obtained above are also valid for a semi - infinite strip with the boundary conditions : @xmath291    if we restrict the spatial interval to @xmath292 .",
    "then , the right - half part of figure 3 describes the different modes of a single transformation front , which is initially located near the left end .",
    "this corresponds to one experimental situation in shaw & kyriakides ( 1998 ) ( see fig . 1 of that paper ) .",
    "in order to better understand several instability phenomena observed in experiments in a thin sma strip during the process of stress - induced phase transitions , we carry out an analytical study .",
    "mathematically , it is a very challenging problem as one needs to study the solution bifurcations of nonlinear partial differential equations in order to capture the instability phenomena .",
    "we start from the formulation of the three - dimensional field equations . by using the smallness of the thickness and the maximum strain , through a methodology which combines series expansions and asymptotic expansions ,",
    "we derive the two - dimensional asymptotic equations , which take into account the lateral deformation and satisfy the traction - free boundary conditions up to the right order .",
    "then , by further using the smallness of the width , we derive two one - dimensional asymptotic normal form equations for the phase transition problem in a thin strip .",
    "these two equations are analyzed and we manage to obtain some interesting analytic solutions for an infinite long strip under free - end boundary conditions through the wkb method . our analytical results capture several instability phenomena observed in experiments successfully .",
    "it is shown analytically that the inclination of the transformation front is a phenomenon of localization - induced buckling ( or phase - transition - induced buckling as the strain localization appears due to the phase transition ) .",
    "also , it is demonstrated that there exists a second mode with a stress eigenvalue very close to that the first one .",
    "thus , a slight disturbance could cause a switch from the first mode to the second mode .",
    "this , in turn , implies a switch of the inclination of the transformation front to an opposite direction , which explains the orientation instability .",
    "our results also reveal more explicitly the important role played by the thickness of the strip and show that the width influences the instability phenomena through the thickness - width ratio rather its magnitude . in literature , whether the well - known phenomenon of the luders band in a mild steel is caused by microscopic effects or macroscopic effects is still not completely settled issue . due to the similarities between stress - induced transformations in a sma and the development of luders band in a mild steel ,",
    "the present results also provide a strong mathematical evidence that the formation of the luders band is a phenomenon due to macroscopic effects .    finally , we point out that as a by - product of the present study we have also provided a mathematically consistent derivation of the classical euler buckling equation , without using the ad hoc hypothesis that the bending moment is proportional to the curvature .",
