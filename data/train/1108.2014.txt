    "cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) anisotropy measurements have provided a great insight into the cosmological parameters that define our universe .",
    "obtaining these measurements to ever higher sensitivity is complicated by the presence of contaminating foregrounds , whose physical understanding is therefore critical .",
    "the discovery of a dust - correlated emission mechanism in the frequency range  10  ",
    "100  ghz  @xcite has reignited the study of galactic foregrounds as interstellar medium  ( ism ) emission mechanisms .",
    "this dust - correlated emission , referred to as anomalous microwave emission or microwave excess , represents an additional component of the diffuse emission at microwave wavelengths .",
    "most of our early knowledge of this type of emission has come from statistical analyses of large areas of sky @xcite . in recent years , a few detections from specific types of galactic objects have been reported in the literature , such as hii regions  @xcite , dark clouds  @xcite and molecular clouds  @xcite .    currently , the most popular hypothesis to explain the observed microwave excess is that of electric dipole radiation from rapidly rotating very small dust grains , also commonly referred to as ` spinning dust '  @xcite .",
    "the spinning dust model generates a very distinctive peaked spectrum that rises between @xmath5  10",
    "  30  ghz , which can not be easily reproduced by either free - free or synchrotron emission .",
    "alternative models have been proposed , including hard synchrotron radiation @xcite and magnetic dipole radiation @xcite , however , the spinning dust paradigm is the one that best reconciles model predictions with observations  ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the anomalous emission occurs in the microwave regime , the proposed spinning dust hypothesis implies that the origin of the emission is intrinsically associated with interstellar dust . a number of dust models",
    "have been postulated to explain the infrared  ( ir ) emission in the diffuse ism  @xcite . despite differences between models",
    ", it is generally accepted that the observed ir emission falls into two categories : 1 ) stochastic emission and 2 ) thermal equilibrium emission .",
    "the stochastic emission is attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  ( pahs ) as well as to a population of small carbonaceous dust grains , while the thermal equilibrium emission is likely to be produced by large carbon and silicate dust grains .",
    "pahs , first discovered by  @xcite , are large molecules ( @xmath5  1  nm in diameter ) containing up to a few hundred carbon atoms .",
    "they are believed to be responsible for the broad emission features found in the near - ir spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the small carbonaceous dust grains are @xmath5  2    8  nm in diameter and thought to produce the mid - ir continuum emission . finally , the large carbon and silicate grains , from a few nm to a few hundreds of nm in size , emit continuum radiation at far - ir wavelengths .",
    "current spinning dust models  @xcite attribute the anomalous emission to the smallest dust grains .",
    "given the key role played by dust in the understanding of the microwave excess , an accurate characterisation of the dust properties in regions exhibiting anomalous emission is necessary to shed light on the nature of this effect . in this work we focus on the perseus cloud , which to date is the most compelling example of anomalous emission associated with a specific galactic region .",
    "the perseus molecular cloud complex is a giant molecular cloud chain  @xmath5  30  pc in length , containing a total gas mass of  @xmath5  1.3@xmath610@xmath7  m@xmath8 , and located at a distance of approximately 250  ",
    "350  pc  @xcite .",
    "the perseus cloud is interesting , and hence extensively studied , not only because of its relative proximity , but also because it forms low to intermediate mass stars , thus providing a link between the well known low mass star formation in the taurus molecular cloud and the high mass star formation in the orion molecular cloud . within the cloud is the extended dust structure g159.618.5 .",
    "observations performed as part of the complete survey  @xcite identified g159.618.5 as an expanding hii bubble located on the far side of the cloud . @xcite observed g159.618.5 with the cosmosomas experiment on degree angular scales , and found a rising spectrum between 11 and 16  ghz .",
    "follow - up observations performed by  @xcite with the very small array  ( vsa ) interferometer at 33  ghz on angular scales of  @xmath5  7    40  arcmin , identified five emission features displaying a remarkably high spatial correlation with the mid - ir emission  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mips1-lgeom ] ) .",
    "the perseus cloud has also been selected for extensive investigations of the microwave excess by the  @xcite . by combining the nine _ planck _ frequency bands in the range 28.5    857  ghz with ancillary data , and by subtracting the contaminating contributions arising from free - free emission , thermal dust emission and the cmb , the authors were able to produce an accurate and comprehensive spectrum of the anomalous emission on degree angular scales .",

    "the bright central region of g159.618.5 corresponds to the b0  v star hd 278942 , believed to be responsible for the hii bubble .",
    "the vsa  @xmath9  7  arcmin fwhm synthesized beam is displayed in the bottom left - hand corner of the image , and the contours correspond to 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 and 90  per cent of the peak flux , which is 200  mjy  beam@xmath10 . ]",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : spitzer ] introduces the _ spitzer _ data used in this analysis and describes the data reprocessing . in section  [ sec : dustem ] we combine the  _ spitzer _ data with a dust emission model  ( dustem ) to characterise the emission properties of the cloud . in section  [ sec : spinning ] we use the results of the dust modelling to characterise the spinning dust emission and we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to characterise the dust properties across the perseus cloud and investigate the link with the anomalous emission mechanism , we used multi - band ir data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ , taken as part of the ` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '  ( c2d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) _ spitzer _ legacy program .",
    "the principal aim of the c2d program is to investigate the formation process of stars and planets , from prestellar cores to planet - forming disks . to achieve this goal , the c2d program involved both photometric and spectroscopic observations of five nearby molecular clouds , including the perseus cloud .",
    "the photometric data are from the multi - band imaging photometer for _ spitzer _  ( mips ;  @xcite ) and the infrared array camera  ( irac ;  @xcite ) while the spectroscopic observations were carried out with the infrared spectrograph  ( irs ;  @xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we limit our analysis to the mips and irac data , which provide a coverage of the perseus cloud comparable to the vsa 33  ghz observations .    modelling the dust properties in the diffuse ism",
    "depends critically on the quality of the ir observations .",
    "it is therefore crucial that we minimise any systematic effects that could potentially bias the analysis .",
    "possible systematics in the _ spitzer _ data include stripes , gaps or artifacts , point sources and contamination from zodiacal light .",
    "both the point sources and zodiacal light contamination are more pronounced at the shorter _ spitzer _ wavelengths .",
    "the density of sources increases with decreasing wavelength , while the zodiacal light peaks around 10    20  @xmath11 m  @xcite , where its contribution can be comparable to the diffuse ism emission.@xmath12 m . ] for these reasons , we decided to reprocess both the irac and mips data .",
    "such a reprocessing , in particular for the mips data , benefited from the techniques recently developed by the mipsgal ( ` a 24 and 70  @xmath11 m survey of the inner galactic disk with mips ' ) _ spitzer _ legacy program team  @xcite , which have been optimised for the treatment of extended emission in highly structured background regions such as the galactic plane and the perseus cloud .",
    "we note that , for our reprocessing , we used , respectively , versions s16 and s14 of the _ spitzer _ science center  ( ssc ) pipeline for the mips and irac basic calibrated data  ( bcds ) . the c2d analysis was instead carried out with version s13 .",
    "the reprocessing of the photometric _ spitzer _ mips and irac data is described in sections  [ sec : mips ] and  [ sec : irac ] , respectively .",
    "the mips instrument observes at three bands centred on 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath11 m , with angular resolutions of 6 , 19 and 40  arcsec , respectively .",
    "table  [ table : mips_summary ] lists the mips data used in this analysis .",
    "only the c2d astronomical observation requests  ( aors ) that provided coverage of the vsa 33  ghz observations were selected .",
    "the 24  @xmath11 m data required minimal reprocessing , while the 70 and 160  @xmath11 m data , had to be substantially reprocessed .",
    "the difference in data quality between 24  @xmath11 m and 70 and 160  @xmath11 m is caused by the different detector materials : the 24  @xmath11 m detector is a si : as array , while the 70 and 160  @xmath11 m detectors are ge : ga arrays . in particular , the responsivity of the ge :",
    "ga arrays varies significantly with the build - up of charge from cosmic ray hits , while the si : as array is less sensitive to this effect  @xcite .      at 24  @xmath11 m , all the mips first frames have a shorter exposure time",
    "this results in a @xmath5  10    15  per cent suppression of the signal in the first frame .",
    "this effect also affects the second and third frames , although to a lesser extent , with a  @xmath5  2  per cent suppression . for this reason ,",
    "the first three frames of each observation were discarded .",
    "this removal had no significant impact on the data as we had sufficiently many frames available to compensate .",
    "after discarding the first three frames , we subtracted the zodiacal light contribution from each bcd using the model by  @xcite , which is implemented in the ssc pipeline .",
    "this model is derived from observations with the diffuse infrared background experiment  ( dirbe ) onboard the _ cosmic background explorer _  ( _ cobe _ ) satellite .",
    "finally , an overlap correction routine , developed for the mipsgal survey  @xcite , was applied to match the background level of all the bcds .",
    "the final mosaic was produced by combining the individual bcds using the ssc mosaicker and point source extractor ( mopex ) software package .",
    ".summary of the mips observations used in the present analysis .",

    "@xmath14  units of declination are degrees , arcminutes and arcseconds . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the recent investigation by the  @xcite finds that the anomalous emission in the perseus cloud can be accurately modelled by spinning dust emission arising from two gas components : a high density molecular gas component and a low density atomic gas component .",
    "the results of our analysis can also be explained in terms of the spinning dust paradigm .",
    "since we find that there is no apparent significant variation in the abundances of pahs and vsgs between regions with and without anomalous emission , the grain excitation mechanism will be the most important factor in producing spinning dust emission .",
    "the enhancement in @xmath0 in regions of anomalous emission will result in a higher density of photons which , in turn , will increase the photon    grain interactions , hence producing more excitation that could cause the dust grains to spin .    with the vsa ,  @xcite found that the measurable microwave  ",
    "ir correlation is restricted to the dense knots located along the shell of the hii bubble g159.618.5 and the open cluster ic  348 .",
    "it is known that the radiation pressure within expanding hii regions sweeps up the surrounding dust forming a photo dissociation region  ( pdr ;  @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the knots of anomalous emission observed with the vsa along the shell are originating from the pdr surrounding the hii gas , excited by the central b0  v star hd  278942 . as an open cluster",
    ", we expect an increase in the strength of the isrf observed towards ic  348 due to the presence of young stellar objects that are known to reside there  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus possibly providing the source of excitation required to produce the observed anomalous emission in ic  348",
    ". both of these scenarios are consistent with our results of finding an enhancement in @xmath0 in regions with anomalous emission , indicating that @xmath0 , and hence photon    grain interactions ,",
    "play a vital role in the excitation of the dust grains .",
    "the @xcite results show in particular that the bulk of the anomalous emission is associated with the dense molecular gas component , and in such dense environments , gas  ",
    "grain collisions are the predominant excitation mechanism of the dust grains .",
    "however , it must be remembered that the vsa is an interferometer , and as such it automatically filters out large scale structures , implying that the anomalous emission detected by the vsa is different to that detected by _",
    "planck_. in fact ,  @xcite calculated that the vsa only observes approximately 10  per cent of the total 33  ghz emission while _ planck _",
    "is sensitive to the entire cloud . given that the star formation efficiency in the perseus cloud is only 2.6  per cent  @xcite , the bulk of the cloud would appear to be quiescent    a result which is consistent with the anomalous emission detected by _",
    "being due to a dense molecular gas component .",
    "moreover , the difference in the angular responses of the vsa and _ planck _ would seem to explain why @xmath0 appears to play an important role for the anomalous emission observed with the vsa , but not for the _ planck _ observations at degree angular scales .",
    "anomalous emission has been observed in a number of hii regions  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , the observations lack the resolution to resolve their structure , thereby making it difficult to determine the exact location from which the emission is originating .",
    "g159.618.5 just happens to be large enough that the vsa observations can resolve the hii region interior and identify that the anomalous emission is indeed produced in the pdr .",
    "the idea of anomalous emission originating from a pdr is not new , as    for instance  ",
    "anomalous emission has previously been observed in a pdr in the @xmath15  ophiuchi molecular cloud  @xcite .    to further constrain the spinning dust emission model",
    ", we decided to combine the parameter values obtained with dustem with spdust  @xcite , a software package that computes a spinning dust spectrum for a set of user defined input parameters .",
    "here we focus on @xmath0 as we have already shown that this parameter is enhanced in regions of anomalous emission . taking the value of @xmath0 for each of the thirteen regions listed in table  [ table : final_params ] and adopting all other spdust parameters used by the  @xcite for the perseus cloud  ( n@xmath3  =  250  @xmath16 , t@xmath17  =  40  k , n@xmath18/n@xmath3  =  1.12@xmath610@xmath19 , n@xmath20/n@xmath3  =  1@xmath610@xmath19 ,",
    "2n@xmath21/n@xmath3  =  1 ) , we estimated the corresponding spinning dust curves .",
    "furthermore , we used our values of @xmath0 in combination with the idealised environmental parameters for other phases of the ism derived by  @xcite , to compute spinning dust curves for a dark cloud  ( dc ) , cold neutral medium  ( cnm ) , warm neutral medium  ( wnm ) , warm ionised medium  ( wim ) , reflection nebula  ( rn ) and  pdr . in this work we used the updated version of spdust as described by  @xcite , which assumes that the grains are randomly orientated with respect to their angular momentum axis",
    "the computed spinning dust curves for one of the regions with anomalous emission  ( region e ) are displayed in fig .  [ fig : spinning_dust ] along with the spinning dust emissivity of the anomalous emission observed with the vsa  @xcite .",
    "region e was chosen as it corresponds to the location of the peak anomalous emission detected by the vsa .",
    "values constrained with dustem for region e and idealised values for all other parameters . also plotted is the spinning dust emissivity computed from the vsa observations .",
    "this shows that the modelled spinning dust curves are not consistent with the vsa observations , and that @xmath0 alone provides very little constraint on the computed spinning dust emission .",
    "this highlights the need for more constraint on the other spdust parameters.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    from fig .",
    "[ fig : spinning_dust ] it is clear that the spinning dust models for each of the phases of the ism are not consistent with the vsa measurement , with the model for the wnm representing the best agreement .",
    "although we are using the values of @xmath0 that we have derived in this analysis , we believe that the reason for this lack of agreement is because the other idealised values for the environments are not physically representative of the region .",
    "for instance , the idealised value of @xmath0 for the  @xcite pdr model is 3@xmath610@xmath22 , which is clearly not consistent with the values of @xmath0 obtained in this work  ( see table  [ table : final_params ] ) , suggesting that the other idealised environmental values are also not appropriate .",
    "the result for the other regions of anomalous emission is similar , implying that to fit the observations we need more constraints on the other parameters within spdust , rather than using idealised values .",
    "values constrained with dustem and the idealised parameters for the wnm  ( _ top _ ) . the difference in these spinning dust curves relative to region a  ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "this shows clearly , that even in regions with no anomalous emission , the modelled spinning dust emissivity is similar to regions in which we detect anomalous emission .",
    "this implies that these modelled curves can not explain the observed emissivity variations , and once again highlights the complexity of this emission mechanism.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we also find that even in regions where we do not detect any anomalous emission , the modelled spinning dust emissivity is similar to regions where we do detect anomalous emission .",
    "this idea is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emiss_wnm ] where the modelled spinning dust emissivity for the wnm is plotted for all thirteen regions : remarkably , the computed spinning dust curves have very little dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "this highlights that , although @xmath0 was found to play a significant role in the excitation process of the dust grains , the strength of the isrf alone is not enough to accurately constrain the spinning dust emission and distinguish between regions with and without anomalous emission .",
    "this , in turn , once again emphasises the complex nature of this emission mechanism and demonstrates that other parameters , not yet constrained by this analysis , may play a bigger role .",
    "this work represents the first attempt to characterise the anomalous emission by using ir observations to constrain the dust properties . by reprocessing the original c2d _ spitzer _ photometric observations of the perseus cloud we have produced maps of a substantially improved quality . using these reprocessed maps and the 2mass / nicer extinction map from the complete survey , in conjunction with the dust emission model dustem",
    ", we have been able to constrain the abundances of the pahs and vsgs relative to the bgs , the strength of the isrf relative to the  @xcite solar neighbourhood value and the thermal equilibrium temperature of the bgs , resulting in parameter maps of the region at 7  arcmin angular scales .",
    "the y@xmath1 , y@xmath2 and @xmath0 parameter maps represent the first of their kind for the perseus cloud .",
    "we found that there is a significant increase in @xmath0 , and consequently t@xmath4 , in regions of anomalous emission .",
    "this result can be interpreted in terms of the spinning dust hypothesis , with the anomalous emission possibly being produced by electric dipole emission from spinning dust grains excited by an increase in photon    grain interactions .",
    "this result also suggests that the spinning dust excitation mechanism plays a vital role in producing the anomalous emission observed with the vsa and as such the emission observed with the vsa is likely originating from the pdr surrounding the hii gas in g159.618.5 , and the open cluster ic  348 .",
    "the results of our analysis also suggest that , due to the difference in the observed angular scales , the anomalous emission detected with the vsa is different to that detected by the  @xcite , which would appear to explain why we find that @xmath0 plays an important role for the anomalous emission observed with the vsa , but not for the _ planck _ observations at degree angular scales .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate the complex nature of the anomalous emission . with more ir observations becoming available  ( e.g. _ herschel _ data )",
