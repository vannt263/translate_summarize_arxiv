    "random variables do not apply when the random variables are correlated @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a surge of interest in evs of _ strongly correlated _",
    "random variables , which is very often the interesting case in statistical physics .",
    "physically relevant examples include for instance the extreme statistics of a stochastic process @xmath20 , with strong temporal correlations , like brownian motion or its variants .",
    "many studies in this context are focused on extremal properties , like the maximum of @xmath20 , over a _ fixed _ time interval , @xmath21 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "however in many cases the length of this time interval is itself a random variable @xmath3 , which can thus vary from one realization of the stochastic process to another .",
    "this time @xmath3 is usually strongly correlated to the process @xmath20 itself .",
    "an interesting situation is the case where @xmath3 is a `` stopping time '' @xcite , i.e. when it is associated to the stopping of the process @xmath20 if a certain event occurs for the first time . for example , in a queuing process starting from an initial queue length @xmath22 , @xmath3 is the time when the queue length @xmath23 becomes zero for the first time ( also called the `` busy period '' ) @xcite . in finance",
    "@xmath3 might correspond to the time when a stock price @xmath24 reaches some specified level for the first time @xcite .",
    "stopping times also naturally arise in various statistical physics models ranging from capture processes @xcite or target annihilating problems @xcite all the way to reaction - diffusion kinetics @xcite or coarsening dynamics of domain walls in ising model @xcite . in the context of stochastic control theory , stochastic processes with `` stopping time ''",

    "`` stopped '' processes involving @xmath37 particles are also interesting and have been considered in the literature .",
    "for instance , the maximal displacement between the  leader \" and the  laggard \" among @xmath0 particles has been studied for @xmath38 particles in ref .",

    "this is precisely the question which we address in this article , by considering non - intersecting brownian motions , which is one of the simplest  though non trivial  interacting particles system .",
    "more precisely , we consider @xmath0 brownian walkers moving on a line with position @xmath43 at time @xmath44 for @xmath45 . they evolve with time according to the langevin equations @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the diffusion constant of the @xmath48 particle and @xmath49 s are independent gaussian white noises .",
    "the initial positions of these particles are @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",

    "here we mainly focus on the pdfs @xmath5 and @xmath60 because @xmath61 and @xmath11 provide characterization of certain geometrical properties of the brownian walker trajectories .",
    "for instance , one may think about @xmath61 as an estimate of the common region visited by all the @xmath0 walkers till the process `` stops '' ( given that all the particles initially started very close to the origin ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath11 characterizes the number of distinct sites visited by the @xmath0 walkers till @xmath3 .",
    "recently we have studied the distributions of the number of distinct sites and common sites visited by @xmath0 independent walkers over a fixed time interval @xmath62 $ ]  @xcite .",

    "but it is a harder problem to solve .",
    "however we show in this paper that the problem with a `` stopping time '' is solvable even in the presence of interactions .",
    "it is also interesting to note that introducing an extra random variable namely the `` stopping time '' @xmath3 renders the problem analytically tractable .    before presenting the details of our calculations , it is useful to give a summary of our results .",
    "we first study the @xmath4 particle problem because it is fully solvable even when the diffusion constants of the two particles are different _ i.e _ @xmath63 and also because the basic concepts are easy to present in this case . solving a backward fokker - planck ( bfp ) equation",

    "to summarize , we have considered the extreme statistics of @xmath0 non - intersecting brownian motions in one dimension ( `` vicious walkers '' ) , till their survival . these brownian particles",
    "`` survive '' over a random time interval @xmath118 $ ] where @xmath3 is usually called the `` stopping time '' .",
    "we consider two different stopping mechanisms named process 1 and process 2 to define @xmath3 . for process 1",
    ", the @xmath0-particle process gets `` stopped '' when either any of the two particles among @xmath0 particles meet each other for the first time before the leftmost one hits the origin or the leftmost particle hits the origin for the first time before any two particles meet each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . on the other hand , for process 2 ,",
    "the `` stopping time '' @xmath3 is determined from the first passage time of the leftmost walker given that no other two particles have met before @xmath3 . for @xmath4 particles ,",
    "we have computed exactly the joint cumulative distribution function @xmath262 of the maxima of the leftmost and rightmost particle till their survival .",
    "this was done by solving a two - dimensional backward fokker - planck equation with the help of a conformal mapping , namely the schwarz - christoffel transformation . from the joint cumulative distribution",
    "we have obtained the marginal pdfs of the maxima of the first and second particle @xmath65 and @xmath320 respectively . for general @xmath0 identical walkers ,",
    "we have computed the tail of the distribution @xmath10 of the global maximum @xmath11 in two ways .",
    "the first one is using a heuristic argument based on the distribution @xmath469 of the `` stopping time '' while the second one is an exact calculation based on @xmath0-particle green s function .",
    "this work raises several interesting questions , which certainly deserve further studies .",
    "the first extension of the present study is the computation of the exponent @xmath96 and the associated amplitude @xmath470 for @xmath81 particles and different diffusion constants .",
    "this is a challenging question from a technical point of view as , in this case , one can not use the karlin - mcgregor formula . in this paper , we have mostly focused on the distribution of the value of the global maximum @xmath11 of @xmath0 non - intersecting walkers till the stopping time @xmath3 .",
    "another interesting observable is not just the actual value of the maximum @xmath11 , but the time @xmath471 at which this maximum occurs before the stopping time @xmath3 .",
    "the pdf of @xmath471 was studied for vicious walkers over a fixed time interval @xcite , with interesting application to stochastic growth processes @xcite , and it will be interesting to study it for the stopped multi - particle process . finally , another interesting open question concerns the distribution @xmath472 of the maximum displacement @xmath61 of the leftmost walker for @xmath81 .",
    "this is an interesting quantity as the maximal displacement @xmath61 travelled by the leftmost particle can be considered , for instance , as a measure of the common region @xcite visited by all the walkers .",
    "we acknowledge support by anr grant 2011-bs04 - 013 - 01 walkmat and in part by the indo - french centre for the promotion of advanced research under project  @xmath473 .",
    "g. s. also acknowledges support from the grant labex palm - randmat .",
    "following the method explained in section [ section3 ] , one can compute the joint cumulative distribution function of @xmath61 and @xmath66 till the stopping time @xmath3 for any diffusion coefficients @xmath476 .",
    "we will not give the details here but only quote the results for the asymptotic behaviors which one can extract from this exact calculation .",
