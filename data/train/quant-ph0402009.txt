    "cooling techniques for atoms play a crucial role in modern physics .",
    "they have allowed for the localisation of atomic gases by weak trapping forces and step by step have enabled the reach into the domain of ultracold gases . at such low temperatures",
    "the peculiar quantum - statistical properties of the atoms become immanent in various effects of cold atomic collisions .",
    "bose - einstein condensation @xcite and the recent production of fermi - dirac degenerate gases @xcite are limiting cases of the now existing experimental feasibilities .",
    "moreover , the implementation of atom - lasers @xcite and microstructured traps on so called atom chips @xcite show the vast potential of applications .    the typical strategy to generate a bose - einstein condensate from a moderately cold sample of trapped atoms is to apply different cooling techniques in sequence : it usually starts with laser cooling @xcite and ends with evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "the latter technique seems to be unbeaten as of yet for the final cooling step .",
    "laser cooling , that relies on cycling transitions where photons are spontaneously emitted , does not provide the ultimate cooling power , due to the reabsorption and scattering of the emitted photons .",
    "however , the drawback of evaporative cooling is well known to be its intrinsic loss of atoms .",
    "since hot atoms are released from the trapping potential to reach a colder sample , a substantial atom loss has to be taken into account that ultimately limits the size of the condensed sample .",
    "furthermore , as does sympathetic cooling @xcite , it requires sufficiently strong atomic collisions for thermal re - equilibration .",
    "given a prepared sample of condensed atoms , a multitude of technical and possibly fundamental noise effects lead to a finite lifetime of the condensate state . among these noise effects",
    "there are collisions with background vapour , electromagnetic noise sources via the trapping potential , scattering of light , etc .",
    "the study of these detrimental disturbances and the development of methods to reduce their impact on the condensate will be a challenging task for the future .",
    "one way to compensate for such heating effects may be simply the continuous application of cooling during the entire experiment .",
    "this may partially compensate the heating and thus extends the lifetime of the condensate .",
    "the only technique working so far at these temperatures is evaporative cooling .",
    "its continuous application , however , would be rather unfortunate for the condensate , since though the lifetime of the condensate may be extended , its size in terms of atom number will continuously decrease .",
    "some years ago , raizen et al .",
    "have proposed the use of stochastic cooling for trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "it is a successful method in high - energy physics @xcite where the transverse motion of a particle beam has to be collimated and cooled",
    ". clearly , the energies involved there are not in the regime important for an application to trapped atoms . however",
    ", classical numerical simulations have shown the feasibility of stochastic cooling also for trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been recently shown , that also at ultralow temperatures this technique reveals cooling @xcite .",
    "thus it may perhaps be utilized to stabilise an atomic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "it should be pointed out that on the single - atom level feedback control of atomic position has been theoretically studied @xcite and experimentally realised in optical lattices @xcite and high - quality cavity fields @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our analysis of stochastic cooling of trapped atoms to include also effects due to the transverse confinement of atoms .",
    "the latter has its origin in the finite beam waist of the employed control - laser beam . at temperatures above the condensation point we give analytic results of the cooling and discuss its optimisation with respect to size and location of the control - laser beam waist .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : non - degenerate - atomic - vapor ] the regime of a non - degenerate gas is considered for which analytical expressions for the energy contributions are obtained .",
    "moreover , the dependence of cooling on geometrical parameters is discussed . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] conclusions are given .",
    "the method of stochastic cooling of trapped atoms consists of the repeated application of two operations : the measurement of the momentum of atoms and the subsequent application of a kick to compensate for the measured momentum .",
    "several aspects are important and should be emphasised for an understanding of the working of this technique .",
    "first of all it is not done on a single atom but on a large set of atoms .",
    "those atoms that are subject to measurement and kick are specified by their spatial location in a given volume of space . in the experiment",
    "that volume is defined by the spatial extent of the laser beams that implement the required operations .    since in the experiment , at the time of measurement of momentum ,",
    "it is usually unknown how many atoms contributed to the measured signal , the momentum per atom averaged over the atomic ensemble is not the measured observable . to obtain this momentum per atom one",
    "would in fact need knowledge on the precise number of atoms , that contributed to the measured signal .",
    "what can , instead , be assessed by the measurement is the total momentum of the atoms .",
    "this is the sum over the atomic momenta , since each atom equally contributes to the signal .",
    "given the measured total momentum of the set of atoms , for compensating it , a ( optical ) field is turned on to provide the necessary kick by its interaction with the atoms .",
    "since each atom separately interacts with the field , one can only apply a common kick to each atom .",
    "the determination of the required kick per atom necessarily involves a characterisation of the number of atoms in the set , given that only the total momentum is known . since the atom number will not be measured , a priori information is required for estimating the actual atom number .",
    "clearly , this way atom - number fluctuations , whether classical or quantum in nature , can not be coped with , which shows an intrinsic source of imperfection of the method .",
    "furthermore , since a measurement on a single system and not a series of measurements on identically prepared systems is performed , not ensemble averages are measured .",
    "depending on the measurement resolution strong correlations between the atoms are induced by the measurement projection , since a huge number of microstates of the atoms may be associated to the same observed measurement outcome , which form a complicated superposition state .      here",
    "we consider a full three - dimensional model and consider spatial confinement of the volume where atoms are manipulated , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . for simplicity",
    "we assume only one laser - beam profile , despite the fact that several laser beams are involved in the implementation of the required operations @xcite .",
    "the control - laser beam is directed along the @xmath0-axis and its transverse profile in @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions is described by the beam - waist function @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 component of the total momentum of atoms inside the beam @xmath4 is measured and then compensated to zero by means of a negative feedback loop . using the atomic field operator @xmath5 for bosonic atoms ,",

    "this allows us to obtain a natural description of cooling in terms of energy @xmath43 that is subtracted or , possibly , added by a feedback operation at a certain temperature point .",

    "these correlations may possibly lead to enhancement of cooling via various effects , as shown in refs  @xcite .",
    "thus the results of this paper , where we assume a thermal equilibrium state , represent the leading cooling / heating mechanisms for the quasi - equilibrium case .",

    "we divide this hamiltonian into parts describing the energy of the motion in @xmath0 direction , i.e. in longitudinal direction with respect to the measured momentum @xmath4 , and into parts related to the energy of the transverse motion in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "the average total energy of the system in a given many - body quantum state can be written as the sum of these different contributions as @xmath47 using the definition of the single - atom density matrix  ( [ eq : single - atom - dm ] ) , the corresponding kinetic parts of eq .",

    "the unidirectional flow of energy from the system to the optical fields is determined by the irreversibility introduced in the quantum measurement process .",
    "apart from that , however , there are several sources of heating , among them also the back - action noise of the measurement itself . especially at ultralow temperatures a decay or even reversal of the net energy flow may be expected , when the detrimental heating terms compensate the sought cooling effect of the momentum shift . in the following",
    "we will extract all these energetic terms by considering the feedback - induced change of energy based on eqs  ( [ eq : e - def])([eq : v - perp - def ] ) .",
    "more specifically , we consider the change of the average energy , i.e. the difference between the energy after a single step of stochastic cooling and that before , @xmath51      the dominant change of energy will occur in the potential and kinetic energies associated with the longitudinal motion in @xmath0 direction . the longitudinal potential energy @xmath52 is given by eq .",

    "after some lengthy but straightforward calculation the following expression for the feedback - induced change of longitudinal kinetic energy is then obtained : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the fluctuation of the actual atom number in the control beam around its average . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dk - parallel ] ) is the kinetic energy left in the system by the imprecise total - momentum measurement with resolution @xmath17 .",
    "the second term is the sought cooling effect , where the centre - of - mass kinetic energy of the affected atoms is removed from the system .",
    "the last term , though , arises from quantum fluctuations of the number of atoms in the control - laser beam .",
    "this heating term appears since in the momentum - shift operation the actual atom number @xmath29 is not known but only estimated by @xmath58 .",
    "thus this term represents a quantum - statistical imperfection of the feedback loop of stochastic cooling .      at first sight",
    "one may guess that the transverse motion is not affected by the feedback loop , since only momentum in @xmath0 direction is measured and shifted .",
    "however , since the atoms that contribute to the measured signal are confined within the laser beam waist @xmath59 , the measurement of @xmath4 also contains an indirect measurement of the transverse position of atoms with a resolution roughly given by the diameter of the beam .",
    "thus a back - action noise in the transverse momenta can be expected that may lead to further contributions to the kinetic energy .",
    "it is now left to show how large these energy contributions are compared with those emerging from the longitudinal motion .    from eqs  ( [ eq : single - atom - density - matrix ] ) and ( [ eq : v - perp - def ] ) it can be easily seen that the potential energy in transverse @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions is unchanged , i.e. @xmath60 this result is obvious since only the momentum in @xmath0 direction with a transverse spatial confinement is measured without affecting the noise in the transverse coordinates .",
