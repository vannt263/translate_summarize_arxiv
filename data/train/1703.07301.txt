    "in this paper we consider the following question : can the edges of every properly edge - coloured complete graph be decomposed into edge - disjoint rainbow spanning trees . here",

    "a rainbow spanning tree in @xmath0 is a tree containing every vertes of @xmath0 , all of whose edges have different colours .",
    "the study of rainbow decompositions dates back to the 18th century when euler studied the question `` for which @xmath4 does there exist a properly @xmath4-edge - coloured @xmath5 which can be decomposed into @xmath4 edge - disjoint rainbow perfect matchings .",

    "together these results give a complete description of the values of @xmath4 for which there exists a properly @xmath4-edge - coloured @xmath5 which can be decomposed into @xmath4 edge - disjoint rainbow perfect matchings .",
    "decompositions of properly @xmath10-edge - coloured @xmath11 into edge - disjoint rainbow perfect matchings have also been studied .",
    "they were introduced by room in 1955,-edge - coloured @xmath11 into edge - disjoint rainbow perfect matchings . ] who raised the question of which @xmath4 they exist for .",

    "however given an _",
    "arbitrary _ proper edge - colouring of @xmath5 or @xmath14 it is not the case that it must have a decomposition into rainbow perfect matchings . a natural way of getting around this is to consider decompositions into rainbow graphs other than perfect matchings . in the past decompositions into rainbow subgraphs such as cycles and triangle factors have been considered  @xcite .",
    "an additional reason to study rainbow subgraphs arises in ramsey theory , more precisely in the canonical version of ramsey s theorem , proved by erds and rado @xcite in 1950 . here the goal is to show that edge - colourings of @xmath0 , in which each colour appears only few times contain rainbow copies of certain graphs ( see , e.g. , introduction of @xcite , for more details ) .    in this paper we consider decompositions into rainbow trees .",

    "if one wants to further improve the bounds on any one of these conjectures , then it is routine to modify our methods to do so .",
    "particularly , we mention that it is possible to obtain quite a good bound on constantine s conjecture by combining the proofs of theorems  [ theorempropercolouring ] and  [ theorem1factorization ] .",
    "this is because the source of the small constant `` @xmath731 '' in theorem  [ theorempropercolouring ] is that the colouring on @xmath0 was a general proper colouring ( rather than a @xmath424-factorization . ) if instead we are in the setting of a @xmath424-factorization ( as in constantine s conjecture ) then it is easy to modify the proof to find around @xmath732 edge - disjoint spanning rainbow isomorphic trees .",
    "the big open problem seems to be to prove some sort of asymptotic version of conjectures conjectures  [ conjecture_brualdi_hollongsworth ]  [ conjecture_constantine ] .",
    "for example does every properly @xmath2-edge - coloured @xmath0 have @xmath733 edge - disjoint spanning rainbow trees ?",
    "a colouring of a graph is @xmath734-bounded if there are @xmath292 edges of each colour .",

    "curiously , theorem  [ theorempropercolouring ] is not true for colourings that are @xmath735-bounded .",
    "in fact , sudakov and volec  @xcite constructed @xmath736-bounded colourings of @xmath0 which contain no spanning rainbow tree of radius @xmath16 . in particular",
    "this implies that there are @xmath736-bounded colourings of @xmath0 without any spanning rainbow spiders .",
    "this shows that if some analogue of constantine s conjecture holds for bounded colourings , then one would need to consider graphs different form spiders .",
    "notice that theorem  [ theorempropercolouring ] is qualitatively stronger than conjecture  [ conjecture_constantine ]  theorem  [ theorempropercolouring ] allows us to specify what spanning rainbow tree we find ( whereas conjecture  [ conjecture_constantine ] only says that we should find isomorphic trees without specifying the isomorphism class of the trees . )",
    "this opens up the intriguing area of what collections of rainbow trees can be found in every properly coloured @xmath0 . in this direction",
    "one can modify the result in this paper to allow us to find several different spiders in a properly coloured @xmath0 .",
    "the proof of the above theorem is identical to the proof of theorem  [ theorempropercolouring ] , except that in the last line of the proof one applies lemma  [ lemmachangedoublestarparameter ] to create @xmath556-spiders rather than @xmath23-spiders .",
    "it would be interesting to know for what other collections of trees @xmath739 the above theorem is true .",
    "this problem may be quite hard , since even for uncoloured complete graphs there are many open problems about finding edge - disjoint trees eg . the gyrfs - sumner conjecture .",
    "a related open problem is `` which rainbow trees can be found in every properly coloured @xmath0 ? '' at first glance , one might hope that for any @xmath4-vertex tree @xmath740 , every properly coloured @xmath0 contains a rainbow copy of @xmath740 .",

    "the authors showed how to find a rainbow path of length @xmath741 in every properly edge - coloured @xmath0 .",
    "based on this , we expect that perhaps for every tree @xmath205 , a rainbow copy of @xmath205 is contained in every properly edge - coloured complete graph with a few more vertices than @xmath205 .",
