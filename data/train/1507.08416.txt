    "this paper is motivated by the desire to develop models to analyze traffic when the roads are wide and the lanes are blurred .",
    "such traffic behavior is not uncommon in many roads in india where , to misquote j k galbraith , a functioning anarchy prevails .",
    "we develop a stylized model to describe the local interaction among the vehicles on such roads and use this microscopic description to characterize the emerging macroscopic behaviour . in effect",
    ", we consider a multilane system except that we assume that there is no strict demarcation of lanes and that vehicles are affected by those in a ` cone ' rather than by the vehicle right ahead . on such roads ,",
    "multiple cars drive abreast but do not adhere to lane discipline . toward this",
    "we adapt the single lane model of @xcite to develop our multilane model .",
    "specifically , a directed graph is used to model the influence on the acceleration of a vehicle by others in its neighbourhood , i.e. , those that are in its cone .",
    "we seek an equilibrium analysis of the dynamical system model that we develop .",
    "our notion of stability refers to the condition that all cars attain the same velocity as the leader . since this is a car following model",
    ", we also have the notion of levels and the analysis will also obtain conditions such that cars in one level maintain a fixed spacing from cars in the next level .",
    "our analysis will primarily use the laplacian of the directed graph that models the influences , which in turn will allow us to dissolve the lanes , so to say .",
    "the influence graph can also be a weighted graph to enable us to model the relative degrees of the influences .",
    "models for vehicular systems have been widely studied both from a microscopic @xcite @xcite as well as from a macroscopic @xcite @xcite perspective .",
    "various forms of stability such as input - to - state @xcite , string stability @xcite and mesh stability have been considered .",
    "mesh stability ensures damping of perturbations in vehicle formations , as they move away from the source @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "various applications are studied namely obstacle avoidance in @xcite and lane changing in @xcite @xcite . in @xcite multilane model for vehicular traffic",
    "is considered and a fluid model is developed .",
    "unlike string or mesh stability theories , where the main concern is magnification of disturbances down infinite chains of cars , in this paper , we study finite number of cars .",
    "while it is relatively easy to show stability properties in this case , we are concerned primarily about equilibrium spacing between the cars .",
    "we show that it is possible , with purely distributed control laws , to achieve and maintain desired spacing , even in an ad - hoc laneless traffic situation under a variety of common traffic conditions and disturbances .    the results presented here , as well as the tools used to derive those results , are heavily dependent on the theory of consensus in multiagent systems ( see e.g @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite and the references therein ) . while @xcite has studied vehicle consensus , @xcite@xcite derived stability conditions for time varying topologies .",
    "most of our analysis depend on these recently developed theories and particularly on @xcite , where arbitrary vehicle formations ( not necessarily unidirectional as in roadways ) have been studied .",
    "we specialize these results for ad - hoc laneless road traffic , and in the process derive distributed control laws that preserve inter - vehicle spacing and stability under time - varying formations , switched influence graphs and impulse changes in driving objectives .",
    "while these properties are hard to derive for general types of motion , it becomes relatively simple here due to typical uni / bi - directional constrained motion possible on roadways .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] we set up the notation and our assumptions on the models for the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 directions .",
    "we then describe the control laws that are used by the vehicles for each of @xmath1 and @xmath0 directions . in section  [ sec : unidirec : motion ] , we analyze the dynamics of motion in the @xmath0 direction and obtain a stability criterion .",
    "we also characterize the influence graph .",
    "a similar analysis is carried out for the @xmath1 direction in section  [ subsec : x : axis : mot : uni ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "time : vary : graph ] we present the analysis when the influence graph varies with time . in section  [ sec : stab : impulse : effect ] we analyze the effects of impulses on the stability of the formation . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : simul ] we present some simulation results .",
    "[ sec : sys : assump ]    as discussed in the introduction , we are interested in analyzing the motion of a finite number of cars along roads which has no lane demarcations . in other words ,",
    "cars can , in principle , occupy arbitrary positions with respect to other cars as long as they do not collide with each other or with the side of the road .",
    "however , all the cars want to travel along the road in one direction and would also like to keep safe a distance from all its neighbours based on visual feedback about the position and velocity of the neighbouring cars .",
    "we name the direction of travel along the road as the @xmath0-axis and the direction perpendicular to the road as the @xmath1-axis .",
    "though in reality , a car s ability to maneuver in these two directions is coupled , for simplicity we assume that the dynamics of each car along these two directions are independent . moreover ,",
    "the control laws for each of these directions consider a different set of influencing neighbours .",
    "this later assumption is realistic since a driver typically looks to the side before moving sideways , while he considers only the cars roughly in front of him for normal forward motion . in effect , the influence graphs for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 directions are different in our calculations .",
    "in addition , we also assume , again for simplicity , that the cars in the formation are identical .",
    "we state the various modeling assumptions along these two directions after a brief description of graph theoretic notation .",
