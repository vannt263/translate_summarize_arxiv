    "the orientation field ( of ) is a crucial ingredient for most fingerprint recognition systems @xcite .",
    "an of is an image ( or matrix ) which encodes at each pixel of the fingerprint foreground @xcite the orientation @xmath0 degrees ( or @xmath1 in radians ) of a tangent to the ridge and valley flow at location @xmath2 .",
    "modelling and estimating ofs is a fundamental task for automatic processing of fingerprints .",
    "we introduce a locally adaptive global model called the _ extended quadratic differential _ ( xqd ) model .",
    "we show that xqds can model the of of a fingerprint perfectly in the limit .",
    "the major advantage of the xqd model lies in its small number of parameters , each of which has a simple and obvious geometric meaning .",
    "ofs have many important areas of application at various stages of processing fingerprints . in the following part of this section",
    ", we discuss some of the most relevant of these applications .",
    "the rest of this manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ofliterature ] , we review related work from the literature for estimating , modelling and marking ofs of fingerprints . in section [ sec : xqdm ] , we describe the novel xqd model . in section [ convergence ] , we prove that the xqd model adapts perfectly to the of of a real fingerprint in the limit . in section [ sec : results ] , we present practical results for compressing real fingerprint ofs by xqd models .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] with a discussion and we point out topics for future work .",
    "most systems for fingerprint verification and identification are based on minutiae templates .",
    "automatic extraction of minutiae from fingerprints can be a very challenging task for images of low and very low quality .",
    "quality loss of fingerprint images acquired on optical scanners can occur if a finger is too dry , or too wet , or contains scars . putting",
    "a finger with too much or too little pressure on sensor can have similar negative effects on the image quality .",
    "poor image quality can cause a minutiae extraction module to miss some true minutiae and to introduce some spurious minutiae .",
    "the goal of fingerprint image enhancement is to avoid these two types of errors by improving the image quality prior to minutiae extraction .",
    "the most effective approach for fingerprint image enhancement is contextual filtering and the most important type of local context is the of .",
    "for example , oriented diffusion filtering @xcite uses only the of to perform anisotropic smoothing along the ridge and valley flow .",
    "curved regions @xcite are computed based on the of and first , they are used for estimating the local ridge frequency and subsequently , of and ridge frequency estimates are joint inputs for curved gabor filtering @xcite .",
    "these two methods estimate the local context and perform filtering in the spatial domain .",
    "alternatively , methods for contextual filtering of fingerprints can also operate in the fourier domain , see e.g. methods proposed by chikkerur _ et al._@xcite and by bartunek _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "a hybrid approach with processing steps in the spatial and fourier domain has been suggested by ghafoor",
    "_ et al._@xcite .",
    "software - based fingerprint liveness detection strives to classify an input fingerprint as belonging to one of two classes : an image of an alive , real finger or an image of a fake or spoof finger made from artificial material like wood glue , gelatine or silicone .",
    "developing countermeasures against spoof attacks is a very active research area .",
    "two methods apply the of to compute invariant descriptors : for histograms of invariant gradients ( hig ) @xcite , the gradient direction at each pixel is normalized relative to the local orientation .",
    "convolution comparison patterns ( ccp ) @xcite are obtained from small image patches . to that end ,",
    "rotation - invariant patches are computed by locally rotating each window according to the local orientation at that pixel .",
    "fingerprint alteration is another type of presentation attack @xcite in which the attacker has the goal of avoiding identification ( e.g. attempting to not being found in a watchlist search during border crossing or not being identified in a forensic investigation ) .",
    "altered fingerprints often have a disturbed of .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that in recent comparisons of features for alteration detection @xcite , some of the most effective features are related to the of . in a nutshell ,",
    "dofts @xcite and ofa @xcite are based on the difference between an estimated of and a smoother version of it , coh @xcite relies on the coherence of gradients and spda @xcite makes use of the fact that alterations tend to introduce additional singularities into a fingerprint .",
    "orientation descriptors have been proposed by tico and kuosmanen @xcite for computing the similarity between two minutiae from two templates .",
    "these local similarities are aggregated into a global score which summarizes the similarity between both templates .",
    "improvements of fingerprint recognition performance have been observed by using differences between two aligned ofs for score revaluation @xcite : first , two minutiae templates are matched and the output is a global similarity score and a minutiae pairing .",
    "second , the corresponding ofs are aligned , based on the paired minutiae and , the similarity between the ofs is evaluated . on the one hand , if both ofs fit well together , the aligned ofs confirm the minutiae pairing and the global score is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "if major discrepancies between the aligned ofs are observed , this is considered as an indication of a potential impostor recognition attempt and the score is decreased accordingly .",
    "ofs are used for fingerprint alignment ( also known as registration ) , i.e. finding a global rotation and translation of one of with respect to other which is obtained by optimizing a cost function @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite considered in their work the alignment of partial fingerprints from fingermarks to full fingerprints , so called rolled fingerprints which are acquired with the help of e.g. a police officer who rolls the finger of subject to capture the full surface from nail to nail .",
    "similar to above described score revaluation @xcite , they found that of alignment improves the recognition performance , in their case , the rank-1 identification rate .",
    "tams @xcite studied the problem of absolute pre - alignment of a single fingerprint in the context of fingerprint - based cryptosystems @xcite and suggested an of based method .",
    "the goal of classification and indexing is to speed up fingerprint identification ( 1 to n comparisons , where n can be in the magnitude of millions for forensic databases , see chapter 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the class tented arch is observed in about 3% of all fingerprints @xcite . hence , if a query fingerprint belongs to the class tented arch , then the search space can reduced by 97% .",
    "the majority of approaches for classification and indexing relies on ofs , e.g. cappelli _ et al._@xcite proposed a method for fingerprint classification by directional image partitioning . a recent survey by galar _",
    "et al._@xcite lists 128 references and most of them use the of ( or its singular points ) for classification .",
    "the generation of artificial fingerprint images has the advantage that it is possible to create arbitrarily large databases for research purposes e.g. of a million or a billion fingerprints at virtually no cost and without legal constraints .",
    "methods for producing synthetic fingerprints include @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of approaches for constructing and reconstructing fingerprint images can be found in @xcite .",
    "all methods have in common that they require an of for the image creation process . the methods by cappelli _",
    "_ @xcite and by araque _",
    "@xcite rely on the global of model by vizcaya and gerhardt @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the realistic fingerprint creator ( rfc ) @xcite uses of estimations by a combination of gradient - based and line sensor methods @xcite from a database of real fingerprints .      during a forensic investigation , it can occur that traces at a crime scene are detected where two or more latent fingerprints overlap on a surface .",
    "the task is to separate these fingerprints , so that the separated single fingerprints can individually be utilized for identification .",
    "several research groups have addressed this problem in their work , and the key to the solution are in each work the ofs , see e.g. @xcite .    a different forensic problem studied by hildebrandt and dittmann @xcite is latent fingerprint forgery detection . for this application",
    "one may well compute rotationally invariant features such as hig @xcite or ccp @xcite by taking the orientation flow at the latent fingerprint into account .",
    "considering the importance of the of , it is no surprise that a large body of literature is treating the topic of automatic of estimation .",
    "a classic approach is to estimate the of by some form of averaging ( squared ) image gradients ( computed e.g. using the sobel filter ) or symmetry features , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , this works only for good quality images .",
    "further approaches include complex 2d energy operators @xcite . for dealing also with medium and low - quality fingerprint images ,",
    "the line sensor method @xcite was developed which recently has been adapted to detect the oriented filaments in microscopy images @xcite .",
    "a dictionary based method @xcite has been proposed for estimating the of in latent fingerprints .",
    "many additional references can be found in @xcite and chapter 3 of @xcite .",
    "the zero - pole model has been introduced by sherlock and monro in 1993 @xcite .",
    "the flow fields generated by the zero - pole model resemble in some generality ofs of fingerprints , however they deviate significantly from ofs of a real finger .",
    "vizcaya and gerhardt improved the simple zero - pole model in 1996 @xcite by suggesting an additional nonlinear bending scheme to better fit the of generated by their model to real ofs .",
    "a global model based on quadratic differentials ( qd ) has been proposed by huckemann _",
    "et al . _ in 2008 @xcite .",
    "the zero - pole model is a special case of this more general model which has five geometrically interpretable parameters .",
    "the qd model better fits real ofs especially for the fingerprint of the type arch .",
    "further global models include the work by ram _ et al._@xcite who apply legendre polynomials for of modelling .",
    "there are two main motivations for manually marking information in fingerprints .",
    "the first is the creation of ground truth information which can be used for evaluating the performance of human experts and algorithms regarding the estimation or extraction of the target information .",
    "and the second use case is the labeling for ( semi)automated retrival of information such as the foreground region , singular points , orientations or minutiae for fingerprint images which are too difficult for automatic processing by current state - of - the - art automatic fingerprint identification systems ( afis ) software .",
    "forensic examiners mark such information in latent fingerprints to identify suspects in criminal investigations .",
    "advancements in latent fingerprint recognition have the goal of minimizing the time and effort required by human experts for successful identifications .      in order to compare the performance of different of estimation methods ,",
    "1782 orientations at specific locations in various fingerprints in have been manually marked by gottschlich _",
    "_  in @xcite with a focus on low - quality regions affected by noise .",
    "et al._@xcite addressed the problem of enhancing very low - quality fingerprints and suggested to manually mark the ofs used for contextual filtering .",
    "they proposed to mark local orientations , compute the delaunay triangulation and interpolate the orientation at unmarked pixel locations inside a triangle from the marked orientations at the three vertices of triangle .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is that a large number of small triangles is required to approximate the true orientation in highly curved regions around singular points .",
    "et al._@xcite and turroni _",
    "et al._@xcite created a ground truth benchmark called foe following the same marking strategy ( 10 good and 50 bad quality prints ) .",
    "they compared the of estimation performance of several algorithms from literature on this benchmark .",
    "the foe benchmark has recently also been used for evaluating the performance of methods which reconstruct ofs from minutiae @xcite . in our work , of compression results using the foe benchmark",
    "are reported in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we note that xqd models can be used as an alternate interpolation method not suffering from the need of large numbers of support points at high curvature near singularities .",
    "latent fingerprint recognition is still considered to be a difficult problem .",
    "the level of noise for some fingermarks from crime scenes can be high and depending the surface from which fingermarks are lifted ( or directly photographed ) , a complex background can make the recognition task far more difficult in comparison with the processing fingerprints captured by a fingerprint sensor .",
    "typical first steps , among them fingerprint segmentation @xcite and of estimation , are challenging .",
    "recently , a novel image decomposition technique called dg3pd has been introduced which can better cope with these challenging images , see figures 9 and 10 in @xcite .",
    "the goal of fully automatic latent fingerprint identification has not yet been achieved .",
    "even state - of - the - art commercial latent identification software fails for a considerable amount of images and information still has to be manually marked by forensic experts in these cases .",
    "e.g. in a work by yoon _",
    "et al._@xcite , information about the region - of - interest ( roi ) , the location of singular points and the orientation at some sparse locations is still assumed to be manually marked . in the light of these problems ,",
    "a subordinate target is to minimize the time and effort required by a human experts and the xqd model proposed in our work approach can be instrumental in achieving this .",
    "forensic and governmental databases can contain millions of fingerprint images .",
    "storing large volumes of data efficiently is a key issue which can be addressed by image compression @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite suggested to utilize the of for improving lossless fingerprint image compression .",
    "more specifically , they suggest to increase redundancy by scanning pixels along the orientation , instead of standard procedures like horizontal ( row by row ) or vertical scanning of images .",
    "larkin and fletcher @xcite proposed a method for lossy fingerprint image compression by decomposing an image into four elemental images which are highly compressible .",
    "one of these four images , called the continuous phase , can be converted into an of and vice versa . both approaches by thrn _",
    "et al._@xcite and by larkin and fletcher @xcite can profit from improvements of the of compression by our xqd models .",
    "if in an application e.g. by a law enforcement agency , fingerprint images and their minutiae templates are stored together , an straightforward idea would be to reconstruct the of from the minutiae template . however , a recent evaluation of of reconstruction methods @xcite showed that all existing methods have weaknesses , and especially in proximity to singular points , all methods tend to be very inaccurate . in an analogy",
    ", minutiae templates can viewed as a form of lossy fingerprint image compressions .",
    "a survey of methods for reconstructing fingerprint images from minutiae templates can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , shao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied fingerprint image compression by use of dictionaries of fingerprint image patches .",
    "an additional discussion of texture image compression can be found in section 7.3 in @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of xqd models for of compression will be detailed in sections [ sec : ofcompression ] and [ sec : results ] .",
    "our methods for manually marking and automatically compressing fingerprint ofs are based on the _ quadratic differential _ ( qd ) model of huckemann _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "consequently , we shall outline that model first .",
    "the basis of this model is given by a model for the arch type fingerprint .",
    "adding given singular point coordinates , _ i.e. , _ cores and delta , this can be generalized to model the other fingerprint types .",
    "the of of an arch type fingerprint is roughly controlled by two parameters : given a cartesian coordinate system @xmath3 in complex coordinates @xmath4 , the of is linked to the following complex function @xmath5 for @xmath6 and , otherwise , @xmath7 , as follows .",
    "the orientation angle at the coordinate @xmath3 can be obtained by @xmath8 with the main branch of the argument of a complex number taking values in @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 controls the coordinates of two singularities @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( 2nd order zeroes of @xmath13 ) along the abscissa and @xmath14 is a factor controlling vertical stretching . in fig .",
    "[ fig : arch ] a reasonable fit of the qd model to an arch type fingerprint is visualized where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the rotation and translation of the coordinate system have been adjusted .",
    "fingerprints of other types ( such as loops , double loops , and whorls ) contain an equal number of deltas and cores  where a fingerprint can not contain more than two deltas / cores ; note that a whorl can be considered as a double loop in which the two cores agree or are of small distance .",
    "the following formula extends eq .",
    "( [ eq : arch ] ) to also model an of of a loop type fingerprint of which core and delta coordinates are encoded by the complex @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively : @xmath19 for @xmath6 and , otherwise , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath22 . an of of a loop type fingerprint modeled by the qd model is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] .",
    "similarly , a double loop with complex core coordinates @xmath23 and complex delta coordinates , @xmath24 is modeled by the following : @xmath25 for @xmath6 and , otherwise , @xmath26 . for both models , eq .",

    "( qd ) @xmath28 the solution curves of @xmath29 having the orientations from eq .",
    "( [ eq : qdmangles ] ) .",
    "then , in particular the `` zeroes '' of @xmath13 are in fact poles of the qd and `` poles '' of @xmath13 are zeroes of the qd .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qdm ] , the qd model can be used to quite well approximate the general ridge flow using few parameters only",
    ". however , the reader quickly recognizes areas in which the model significantly deviates from the evident ground - truth ridge flow which is an unavoidable effect due to the fact that @xmath13 in the qd model has only few degrees of freedom .",

    ", we propose to attach a variable number of local correction points to which we refer as _ _ thereby obtaining an _ extended quadratic differential _ ( xqd ) model . with these points the local of modeled by a qd can be corrected to better match with the ridge flow of a fingerprint .",
