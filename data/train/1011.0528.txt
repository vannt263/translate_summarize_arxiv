    "in recent years diffuse interface models have been successfully used to describe the flow of two or more immiscible fluids both for theoretical studies and numerical simulations .",
    "one fundamental advantage of these models is that they are able to describe topological transitions like droplet coalescence or droplet break - up in a natural way . in the case of two incompressible , viscous newtonian fluids",
    "the basic diffuse interface model is the so - called `` model h '' , cf .",
    "hohenberg and halperin  @xcite .",
    "it leads to the navier - stokes / cahn - hilliard system @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the density , @xmath2 is the mean velocity , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the pressure , and @xmath5 is an order parameter related to the concentration of the fluids ( e.g. the concentration difference or the concentration of one component ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 is the viscosity of the mixture , @xmath7 is a ( small ) parameter , which is related to the `` thickness '' of the interfacial region , @xmath8 is a homogeneous free energy density and @xmath9 is the chemical potential .",
    "capillary forces due to surface tension are modeled by an extra contribution @xmath10 in the stress tensor leading to the term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : nsch1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we note that in the modeling diffusion of the fluid components is taken into account .",
    "therefore @xmath11 is appearing in ( [ eq : nsch3 ] ) , where @xmath12 is the mobility coefficient .",
    "one of the fundamental modelling assumptions is that the densities of both components as well as the density of the mixture @xmath1 are constant .",
    "of course , this restricts the applicability of the model to situations when density differences are negligible .",
    "gurtin et al .",
    "@xcite derived this model in the framework of rational continuum mechanics and showed that it satisfies the second law of thermodynamics in a mechanical version based on a local dissipation inequality .",
    "lowengrub and truskinovsky  @xcite derived a thermodynamically consistent extension of the model h for the case of different densities , which leads to the system : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the bulk viscosity coefficient . here",
    "the free energy has the density @xmath16 per unit volume .",
    "a simplified version of this model has been successfully used for numerical studies , cf .",
    "lee et al .",
    "in contrast , there are  to the best of the authors knowledge  no discrete schemes available which are based on the full model -",
    ". this may be due to fundamental new difficulties compared with model h - .",
    "for instance , the velocity field @xmath2 is no longer divergence free and the pressure @xmath4 enters the equation for the chemical potential .",
    "at least analytically , these difficulties could be overcome , see abels  @xcite for existence of weak solutions .",
    "mathematically the coupling of the navier - stokes - and the cahn - hilliard part - is much stronger and the linearized system is very different from the linearization of model h , cf .",
    "abels  @xcite , where strong solutions locally in time are constructed .",
    "alternative generalizations of the model h for the case of different densities were presented and discussed by boyer  @xcite and ding et al .",
    "@xcite . the model by ding et al .",
    "consists of  - , but now for a variable density @xmath17 . in order to justify this generalization",
    "they start from the mass balance equation @xmath18 for the individual fluids @xmath19 and define the mean velocity @xmath2 of the mixture as _ volume averaged velocity _",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the volume fraction of fluid @xmath22",
    ". then yields @xmath23 cf .",
    "section  [ eq : derivation ] below .",
    "in contrast to that lowengrub and truskinovsky define the mean velocity @xmath2 as _ mass averaged / barycentric velocity _",
    "@xmath24 , which yields @xmath25 the incompressibility relation of course has advantages with respect to numerical simulations  see the computations related to the model by ding et al . in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , - seems to be not consistent with thermodynamics in the case when @xmath1 is not constant .",
    "neither global nor local energy inequalities are known to hold for - in that case .",
    "the model by boyer is more complicated .",
    "but it is derived using a volume averaged mean velocity , which leads to a divergence free mean velocity field too .",
    "the further derivation of boyer differs from the one in @xcite and ours since the starting point are the equations for the conservation of linear momentum of each single fluid .",
    "also for this model neither global nor local energy inequalities seem to be known , cf . also @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to derive a thermodynamically consistent generalization of - to the case of non - matched densities based on a solenoidal velocity field @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , we will derive the system @xmath26 together with @xmath27 where the order parameter @xmath28 stands for the difference of volume fractions @xmath29 , @xmath19 . ] . here",
    "the free energy of the system has the density @xmath30 ( per unit volume ) . in comparison with the system derived in @xcite there is the additional term @xmath31 in the equation for the chemical potential .",
    "this term vanishes in the case of matched densities , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "but this term is crucial in the case of non - matched densities for consistency with thermodynamics .",
    "we note that in contrast to the model by lowengrub and truskinovsky - the usual continuity equation is not part of our system .",
    "nevertheless there is conservation of mass in our system .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath33 and in section  [ eq : derivation ] it will be shown that in fact individual masses are conserved .",
    "note that @xmath34 is the specific density of fluid @xmath19 and that @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasize that according to equation   the ( volume averaged ) velocity @xmath2 does not describe the flux of the density . in our model the flux of the density",
    "consists of the two parts : @xmath36 , describing the transport by the mean velocity , and a relative flux @xmath37 related to diffusion of the components .",
    "hence the diffusion of the components relative to the mean velocity leads to a diffusion of the mass density in the case that @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , we note that in the classical model h effects related to diffusion of the components can play an important role and can lead to ostwald ripening effects and disappearance of small droplets , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ eq : derivation ] we will derive the generalization of model h , described above in the framework of rational continuum mechanics .",
    "first we will use a local dissipation inequality and a choice of the energy flux as in @xcite to derive restrictions for the form of the stress tensor and the chemical potential , which finally leads to our model after suitable constitutive assumptions .",
    "then we briefly discuss the changes in the derivation if the energy flux is not specified at the beginning and liu s lagrange multiplier method is used , cf .",
    "@xcite . in section  [ sec : onsager ] , we present a third approach to derive a thermodynamically consistent model , this time based on onsager s variational principle .",
    "we consider the more general situation when either the system is subjected to gravitational forces or when one additional soluble species is present in both fluids . in the latter case ,",
    "transport effects across the interface are taken into account , too , and we derive a diffuse interface analogue of henry s law , cf . section [ sec : onsager ] .    in section  [ sec : sharpinterface ]",
    "we discuss the sharp interface asymptotics in the limit @xmath39 for the diffuse interface model together with a soluble species .",
    "this is done by using the method of formally matched asymptotics .",
    "we show that the limit system depends essentially on the choice and the scaling of the mobility .",
    "actually , we consider four cases related to choosing the mobility degenerate or non - degenerate and letting the mobility tend to zero or not .",
    "if the mobility @xmath40 vanishes as @xmath39 , we end up with the classical model for a two - phase flow with the young - laplace law @xmath41_-^+\\boldsymbol{\\nu}+ [ p]_-^+\\boldsymbol{\\nu } = \\sigma \\kappa \\boldsymbol{\\nu}\\qquad \\text{at}\\      \\gamma(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the interface between the fluids , @xmath43 is a unit normal to @xmath42 , @xmath44 is its mean curvature , @xmath45 is a surface tension coefficient , and @xmath46_-^+$ ] denotes the jump of a quantity at @xmath42 in the direction of @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the interface is transported by the velocity of the fluid , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the normal velocity of @xmath42 .",
    "if a soluble species with density @xmath49 is present , we obtain the classical henry condition for the jump of the concentrations of the soluble species .    in the case of a constant mobility ,",

    "we prove that energy estimates are valid for sufficiently smooth solutions of the sharp interface models .",
    "finally , several important identities for the formally matched asymptotics calculations are shown in the appendix .",
    "* acknowledgements : * the authors are grateful to hans wilhelm alt for several stimulating discussions , which helped to improve the presentation of the derivation of the model .",

    "in order to derive the diffuse interface model , one assumes a partial mixing of the macroscopically immiscible fluids in a thin interfacial region . therefore let us introduce some terminology related to mixtures . in the following",
    "the fluids are labeled by @xmath19 and they fill a domain @xmath58 .",
    "the total mass density of the mixture is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 denotes the mass density of the fluid @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath60 is the mass of the fluid @xmath22 contained in a set @xmath61 and we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath63 the _ mass concentration _ and note that @xmath64 .    denoting by @xmath65 the mass flux of fluid @xmath22 , the mass balance equation in local form",
    "is given by @xmath66 defining the velocities @xmath67 , @xmath19 , of the single fluids as @xmath68 the mass balance equation can be rewritten as @xmath69 in what follows we assume that the volume occupied by a given amount of mass of the single fluids does not change after mixing , i.e. , the excess volume due to mixing is zero .",
    "if @xmath70 is the specific ( constant ) density of the unmixed fluid @xmath22 , we introduce @xmath71 .",
    "the assumption that the excess volume is zero results in @xmath72 expressed in terms of the mass concentrations @xmath73 and @xmath74 , condition ( [ volin ] ) reads as @xmath75 introducing the mass concentration difference @xmath76 , the above relation implies that @xmath77 with a function @xmath78 defined via @xmath79 we remark that possible choices for the order parameter in the phase field model are the mass concentration difference @xmath5 , the density difference @xmath80 or the difference of volume fractions @xmath81    we now introduce a suitable averaged velocity of the mixture .",
    "in contrast to the _ mass averaged / barycentric velocity _ @xmath82 given by @xmath83 , cf .",
    "lowengrub and truskinovsky  @xcite , we choose the volume averaged velocity @xmath2 of the mixture as in boyer  @xcite and ding et al .  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we define @xmath84 cf . @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain , using the fact that the @xmath85 s are constants , @xmath86 furthermore , we denote by @xmath87 the mass flux of the fluid @xmath22 relative to the velocity @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath88 because of ( [ eq : divfree ] ) and @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 or equivalently , @xmath91 where @xmath92 . because of @xmath93 , we require @xmath94 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : divfree ] ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "in addition we have @xmath97 if @xmath98 , we have in general @xmath99",
    ". hence the classical continuity equation does not hold with respect to the velocity @xmath2 .",
    "this reflects the fact that we allow for mass diffusion in the system .    instead of @xmath5",
    ", one could use @xmath100 as order - parameter .",
    "because of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 , we can also assume that @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in order to have flexibility in the choice of the order parameter",
    ", we assume that @xmath106 and @xmath107 for some order parameter @xmath108 such that @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the density difference .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath111    as in gurtin et al .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the inertia and kinetic energy due to the motion of the fluid relative to the gross motion is negligible .",
    "therefore we consider the mixture as a single fluid with velocity @xmath2 , which satisfies the laws of conservation of linear and angular momentum of continuum mechanics with respect to the volume averaged velocity .",
    "the density and the stress tensor are assumed to depend on additional internal variables like @xmath108 and @xmath112 .",
    "i.e. , we assume that @xmath113 for a stress tensor @xmath114 , which has to be specified by constitutive assumptions . here",
    "external forces are neglected for simplicity .    because of the constraint @xmath115 , the stress tensor @xmath114 is only determined up to @xmath116 for some scalar quantity @xmath4 .",
    "hence we make the _ ansatz _ @xmath117 in order to specify the behavior of the mixture , we will make several constitutive assumptions on the form of the stress tensor @xmath114 and the relative mass flux @xmath118 in the following .",
    "finally , we assume the relative motion of the fluids to be diffusive , and we introduce a helmholtz free energy density @xmath119 ( per unit volume ) . it will play the role of an interfacial energy for the diffuse interface .",
    "the total energy in a volume @xmath120 is then obtained as the sum of the kinetic and the free energy , i.e. , @xmath121 where @xmath122 .      in the following @xmath123",
    "shall denote an arbitrary volume that is transported with the flow .    in order to describe the change of the free energy due to diffusion , we introduce a _ chemical potential _ @xmath9 and the outer unit normal @xmath124 to @xmath125 such that @xmath126 is the energy transported into @xmath127 by diffusion and @xmath128 denotes integration with respect to the surface measure .",
    "_ surface forces : _ moreover , we assume the existence of a generalized ( vectorial ) surface force @xmath129 such that @xmath130 represents the working due to microscopic stresses . above and in the following @xmath131",
    "is the material derivative @xmath132 .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath133 describes the working in a given volume @xmath127 due to the macroscopic stresses in the fluid . + _ second law of thermodynamics / local dissipation inequality : _ as in @xcite , we assume the following dissipation inequality , which is the appropriate formulation of the second law of thermodynamics in an isothermal situation : @xmath134 for every volume @xmath127 transported with the flow .",
    "this means that the change of total energy in time is bounded by the working due to macroscopic and microscopic stresses and the change of energy due to diffusion .",
    "we recall the transport theorem , see e.g. liu  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 . ) : @xmath135 where the exterior normal velocity of @xmath127 is given by @xmath136 on @xmath125 , i.e. , @xmath127 is transported with the flow described by @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the equivalent local form is @xmath137 using ( [ eq : divfree ] ) , ( [ eq : diffeq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : conservationlinmomentum ] ) , we will simplify @xmath138 .",
    "first of all , multiplying ( [ eq : conservationlinmomentum ] ) with @xmath2 and using ( [ eq : diffeq1 ] ) , one easily obtains @xmath139 since @xmath140 moreover , @xmath141 and @xmath142 because of ( [ eq : diffeq1 ] ) and where we have used @xmath143 thus we conclude that ( [ eq : localdiss ] ) is equivalent to @xmath144 where we have used @xmath115 .    in order to motivate the constitutive assumptions",
    ", we will derive some restrictions for the constitutive relations specifying @xmath145 by an argument typical for rational continuum mechanics : to this end , we assume that @xmath146 are functions of @xmath147 only .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath148 is symmetric in order to have conservation of angular momentum . invoking general external forces and mass supplies in the equations ,",
    "one argues that @xmath149 can attain arbitrary values for a given point in space and time and since @xmath150 and @xmath129 do not depend on @xmath151 , we conclude from ( [ eq : dissinequality ] ) that @xmath152 necessarily .",
    "in particular , @xmath129 depends only on @xmath153 .",
    "hence ( [ eq : dissinequality ] ) reduces to @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "since the skew part of @xmath156 can attain arbitrary values independent of @xmath157 , we conclude that @xmath158 thus @xmath159 and therefore @xmath160 for some @xmath161 .",
    "on the other hand , the first term after the equality sign in ( [ eq : dissinequality2 ] ) is linear in @xmath131 and @xmath162 and @xmath9 are assumed to be independent of @xmath131 .",
    "therefore the first term in ( [ eq : dissinequality2 ] ) has to vanish to satisfy ( [ eq : dissinequality2 ] ) in general and @xmath163 finally , the local dissipation inequality is satisfied if and only if @xmath164 here @xmath165 is also called viscous stress tensor since it corresponds to irreversible changes of the energy due to friction in the fluids .    _ constitutive assumptions : _ motivated by newton s rheological law , we assume that @xmath166 for some function @xmath167 .    finally , we choose @xmath168 in the form @xmath169 where @xmath170 , which corresponds to a generalized fick s law .",
    "we remark that @xmath171 can be chosen to be nonlinear with respect to @xmath172 as long as ( [ eq : dissinequal2 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "summing up , we derived the following diffuse interface model : @xmath173 together with @xmath174 where @xmath161 satisfies ( [ eq : rel1 ] ) . assuming the normal component of @xmath2 and the normal derivative of @xmath9 to vanish on the boundary of the fluid domain @xmath175 , @xmath176 is a constant in time . by and",
    ", we may express both mass densities as affine linear functions of @xmath177 .",
    "hence , the total mass @xmath178 , @xmath179 , of each liquid component is conserved .    if @xmath180 is the mass concentration difference , then @xmath181 , and we obtain @xmath182 together with @xmath183 here @xmath184    in the case that @xmath185 is the density difference , we have @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and therefore @xmath188 and @xmath189 finally , in the case that @xmath190 is the difference of volume fractions , we have @xmath191 and we obtain the system , together with @xmath192 where we use a rescaled flux @xmath193 , and a rescaled chemical potential @xmath194 .",
    "we hence obtain @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "usually we take the difference of volume fractions as order parameter .",
    "this has the advantage that the mass difference depends linearly on the order parameter and as usual in phase field models the values @xmath197 correspond to unmixed ",
    "pure  phases .",
    "it is also possible to exploit a dissipation inequality without introducing generalized surface forces .",
    "we now assume a dissipation inequality @xmath198 for every volume @xmath127 transported with the flow for some general _ energy flux _",
    "@xmath199 , which will be specified later .",
    "then the equivalent local form is @xmath200 because of the conservation law ( [ eq : flux ] ) , we conclude that for every scalar function @xmath201 the inequality @xmath202 has to be valid . using ( [ eq : conservationlinmomentum ] ) , ( [ eq : id1 ] ) , ( [ eq : id2 ] ) we obtain that ( [ eq : localdiss2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath203 where we have used @xmath115 . making use of ( [ eq : id3 ] ) we conclude that the latter inequality is equivalent to @xmath204 where again the equation @xmath115 was used .",
    "if we assume now that @xmath205 , and @xmath206 are independent of @xmath131 , we conclude that the first term after the equality sign in ( [ eq : dissinequalityb ] ) has to vanish for all values of @xmath131 .",
    "thus @xmath207 if we denote @xmath208 , then we obtain the same identity for the `` chemical potential '' @xmath9 as before . moreover ,",
    "if we now specify the energy flux as @xmath209 we end up with the local dissipation inequality @xmath210 which is just ( [ eq : dissinequal2 ] ) .",
    "thus we can derive the model ( [ eq : firstlt1])-([eq : firstlt4 ] ) as before by making the same constitutive assumptions .",
    "in this section , we follow a third pathway to obtain diffuse interface models in the spirit of ( [ eq : firstlt1c])-([eq : firstlt3c ] ) and in agreement with the postulations of thermodynamics .",
    "it is based on onsager s variational principle , see @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for applications in multi - phase flow . to widen the range of applications , we discuss two additional features .",
    "we allow for gravitational forces or , alternatively , we include the transport of a soluble species across fluidic interfaces as an additional effect . for simplicity , we refrain ourselves in the second case to a species that does not influence the surface tension at the interface . adopting the notation from the previous sections ,",
    "the order parameter will be denoted by @xmath108 and we take it to be the difference @xmath211 , of the volume fractions @xmath21 , @xmath19 , of the two liquids involved . hence , @xmath212 where @xmath213 and @xmath214 are the specific densities of liquid @xmath215 and @xmath216 , respectively . with @xmath49 , we denote the mass density of the soluble species which we assume to be dilute .",

    "the stress tensor @xmath220 is symmetric ( due to conservation of angular momentum ) , and @xmath221 denotes the force density .",

    "however , if the specific densities of the external forces acting on the different species are identical , then those forces do not contribute to entropy production . therefore , if no other external forces than gravity forces are applied , we may identify the rate of change of the mechanical work with @xmath250 as @xmath251 equation is satisfied if @xmath252 here , @xmath253 denotes the gravitational force . to determine the fluxes @xmath254 and",
