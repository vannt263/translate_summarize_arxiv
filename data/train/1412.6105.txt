    "galaxy clusters are fundamental probes for many questions of extra - galactic astrophysics and cosmology , both from the observational as well as from the theoretical point of view ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "their properties are relatively well known at low redshift @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it has been assessed that the central regions of massive clusters are dominated by passive early type galaxies .",
    "their stellar populations are old , having formed at @xmath2 .",
    "more debated and uncertain is the main epoch at which these stellar populations assembled into the single galactic units we see in the local universe . indeed , there seems to be some disagreement between the relatively important role of merging below @xmath3 expected on the basis of recent theoretical computations @xcite , and some observational constraints @xcite .",
    "unsurprisingly , a proper theoretical understanding of this and other questions concerning the evolution of galaxy populations in clusters requires a treatment of the various processes driving it , such as star formation , agn activity , feedback and dynamical interactions at a much deeper level than presently feasible .",
    "galaxy clusters over cosmic time are prime laboratories for these processes acting together , which results in a clear environmental dependence of the basic properties of galaxies , and of their evolutionary history .    at @xmath4 , a regime approaching the formation epoch of massive clusters ,",
    "observational studies become more and more problematic and , as a consequence , scarce .",
    "the identification of clusters ( or proto - clusters , somewhat loosely defined as systems that exhibit a signicant over - density of galaxies , not yet gravitationally bound , but that may collapse to form a cluster at later time ) becomes difficult , due both to increasing detection challenges and intrinsic rareness . also , a detailed determination of the properties of their galaxies is progressively uncertain .    nevertheless , the study of high z clusters is now an active field of research , as testified by the fact that even the redshift barrier of z=1.5 has been broken in the last few years , by means of mid infrared or x - ray selection , albeit by just a handful of examples so far .",
    "these observations suggest that , while galaxy populations in the centers of massive clusters show little change out to @xmath5 @xcite , in higher redshifts clusters , intense star formation becomes common , even in the cores and in the most massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite , considering only the ir luminous galaxies in the core ( projected distances @xmath6 ) of a _",
    "spitzer_-selected cluster at @xmath7 , found that the star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density to be at least @xmath8 .",
    "this estimate has been later revised downward by @xcite to @xmath9 , with a contribution from the bcg of @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite measured a strikingly high amount of star formation @xmath12 1100 @xmath11  in the inner 250 kpc of a massive ( @xmath13 ) cluster at @xmath14 @xcite , using apex laboca 870 @xmath15 m observations of the field around the so - called spiderweb radio galaxy at z=2.16 , widely studied as a signpost for a massive cluster in formation , measured a sfr density of @xmath12 900 @xmath11mpc@xmath16 , occurring within a region of 2 mpc .",
    "the sfrs reported in this paragraph have been obtained assuming a relationship between the total ir luminosity and sfr .",
    "the calibration of this relationship depends on the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) , which in the original papers was salpeter in some cases @xcite and chabrier in others @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "it is a factor @xmath12 1.7 higher . for the sake of homogeneity",
    ", we have converted all the estimates to the latter imf , which is the same used in our simulations . ] on the other hand , there are also examples of high redshift clusters ( @xmath2 ) with a mixed population comprising both quiescent , structurally evolved galaxies , as well as star forming ones @xcite , or even clusters dominated by quiescent early type galaxies @xcite . in any case , there have been reports of a reversal of the sfr - density relation , showing increasing sfr with increasing local density at @xmath17 , both in the field as well as in higher density environments @xcite .    to shed light directly on the history of assembly of galaxy clusters ,",
    "it is clear that larger samples are highly demanded at high redshift , greater than @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , various samples should be selected by means of different techniques , in order to capture different evolutionary stages of clusters or proto - clusters . a widely used method to discover high redshift clusters",
    "has been to look for the effects of their hot gas component , namely its x - ray emission or the sz effect it produces on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the former type of selection becomes rapidly inefficient at @xmath19 , due to sensitivity limitations , and both require massive and well relaxed structures , whose number density is expected to be rapidly declining at such early cosmic epochs .",
    "a complementary possibility , which has been exploited in the past few years , is to preselect overdensities of galaxies whose near infrared photometric properties are characteristic of high redshift systems .",
    "these overdensities require later spectroscopic confirmation . at @xmath20",
    "most efforts have been devoted in the search of protoclusters using high - z giant radiogalaxies as tracers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a recently explored alternative to select high z clusters of galaxies has been used by @xcite , taking advantage of the well assessed efficiency of far - ir / sub - mm surveys in detecting high - z objects in a violent",
    ", dust obscured , star forming phase ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these authors , following the suggestion by @xcite , tested the idea of exploiting the all sky coverage of the planck satellite survey , in order to detect candidate clusters undergoing a pristine and violent star forming phase .",
    "these are expected to show up as cold compact sources , significantly contributing to the planck number counts , which can be later confirmed as clumps of high - z galaxies by means of higher angular resolution maps produced by the herschel satellite . in this first demonstrative study",
    ", @xcite uncovered four such sources looking just at the @xmath21 sq .",
    "deg .  of sky observed by herschel as part of the hermes survey .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to compare these findings with the predictions of our high resolution simulations of the formation of massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to do this , we post - process the simulation results at high @xmath4 with grasil-3d  @xcite , a recently developed fully three dimensional radiative transfer code , which computes the dust reprocessing of the primary photons emitted by stellar populations ( or other sources ) , and",
    "it has been developed specifically to deal with the output of simulations .",
    "this post - processing is of course required in order to properly compare with observations at ir or sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "we discuss to what extent the spectrophotometric properties of the cluster region are robust against reasonable variations of grasil-3d  assumptions , in the various spectral regions .",
    "we incorporate in grasil-3d  a consistent treatment of the radiative effect of agn activity ( our simulations include agn feedback ) , which allows us to predict its contribution to the emitted specific luminosity .    besides grasil-3d",
    "a few other tools exist with similar capabilities , and have been coupled with simulation output , e.g. : the later version of sunrise @xcite ; radishe @xcite ; art2 @xcite and skirt @xcite .",
    "all but grasil-3d , which uses ray - tracing and finite difference , use monte carlo techniques to follow the transfer of photons through the diffuse ism , and hence the dust re - emission",
    ". however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that this post - processing has been applied to galaxy clusters as a whole .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : simu ] is devoted to a brief description of the simulations set , and contains references to previous papers , wherein all the details can be retrieved ; in section [ sec : g3d ] the radiative code used to post - process the simulations , grasil-3d , is described , including a few modifications introduced specifically for the purposes of this paper ; the results are presented and discussed in section [ sec : results ] , and summarized in the final section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "for this work we used simulations of 24 lagrangian regions extracted from a low resolution n  body simulation within a cosmological box of @xmath22 comoving size .",
    "we assumed a flat @xmath23cdm cosmology with the following parameters : matter density parameter @xmath24 ; baryon density parameter @xmath25 ; hubble constant @xmath26 ; normalization of the power spectrum @xmath27 ; primordial power spectral index @xmath28 .",
    "the lagrangian regions surround the most massive halos identified at @xmath29 in the parent simulation , all having virial mass of at least @xmath30 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "initial conditions for the hydrodynamical simulations have been created by increasing mass resolution within such regions , and adding the corresponding high - frequency fourier modes from the linear power spectrum of the adopted cosmological model . in the mass of dm particles",
    "is @xmath31 , and the initial mass of each gas particle is @xmath32 .",
    "our simulations were performed using the treepm - sph gadget-3 code , an improved version of gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "the force accuracy , in the high resolution regions , is set by @xmath33 kpc for the plummer - equivalent softening parameter , fixed in comoving units at redshifts @xmath34 and fixed in physical units in the redshift range @xmath35 .",
    "when computing hydrodynamical forces , the minimum value attainable for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) smoothing length of the b - spline kernel is set to half of the gravitational softening length .",
    "the simulations used in this work include gas cooling , star formation , supernova feedback and agn feedback .",
    "we adopted a chabrier initial mass function ( imf , * ? ? ? * ) . for a detailed description of the sub - resolution models we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the former paper contains a discussion of the prescriptions for the bh feedback , which is based on the simple recipe put forward by @xcite and adopted in many simulations , woth a few important modifications . these were necessary because the latter model was thought and calibrated for non - cosmological high resolution simulations of merging galaxies .",
    "it is now well recognized that the sub - resolution prescriptions are sensitive to resolution , and as such they generally require re - calibration or even a deeper rethinking when the resolution is changed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , we found that the recipes proposed by @xcite for the bh feedback leads , in the context of our significantly lower resolution cosmological simulations , to several unwanted and misleading effects , discussed in @xcite , such as unrealistic merging of distant smbh particles or losses of the energy produced by accretion .",
    "our approach there has been to introduce the minimal changes required to avoid unreasonable results .    since some concepts of this modelling are used in section [ sec : g3d ] , to help the reader we provide here a brief summary .",
    "the bhs are represented by means of collision - less particles , subject only to gravitational forces , and growing by accretion and merging .",
    "the accretion rate is given by the minimum between a bondi accretion rate , modified by the inclusion of a multiplicative factor , and the eddington limit .",
    "the former is loosely thought of as providing an estimate of how the gas available for accretion scales with the conditions in the bhs surroundings , while the eddington limit ensures that the produced radiation pressure does not overcome gravity .",
    "when two bh particles are within the gravitational softening and their relative velocity is smaller than a fraction 0.5 of the sound velocity of the surrounding gas , we merge them .",
    "the accretion onto smbhs produces an energy determined by a parameter @xmath36 , giving the fraction of accreted mass converted to energy .",
    "another parameter @xmath37 defines the fraction of this energy that is thermally coupled to the surrounding gas . as usual , we calibrated these parameters in order to reproduce the observed scaling relations of smbh mass in spheroids at z=0 .    for the analysis presented in this paper , we identified cluster progenitors at several redshifts @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , our sample has a median virial mass of @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath41 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding median sfrs within the virial radii are of 800 and 500 @xmath11 .      as described in full details in @xcite , the 24 most massive clusters , in terms of the mass assigned by the adopted cluster identification algorithm _",
    "friend of friends _",
    "( fof ; davis et al .",
    "1985 ) , have been selected in the parent simulations at z=0 .",
    "the re - simulations at higher resolution have been carried out using the _ zoomed initial conditions _",
    "technique @xcite .",
    "the hr regions allow us to identify other 50 less massive and interesting clusters , uncontaminated by low resolution particles , which have been studied in several papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , here we focus only on the 24 originally selected ones , because they constitute a statistically well defined sample , whose final virial mass is in the range between @xmath42 1 and @xmath43 ( see table 1 in bonafede et al .",
    "our sample has a median virial mass of @xmath39 and @xmath40 at redshift 2 and 1 respectively , and the corresponding median sfrs within the virial radius are of 800 and 500 @xmath11 .",
    "in order to perform radiative transfer calculations in the region of simulated clusters , we use grasil-3d  @xcite , a recently developed fully three dimensional radiative transfer code , which computes the dust reprocessing of the primary photons emitted by stellar populations ( or other sources ) .",
    "grasil-3d , while largely based on the formalism of the widely used model grasil @xcite , has been specifically designed to be applied to systems with arbitrary geometry , in which radiative transfer through dust plays an important role , such as galaxies or interesting regions identified in the output of hydrodynamical galaxy formation codes . with respect to the already published version ,",
    "we have introduced here a few modifications to adapt it to the output of our version of gadget-3 , in particular for what concerns the radiative effect of agn activity .",
    "the main features of grasil-3d  are summarized below , while we refer the reader to @xcite for all the details .",
    "a description of the modifications introduced for the purposes of this paper follows this summary .",
    "a somewhat overlooked point is that any sensible computation of radiative transfer from the output of cosmological simulations , inevitably requires the introduction of a few more free or uncertain parameters , with respect to those already demanded by the treatment of baryon physics in the simulation itself .",
    "these are related to the sub - resolution astrophysics , in particular that concerning the molecular clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "since mcs are the sites of star formation and massive stars spend part of their lives within or close to them , it is expected and well established that in star forming systems a significant fraction of dust reprocessing occurs precisely in mcs .",
    "this fraction is an increasing function of the specific star formation activity , and of the total reprocessing itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "current cosmological hydro - dynamical simulations that follow galaxy formation are only beginning to resolve mcs ( we remind the reader that the typical sizes and masses of giant mcs are of the order of @xmath44 pc and @xmath45 m@xmath46 respectively ) , for zoom - in simulations of single galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but their high computational cost makes them un - doable as yet for simulations on cluster scales . therefore some further sub - resolution modelling is required to cope with dust reprocessing .",
    "in particular , in grasil-3d  the ism is divided into two components , the molecular clouds ( mcs ) and the diffuse _ cirrus_. in order to calculate the mass in the form of molecular clouds it is assumed that unresolved gas densities at any point of the simulated volume follow a log - normal probability distribution function ( pdf ) , the mean of the pdf is given by the local gas density and dispersion @xmath47 ( a free parameter ) , as suggested by small scale ( @xmath12 1 kpc ) simulations .",
    "then , the local contribution to the molecular fraction is given by the fraction of the pdf above a threshold density , @xmath48 .",
    "the two parameters introduced so far , which control the molecular gas fraction are , @xmath49 and @xmath47 , may reasonably range from about 0.3 to 3 m@xmath46 pc@xmath16 and from 2 to 3 respectively",
    ".    once the molecular fraction at any location of the system is calculated , grasil-3dtakes into account the age - dependent dust reprocessing of stellar populations .",
    "this age dependency arises from the fact that younger stars are associated with denser ism environments ( note that grasil was the first model to take it into account ) .",
    "this is obtained assuming that stars younger than a certain time @xmath50 ( a further parameter ) are enshrouded within molecular clouds , characterized by their mass @xmath51 and radius @xmath52 .",
    "then , the radiative transfer is treated separately in the two components with the required accuracy .",
    "we explicitly note that , even though we apparently introduced here two more parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , what actually matters for the radiative transfer computation is the ratio @xmath53 , which therefore should be regarded as the only new parameter . a detailed non - equilibrium calculation for dust grains smaller than a given radius ( @xmath54   in this work ) and for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons molecules ( pahs ) is performed .",
    "their emission is usually very important at @xmath55 m in the cirrus component .",
    "grasil-3d  has a general applicability to the outputs of either lagrangian or eulerian hydrodynamic codes .",
    "the first applications of the code have been done interfacing it with the output of the p - deva and gasoline sph codes @xcite .",
    "the main modification of grasil-3d  introduced in this work has been to account for the radiative effect of smbh particles present in the simulation , which provide the agn feedback as mentioned in section [ sec : simu ] . to do this ,",
    "we assume that the radiation emitted by the smbh particles is distributed according to a template sed , properly normalized by the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the latter is computed from the accretion rate and from the radiative efficiency , as @xmath56 .",
    "we remind the reader that the former quantity is predicted by the simulation for each smbh particle , while the efficiency @xmath57 is a parameter of the simulation .",
    "it is set to @xmath58 in the runs used in this work ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "as for the sed , we adopted in our standard computation the mean sed of sdss quasars computed by @xcite , plotted in figure [ fig : templates ] .",
    "it is observationally known and theoretically expected that agn are characterized by a substantial anisotropy of their emission , giving rise to the broad dichotomy between type 1 and type 2 agn .",
    "this is likely related to a preferential axis in their central engine ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we neglect this complication here .",
    "this is owing to two reasons .",
    "the former is that our simulations do not give any prediction for the agn preferential axis , which is possibly related to the smbh spin .",
    "the second and most reassuring one is that we checked that different choices for the assumed template sed yields only very small differences in the predicted ir properties of clusters , which become usually negligible at @xmath59 m ( see section [ subsec : eff_smbhs ] and figure [ fig : cfrt_sed_radoff ] ) .",
    "this holds true even for the totally opposite case of assigning to all smbh particles the typical sed of obscured type 2 qso , such as that reported by @xcite , also shown in figure [ fig : templates ] .",
    "we note that these observational templates include by construction the reprocessing by dust in the region close to the smbh , namely that which has been long since ascribed to a torus - like structure .",
    "the latter has been invoked to explain the observational differences between type 1 ( _ un - obscured _ ) and type 2 ( _ obscured _ ) agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is actually what we need . indeed , even though little can still be safely concluded on the detailed geometrical properties of these structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , even the more extended models do not consider torii larger than @xmath60 pc @xcite , which is far below the resolution of any cosmological simulation .",
    "we assumed that sph gas particles contain dust only when their temperature is lower than a certain threshold , that in the present work we set to @xmath61 kelvin .",
    "however , the results are very weakly dependent on this value . for instance",
    ", we verified that the predicted seds of clusters are almost indistinguishable if the threshold is increased or decreased by a factor @xmath62 .",
    "the maximum difference occurs at around the peak of dust emission @xmath63 m and in the far uv , and is @xmath64 % .",
    "the dust to gas ratio @xmath65 of gas particles colder than the threshold temperature was assumed to be proportional to their metallicity , with a proportionality constant calibrated to get the standard galactic value @xmath66 at solar metallicity , i.e.  we set @xmath67 .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that about 50% of metals are locked in dust grains .",

    "figures [ fig : maps_z1 ] and [ fig : maps_z2 ] show examples of such images , in several interesting band - passes , for one of the clusters at redshift 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "the physical size of each panel is 2000 kpc , which at these redshift is close to the planck hfi beams @xmath68 arcmin , and is larger than the virial diameter of the clusters at both redshifts , typically by a factor @xmath69 and 5 respectively .",
    "no telescope effects ( like point spread functions , pixel sizes , etc . ) have been taken into account . in this section",
    ", we will show how the predicted seds arising from the same region depend on grasil-3d  parameters and other assumptions , and then we will discuss some implications for star forming cluster searches at sub - mm wavelengths .      to summarize",
    ", the parameters introduced by the radiative transfer calculations performed with grasil-3d  are ( i ) the timescale for newly born stars to get rid of the parent mc , @xmath50 ; ( ii ) the ratio between the mass of mcs and the square of their radius @xmath70 , which in conjunction with the dust to gas ratio @xmath65 determines the optical depth of the mc , @xmath71 ; we remind you that @xmath65 is set by the local gas metallicity , see end of section [ sec : g3d ] ; ( iii ) the threshold density for gas to be in the mc dense phase @xmath72 and ( iv ) the dispersion @xmath47 of the sub - resolution pdf of gas densities .",

    "m they may amount to a factor @xmath69 .",

    "we retain the same dust mixtures for the mcs and for the cirrus as in @xcite , which have been calibrated to reproduce the average properties of local galaxies . as for computing dust emission ,",
    "the most delicate region is that below @xmath76 m , where the contribution from small thermally fluctuating grains and pahs becomes important , and relatively minor variations just in the adopted size distribution of grains may produce large variations .",
    "this kind of uncertainty is expected to increase with redshift , and considering environments very different from those in which our knowledge of dust optical properties has been derived . at longer wavelengths , where the bulk of ir power is normally emitted , and is dominated by grains big enough to be in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field , the predictions are much more robust . here",

    "usually , in the spectral ranges between 0.1 to 1 @xmath15 m and 15 to 100 @xmath15 m rest frame , we found that the agn activity boosts the integrated flux by a fraction ranging from @xmath90 to @xmath91 at z=2 .",

    "however , in the far uv at @xmath92 m and in the near ir at @xmath93 its contribution becomes more significant . in the former regime",

    "this is far too low even for the typical sensitivity @xmath117 jy of the final planck catalogues of compact sources @xcite . it may be worth pointing out that @xcite , exploiting the simple semi - analytic model ( sam ) by @xcite for the co - evolution of spheroids and qso , which provided a good match to the sub - mm number counts available at that time , estimated , for an instrument with the resolution of planck / hfi , surface densities of 850 @xmath15 m sources in good keeping with the findings by @xcite",
    "furthermore , from the observational point of view , these finding seems to be strengthened by a more recent combined analysis of much larger portions of the sky observed by planck and herschel @xcite . in this case , hundreds of over - densities of high - z galaxies have been identified , which may be interpreted as proto - clusters characterized by typical global sfr of the order of several thousands @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_sfr ] highlights that our sample of simulated cluster regions is characterized by a strong correlation between the instantaneous virial mass and the sfr , computed within a box matching the planck - hfi beam , both at z=1 and 2 .",
    "we find a similar well defined correlation between the sfr at any interesting z and the _ final _ virial mass , on which the selection of the sample is based ( section [ sec : clusel ] ) . as a consequence , it seems very unlikely that , extending our study to lower mass clusters , we could find systems featuring high z sf activity as intense as that hinted by the recent observations and never attained by our objects .    in figure",
    "[ fig : map_z2_convol ] we show the predicted z=2 images in the herschel - spire 350 @xmath15 m band for two cluster regions .",

    ", it would be very difficult , if not impossible , to uncover and study structures similar to those predicted by our simulations with present day fir and sub - mm space facilities .",
    "as we mentioned before , we have also simulation runs with agn feedback switched off . in this case the predicted sfrs , and correspondingly the expected fluxes in the herschel bands , are typically higher by a factor @xmath119 and 1.5 at redshift 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "these numbers would be in better agreement with the figures quoted by @xcite , albeit still too low at @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , it is well known that without some treatment of this astrophysical process , cosmological simulations over - predict the amount of baryons converted into stars , particularly in massive systems , by about one order of magnitude ( see for instance * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "one possibility to increase the predicted fluxes would be to adopt a more top heavy imf .",
    "however , in order to get an increase by a factor of a few , as required in particular by the finding of @xcite , the imf should be quite extreme , similar to the flat imf postulated by the durham sam ( during bursts ) to reproduce the sub - mm number counts @xcite .",
    "we have verified that in this case the sfr would be only slightly modified , because two competing effects almost cancel each other : more gas recycling and faster chemical enrichment on one side , and stronger snae feedback on the other side . in the deepest developing potential wells yielding to the formation of the most massive clusters , we found , according to our prescriptions , some prevalence of the former effect , causing an increase of sfr by no more than 10 - 20 % .",
    "however , adopting such an extreme imf , the predicted flux for a given sfr at @xmath120 m rest frame can increase by a factor of a few , the exact value depending on the star formation history .",
    "there are some hints of imfs more top heavy than chabrier in violently star - forming environments ( but also for the opposite ) , but nothing approaching such an extreme imf has ever been observed . moreover , later studies have shown that this quite ad hoc assumption leads to a few remarkable problems in the context of the durham sam ( for a discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "it seems therefore unlikely that the difficulty highlighted in this section can be entirely solved by the adoption of a different imf in our simulations .",
    "in this work we have post - processed a sample of cosmological zoom - in simulations following the formation of the 24 most massive galaxy clusters selected from a parent simulation of box size of @xmath22 .",
    "the final virial mass of the clusters ranges from @xmath42 1 to @xmath121 .",
    "the post processing consists of performing radiative transfer computations with the grasil-3d  code @xcite including dust reprocessing , in order to predict the ir properties of the forming clusters during the most active star forming phases .",
    "we have implemented in grasil-3d  a treatment of the radiative contribution due to agn activity , consistent with the prescriptions adopted in the simulation for the agn feedback .",
    "the latter is widely recognized as a key ingredient to limit the overproduction of stars in massive halos .",
    "the expected contribution to the ir emission from accretion power could be significant at @xmath122 m , but minor or negligible at @xmath123 m .",
    "however , going to shorter and shorter wavelengths , the exact budget becomes progressively dependent on the adopted grasil-3d  assumptions .",
    "we have demonstrated that during the early phases of assembly of massive galaxy clusters our simulations do not reach far ir luminosities high enough , by a factor at least of a few , to account for the reported discovery of four high z , massively star forming clusters by @xcite , over an area of about 90 sq .",
    "degrees in the planck satellite survey .",
    "since we have shown that this conclusion is very robust with respect to any reasonable variation of the assumptions required to perform the dust emission computations and that the possible contribution to the overall emission from agn is small in this spectral regime , the problem directly translates to _ insufficient peaks _ of star formation activity in the simulations at early epochs .",
    "this problem becomes more puzzling taking into account that the same simulations _ over - predict _ the final stellar mass in bcgs hosted by massive clusters at z=0 , by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "high - redshift star formation rates can be increased in numerical simulations .",
    "improving the resolution would already boost the sfr to some extent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but still not enough to eliminate the tension between observations and the models . also , it would be possible to re - calibrate the sub - grid prescriptions for the baryon physics .",
    "however , it appears very difficult to enhance the sfr at high redshifts without also increasing the final mass of simulated bcgs , thus worsening the above mentioned disagreement .",
    "indeed there have been already reports of a paucity of strong starburts in recent cosmological simulations , once their sub resolution physics is calibrated to reproduce other constraints ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these violent star formation events would be required to explain the statistical properties of the general population of sub - mm selected galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "we wish to address this issue in the near future , by applying the grasil-3dpost processing described in this paper to a forthcoming hydrodynamical simulation of an entire ( rather than just zooms of the massive cluster regions ) cosmological box , including sub - resolution physics .",
    "this would provide new clues on the ongoing debate on the use of smgs to trace the assembly of massive structures at high - z ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , recent observations suggest a picture according to which the @xmath124 population of galaxy ( proto)clusters contains examples with both extreme ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as very low star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in our simulated clusters these two opposite situations are clearly under - represented .",
    "it seems that the bulk of star formation in the progenitors of real massive galaxy clusters occurred at higher rates , but lasted less than in our simulations .    these opposite tensions may indicate that the prescriptions adopted to describe the sub - resolution processes should be improved to better capture the relevant physics . possibly ,",
    "if the situation hinted by the growing data set on ( proto)clusters at @xmath4 is confirmed , the interplay between the feedback schemes and the star formation model should yield overdense regions characterized by both higher and lower star formation levels than attained in current simulations , while avoiding an overproduction of stars over the assembly history of the most massive cluster galaxies .",
    "it is conceivable that an early phase of positive feedback during the development of agn activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or a longer delay between the most violent episodes of star formation and the onset of efficient agn quenching ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be part of a more realistic modeling .",
    "finally , we notice that since our prescriptions for the baryonic sub - grid physics , apart minor variations , are quite standard in present day cosmological simulations , we expect that our findings would apply to most of them in the same halo mass regime .",
