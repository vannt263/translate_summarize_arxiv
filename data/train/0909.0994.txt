    "in general , systems in the universality class of the two - dimensional 4-state potts model display critical singularities that are modified by logarithmic correction factors . a satisfactory explanation of this fact is provided by the renormalization scenario due to nienhuis et al .",
    "it explains the logarithmic factors @xcite as arising from the second temperature field , which is marginally irrelevant .",
    "it also shows that the 4-state potts behavior without logarithmic factors can only occur at special points in the parameter space , where the two leading temperature fields simultaneously vanish .",
    "the exactly solved baxter - wu model @xcite precisely fits such a location in parameter space : it belongs to the 4-state potts class and its leading critical singularities do not have logarithmic factors .",
    "its reduced hamiltonian reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the inverse temperature , and the sum is over the up- and down triangles of the triangular lattice , and the site labels @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the three spins at the vertices of each triangle .",
    "each spin assumes the ising values @xmath6 ; this is emphasized by the superscript i of the coupling @xmath7 . at low temperatures ,",
    "the model is in one of four long - range ordered phases , where most triangles have an even number of @xmath8 spins . while the common type of interaction between spins in magnetic materials is of the two - spin type , three - particle interactions such as in the baxter - wu model",
    "have been used to describe the shape of face - centered cubic crystal surfaces @xcite .",
    "this work investigates two different generalizations of the baxter - wu model .",
    "first we consider the case that the couplings in the up- and down triangles are different ( see fig .  [ triangle ] ) , i.e. , @xmath9 where the sums are over the up- and down triangles of the triangular lattice respectively .",
    "the introduction of another temperature - like parameter makes it likely that this model will have a critical line parametrized by the ratio of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the fourfold degeneracy of the ground state persists for @xmath12 , so that it may seem plausible that the model still belongs to the 4-state potts universality class .",
    "we shall attempt to provide a more definite judgment by means of a numerical investigation .",
    "triangular lattice .",
    "the lattice is divided into a honeycomb ( open and filled circles ) and a triangular sublattice ( pentagons ) , which are dual to each other .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is bipartite . ]    for the second generalization it is useful to write eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) in terms of two - state potts variables @xmath13 or 2 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 if @xmath16 is odd and 1 if @xmath16 is even , and @xmath17 .",
    "the sum is over all up- and down triangles .",
    "( [ bw ] ) and ( [ bw2 ] ) differ by an additive constant that is irrelevant for the present purposes .",
    "it is now straightforward to generalize the model in terms of @xmath0-state variables with values @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "this model can also be considered as a generalization of the @xmath0-state potts model @xcite to 3-spin interactions , because the pair couplings of the original potts model on a bipartite lattice can be written as @xmath23 .",
    "but the model ( [ bwq ] ) does not obey the @xmath0-fold permutation symmetry @xmath24 of the potts model for general @xmath0 .",
    "its symmetry group is @xmath25 where the @xmath0-state clock symmetries @xmath26 are generated by the operation @xmath27 , independently for two of the three sublattices , @xmath28 is generated by the operation @xmath29 on all sites , and @xmath30 is the symmetric group of the permutations of the three sublattices . the latter symmetry results from the spatial symmetries of the lattice , namely reflection and translation or rotation , which can permute the three sublattices , while leaving @xmath31 invariant .",
    "it is obvious that the degeneracy of the ground state increases as @xmath32 with the number @xmath0 of spin states , so that one may expect that the model will display a discontinuous ordering transition for @xmath33 .",
    "the special nature of the critical baxter - wu model , i.e. the model of eq .",
    "( [ bwq ] ) for @xmath34 , namely the vanishing of the marginal temperature field , opens the possibility of another scenario .",
    "after a mapping on the coulomb gas @xcite , the marginal temperature field translates into the fugacity of the @xmath35 electric charges .",
    "thus the @xmath34 transition maps precisely on the point of the gaussian fixed line where the electric charges are absent , and there seems to be a real possibility that this is also the case for other values of @xmath0 . since one expects that the coulomb gas coupling increases with @xmath0 , the electric charges , which are marginal at @xmath34 , must be relevant for @xmath33 , and would drive the ordering transition first order .",
    "but , if these charges remain absent , the transition still takes place on the gaussian line , and must be critical .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to investigate the character of the ordering transition for @xmath33 .",
    "there are existing results due to alcaraz et al .",

    "they concluded that the transition is first - order for @xmath37 , on the basis of approximate renormalization calculations , and monte carlo calculations starting in the ordered and the disordered states , displaying changes of phase .",

    "are dual to multisite interactions @xcite , the parameter @xmath196 may as well be interpreted as a scaling field depending on the type of interactions . at @xmath176 ,",
    "the field @xmath196 becomes marginal @xcite at the critical point .",
    "we reproduce this flow diagram @xcite , adapted to our purposes , in fig .",
    "the @xmath176 potts model is located at a value of @xmath196 smaller than that at the @xmath176 fixed point , and is still attracted by it , although marginally .",
    "this explains the slow finite - size convergence , and the logarithmic factors of the @xmath176 potts model .",
    "the baxter - wu model is located at the @xmath176 fixed point .",
    "the introduction of a difference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , such that the condition of self - duality is still satisfied , allows for the possibility that the location of the model in fig .",
    "[ prg ] changes .",
    "the coordinate @xmath0 will remain unchanged , but _ a priori _ there does not seem to be a way to tell whether the model will move up or down in the diagram , or perhaps will keep its location .",
    "but , since the finite - size estimates of @xmath111 and @xmath118 for the @xmath197 models and those for the @xmath176 potts model lie on opposite sides with respect to the baxter - wu model , we may locate the @xmath197 models at a value of @xmath196 exceeding that of the baxter - wu model , as indicated by `` 2c '' in fig .",
    "therefore they flow to the discontinuity fixed point @xcite located at large @xmath196 , so that the phase transition is discontinuous . in view of the symmetry between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the marginally relevant field @xmath196 can , in lowest order , not depend linearly on @xmath198 near the 4-state potts fixed point , and one expects a contribution as @xmath199 .",
    "this is consistent with the very weak dependence of the finite - size data in table [ tab_1 ] on small differences @xmath200 .     and the fugacity @xmath196 of vacancies , according to ref .",
    "the curve represents a line of fixed points .",
    "its lower branch is attractive and describes the critical random - cluster model .",
    "the upper branch of fixed points is repulsive and describes the tricritical random - cluster model .",
    "when @xmath196 exceeds its tricritical value , the renormalization flow leads to a discontinuity fixed point , corresponding with a first - order transition . the position of the baxter - wu model ( bw ) , of the @xmath176 potts model ( 4p ) and the presently investigated self - dual @xmath34 models with @xmath194 ( 2c ) are sketched",
    "]    thus we conclude that the generalized baxter - wu model with different couplings described by the hamiltonian ( [ bw2c ] ) undergoes a phase transition at the self - dual line for @xmath201 , and that the phase transition is first order for @xmath159 , although extremely weakly so when the difference @xmath198 is small . even for a rather large difference @xmath202 ,",
    "we find ( see fig .",
    "[ q2hys ] ) a very narrow hysteresis loop .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath38 and 4 the transition is also discontinuous .",
    "this result disproves the possibility mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] that the @xmath33 self - dual generalized baxter - wu models renormalize to a coulomb gas in which the fugacity of the electric charges vanishes , in which case algebraic critical behavior would occur .",
    "apparently the fugacity is nonzero , and , since the electric charges are relevant for @xmath33 , the models renormalize away from the gaussian line to a discontinuity fixed point .",
    "the first - order character of the @xmath176 model , as expressed , for instance , by the energy discontinuity , is stronger than that of the @xmath38 model .",
    "we expect the first - order character to grow even stronger with a further increase of @xmath0 and/or the introduction of an asymmetry @xmath159 .",
