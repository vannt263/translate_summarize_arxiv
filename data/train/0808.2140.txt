    ", the geometric microbridge josephson junction labeled 1 can be in the @xmath1 , @xmath64 or @xmath2 state depending on its width and on the temperature whereas the josephson junction labeled 2 always is in the normal or @xmath1 state@xcite . ]    from the phase diagrams , we conclude that the structure sizes required for the experimental realization of the @xmath2 and in particular of the @xmath64 state in cuprate high - temperature superconductor microbridges are within reach of modern fabrication technology .",
    "because of the larger coherence length , electron - doped materials are especially promising  @xcite .",
    "to test our predictions we suggest an interference experiment with a dc superconducting quantum interference device ( dc squid ) consisting of two microbridge jjs with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : squid_d6 ] ) .",
    "geometry- and temperature - dependent intrinsic phase differences according to the phase diagram will show up as shifts of the corresponding flux - dependent interference pattern .",
    "the experimental verification of the intrinsic phase differences would at the same time imply a direct confirmation of the anomalous counterflowing quasiparticle surface currents which are a unique and intriguing fingerprint of @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry .",
