    "in the last decade , a new understanding of integrability of discrete systems as their multi - dimensional consistency has been a major breakthrough @xcite , @xcite . this led to classification of discrete 2-dimensional integrable systems ( abs list ) @xcite , which turned out to be rather influential . according to the concept of multi - dimensional consistency ,",
    "integrable two - dimensional systems can be imposed in a consistent way on all two - dimensional sublattices of a lattice @xmath7 of arbitrary dimension .",
    "this means that the resulting multi - dimensional system possesses solutions whose restrictions to any two - dimensional sublattice are generic solutions of the corresponding two - dimensional system .",
    "to put this idea differently , one can impose the two - dimensional equations on any quad - surface in @xmath7 ( i.e. , a surface composed of elementary squares ) , and transfer solutions from one such surface to another one , if they are related by a sequence of local moves , each one involving one three - dimensional cube , like the moves shown of fig .",
    "[ fig : local moves ] .",
    "a further fundamental conceptual development was initiated by lobb and nijhoff @xcite and further generalized in various directions in @xcite .",
    "this develpoment deals with variational ( lagrangian ) formulation of discrete multi - dimensionally consistent systems .",
    "its main idea can be summarized as follows : solutions of integrable systems deliver critical points simultaneously for actions along all possible manifolds of the corresponding dimension in multi - time ; the lagrangian form is closed on solutions .",
    "this idea is , doubtless , rather inventive ( not to say exotic ) in the framework of the classical calculus of variations .",
    "however , it has significant precursors .",
    "these are :    * theory of pluriharmonic functions and , more generally , of pluriharmonic maps @xcite . by definition , a pluriharmonic function of several complex variables @xmath8 minimizes the dirichlet functional @xmath9 along any holomorphic curve in its domain @xmath10 .",
    "differential equations governing pluriharmonic functions ( and maps ) are heavily overdetermined .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that they belong to the theory of integrable systems .",
    "* baxter s z - invariance of solvable models of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this concept is based on invariance of the partition function of solvable models under elementary local transformations of the underlying planar graph .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that one can associate the planar graphs underling these models with quad - surfaces in @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the classical mechanical analogue of the partition function is the action functional .",
    "this makes the relation of z - invariance to the concept of closedness of the lagrangian 2-form rather natural , at least at the heuristic level .",
    "moreover , this relation has been made mathematically precise for a number of models , through the quasiclassical limit , in the work of bazhanov , mangazeev , and sergeev @xcite . *",
    "the classical notion of variational symmetries , going back to the seminal work of e.  noether @xcite , turns out to be directly related to the idea of the closedness of the lagrangian form in the multi - time .",
    "this was further elucidated in @xcite .",
    "especially the relation with the pluriharmonic functions motivates a novel term we have introduced to describe the situation we are interested in , namely : given a @xmath0-form @xmath11 in the @xmath2-dimensional space ( @xmath12 ) , depending on a function @xmath4 of @xmath2 variables , one looks for functions @xmath4 which deliver critical points to actions @xmath13 corresponding to any @xmath0-dimensional manifold @xmath6 .",
    "we call this a _ pluri - lagrangian problem _ and claim that integrability of variational systems should be understood as the existence of the pluri - lagrangian structure .",
    "we envisage that this notion will play a very important role in the future development of the theory of integrable systems .",
    "a general theory of one - dimensional pluri - lagrangian systems has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that for @xmath14 the pluri - lagrangian property is characteristic for commutativity of hamiltonian flows in the continuous time case and of symplectic maps in the discrete time case .",
    "this property yields that the exterior derivative of the multi - time lagrangian 1-form is constant , @xmath15 .",
    "vanishing of this constant ( i.e. , closedness of the lagrangian 1-form ) was shown to be related to integrability in the following , more strict , sense :    * in the continuous time case , @xmath16 is equivalent for the hamiltonians of the commuting flows to be in involution , * in the discrete time case , for one - parameter families of commuting symplectic maps , @xmath16 is equivalent to the _ spectrality property _",
    "@xcite , which says that the derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the parameter of the family is a generating function of common integrals of motion for the whole family .",
    "a general theory of discrete two - dimensional pluri - lagrangian systems has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the main building blocks of the multi - time euler - lagrange equations for a discrete pluri - lagrangian problem with @xmath17 were identified .",
    "these are the so called 3d - corner equations .",
    "the notion of consistency of the system of 3d - corner equations was discussed , and this system was analyzed for a special class of three - point 2-forms , corresponding to integrable quad - equations of the abs list . on this way ,",
    "a conceptual gap of the work by lobb and nijhoff was closed by showing that the corresponding 2-forms are closed not only on solutions of ( non - variational ) quad - equations , but also on general solutions of the corresponding multi - time euler - lagrange equations .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the case of quadratic lagrangian 2-forms , leading to linear 3d - corner equations .",
    "the following notations are used throughout the paper .",
    "the independent discrete variables on the lattice @xmath18 are denoted @xmath19 .",
    "the lattice shifts are denoted by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-th coordinate vector .",

    "we will assume that @xmath11 depends on some field assigned to the points of @xmath7 , that is , on some @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath31 depends on the values of @xmath4 at the four vertices of @xmath26 : @xmath32 * to an arbitrary oriented quad - surface @xmath6 in @xmath7 , there corresponds the _ action functional _ , which assigns to @xmath33 , i.e. , to the fields at the vertices of the surface @xmath6 , the number @xmath34 * we say that the field @xmath35 is a critical point of @xmath36 , if at any interior point @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 equations ( [ eq : del gen ] ) are called _ discrete euler - lagrange equations _ for the action @xmath36 ( or just for the surface @xmath6 , if it is clear which 2-form @xmath11 we are speaking about ) . *",

    "[ def : plurilagr system ] * ( system of corner equations ) * a 3d - corner is a quad - surface consisting of three elementary squares adjacent to a vertex of valence 3 .",

    "if the action for the surface of an oriented elementary cube @xmath40 of the coordinate directions @xmath41 ( which can be identified with the discrete exterior derivative @xmath42 evaluated at @xmath40 ) is denoted by ( @xmath43 is the shift in the @xmath44-th coordinate direction ) @xmath45 then the system of corner equations consists of the eight equations @xmath46 for each triple @xmath41 .",
    "symbolically , this can be put as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 stands for the `` vertical '' differential ( differential with respect to the dependent field variables @xmath4 ) .    *",
    "( corner equations : maps and correspondences ) * each of eight corner equations ( [ eq : corner eqs ] ) relates seven fields and may be not uniquely solvable with respect to them , i.e. generically define correspondences .",
    "this leads to a substantial complication of analysis of consistency of the system discussed in the rest of this section ( non - connectedness of the variety of solutions ) .",
    "we do not refer to these problems here and assume that the variety of solutions is connected ( or one can single out a `` physical '' connected component ) . in the case of linear pluri - lagrangian systems considered in the present paper",
    "all corner equations are linear and these problems do not appear .    as demonstrated in @xcite , the flower of any interior vertex of an oriented quad - surface in @xmath7 can be represented as a sum of ( oriented ) 3d - corners in @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the system of corner equations encompasses all possible discrete euler - lagrange equations for all possible quad - surfaces .",
    "in other words , solutions of a pluri - lagrangian problem as introduced in definition [ def : plurilagr problem ] are precisely solutions of the corresponding system of corner equations .",

    "the system of corner equations ( [ eq : corner eqs ] ) for one elementary cube is heavily overdetermined .",
    "it consists of eight equations , each one connecting seven fields out of eight .",

    "the main feature of this definition is that the `` almost closedness '' of the 2-form @xmath11 on solutions of the system of corner equations is , so to say , built - in from the outset .",
    "one should compare the proof of the following theorem with similar proofs in @xcite .",

    "it is defined by the formulas analogous to ( [ dconjugate ] ) : @xmath93    existence of discrete pluriharmonic functions is a condition on the weights @xmath86 .",
    "it can be locally reformulated as a condition on a 3d cube .",
    "complex weights @xmath94 correspond to a consistent discrete laplace operator if and only if they satisfy the star - triangle equation @xmath95    this follows from the consistency of discrete cauchy - riemann ( called also discrete moutard ) equations ( see @xcite ) .",
