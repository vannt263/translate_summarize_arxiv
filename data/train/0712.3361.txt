    "recently the dynamic properties of quasi - one - dimensional quantum spin systems have become an intense area of research . on the one hand ,",
    "a variety of quasi - one - dimensional materials were discovered during last decades . on the other hand , many exactly solvable statistical mechanics models refer to one spatial dimension . very often these models permit to make a detailed analysis not only of their thermodynamic properties but also of their dynamic properties .",
    "such theoretical investigations are necessary for interpretation of the experimental data observable in the scattering or resonance experiments on quasi - one - dimensional compounds @xcite .",
    "in this paper we analyze the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on the dynamic properties of quantum spin chains .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is present in many low - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "such antisymmetric exchange interaction , @xmath6 $ ] , takes place , if allowed by crystal symmetry , due to spin - orbit coupling @xcite and is weaker than the symmetric heisenberg superexchange interaction @xmath7 . in spite of this , this interaction has a number of important consequences and may cause a number of unconventional phenomena .",
    "interestingly , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction may appear while analyzing the nonequilibrium steady states of quantum spin chains with currents @xcite .",
    "it may also appear in the quantum spin representation in the stochastic kinetics of adsorption - desorption processes @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on the dynamic quantities of quantum spin chains was reported in several papers @xcite .",
    "in particular in refs .",
    "@xcite such analysis was performed using the symmetry arguments and field - theoretical methods for the isotropic heisenberg ( @xmath8 ) chain .    in our study",
    "we restrict ourselves to a simpler model , i.e. anisotropic @xmath1 chain , the dynamic properties of which are amenable to detailed analytical and numerical analysis .",
    "we should also note that cs@xmath9cocl@xmath10 provides a new example of spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 chain @xcite that may renew interest in the calculation of observable quantities for such a chain @xcite .    to be specific , we consider @xmath11 spins one - half governed by the following hamiltonian @xmath12 here @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the anisotropic @xmath1 exchange interaction constants",
    ", @xmath15 is the @xmath2-component of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and @xmath16 is the transverse magnetic field .",
    "such model was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite . some of its dynamic properties were examined in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , the transverse dynamic susceptibility @xmath17 of the model ( [ 1.01 ] ) was derived explicitly for @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the case of isotropic @xmath1 interaction @xmath20 ( in this case the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction can be eliminated from the hamiltonian by a spin axes rotation ) was analyzed in some detail @xcite .",
    "the performed analysis is based on the jordan - wigner transformation , @xmath21 which transforms ( [ 1.01 ] ) into the following bilinear fermi form @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in our calculations",
    "we consider both periodic and open boundary conditions .",
    "of course , in the thermodynamic limit the results for bulk characteristics should be insensitive to the boundary conditions implied . in the former case ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath25 , the bilinear fermi form ( [ 1.03 ] ) is periodic or antiperiodic depending on whether the number of fermions is odd or even .",
    "after the fourier transformation , @xmath26 ( here @xmath27 takes @xmath11 values @xmath28 for periodic boundary conditions or @xmath29 for antiperiodic boundary conditions ; @xmath30 for @xmath11 even and @xmath31 for @xmath11 odd ) , and the bogolyubov transformation with fermi - operators @xmath32 @xmath33 with @xmath34 the hamiltonian ( [ 1.03 ] ) becomes @xmath35 @xmath36 it should be noted here that only the energy spectrum @xmath37 ( [ 1.08 ] ) but not the coefficients of the bogolyubov transformation @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( [ 1.06 ] ) depends on @xmath15 . using ( [ 1.08 ] )",
    "one immediately finds that the energy spectrum is gapless when @xmath40 and @xmath41 or when @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in our numerical calculations we use open boundary conditions @xcite",
    "the bilinear fermi form ( [ 1.03 ] ) with open boundary conditions can be brought into the form ( [ 1.07 ] ) after a linear transformation @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "we are not aware of a general analytical solution for this problem .",
    "for the two particular cases , namely , the anisotropic @xmath1 chain without field and the ising chain in a transverse field such solutions can be found e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our study",
    "we solve eqs .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) numerically for chains of about a few hundred sites .",
    "the relation between the spin model ( [ 1.01 ] ) and the noninteracting jordan - wigner fermions ( [ 1.07 ] ) is a key step in the statistical mechanics calculations for one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 systems .    in our study of the dynamic properties we focus on the dynamic spin structure factors",
    "@xmath48 the dynamic structure factors are of considerable importance since they are directly comparable with inelastic neutron scattering experiments of some quasi - one - dimensional substances . the dynamic transverse spin structure factor @xmath49 can be easily evaluated analytically ( section 2 ) .",
    "the transverse dynamics is governed exclusively by a two - fermion excitation continuum the properties of which in the case of @xmath1 chain without the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction were discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "another quantity which is also governed by the two - fermion excitation continuum is the dynamic dimer structure factor @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction on the two - fermion excitation continuum deserves a separate discussion ( section 3 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dynamic structure factors are computed numerically ( section 4 ) . we compare and contrast the properties of different dynamic structure factors at different values of the transverse field and temperature emphasizing the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "we end up with conclusions ( section 5 ) .",
    "some preliminary results of this study were announced in the conference paper @xcite .",
    "we start with the @xmath3 dynamic structure factor of the model ( [ 1.01 ] ) . for analytical calculation of this quantity",
    "one can consider only periodic ( or only antiperiodic ) boundary conditions for the bilinear fermi form ( [ 1.03 ] ) .",
    "using the relation between spin and fermi operators ( [ 1.02 ] ) and the transformations ( [ 1.04 ] ) and ( [ 1.05 ] ) , ( [ 1.06 ] ) after standard calculations using the wick - bloch - de dominicis theorem we arrive at @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fermi function .",
    "this result agrees with the corresponding formula for the transverse dynamic susceptibility @xmath17 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .    introducing the function @xmath52 the dynamic structure factor @xmath49 ( [ 2.01 ] ) can be expressed as follows @xmath53 in the limit of isotropic @xmath1 interaction @xmath54 eq .",
    "( [ 2.03 ] ) yields the result obtained earlier @xcite . in the limit @xmath55 ( when @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) eq . (",
    "[ 2.03 ] ) becomes @xmath59 this coincides with the expression obtained earlier in ref .",
    "we notice that eq .",
    "( [ 2.04 ] ) is more generally valid for the case @xmath42 ( when @xmath60 ) and @xmath57 . in the case @xmath61 and @xmath57 or in the most general case of arbitrary @xmath15 and @xmath62 ( as well as in the case @xmath55 but @xmath62 which was not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the @xmath3 dynamic structure factor exhibits new qualitative features in comparison with the analysis reported in ref .",
    "again the @xmath3 dynamic structure factor is governed exclusively by two - fermion excitations as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 2.03 ] ) , however , for @xmath61 , @xmath57 or for @xmath62 all three @xmath63-functions in eq . ( [ 2.03 ] ) may come into play .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the gray - scale plots for @xmath49 at low temperature ( @xmath64 ) for several typical sets of parameters ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) . for @xmath42 ( right column in fig .",
    "1 ) at such a low temperature only one two - fermion excitation continuum is relevant ( the one which arises owing to @xmath69 in ( [ 2.03 ] ) ) whereas in the opposite case @xmath61 ( left column in fig .",
    "1 ) all three two - fermion excitation continua contribute to transverse dynamics . in fig .",
    "2 we demonstrate typical low - temperature frequency profiles of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 for a chain with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath73 and different values of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xmath67 . in fig .",

    "all these data are used herein to discuss generic properties of a two - fermion dynamic structure factor ( section 3 ) and to compare different dynamic structure factors ( section 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 dynamic structure factor ( [ 2.03 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath76 with @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 in accordance with ( [ 3.01 ] ) we distinguish three two - fermion excitation continua ( they correspond to @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ 3.01 ] ) ) which govern @xmath49 .",
    "the gray - scale plots of @xmath81 , @xmath80 for a typical set of parameters , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath75 , @xmath73 , @xmath82 , are shown in fig .",
    "4 . as can be seen from ( [ 3.01 ] ) and ( [ 3.02 ] ) , ( [ 3.03 ] ) , ( [ 3.04 ] ) the specific features of the considered two - fermion dynamic structure factor which describes the dynamics of the transverse spin fluctuations are controlled by the @xmath83-functions . therefore , in fig .",
    "5 we also plot @xmath81 ( [ 3.01 ] ) for the same set of parameters as in fig .",
    "4 , although , with @xmath84 . by comparing figs . 4 and 5 one can distinguish the specific features ( coming from the @xmath83-functions ( [ 3.02 ] ) ) and the generic features ( coming from the @xmath85-functions ( [ 3.03 ] ) and the @xmath86-functions ( [ 3.04 ] ) ) of the dynamic quantity considered ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we remark that although we were not able to find a simple analytical form of the most important lines in the @xmath27@xmath87 plane characterizing the two - fermion excitation continua for a general case of the spin chain ( [ 1.01 ] ) it is easy to determine these functions numerically for any set of parameters using maple or / and fortran codes .",
    "we also recall that in the simplest case of the isotropic @xmath1 model in a transverse field ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) the corresponding results have been derived analytically @xcite .",
    "however , in the case @xmath88 , @xmath55 the analytical results have been reported only in the limiting cases @xmath89 or @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "of course , the case @xmath88 , @xmath91 considered in the present paper is even more complicated . in what follows",
    "we take a typical set of parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath75 , @xmath73 .",

    "the bounding lines of the regions in which equation ( [ 3.05 ] ) has solutions constitute the upper ( @xmath100 ) and the lower ( @xmath101 ) boundaries of the two - fermion excitation continuum , respectively ; moreover , for some regions of the wave - vector @xmath27 the lower boundaries @xmath102 may be equal to zero . alternatively , we may find the upper and the lower boundaries of the two - fermion excitation continuum seeking for the maximal and minimal values of @xmath103 while @xmath104 varies from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 we have found that @xmath100 and @xmath108 occur for the values of @xmath104 , @xmath95 , which satisfy the equation @xmath109 moreover , eq . ( [ 3.07 ] ) also holds along the boundary @xmath110 between the gray and the dark - gray regions in the upper ( @xmath97 ) and the middle ( @xmath98 ) panels in the left column in fig .",

    "further , we have found that for almost all cases @xmath115 for the values of @xmath104 which satisfy ( [ 3.05 ] ) with @xmath116 that obviously implies a familiar square - root divergence @xmath117 when @xmath87 approaches @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",

    "in particular , in fig . 7a one can see the square - root divergencies ( [ 3.09 ] ) , whereas in fig .",
    "7b aside from the square - root divergences ( [ 3.09 ] ) ( solid and dotted curves ) one can also see the dependence ( [ 3.10 ] ) ( dashed curve ) .",
    "we notice that the @xmath128 singularity remains for other values of @xmath15 and is also present when @xmath129 . for @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath55 , @xmath73 it occurs at @xmath130 while @xmath87 approaches @xmath131 .",
    "interestingly , this fact could not be detected in the earlier study on the @xmath3 dynamics in the anisotropic @xmath1 chain in a transverse field without the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xcite since that study refers to the zero - temperature case when only the continuum @xmath97 manifests itself in the transverse spin dynamics ( see discussion after eq .",
    "( [ 2.04 ] ) ) .",
    "we also notice that the observation of the @xmath128 singularity may be difficult because of the fact that this peculiarity takes place only at one specific value of @xmath27 ( in contrast to the @xmath132 singularity ) .",
    "however , for the values of wave - vector in the vicinity of this specific value one easily distinguishes a reminiscence of the @xmath128 singularity ( see the dotted curve in fig .",
    "finally we note that for some of the lines characterizing the two - fermion excitation continua we can give simple analytical expressions .",
    "thus , for @xmath97 the maximum / minimum of @xmath103 occurs at @xmath133 and @xmath134 and hence the corresponding boundary lines are given by @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "the two - fermion excitations which exclusively govern the @xmath3 dynamic structure factor , form three excitation continua and all of them manifest themselves even at zero temperature for sufficiently large strength of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "the two - fermion dynamic quantities have nonzero values in a restricted region of the @xmath27@xmath87 plane ; they may exhibit van hove singularities ( not only with exponent @xmath0 but also with @xmath162 ) ; moreover , they may exhibit finite jumps at zero temperature .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dynamic structure factors involve many - fermion excitations .",
    "however , the two - fermion excitations dominate their low - temperature behavior : at low temperatures these quantities show several washed - out excitation branches which correspond to specific lines of the two - fermion excitation continua .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction clearly manifests itself in the frequency / wave - vector profiles which makes it possible to determine the magnitude of this interaction by measuring the dynamic structure factors .",
    "dynamical structure factors can be measured by neutron scattering .",
    "another experimental technique which yields dynamic quantities is electron spin resonance ( esr ) .",
    "if a static magnetic field along @xmath2 axis and the electromagnetic wave polarized in @xmath205 direction are applied to the spin-@xmath0 anisotropic @xmath1 chain with the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , the experimentally measurable absorption intensity is given by @xmath206 thus , the theoretical results for the dynamic structure factors presented in section 4 are directly related to the esr absorption intensity @xmath207 ( [ 5.01 ] ) .",
    "similar study for the spin-@xmath0 isotropic @xmath1 chain has been recently reported in ref .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction effect on esr experiments on the materials , which can be modeled by the spin-@xmath0 anisotropic @xmath1 chain , seems to be an interesting issue .",
    "the work in this direction is in progress .",
