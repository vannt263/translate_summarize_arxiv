    "wide field , spectroscopic imaging of molecular line emission provides a vast amount of information of the gas dynamics of interstellar clouds .",
    "to exploit this information , heyer & schloerb ( 1997 ; hs97 ) introduced the application of principal component analysis ( pca ) to the position - position - velocity data cubes as a tool to investigate the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds .",
    "brunt & heyer ( 2002(a ) ; bh02 ) more rigorously defined hs97 s method for quantifying the scale - dependence of turbulent velocity fluctuations in molecular clouds , and hs97 s pca formulation has since undergone a number of extensions and refinements ( brunt 2003(a ) ; brunt et al 2003 ; heyer et al 2008 ; roman - duval et al 2011 ) .",
    "the hs97/bh02 pca formulation is ideally - suited to analysis of low signal - to - noise data and for this reason has been most commonly applied to wide - field survey data ( brunt & heyer 2002(b ) ; heyer & brunt 2004 ; roman - duval et al 2011 ; heyer & brunt 2012 ) .",
    "a significant limitation of the hs97/bh02 method to derive the power law index of the velocity structure function is its reliance on an empirical calibration that establishes the relationship between the index determined from pca and the true index of the models generated by numerical representations and computational simulations of turbulent clouds ( brunt & heyer 2002a ; brunt et al 2003 ; roman - duval et al 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , the data analysis has lacked a firm theoretical underpinning upon which other statistical methods are based ( scalo 1984 ; kleiner & dickman 1985 ; miesch & bally 1994 ; stutzki et al 1998 ; lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present an analytic formulation of the pca method that validates these previous empirical calibrations .",
    "this is a challenging task as it requires analytical representations of a complex physical process ( turbulence ) as measured by a complex analysis method ( pca ) . to simplify the problem ,",
    "the formulation relies on a central assumption that the spectral line profiles in a spectral line imaging observation of a molecular cloud can be represented as an ensemble of gaussians of fixed dispersion , with turbulent spatial correlations .",
    "the formulation predicts covariance matrices , eigenvectors , eigenvalues , and eigenimage structure and enables insight into the mechanics of the pca method that explains several empirically observed features noted in the literature ( brunt et al 2003 ; roman - duval et al 2011 ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "2 we provide a brief summary of the hs97 formulation .",
    "in section  3 we derive covariance matrices expected from an ensemble of gaussian line profiles with variable centroids .",
    "sections  4 ,  5 ,  and  6 , respectively describe the derivation of the resultant eigenvectors , eigenvalues , and eigenimages . in section  7",
    ", we present an analytic derivation of bh02 s calibration of the pca method for the turbulent velocity fluctuation spectrum .",
    "a summary is given in section  8 .",
    "in this section , we review the hs97 formulation of pca applied to spectral line imaging observations , and summarise the key empirical findings that an analytic formulation should aim to explain .      a spectroscopic imaging observation is comprised of an ensemble of @xmath0 spectra each with @xmath1 spectroscopic channels .",
    "we write the data cube as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the spatial coordinate of the @xmath4 spectrum .    in the formulation of hs97 , the spectrum , or line profile , at each spatial grid point",
    "is taken to be the raw measurable quantity that will be subjected to pca . from the ensemble of line profiles ,",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath5 is calculated as @xmath6    a set of eigenvectors , @xmath7  =  @xmath8 , and eigenvalues , @xmath9 , are determined from the solution of the eigenvalue equation for the covariance matrix , @xmath10 the eigenvalue , @xmath9 , equals the amount of variance projected onto its corresponding eigenvector , @xmath7 .",
    "the eigenimages , @xmath11 , are constructed from the projected values of the data , @xmath12 , onto the eigenvectors , @xmath7 , @xmath13 we refer to the coupled eigenvector and eigenimage at order @xmath14 as the @xmath15 principal component ( pc ) . in the most basic interpretation ,",
    "the set of eigenvectors describe the velocity magnitude of line profile differences with the ppv volume , as these generate varying levels of variance .",
    "such differences arise from gas motions such as infall , outflow , rotation , turbulent velocity fluctuations , and of course , random noise of the observation .",
    "the eigenimages show where these profile differences occur within the projected position - position plane .",
    "in their foundational work , hs97 suggested that , at each order @xmath14 , the coupled eigenvector ( as a velocity function ) and eigenimage ( as a spatial function ) could be used to study the scale - dependence of velocity fluctuations in molecular clouds .",
    "specifically , defining @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the characteristic widths of the eigenvector and eigenimage autocorrelation functions ( acfs ) respectively , hs97 found power - law relations ( @xmath18 ) for a sample of molecular clouds subjected to pca .",
    "s proposed method @xmath16 was scrutinised by bh02 , who included accounting for noise and finite resolution , and fixed @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the @xmath19 points of the eigenvector and eigenimage acfs respectively .",
    "bh02 also investigated the method s ability to recover intrinsic 3-dimensional statistical information about the velocity field and established the first calibration of the method : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spectral slope of the angular integral of the velocity power spectrum in 3d ( in this representation , a kolmogorov spectrum has @xmath22 and a shock - dominated spectrum has @xmath23 ) .",
    "roman - duval et al ( 2011 ) confirmed the bh02 calibration and examined in detail the sensitivity of the calibration to density fluctuations , using lognormal density pdfs , concluding that the calibration was stable below a critical level of ( very high ) density variability ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "brunt et al ( 2003(a ) ) and roman - duval et al ( 2011 ) showed that the method is sensitive to first - order velocity fluctuations , rather than root - mean - square velocity fluctuations .",
    "our analysis begins with a basic investigation of the covariance matrices that result from an ensemble of gaussian line profiles of fixed dispersion . we initially examine the case of a single component per line of sight , and then consider the more complex case of multiple gaussians",
    "this analysis forms the basis of later derivations in the subsequent sections .",
    "we first consider the covariance matrix that would be derived from an ensemble of gaussian line profiles .",
    "let all line profiles have the same dispersion , @xmath25 , and let the distribution of centroid velocities be drawn from a gaussian distribution of dispersion @xmath26 around a global mean velocity of zero .",
    "the total velocity dispersion of this ensemble is @xmath27 .",
    "note that here , the subscript @xmath28 refers generically to `` broadening '' of the line profile due to macroscopic turbulent fluctuations along the line of sight , and not just to the ( typically much narrower ) thermal broadening .",
    "the use of a single dispersion @xmath25 to represent this is a simplification , as not all lines of sight will produce exactly the same broadening , though observationally linewidths do not vary significantly across a cloud .",
    "the terms representing the @xmath4 spectrum , @xmath12 and @xmath29 , in the covariance matrix equation are written : @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the peak temperature , @xmath33 is the centroid velocity and @xmath25 is the velocity dispersion of the @xmath4 line profile .",
    "for the above model , the covariance matrix equation is : @xmath34 where the summation is over the total number of line profiles , @xmath0 . for large enough @xmath0 we can convert the normalised summation over @xmath35 to integrals over the probability distributions of peak temperature , @xmath36 , and centroid velocity , @xmath37 , to write : @xmath38 where we have assumed that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are uncorrelated , with independent probability distributions , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . assuming a gaussian probability distribution for @xmath37 , with dispersion @xmath26 , the integrals are easily solved to yield : @xmath41 where : @xmath42    equation  ( [ eq : sjkeq ] ) is valid for ensembles where the peak temperature of the lines can vary with position , provided the peak temperatures are uncorrelated with the centroid velocities .",
    "note that the contribution of a line profile to @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath43 . for consistency",
    ", this requires that @xmath26 be defined by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the integrated intensity of the @xmath4 line profile in the above model .",
    "ideally , equation  ( [ eq : eq7 ] ) would include a probability distribution of @xmath25 , but the simplification of a constant @xmath25 was necessary to make the integration tractable .    to visualise equation  ( [ eq : sjkeq ] ) we constructed covariance matrices according for varying @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "( these matrices agree with numerical realizations . )",

    "each row ( column ) is linearly independent .",
    "we compute the dispersion of @xmath49 along the diagonal , @xmath50 , using : @xmath51 obtained by setting @xmath52 in equation  ( 4 ) , and noting that the distance along the diagonal is @xmath53 , to find : @xmath54 similarly , we compute the dispersion of @xmath49 perpendicular to the diagonal , @xmath55 , using : @xmath56 obtained by setting @xmath57 in equation  ( 4 ) , and noting that the distance along the perpendicular is @xmath53 , to find : @xmath58 more generally , defining : @xmath59 @xmath60 it is straightforward to show that : @xmath61 i.e. that the covariance matrix is an elliptical gaussian , with dispersions @xmath50 and @xmath55 parallel and perpendicular to the diagonal respectively .    by fitting an elliptical gaussian to the covariance matrix , @xmath50 and @xmath55 can be measured , and we can deduce the line centroid dispersion , @xmath26 , and profile dispersion , @xmath25 , via : @xmath62 @xmath63 it is worth noting also that the total velocity dispersion , @xmath64 , is given by : @xmath65      we now consider a more elaborate model in which the @xmath4 spectrum is represented by the summation of @xmath66 spectral lines , each of dispersion @xmath67 , where we take @xmath66 to be moderately large . let the centroid velocities of each of these components be drawn from a gaussian probability distribution of dispersion @xmath68 centred on @xmath33 . here",
    "we envision the individual narrow lines to have approximately thermal linewidths ( dispersion @xmath67 ) that collectively generate a broadened line profile ( with dispersion @xmath25 ) due to macroscopic velocity differences along the line of sight . in the limit of large @xmath66",

    ", the line profiles could appear asymmetric and/or multiply - peaked , but many profiles averaged together would appear gaussian .",

    "the contribution of the cross - terms ( @xmath73 ) are more difficult to deal with , but we note that their contribution should recover the form of equation  ( [ eq : sjkeq ] ) in the limit of large @xmath66 . therefore we write the approximate form of the covariance matrix in the multiple component case as : @xmath74 where we expect @xmath75 as @xmath76 .",
    "this covariance matrix form contains an additional ( small ) contribution from resolvable fine structure in the line profiles , with dispersion along the diagonal of @xmath77 and dispersion perpendicular to the diagonal of @xmath67 .",

    ", we estimate that the effective @xmath14-dependence of @xmath17 is better represented by : @xmath200 i.e. an increase of the exponent , by a factor of 1.1 ( @xmath2010.03 ) , describing the reduction of characteristic spatial scale as the order increases .    combining equation  ( [ eq : dlscalesfixed ] ) with the @xmath14-dependence of the characteristic velocity scales ( equation  ( [ eq : dvscales ] ) ) , we arrive at a calibration of the pca @xmath173 exponent to the centroid velocity scaling exponent , @xmath186 , via : @xmath202 so that : @xmath203 and taking the representative value @xmath132 , as discussed in section  4.2 , this leads to : @xmath204    it remains to relate @xmath186 to the spectral index , @xmath21 , of the 3d velocity field .",

    "as explained in brunt & mac low ( 2004 ; and references therein ) , the following relation holds for uniform density and optically - thin conditions : @xmath205 some discussion of this equation is warranted , as the scaling exponent of the velocity field in 3d ( @xmath206 , here assumed independent of @xmath1 , appropriate for the non - intermittent fbm fields used by bh02 ) is given by : @xmath207 and therefore : @xmath208 the increase in the exponent upon projection ( by @xmath209 ) is known as `` projection smoothing '' , and can be qualitatively understood by considering that large - scale velocity fluctuations suffer proportionally less line - of - sight averaging than small - scale fluctuations .    using equations  ( [ gammacbeta ] )  and  ( [ eq : dvlcal2 ] ) we arrive at the analytic calibration of the pca @xmath173 exponent :",
    "@xmath210 this relation is close to , though slightly steeper than , the empirically - determined @xmath211 ( bh02 ; roman - duval et al 2011 ) .",
    "this is encouraging analytic support for the empirical calibration , and the small difference in exponent ( 0.36@xmath2010.04 versus 0.33@xmath2010.04 ) is not too concerning , given the approximations used in the derivations above .    in the above",
    ", we have not explicitly included the effects of opacity , and it is worth considering how this may affect the result .",
    "previously , it has been found empirically that opacity / saturation does not have a drastic affect on @xmath173 ( brunt et al 2003 ; roman - duval et al 2011 ) .",
    "it is also observed that application of the method to @xmath109co and @xmath212co data on the same cloud yields very similar @xmath213 spectra and similar values of @xmath173 ( e.g. brunt 2003(b ) ; brunt & mac low 2004 ; brunt et al 2009 ) .",
    "a likely reason for this insensitivity is that the centroid velocity field is not strongly affected by saturation _ if _ the saturation is symmetric about line centre .",
    "brunt & mac low ( 2004 ) demonstrate directly that the centroid fields derived in their observations from @xmath109co and @xmath212co are almost indistinguishable statistically",
    ". a secondary effect of saturation may be to move the line profiles to a flat - topped appearance , invalidating the gaussian form assumed above .",
    "however , the requirement of orthogonality in the eigenvectors essentially ensures a polynomial sequence similar to the derived hermite polynomials , so any deviations from our scaling result will likely be small .",
    "however , we can not analytically assess this at present , and must rely on the empirical / observational results .",
    "finally , we comment on two other aspects of the pca method for which a better understanding is now available in light of the above analysis .",
    "first , brunt et al ( 2003 ) found that pca appears to operate at first order ",
    "i.e. in the case of an intermittent field when @xmath214 , the pca exponent @xmath173 is better - correlated with the first - order index @xmath215 .",
    "this can be now understood to be related to the `` phase - rolling '' effect ( i.e. the @xmath14-dependent amplification of velocity fluctuations to roll the ( co)sinusoid phase of the eigenimage structure ) discussed above , which is a first order effect rather than a root - mean - square effect .",
    "second , it has been shown empirically that the recovered pca exponent @xmath173 is not strongly affected by ( column ) density fluctuations ( bh02 , roman - duval et al 2011 ) . while a full analysis of this effect is beyond the scope of the current paper , a preliminary understanding of why this is",
    "can be arrived at by considering the eigenimage structure given by equation  ( [ i2approx ] ) .",
    "an eigenimage of order @xmath14 is the product of the column density ( @xmath14-independent ) and the ( co)sinusoid ( @xmath14-dependent ) .",
    "the acf of such an eigenimage is the fourier transform of its power spectrum , which in turn is the square of its fourier transform . a product in direct - space transforms to a convolution in fourier space ,",
    "so the quantity of interest ( the fourier transform of the ( co)sinusoid ) is convolved with the fourier transform of the column density  a function that is independent of order @xmath14 . in the case of uniform column density , this function is a delta function and the transform of the ( co)sinusoid is unchanged . as column density fluctuations become more important , a broadening of the column density transform is induced , but as long as this remains narrow ( in fourier space ) relative to the ( co)sinusoid transform s fourier - space width , no significant effect on the combined power spectrum ( and therefore acf ) will be induced .",
    "however , for an extremely variable column density field with a broad fourier space extent ( as examined by roman - duval et al 2011 ) this must eventually break down .",
    "roman - duval et al 2010 determine that a density field with a lognormal pdf with @xmath216 is required for this to occur ( see their figure  5 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have derived and discussed analytic expressions for covariance matrices , eigenvectors , eigenvalues and eigenimages expected from principal component analysis of molecular cloud emission lines , in the limit where these can be represented by a collection of gaussian line profiles with turbulent spatial correlations .",
    "previous to this study , the pca method was based almost entirely on empirical analysis and lacked a firm theoretical basis .",
    "we have derived an analytic calibration of the pca method for measuring the spectrum of turbulent velocity fluctuations , which agrees reasonably well with previous empirical calibrations . however ,",
    "given the level of approximation in the analysis , we see the analytic calibration more as a validation of the empirical calibration , rather than a replacement .",
    "we have also gained significant insight into the mechanisms by which pca operates , allowing us to explain more esoteric aspects of the method , such as its preferential operation at first order and its general robustness against ( column ) density fluctuations .",
