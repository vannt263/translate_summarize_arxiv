    "the inner structure of dark matter haloes represents one of the most important constraint on cosmological and galaxy formation models . within the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm ,",
    "earlier works ignoring the effects of gas dissipation and star formation processes , have suggested that dark matter haloes have spherically - averaged density profiles that can be well fitted by simple analytical function such as the nfw profile ( navarro et al . 1996a ; navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) in which the inner slope tends to -1 or could even be as steep as -1.5 ( e.g. moore et al . 1998",
    "; jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "later numerical works favour the einasto profile with a finite central density though this profile is still cuspy and close to the nfw one ( merritt et al .",
    "2006 ; stadel et al . 2009 ; navarro et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the prediction of a peaked inner density profile seems to be seriously challenged by observations . in particular , dwarfs and low surface - brightness galaxies suggest a much shallower profile with a relatively flat slope ( @xmath7 with @xmath8 ) ( palunas & williams 2000 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; de blok et al .",

    "2011 ; walker & pearrubia 2011 ) . on the other extreme of the halo mass scale , galaxy clusters tend to have a central cusp , as evidenced by studies combining strong and weak lensing ( e.g. , limousin et al . 2007 ; leonard et al . 2007 ; umetsu et al .",
    "2007 ) , but shallower slopes than the nfw one can also be found within the inner @xmath9 kpc ( sand et al .",

    "note that a recent study found a cusp slope over @xmath10 kpc of @xmath11 , again from combined weak and strong lensing analysis of the complete clash cluster sample ( zitrin et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "this so - called `` cusp - core problem '' could imply that the cdm paradigm needs to be revised to account for dark matter self - interaction ( yoshida et al .",

    "alternatively , it could simply mean that baryonic processes play a key role in shaping the inner parts of halos and galaxies .",
    "indeed , several astrophysical solutions have been proposed to reconcile observations with theoretical predictions .",
    "stellar feedback could produce rapid variations of the gravitational potential through substantial gas mass outflows from the central region .",
    "this would flatten the inner density profile of the dark matter halo ( navarro et al .",

    "on the other hand , dark matter can also be gravitationally `` heated '' by baryons through dynamical friction caused either by self - gravitating gas clouds orbiting near the center of the galaxy ( el - zant et al .",

    "2012 , 2013 ) have argued that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback plays a similar role to that of stellar feedback in smaller systems : it can heat / expel large amounts of gas from the central regions of galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "a fraction of this gas then cools and returns to the centre , generating repeated cycles of significant inflows / outflows which in turn cause rapid fluctuations of the gravitational potential , steepening / flattening out the inner dark matter halo and galaxy stellar density profiles .",
    "such a mechanism is commonly invoked to explain the substantial body of observational evidence that the majority of massive elliptical or cd galaxies exhibit very shallow slopes in their inner ( @xmath12 kpc ) stellar surface brightness profiles ( kormendy 1999 ; quillen , bower & stritzinger 2000 ; laine et al .",

    "2009 ; graham 2013 ) .",
    "a related phenomenon is the formation of cores within the central 100 pc of massive ellipticals .",
    "these are believed to be formed dynamically , by the scouring effect of possibly stalled supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binaries at @xmath13 pc separation ( see for instance faber et al .",
    "1997 ; thomas et al .",
    "2014 and references therein ) .",
    "larger cores are also found , for more widely separated smbh pairs , of up to @xmath14 pc extent ( e.g. mazzalay et al . 2016 and references therein ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we aim to extend previous theoretical work on the role played by agn feedback , using a statistically representative sample spanning a comprehensive range of dark matter halo and galaxies masses and looking at the evolution of their inner density profiles throughout a considerable fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "this sample is extracted from our state - of - the - art hydrodynamical cosmological simulation ( dubois et al .",
    "2014 ) which includes gas cooling , star formation , stellar and agn feedback , and that we compare with two other simulations ( no agn feedback ) and ( no baryons ) stripped down in terms of modelled physical processes but featuring identical initial consitions .",
    "these simulations have been used to highlight the role of agn feedback ( volonteri et al .",
    "2016 ) in regulating the baryon content of massive galaxies ( kaviraj et al . 2016 ; beckmann et al 2016 ) and their morphological transformations ( welker et al . 2015 ; dubois et al . 2016 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly summarises the numerical modelling upon which this work is based ( simulations and post - processing ) .",
    "section 3 and 4 present our main results concerning the evolution of the inner density profiles of massive dark matter haloes and galaxies respectively .",
    "finally , we put forward and discuss our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this paper , we analyse and compare two large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , ( h@xmath0 ) , ( h@xmath1 ) and one dark matter only cosmological simulation ( h@xmath15 . is already described in dubois et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , so we only summarise here its main features .",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath16cdm cosmology with total matter density @xmath17 , dark energy density @xmath18 , amplitude of the matter power spectrum @xmath19 , baryon density @xmath20 , hubble constant h@xmath21 , and @xmath22 compatible with the wmap-7 .",
    "the size of the simulated volume is @xmath23 on a side , and it contains @xmath24 dark matter ( dm ) particles , which results in a dm mass resolution of @xmath25 . the simulation is run with the ramses code ( teyssier 2002 ) , and the initially uniform grid is adaptively refined down to @xmath26 proper kpc at all times .",
    "refinement is triggered in a quasi - lagrangian manner : if the number of dm particles becomes greater than 8 , or the total baryonic mass reaches 8 times the initial dm mass resolution in a cell .",
    "gas can radiatively cool down to @xmath27 through h and he collisions with a contribution from metals using rates tabulated by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "heating from a uniform uv background takes place after redshift @xmath28 following haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "the star formation process is modelled using a schmidt law : @xmath29 for gas number density above @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the star formation rate density , @xmath32 the constant star formation efficiency , and @xmath33 the local free - fall time of the gas .",
    "the stellar mass resolution is @xmath34 .",
    "feedback from stellar winds , supernovae type ia and type ii are also taken into account for mass , energy and metal release ( kimm , 2012 ) .",
    "black hole ( bh ) formation is also included , and bhs accrete gas at a bondi - capped - at - eddington rate and coalesce when they form a tight enough binary .",
    "they also release energy in a quasar ( heating ) or radio ( kinetic jet ) mode when the accretion rate is above ( below ) one per cent of eddington , with efficiencies tuned to match the bh - galaxy scaling relations ( see dubois et al .",
    "2012 for detail ) .",
    "the presence of both quasar and radio modes is supported by recent observations . in particular , using manga data ( bundy et al . 2015 ) , cheung et al .",
    "( 2016 ) report the presence of bi - symmetric emission features in the centre of quiescent galaxies of mass around @xmath35 from which they infer the presence of centrally driven winds . on top of the fact that such `` red geysers '' galaxies seem to be very common at this mass scale ( bundy et al .",
    ", in prep ) , the energy released by their smbhs is capable of driving the observed winds and displays a mechanical content sufficient to suppress star formation .",
    "it is therefore very likely that such kinetic winds ( radio mode ) play a crucial role in galaxy formation and should be taken into account in numerical models ( see for instance , weinberger et al .",
    "2016 ) .    and",
    "were performed using the same set of initial conditions and sub - grid modelling of physical processes but with no bh formation ( and therefore no agn feedback ) and baryons respectively .",
    "dark matter haloes are identified using the ( sub)halo finder ( aubert et al .",
    "2004 , tweed et al . 2009 ) . in our different catalogues , host haloes and subhaloes are studied separately .",
    "since we are particularly interested in studying the very inner part of dark matter haloes , a robust definition of their centre is critical . in general , the position of the most bound particle yields an accurate estimate , especially in the case of and as haloes in these simulations have cuspy inner profiles .",
    "however , as far as is concerned , as we will see in the remainder of this paper , the dark matter profiles of haloes hosting large galaxies can be flatter .",
    "therefore , for some ( rare ) object in this latter simulation , the centre can be associated with a substructure which is offset from the `` real '' centre of mass and could lead to the attribution of a spurious core . to circumvent this issue",
    ", we use a shrinking sphere approach ( power et al .",
    "2003 ) whereby starting from the virial radius , we recursively identify the centre of mass within spheres 10% smaller in linear size at each iteration .",
    "we stop the procedure once the sphere reaches a 2 kpc radius and identify the centre of the halo with its densest particle .",
    "twenty neighbours are used to compute the local density . only structures with an average density larger than 200 times",
    "the average matter density and containing more than 100 particles become part of the ( sub)halo catalogue .",
    "galaxies are also identified with but applied to star particles . in this case",
    ", we use the most bound particle as the definition of the centre of mass and only galaxies with more than 50 star particles are part of the final catalogue .",
    "finally , we build the merger trees of all the dark matter haloes and galaxies for each simulation , using ( tweed et al .",
    "2009 ) to link 52 outputs equally spaced in time between @xmath36 and @xmath6 , i.e. with a time resolution of @xmath37 250 myr .",
    "these procedures yield , for the run at redshift zero , about @xmath38 haloes and subhaloes with a mass greater than @xmath39 and @xmath40 galaxies with a mass greater than @xmath41 .      since we start from the same initial conditions , each dark matter particle possesses an identity which is identical in any of the 3 simulations .",
    "thus , if 75% or more of the particles of any given halo in the run also belong to a halo identified in the or runs , we initially assume that these haloes are twins .",
    "however , if the mass ratio of the matching pair is greater than 10 ( or lower than 0.1 ) , we exclude it from our comparison sample .",
    "this last step is rendered necessary because sub - structures can get their particles stripped by the host halo at different times and with different intensities in the three simulations . as a result ,",
    "a subhalo could become twinned with a much more massive host halo if its equivalent subhalo in the other simulation has already been destroyed ( or has become too small to be detected ) .",
    "in general , we are able to match more than 85% of dark matter objects at any redshift by applying these two criteria",
    ".    we can not implement the same procedure for galaxies since a given stellar particle is not necessarily created at the exact same moment in the very same galaxy in and .",
    "moreover , the total number of stellar particles will also differ as it depends on the impact agn feedback has on the star formation process .",
    "therefore , instead of relying upon a common identity of the stellar particles they are composed of to directly match objects between runs , we first couple each galaxy to a host dark matter halo in their parent simulation .",
    "we determine these galaxy - halo pairs by picking the most massive galaxy whose centre is located within a sphere of radius equal to @xmath42 of the virial radius of its host halo .",
    "galaxy twins between runs are then determined through the matching of their host halo as previously described .    to illustrate the typical efficiency of such a procedure , at @xmath6 , we are able to match about @xmath43 of h@xmath0 galaxies with a mass greater @xmath39 to h@xmath1 counterparts . we have checked that relaxing the quite stringent criteria adopted in this work ( slightly ) improves the matching fraction , but since it also increases the number of false matches and does not alter any of our conclusions , we prefer to restrict ourselves to the more conservative sample defined in this section .",
    "let us first study the evolution of the inner density profiles of dark matter haloes in the three simulations .",
    "our investigation starts with the evolution of the dark matter component .",
    "the questions we want to address here are twofold : 1 ) does agn feedback noticeably modify the inner density profiles of dark matter haloes ? and 2 ) how does the difference between the inner density profiles of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 ( or h@xmath2 ) haloes evolve ? to do so , we use a systematic object - to - object comparison between the , and simulations based on the matching procedure described in the previous section .",
    "note that when calculating the density profiles of haloes in the h@xmath2 run , we rescale the mass of the dm particles by a factor @xmath44 to make it identical to the mass of dm particles in the baryonic runs .    in the following",
    ", we split our h@xmath0 dm halo sample into four different mass intervals : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which we match to their h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 counterparts . for each of these four mass bins , we then compute the mean density profiles ( binned in spherical shells equally spaced in @xmath49 ) , i.e. @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 at every redshift .",
    "this allows us to consider the evolution of density profiles at fixed halo mass .",
    "in addition , we have also considered the evolution of the density profiles of the progenitors of halos within these mass bins at @xmath6 .",
    "thanks to our large simulated volume , each sub - sample consists in general of ten objects or more in the most massive bin and thousands of objects in the least massive one .",
    "however , when this is not the case ( at high redshift for the most massive objects : see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , top panels ) , we lower the redshift until a minimum of ten haloes of that mass can be identified and an average density profile computed .    in order to study the ( relative ) evolutions of the mean inner density profiles of dark matter haloes extracted from the three different simulations , we use two estimators .",
    "the first one is the _ mass - weighted density slope within @xmath53 and @xmath54 _ introduced by dutton & treu ( 2014 ) : @xmath55 where @xmath56log@xmath57@xmath58log@xmath59 is the local logarithmic slope of the density profile @xmath60 and @xmath61 the local mass . using a discrete representation of the density profiles , we measure @xmath62 and @xmath63 for each spherical shell centered on position @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is estimated in the range @xmath66=[1.0 - 5]$ ] kpc .",
    "secondly , in order to quantitatively study the evolution of the gap between the different density profiles , we compute the quantity @xmath67 and @xmath68 defined by : @xmath69 @xmath67 and @xmath68 give an estimation of the gap between the mean profiles of h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 haloes with respect to the mean profiles of h@xmath0 haloes . in the following , @xmath67 and @xmath68 have been estimated in the range @xmath66=[1.0 - 10]$ ] kpc .",
    "note that the minimal value adopted for @xmath53 is dictated by our spatial resolution , which does not allow us to reach smaller scales .",
    "spatial resolution is also the main reason why we decide not to use a fixed fraction of the virial radius to define @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 ) : we would be restricted to selecting ( at least ) @xmath70 at high redshift because haloes are more compact and we can not probe their inner kpc . in turn , this would then translate into @xmath71kpc for galaxy cluster size haloes at @xmath6 , which somewhat contradicts our purpose to examine their inner density profile to the best of our ability . for these reasons , we adopt instead a simple fixed physical scale for @xmath53 and @xmath54 : we probe the inner 1 - 5 ( @xmath65 ) or 1 - 10 ( @xmath72 ) kpc of dm haloes for any redshift and halo mass .",
    "the different choice of value for @xmath54 used for @xmath65 and @xmath73 illustrates the fact that the results presented in this paper are robust to variations of up to a factor 2 in the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the averaged spherical density profiles @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 derived for haloes pertaining to our different mass sub - samples and at three different redshifts . at a given time",
    ", they clearly appear different from one other especially in the central region ( @xmath77 kpc ) .",
    "conversely , they seem indistinguishable at large radii , suggesting that the presence of baryons and/or agn feedback induces noticeable effects only on small scales .",
    "now , if one analyses the evolution of the mean h@xmath2 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 halo density profiles separately , clear trends can be noticed .",
    "first , as expected from numerous previous studies , the h@xmath2 density profiles are always centrally cuspy : their inner slopes are consistent with a nfw profile ( as shown in the next section ) .",
    "note also that at fixed halo mass , the h@xmath2 density profiles are more extended , less concentrated , at present times than at high redshift .",
    "this well known result is mainly due to the fact that low redshift haloes have undergone more ( major ) mergers than their high redshift analogues , and these mergers tend to diffuse material at larger radii ( see for instance klypin et al .",
    "2016 ) . as a consequence , for a fixed mass interval ,",
    "the density in the halo inner region progressively decreases as more and more mass is distributed at large radii .",
    "the h@xmath1 halo density profiles are always much steeper and have higher central values compared to those in the other simulations .",
    "for a fixed mass interval , no significant variation in profile shape as a function of redshift is observed . finally , the h@xmath0 density profiles present a more complex evolution . at high redshift ( @xmath78 )",
    "the halo density profiles of the two first mass bins ( i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) are quite steep and close to their h@xmath1 matches . at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath81 $ ] ) , they appear to have flattened and can even have lower central density values ( @xmath82 kpc ) than to their h@xmath2 counterparts . finally , at present times , the density profiles of h@xmath0 haloes steepen and approach again those of their h@xmath1 twins . in view of these results , the evolution of h@xmath0 halo density profiles therefore seems to follow three distinct phases .    this scenario is confirmed when studying the evolution of the progenitors of dark matter haloes of mass @xmath83 at @xmath6 .",
    "the variations of their density profiles are shown at the same three redshifts in fig .",
    "h@xmath0 haloes clearly present a mean density profile that is shallower at @xmath84 than at @xmath85 or @xmath6 .",
    "this strongly suggests the existence of successive phases of expansion and contraction of the mean inner dm halo density profile .",
    "note that at @xmath85 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are almost indistinguishable ( red and green dotted lines on fig [ fig2 ] ) . since the density profiles of proto - dark matter haloes ( i.e. at very high redshifts ) of the three simulations are expected to be identical ( as galaxy formation has not happened yet ) , this indicates that h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 haloes density profiles have undergone a nigh identical first phase of condensation before @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that similar trends are obtained when following the progenitors of the other halo mass sub - samples .",
    "finally , as we will see in more detail in section [ section_galaxies ] , the situation differs for the evolution of galaxy profiles , in the sense that h@xmath0 stellar density profiles remain quite shallow at low redshift .",
    "the three redshift snapshots presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] provide a useful qualitative impression of the general evolution of the mean density profiles of h@xmath2 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 haloes . in order to derive more quantitative estimates , we now look at the evolution of the mass - weighted slope of their inner density profile , @xmath86 , as defined by equation [ equ1 ] .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the evolution of @xmath86 for h@xmath0 dm haloes with a fixed mass of @xmath80 ( dotted lines ) , @xmath87 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath88 ( solid lines ) .",
    "results for their h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 counterparts are also presented in the figure .",
    "first , as far as h@xmath2 haloes are concerned , values of @xmath86 are very close to @xmath89 , consistent with nfw profile expectations , although we note that @xmath86 is slightly increasing with time by about 0.3 . as haloes become more and more extended at low redshift , the range of [ 1 - 5 ] kpc is probing a relatively `` deeper '' region in terms of fraction of the virial radius compared to that probed for haloes of the same mass at higher redshifts .",
    "second , as expected from adiabatic contraction considerations ( e.g. blumenthal et al 1986 ) , the inner density profiles of h@xmath1 are always very steep with slopes that are close to @xmath90 . in this case",
    "a slight decrease , of a similar amplitude to the increase noted for h@xmath0 haloes , is observed in the evolution of @xmath86 .",
    "finally , h@xmath0 haloes with a fixed mass of @xmath91 clearly exhibit shallower inner density slopes at z@xmath37[1.5 - 1.0 ] than at higher or lower redshift , thus confirming the more qualitative results extracted from fig .",
    "similar trends are observed for lower haloes masses ( i.e. @xmath92 ) but not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for sake of clarity .",
    "more massive haloes , with masses @xmath87 and @xmath88 , generally take more time to reach their final mass , so that our analysis of their mean density profiles can only start from redshift @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . due to the non - negligible past agn activity",
    "they have already experienced by that time , one can notice that h@xmath0 haloes of these mass sub - samples already feature profiles that are quite flat and can even have mean slopes lower than their h@xmath2 counterparts .",
    "on the contrary , at low redshift @xmath74 profiles steepen considerably , with @xmath65 reaching values well below -1 , and close to -1.5 by @xmath6 , thereby confirming the visual trends highlighted in fig .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that at any given redshift , more massive haloes tend to have flatter inner density profiles than low mass ones , which confirms that agn feedback impact increases with halo mass . to give explicit numbers , at @xmath6 , density profiles of haloes with masses @xmath88 , @xmath87 , @xmath80 and @xmath92 boast an inner slope value of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively ( the latter is not shown in fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the evolution of @xmath86 for the progenitors of dark matter haloes that have a mass of @xmath87 either at @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "focussing first on the highest redshifts ( @xmath101 ) , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 profiles are clearly much steeper than h@xmath2 ones .",
    "as previously mentioned , this is mainly due to the galaxy formation process : radiative cooling and subsequent star formation lead to a steepening of the dm density profile of dm haloes due to adiabatic contraction ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2004 ) , in agreement with previous works ( e.g. , gustafsson et al . 2006",
    "; romano - daz et al .",
    "2008 abadi et al . 2010 ; pedrosa et al . 2010 ; tissera et al . 2010 ; duffy et al .",
    "note that the mean slopes of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 halo density profiles are very close at @xmath3 suggesting that agn feedback has not had an important impact yet by this redshift .",
    "fast forwarding to @xmath102 , whilst the mean profile of h@xmath1 haloes remains very steep with a slope close to -2 , that of their h@xmath0 counterparts is progressively flattened by agn feedback , in good agreement with the results reported in peirani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and martizzi et al .",
    "finally , from @xmath102 to present times , @xmath74 becomes slightly steeper as the mean inner slope of h@xmath0 haloes progressively decreases by 0.1 .",
    "the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] explain the origin of the difference in the slope of h@xmath0 halo density profiles at fixed halo mass for intermediate and low redshifts displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : h@xmath0 haloes tend to have steeper inner profiles at low redshift because they have undergone a phase of `` cusp regeneration '' . for completeness sake , we recall that additional refinement levels are triggered at @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath103 .",
    "they induce a sudden increase in star formation and black hole accretion at these different epochs as the gas is allowed to collapse to higher densities .",
    "these abrupt changes slightly affect the evolution of @xmath86 especially in the case h@xmath1 haloes , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "hence the evolution of the inner part of @xmath74 does exhibit three successive phases which are quantitatively differentiable .",
    "a first condensation phase , from very high redshifts to @xmath3 where dissipative galaxy formation processes and consequent adiabatic contraction of dark matter haloes dominate .",
    "this stage is then followed by a flattening phase , driven by important agn activity until @xmath102 .",
    "finally , a second condensation phase or cusp regeneration occurs from @xmath104 down to @xmath6 as agn activity slowly subsides .",
    "to understand this latter phase , one can study the evolution of agn activity in the relevant dark matter halo sub - samples .",
    "indeed , an analysis of the evolution of gas mass accretion onto black holes ( bhs ) @xmath105 for progenitors of dm haloes taken from each mass sub - sample and displayed in fig . [ fig5 ] reveals that for any given halo mass sample , @xmath106 and therefore agn activity progressively decrease with time . in spite of the noticeable bumps induced by the addition of new refinement levels which artificially boost accretion ,",
    "@xmath106 is one order of magnitude lower at @xmath6 than at @xmath107 .",
    "the cusp regeneration phase measured in the evolution of @xmath86 is most probably related to the fading of agn activity at lower redshifts .",
    "as emphasised by peirani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and martizzi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the flattening of dark matter halo inner density profiles is due to a repetitive cycle of rapid gas expansions driven by agn feedback and slower contractions as gas cools and falls back , which increases the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles .",
    "if agn activity progressively dwindles , this mechanism becomes less efficient at counterbalancing dm adiabatic contraction and thus keeping the dm density profiles flat .",
    "[ fig5 ] also shows the evolution of the eddington ratio @xmath108 ( where @xmath109 is the eddington accretion rate ) for the same haloes .",
    "these results suggest that the radio mode tends to be the dominant mode below @xmath110 .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed when considering haloes of fixed mass , rather than progenitors .",
    "such a redshift dependence of the dominant mode is also in agreement with volonteri et al .",
    "( 2016 ) who have studied in detail the cosmic evolution of black holes in the simulation .",
    "these authors found that the evolution of the luminosity function ( lf ) in is consistent with the existing observational determination of the bolometric lf ( hopkins et al .",
    "2007 ; shankar et al . 2009 ; ueda et al . 2014 ) provided there exists a transition at @xmath111 between quasar and radio dominated mode ( see their fig .",
    "recall that in the simulation , the explosive quasar mode consists in an isotropic injection of thermal energy into the surrounding gas while at low accretion rates , the more quiescent radio mode deposits agn feedback energy into a bipolar outflow ( see dubois et al .",
    "2010 for a complete description ) .",
    "it is therefore not very surprising that such a transition also affects the evolution of inner dark matter halo profiles , since the radio mode of agn feedback mainly prevents hot gas from cooling and eject little gas from the galaxy ( beckmann et al . in prep ) .",
    "the cusp regeneration phase was already observed by di cintio et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and tollet al .",
    "( 2016 ) in hydrodynamical simulations focusing on lower mass haloes ( i.e. @xmath112 ) .",
    "these authors claimed that the density slope of dm haloes mainly depends on the ratio between stellar mass and total halo mass @xmath113 , with large ratios ( @xmath114 ) corresponding to contracted profiles .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the variation of the slope of dm halo density profiles , estimated this time within 1 - 2 % of the virial radius , as a function of the ratio @xmath115 for h@xmath0 haloes of mass @xmath48 and matching h@xmath1 haloes .",
    "we find that in general , our haloes have values of @xmath115 greater than @xmath116 and slopes steeper than -1 , indicative of contraction . at @xmath6 ,",
    "h@xmath0 haloes have steeper density profiles and higher @xmath115 values compared to haloes of the same mass at @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , in the absence of agn feedback , higher values of @xmath118 are obtained which are associated to steeper profiles ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath86 is strongly correlated with @xmath115 , thus corroborating the previous findings of di cintio et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and tollet al .",
    "( 2016 ) . however , it is worth mentioning that their simulations did not include agn feedback and therefore are difficult to extrapolate to high mass haloes .",
    "nonetheless , we remark that our results from h@xmath1 haloes are in fair agreement with the predictions of their fitting function for @xmath120 .      in this section",
    ", we study the evolution of @xmath67 and @xmath68 defined by equation [ equ2 ] which monitors how the relative gaps between @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 evolve .",
    "the variations of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are thus expected to provide complementary information to the evolution of the slope of dark matter halo density profiles previously studied .",
    "let us start with the relative evolution of @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the variations of @xmath67 for the haloes of our four considered mass intervals at @xmath6 ( top panel ) and their progenitors ( bottom panel ) .",
    "three successive phases can clearly be identified again , particularly when looking at the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . at very high redshift",
    ", @xmath67 tends to 0 as galaxy formation has yet to significantly affect the inner structure of dark matter haloes .",

    "this suggests again that agn activity is reducing the central density ( and the inner density slope ) of h@xmath0 haloes which results in reducing the gap w.r.t .",
    "the matching h@xmath2 haloes density profiles .",
    "finally , from @xmath122 $ ] to @xmath6 , @xmath67 decreases again , always remaining negative .",
    "the gap between the inner density profiles of h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 haloes thus progressively becomes more and more important since this time the central density ( and the inner density slope ) of h@xmath0 haloes is increasing ( phase of cusp regeneration ) .",
    "note that the second phase ( i.e. flattening of h@xmath0 dm halo density profiles ) occurs sooner and lasts longer for more massive objects .",
    "furthermore , the third phase occurs later for more massive objects .",
    "this reinforces our conclusions based on the evolution of inner profile density slopes that agn feedback impacts more durably and significantly the most massive haloes .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn when studying the time evolution of @xmath67 for haloes with a fixed mass , independent of cosmic time , as displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "@xmath67 is increasing at high redshifts ( @xmath123 ) for the first three lower mass intervals while keeping negative values .",
    "these black , green and red curves reach a maximal value at redshifts around 1.6 , 1.6 and and 1.2 respectively : agn activity has efficiently reduced the central density as well as flattened the profiles of h@xmath0 haloes , leading to the reduction of the gap between inner density profiles of h@xmath0 and matching h@xmath2 haloes .",
    "note that for these three mass intervals , @xmath67 is already negative at high redshift due to dm adiabatic contraction induced by galaxy formation having already taken place in such massive haloes . then , after each peak , @xmath67 monotonically decreases until @xmath6 ( phase of cusp regeneration ) . for the most massive haloes ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath67 is mainly decreasing but remains positive until @xmath124 indicating that h@xmath0 haloes of this mass at higher redshifts have lower central density ( and also flatter density profiles ) than their h@xmath2 counterparts .",
    "this also reinforces that agn activity has a stronger impact on the inner dm density profiles of the most massive haloes .    .",
    "agn feedback manifests itself through two effects .",
    "first , it reduces star formation rates in massive galaxies and therefore the amount of stellar material present in their central parts .",
    "second , as we have previously discussed , it flattens the dm host halo density profile , especially at intermediate redshifts . as a result",
    ", the central dark matter profiles of h@xmath0 haloes should always be less steep and have lower central values when compared with their h@xmath1 halo counterparts .",
    "in other words , @xmath68 must always be positive .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the variation of @xmath68 for both progenitors and haloes within fixed mass intervals and confirms again the trends previously pointed out . in the top panel , for the three less massive halo mass intervals , the gap between the dm halo density profiles in h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 first increases until it reaches a maximum value for @xmath125 close to 1.2 .",
    "it then slightly decreases as the redshift progresses towards @xmath6 . for the most massive halos , with masses @xmath48 ,",
    "the gap is essentially always increasing until @xmath126 after which it remains constant until @xmath6 .",
    "this is consistent with our previous result : the effect of agn feedback ( quasar mode ) is more efficient at high redshift , leading to a rapid increase of the gap between the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 dm halo profiles .",
    "then , in a longer and later phase between @xmath127 , agn activity diminishes , and the gap narrows slightly .    the bottom panel of fig .",

    "again , at very high redshift , @xmath68 is close to 0 for all considered mass intervals since agn feedback has not yet kicked in .",
    "the gap between h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 haloes then increases until @xmath128 $ ] and stays roughly constant afterwards .",
    "it is worth mentioning again that adding an extra refinement level at @xmath4 and @xmath129 causes spurious artefacts to appear in the otherwise rather smooth evolution of @xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to a sudden better force resolution and enhanced gas condensation which has a more dramatic effect in horizon - noagn than in horizon - agn , where it is somewhat compensated by a simultaneous rise in agn activity .",
    "in the following , we compare the stellar density profiles of galaxies in the same way as we previously did for the dark matter component : we use a systematic ( agn ) galaxy to ( noagn ) galaxy object - to - object comparison using our matching procedure .",
    "we also focus our analysis on four ( h@xmath0 ) galaxy stellar mass intervals : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "clear gaps between @xmath134 and @xmath135 can be seen in the central regions , and up to a radius of 50 kpc for the most massive galaxies .",
    "moreover , the gap between inner density profiles is all the more important than the galaxies are massive , and increases slightly with time .",
    "similarly to what we observe for the dark matter component , stellar density profiles with and without agn feedback are similar at large radii . however ,",
    "in contrast to what happens for dark matter haloes , h@xmath137 galaxy density profiles remain quite flat at low redshift , as already suggested by fig .",
    "such a behaviour is also more consistent with observations ( e.g. kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "note that , at a given mass , galaxies are in general more extended at low redshifts because they experience more mergers that tend to spread material at large radii , which increase their effective radius over time ( khochfar & silk 2006 ; bournaud , jog & combes 2007 ; naab , johansson & ostriker 2009 ; peirani et al 2010 ; oser et al . 2010 , 2012 ; shankar et al . 2013 ; welker et al . 2015 ; rodriguez - gomez et al . 2016 ) .",
    "this effect is more pronounced with agn feedback since the in situ star formation is regulated by agn activity , at the benefit of the accreted stellar mass in the overall stellar mass budget ( dubois et al .",
    "2013 , 2016 ) .    in order to derive a more quantitative evolution",

    "we also note that h@xmath0 mean stellar density slopes increase rapidly at high redshift ( @xmath141 ) and then stall at lower @xmath125 , as a consequence of the evolution of black holes growth and agn activity history reported in fig .",

    "finally , @xmath144 is monotonously increasing for the most massive galaxies ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "this is explained by two main reasons .",
    "first , agn activity rapidly flattens h@xmath0 galaxy density profiles at high redshift , and second , the mass of h@xmath1 galaxies is still noticeably increasing down to @xmath6 , as there is no upper limit in this mass range .",

    "note again that the additional refinement levels have a limited but noticeable impact on the evolution of @xmath144 . the extra star formation spuriously induced at these epochs increases the central stellar mass , especially in h@xmath1 galaxies , which causes the more pronounced increases seen in the evolution of @xmath144 .",
    "however these numerical effects do not affect our conclusions .",
    "all along the paper so far , we have only carried out object - to - object comparisons to ensure that we study the properties and evolution of the same objects in the different simulations . however , one can also be interested in comparing the evolution of the properties of objects of similar mass between the three simulations , which is not enforced by the matching strategy . in this section",

    "stellar density profiles of galaxies prove to be very different .",

    "however , in order to compensate for the extra mass enclosed within these regions , they also exhibit lower densities at large radii .",
    "thus , for a galaxy of a given mass , agn feedback leads to density profiles that are more centrally flat but also more extended .",
    "by comparing results from two state - of - the - art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations whose only difference is the presence / absence of agn feedback , and one cosmological simulation without baryons which otherwise shares the same initial conditions , we have explored the impact of agn feedback on the evolution of the inner density profiles of massive dark matter haloes and galaxies .",

    "the impact of agn feedback in the flattening of dm haloes / galaxies density profiles is all the more important than the objects are massive .",
    "the present study clearly demonstrates that the inner density profiles of dark matter haloes and galaxies are very sensitive to sub - grid physics and more specifically to agn feedback .",
    "for instance , our model predicts a 3-phase scenario in the evolution of dark matter density profiles which is intimately associated with the strength of agn activity via the contribution of the different accretion modes on the central bh .",

    "( 2008 ) , repetitive cycles of gas expansion by agn feedback and gas cooling are requested to efficiently flatten the dark matter profiles .",

    "furthermore , we also found that the radio mode tends to be the dominant mode after @xmath111 , which renders the expansion phase of the gas more difficult .",
    "future accurate observations will allow to confirm these theoretical predictions , but , above all , will help constraining agn models .",

    "we mainly focused on the inner part of dark matter haloes density profiles where clear differences can been seen between the different simulations .",
    "conversely , for a given mass sample , the density profiles of h@xmath0 haloes and their matching h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 haloes converge and become identical at distances @xmath152 kpc , which suggests that these outer regions are not affected by baryons and agn feedback .",
    "however , previous works indicate that agn feedback is also expected to produce effect on larger scales .",
    "for instance , agn feedback is essential to produce massive galaxies that resemble ellipticals . without bh activity , massive galaxies are disc - like with kinematics dominated by rotational support ( see dubois et al . , 2013 ;",

    "<S> using a suite of three large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , , ( no agn feedback ) and ( no baryons ) , we investigate how a typical sub - grid model for agn feedback affects the evolution of the inner density profiles of massive dark matter haloes and galaxies . based on direct object - to - object comparisons , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the integrated inner mass and density slope differences between objects formed in these three simulations ( hereafter , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 ) significantly evolve with time . more specifically , at high redshift ( @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the mean central density profiles of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 dark matter haloes tend to be much steeper than their h@xmath2 counterparts owing to the rapidly growing baryonic component and ensuing adiabatic contraction . </S>",
    "<S> by @xmath4 , these mean halo density profiles in h@xmath0 have flattened , pummelled by powerful agn activity ( `` quasar mode '' ) : the integrated inner mass difference gaps with h@xmath5 haloes have widened , and those with h@xmath2 haloes have narrowed . fast forward </S>",
    "<S> 9.5 billion years , down to @xmath6 , and the trend reverses : h@xmath0 halo mean density profiles drift back to a more cusped shape as agn feedback efficiency dwindles ( `` radio mode '' ) , and the gaps in integrated central mass difference with h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 close and broaden respectively . on the galaxy side , </S>",
    "<S> the story differs noticeably . </S>",
    "<S> averaged stellar profile central densities and inner slopes are monotonically reduced by agn activity as a function of cosmic time , resulting in better agreement with local observations . </S>",
    "<S> as both dark matter and stellar inner density profiles respond quite sensitively to the presence of a central agn , there is hope that future observational determinations of these quantities can be used constrain agn feedback models .    </S>",
