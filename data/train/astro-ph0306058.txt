    "the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on the cosmic background explorer(cobe ) satellite was designed to measure the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) .",
    "the results from the dirbe team s analysis of the dirbe data are described in @xcite .",
    "these depend in a very fundamental way on the model for the zodiacal or interplanetary dust cloud that was fit to the variation of the dirbe signal as a function of solar elongation @xcite . but",
    "this zodiacal model leaves a large residual intensity at 25  which must be due to underestimating the zodiacal background , at least at 25 . new models @xcite which address this problem are used here to derive new lower values for the cirb .",
    "other approaches @xcite that use only a small fraction of the dirbe data to derive a zodiacal model have given higher values for the cirb .",
    "these results are unlikely to be true , but the dominant systematic uncertainty in deriving the cirb from observations taken 1 au from the sun remains the uncertainty in fitting the zodiacal light .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the final analysis @xcite of the firas low frequency channel data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) showed a spectrum with rms residuals from a blackbody of 50 ppm of the peak , or 20 kjy / sr .",
    "how is this result compatible with scuba results that claim to see an integrated intensity from source counts of 86 kjy / sr @xcite ?",
    "one explanation is that later more extensive observations @xcite give lower source counts and @xmath1  kjy / sr for @xmath2  mjy .",
    "a second explanation is that the firas analysis for cmb distortions was designed to be insensitive to any foreground that had the spectral shape of the milky way .",
    "thus the cirb at 850  can be quite large if the cirb spectrum is similar to the milky way spectrum .",
    "equation ( 3 ) from @xcite gives this model for small deviations of the cmb from a blackbody : @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes some distortion . in order to see how compatible different models for the cosmic sub - mm background are with the firas low frequency channel data ,",
    "i compute the following : @xmath5_{\\nu,\\nu^\\prime } ( i_0(\\nu^\\prime ) - p { { \\partial s_c}\\over{\\partial p}})\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath6 being the covariance matrix , and let @xmath4 be the sub - mm background intensity at 850 , while @xmath7 gives the shape of the spectrum . thus @xmath8 is the spectrum normalized to the 850  value .",
    "figure [ fig : i850 ] shows the @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath10 curves for four different models of the sub - mm background .",
    "the two models with the high values of @xmath10 have the best and the worst @xmath9 , while the models with lower intensities at 850  have marginal @xmath9 s . the model with the highest @xmath9 is the analytic fit @xmath11 from @xcite , but this model was designed to fit the peak of the cirb near 200 , and not the faint low snr region near 850 .",
    "table [ tab : i850 ] gives the values of @xmath12 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath13 for the model with the best @xmath9 in figure [ fig : i850 ] .",
    "i designed the shape of this model near 850  to make it compatible with the firas limits .",
    "this is also the curve shown in figure [ fig : coibr ] .",
    "clearly more work is needed to determine @xmath10 , and this requires a better indicator of the total galactic column density including all types of matter : h  i , h  ii , and h@xmath0 .",
    "i have presented here results from the dirbe and firas observations of the cirb and the milky way . both the milky way and",
    "the cirb show a bigger peak in the near infrared than in the far infrared .",
    "the total intensity is nearly 10% of the power in the cmb blackbody .",
    "while the cirb is probably the integrated light from many unresolved galaxies , there is a discrepancy between galaxy photometry and the near infrared and optical cirb , with the directly measured cirb being about two times brighter than the intensity from source counts .",
    "the most probable explanation of this discrepancy is undercounting the faint outer parts of galaxies .",
