    "in the last two decades , complex network theory has emerged as a popular tool for analyzing complex and spatially extended systems @xcite .",
    "it has found applications in a wide range of fields including sociology @xcite , communication @xcite and biological sciences @xcite .",
    "the theory of complex networks initially started with random graphs ( rg ) studied in detail by erds and r ' enyi ( e - r ) @xcite .",
    "for rgs , there is a fixed probability @xmath1 for two nodes being connected and one can show that for a sufficiently large number of nodes @xmath2 , the degree distribution @xmath3 tends to a poissonian .",
    "the e - r model guided our thinking about complex networks for many decades until the discovery by barabasi and co - workers @xcite nearly two decades back that the topology and structure of most networks around us are radically different .",
    "for example , many networks in the real world such as , the world wide web ( www ) @xcite , networks of social interactions @xcite , protein and metabolic networks @xcite and technological networks @xcite , tend to obey certain self - organizing principles in their evolution either due to some inherent property of the system or due to the nature of human interactions as in social networks .",
    "the topology of such networks shows a _ scale invariance _ with the degree distribution obeying a power law , @xmath4 , and the value of @xmath5 is found to be typically between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the discovery of such _ scale - free _",
    "( sf ) networks triggered a lot of interest in the theory of complex networks .",
    "along with the discovery of sf networks , the concept of _ small - world _ ( sw ) networks was introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite .",
    "though the classical rgs are amenable to a great deal of mathematical analysis , they are poor models as far as real networks are concerned .",
    "firstly , they show poor clustering and their clustering coefficient ( cc ) is directly proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , for a given @xmath1 , as the number of nodes @xmath2 increases , the average degree @xmath8 also increases correspondingly .",
    "consequently , for @xmath1 above a threshold value , the characteristic path length ( cpl ) of rgs remains very small and independent of @xmath2 .",
    "watts and strogatz ( w - s ) showed that , starting from a ring lattice of @xmath2 nodes with nearest neighbour coupling and randomly re - wiring a small fraction @xmath9 of edges , results in a complex network with high cc compared to the rg and small cpl comparable to that of a rg for a range of values of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , for such networks , as @xmath2 increases , the cpl increases only as @xmath10 @xmath2 .",
    "thus the w - s model displays many characteristic properties of real world networks and provides one possibility of obtaining the sw property , often found in real world networks , with different levels of complexity by tuning @xmath9 .",
    "the above developments resulted in complex networks and the related measures being applied as tools in many areas of research .",
    "the most recent among them is the analysis of time series from dynamical systems using statistical measures of complex networks . to study many dynamical processes in the real world",
    ", one often resorts to the analysis of time series obtained from the system .",
    "an area of special interest is where the underlying system appears to show deterministic nonlinear behavior .",
    "the methods and measures of nonlinear time series analysis and chaos theory @xcite are commonly used in such cases . in the last few years",
    ", measures based on complex networks have gained a lot of importance in nonlinear time series analysis .",
    "all such measures propose a mapping from the time series domain to the network domain and then proceed to characterize the dynamical system in terms of the statistical measures of the resulting complex network . by doing this ,",
    "one expects to resolve complimentary features that are not captured by conventional methods of time series analysis , especially the structural and topological properties of the underlying chaotic attractor .    even though several methods have been proposed @xcite to convert time series into networks , an approach incorporating the generic property of _ recurrence _",
    "@xcite of a dynamical system has been prominently applied for the conversion of time series into networks . in this method ,",
    "the time series is first embedded in a suitable dimension @xmath11 using time delay co - ordinates @xcite to reconstruct the attractor . every point on the attractor",
    "is identified as a node and the network can be constructed in two ways , either by taking a fixed number of nearest neighbours @xcite or by taking a fixed hyper - sphere of radius @xmath0 with the point as the centre . in this work ,",
    "we consider the second method for the construction of the network where a reference node @xmath12 is connected to another node @xmath13 if the euclidean distance @xmath14 between the corresponding points on the attractor in the reconstructed space is less than or equal to the recurrence threshold @xmath0 , that is , if @xmath15 . the resulting complex network , called the @xmath0 - recurrence network or simply recurrence network ( rn ) @xcite , has been shown to have great potential for a wide range of practical applications , from identifying critical transitions in dynamical systems @xcite to the classification of cardio - vascular time series @xcite .",
    "note that , by construction , the rn is an undirected and unweighted graph with a symmetric and binary adjacency matrix @xmath16 , with elements @xmath17 or @xmath18 , depending on whether the two nodes @xmath12 and @xmath13 are connected or not .",
    "- component using time step @xmath19 with time delay @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the time series and the embedded attractor",
    "are shown ( top and bottom , respectively ) in the left panel while the rn and its degree distribution are shown in the right panel .",
    "the rn is constructed taking every point on the attractor as a node and connecting every node to all other nodes within a recurrence threshold of @xmath22 ( see text ) .",
    "error bars of @xmath3 originate from the fact that for a network with @xmath2 nodes , the number @xmath23 of nodes with a given degree @xmath24 has a standard error of @xmath25 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "its value is normalised to @xmath27 , the minimum count.,width=604 ]    though rns and related statistical measures are widely applied in nonlinear time series analysis , their properties , as the threshold is increased , are not fully understood from a complex network perspective .",
    "it is well known that all rns have two properties in common .",
    "firstly , the degree distribution of every rn is unique and is closely related to the probability density variations over the embedded attractor from which it is mapped @xcite",
    ". we will discuss this in detail below .",
    "secondly , there is an absence of long range connections as the maximum edge length is limited by the recurrence threshold @xmath0 . by definition ,",
    "rns are random geometric graphs ( rgg ) in the considered system s phase space @xcite . here",
    "rggs are rgs where each vertex is randomly assigned co - ordinates in some metric space according to some prescribed probability distribution function , and vertices are connected if and only if they are separated by less than a certain maximum distance @xcite .    in this letter , we numerically investigate the specific properties of rns using three primary measures of a complex network , the degree distribution , the cc and the cpl .",
    "in particular , we consider the range of threshold values beyond the small operational window usually used for the construction of the rn and check whether the resulting network can show the properties of either rgs or sf networks or behave as a small - world network .",
    "all numerical simulations are done using @xmath28 nodes , unless otherwise mentioned . for the construction of sf networks",
    ", we use the specific scheme of preferential attachment discussed in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we start with a small number of nodes @xmath29 . a new node is then added which gets connected to @xmath30 number of existing nodes .",
    "this process is repeated , increasing the number of edges by @xmath30 for each newly connected node . by changing either @xmath29 or @xmath30",
    "we can construct sf networks with different @xmath5 .",
    "here we do both and construct the sf networks using 3 values for @xmath29 ( 2 , 4 and 10 ) and in each case , use 3 different values for @xmath30 , namely , 1 , 2 and 4 .",
    "moreover , the rgs are constructed for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "time series from several standard low - dimensional chaotic systems are used for the construction of rns . for continuous systems ( flows ) in 3d , we use the embedding dimension @xmath21 and for discrete systems ( maps ) in 2d , we use @xmath31 . for all systems",
    ", we use the time series from the @xmath32 - component and for all continuous systems , the time step @xmath33 used for numerical integration is @xmath34 with the time delay computed by the automated algorithmic scheme proposed by us @xcite .",
    "the values of time delay used for the rssler , lorenz , duffing and ueda systems are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .    to get a quantitatively comparable value for the percolation threshold @xmath0 and to make the comparison between systems possible",
    ", we first transform the time series to a uniform deviate so that the size of the reconstructed attractor is re - scaled into a unit cube in @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "this transformation is not a trivial rescaling as it stretches the embedded attractor uniformly in all directions .",
    "we have already shown @xcite how effective this transformation is in computing conventional measures such as , correlation dimension @xmath39 and entropy @xmath40 , for low as well as high - dimensional systems from time series @xcite . as a result of the uniform",
    "deviate transformation , we have found that it is possible to have a small identical range of recurrence threshold @xmath41 , that can be taken as the operational window for constructing the rn from time series of different systems for a given embedding dimension @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "here we choose the value of @xmath0 as the minimum of this range where the giant component of the rn just appears , as suggested by donges et al . @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is found to be @xmath42 for @xmath31 and @xmath43 for @xmath21 for @xmath44 as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the rn from a random ( white noise ) time series is also constructed using @xmath21 ( for comparison with the rns from chaotic systems ) whose degree distribution is poissonian with @xmath45 for the selected @xmath0 . we find that this distribution coincides with the degree distributions of a rg for @xmath46 nodes with @xmath47 and a rgg in @xmath7 dimensions with the spatial range of connections limited to the same threshold @xmath22 as that of the rn . to draw the connection with the percolation threshold of the rn , one can refer to @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] , we show the construction of a typical rn from a standard rssler attractor time series .",
    "the node degrees of the rn vary over a wide range determined by the local probability density variations over the attractor .",
    "specifically , the topology of the rn closely resembles that of the embedded attractor , with nodes corresponding to regions of high probability density in the attractor having higher degree in the rn and vice versa .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] .",
    "ranges are also indicated .",
    "the parameters used for all the systems are given in @xcite .",
    "we observe that the position where @xmath48 decreases sharply follows a pattern in accordance with the dimension of the attractor.,width=604 ]     nodes in all cases except the w - s network .",
    "we show the results for @xmath7 sf networks ( solid triangles ) with @xmath49 , @xmath7 rgs ( solid circles ) with link probability @xmath50 and @xmath7 w - s small - world networks ( solid squares ) with @xmath51 nodes ( to reduce computation time and memory ) using @xmath52 . in all cases ,",
    "the size of the symbols increases with the values of @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the open star on the right side corresponds to the rn from a random time series and the asterisk corresponds to a rgg with the range of connection limited to that of the rns in @xmath7 dimension , namely , @xmath22 .",
    "these two networks are completely different from the other networks in terms of cpl - cc values.,width=604 ]    as the dynamical system evolves , the probability density over the attractor is preserved .",
    "the degree @xmath53 of a reference node @xmath12 represents the local connectivity of the rn and corresponds to the local phase space density around the reference point in the attractor .",
    "it has already been shown @xcite that the local probability density variation is reflected in the degree distribution of the rn : @xmath54 for a given @xmath11 , where @xmath55 is the invariant density around the point @xmath56 . in the light of this equation",
    ", @xmath57 can be called the _ degree density _ @xcite .",
    "the above equation tells us that the distribution in terms of the degree density remains invariant for a given attractor as has been explicitly shown by us earlier @xcite .    due to this close connection with the invariant density",
    ", the degree distribution also carries important structural information on the corresponding chaotic attractor in a subtle manner . to show this explicitly",
    ", we consider the cumulative degree distribution of the rns from several low - dimensional chaotic attractors .",
    "this representation is often used in the analysis of power - law degree distributions to retrieve the _ scaling _ that is not visible in the power - law tail .",
    "it has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite in connection with the analysis of sf networks and is defined as @xmath58 it can be shown that if @xmath3 is a power - law with exponent @xmath5 , then @xmath48 will also follow a power - law with exponent @xmath59 . here",
    "we make use of @xmath48 only to get a better comparison between the degree distributions of various chaotic attractors .    in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] , we show the variation of @xmath10 @xmath48 as a function of @xmath10 @xmath24 for rn from several low - dimensional chaotic attractors and random time series .",
    "the parameters used for the generation of all the chaotic attractors are given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "in all cases , we use the @xmath32 - component of the system with time step @xmath34 for continuous systems .",
    "note that the position of the tail of the distribution follows a pattern in accordance with the dimension @xmath39 of the attractor . to get a possible explanation for this observation",
    ", we have studied the actual distribution @xmath3 of the rns . in all cases",
    ", there is a range of @xmath24 values and a particular @xmath24 value , say @xmath60 , at which @xmath3 has a maximum value .",
    "the cumulative distribution starts decreasing sharply as @xmath24 exeeds @xmath60 .",
    "now , the value of @xmath60 increases with the range of @xmath24 values which , in turn , depends on the clustering of points on the attractor , as the attractor is converted into the network . for h ' enon and lozi attractors , the clustering is maximum as they are characterized by a lower @xmath39 value and consequently the range of @xmath24 values is maximum .",
    "this makes their profile getting shifted to extreme right .",
    "as @xmath39 increases , the range of @xmath24 values and hence @xmath60 decreases due to the rescaling of all systems to the unit cube , shifting the tail to lower @xmath24 values . for the random time",
    "series , when computed from a finite time series with embedding dimension @xmath11 , we get @xmath61 and the range is minimum with @xmath62 and hence the tail of @xmath48 is located at the extreme left .",
    "the above argument is supported by numerical results from earlier studies @xcite , if the local clustering coefficient can be understood analytically from the theory of random geometric graphs as being associated to a `` mean local clustering dimension '' defined in @xcite , which should behave similar to the classical correlation dimension @xmath39 considered here .",
    "next , we consider how the rns are different with respect to the other two measures , cc and cpl .",
    "we generate an ensemble of sf networks with different @xmath5 values using the specific scheme of preferential attachment as mentioned above and rgs with different link probability @xmath1 .",
    "the cpl is defined by the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the shortest path length for all pairs of nodes @xmath65 in the network .",
    "the cc of the network is defined through a local clustering coefficient @xmath66 which measures the probability that two randomly chosen neighbours of a given vertex @xmath67 are mutually linked . for finite graphs ,",
    "this is estimated @xcite in terms of relative frequency of links between the neighbouring vertices for the node @xmath67 . @xmath68",
    "the average value of @xmath66 is taken as the cc of the whole network : @xmath69     different values of @xmath2 , namely , @xmath70 and @xmath71 with the point denoted as @xmath27 representing @xmath72 .",
    "for comparison , values for a rg ( with @xmath73 ) and a sf network ( with @xmath74 ) with the same @xmath2 values are also shown.,width=604 ]     is increased from a value close to the percolation threshold @xmath22 with @xmath21 .",
    "the rn first undergoes a smooth transition to a network with high cc ( @xmath75 ) and small cpl ( @xmath76 ) , capable of showing sw property for an intermediate range of @xmath0 approximately between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "as @xmath79 , the rn is found to cross over to the classical rg ( in the limit @xmath80 , where both cc and cpl @xmath81 independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we also show the variation of cc and cpl for a w - s network as a function of the re - wiring probability @xmath9 ( solid line ) and the same for a rg with connection probability @xmath1 ( dashed line ) .",

    "[ f.3 ] using a combined cpl - cc graph for @xmath28 in all cases except the w - s network .",
    "we have shown the values for the rn of a random time series and those from @xmath7 different sf networks , rgs and w - s small - world networks .",
    "the values for a rgg in @xmath7 dimensions with the range limited to that of the rn ( in @xmath7 dimensions ) are also shown .",
    "two results are evident from the figure .",
    "the cpl values of all networks except the rn and rgg are very small and always @xmath82 .",
    "secondly , the rg with @xmath47 , whose degree distribution coincides with that of the rn from the random time series behaves completely differently in the cpl - cc graph .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the absence of long range connections in the rn .",
    "in fact , this is true for all rns and this property can not change with the increase in the number of nodes @xmath2 .",
    "both cpl and cc are found to converge and saturate to a finite value for all rns and can not fall below a certain limiting value which depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this limiting value is much higher compared to the typical values for sf networks and rgs .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.4 ] using rns constructed from several standard chaotic attractors with @xmath2 varying from @xmath83 to @xmath71 .",
    "our numerical results show that rns , constructed with @xmath0 within the usual operational window , can not show sw property .",
    "@xmath2 for rns corresponding to the @xmath7 ranges of threshold @xmath0 used for the construction of the network .",
    "the top panel ( a ) corresponds to @xmath0 within the range of recurrence thresholds where the rn represents the characteristic properties of the attractor and the cpl converges to a limiting value as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the middle panel ( b ) corresponds to intermediate values of @xmath0 ( between @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) where the rn is capable of displaying the sw property as cpl increases linearly with @xmath10 @xmath2 .",
    "the bottom panel ( c ) corresponds to large values of @xmath0 ( @xmath84 ) where the rn has long range connections and the cpl tends to a small value independent of @xmath2 . for ( b ) , the value of @xmath0 is tuned within the respective range keeping @xmath8 constant as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "we find the sw property for a range of @xmath8 values between @xmath85 to @xmath86 depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the graph in ( b ) is plotted with @xmath87 and decreasing @xmath0 as @xmath2 is increased by fixing @xmath88 . in all three cases shown above ,",
    "the solid triangles connected by a dashed line represent the cpl of lorenz attractor while the solid circles connected by a solid line represent that from random time series.,width=604 ]    suppose that we now increase the value of @xmath0 above the recurrence threshold which , in turn , increases the range of spatial connection for each node in the rn",
    ". the resulting rn may not be able to characterize the statistical properties of the embedded attractor , but one can look at the properties of the resulting network from a complex network perspective .",
    "for example , in the case of spatial networks , such as , communication and transportation networks , barthelemy @xcite has shown that as the interaction range between nodes is of the order of system size or larger , the spatial effects become negligible and the networks tend to show sf property .",
    "rns are _ spatially constrained _ networks and hence we now check whether , under some limiting conditions , the rns can show properties of either sw networks or classical rgs .    in fig .",
    "[ f.5 ] , we show the variation of cc and cpl for the rns from random time series and lorenz attractor as a function of @xmath0 . while the cc shows a steady increase with @xmath0 , the cpl decreases much more quickly initially and saturates to the minimum possible value of @xmath27 .",
    "we also show the cc and cpl for the rg ( dashed line ) for increasing values of @xmath1 and a typical watts - strogatz sw network ( solid line ) as a function of increasing re - wiring probability @xmath9 .",
    "we find that for an intermediate range of @xmath0 values , approximately from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , the rns show high cc ( @xmath75 ) and small cpl ( @xmath76 ) which are the basic criteria for a network to show the small - world property . to check this",
    ", we increase the value of @xmath2 keeping the average degree @xmath8 approximately constant by changing the value of @xmath0 within the above range ( between @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) and compute the value of cpl as function of @xmath10 @xmath2 .",
    "the result , presented in fig .  [ f.6 ] ( b ) , clearly shows the small - world property .",
    "thus , the intermediate range of @xmath0 can be considered as a small - world phase for the rns . as @xmath0 further increases and tends to the system size , all rns smoothly cross over to the classical rgs with high @xmath1 where the cpl and cc @xmath81 independent of @xmath2 . to get a comparison of the behaviour between different regimes of @xmath0",
    ", we also show the variation of cpl with @xmath10 @xmath2 for rn with @xmath0 equal to the recurrence threshold in fig .",
    "[ f.6 ] ( a ) and for the case of long range connections with @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ f.6 ] ( c ) .",
    "we have checked this result for two more standard chaotic attractors , namely , the rssler attractor and the duffing attractor and found an identical behavior .",
    "hence , based on our numerical results , we conjecture that all rns pass through an intermediate small - world phase as the value of @xmath0 is increased , before undergoing a transition to the classical rg for large @xmath0 .",
    "our result provides a method for constructing a sw network from time series of dynamical systems by adjusting the range of connections between the nodes .",
    "the result is also relevant to search for the sw property in network models that require a multi - dimensional system with a metric , as for example in the case of spreading of diseases @xcite , in continuous percolation theory @xcite and in the study of random walks on fractals @xcite .",
    "for example , it is well known @xcite that the spreading of diseases can be modeled by a rgg . if the nature of spreading is limited to nearest neighbour interaction ( say , controlled by contact only )",
    ", the network can not show sw property .",
    "however , if the spreading occurs by other means , so that the range @xmath0 is large , the network can very well switch over to a sw .",
    "in this letter , we analyse the rns , which are unweighted and undirected graphs , from a complex network perspective",
    ". three primary characteristics of a network , namely , the degree distribution , the cc ( an averaged local measure ) and the cpl ( a global measure ) are used for the analysis .",
    "we find that the degree distribution of every rn is unique and characteristic to the probability density variations over the representative attractor . by computing the cc and the cpl of several rns from standard chaotic attractors ,",
    "we explicitly show that the rns constructed with the recurrence threshold at and just above the percolation threshold are basically different with both cc and cpl being high due to the absence of long range connections between the nodes .",
    "the characteristic properties of the rn change with the value of @xmath0 used to construct it . as @xmath90 , cpl @xmath91 and cc @xmath92 . for values of @xmath0 below the recurrence threshold ,",
    "the rn consists of several disconnected clusters . for @xmath0 within the operational window above the percolation threshold ,",
    "the network becomes globally connected ( with the appearance of a giant component ) and the rn measures characterize the statistical properties of the underlying system . in this phase",
    ", cpl remains relatively high ( with the network unable show sw property ) and converges to an asymptotic value as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "when the value of @xmath0 is increased further , the constraints induced by the short connectivity range slowly disappear with the emergence of long range connections and all the rns initially cross over to a sw phase with high cc and small cpl that increases as @xmath10 @xmath2 . finally , as the value of @xmath79 , the rn undergoes a smooth transition to classical rgs with @xmath93 with both cpl and cc @xmath81 independent of the number of nodes n. thus , for all rns , there are basically three phases in terms of the range of @xmath0 values used for the construction of the rn , namely , a small operational window of @xmath0 that captures the statistical properties of the corresponding attractor , an intermediate range where the rn can display the sw property and finally @xmath0 of the order of the size of the attractor where the rn crosses over to the classical rg .",
