    "one of the biggest surprises in the exoplanet field was the discovery of gas giant planets orbiting very close to their host star .",
    "these hot jupiter planets represent one extreme of the galaxy s population of planets , and they provide important constraints to guide our nascent ideas about the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "the probability of transit for close - in giant planets is @xmath0 @xcite , and through the analysis of transit light curves the ratio of the stellar and planetary radii can be deduced . through the significant uncertainties in the mass and radius of any particular star ,",
    "our characterisation of exoplanets is limited by that of their host stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , it is important to directly measure the properties of planet hosting stars , particularly in cases where we expect the presence of planets may have influenced the properties of the star through star - planet interactions .",
    "one of the most extreme hot jupiter exoplanets is wasp-12b , a gas giant planet orbiting only 0.023au from a late f - type host star @xcite .",
    "wasp-12b s orbit is , therefore , only about 1.5 stellar diameters from the photosphere of the star . at such proximity ,",
    "interactions between the star and the planet must occur .",
    "near - uv observations of wasp-12 covering the wavelengths of many resonance lines reveal that wasp-12b is surrounded by an exosphere which appears to overfill its roche lobe @xcite",
    ". this exospheric gas may be the consequence of tidal disruption of the planet s convective envelope as recently suggested by @xcite , but it could also be entrained material from the stellar corona .",
    "a planet orbiting as close as wasp-12b might be expected to interact magnetically with its host star , c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a first step to search for such interactions is to detect and quantify the stellar magnetic field by spectropolarimetry , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field belonging to wasp-12 would provide a precious piece of information needed to establish which mechanism controls the structure and the evolution of the disk @xcite .",
    "the solar system s giant planets have enhanced metal abundances relative to the sun @xcite and high atmospheric metal abundances have been suggested as a contributing factor in the inflated radii of planets such as wasp-12b @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite detected a wealth of metallic atoms and ions in the exospheric gas surrounding wasp-12b .",
    "if this gas is indeed accreting onto the host star as suggested by @xcite , this could lead to abundance anomalies in the photosphere of wasp-12 . since wasp-12 is expected to have a very shallow surface convection zone",
    ", any accreted gas will remain close to the surface rendering any pollution of the surface composition relatively easy to detect .    in this paper , we report on spectropolarimetric observations of wasp-12 which we use to probe the stellar magnetic field , fundamental parameters and abundance pattern of the star . in sect .",

    "we observed wasp-12 using the   ( echelle spectropolarimetric device for observations of stars ) spectropolarimeter at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on the 3rd and 5th of january 2010 .",
    "the observations were performed in  polarimetric \" mode .",

    "the instrument can acquire a stokes @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) profile throughout the spectral range 370010400  with a resolving power of about 65000 .",
    "a complete polarimetric observation consists of a sequence of 4 sub - exposures @xcite .",
    "each of the four sub - exposures was 1290seconds long , with a total amount of integration time of 1.5hrs , each night .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the libre - esprit package @xcite .",
    "the stokes @xmath1 spectra have a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per pixel of @xmath5126 and @xmath5158 in the continuum , on the first and second nights respectively ; both values calculated at 5000 . to increase the snr of the stokes @xmath1 spectrum we averaged the two available spectra , obtaining a single spectrum with a snr of @xmath5200 , normalised by fitting a low order polynomial to carefully selected continuum points .",
    "the effective temperature ( ) was determined ( see sect .  [ parameters ] ) from our  data and two spectra of wasp-12 obtained at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) .",
    "the spectra cover the region of the h@xmath6 line with a spectral resolution of @xmath7=8000 ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "we also used near - uv observations obtained with the hst cosmic origin spectrograph ( cos ) @xcite for the analysis of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "the spectra , calibrated in flux , cover three non - contiguous wavelength ranges in the near - uv with a resolution of @xmath820000 .",
    "these observations are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "to compute model atmospheres of wasp-12 we employed the  stellar model atmosphere code @xcite .",
    "for all the calculations local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and plane - parallel geometry were assumed .",
    "we used the  database @xcite as a source of atomic line parameters for opacity calculations .",
    "the recent vald compilation contains information for about @xmath9 atomic transitions , most of them coming from the latest theoretical calculations performed by r.  kurucz .",
    "convection was implemented according to the @xcite model of convection ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "@xcite derived the fundamental parameters of wasp-12 from the analysis of low and mid - resolution spectra , obtaining = 6300@xmath10150k , = 4.38@xmath100.10 , and adopting a value of 0.85  for the microturbulence velocity ( ) .",
    "we used these values as our starting point in an iterative process to gradually improve the parameters using different spectroscopic indicators . in our analysis ,",
    "every time any of , ,  or abundances changed during the iteration process , we recalculated a new model with the implementation of the last measured quantities .",
    "similarly the derived abundances were treated iteratively : while the results of the abundance analysis depend upon the assumed model atmosphere , the atmospheric temperature - pressure structure itself depends upon the adopted abundances , so we recalculated the model atmosphere every time abundances were changed , even if the other model parameters were fixed .",
    "this ensures the model structure is consistent with the assumed abundances .",
    "we determined  by fitting synthetic line profiles , calculated with  @xcite , to the observed profiles of two hydrogen lines : h@xmath6 ( from the ids spectrograph ) and h@xmath11 ( from the  spectropolarimeter ) .",
    "we discarded the other hydrogen lines observed with  because of the uncertainties in the continuum normalisation .",
    "in the temperature range expected for wasp-12 , hydrogen lines are extremely sensitive to temperature variations and insensitive to   variations , and are therefore good temperature indicators .",
    "we found = 6250@xmath10100k , in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty estimate considered both the quality of the observations and the uncertainties in the normalisation .",
    "figure  [ hydrogen ] shows the comparison between the observed h@xmath6 line profile and the synthetic profiles calculated with the adopted  of 6250@xmath10100k .",
    "the poor fit of the hydrogen line core is due to the adopted lte approximation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ equilibria ] , produced using the final adopted fundamental parameters , shows no significant correlation between abundance and  for all ions , except , for which we registered a slightly positive correlation ( 0.02263@xmath100.01139 ) , that would be eliminated by a higher .",
    "what we found here for resambles what remarked by @xcite for hd  49933 and hd  32115 ( both stars have a  slightly higher than wasp-12 ) : an effective temperature determination based only on the analysis of lines leads systematically to a  that is substantially higher ( by about 5% ) , compared to the one obtained with other ions and in particular with other temperature indicators , such as hydrogen lines .",
    "for this reason , we decided to use the analysis of the metallic lines only as consistency check of  derived from the hydrogen lines .",

    "the surface gravity was derived from two independent methods based on ( _ i _ ) line profile fitting of gravity - sensitive metal lines with developed wings and ( _ ii _ ) ionisation balance for several elements .",
    "the first method is described in @xcite and uses the fact that the wings of the lines at @xmath125167 , 5172 and 5183  are very sensitive to  variations . in practice",
    "we first derived the mg abundance from other lines without developed wings , such as @xmath125711 and 5785 , and then we fit the wings of the gravity indicator lines by tuning the  value . to apply this method , very accurate  values and van der waals ( log@xmath13 ) damping constants",
    "are required for all the lines .",
    "we adopted the set of line parameters used by @xcite and included the uncertainty in these parameters in the uncertainty in .",

    "our line profile fit of the lines with developed wings is shown in fig .",

    "we adopted the same combination of  and van der waals damping constants as in @xcite : oscillator strengths from @xcite and damping constants from @xcite . ]    the second method , the ionisation equilibrium , is often used to derive the surface gravity , but this method is extremely sensitive to the  effects present for each ion / element , while mg lines with developed wings ( less sensitive to  effects ) are more suitable as  indicators @xcite .",
    "for this reason we decided to keep the mg lines as our primary  indicator , and checked the result with the ionisation equilibrium . adopting the  value obtained from the analysis of the lines with developed wings and taking into account the abundance uncertainties , we satisfied the ionisation equilibrium for every element with two analysed ions .",
    "our main source for the atomic parameters of spectral lines is the   database with the default configuration .",
    "lte abundance analysis was based on equivalent widths , analysed with a modified version @xcite of the width9 code @xcite . for all analysed elements / ions we used almost all unblended spectral lines with accurate atomic parameters available in the wavelength range 42409900 , except lines in spectral regions where the continuum normalisation was too uncertain . for blended lines , lines subjected to hyperfine splitting ( ) , lines situated in the wings of the hydrogen lines or for very shallow lines of specific ions we derived the line abundance by performing synthetic spectrum calculations with the  code .",
    "the   constants for abundance calculations were taken from @xcite for lines and from @xcite for the line at @xmath126707 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]      one of the main purpose of this work is to search for chemical peculiarities that could be connected with pollution of the stellar atmosphere by material lost by the planet .",
    "this can be done in different ways , as also shown in the extensive salient literature present ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "wasp-12 is a promising target for signs of atmospheric pollution : wasp-12b is most likely currently losing material @xcite ; this material is believed to be forming a circumstellar disk that is accreting onto the star , polluting the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "classical ways of looking for atmospheric pollution are by searching : ( _ i _ ) chemical peculiarities of single elements , such as li and be ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "when searching for small effects on the stellar atmospheric abundances it is important to determine whether a certain star belongs to the thin or thick galactic disk population .",
    "to do so we performed both a kinematic and chemical analysis of wasp-12 .",
    "we calculated the galactic velocity vectors ( u , v , w ) corrected to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) using the formalism of @xcite , instead defining u as positive towards the galactic anti - centre . as done by @xcite , wasp-12 was then placed on the toomre diagram of the @xcite stellar sample , indicating that wasp-12 has a peculiar velocity less than 85 , strongly indicative of thin disk membership . from the wasp-12 abundances , we then compared our values of [ @xmath6/fe ] ( @xmath150.15dex ) and [ fe / h ] ( @xmath160.28dex ) , where [ @xmath6/fe ] is defined as 0.25([mg",

    "@xcite published lithium abundances of stars hosting a giant planet or a brown dwarf and compared them to a set of non - planet hosting stars .",

    "the detection of this kind of correlation requires very high precision abundances ( error bars @xmath22  0.05dex and free from systematic differences ) , attainable only with a differential analysis .",
    "the application of this method to wasp-12 would require observations of stars that can be considered twins of wasp-12 ( similar , metallicity , age , and population ) .",
    "the choice of the wasp-12 twins will be of crucial importance because effects such as diffusion , more prevalent for f - type stars than g - type stars , are strongly age and  dependent , and consequently could easily hide or mimic pollution signatures .",
    "our analysis does not lead to a firm conclusion about the atmospheric pollution of wasp-12 .      to check whether wasp-12 has a peculiar abundance pattern we compared the abundances with those obtained by other authors on a large number of stars with a similar .",

    "figure  [ fig.valenti ] shows that the abundances of ti and fe are clearly comparable to the ones of the higher metallicity subsample , as expected given the fact that [ fe / h ] of wasp-12 is about 0.3 .",
    "the na abundance of wasp-12 falls within the abundance range of the high - metallicity stars of the comparison sample , due to the large range covered by the na abundance , while ni shows a mean abundance that is just outside the abundance range .",
    "the si abundance looks definitely more similar to the one of the set of stars with 0.1@xmath22[fe / h]@xmath240.2dex , but the large uncertainty on this abundance does not allow any firm conclusion . in summary",
    "the abundances of ti and fe follow the pattern of the high - metallicity stars , while na , si , and ni seem to follow more the abundance pattern of the set of comparison stars with [ fe / h ] between 0.1 and 0.2dex .    the information gathered from this comparison lead to the conclusion that there is the possibility that the wasp-12 abundances of na , si , and ni do not really match the abundance pattern that the wasp-12 iron abundance would suggest .",
    "but it has to be taken into account that the comparison is not free from systematic differences in the fundamental parameters and abundance determinations , and in the set of adopted atomic line parameters .    for a further search of possible abundance peculiarities in the atmosphere of wasp-12 we decided to compare our results with those of several other authors",

    "for the other compared elements ( c , n , na , mg , si , s , ti , cr , co , and ni ) we obtained just a satisfactory agreement , since we register a tendency of the wasp-12 abundances of these elements to lay always in the lower margin of the comparison samples , in particular when the abundances are put in relation to the iron abundance .",

    "we obtained a good agreement for ti , but both si and ni appear to be depleted in wasp-12 , compared to the abundances obtained by @xcite in a set of planet hosting stars , therefore we can not confirm their conclusion of a systematic enrichment of si and ni in planet hosting compared to non - planet hosting stars",
    ".      the circumstellar disk , predicted by @xcite and tentatively observed by @xcite , could be detectable in the infrared .",
    "for this reason we decided to compare the calibrated near - uv cos fluxes of wasp-12 and the available photometry ( johnson and 2mass photometry ) with synthetic fluxes obtained with  adopting the fundamental parameters and the abundances derived from the  data , looking for an infrared excess in the 2mass photometry . for this comparison , shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig.flux ] does not show any clear infrared excess in the 2mass photometry that could be interpreted as : ( _ i _ ) there is no interstellar disk around the star or ( _ ii _ ) the interstellar disk is not visible because either the emission is not strong enough or the emission peaks at much longer wavelengths .",

    "given recent theoretical predictions @xcite and discoveries @xcite , the wasp-12 system seems to be an ideal target to detect the presence of atmospheric pollution , due to the material lost by the planet .",

    "one must also take into account the fact that it is not clear whether wasp-12 would show the same kind of atmospheric pollution shown by the sun @xcite : the material coming from wasp-12b and falling onto the star is in a gas / plasma state and only a detailed modeling of the temperature and density structure of the accretion disk would show whether the material is condensing in dust grains .",
    "if dust grains are forming it is likely that a differential analysis would reveal the kind of pollution signatures obtained for the sun , otherwise all the material lost by the planet would fall onto the star , making then the pollution signature dependent to the unknown hydrogen content of the planet .    with the use of the available hst calibrated spectra and of visible and infrared photometry",

    "<S> the knowledge of accurate stellar parameters is paramount in several fields of stellar astrophysics , particularly in the study of extrasolar planets , where often the star is the only visible component and therefore used to infer the planet s fundamental parameters . </S>",
    "<S> another important aspect of the analysis of planetary systems is the stellar activity and the possible star - planet interaction . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a self - consistent abundance analysis of the planet hosting star wasp-12 and a high - precision search for a structured stellar magnetic field on the basis of spectropolarimetric observations obtained with the   spectropolarimeter . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the star does not have a structured magnetic field , and that the obtained fundamental parameters are in good agreement with what was previously published . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we derive improved constraints on the stellar age ( 1.02.65gyr ) , mass ( 1.231.49 ) , and distance ( 295465pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> wasp-12 is an ideal object to look for pollution signatures in the stellar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the wasp-12 abundances as a function of the condensation temperature and compare them with those published by several other authors on planet hosting and non - planet hosting stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find hints of atmospheric pollution in wasp-12 s photosphere , but are unable to reach firm conclusions with our present data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a differential analysis based on wasp-12 twins will probably clarify if an atmospheric pollution is present , the nature of this pollution and its implications in the planet formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt also the direct detection of the circumstellar disk through infrared excess , but without success . </S>"
