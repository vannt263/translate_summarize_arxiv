    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data  @xcite have raised a number of interrogations concerning the statistical properties of the temperature field . while these data globally confirm the standard inflationary paradigm  @xcite and the concordance cosmological model , they exhibit some intriguing anomalies , particularly concerning the large angular scales . in particular , a huge activity has been devoted to the study of the low value of the quadrupole and octopole  @xcite as well as their alignment  @xcite , two effects that appear to be inconsistent with the standard cosmological model .    besides , many authors have tried to test the statistical properties of the temperature field using various methods . for instance",
    ", it was investigated whether the coefficients @xmath1 of the development of the temperature field on spherical harmonics were independent and gaussian distributed .",
    "while , as expected from the standard inflationary picture , a @xmath2 deviation from gaussianity seems to be well constrained  @xcite , there have been some claims that the distribution may not be isotropic  @xcite or gaussian  @xcite .",
    "no real physical understanding of these measurements have been proposed yet and the origin of these possible features is still unknown .",
    "some authors have argued in favor of systematic effects  @xcite while it was argue  @xcite that foreground contamination may play an important role in these conclusions .    from a theoretical point of view , there are many reasons to look for ( and/or constrain ) a departure from gaussianity and/or isotropy of the cmb temperature field .",
    "mode correlation can be linked to non - gaussianity , in particular due to finite size effects  @xcite or to the existence of some non - trivial topology of the universe  @xcite .",
    "while in the latter case , one expects to have a complex correlation matrix of the @xmath3 , the former leads generically to a dipolar modulation of the cmb field  @xcite .",
    "such a modulation induces in particular correlations between adjacent multipoles ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "similar correlations but with @xmath4 may also be induced by a primordial magnetic field  @xcite . in each case , the physical model and its predictions indicate the type of correlations to look for and will drive the design of an adapted estimator .",
    "investigation of the correlation properties of @xmath3 is thus important to correctly interpret previous observational results  @xcite .",
    "two approaches are thus possible .",
    "either one defines some general estimators and study whether they agree with a gaussian and isotropic distribution ( top - down approach ) or one sticks to a class of physical models and construct an adapted estimator ( bottom - up approach ) . in this article , we follow the second route and focus to the task of constraining a possible dipolar modulations of the cmb temperature field , that is correlations between multipoles with @xmath0 .    in section  [ sec_1bis ] , we start by some general considerations on the form of the correlation arising from a dipolar modulation .",
    "we then built an estimator , in section  [ sec_2 ] , adapted to these types of correlations .",
    "in particular , we can not use full - sky data and we will need to cut out some part of the sky .",
    "the effect of such a mask on the correlations will have to be taken into account and included in the construction of the estimator .",
    "we apply this estimator to the v and w bands of the wmap data in section  [ sec_3 ] .",
    "the v band exhibits an apparent detection .",
    "the interpretation of this result will require us to compare various masks , and in particular to investigate the effect of point sources on the signal to conclude that they are most likely its cause .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we focus on a possible dipolar modulation of the cmb signal .",
    "thus , we assume that the observed temperature field can be modelled as @xmath5\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the genuine statistically isotropic field and where @xmath7 are three unknown parameters that characterizes the direction of the modulation .",
    "the modulation has to be real so that @xmath8 is real and @xmath9 .    as usual",
    ", we decompose the temperature fluctuation in spherical harmonics as @xmath10 the coefficients @xmath3 are thus given by @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined and related in the same way . since @xmath6 is supposed to be the primordial , gaussian and statistically isotropic , temperature field , its correlation matrix reduces to @xmath14 a modulation of the form ( [ eq2 ] ) implies that the coefficients @xmath13 develop correlations between multipoles with @xmath0 . let us illustrate the origin of this correlation . from eqs .",

    "it follows that it will develop @xmath22 correlations that can be characterized by the two quantities @xmath23 which will be non zero respectively as soon as @xmath8 or @xmath24 are non zero . using the expression ( [ eq7 ] ) and the property ( [ eq8 ] ) of the primordial field",

    "this construction will be detailed in the following section .",
    "the previous analysis is illustrative but not suitable to be applied on real data . in particular these data will not be full sky and we have to take into account the effect of a mask ( see e.g. ref .",
    "such a mask , that arises in particular because of the galactic cut , will induce correlations in the coefficients @xmath13 that are described in ",

    "we design the mask in order to protect the correlations that originate from the modulation (   [ seca3 ] and   [ seca1 ] ) and finish by presenting the construction of our estimator in the most general case (   [ seca4 ] ) .",
    "the temperature field is observed only on a fraction of the sky .",
    "we thus have to mask part of the map so that the temperature field is in fact given by @xmath28   w({{\\vec\\gamma}})\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a window function , referred to as mask , indicating which part of the sky has been cut .",
    "we decompose @xmath29 in spherical harmonics as @xmath30 @xmath29 being a real valued function , it implies that @xmath31 . we deduce from eqs .",

    "the complications arise from the fact that @xmath33 does not satisfy the property ( [ eq8 ] ) because of the action ( [ eq23a ] ) of the kernel .      we now need to specify the form of the mask .",
    "first , let us note that when @xmath42constant for all @xmath43 then one trivially recovers that @xmath44 because @xmath45 so that @xmath46    since we are looking for @xmath22 correlations , we would like to design a mask that does not involve the same correlations for @xmath33 and that is not @xmath47-dependent . a solution is to impose that @xmath29 is a function of @xmath48 only and that it is north - south symmetric , that is @xmath49 since @xmath50",

    "we sum this measurement of two bands of @xmath59 ( respectively 20 - 100 and 100 - 300 ) and compare with 1000 simulated wmap data .",
    "we perform the same tests on the v band ( fig .  [",
    "fig : epsilon_v_35 ] and  [ fig : histo_v_20_100 ] ) .",
    "the apparent detection in the v band without clear counterpart in the w band suggest a non cosmological contamination . determining its origin requires to performed more tests",
    ".    this contamination can be a priori from two possible sources , galactic or extragalactic . to check",
    "if the correlations detected in the v band are of galactic origin , we apply the same estimator to the half sum and half difference of the v and w bands , that is @xmath107 and repeat the whole procedure on 1000 simulation in each case , where the simulations contain only cmb and noise according to the wmap specifications .",
    "the advantage of the half difference of the bands is that it should ( up to calibration errors ) eliminate the cmb signal completely at large scales , hence eliminate the main source of variance at these same scales , where the galactic signals are expected to dominate .",
    "indeed , the power spectra of galactic emissions usually scale as @xmath108 , with @xmath109 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the half sum results , summarized in table  i , are in between those of the v and w bands , which is coherent with the assumption of the detection being caused by a foreground source of electromagnetic spectrum different from the cmb fluctuations .    more importantly , the half difference results do not show a strong correlation detection at large angular scales , in contradiction with the assumption of the galactic foreground contamination being the source of the detected correlations in the v band .",
    "however , this half difference test does not work that well if the source contaminants are of extragalactic origin , since the power spectra of extragalactic foregrounds resemble that of the noise . in this case , the contamination is expected to increase with increasing multipole number , which seems to be the case for the v band ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : epsilon_v_35 ] and [ fig : histo_v_20_100 ] ) .",
    "the difficulty of extragalactic point sources contamination is that these sources ( quasars and active radio - galaxies ) are distributed more or less uniformly across the sky , which renders their masking by an azimuthally symmetric sky cut impossible .",
    "however , the wmap team provides with their data sets `` taylor cuts '' that blank out the resolved point sources of largest flux .",
    "of course , the dipolar modulation estimators designed in the preceding sections do not apply stricto sensu to these arbitrary masks , but one can hope , given the small fraction of sky removed at high latitude , that the broken symmetry of the mask will be a small perturbation in the computation of the @xmath24 s , so that the estimators keep their general validity , up to a possible small bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_wchange ] for a comparison of the coefficients @xmath58 of the two masks ) .",
    "this assumption can be checked on a simulated sky with a known dipolar modulation , where a wmap v - band noise is added to the signal , together with the taylor mask .",
    "we chose the most conservative mask provided by the wmap team ( kp0 ) , and applied it to a simulated sky of known modulation ( @xmath110 ) as described above , together with the v - band data .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig : epsilon_vkp0_35 ] and  [ kp0_histo ] .",
    "again , the estimators have been applied to @xmath105 simulations of the v band with no dipolar modulation , with the same kp0 mask applied , to estimate the statistics of the v - band data results .",
    "several observations can be made at this point .",
    "first , comparing these results with those obtained in the v - band , but with the azimuthally symmetric @xmath111 cut ( figure  [ fig : epsilon_v_35 ] ) , one can check that the estimators give very compatible results for the simulated dipolar modulation ( blue squares ) .",
    "this comforts our assumption that changing the cut sky to the kp0 mask is a small perturbation for the modulation estimators .",
    "secondly , comparing the same figures but this time looking at the data ( green squares ) , one can see that in the case of the @xmath111 cut there is a large trend at high @xmath59 s in @xmath112 that disappears when the kp0 cut is used .",
    "this is confirmed by the results of table  [ table : results ] where one can check that the tentative detections of in the v band using the simple cut become statistically insignificant when using the kp0 cut .",
    "in this article we have proposed an estimator designed to detect a possible modulation of the cmb temperature field , or equivalently @xmath0 correlations .",
    "the effects of cutting part of the sky were discussed in details and we applied this estimator to the v and w bands of the wmap data .    the results of our analysis are summarized in table  [ table : results ] which gives the amplitude of the modulation coefficients on the wmap data and a corresponding test case with @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "all values are given in standard deviation units , estimated on 1000 ( signal+noise ) simulations in each case , with no modulations .    while the v band seems to exhibit a marginal detection , further tests such as the study of the half sum and difference of the two bands and the effect of point sources",
    "have led us to conclude that this detection should be inferred to the effect of point sources contamination . in this analysis",
    "we have used the kp0 mask which does not satisfied the symmetries of the mask required for our estimator to be unbiased .",
    "nevertheless , our estimator seems to be well suited for the analysis , even with the kp0 mask .    to back up this interpretation we have performed two last tests .",
    "first we added to a simulated cmb map without modulation and with noise the 208 sources resolved by the wmap experiment and then smoothed with the correct beam .",
    "second we added to the same simulation the 700 circular region that are cut in the analysis of the v band in the wmap analysis . both simulations",
    ", while analyzed as the previous data with an azimuthal mask of 20 deg .",
    ", exhibit an excess of signal for @xmath8 and @xmath115 in the same range of multipoles than obtained on the analysis of the v and w bands ( figs .",
    "[ fres1 ] and  [ fig : epsilon_v_35 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the signal of @xmath116 is not affected and is identical to the one of figs .  [ fres1 ] and",
    "[ fig : epsilon_v_35 ] .",
    "indeed , the signals have not exactly the same amplitude as the ones obtained from the analysis of the v band but they exhibit the same trend on the the same scales .",
    "also , it has to be stressed that with a cut of 20 deg . the large magellannic cloud ( galactic latitude of 20 deg . and more and longitude of 0 deg . ) and",
    "a part of the h2 ophucius region should contribute and that we have not included them in the simulations .",
    "this could have enhance the signal .    in conclusion ,",
    "the set of analysis performed in our study tend to show that the @xmath0 correlations that appeared in the analysis of the v and w bands of the wmap data are due to foreground contaminations and most likely by point sources .",
    "the direction of the detected modulation will , in that interpretation , characterize the anisotropy of the distribution of these sources .",
    ".summary of the data analysis performed in this article .",
    "it concerns the two bands v and w , their half sum ( s ) and half difference ( d ) .",
