    "quantum optomechanics is a rapidly growing field which investigates the quantum aspects of the interaction between light and mechanical motion @xcite .",
    "the mechanical effects of light originate from the fact that light carries momentum which gives rise to radiation pressure forces , we mention for example the experimental spacecraft ikaros , whose flight is mainly powered by solar radiation pressure acting on a square solar sail with 20 @xmath0 diameter @xcite",
    ". the large size of the solar sail indicates a drawback of optical forces exerted on macroscopic objects : they are very weak . in order to bypass this problem , optical cavities , formed by one fixed and one movable mirror attached to a spring ,",
    "are used in the laboratory .",
    "the light trapped inside the cavity is resonantly amplified , enhancing thus the optical force acting on the movable mirror .    in the recent years",

    "promises the detection of tiny forces , masses , displacements and accelerations , close to the fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics . in the field of quantum information processing ,",
    "optomechanical devices can be used to convert solid - state  storage \" qubits into photonic  communication \" qubits , and also to create entanglement between macroscopic objects ( for example the movable mirror ) and the electromagnetic field in the cavity . from the last application it is also obvious that cavity optimechanics provides the ideal platform for tests of fundamental quantum physics in a macroscopic range of parameters like size and mass .    at the heart of these exotic applications",
    "lies the problem of cooling the mechanical resonator ( movable mirror ) to its ground state , so the full advantage of the quantum behavior is exploited @xcite .",
    "various techniques from quantum control @xcite have been suggested to overcome this challenge .",
    "measurement - based feedback was initially proposed @xcite and implemented experimentally @xcite , where the mirror displacement is continuously measured , using the phase shift that induces on the output radiation field , and the produced signal is fed back into the cavity to generate a damping force opposing mirror motion . around the same time",
    ", the use of kalman filter was introduced @xcite , to obtain a better estimate of the mirror position ; it was recently demonstrated in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "later , using the theoretical tools developed in @xcite , coherent feedback control was suggested , where the output field of the cavity is directed to another quantum system ( the controller ) and then is fed back to the cavity without measurement ; it was shown theoretically that this scheme can outperform measurement - based feedback , especially in the quantum regime @xcite . in parallel with the progress in feedback cooling , open - loop control , where the interaction between the cavity field and the mirror is modulated by a predetermined function of time ,",
    "was proposed as an alternative . in this",
    "context , numerical optimization methods @xcite and optimized lyapunov control @xcite were employed to obtain control pulses which can in theory provide efficient cooling in shorter times than feedback ( where cooling is achieved in steady state ) .",
    "the short cooling times are highly desirable to minimize the effect of the random interactions with the environment which  heat \" the mirror away from its ground state and towards thermal equilibrium .    following the framework of open - loop control and after a brief presentation of the underlying physics in the next section , we formulate in section [ sec : problem ] cavity optomechanical cooling as a minimum - time optimal control problem on anti - de sitter space of appropriate dimension .",
    "the bounded control used in this approach is the coupling rate which modulates the interaction between the cavity field and the mechanical resonator .",
    "we also find the target point for this control problem using an approximation of the original system . in section [ sec",
    ": solution ] we first show that the target point belongs indeed to the reachable set of the original system , and then use the legendre pseudospectral optimization method @xcite to find the minimum time and the corresponding optimal control to reach this point , for various values of the control bound . finally , in the concluding section [ sec : conclusion ]",
    ", we briefly discuss some further applications of the present work in quantum information processing and in the optimization of an optomechanical quantum heat engine .",
    "the system that we study in this paper consists of a mechanical resonator coupled to an optical resonator and is implemented experimentally with a laser driven optical cavity formed by two mirrors , one fixed and one movable which is attached to a spring @xcite .",
    "the light from the laser entering the cavity is reflected between the mirrors and the enhanced electromagnetic field built inside the cavity exerts a force to the movable mirror due to radiation pressure .",
    "the interaction between the cavity ( photon ) field and the mechanical vibration of the mirror ( phonon field ) can be described by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is planck s constant , @xmath3 is roughly the laser detuning from the cavity frequency and @xmath4 is the frequency of the mechanical resonator .",

    "the first two terms in ( [ hamiltonianfull ] ) express the energy of each individual oscillator ( optical and mechanical ) , while the last term the interaction between them .",
    "the coupling rate @xmath10 has dimensions of frequency and is the available control which can be altered with time , with the aim to cool the mechanical resonator . to obtain a better understanding of the interaction term , we recall that the creation and annihilation operators are related to the position operators @xmath11 of the two oscillators through the relations @xmath12 @xcite , thus the interaction is proportional to the product @xmath13 .",
    "this is reminiscent of two classical oscillators with displacements @xmath14 which interact through the usual quadratic term @xmath15 , from where the product @xmath16 arises .",
    "the state of the system can be described by the density matrix @xmath17 , which satisfies the liouville - von neumann equation @xcite @xmath18.\\ ] ] note that here we consider only the coherent evolution and ignore relaxation , which describes the undesirable interaction of the system with its environment , since we are interested in the fast pulsed cooling and not the steady state feedback cooling .",
    "this is a legitimate practice in minimum - time quantum control problems @xcite , the alternative being to include relaxation and maximize the fidelity of the final point @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the so - called  red - detuned regime \" @xmath19 where the two oscillators are on resonance .",

    "<S> optomechanical cooling is a prerequisite for many exotic applications promised by modern quantum technology and it is crucial to achieve it in short times , in order to minimize the undesirable effects of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate cavity optomechanical cooling as a minimum - time optimal control problem on anti - de sitter space of appropriate dimension and use the legendre pseudospectral optimization method to find the minimum time and the corresponding optimal control , for various values of the maximum coupling rate between the cavity field and the mechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the present framework can also be applied to create optomechanical entanglement in minimum time and to improve the efficiency of an optomechanical quantum heat engine .    </S>",
