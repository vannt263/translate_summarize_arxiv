    "the existence of quasi ",
    "fixed points is among the most spectacular and the most interesting properties of renormalization group equations .",
    "a feature characteristic to those solutions to renormalization group equations that approach such points is that a number of fundamental parameters of the theory are focused in a narrow interval in the infrared region .",
    "this means that , at the electroweak scale , some constants or their combinations cease to depend on the boundary conditions . that solutions to renormalization group equations behave in so peculiar a way in the vicinities of quasi ",
    "fixed points results in that the parameter space of the theory being considered is constrained for a wide class of such solutions . as a result , the predictive power of the theories being discussed becomes higher near these points .",
    "nonetheless , it turns out that , within the minimal standard model ( sm ) , the quasi ",
    "fixed point scenario leads to overly high a value for the mass of the @xmath5quark , which contradicts experimental data obtained at fnal .",
    "in contrast to the sm , its supersymmetric ( susy ) generalization  the minimal susy standard model ( mssm )  features two higgs doublets ( not one ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . upon a spontaneous breakdown of symmetry , they develop nonzero vacuum expectation values @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with the constraint @xmath10 being satisfied . in relation to what occurs in the sm ,",
    "the @xmath5quark running mass @xmath11 that is generated within susy models upon the breakdown of @xmath12 gauge symmetry involves an additional factor @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath5quark .",
    "since @xmath17 , @xmath18 is always less in the mssm than in the sm at the same values of the yukawa coupling constants .",
    "recent experimental data on the @xmath5quark mass make it possible to determine @xmath18 within the @xmath19 scheme @xcite .",
    "it proves to be @xmath20 .",
    "the uncertainty in the determination of the running mass of the @xmath5quark stems predominantly from the experimental error with which its pole mass was measured ( @xmath21 @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( [ 1 ] ) unambiguously relates @xmath22 to the value of the yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath5quark at the electroweak scale . at modest values of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , the yukawa coupling constants for the @xmath2quark , @xmath24 , and for the @xmath3lepton , @xmath25 , are negligibly small , which makes it possible to obtain an analytic solution to the renormalization group equation within the mssm @xcite . in this case",

    "the second term in parentheses is much less than unity for @xmath32 .",

    "this interesting property of the renormalization group equations within the mssm makes it possible to predict quite precisely the value of the yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath5quark at the scale @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gauge coupling constant for strong interaction and @xmath45 .",
    "the accuracy of this prediction becomes higher with increasing @xmath41 . at sufficiently large initial values of @xmath46",
    ", it would be illegitimate to restrict the analysis to one  loop renormalization group equations ",
    "it is necessary to take into account higher order perturbative corrections .",
    "moreover , the value of the yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath5quark at the electroweak scale depends on the strong interaction coupling constant , which we set to @xmath47 .",
    "nevertheless , all these uncertainties do not lead to significant deviation from ( [ 3 ] ) . by way of example , we indicate that the calculations that were performed in @xcite and which employed the four  loop beta function showed that deviations from ( [ 3 ] ) are within @xmath48",
    ".    for each fixed value of @xmath36 , the yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath5quark at the electroweak scale can be evaluated by using the exact analytic solution ( [ 2 ] ) , whereupon @xmath22 can be determined by substituting the resulting value of @xmath49 into ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical analysis performed in @xcite-@xcite revealed that , for the renormalization group equations within the mssm , a broad class of solutions corresponding to the infrared quasi ",
    "fixed point regime leads to @xmath22 values ranging between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . with increasing yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath5quark ,",
    "the corresponding trilinear coupling constant @xmath52 for the interaction of scalar particles and the combination @xmath53 of the scalar particle masses cease to depend on the initial conditions . in the vicinity of the quasi  fixed point ,",

    "fixed point regime at @xmath55 , the properties of solutions to the set of renormalization group equations and the spectrum of particles were investigated in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "finally , there is yet another circumstance that appears as an incentive to study the limit of strong yukawa coupling within the mssm .",
    "minimal schemes that are used to unify gauge interactions and which are based on gauge groups like @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 predict the equality of the yukawa coupling constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 for , respectively , the @xmath2quark and the @xmath3lepton at the scale @xmath54 @xcite . within the mssm , @xmath24 and @xmath25",

    "the spectrum of the higgs sector of the mssm contains four massive states : two cp  odd states , one cp  even state , and one charged state .",
    "the presence of a light higgs boson in the cp  even sector is an important feature of susy models .",
    "the upper limit on its mass greatly depends on @xmath22 .",
    "a reduction of the number of independent parameters in the infrared quasi ",
    "fixed point regime made it possible to determine , to a sufficiently high degree of precision , an upper limit on the mass of the lightest cp  even higgs boson . in the case",

    "this limit is @xmath63 lower than the absolute upper limit in the minimal susy model . at the same time",
    "the lower limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson from lepii data  in the case of a heavy spectrum of susy particles , it coincides with the corresponding limit on the higgs boson mass in the sm  is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "actually , this means that a major part of solutions approaching the infrared quasi  fixed point within the mssm have already been ruled out by the existing lepii data . in order to meet the experimental constraints on the mass of the lightest higgs boson ,",
    "it is necessary either to go over to studying solutions that lead to large values of @xmath22 within the mssm or to extend the higgs sector of the minimal susy model .",
    "the detailed investigations that were performed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite revealed that , at @xmath65 , solutions to the renormalization group equations also approach the infrared quasi  fixed point , the basic properties of the solutions remaining unchanged .",
    "the nonminimal susy sm ( nmssm ) @xcite-@xcite whose higgs sector contains , in addition to the doublets @xmath6 and @xmath7 , an extra superfield @xmath66 that is a singlet with respect to @xmath12 gauge interactions is the simplest extension of the mssm . in the parameter space of the nmssm , the region that corresponds to the limit of strong yukawa coupling , in which case the yukawa coupling constants @xmath67 at the grand unification scale @xmath54 are much greater than the gauge coupling constant @xmath68",
    ", is that which is the most appealing from the point of view of a theoretical analysis .",
    "it is the region where the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson takes a maximum value that is few gev greater than the corresponding absolute limit within the mssm @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible , in the case being considered , to choose coupling constants in such a way as to obtain the unification of the yukawa coupling constants for the @xmath2quark and the @xmath3lepton at the scale @xmath54 .    for the yukawa coupling constants in the limit of strong yukawa coupling , we study here basic properties of solutions to the renormalization group equations within the nmssm .",
    "we show that , in the limit @xmath0 , all solutions in the nonminimal susy model are concentrated , as in the mssm , near quasi ",
    "fixed points that arise as the result of intersections of hill lines or surfaces with some invariant line in the space of yukawa coordinates .",
    "however , the solution are rather weakly attracted to these points . for @xmath69 , all solutions to the renormalization group equations are therefore nonuniformly distributed near hill lines or surfaces .",
    "approximate solutions to the set of nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of @xmath70 within the nmssm are presented in the appendix .",
    "the approximate solutions that are obtained in the present study are compared with the results of numerical calculations within the nonminimal susy model .",
    "by construction , the superpotential of the nmssm is invariant under the discrete transformations @xmath71 of the @xmath72 group @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath73 in the superpotential of the nmssm does not satisfy this requirement .",
    "for this reason , an extra superfield @xmath66 that is a singlet with respect to @xmath12 gauge interactions is introduced in the nmssm .",
    "the superpotential of the higgs sector of the nmssm @xcite-@xcite has the form @xmath74 upon a spontaneous breakdown of @xmath12 symmetry , the field @xmath66 develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( @xmath75 ) and there arises an effective @xmath76term ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the introduction of the neutral field @xmath66 in the superpotential of the nmssm leads to the emergence of the corresponding @xmath78term in the potential of the interaction of higgs fields . as a result , the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson proves to be greater than in the mssm . specifically , we have @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 stand for , respectively , one  loop and two  loop corrections . at @xmath82 ,",
    "the expressions for the above upper limit within the mssm and the nmssm coincide . in the tree approximation ,",

    "the inclusion of loop corrections to the effective potential of higgs fields leads to a considerable growth of the upper limit on @xmath83 .",

    "the contribution of loop corrections to the upper limit on the higgs boson mass within the nmssm is approximately equal to that within the minimal susy model . in calculating the corrections @xmath80 and @xmath81 within the nmssm ,",
    "it is necessary , however , to replace the parameter @xmath76 by @xmath84 .",
    "one  loop and two  loop corrections within the mssm were studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in the leading approximation ,",
    "these corrections are proportional to @xmath85 ; they depend logarithmically on the scale of susy breaking , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the masses of the superpartners of the @xmath5quark ) , and are virtually independent on the choice of @xmath22 . the higgs sector in the nonminimal susy model and one  loop corrections to this sector",
    "were studied in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the possibility of a spontaneous cp  violation in the higgs sector of the nmssm was considered in @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson within the nmssm was compared with the corresponding limits within the minimal sm and minimal susy models .",
    "the most recent investigations revealed that , in the nonminimal susy model , @xmath83 does not exceed 135  gev @xcite .    from relation (",
    "[ 5 ] ) , it follows that the upper limit on @xmath83 grows with the increasing @xmath89 .",
    "it should be emphasised that only in the region of small @xmath22 is this limit markedly different from the corresponding limit within the mssm . at large values of this parameter ( @xmath90 ) ,",
    "the quantity @xmath91 vanishes , so that the upper limits on the mass of the lightest higgs boson within the mssm and the nmssm virtually coincide . but only in the case of sufficiently large @xmath49 is the scenario of small @xmath22 realised , @xmath22 becoming smaller with increasing @xmath49 , as can be seen from relation ( [ 1 ] ) . at the same time",
    ", an analysis of the renormalisation group equations within the mssm and the nmssm reveals that the growth of the yukawa coupling constants at the electroweak scale is accompanied by an increase in @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the grand unification scale .",
    "thus , it becomes clear that the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson within the nonminimal susy model attains a maximum value in the limit of strong yukawa coupling , in which case @xmath94 .    from the point of view of a renormalisation group analysis , investigation of the nmssm presents a much more complicated problem than investigation of the minimal susy model .",
    "the full set of renormalization group equations within the nmssm can be found in @xcite , @xcite . even in the one  loop approximation , this set of equations",
    "os nonlinear and its analytic solution does not exist .",
    "all equations forming this set can be partitioned into two groups , the first containing equations that describe the evolution of gauge and yukawa coupling constants . in analysing the nonlinear differential equations entering into this group ,",
    "it is convenient to go over from @xmath16 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 to the quantities @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , which are defined as the ratios of the squares of the corresponding yukawa coupling constants and the gauge coupling constant for strong interaction , @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the one  loop renormalisation group equations for @xmath105 have the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "the second group includes equations for the parameters of a soft breakdown of susy , which are necessary for obtaining a phenomenologically acceptable spectrum of superpartners of observable particles . since boundary conditions for three yukawa coupling constants are unknown , it is very difficult to perform a numerical analysis of the equations belonging to the first group and of the full set of the equations given above . in the regime of strong yukawa coupling ,",
    "however , solutions to the renormalisation group equations are concentrated in a narrow region of the parameter space near the electroweak scale , and this considerably simplifies the analysis of the set of equations being considered .",
    "let us first consider the simplest case of @xmath111 . the growth of the yukawa coupling constant @xmath89 at a fixed value of @xmath49 results in that the landau pole in solutions to the renormalization group equations approaches the grand unification scale from above . at a specific value @xmath112 ,",
    "perturbation theory at @xmath113 cease to be applicable .",
    "with increasing ( decreasing ) yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath2quark , @xmath114 decreases ( increases ) . in the @xmath115 plane , the dependence @xmath116 is represented by a curve bounding the region of admissible values of the parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 . at @xmath119 , this curve intersects the abscissa at the point @xmath120 .",
    "this is the way in which there arises , in the @xmath115 plane , the quasi  fixed ( or hill ) line near which solutions to the renormalization group equations for the initial values of the yukawa coupling constants in the range @xmath121 are grouped ( see figs .",
    "1a , 1b ) . with increasing @xmath122 and @xmath41 , the region where the solutions in questions are concentrated sharply shrinks . at initial values of the yukawa coupling constants from the range between @xmath123 and @xmath124",
    ", they are grouped in a narrow region near the straight line @xmath125 which can be obtained by fitting the results of numerical calculations ( these results are presented in figs . 2a and 2b ) .",
    "moreover , it follows from the data in the table that the combination @xmath126 of the yukawa coupling constants depends much more weakly on @xmath122 and @xmath41 than @xmath127 and @xmath128 individually . in other words ,",
    "a decrease in @xmath127 compensates for an increase in @xmath128 , and vice versa . to illustrate this ,",
    "we indicate that , at initial values @xmath122 and @xmath41 from the interval @xmath129 , the following occurs upon an increase in @xmath122 and a decrease in @xmath41 : the constant @xmath127 increases monotonically from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , while @xmath128 decreases from @xmath132 to @xmath133 ; at the same time , the sum @xmath126 at identical @xmath122 and @xmath41 ranges between @xmath134 and @xmath135 . the results in figs .",
    "3a and 3b , which illustrate the evolution of the above combinations of the yukawa coupling constants , also confirm that this combination is virtually independent of the initial conditions .    in analysing the results of numerical calculations ,",
    "our attention is engaged by a pronounced nonuniformity in the distribution of solutions to the renormalization group equations along the infrared quasi  fixed line .",
    "the main reason for this is that , in the regime of strong yukawa coupling , the solutions in question are attracted not only to the quasi  fixed but also to the infrared fixed ( or invariant ) line .",
    "the latter connects two fixed points . of these , one is an infrared fixed point of the set of renormalization group equations within the nmssm ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) @xcite , while the other fixed point @xmath140 corresponds to values of the yukawa coupling constants in the region @xmath141 , in which case the gauge coupling constants on the right  hand sides of the renormalization group equations can be disregarded @xcite .",
    "the infrared fixed line is invariant under renormalization group transformations  that is , it is independent of the scale at which the boundary values @xmath36 and @xmath142 are specified and of the boundary values themselves . if the boundary conditions are such that @xmath36 and @xmath142 belong to the fixed line , the evolution of the yukawa coupling constants proceeds further along this line toward the infrared fixed point of the set of renormalization group equations within the nmssm . with increasing @xmath5 , all other solutions to the renormalization group equations",
    "are attracted to the infrared fixed line and , for @xmath143 , approach the stable infrared fixed point . from the data in figs .",

    "<S> the considerable part of the parameter space in the mssm corresponding to the infrared quasi fixed point scenario is almost excluded by lepii bounds on the lightest higgs boson mass . in the nmssm the mass of the lightest higgs boson reaches its maximum value in the strong yukawa coupling limit when yukawa couplings are essentially larger than gauge ones at the grand unification scale . in this limit the solutions of the renormalisation group equations are attracted to the infrared and hill type effective fixed lines or surfaces in the yukawa coupling parameter space . they are concentrated in the vicinity of quasi fixed points for @xmath0 . </S>",
