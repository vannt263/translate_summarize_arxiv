    "this paper deals with the isoperimetric problem in @xmath0 with density .",
    "more precisely , we consider a given l.s.c .",
    "function @xmath3 ( the `` density '' ) and we define the weighted volume and perimeter of a set @xmath4 as @xmath5 where for every set @xmath6 of locally finite perimeter we denote as usual by @xmath7 its reduced boundary , while @xmath8 for every set which is not locally of finite perimeter ( the basic properties of sets of finite perimeter will be briefly recalled in section  [ sec : finper ] ) .",
    "the _ isoperimetric problem _ , then , consists in searching for sets of minimal ( weighted ) perimeter among those of fixed ( weighted ) volume .",
    "the study of the isoperimetric problem in @xmath0 with density has been deeply studied in last years , also because of its close connection with the isoperimetric problems on riemannian manifolds ( a short and incomplete list is  @xcite ) .",
    "the three main questions which one wants to understand are usually the existence , the boundedness , and the regularity of isoperimetric sets ( only in very specific examples one can try to determine explicitely the minimizers ) . concerning the boundedness , it is to be pointed out that it is not only interesting by itself , but it is also important when proving the existence ( roughly speaking , when trying to show the existence of an isoperimetric set for volume @xmath9 , it is useful to know that there do not exist unbounded isoperimetric sets for volumes less than @xmath9 )",
    ".    we will be able to give some new results concerning all the three questions ; in particular , we will find a sharp boundedness theorem ( theorem  [ obvious ] ) .",
    "one important tool in many of the works on isoperimetric problems is a classical `` @xmath1 '' property already discussed by allard , by almgren , and by bombieri since the 1970 s ( see for instance  @xcite ) ; this property basically means that a certain set can be locally modified in order to increase its volume by @xmath10 , while the perimeter increases at most by @xmath11 ( we leave the formal definitions to section  [ preliminaries ] ) .",
    "this property is trivial to establish if the density and the set are supposed to be regular enough , but its validity is also known if the set is even just of locally finite perimeter and the density is only lipschitz continuous ( see  @xcite ) ; on the other hand , it is very easy to observe that the validity may fail as soon as the density is not lipschitz .",
    "this is more or less the reason why most of the different boundedness and regularity results in this context use at least a lipschitz assumption on the density .    in this paper",
    ", we start from the following observation .",
    "it is classical and very easy to prove that , if an isoperimetric set fulfills the @xmath1 property , then it must be bounded ; but in fact , to get its boundedness , a weaker property is really needed , namely , the `` @xmath2 '' property , which states that it is possible to increase its volume by @xmath10 and its perimeter at most by @xmath12 , for some @xmath13 ( this is the content of our theorem  ) .",
    "then , our main result implies that the @xmath14 property is always true for any set of locally finite perimeter whenever the density is continuous .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath15 there exists some @xmath16 , with @xmath17 such that , if the density is @xmath18 , then the @xmath2 property holds ( this will be proved in theorem  ) .",
    "putting together the two results , the following consequence will be immediate ( the meaning of `` essentially bounded '' density is clarified in definition  [ essbdd ] , anyway any density which is bounded from above and below is essentially bounded ) .",
    "[ obvious ] assume that @xmath19 is continuous and essentially bounded",
    ". then every isoperimetric set is bounded .",
    "we underline that this result is sharp .",
    "in fact , many examples ( see for instance those in  @xcite ) show the existence of unbounded isoperimetric sets for densities which are unbounded from above or from below ; and on the other hand , in section  [ example ] we are able to build the example of an unbounded isoperimetric set for a density which is bounded both from above and from below but not continuous .",
    "as we said above , theorem  [ obvious ] is stronger than the previously known results , which all needed at least a lipschitz assumption .",
    "more precisely , to give a comparison , we just recall the following very recent boundedness result .",
    "let @xmath6 be an isoperimetric set in @xmath0 with a @xmath20 density @xmath19 .",
    "then e is bounded if any of the following three hypotheses hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath19 is increasing , or 2 .",
    "@xmath19 is radial and increasing , or 3 .",
    "@xmath22 .",
    "let us now briefly pass to describe our contributions to the questions of the existence and regularity of isoperimetric sets , which come as applications of theorems   and  . concerning the existence , we will only recall that some existence results available in the literature require , as an _ a priori _ assumption , the boundedness of the isoperimetric sets . since all these results concern densities which are essentially bounded and continuous , the boundedness assumption can be removed , because it now directly follows from theorem  [ obvious ] .    concerning the regularity , instead",
    ", we will recall some very classical results , and we check their consequences in view of the @xmath2 property that we have established . the theorem that we obtain ,",
    "theorem  [ regu ] , says that if the density @xmath19 is essentially @xmath18 then any isoperimetric set is of class @xmath23 .",
    "stronger regularity results are contained in the forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "observe that , as usual , results on @xmath0 with density admit counterparts in the context of riemannian manifolds ; however , we do not study the extension here ( for an overview of the known results in this direction , see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ preliminaries ]",
    "we give all the formal definitions and the claims of our main results , while in section  [ sec : finper ] we recall some basic properties of the sets of finite perimeter",
    ". then , in sections  [ bounded ] and  [ holder ] we give the proof of theorems   and  . later on , in section  [ example ] we give the example of a situation where an isoperimetric set is unbounded , while the density is essentially bounded but not continuous .",
    "finally , in section  [ applications ] we discuss the questions of the existence and regularity of isoperimetric sets .",
    "this section is devoted to present the relevant definitions that we will need during the paper , and to claim our main results .",
    "we consider a given l.s.c .",
    "function @xmath24 $ ] , such that the points @xmath25 for which @xmath26 or @xmath27 are locally finite , and we work with the weighted notion of volume and perimeter given by  ( [ defweight ] )",
    ". for brevity we will denote @xmath28 for any @xmath29 , so that definition   can be rewritten as @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; given an open set @xmath32 , we will denote the relative perimeter of @xmath6 in @xmath33 as @xmath34 . sometimes we will need to consider the euclidean volume , or perimeter , or relative perimeter , of a set @xmath6 , which will be denoted by @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 respectively ( while we will not use the notation @xmath38 or @xmath39 to avoid ambiguity ) .",
    "we will always call @xmath40 the open ball centered at the origin and with radius @xmath41 , and @xmath42 the ball centered at @xmath25 and with radius @xmath41 .",
    "the next definition is sometimes useful .",
    "for every set @xmath4 , we define the _ spherical rearrangement _ @xmath43 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the unique function such that for every @xmath46 one has @xmath47    the definition of spherical rearrangement is not so much useful for a generic density @xmath19 , but it becomes very important when @xmath19 is radial , thanks to the following result , whose proof can be found for instance in  @xcite or  @xcite .",
    "[ sphsym ] assume that @xmath19 is radial and @xmath4 .",
    "then , one has @xmath48",
    "let us give now the particular definitions that we will use in this paper .",
    "[ defepepbe ] let @xmath49 be a set of locally finite perimeter , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "we say that _ @xmath6 fulfills the @xmath2 property with constant @xmath52 _ if there exist a ball @xmath53 and a constant @xmath54 such that , for every @xmath55 , there is a set @xmath56 such that @xmath57    we give also the following simple definition , which will only be used within the subsequent definition  [ essbdd ] .",
    "a family @xmath58 of open subsets of @xmath0 is said _ well - decreasing _ if one has that @xmath59 is bounded for every @xmath60 , and for any measurable set @xmath61 of finite perimeter one has @xmath62 for some arbitrarily small @xmath63 .",
    "notice that , for instance , the sets @xmath64 form a well - decreasing family ; more in general , for a family of open sets with @xmath59 bounded , to be well - decreasing it is enough that @xmath65 .    in the paper , we will always assume one of the following hypotheses on @xmath19 .",
    "[ essbdd ] the l.s.c .",
    "function @xmath3 is said to be _ essentially bounded _ if there exist a well - decreasing family @xmath66 and constants @xmath67 such that @xmath68 for every @xmath69 .",
    "analogously , @xmath19 is said to be _ essentially @xmath70-hlder _ for some @xmath71 if @xmath19 is essentially bounded , and there exist a well - decreasing family @xmath66 and constants @xmath67 such that @xmath72 for every @xmath73 .",
    "observe that @xmath19 is essentially @xmath70-hlder with @xmath74 if and only if it is essentially bounded .",
    "notice that , clearly , if @xmath19 is bounded by above and below then it is also essentially bounded , and similarly if it is @xmath70-hlder continuous then it is also essentially @xmath70-hlder , hence we could have simply restricted our attention to standard bounded or hlder densities .",
    "nevertheless , we prefer to use the above slightly more complicate definitions for two reasons .",
    "first of all , this allows to consider also the typical class of examples where the density may vanish of explode at the origin , such as @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "second , as one can see later , this choice does not effect at all any of the proofs , so we can obtain slightly stronger results for free .",
    "another comment deserves to be done concerning the choice of considering only densities which are ( at least in the essential sense ) bounded both from above and from below .",
    "in fact , this is unavoidable , since many examples ( see for instance those in  @xcite ) enlighten that both existence and boundedness can easily fail otherwise , thus no general result can be obtained without this assumption .",
    "we are now in position to claim our two main theorems .",
    "notice that , in the above theorem , we do not need any continuity assumption on @xmath19 : the sole @xmath2 property together with the essential boundedness of @xmath19 is enough to ensure the boundedness of any isoperimetric set @xmath6 .",
    "notice that , once @xmath77 is fixed , @xmath78 is a continuous and strictly increasing function of @xmath70 with @xmath79 for @xmath74 , and @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and moreover @xmath82 for every @xmath83 .",
    "notice also that theorem  [ obvious ] is an immediate consequence of the two above theorems .",
    "it is essential to underline a very delicate point in the claim of theorem  , namely , that in the case when @xmath19 is just essentially bounded and continuous , the @xmath2 property with @xmath79 holds true _ for every constant @xmath51 _ ( of course , when @xmath52 becomes smaller , so does the constant @xmath84 in definition  [ defepepbe ] ) .",
    "this is of primary importance : in fact , as the proof of theorem   will enlighten , when a set fulfills the @xmath2 property with some @xmath85 , then the constant @xmath52 is unessential ; on the other hand , if @xmath79 , then it is fundamental that the constant @xmath52 can be chosen arbitrarily small . and",
    "indeed , if @xmath19 is essentially bounded but not continuous then the @xmath14 property holds true , but not with any constant @xmath52 , and hence one can not apply theorem   and in fact an isoperimetric set can be unbounded , as we will show with the example in section  [ example ] .",
    "since a basic knowledge of the theory of sets of finite perimeter is needed for the proof of our results , we recall here very briefly what we are going to use . for a general tractation of this subject , and for the proof of all the claims of this section , the interested reader should refer for instance to  @xcite .",
    "let then @xmath4 be a set of locally finite volume .",
    "we say that @xmath6 is _ of locally finite perimeter _ if the characteristic function @xmath86 of @xmath6 is a @xmath87 function .",
    "in other words , we require @xmath88 to be a vector valued and locally finite radon measure . if @xmath6 is a set of locally finite perimeter , one defines the _ reduced boundary _",
    "@xmath7 of @xmath6 as the set of all those points @xmath89 such that there exists a ( necessarily unique ) vector @xmath90 with the property that @xmath91 the vector @xmath92 is called the _ ( measure theoretical ) outer normal of @xmath6 at @xmath25_.    one can prove that @xmath93 coincides with the vector valued measure @xmath94 ; finally , one says that the ( euclidean ) perimeter of @xmath6 is defined as @xmath95 it is easy to show that , if the set @xmath6 is regular enough , then this general notion of perimeter coincides with the usual perimeter , the reduced boundary coincides with the usual topological boundary , and the measure theoretical outer normal coincides with the usual outer normal .",
    "however , there exist sets of finite perimeter for which the topological boundary and the reduced boundary do not coincide ; for instance , the set of the points in @xmath0 with rational coordinates has an empty reduced boundary and so null perimeter , but its topological boundary is the whole @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude by recalling three classical results , that we will use extensively in the sequel .",
    "[ blowupthm ] let @xmath4 and @xmath96 .",
    "for every @xmath97 , define the blow - up set @xmath98 , and call @xmath99 and @xmath100 . then , when @xmath101 , one has that the sets @xmath102 converge to @xmath103 in the @xmath104 sense , while the measures @xmath105 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath106 ) weak * converge to the measure @xmath107 ( resp . , @xmath108 ) .",
    "to state the following result , the volpert theorem , we need a simple preliminary piece of notation .",
    "let @xmath4 be a borel set .",
    "we define the _ vertical section _ of @xmath6 at any level @xmath109 , and the _ horizontal section _ of @xmath6 at any level @xmath110 as @xmath111    [ volpert ] let @xmath6 be a set of locally finite perimeter . then , for @xmath112-a.e .",
    "@xmath113 the vertical section @xmath114 is a set of finite perimeter in @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "analogously , for @xmath117-a.e .",
    "@xmath118 the horizontal section @xmath119 is a set of finite perimeter in @xmath120 , and @xmath121 up to an @xmath122-negligible set .",
    "the proof of this result can be found in  @xcite for the case of the vertical sections , while the analogous for the horizontal sections ( or in general , for sections of any codimension ) is proved in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be a set of locally finite perimeter and denote , for @xmath123 , the outer normal of @xmath6 at @xmath25 as @xmath124 .",
    "for every borel function @xmath125 it is @xmath126 and analogously @xmath127",
    "this section is entirely devoted to give a proof of theorem  .",
    "let @xmath6 be an isoperimetric set .",
    "since @xmath19 is essentially bounded , we can take some @xmath128 and @xmath129 such that @xmath130 outside @xmath131 .",
    "let us now use the assumption that @xmath6 fulfills the @xmath2 property , finding constants @xmath132 with @xmath133 such that , for every @xmath134 , there exists a set @xmath135 with @xmath136 outside the ball @xmath137 , and @xmath138 let us now define , for every @xmath139 , @xmath140 the function @xmath141 is decreasing and goes to @xmath142 as @xmath41 goes to @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , observe that @xmath144 hence @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "pick now any @xmath147 : we can consider a competitor @xmath148 by cutting away the part of @xmath6 which is outside the ball @xmath40 , and then using the @xmath2 property to recover the correct volume without increasing too much the perimeter .",
    "more precisely , first of all we notice that @xmath149 then , we apply the standard euclidean isoperimetric inequality and the bounds on @xmath19 to get @xmath150 which inserted into  ( [ starthere ] ) gives @xmath151 we apply now  ( [ tkxepseps ] ) with @xmath152 to find a set @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "since @xmath135 coincides with @xmath6 outside @xmath137 and @xmath156 , we can finally define the competitor @xmath148 as @xmath157 . by construction",
    "we find @xmath158 while by  ( [ continue ] ) it is also @xmath159 since @xmath6 is an isoperimetric set and @xmath148 has the same volume as @xmath6 , we derive that for every @xmath160 it must be @xmath161 , which implies @xmath162 we claim then what follows : there exist two positive constants @xmath163 and @xmath164 such that @xmath165 it is immediate to prove the validity of this estimate by considering separately the case @xmath79 and the case @xmath85 . indeed , in the first case  ( [ basic ] ) is just an immediate consequence of  ( [ prebasic ] ) and of the choice  ( [ onlyforb=1/2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath85 , then @xmath166 when @xmath10 is small enough , then  ( [ basic ] ) readily follows by  ( [ prebasic ] ) .",
    "since @xmath141 is a continuous and decreasing function , we can select @xmath167 such that @xmath168 for every @xmath169 .",
    "let us now directly show the boundedness of @xmath6 : if @xmath170 , then there is nothing to prove ; otherwise , let @xmath171 be such that @xmath172 , and for every @xmath173 let @xmath174 be such that @xmath175 . then , recalling  ( [ basic ] ) and the fact that @xmath176 , for every @xmath173 we can evaluate @xmath177 from which we deduce that @xmath178 this immediately implies that , for every @xmath179 , @xmath180 and in turn this implies that @xmath181 for every @xmath182 , that is , @xmath183 is bounded .",
    "in this section we give the proof of our main result , theorem  .",
    "since the proof is quite involved , we have divided it for simplicity in three parts and several steps .",
    "let us consider a function @xmath19 as in the claim , and an isoperimetric set @xmath6 .",
    "in the first part , we will show that the @xmath184 property holds . since @xmath185 unless @xmath186 ,",
    "the property is in fact weaker than what we need ; nevertheless , we prefer to start with this somehow easier case , because the proof of the stronger @xmath2 property , which will be done in the second part , will be a careful modification of the same argument . and",
    "in turn , also the case when @xmath19 is only essentially continuous will eventually be treated , in the third part , with the same strategy . by definition  [ essbdd ]",
    ", there exists an open set @xmath187 with @xmath188 and such that , for a suitable @xmath129 , one has @xmath189 be a point in @xmath190 .",
    "we can assume for simplicity that @xmath191 coincides with the origin in @xmath0 , and that the outer normal of @xmath6 at @xmath191 is the vertical direction @xmath192 .",
    "we start considering the case when @xmath19 is essentially @xmath70-hlder , and prove the @xmath184 property ; the proof is divided in many steps .    in this first step , we will select a suitably small constant @xmath193 , and from now on we will restrict our attention to the cube @xmath194 , which is entirely contained inside @xmath195 as soon as @xmath196 . let us denote by @xmath197 the horizontal cube , and by @xmath198 the constant vector field @xmath199 ; let moreover @xmath200 be a sufficiently small constant , that will be precised later .",
    "we aim to choose @xmath201 such that @xmath202 is contained in the open set @xmath195 defined above , and moreover all the following properties hold : @xmath203 we show now that such a choice of @xmath193 is possible .",
    "indeed , the first five conditions   are true for _ every _ @xmath193 small enough , say @xmath204 , as a direct consequence of the blow - up theorem  [ blowupthm ] .",
    "it remains then only to show that there exists _ some _ @xmath204 satisfying also condition  ( [ bordo ] ) . to do so observe that , also by  ( [ p2 ] ) and  ( [ p3 ] ) , @xmath205 therefore , there exists @xmath206 for which @xmath207 notice that , thanks to volpert theorem , without loss of generality we can assume @xmath208 we have then found some @xmath204 for which also  ( [ bordo ] ) holds true .",
    "this concludes the first step .    in this step",
    ", we subdivide the horizontal cube @xmath209 into four sets @xmath33 , @xmath53 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , depending on the properties of @xmath212 . since in the whole proof we are concentrated only on what happens inside @xmath202 , we will always consider the horizontal and vertical sections inside the cube , even without specifying it ; in other words , we will write @xmath114 or @xmath119 ( respectively @xmath213 or @xmath214 ) instead of @xmath215 or @xmath216 ( respectively @xmath217 or @xmath218 ) .",
    "this is a slight abuse of notation , but it will simplify a lot the formulas in the rest of the proof .",
    "the sets are the following @xmath219 let us briefly discuss the meaning of these sets : thanks to step  ( i ) , we can imagine @xmath220 to be close to the half - cube @xmath221 , thus we expect the vertical sections @xmath222 to be close to @xmath223 .",
    "the `` good '' set @xmath210 is precisely the set of those @xmath224 for which this holds , namely , @xmath222 is a `` lower '' segment starting at @xmath225 and ending between @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "all the other @xmath224 are then contained in the `` bad '' sets @xmath33 , @xmath53 and @xmath211 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath33 collects those @xmath228 for which volpert theorem does not hold true ( keep in mind that we know by theorem  [ volpert ] that @xmath33 is @xmath112 negligible , but this does not imply that the sections corresponding to @xmath33 do not carry perimeter ! ) .",
    "instead , @xmath53 is the set of the sections which have no boundary , thus are either the full segment @xmath229 , or they are empty .",
    "finally , @xmath211 is the set of the sections having some boundary , but not contained in @xmath210 .",
    "observe that this can happen for several different reasons : if @xmath230 contains exactly one point , then either this point is not between @xmath226 and @xmath231 , or @xmath222 is an `` upper '' segment starting between @xmath226 and @xmath231 , and ending at @xmath232 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath230 has more than one point , then the points can be finitely many or infinitely many .",
    "we further subdivide @xmath211 in four subsets according to the above possibilities , namely , we define @xmath233 the aim of this step is to show that @xmath210 fills a big portion of @xmath209 , and that the perimeter of @xmath6 in the sections not belonging to @xmath210 is extremely small .",
    "let us start by observing that , thanks to  , one has @xmath234 we have now to estimate each of the terms in the right - hand side of last inequality .",
    "first , since by construction @xmath235 on the set @xmath236 , we have @xmath237 we address now the integral on @xmath238 .",
    "recall that , as already observed , if @xmath239 and @xmath240 , then @xmath241 .",

    "then , since for any @xmath247 it is clearly @xmath248 by sending @xmath249 we derive @xmath250 thanks to   and  , the coarea formula ( theorem  [ coarea ] ) directly gives @xmath251 we address now @xmath252 .",
    "recall that , by definition , if @xmath253 then @xmath254 with @xmath255 .",
    "call then @xmath256 the set of those @xmath257 for which @xmath258 , that is , the levels @xmath228 such that the outer normal at @xmath259 is _ not _ horizontal .",
    "we remark the well known fact that @xmath260 . using again the coarea formula , denoting by @xmath261 the dirac mass at @xmath262 we find @xmath263",
    "hence we have @xmath264 note that the `` @xmath265 '' sign comes from that fact that @xmath266 has clearly a negative last component for every @xmath267 .",
    "the very same argument used for @xmath252 can be repeated for @xmath210 , recalling that for every @xmath268 one has that @xmath269 with some @xmath270 . therefore ,",
    "since @xmath271 has a positive last component , in place of   we find now @xmath272 finally , we address @xmath273 .",
    "first of all , recall that @xmath274 for almost every @xmath275 .",
    "thus @xmath276 moreover , by definition , for every @xmath277 there exist @xmath278 and @xmath279 , for @xmath280 , such that @xmath281 .",
    "let us call again @xmath282 the set of those @xmath228 for which all the corresponding @xmath283 have a non - horizontal outer normal , where again @xmath284 .",
    "using the coarea formula exactly as we did for @xmath252 and @xmath210 , we have that @xmath285 where @xmath286 therefore we have , analogously as in   or  , @xmath287 recall that , in the last expression , the integer @xmath288 and the points @xmath283 depend on @xmath228 .",
    "observe now that , in the right hand side of last equation , the integrand is always a finite sum of @xmath289 ; let us discuss carefully the signs . for @xmath290 , we have that @xmath291 is a finite union of segments . moreover , by construction @xmath292 , since we are working within the open cube @xmath202 .",

    "this is exactly what we are going to prove , but some care is required since , in passing from @xmath6 to @xmath135 , we could also lose some volume , basically for two reasons .",

    "this will be the only point in this part where we are going to use the @xmath70-hlder assumption on @xmath19 .",
    "we start pointing out that the change in perimeter has four contributions .",

    "hence , we call @xmath379 being @xmath380 the projection on the last variable",
    ". the last contribution comes from the fact that , since we are slightly moving @xmath381 between the levels @xmath324 and @xmath312 , we have to take into account that the density is changing .",
    "we set then finally @xmath382 by construction , we can write @xmath383 thus , since the sets @xmath384 are @xmath112-essentially pairwise disjoint , and so are also @xmath376 and @xmath385 , one can estimate @xmath386 we now estimate the terms in the right hand side of the above inequality one by one : while the first two terms ( @xmath387 for @xmath388 ) are small by the sole essential boundedness of @xmath19 , to show that the last two terms ( @xmath389 for @xmath390 ) are small one needs to use the essential @xmath70-hlder assumption on @xmath19 .",

    "since the projection @xmath394 is @xmath301-lipschitz and @xmath19 is @xmath70-hlder on @xmath202 , we have by  ( [ pv+ ] ) and recalling that @xmath329 that @xmath395 finally , using again the @xmath70-hlder property , we can compare @xmath396 and @xmath385 as follows @xmath397 plugging  , , and   into  , and recalling that @xmath398 and @xmath63 are as small as we desire , we conclude @xmath399    we can now conclude very quickly the @xmath184 property . indeed ,",

    "then , observe that the volume of the set @xmath330 is a continuous function of @xmath401 : thus , thanks to  ( [ lowest ] ) and  ( [ uppest ] ) , there exists some admissible @xmath63 for which @xmath402 .",
    "in particular , @xmath63 satisfies @xmath403 therefore , ( [ perest ] ) immediately implies @xmath404 .",
    "to finish the proof of the @xmath184 property , we have to consider the case when @xmath405 and @xmath406 . to do so , still assuming for simplicity that the origin of @xmath0 belongs to @xmath407 and the outer normal of @xmath6 at the origin is the vertical direction , we define @xmath408 .",

    "we will again split the proof in some steps .",

    "what we want to do , is to show the validity of the same property with _ any _ arbitrarily small constant .",

    "our strategy will be to slightly modify the definition of @xmath527 in order to decrease as desired the first two terms ; unfortunately , while doing so the last two terms will correspondingly increase .",

    "let us be more precise : we fix a small number @xmath528 and we aim to show the @xmath14 property with constant @xmath529 .",
    "to do so , we recall the construction and the estimates of step  ii with @xmath530 , which corresponds to the case @xmath74 .",

    "we have then established the validity of  ( [ toget ] ) , thus it is definitively proved that @xmath53 is the ( unique ) isoperimetric set of volume @xmath557 , as desired .",

    "more refined new results concerning the regularity in the @xmath630-dimensional case are contained in the forthcoming paper  @xcite .",

    "of course , in all these results the boundedness assumption can be removed whenever it comes directly from theorem  .",

    "let @xmath19 be a continuous density on @xmath0 approaching a finite limit @xmath201 at infinity .",
    "then there exist isoperimetric sets of all volumes if one of the properties  ( i),(ii ) , or  ( iii ) of theorem  [ above ] holds true .",
    "we pass now to the regularity issue .",
    "to start , we recall what is known up to now concerning the regularity of isoperimetric sets in @xmath0 with density ( see for instance  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3.5 and corollary  3.8 ) ) .",
    "[ strongregu ] let @xmath19 be a smooth or @xmath638 density on @xmath639 , with @xmath640 .",

    "notice that , as we already explained in the introduction , the known result covers only cases in which the density is at least lipschitz , while there are no results for lower regularity of the density .",
    "our theorems , instead , allow to obtain some regularity results for the isoperimetric sets even with just bounded densities .",
    "what we will do here , in fact , is just to put together our theorem   and the well - known regularity theory in the standard euclidean setting .",
    "to do so , let us first briefly recall a couple of important notions of minimality for the perimeter and the corresponding regularity properties ( whose proofs can be found for instance in  @xcite , see also  @xcite ) ; then , we will derive the regularity results for our setting .",
    "let @xmath4 be a set of locally finite perimeter .",
    "we say that @xmath6 is _ quasi - minimal _ if , for some @xmath51 and for every ball @xmath643 , @xmath644 moreover , we say that @xmath6 is _ @xmath539-minimal _ , for some continuous and increasing function @xmath645 with @xmath646 , if , for every ball @xmath643 and every set @xmath135 such that @xmath647 , one has @xmath648    let @xmath6 be a borel subset of @xmath0 .",

    "[ omega - regu ] if a set @xmath6 is quasi - minimal , then it is porous and the reduced and the topological boundaries coincide ( @xmath112-a.e . ) . moreover , if @xmath6 is @xmath539-minimal with @xmath654 for some @xmath655 , then @xmath656 is @xmath657 .",
    "we will see that an isoperimetric set is always quasi - minimal if the density is even just bounded from above and below , hence the porosity holds true in all these cases .",
    "instead , the @xmath539-minimality holds true as soon as @xmath19 is hlder continuous , thus in these more particular cases we will get also some further regularity .",
    "more precisely , we obtain the following result .",
    "[ regu ] let @xmath6 be an isoperimetric set corresponding to the density @xmath19 . if @xmath19 is bounded from above and below , then @xmath6 is porous and @xmath658 . if moreover @xmath19 is @xmath70-hlder , then one has also that @xmath659 .",
    "we point out that the regularity given by the above theorem is surely not optimal . indeed ,",
    "in the forthcoming paper  @xcite we will improve the above regularity result by showing that , in dimension @xmath21 , if @xmath660 then the boundary of any isoperimetric set is of class @xmath661 , while theorem  [ regu ] gives only @xmath662 .    before giving the proof of theorem  [ regu ] , a couple of remarks is in order .",
    "we have claimed the regularity theorem under the assumption that the density is bounded , or hlder , instead of essentially bounded or essentially hlder , just for simplicity of notations .",
    "however , it is very easy to deduce the general claim .",
    "in fact , assume that @xmath19 is essentially bounded , or essentially @xmath70-hlder , and let @xmath663 be the open sets as in definition  [ essbdd ] .",
    "then , just arguing inside each open set @xmath663 , in the essentially bounded case we derive that an isoperimetric set @xmath6 satisfies the porosity property on each @xmath663 , and that @xmath664 on @xmath665 .",
    "similarly , in the essentially @xmath70-hlder case , we deduce that @xmath666 is of class @xmath667 .",
    "one could try to obtain some regularity for the isoperimetric sets also starting from other standard regularity results ( whose proofs can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , a set @xmath6 is of class @xmath668 if it has the uniform interior and exterior ball property .",
    "recall that @xmath6 is said to satisfy the _ interior ( resp . ,",
    "exterior ) ball property _ if there is @xmath669 such that , for every @xmath670 , there exists a ball @xmath671 contained in @xmath6 ( resp . , in @xmath672 ) such that @xmath673 .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is even of class @xmath674 for every @xmath675 ( and even @xmath676 if @xmath21 ) if it is _",
    "@xmath677-minimal _ , that is , there exists @xmath678 such that for every set @xmath135 one has @xmath679 .",
    "but unfortunately , both these conditions seem to become useful only when @xmath19 is at least lipschitz ( while we are interested in the lower regularity case )",
    ". to be more precise , concerning the interior - exterior ball property one can easily observe that , if @xmath19 is not lipschitz , it is not even true that an arc of circle of small radius is longer than the corresponding chord . and concerning the @xmath677-minimality , one can not hope to have it if @xmath19 is @xmath70-hlder and @xmath680 , as one can derive arguing as in the proof of theorem  [ regu ] below , and as one can also guess because otherwise the regularity result ( @xmath19 of class @xmath18 would imply any isoperimetric set of class @xmath681 ) would be excessively strong .",
    "we are now ready to conclude the paper with the proof of the regularity theorem  [ regu ] .    keeping in mind theorem  [ omega - regu ] ,",
    "we are reduced to check that an isoperimetric set @xmath6 is quasi - minimal if @xmath19 is bounded from above and below , while @xmath6 is @xmath682-minimal with @xmath683 if @xmath19 is also @xmath70-hlder .",
    "let us start by assuming that @xmath684 , and suppose by contradiction that an isoperimetric set @xmath6 is not quasi - minimal .",
    "hence , for any large constant @xmath685 there exists a ball @xmath643 such that @xmath686 let then @xmath643 be any such ball , and define the set @xmath687 : provided that @xmath685 is very large , we deduce @xmath688 thanks to theorem  , we know that @xmath135 fulfills the @xmath689 property with some constant @xmath52 , thus there exists a further set @xmath148 satisfying @xmath690 and with @xmath691 where we are assuming again @xmath685 to be large enough .",
    "since this inequality is against the isoperimetric property of @xmath6 , the contradiction shows the quasi - minimality of @xmath6 .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath19 is also @xmath70-hlder and @xmath6 is an isoperimetric set : to conclude the proof , we need to show that @xmath6 is @xmath682-minimal with @xmath692 and some suitable @xmath693 .",
    "to do so , we pick @xmath655 and we investigate whether , for some suitable constant @xmath52 , @xmath6 is @xmath539-minimal with @xmath694 ( eventually , we will find that the best choice is @xmath695 ) .",
    "therefore we suppose that , for any large constant @xmath685 , there exist a ball @xmath643 and a set @xmath135 with @xmath696 , such that @xmath697 by the first part of the proof we know that @xmath6 is quasi - minimal , thus @xmath698 , and by  ( [ contr - omega - min ] ) it is then also @xmath699 . let us assume , just for simplicity of notations , that @xmath700 ; hence , since @xmath19 is @xmath70-hlder , it is @xmath701 , so that @xmath702 recalling  , we deduce @xmath703 applying now theorem  , we can define a competitor set @xmath148 with @xmath704 combining this estimate with  , we get @xmath705 since by the definition   of @xmath78 one immediately checks that @xmath706 for any @xmath707 $ ] , we have a contradiction with the optimality of @xmath6 with the choice of a sufficiently large @xmath685 as soon as @xmath708 , that is , @xmath709 . summarizing , we have shown the @xmath682-minimality of @xmath6 and hence the proof is concluded .",
