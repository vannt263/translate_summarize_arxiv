    "[ delta ] shows the mass distributions of @xmath3 resonances at rest in asymmetric nuclear matter as functions of mass .",
    "one sees that they are similar to that in free space ( solid line ) as a result of the cancelation between the pion in - medium effects , which enhance the strength at low masses , and the pauli - blocking of the nucleon from delta decay , which reduces the strength at low masses .",
    "this is consistent with the observed similar energy dependence of the photo - proton and photo - nucleus absorption cross sections around the @xmath3 resonance mass  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the strength around the peak and near the threshold of the @xmath3 resonance mass distribution slightly decreases with increasing charge of the @xmath3 resonance due to nonzero isospin asymmetry of the nuclear medium .",
    "to see the above isospin - dependent pion in - medium effects on the @xmath83 ratio in heavy ion collisions , we have used a thermal model which assumes that pions are in thermal equilibrium with nucleons and @xmath3 resonances  @xcite . in terms of the spectral function @xmath84 , the density of a particle species @xmath85",

    "the @xmath5 in the fermi - dirac distribution for @xmath3 resonances is then simply @xmath94 . for nucleons , their spectral functions are taken to be delta functions if we neglect the imaginary part of their self - energies , i.e. , @xmath95    according to studies based on the transport model  @xcite , the total number of pions and @xmath3 resonances in heavy ion collisions reaches a maximum value when the colliding matter achieves the maximum density , and remains essentially constant during the expansion of the matter . for au+au collisions at the beam energy of @xmath79 , for which the @xmath83 ratio has been measured by the fopi collaboration at gsi  @xcite , the ibuu transport model gives a maximum density that is about twice the normal nuclear matter density and is insensitive to the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy , as it is mainly determined by the isoscalar part of the nuclear equation of state  @xcite .",
    "this density is thus used in the thermal model .",
    "the temperature in the thermal model is determined by fitting the measured pion to nucleon ratio , which is about @xmath96 including pions and nucleons from the decay of @xmath3 resonances  @xcite , without medium effects and with unity fugacity parameters for all particles , and the value is @xmath97  mev . the assumption that pions and @xmath3 resonances are in chemical equilibrium is consistent with the short chemical equilibration times estimated from the pion and @xmath3 resonance production rates .",
    "the isospin asymmetry of the hadronic matter is then taken to be @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , corresponding to net charge densities of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , for the three symmetry energies given by @xmath40 , @xmath104 , and @xmath93 , respectively , in order to reproduce the @xmath83 ratios of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 predicted by the ibuu transport model of ref .  @xcite using corresponding symmetry energy parameters without pion in - medium effects . since the medium effects enhance the pion and @xmath3 resonance densities , to maintain the same pion to nucleon ratio as the measured one requires the fugacity parameters for pions and @xmath3 resonances to be less than one .",
    "also , the pion in - medium effects have been shown to affect only slightly the pion and the @xmath3 resonance abundance  @xcite , indicating that both pions and @xmath3 resonances are out of chemical equilibrium with nucleons when medium effects are included , as expected from the estimated increasing pion and @xmath3 resonance chemical equilibration times as a result of the medium effects .",
    "because of the small number of pions ( about 0.3% ) and @xmath3 resonances ( about 1.1% ) in the matter , the density , temperature , and net charge density of the hadronic matter are expected to remain unchanged when the pion in - medium effects are introduced .",
    "they lead to , however , a slight reduction of the isospin asymmetry to @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 for the three symmetry energies , respectively .",
    "we note that with the fugacity of nucleons kept at @xmath111 , the fugacity parameters of about @xmath112 and @xmath113 are needed to maintain same total number of pions and @xmath3 resonances as in the case without pion in - medium effects , and that the required values for the fugacity parameters increase only slightly for the other two symmetry energies considered here .",
