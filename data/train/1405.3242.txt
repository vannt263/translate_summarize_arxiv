    "there is much discussion in the literature about using resonant structure in debris disks as an indirect way to find planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in debris disks ,",
    "the observable is dust grains , which is used to infer the presence of a collisionally - grinding planetesimal belt @xcite . in our own solar system , the opposite is true : we can directly observe orbits of the planets and planetesimals to great precision , while no direct observations exist of dust in the kuiper belt .",
    "we also know that the kuiper belt has significant resonant structure @xcite , which requires that neptune s orbit has migrated outwards .",
    "this migration may have happened smoothly as neptune scattered planetesimals inwards onto jupiter - crossing orbits , `` snowplowing '' objects into mean - motion resonances along the way @xcite , or neptune may have been scattered outward by a close encounter with one of the other giant planets , and trapped planetesimals in mean - motion resonances as its eccentric orbit damped to near - circular ( the  nice model  ; * ? ? ?",
    "the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ) was a large survey carried out with the megacam instrument on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) between 20032007 , with the goal of discovering many trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) and using the known sky coverage , obervation depths , and tracking fractions in different observing blocks at many points along the ecliptic plane to debias the observations and regain the true orbital distribution of the kuiper belt .",
    "the observing strategy for cfeps is described in detail in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "a patch of sky is observed three times in a night , with each observation separated by about one hour .",
    "these triplets of images are searched for moving objects , and preliminary orbits are calculated .",
    "one month later , followup images are taken of the same field , and the same objects are recovered .",
    "this is repeated each month for 45 months .",
    "this 45 month baseline is used to predict object positions one year later , and the objects are recovered again , further improving the calculated orbits .",
    "a 10  myr - long orbital integration is performed using the orbital elements and position of each tno , and including the gravitational effects of the four giant planets .",
    "the tnos are then placed into dynamical classes following the procedure outlined by @xcite .",
    "the classes are resonant ( tnos in mean - motion resonances with neptune ) , scattering ( tnos that closely encounter neptune within 10  myr ) , detached ( tnos that currently do not dynamically interact with neptune ) , and classical ( tnos on low-@xmath1 , low-@xmath2 orbits with @xmath3 within a few au of neptune ) .",
    "cfeps detected 176 tnos .",
    "their orbital element distributions are shown in the left panel of figure  [ debiasing ] .    , @xmath1,@xmath2 ) of tnos discovered by cfeps , and right panel shows debiased tno orbital element distributions , where the relative numbers in each population and in each resonance are correct .",
    "objects have symbols according to dynamical class ( see key ) , and mean - motion resonance positions are indicated by dotted lines.,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath1,@xmath2 ) of tnos discovered by cfeps , and right panel shows debiased tno orbital element distributions , where the relative numbers in each population and in each resonance are correct .",
    "objects have symbols according to dynamical class ( see key ) , and mean - motion resonance positions are indicated by dotted lines.,title=\"fig : \" ]    because the survey is well - characterized , it can be debiased to reproduce not only the orbital elements of each different dynamical class , but also the absolute populations .",
    "we will use the plutinos ( objects in the 3:2 mean - motion resonance ) as an example to explain the debiasing process ( figure  [ cumuplots ] ) .",
    "first , we choose parameters to model the distribution of synthetic plutinos in eccentricity , inclination , libration amplitude , and size distribution ( shown in black in figure  [ cumuplots ] ) , which is discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this synthetic distribution is run through the cfeps survey simulator , where each object is evaluated to determine if it would have been detected by cfeps .",
    "synthetic detections are shown in blue in figure  [ cumuplots ] .",
    "the cumulative distributions of five parameters of the synthetic detections are compared statistically to the cumulative distributions of the real cfeps detections . any modeled distribution where the bootstrapped comparison statistic for any of the five distributions occurs @xmath45% of the time",
    "is considered rejected . in this way",
    ", we get very powerful constraints on the orbital element distributions and the size distribution , and we can use this to calculate absolute population .    this modelling process is repeated for each resonance @xcite and other kuiper belt components individually @xcite .     magnitude .",
    "black ( in both panels ) shows synthetic non - detections , blue circles / solid lines show synthetic detections by the survey simulator , and red squares shows real detections .",
    "also shown in the left panel are the cfeps observing blocks , with the relative magnitude limits indicated by the outer edge of each wedge ( showing the distance limit where a @xmath5100  km diameter object would still be detected).,title=\"fig : \" ]   magnitude .",

    "many very detailed models of the dust produced by the kuiper belt exist in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model presented here is only meant to serve as a demonstration of how the cfeps debiased kuiper belt distribution ( available for download at ` www.cfeps.net ` ) can be used as a starting point for a kuiper belt dust simulation .    figure  [ nums ] shows contour plots of the number density of the debiased resonant ( right panels ) and non - resonant tnos ( left panels ) . applying a simple dust flux model , where each tno is replaced by a modified - blackbody dust grain , the resonant structure is completely drowned out by the much higher number density of classical objects .",
    "the kuiper belt has been sculpted by giant planet migration , and contains many populated resonances ( 20% of @xmath0100  km objects are resonant ) , but this is difficult , if not impossible , to see in the overall disk structure as seen from afar .",
    "currently , no theoretical giant planet migration models can reproduce all the structure that is observed in the kuiper belt @xcite . because of the completely unknown biases that are present in the minor planet center database , the cfeps debiased kuiper belt distribution is currently the most accurate model for tnos @xmath0100  km in diameter , and makes an excellent starting point for collisional dynamical kuiper belt dust models ."

    "<S> because a large fraction of known debris disks are consistent with dust at kuiper belt distances from the host stars , the cfeps kuiper belt model provides an excellent starting point for a debris disk model , as the dynamical interactions with planets interior to the disk are well - understood and can be precisely modelled using orbital integrations . </S>"
