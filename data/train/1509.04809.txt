    "although they did find a hump in two dimensional harmonically trapped bose system but this hump was below the classical limit . in this case , @xmath91 @xmath92 , no hump over the classical limit .",
    "therefore , it can be said that the theorem 4.1 can perfectly determine whether the humps will be below or above the classical limit .",
    "+   +    now figure 2 illustrates @xmath3 of bose system with different trapping potentials .",
    "it is seen from the figure that , @xmath3 is continuous when @xmath93 and it becomes discontinuous when @xmath94 , in agreement with theorem 4.2 .",
    "now , as @xmath95 denotes a hump in @xmath86 over its classical limit , this automatically depicts discontinuity in @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the appearance of a hump in @xmath86 over its classical limit does indicate a discontinuity in @xmath3 but a discontinuity in @xmath3 does not conclude the appearance of a hump in @xmath86 over its classical limit because discontinuity in @xmath3 may arise even if @xmath96 but no hump in @xmath4 will exist in this interval of @xmath43 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath97 will denote a discontinuity in @xmath3 as well as the appearance of a hump in @xmath86 over its classical limit ( see table 2 ) .",
    "in this manuscript we have restricted our study in the case of ideal quantum gases trapped under generic power law potential and proved the bmb conjecture for these types of systems .",
    "point to note , as no hump in @xmath4 or no discontinuity in @xmath3 is noticed in ideal fermi gases for any trapping potential .",
    "so , the theorems and the concluding relation between energy fluctuation and @xmath3 remain significant for ideal bose systems only .",
    "it will be interesting so see the status of the above theorem for interacting quantum systems . also it will be very intriguing to generalize the theorems for relativistic quantum gases .",
