    "the theoretical particle physics has succeeded in explaining the physics of the elementary particles based on the quantum mechanism and its extension to the relativistic field theory .",
    "it reached to the so - called standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics , which contains the @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2@xmath1@xmath3 gauge groups coupled to fundamental particles i.e. three generations of the quarks , leptons and higgs scalar .",
    "although the sm can explain a lot of independent high energy experimental data , it may not be accepted as the fundamental physics of the world .",
    "this is because there are many free parameters which we only fix posteriorly by the experiments , that is , the matter fields with three replica and the masses of the matters in each of generations and mixing in the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "that is the so - called flavor problem .",
    "indeed , most of free parameters in the sm are originated from the flavor sector , that is , yukawa couplings .",
    "in addition , the reason why the strong interactions do not break cp but weak interactions do is not explained .",
    "these issues are accomplished by one specific choice of the infinite classes of possible quantum filed theory of the sm . beyond these issues , there are more intrinsic problems in the sm .",
    "we refer to the naturalness problems of higgs scalar and quantum field theory of the gravity .",
    "the former problem is related to the quantum corrections to the higgs scalar mass and may be solved by introducing the supersymmetry .",
    "the supersymmetric quantum field theory may become the extention of the sm . in its minimal extension  ( mssm )",
    ", it has a superpartner for each of elementary particles with different spin - statistics .",
    "the corresponding scalar partners of quarks and leptons are squarks and sleptons and the higgs scalar also has the partner i.e. higgisino and gauge boson has its fermionic partner as a gaugino",
    ". however the latter issue still remains .",
    "the superstring theory successfully unifies the concepts of quantum field theory and general relativity .",
    "this is the most promising approach to overcome these issues . in order to claim that it incorporates a unification of all forces observed in nature",
    ", one has to prove the existence of string models reproducing sm particle physics . the best way to prove its existence consists in the construction of explicit models since that allows also to investigate phenomenological implications of string theory .",
    "perhaps the most traditional , attempt of identifying realistic string models is given by heterotic orbifold constructions  @xcite . in more recent years , this line of research was boosted by the observation that phenomenological properties can be connected to geometrical properties of the orbifold @xcite .",
    "examples for quantities which are directly tied to geometry are the khler potential for twisted sector states as well as yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "( for interesting applications see e.g.  ref .",
    "the calabi - yau compactifications are also interesting as compactified six dimensional spaces preserving @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "the background metric is non - trivial and there are many kinds of six dimensional calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "the concrete models for heterotic orbifold can be regarded as the singular limit of the smooth calabi - yau compactifiactions . in a parallel development , semi",
    "realistic models have been obtained in the free fermionic formulation of heterotic strings @xcite .",
    "although there are some indications @xcite that these models are related to @xmath5 orbifolds a precise connection has not been worked out in general .",
    "hence a geometric picture is missing for many free fermionic models .",
    "the possibilities of the model building from type ii string theory have been enriched by the discovory of the d - branes  @xcite .",
    "the open strings have their end points on certain d - branes .",
    "their lowest modes give rise to massless gauge fields and their fermionic partners .",
    "then n - stack of the d - branes have naturally @xmath6 number of massless gauge bosons and they have @xmath7 gauge symmetry in low - energy .",
    "it is shown that these d - brane backgrounds give rise to realistic string compatifications . the first attempt to obtain the chiral matter fields",
    "is considered by two d - branes which are intersected each others .",
    "the chiral matter fields can appear in their localized intersecting points as bi - fundamental gauge representaions .",
    "the number of zero - modes i.e. the generation number is given by the intersection number in internal spaces .",
    "this model contruction has an advantage that the geometrical interpretation is easy as well as heterotic orbifold models .",
    "the specific examples for this type of models are discussed in type iia string models with d6-branes  @xcite .",
    "their t - dual models i.e. magnetized d - brane models also have been investigated . in the language of t - duality ,",
    "the intersecting angle of two d - branes in the type  iia side is interpreted as the magnetic flux inside two internal spaces in the type  iib picture .",
    "there is no localized mode in the internal spaces and their low - energy effective theory can be discrebed higher dimensional super yang - mills theory with magnetic flux .",
    "the background magnetic fluxes cause a breaking of gauge groups and chiral matter fields can be obtained by solving the zero - mode solutions . from the t - dual of @xmath8 toroidal compactification of intersecting d6-brane models ,",
    "corresponding chiral matter fields are calculated explicitly from a simple factorizable @xmath9 toroidal compactifications with constant magnetic flux .",
    "the resulting solutions are represented by the products of jacobi theta functions .",
    "the bosonic mode , for example higgs scalar or scalar partners , are also calculated by solving laplace operator with flux background .",
    "these results can be applied for lower dimensions @xmath10 and lead to various types of models .",
    "concerning about the flavor problems explained above , one has to know yukawa couplings . in the string theory computation ,",
    "yukawa couplings are calculated by string amplitude of corresponding three vertex operators by using cft technique .",
    "taking into accout the classical contributions of the amplitude , yukawa couplings are represented by a sum over worldsheet instanton effects .",
    "the magnitude of the yukawa couplings is affected by the localization points for three matter fields . when their localization points are far away each other , the exponetially surppressed yukawa couplings are obtained .",
    "thus yukawa couplings are geometrically determined . on the other hand , in the t - dual picture , the calculations of the yukawa couplings are purely field theoretical .",
    "yukawa interactions can be calculated by overlap integrals over internal spaces with three wavefunctions as the following forms @xmath11 where @xmath12 correspond to the internal wavefunctions of chiral matter fields and @xmath13 is the internal wavefunctions of higgs scalar fields .",
    "the explicit calculations of the overlap integrals can tell us the form of the yukawa couplings .",
    "it is found that two different approaches of stringy and field theory calculations lead to the consistent results of the yukawa couplings after proper transformation of moduli parameters  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the method using the field theoretical approach can tell us the other constants like the normalization constants or higher order couplings .",
    "for example , the former contribution is related to the kahler moduli . in order to obtain those in the intersecting d - brane side ,",
    "it needs quantum effects of stringy correlators .",
    "these results are also consistent each other up to higher order corrections to the normalization factors .",
    "a rather bottom - up approach to understand the realistic quark / lepton mass hierarchy and mixing angles is the flavor symmetry .",
    "symmetries play an important role in particle physics .",
    "as long time ago it was suggested that the @xmath3 symmetries can be applied to obtain the hierarchical quark mass structure as called by froggatt - nielsen mechanism  @xcite .",
    "more recently non - abelian discrete symmetries are investigated to address the above flavor issue in particular in explanation of the large mixing of lepton flavor .",
    "it is plausible that such non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries are originated from extra dimensional theories , because non - abelian symmetries are symmetries of geometrical solids .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that certain types of non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 can appear in four - dimensional effective field theories derived from heterotic string theory with orbifold background  @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) in those analyses , the important ingredients to derive the non - abelian discrete flavor symmetry are geometrical symmetries of the compact space and stringy coupling selection rules . to investigate the flavor symmetry , it is important to investigate the higher order couplings . in the field theoretical approach ,",
    "the higher order couplings are also calculable in principle . for toroidal compactification @xmath16 case ,",
    "the generic n - point couplings are also represented analytically and have same properties as cft calculations . the main ingredient is stressed that the generic n - point couplings are given by the products of three point couplings .",
    "then one can analyze the flavor symmetries and find that there are several types of discrete flavor symmetries in the model with magnetized / intersecting d - brane models and a certain relation between the number of generations and the flavor symmetries .",
    "although in the normalization factor there is a small discrepancy in the stringy and field theoretical calculations , this does not affect in the structures of the flavor since it is only determined by the number of generations i.e. the index number .",
    "therefore it would be helpful to understand the flavor symmetries for considering the flavor problems .",
    "recently the wavefunction profiles have been studied in some of non - trivial background geometry , e.g. orbifold compactifications , @xmath17 , @xmath18 geometry  @xcite , warped compactifications  @xcite and flux compactifications  @xcite in which it is succeeded to obtain the explicit solutions of wavefunctions .",
    "such string constructions are classified to two classes of global and local models .",
    "as mentioned above , the ten - dimensional compactification is naturally corresponding to the low - energy limit of the heterotic and type i string theory .",
    "from the view point of the field theory , one may consider less than ten dimensional field theory with gauge interactions .",
    "global models are defined in the total compact space with certain choice of topological features .",
    "the simplest example is the heterotic string theory with calabi - yau compactifications . on the other hand ,",
    "local models can be considered localized modes living in a part of extra dimensions .",
    "the gauge and matter fields depend on the local internal spaces and do not depend on the details of other bulk topological features .",
    "thus there are attractive features of local model construction which drastically simplify the structures of the geometry and it is easier to calculate the low - energy physics than that of global models . indeed in the general calabi - yau compactifications ,",
    "explicit metric of such a global compact space is not known .",
    "for example we can consider the possibility of the singular point in the six dimensional compact space with orbifold and then such a metric can be represented as @xmath19 @xmath1 @xmath20 .",
    "one may put the @xmath21 stack of d@xmath22-brane wrapping the @xmath19 on the singular point of @xmath23 orbifold .",
    "thus the low - energy effective theory is described by @xmath4 @xmath24 super yang - mills theory with proper gauge groups . in both cases",
    ", one can apply the formula of the overlap integrals and the method of kluza - klein decomposition .",
    "thus the field theoretical approach is powerful method to calculate the low - energy constant including proper stringy effects and moduli fields dependence , which allow to construct the phenomenologically interesting models .",
    "in addition , these constructions are also related to the phenomenological model building within the extra dimensions .",
    "suppose that the chiral matter fields have gaussian profiles in the extra dimensions and each of generations is localized in different way , the hierarchical structures of the masses for generations may be obtained .",
    "therefore one sees that d - brane model constructions give some of concrete examples for these phenomenological models .",
    "we then study these features of extra dimensional field theory for the case of exceptional gauge groups e.g.@xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 which are regarded as phenomenological model buildings .    in recent years",
    "a renewal of the local model building has been developing , for instance , f - theory model buildings  @xcite . in f - theory models",
    ", it naturally includes exceptional gauge groups beyond the type  iib d - brane .",
    "the flavor structures are different from that of d - branes models , there are a lot of development for phenomenological studies .    for the selection of the vacua , one should study the potential of the moduli field and supersymmetric four dimensional vacua . in the string theory",
    ", there are many fields beyond the sm particle .",
    "some of them are called as moduli fields and their vacuum expectation values correspond to the size or shape of the compactification spaces and positions of d - brane and so on .",
    "these values are also related to the parameters like gauge coupling constant or masses for four dimensional fields . in the general calabi - yau compactifications ,",
    "these moduli are not determined by means of minimalizing the potential of moduli . to solve this problem ,",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed  @xcite . in the string theory , they contain the anti - symmetric tensor fields as @xmath28 .",
    "their field strengths are also appearing as @xmath29 and have non - vanishing background expectation values so called three form flux .",
    "this flux affects in the low - energy potential in the moduli sectors .",
    "thus some of these moduli fields are stabilized in a flux compactification . furthermore in type",
    "iib theory , kahler moduli @xmath30 are stabilized by non - perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation . in the supergravity potential , this minimum is supersymmetric and anti - de sitter vacuum .",
    "the anti - d3 brane is introduced in order to uplift the vacuum energy and realize the de sitter or minkowski vacuum .",
    "this shifts the position of the potential minimum and breaks the supersymmetry in a controllable way .",
    "this is so called kklt scenario  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a new calculable method of moduli stabilization was proposed , using the internal magnetic fields .",
    "this method can be used in simple toroidal compactifications , stabilizing the geometric moduli in a supersymmetric vacuum that is within a perturbative string description . once",
    "if we have a mechanism to break low - energy supersymmetry , the relevant soft supersymmetry breaking terms are also related to the magnetic flux .",
    "thus these approaches using the magnetic flux or kklt scenario can obtain the moduli parameters in a certain level so that we can analyze the low - energy spectrum including the super particle .",
    "discrete symmetries play an important role in model building of particle physics . for example ,",
    "abelian and non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries are useful to derive realistic quark / lepton masses and their mixing  @xcite .",
    "discrete non - abelian flavor symmetries can also be used to suppress flavor changing neutral current processes in supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , discrete symmetries can be introduced to forbid unfavorable couplings such as those leading to fast proton decay @xcite .",
    "it is widely assumed that superstring theory leads to anomaly - free effective theories .",
    "in fact the anomalous @xmath3 symmetries are restored by the green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism @xcite . for this mechanism to work ,",
    "the mixed anomalies between the anomalous @xmath3 and other continuous gauge symmetries have to satisfy a certain set of conditions , the gs conditions , at the field theory level .",
    "in particular , in heterotic string theory the mixed anomalies between the anomalous @xmath3 symmetries and other continuous gauge symmetries must be universal for different gauge groups up to their kac - moody levels @xcite .",
    "a well - known discrete symmetry in heterotic string theory is t - duality symmetry , and its effective theory has t - duality anomalies @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the mixed anomalies between t - duality symmetry and continuous gauge symmetries are universal except for the sector containing an @xmath31 subsector and are exactly canceled by the gs mechanism @xcite .",
    "that has phenomenologically interesting consequences which have been studied in early 90 s @xcite .    for the above purposes , in this thesis , we study the phenomenological aspects of the higher dimensional super yang - mills theory with various dimensions as the best motivated theory for effective field theory of string theory and study the low - energy physics related to the extension of the sm . the contents of this thesis are as follows .",
    "in section 2 we first study the higher dimensional @xmath32 super yang - mills theory on the torus background with magnetic fluxes using the usual kluza - klein dimensional reductions for obtaining the chiral matter fields .",
    "we also solve the wavefunctions explicitly in the toroidal compactifications with and without toron configurations of twisted boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "we see the mechanism for obtaining the chiral fermion and the number of generations .",
    "furthermore we extend this analysis to the exceptional gauge groups in a similar way  @xcite . in section 3",
    "we consider about calculation of the three point couplings which can appear in the off - diagonal components for different three gauge groups  @xcite .",
    "these analysis can extend to the generic n - point couplings in which we see the structures of the n - point couplings are related to the product of three point couplings  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss about the t - dual picture , i.e. results from intersecting d - brane model .    in section 4",
    "we analyze the flavor structures based on the field theoretical approach .",
    "then we show that the discrete flavor symmetries can appear in these types of models  @xcite , which are phenomenologically interesting for the realistic patterns of the lepton mixings .",
    "the corresponding representations for each generation are classified .",
    "the role of the wilson line parameters in flavor symmetry are shown and its phenomenological implications with symmetry breaking are also discussed .    in section 5 we study the orbifold compactifications with magnetic background  @xcite .",
    "we will see that a possible orbifold projection on @xmath16 is restricted only @xmath33 orbifold .",
    "therefore the remaining matter field after orbifold projections are consist of either even or odd wave functions .",
    "they are obtained from linear combination of the wavefunctions on the torus .",
    "the zero - mode spectra are different from that of toroidal compactifications .",
    "we classify the phenomenologically interesting models with three generations of chiral matters and analyze the yukawa couplings .",
    "we also discuss the phenomenological model building with magnetized extra - dimensions .",
    "the question is whether discrete anomalous symmetries can appear in string - derived models .",
    "the discrete symmetries on orbifolds reflect certain geometrical symmetries of internal space .",
    "since the geometrical operations are embedded into the gauge group , one might suspect that the discrete anomalies are related to gauge anomalies .",
    "in section 6 we use path integral methods to derive the anomaly of discrete symmetries including non - abelian discrete symmetries and show the anomaly coefficient for mixed gauge or gravitational anomaly .",
    "we also briefly review the discrete anomalies focusing on the discrete flavor symmetries appearing in heterotic orbifold models and higher dimensional field theory .",
    "next , we define discrete @xmath34-charges , which is defined in heterotic orbifold models and calculate the mixed anomalies between the discrete @xmath34-symmetries and the continuous gauge symmetries in concrete models .",
    "we also study the relations of r - anomalies with one - loop beta - function coefficients and t - duality anomalies .",
    "phenomenological implications of our results are also discussed .",
    "finally section 7 is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in order to obtain the low - energy lagrangian , we specify the functions of kahler potential and super potential . in appendix",
    "a we perform the kaluza - klein reductions of ten dimensional super yang - mills theory and give a procedure for obtaining the scalar component of the chiral matter field and calculation of the kahler potential . for toroidal compactifications the moduli dependence for yukawa and kahler potential",
    "is obtained . in appendix",
    "b , c , we classify the orbifold models with three generation and show the results of yukawa couplings . in appendix d ,",
    "we give a short introduction of the properties of discrete symmetries used in the thesis .",
    "understanding the structure of the sm is one of the fundamental problems of theoretical particle physics .",
    "in particular , one of most outstanding puzzles of the sm of particle physics is the structure of the yukawa couplings between the higgs field and the sm fermions .",
    "a correct description of the observed masses and mixing of quarks and leptons seems to require very different values for the yukawa coupling constants for the different generations .    in recent years",
    "the idea that there could be more than four dimensions has been pursued intensively , particularly due to the study of string theory which is naturally defined in 10 or 11 dimensions . in fact extra dimensional field theories , in particular string - derived extra dimensional field theories , play an important role in particle physics as well as cosmology .",
    "there is a possibility of computing the yukawa coupling in terms of the extra - dimensional geography . starting from d+4 dimensional compactified theory",
    "one may obtain the massless modes with factorized wavefunctions .",
    "gauge bosons in the extra dimensional component become scalars at low - energy and its fermionic component may give rise to the matters .",
    "yukawa couplings can appear from the higher dimensional gauge interactions @xmath35 .",
    "yukawa coupling constant is calculated in principle from the overlap integrals over extra dimensions .",
    "our aim is to study such theories of potential phenomenological interest .",
    "we consider our starting point ten dimensional super yang - mills theory since it appears in the low - energy limit of the type i , iib and heterotic string theories .",
    "however when we start with extra dimensional theories , how to realize chiral theory is one of important issues from the viewpoint of particle physics . introducing magnetic fluxes in extra dimensions",
    "is one way to realize chiral fermions in field theories and superstring theories  @xcite . in particular , magnetized d - brane models",
    "are t - duals of intersecting d - brane models and several interesting models have been constructed within the framework of intersecting d - brane models  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we introduce the @xmath4 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with various dimensions .",
    "we use the kluza - klein dimensional reductions for obtaining the internal wavefunctions .",
    "the internal wavefunctions are chosen to be eigenstates of the internal laplace and dirac operators .",
    "we show that the chiral fermion can be obtain from the non - trivial solutions of wavefunctions due to the internal background flux .",
    "the low - energy physics is described by those of zero - mode wavefunctions .",
    "zero - modes are quasi - localized on the torus with the magnetic flux .",
    "the number of zero - modes , which corresponds to the generation number , is determined by the value of the magnetic flux in the same way as that the generation number is determined by the intersecting number in intersecting d - brane models .",
    "furthermore we extend this analysis to other backgrounds and other gauge groups .",
    "in such a case , we also obtain the explicit wavefunctions and calculate the spectra within a field theoretical way .",
    "let us consider @xmath36 super yang - mills theory in @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "its lagrangian density is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "here , @xmath39 denotes gaugino fields , @xmath40 is the gamma matrix for @xmath41 dimensions and the covariant derivative @xmath42 is given as @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the vector field .",
    "furthermore , the field strength @xmath45 is given by @xmath46.\\ ] ]    we consider the torus @xmath47 as the extra dimensional compact space , whose coordinates are denoted by @xmath48 @xmath49 , while the coordinates of four - dimensional uncompact space @xmath50 are denoted by @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "we use orthogonal coordinates and choose the torus metric such that @xmath48 is identified by @xmath53 with @xmath54 integer .",
    "the gaugino fields @xmath39 and the vector fields @xmath55 corresponding to the compact directions are decomposed as @xmath56      first , let us consider @xmath3 gauge theory on @xmath16 with the coordinates @xmath57 .",
    "we study the non - vanishing constant magnetic flux @xmath58 .",
    "we use the following gauge , @xmath59 then , their boundary conditions can be written as @xmath60    now , we study the spinor field @xmath61 with the @xmath3 charge @xmath62 on @xmath16 , which corresponds to the compact part in the decomposition ( [ eq : gaugino - decomp ] ) .",
    "the zero - mode satisfies the following equation , @xmath63 for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 corresponds to the gamma matrix for the two - dimensional torus @xmath16 , e.g. @xmath66 and @xmath61 is the two component spinor , @xmath67 because of ( [ eq : bc - gauge ] ) , the spinor field satisfies the following boundary condition , @xmath68 the consistency for the contractible loop , i.e. @xmath69 , @xmath70 , requires @xmath71 integer .    because of the periodicity along @xmath72 , @xmath73 can be written by @xmath74 suppose that @xmath75 .",
    "then , the solution for the zero - mode equation of @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant .",
    "furthermore the boundary condition requires @xmath79 and @xmath80 is equal to @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "thus , there are @xmath83 independent zero - modes of @xmath76 , which have normalizable wavefunctions , @xmath84\\left ( m(y_4+iy_5 ) , mi\\right),\\ ] ] for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a normalization constant and @xmath87 \\left ( m(y_4+iy_5 ) , mi\\right ) = \\sum_n e^{-m\\pi ( n+j / m)^2   + 2\\pi ( n+j / m)m(y_4+iy_5)},\\ ] ] that is , the jacobi theta - function .",
    "we can introduce the complex structure modulus @xmath88 by replacing the above jacobi theta - function as @xmath87 \\left ( m(y_4+iy_5 ) , mi\\right ) \\rightarrow   \\vartheta \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } j / m \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] \\left ( m(y_4+\\tau y_5 ) , m \\tau \\right).\\ ] ] thus , zero - mode wavefunctions depend on only the complex structure modulus , but not the overall size of @xmath16 . furthermore , there is the degree of freedom to shift @xmath89 with constants @xmath90 .",
    "they correspond to constant wilson lines .",
    "their localization points of zero - mode profiles are different each other and depend on the index @xmath91 and constants .",
    "their wavefunction profiles for @xmath92 are shown in the figure  [ fig : wf3 ]    on the other hand , the zero - mode equation for @xmath93 can be solved in a similar way , but their wavefunctions are unnormalizable .",
    "hence , we can derive chiral theory by introducing magnetic fluxes .",
    "when @xmath94 , @xmath93 has @xmath83 independent zero - modes with normalizable wavefunctions , while zero - modes for @xmath76 have unnormalizable wavefunctions .",
    "bosonic fields are analyzed in a similar way .",
