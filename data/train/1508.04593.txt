    "immersed boundary techniques , including penalization approaches , are nowadays commonly employed to solve boundary or initial boundary value problems in complex geometries .",
    "they consist of embedding the original , possibly complex spatial domain inside a bigger domain having a simpler geometry , for example a cartesian geometry , while keeping the boundary conditions approximately enforced thanks to new terms that are added to the equations .",
    "historically , the penalization technique can be traced back to courant @xcite in the context of constrained optimization .",
    "later , saulyev @xcite applied it in the context of fictitious domain methods for immersed boundaries . in a classical paper",
    "@xcite an immersed boundary method was proposed for computing the blood flow in a beating heart .",
    "some history on immersed boundary techniques can be found in @xcite , and for detailed reviews we refer to the classical review papers @xcite and @xcite . in the current work we focus on one particular example , the volume penalization method @xcite which , inspired by the physical intuition that a solid wall is similar to a vanishingly porous medium , uses the brinkman - darcy drag force as penalization term .",
    "the main advantage of such penalized equations is that they can be discretized independently of the geometry of the original problem , since the latter has been encoded into the penalization terms .",
    "such a simplification permits a massive reduction in solver development time , since it avoids the issues associated with the design and management of the grid , allowing for example the use of simple fast fourier transform ( fft)-based spectral solvers in cartesian geometries .",
    "using spectral solvers no linear systems have to be solved , e.g. , to impose the incompressibility of the magnetic and velocity fields .",
    "furthermore the penalized equations are solved without introducing additional discretization errors , and thus effects of numerical diffusion and dispersion present in low - order numerical schemes are avoided . moreover ,",
    "parallel fft libraries ( e.g. , p3dfft ) are available on the current supercomputers .",
    "the advantage of the penalization method becomes even more substantial when the geometry is time - dependent , as in the case of moving obstacles , or when fluid - structure interaction is taken into account .    in the following we give a non exhaustive overview of the development for different applications using volume penalization .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamic flows in staggered or inline tube bundles have been computed in @xcite and a dipole - wall collision benchmark using different numerical discretizations of the penalized navier ",
    "stokes equations has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "final states in two - dimensional decaying hydrodynamic turbulence in different geometries have been studied in @xcite and flows past flat plates focusing on the influence of the plate s geometry in @xcite .",
    "nguyen van yen et al . ( 2011 ) @xcite computed dipole - wall collisions and derived the scaling of the energy dissipation in the large reynolds number limit .",
    "they showed that it converges indeed to a finite value .",
    "the penalized wave equation has been analysed in @xcite .",
    "applications to moving obstacles and fluid - structure interaction problems can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite a numerical study using the volume penalization method for impeller - driven von krmn flows has been performed .",
    "different simulations of compressible flows in complex geometries using the volume penalization have been described in @xcite .",
    "an adaptive penalty method for incompressible navier - stokes has been proposed by shirokoff and nave @xcite .",
    "the extension of penalization techniques to magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows is more recent .",
    "simulations of the self - organization of confined plasma in two space dimensions studying the influence of the confinement geometry have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the numerical method has been extended to three space dimensions and is described and benchmarked in detail in @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous spin - up of plasma in toroidal geometries using the viscous - resistive mhd equations has been discovered in morales et al .",
    "the effect of toroidicity in reversed field pinch devices is studied in @xcite .",
    "roberts et al .",
    "@xcite investigated helically forced mhd flows in cylindrical geometries and showed the persistence of helical modes even when the dynamics becomes turbulent a penalty method for hyperbolic partial differential equations modeling the edge plasma transport in a tokamak has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to review the volume penalization method and to illustrate its potential for applications in fluid and plasma turbulence in complex domains .",
    "typically dirichlet boundary conditions are considered corresponding to imposing the value of the solution at the boundary . extensions for dealing with neumann boundary conditions , i.e. , imposing values of the derivative of the solution at the boundary , have been proposed in @xcite based on previous work in @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach for imposing either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions which is based on sharp interface methods has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "considering simple examples in one space dimension allows an understanding and analysis of the convergence behavior of the penalization techniques when the penalization parameter tends to zero .",
    "we show that , for a given numerical discretization of the penalized equations , there exists a value of the penalization parameter , corresponding to a balance between penalization and discretization errors , below which no further gain in precision is achieved .",
    "these results shed light on the behavior of volume penalization schemes when solving the penalized equations , outline the limitations of the method , and give indications on how to choose the penalization parameter at least in simple test cases .",
    "nevertheless for practical applications a series of computations may be necessary to determine the actual value of the parameters , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "finally , different illustrations will be given for hydro- and magnetohydrodynamic problems in the turbulent regime including a study of the spatio - temporal self - organization of visco - resistive magnetohydrodynamics in toroidal geometries with different poloidal cross - sections while imposing curl - free toroidal magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "first , we present a short primer on penalization .",
    "then we describe in some detail the volume penalization to impose either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions and we present some simple one - dimensional examples . applications to fluid and plasma turbulence in two and three dimensions illustrate the properties of the method .",
    "finally , we set out the conclusions together with some perspectives for future work .",
    "to illustrate the idea of volume penalization we consider a boundary ( bvp ) or initial boundary value problem ( ibvp ) for a partial differential equation in a domain @xmath0 , written in the following abstract operator equation @xmath1 completed with boundary conditions @xmath2 at @xmath3 and additional initial conditions in case of an ibvp .",
    "the differential operator @xmath4 stands , for example , for the laplace operator , @xmath5 , or the navier  stokes or maxwell operator .",
    "the boundary conditions can be of dirichlet or neumann type , e.g. , @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 is the outer normal of the domain .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pde ] ) numerically requires domain - fitted grids using , e.g. , finite elements . the grid generation and the numerical solution of the resulting discretized problem",
    "can be demanding , see for example @xcite .",
    "an alternative are penalization methods which embed the problem posed in the complexly shaped domain @xmath9 into a larger simple domain , typically of rectangular shape @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "the advantage is that fast solvers are available for such problems , which can furthermore be easily parallelized .    in the dirichlet case",
    "the penalized problem thus reads @xmath12 where the boundary conditions have been included into the equation and an additional parameter , the small penalization parameter @xmath13 has been introduced .",
    "all information about the geometry of @xmath9 has been encoded into the mask function @xmath14 , which is defined as @xmath15 in the domain @xmath9 the mask function vanishes identically and thus the original pde in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pde ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the difference between between the solution @xmath16 of the original pde  ( [ eqn : pde ] ) and the solution of the penalized problem @xmath17 ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pde_penal ] ) ) is the penalization ( or modeling ) error , which depends on the size of the penalization parameter @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 describes the order of the penalization method and @xmath21 is a suitable norm , e.g. , the energy norm @xmath22 or the @xmath23 or @xmath24 norm . for convergence of the method the solution of the penalized problem @xmath17 should tend towards the solution of the original problem @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "thus @xmath26 is required for convergence of the method . for the volume penalization we have @xmath27 @xcite .    applying a numerical method to the penalized pde eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pde_penal ] ) we obtain the discretized penalized equation , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the number of grid points and @xmath31 is the discretized version of the operator @xmath4 . in the case of an ibvp",
    "a suitable time discretization is also necessary .",
    "explicit time discretization of the penalization term implies a time step restriction for stability .",
    "typically the time step is limited by @xmath18 and hence the problem becomes stiff in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "the solution of the discretized penalized equations @xmath33 , given that the discretization is consistent and the numerical scheme is stable , converges towards the exact solution @xmath17 of the penalized equation ( [ eqn : pde_penal ] ) .",
    "the discretization error , @xmath34 depends not only on the order of the numerical scheme , but is also limited by the regularity , i.e. , the smoothness of the exact solution @xmath17 of the penalized problem .",
    "the order @xmath35 is thus determined as the mimum of the order of the underlying numerical scheme and the regularity of the exact penalized solution .",
    "finally , the question in computations using the penalization method concerns the error between the exact solution @xmath16 of the bvp ( or ibvp ) given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pde ] ) and the numerical solution of the penalized equation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pde_penal_discret ] ) .",
    "this total error has two contributions : the modeling error which is due to the penalization ; and the discretization error which is due to the numerical solution of the discretized problem . applying the triangle inequality",
    "the following estimate holds : @xmath36 and thus we obtain a bound for the total error .",
    "a straightforward argument would suggest choosing very small values for @xmath18 to minimize the modeling error .",
    "however this would imply that the problem becomes stiff , one loses regularity in the exact solution of the penalized problem and the leading - order constant of the discretization error blows up and a very fine grid would become necessary . thus to optimize the estimate",
    "both errors should be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this shows that the penalization parameter @xmath18 and the numerical resolution @xmath30 of the discretized problem are coupled and should be chosen accordingly . for further discussion",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "immersed into the solid domain @xmath37 .",
    "the boundary of the fluid domain is denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the total computational domain is @xmath39 . ]",
    "for illustration we consider first a simple toy problem , the poisson equation in one space dimension , @xmath40 completed with either homogeneous dirichlet ( @xmath41 for @xmath42 ) or neumann boundary conditions ( @xmath43 for @xmath42 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath44 0,\\pi [ $ ] and for the right - hand side @xmath45 a trigonometric function , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , with @xmath48 .",
    "the exact solution is @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the dirichlet and neumann case , respectively .",
    "the additive constant @xmath51 shows that the solution is not unique for neumann boundary conditions . to guarantee in this case the existence of a solution",
    ", the right - hand side @xmath45 has to satisfy the compatibility condition , @xmath52 .",
    "now we replace the original problems by the penalized problems . the domain @xmath44 0 , \\pi [ $ ] is embedded in the larger domain @xmath53 0 , 2 \\pi [ $ ] .",
    "thus we have @xmath39 , where @xmath37 is the penalization domain . for further simplification",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions at the boundary of @xmath10 .",
    "in the dirichlet case we obtain the penalized poisson equation @xmath54 0 , 2 \\pi [ \\ ] ] while in the neumann case we have @xmath55 0 , 2 \\pi [ \\label{eqn : poisson1d_penalized_neumann}\\ ] ] the penalization term in the dirichlet case forces the solution to vanish inside the penalization domain and thus imposes homogeneous dirichlet conditions at the interface . in the neumann case",
    "the boundary condition corresponds to zero flux through the interface of @xmath9 and @xmath56 .",
    "this can be achieved by imposing vanishing diffusivity ( of order @xmath18 ) inside the penalization domain .",
    "the function @xmath45 is extended in the larger domain by zero padding , i.e. , @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "again both problems can be solved analytically in each sub - domain and we obtain in the dirichlet case @xcite @xmath590 , \\pi [ \\\\          \\frac{m^2 \\eta}{1 + \\eta m^2 } \\sin mx + b_1 \\exp(-x/\\sqrt \\eta ) + b_2 \\exp(x/\\sqrt \\eta )     \\quad   \\mbox{\\rm for } \\quad x \\in ] \\pi , 2 \\pi [      \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] and in the neumann case @xcite @xmath600 , \\pi [ \\\\          b_1 x + b_2             \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\mbox{\\rm for } \\quad x \\in ] \\pi , 2 \\pi [      \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] imposing continuity of the solution and of the derivative at @xmath61 and @xmath62 the coefficients ( @xmath63 ) can be determined .",
    "the corresponding values can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that in the neumann case only three out of the four coefficients can be determined as the solution is not unique .",
    "the penalization error @xmath64 can thus be explicitly computed and we find in the dirichlet case the expected @xmath65 behavior , while in the neumann case an @xmath66 behavior is found which is better than @xmath65 shown in @xcite for the heat equation . in fig .",
    "[ fig_error_1dpoisson ] ( top ) the exact solution of the penalized dirichlet problem is plotted for two values of @xmath18 ( left ) together with the first derivative ( right ) .",
    "we find that for decreasing @xmath18 the penalized solution tends towards the solution of the unpenalized problem .",
    "we also observe the existence of a boundary layer in the penalized domain ( at the interface of @xmath9 and @xmath37 , close to @xmath62 ) which becomes steeper when @xmath18 becomes smaller . for @xmath67",
    "we find that the first derivative becomes almost discontinuous at @xmath68 .",
    "this shows that the regularity of @xmath17 is lost in the limit of small @xmath18 and the problem becomes stiff .      to solve the penalized equations",
    "numerically we apply a second - order finite difference discretization to the penalized problems ( [ eqn : poisson1d_penalized_dirichlet ] ) and ( [ eqn : poisson1d_penalized_neumann ] ) .",
    "the computational domain @xmath69 $ ] is discretized with @xmath30 grid points @xmath70 applying periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we obtain the following linear system in the dirichlet case @xmath71 with the vectors @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 in @xmath75 , the identity matrix @xmath76 and where @xmath77 is the second - order central finite difference operator with @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting tridiagonal system can be solved using standard numerical linear algebra tools .    in the neumann case",
    "we get a second - order approximation with the following finite difference scheme , @xmath79 where @xmath80 $ ] with @xmath81 .",
    "the first order backward and forward finite difference operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined respectively , by @xmath84 the linear system ( [ poisson1d_penalized_linsystem_neumann ] ) is singular , the matrix has an eigenvalue @xmath85 and a solution only exists if the right - hand side @xmath86 is in its image .",
    "special care has to be taken for solving the linear system using either the pseudo - inverse , or removing one equation .",
    "performing numerical experiments @xcite showed that second - order convergence of the numerical solution of the penalized equations towards the exact solution can be obtained , under the condition that @xmath18 is sufficiently small . moreover , for fixed @xmath18 the total error ( modeling plus discretization error ) has a minimum at @xmath87 .",
    "[ fig_error_1dpoisson ] ( bottom ) illustrates this for the dirichlet case .",
    "varying @xmath18 with @xmath88 like @xmath89 thus yields the best results in terms of minimum total error  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it must be mentioned that for spectral or fourth - order finite difference discretizations only first - order convergence can be observed .",
    "the explanation is that the linear system using second - order finite differences is exactly the same for the penalized problem as for the original dirichlet problem at all points inside the fluid domain , except at @xmath90 and @xmath91 where values of @xmath65 are involved  @xcite .",
    "hence for sufficiently small values of @xmath18 second - order convergence can be found .",
