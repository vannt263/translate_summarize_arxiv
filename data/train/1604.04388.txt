    "tightly collimated streams of plasma with speeds close to the speed of light , commonly referred to as relativistic jets , are present in a variety of astrophysical objects , e.g. , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) powered by the relativistic wind of pulsars , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) from the death of massive stars or compact star mergers , and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at the center of galaxies .",
    "the relativistic jets propagate through the ambient medium and excite the double shock structures afterwards .",
    "acceleration of particles is ubiquitous in the astrophysical shocks @xcite .",
    "non - thermal emission from these environments is usually considered as synchrotron or inverse compton radiation from a power - law distribution of electrons accelerated at shock sides @xcite . due to the lack of a perfectly self - consistent theory of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks ,",
    "the power - law index and the acceleration efficiency , i.e. , the fraction of particles and energy in the non - thermal tail , are usually compared with the observations .",
    "charged particles may be accelerated via first - order fermi acceleration ( or diffusive shock acceleration , dsa ) in the collisionless shocks . in dsa",
    ", particles diffuse back and forth across the shock front and gain energy by scattering from the magnetohydrodynamics waves @xcite .",
    "however , dsa needs a seed population of particles with energies well in excess of the thermal ones , because only these particles are capable for multiple crossing the shock front and effective scattering by magnetic turbulences .",
    "however , it is not apparent how the electrons can reach the threshold energy of dsa .",
    "it demands their kinetic energies be comparable to those of the ions .",
    "this is known as the electron injection problem @xcite .    in the case of magnetized upstream",
    ", the injection of electrons is thought to be directly associated with the background motional electric field @xmath4 .",
    "they may gain energy from the motional electric field while they gyrate ",
    "surf around the shock front . based on the barrier that reflects the electrons toward the upstream ,",
    "thus capable them for repeatedly energizations , this process is known with distinct names .",
    "if the reflecting barrier has a magnetic source , e.g. , gradient of the magnetic field at the leading edge of the shock , the acceleration mechanism is named shock drift acceleration or sda @xcite .",
    "if the barrier has an electrostatic source , e.g. , the electrostatic solitary waves appeared at the leading edge of the shock by buneman instability @xcite , the process is called shock surfing acceleration or ssa @xcite .",
    "basically , the ssa process acts only in the electron - ion shocks , because electrostatic barrier would not be generated if the species have the same inertia .",
    "magnetization parameter , obliquity angle of the upstream magnetic field with respect to the shock direction of propagation , and bulk lorentz factor of the incoming stream may also play significant role in determining the responsible process for particle acceleration .    an interesting question is : `` how does the electron ejection operate in unmagnetized electron - ion shocks ? '' . due to the lack of upstream motional electric field",
    ", we expect a process other than sda and ssa .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations provide a self - consistent description of particle acceleration in collisionless shocks .",
    "our works have been allocated to the large scale pic simulations of electron injection in unmagnetized relativistic electron - ion shocks . in pic simulations ,",
    "the shock waves are usually excited by the so - called injection approach @xcite . using this approach ,",
    "a high - speed plasma stream is launched from one end of the computational grid and reflected from a rigid boundary at the opposite end .",
    "subsequently , a shock is excited due to the interactions between the incoming and the reflected streams .",
    "although this method reduces by one - half the number of calculations , it has some disadvantages as well . in this method ,",
    "the reverse and forward shock are degenerated ( not distinguishable ) and the simulations are limited to two identical counter - streaming beams .",
    "however , we are interested in asymmetric jet - ambient interaction , i.e. , the interaction of plasmas with different properties that results in two different shocks , trailing shock ( ts ) and leading shock ( ls ) , and a contact discontinuity ( cd ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we have performed a 3d pic simulation where collisionless double shock is created by an unmagnetized relativistic jet propagating into an unmagnetized ambient plasma .",
    "in contrast to the injection method , our asymmetric jet - ambient model is more realistic since it avoids an infinitely sharp cd and permits us to appropriately explore the dynamics of the ts and ls for different jet - ambient parameters .",
    "beam - plasma ( or jet - ambient ) systems are susceptible to several instabilities , e.g. , electrostatic two - stream or buneman modes @xcite , and electromagnetic filamentation @xcite or weibel @xcite modes .",
    "therefore , the unstable spectrum is not less than 2d . which of these modes will dominate highly relies on the system parameters @xcite .",
    "this undoubtedly clears a demand for studies using a method like ours @xcite , or using asymmetric counter - streaming beams @xcite , cause the most unstable modes excited in various setups can generate the totally different shock waves .",
    "our paper is dedicated to answer five questions : first , how does the double shock structure form in the unmagnetized jet - ambient interactions ?",
    "second , the shocks are characterized by magnetic or electrostatic forces ?",
    "third , what are the main processes responsible for electron injection ?",

    "a series of test simulations are already performed to establish a numerical model which best conserves energy and minimizes numerical self - heating . in the pic simulations including a cold relativistic plasma beam , a numerical heating instability arises when the beam propagates large distances over the numerical grid .",
    "the instability is a combination of grid - cherenkov instability and spurious plasma oscillations @xcite .",

    "when the particles jet interacts with the ambient plasma , the distribution of particles is extremely anisotropic and is susceptible to several instabilities , e.g. , electrostatic modes ( two - stream or buneman instabilities ) , and electromagnetic modes ( filamentation or weibel instabilities ) .",
    "depending on the jet - to - ambient density ratio , jet and ambient temperatures , and jet drift velocity , two - stream , filamentation , or oblique modes will dominate the linear phase .",

    "the jet electrons are rapidly decelerated when interact with ambient particles to form electron current filaments in both jet and ambient plasmas ( figure [ cdf]a ) . as a result , the density of the jet electron increases from @xmath59 to @xmath60 just behind the jet front ( figure [ cdf]b ) . on other hand ,",
    "ambient electrons become swept by the incoming jet stream ( figure [ cdf]c ) and the density of the ambient electron is increased by a factor of three near the jet front ( figure [ cdf]d ) . in this stage ( about @xmath61 ) , a cd is formed around @xmath62 that separate decelerated jet electrons pile from the accelerated ambient electrons pile .",
    "the decelerated jet electrons become mainly confined to the left side of cd and pile up in this region . however , due to the cd formation , the accelerated ambient electrons are dominantly confined to the right side of the cd and they pile up due to the continuous sweeping by the jet inflow . once trapped in the left side of cd , the jet electron populations commence heating .    due to ion larger inertia ,",
    "the jet ions are able to penetrate deeper into the ambient plasma without significant deceleration ( figures [ cdf]e and [ cdf]f ) and ambient ions are present in deeper length of the jet stream ( figures [ cdf]g and [ cdf]h ) .",
    "therefore , a certain fraction of both ion populations ( jet and ambient ) is present in each other before the cd be fully formed .",
    "these fractions form a separate population on the two sides of the cd .",
    "each of this population is affected by another plasma medium ( jet or ambient ) and is reflected back towards the cd . for the ambient fraction ,",
    "since the ions have no means to either pass through the cd or escape from the continuous flow of jet particles , they are trapped in the left side of cd and will eventually become part of the ts population .",
    "this population is visible in the ambient ion phase - space and density plots in figures [ cdf]g and [ cdf]h . due to their highly relativistic forward momentum ( @xmath63 ) ,",
    "deceleration of the jet ions by the ambient plasma will take place in later stages , after the formation of ls in the ambient particles .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic properties of jet and ambient plasmas ( density and temperature ) would be different across the ls .",
    "it leads to the formation of a double layer ( will be discussed in section [ formation of the double layers ] ) which causes tapping another fraction of the ambient ions in the right side of the cd .",
    "this population will become part of the ls .     when the fastest jet ions reach @xmath64 .",

    "since the ambient plasma located in the right side of our simulation box represents the interstellar medium and the jet plasma coming from the left represents the ejecta , we designate the right shock as the ls and the left shock as the ts .",

    "principally , the type of instability is not important for the evolution of the double layer because it forms behind it .",
    "the electric field of the double layer is strong inasmuch as it can slow down the jet ions by a factor of 50 % from the initial momentum @xmath97 ( figure [ dl1]e ) , which supports the energy for the electron acceleration .",

    "the electrons become efficiently heated .",
    "the maximum attainable energy for an electron during drift motion has been estimated analytically @xcite where the electron energy density is proportional to the square root of the magnetic field energy density , normalized to the total incoming energy density , @xmath106 . using this expression , the average change in the electron energy , @xmath107 , due to the transverse electric fields of ion filaments",

    "as one can see , in the trailing edge , @xmath108 , the electrons ( mostly jet electrons ) are heated by the ion filament up to @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , due to the presence of a double layer in the trailing edge , the electrons can gain more energy within the double layer electric field .",
    "the maximum attainable energy through the double layer in the trailing edge is @xmath94 ( figure [ heating]c ) .",

    "the common observational characteristic of pwne , grbs afterglows , and agn jets is a broad non - thermal spectrum of synchrotron and inverse compton emission that extend from the radio up to the gamma - ray band .",
    "one of the key ingredients in creating this non - thermal spectrum is a non - thermal , high - energetic electron population .",
    "this population may be seen in the electron distribution function , where a pure 3d maxwell - jttner distribution ( in our case ) does not account for the high energies .",
    "in fact , a more complex distribution function is expected as a result of electron acceleration . shown in figures [ spectrum ]",
    "are the evolution of the electron distribution function in time ( figure [ spectrum]a taken in the leading edge , figure [ spectrum]b taken in the shocked region , and figure [ spectrum]c taken in the trailing edge ) . at late stages , in both leading and trailing edges , the electron distribution function consists of a drifting maxwell - jttner distribution ( our rest frame of reference is the ambient ) and a high - energy tail .",
    "the electron distribution function in the shocked region illustrates a hot well mixed population ( includes jet and ambient ) with a drifting maxwell - jttner distribution .",
    "the electron distribution functions in figures [ spectrum]a and [ spectrum]c clearly develop a non - thermal tail over time . for @xmath114 ,",
    "when the counter - streaming shock - reflected ions come to account and strong double layer form in the trailing edge , the electron are accelerated within the double layer . in this manner ,",
    "their temperature do not changed significantly .",
    "this process is visible in the inset panel of figure [ spectrum]c where the most probable momentum , @xmath115 , is constant for @xmath114 .",
    "the white line shows a power - law fit to the non - thermal , high - energy electron population .",
    "the power - law begins around @xmath116 and extends to high energies with an exponential cutoff .",
    "the power - law index @xmath117 , defined in @xmath118 , has a best - fit value @xmath119 in the leading edge , and @xmath120 in the trailing edge .",
    "the non - thermal tail in the electron distribution function ( figure [ spectrum]a and [ spectrum]c ) extends with time to higher and higher energies .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that electron acceleration is efficient and persevering in time . regarding electron distribution function in the leading edge , at time @xmath81 ,",
    "the non - thermal tail for @xmath121 contains @xmath0 of electrons ( @xmath122 ) and @xmath1 of electron energy ( @xmath123 ) in the leading edge .",
    "the acceleration efficiency for electron is @xmath2 by number and @xmath3 by energy in the trailing edge , calculated in the same way as the leading edge .",
    "theoretically , an ensemble of electrons with a power - law energy distribution function @xmath124 ( for the ultra - relativistic speeds @xmath125 ) result in a radiation spectrum @xmath126 @xcite , where the spectral index @xmath36 is related to the particle distribution index @xmath117 by @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , @xmath128 in the electron energy distribution results in the spectral index @xmath129 which is in the range of the radio up to optical and x - ray emission @xcite .",

    "we find that the phase - space distributions of the particles and density structure agree well in terms of both the formed shock structure and the double layers in the trailing and leading edges",
    ". however the adiabatic index @xmath132 in the 2d domain results in the slower shocks ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) and smaller particle compression ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) compared to the 3d structure .",
    "the time evolution of the electron distribution function from the 2d run is displayed in figures [ spectrum2 ] . in 2d run ,",
    "the observed power - law index of the electron distribution function is @xmath137 in the leading edge , and @xmath138 in the trailing edge .",
    "the harder spectral index in 2d run can mean that the electron acceleration is more efficient than in 3d .",
    "actually , the non - thermal tail in electron distribution function contains @xmath139 of electrons and @xmath140 of energy in the leading edge , and @xmath141 of electrons and @xmath142 of energy in the trailing edge , respectively .    in the early phase ,",
    "the fields generated in the 3d simulation are stronger than in 2d , due to the additional transverse dimension that the 3d instability can gather particles from .",
    "however , at later stages the growth of fields in the 2d simulation surpasses the 3d case @xcite .",
    "this is primarily caused by two effects : first , a 2d system has less degrees of freedom for the motion of particles ; they are then more easily trapped and saturate in a larger amplitude .",
    "second , ion current filaments can merge to larger transverse structures .",

    "white line shows a power - law fit to the non - thermal component in the electron distribution function at the latest time . ]",
    "our motivation has been to recognize a mechanism that may accelerate electrons in the unmagnetized shock to energies , so that they can experience the dsa to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "the observational radio synchrotron emissions from the supernova remnant shocks confirm the existence of such electrons @xcite although their origin is still unclear .",
    "the electrons are injected into the dsa , if their kinetic energies be comparable to the ion kinetic energies @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the electrons are pre - accelerated by instabilities , those are excited by ion beams in the transition region of shocks @xcite .",
    "the origin of the ion beams is either the reflection of upstream ions by the shock or the leaking of downstream ions into the upstream plasma .",
    "however , buneman instability @xcite and weibel - like two - stream instability invoked in previous works @xcite are not strong enough to inject the electrons into the dsa .",
    "they may just transfer a few percent of the ions kinetic energy to the electrons .",
    "the present work investigates the secondary processes triggered by the weibel - like instabilities with a 3d pic code @xcite .",
    "the employed model of the simulation completely differs from the injection model used in several related papers @xcite .",
    "we have modeled an unmagnetized relativistic jet propagating into an ambient plasma .",
    "they contain ions and electrons .",
    "we have simulated the double shock system and our model is hence self - consistent .",
    "the jet moves with bulk speed @xmath146 in the @xmath18-direction relative to the ambient plasma .",
    "the initial temperatures of species in the jet and ambient have been set to @xmath147 kev and @xmath148 kev , respectively , in their rest frame .",
    "three spatial directions have been resolved by the current pic simulation , which implies that the wave spectrum driven by the weibel - like instabilities propagate obliquely with respect to the jet propagation direction @xcite .",
    "both filamentation and two - stream modes are present and operate simultaneously in electron heating .",
    "consequently , strong fluctuations occur in the density of electrons and ambient ions that result in the formation of the double shock system .",
    "the conclusions of the work presented here can be summarized as answers to the remarked questions in section [ introduction ] .    1 .",
    "`` how does the double shock structure form in the unmagnetized jet - ambient interactions ? '' + at early times , a cd forms between the decelerated jet electron and the swept ambient electrons .",
    "consequently , the jet electrons are accumulated at the right side of cd as part of ts .",
    "additionally , a fraction of the ambient ions are located in the right side of cd cause of ion higher rigidity .",
    "they are swept by the jet continuous stream and contribute at the ts due to the reflection by the cd .",
    "therefore , we have defined the ts as a pile of jet electrons and a fraction of ambient ions . on the other hand , the swept ambient electrons and the swept ambient ions in the right side of cd",
    "construct the ls . in a longer simulation ,",
    "when the jet ions become significantly decelerated , we expect that jet ions contribute in the both ts and ls structures .",
    "the shocks are characterized by magnetic or electrostatic forces ? '' + the electrostatic and magnetic effects are strongly activated at the same time in the captured double shock structure ( a similar situation was also found for non - relativistic shocks in @xcite ) .",
    "the transverse magnetic fields are induced due to the weibel - like instabilities in the jet - ambient interaction .",
    "these fields are dominantly azimuthal and associated with the ion current filaments . in the shocked region , the magnetic energy density , @xmath149 , is near 10% of jet energy density .",
    "transverse electric fields are also present around the ion current filaments due to the density filamentation by weibel - like instabilities .",
    "the longitudinal electrostatic fields are due to the formed double layers in the trailing and leading edges .",
    "both electrostatic force and @xmath150 drift motion are important and play significant role in electron dynamics . however , in the shocked region , the induced magnetic fields facilitate energy transfer between the jet and ambient plasma .",
    "`` what are the main mechanisms responsible for electron injection ? ''",
    "+ at first , the electrons are heated up to a maximum energy density @xmath106 via @xmath150 drift motion .",
    "additionally , the shock - reflected ambient ions trigger a double layer in the trailing edge which evolves consequently into an electrostatic shock .",
    "a double layer is also formed in the leading edge due to the decelerated jet ions and ambient electrons .",
    "the secondary electron energization process is associated with the electric fields of double layers .",
    "the drift speed of the free streaming particles is well in excess of the thermal one .",
    "it maintains the double layer structures in time .",
    "the substantial energy stored in the jet ions causes the electron acceleration up to 75 mev .",
    "the double layers convert forward energy of jet ions into forward energy of electrons , without heating up the electrons .",
    "electrons can thus be accelerated more efficiently by a double layer than by a shock because the latter spends part of flow energy for heating .",
    "4 .   `` what is the resulting electron distribution function ? '' + the electron distribution function includes a non - thermal tail that contains @xmath0 of electrons and @xmath1 of electron energy in the leading edge , and @xmath2 of electrons and @xmath3 of electron energy in the trailing edge , respectively .",
    "the power - law fit to the non - thermal tail has index @xmath120 in the trailing edge , @xmath119 in the leading edge , respectively .",
    "these results confirm that the double layers are more efficient than shocks in electron acceleration .",
    "based on the pic simulations , the shocks efficiency in particle acceleration is @xmath0 by number and @xmath151 by energy @xcite .",
    "5 .   `` what is the effect of the dimensionality ? '' + in the performed 2d simulation , the power - law index in the non - thermal tail is @xmath137 in the leading edge , and @xmath138 in the trailing edge , respectively .",
    "the non - thermal tail contains @xmath139 of electrons and @xmath140 of electron energy in the leading edge , and @xmath141 of electrons and @xmath142 of electron energy in the trailing edge , respectively .",
    "these mean that the electron acceleration in 2d is more efficient than in 3d .",
    "the present work uses a ion - electron mass ratio @xmath152 .",
    "although this low mass ratio is necessary to keep the computational costs of 3d simulations reasonable , it changes the growth rate of the unstable modes as well . in the early growth stage ,",
    "when the ions are not included in the instabilities , the magnetic fields energy increases exponentially , independent of the mass ratio .",
    "however , the mass ratio effect becomes significant in the nonlinear phase . when it is small compared to the realistic one ( 1836 ) , the saturation level of the magnetic field becomes higher , since the ion current filaments merge as similar as the electron ones , due to the mutual attraction between the filaments .",
    "increasing the mass ratio will reduce the ion isotropization rate and the rate of kinetic energy exchange with electrons via the weibel - like instabilities .",
    "moreover , it is found that weibel - like modes govern the high beam density regimes in the beam - plasma interactions @xcite .",
    "the domain of these modes expands as the mass ratio decreases .",
    "consequently , the domains governed by the oblique modes shrink with decreasing the mass ratio . therefore , our low mass ratio gives a higher importance to the weibel - like instabilities than what they normally have .    regarding the double layers ,",
    "the electrostatic potential jumps in the trailing and leading edges are established by the electron density and temperature jumps across the shocks .",
    "these jumps are in turn decided by the shock jump conditions that do not change significantly for different ion - to - electron mass ratios .",
    "hence , the electrostatic potentials of the double layers are independent on the mass ratio .",
    "however , increasing the mass ratio will increase the kinetic energy of the ions .",
    "the ions are thus more difficultly slowed down in the double layers , causing the slower rate of kinetic energy exchange between the ions and electrons . in this manner ,",
    "the ts , ls , and cd acquire their steady - state velocity later .",
