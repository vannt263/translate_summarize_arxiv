    "the formation of stars , brown dwarfs , and planets is associated with a rich phenomenology spanning almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum . during the star formation process",
    ", the circumstellar disk material can be accreted into one ( or more ) central objects , ejected along the stellar polar axis , dispersed through photo - evaporation or condensed into planetesimals .",
    "each of these processes is traced by a characteristic set of morphological and spectroscopic signatures , such as uv excess for stellar mass accretion @xcite , shock - excited line - emission from jets and herbig - haro objects @xcite , co outflows from the disks @xcite , or mid - ir and sub - mm signatures in the spectral energy distribution due to grain growth and possible disk clearing by a forming planetary system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "each tracer provides critical information on different aspects of the protostellar system , but only a comprehensive view allows reconstructing the full evolutionary scenario . in particular , by combining optical and ir observations it is possible to address key open questions like the formation of stellar companions , the fraction of disk mass accreted into the central star vs. time , the timescale of planetesimal formation @xcite .",
    "the hubble and the spitzer space telescopes offer the best available combination of field - of - view , sensitivity , spatial resolution , and wavelength coverage for studying most of these phenomena @xcite .",
    "the hst has repeatedly targeted the orion nebula and its associated young cluster , the archetype of star forming regions @xcite .",
    "hst observations resolved about 200 circumstellar disks , tens of jets and provided accurate broad - band photometry needed to determine the fundamental stellar parameters .",
    "unfortunately , the orion cluster is relatively distant ( @xmath5420pc ) , crowded and projected over the bright m42 hii  region .",
    "those factors make the orion nebula cluster a problematic target for spitzer , while ground - based mid - ir observations having adequate spatial resolution attain low sensitivity limits longward than @xmath6 m @xcite . on the other hand , there are other closer regions that have been extensively investigated by spitzer , but none of them has been studied with the hst with comparable detail . among them ,",
    "the chamaeleon i region is possibly the best site for combining the unique spitzer and hst capabilities .",
    "it is one of the nearest star - forming regions ( @xmath7=160 - 170 pc ; for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and nearly coeval to orion , making its low - mass members approximately 10 times brighter than orion .",
    "the cluster is young enough that it retains a significant population of primordial disks , but it is old enough that most of its members are no longer highly obscured by dust ( typically @xmath8 ) . like orion ,",
    "because of the relatively low extinction , optical wavelengths are accessible for the spectral classification of the stellar population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and for measuring accretion diagnostics @xcite .",
    "optical and near - ir imaging and spectroscopic surveys of chamaeleon  i have produced an extensive and virtually complete census of the stellar and substellar cluster members in the field @xcite : there are 237 known members , 33 of which have spectral types indicative of brown dwarfs ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the imf of chamaeleon i reaches a maximum at a mass of 0.1 - 0.15 @xmath10 , somewhat lower than the imf peak in orion .    in this paper",
    "we report on a study aimed at probing a sample of chamaeleon i sources with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) onboard hst .",
    "given the extent of region , about @xmath11 , we targeted selected fields centered on brown dwarfs , class i and ii pre - main - sequence ( pms ) objects measured by spitzer to uncover substellar companions down to 15 au separation and to directly image circumstellar disks and jets .",
    "we concentrate here on the sample of stellar pms objects , leaving the discussion of the brown dwarf survey to a second paper ( luhman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in section 2",
    "we illustrate our observing and data reduction strategy , detailing the extraction of photometry for both point sources and extended objects . in section 3",
    "we present the hst photometry , complemented by a compilation of ir and millimeter data available in the literature , including new data in the sub - mm range for 3 sources .",
    "we also list the main physical parameters of the stellar sources taken from the literature and derive mass accretion rates from our h@xmath1 photometry . in section 4",
    "we illustrate the morphology of individual objects , while in section 5 we model the seds for 19 sources using a sed fitting tool ; we derive disk parameters that can be compared wih stellar mass , age , luminosity and mass accretion rate .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize our findings .",
    "the data presented in this paper have been obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in early 2009 ( hst go program 11983 , p.i .",
    "robberto ) .",
    "these are among the latst data taken with the aging instrument , just preceeding the servicing mission 4 which replaced wfpc2 with wfc3 .",
    "we targeted 20 fields centered on t tauri stars , detecting 18 of them . for two sources , iso - chai 150 and cha j11081938 - 7731522 , known for being highly obscured by circumstellar dust @xcite",
    ", we can only provide detection upper limits .",
    "other 13 members of the chamaeleon  i complex lying in our imaged fields have also been identified and are presented in this paper .",
    "one hst  orbit was dedicated to each field , placing the target on the standard aperture spot of the wfpc2 planetary camera ( pc ) chip , with 45.5  mas / pixel scale .",
    "we did not constrain the telescope roll angle .",
    "observations were carried out in the narrow - band filters f631n ( [ oi ] @xmath12 ) , f656n ( h@xmath1 ) , and f673n ( centered on the [ sii ] @xmath13 , 6731 doublet ) , plus the f547 m  medium - band filter roughly corresponding to the johnson v - band . the single exposure times were set at 100  s ( f631n ) , 40  s ( f656n ) , 100  s ( f673n ) and typically 40  s  for the f547 m filter ( only for the brightest stars the f547 m  were shorter to prevent saturation ) with four exposures per filter taken in two groups of two .",
    "each group was centered at a slightly different position (  two - point dither \" ) for optimal bad pixels and cosmic ray rejection @xcite .",
    "each set of four images was processed by the opus  pipeline and combined using the multidrizzle software @xcite .",
    "we used the multidrizzle parameters recommended for two - point dithered observations , treating separately the pc chip from the other 3 wide field ( wf ) chips , due to the different pixel scale .",
    "the images processed by multidrizzle are corrected for geometric distortion introduced by the wfpc2 optics , cleaned from bad pixels and cosmic rays , and recombined into a single integrated image properly oriented in right ascension and declination .",
    "we used starfind  ( in the stsdas library of pyraf ) to determine the location on the ccds of all sources in the field .",
    "after visually inspecting each individual source to reject false identifications we performed aperture photometry with daophot using a circular aperture of 3 pixels in radius ( corresponding to 0137 on the pc and 0299 on the wf chips ) .",
    "the small extraction radius was chosen to optimally estimate the magnitude of weak sources , the large majority .",
    "we did not perform psf  photometry due to the non - negligible charge transfer inefficiency trails of the aging instrument .",
    "since the values of the zero points derived from the photoflam keyword refer to counts measured within an `` infinite '' aperture , we performed an aperture correction to convert the counts measured in our 3 pixel extraction radius to the value expected in the 05 radius associated with the zero points . to this purpose we selected , for each filter and camera , a set of bright unsaturated and isolated sources and compared the results obtained with the two apertures .",
    "the average ratio , estimated with a sigma clipping algorithm , provided the aperture correction , together with the corresponding standard deviation .",
    "this allowed us to derive absolute magnitudes and errors in the hst  stmag system . for the narrowband filters we derived the flux in the more appropriate photflam  ( erg @xmath14s@xmath15@xmath15 ) system ( for the conversion from counts to flux see * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we applied a correction for charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) loss following @xcite .",
    "a direct measure of the fwhm reveals that a number of sources are extended . to discriminate between extended and non - extended sources",
    ", we used the set of bona - fide point sources to build average point spead functions valid for the pc and wf cameras .",
    "the fwhm of these psfs turned out slightly larger than the theoretical fwhm provided by the hst psf simulator tiny tim ( of the order of 2 pixels for both channels ) , as expected since multidrizzle can not fully recover the optimal psf with only two pointings .",
    "the photometry of extended sources was determined using extraction radii large enough to contain all the signal above @xmath16 sky noise floor .",
    "we did not apply any corrections for cte losses , as this is mostly relevant for small apertures .      as part of a larger project carried our with the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) and with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) facilities",
    ", we obtained new millimeter wavelength data for three sources : eso h@xmath1 - 559 ( source # 10 ) , iso - chai 10 ( # 5 ) and hh48 a ( # 7 ) .",
    "the first two were observed with apex , a 12-m submm telescope in chile s atacama desert , with the large apex bolometer camera ( * ? ? ?",
    "* laboca ; ) operating at the central frequency of 345 ghz ( or 870  @xmath17 m ) .",
    "the angular resolution of laboca is about 19 arcseconds and its total field of view is about 11 arcminutes .",
    "the observations , conducted under the project 086.c-0653 , were carried out on 2010 october 20 - 21 for a total of 4.4 h ( on source ) for eso h@xmath1 - 559 and on 2010 october 29 - 30 for a total 4.8 h ( on source ) for iso - chai 10 .",
    "atmospheric conditions were excellent , with a precipitable water vapor around 0.34 mm , corresponding to a zenith opacity of 0.18 .",
    "the sky opacity was measured every hour with skydips .",
    "the pointing of the telescope was checked every hour on the nearby quasar pks1057 - 79 .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was performed by observing the secondary calibrator b13134 every one or two hours .",
    "the telescope focus was checked by observing the star @xmath18 carinae , at least once per day .",
    "the observations were performed on the fly mode with a rectangular scanning pattern .",
    "the data were reduced with the bolometer array analysis software , following the procedures described in @xcite .",
    "the total ( flux ) calibration error is about 20% and the rms noise level in the final maps was @xmath55  mjy .",
    "we report a clear detection of the submm emission from eso h@xmath1 - 559 , but only an upper limit could be derived from our data for iso - chai 10 .",
    "hh 48 a was observed at 3.3  mm with atca and the new cabb digital filter bank , which provides a total continuum bandwidth of 4 ghz .",
    "observations were carried out at a central frequency of 91.000 ghz ( 3.294 mm ) on 2009 oct 14 .",
    "the atca array was in the hybrid h168 configuration , providing an angular resolution of about 3 arcsec at 3.3 mm .",
    "the gain was calibrated with frequent observations of 1057 - 797 .",
    "the passband was calibrated using 1921 - 293 , and the absolute flux scale was determined through observations of uranus .",
    "the uncertainty on the atca calibrated flux is about 30% at 3.3 mm .",
    "the miriad package was used for visibilities calibration , fourier inversion , deconvolution and imaging .",
    "the rms noise on the atca map was about 0.45 mjy .",
    "we also searched the literature finding seven more sources previously detected at wavelengths longer than 100  @xmath17m.all fluxes are reported in table  [ tab : phot_known ] , illustrated in the next section .",

    "the tool , based on a grid of 20,000 synthetic models , aims at reproducing the seds of disks around stars with masses between 0.1 and 50@xmath54 and ages between 1@xmath55 and 1@xmath56 years .    consistently with these limitations ,",

    "we also limited ourselves to sources detected by spitzer in at least one irac band , with some flux information at 24@xmath17 m or longer wavelengths , typically in the sub - mm , as these data points provide a critical constrain to the ir excess from the disk .",
    "we used the photometric data reported in tables 4 and 5 , plus our own f547 m photometry presented in table 3 .",

    "sources # 17 , # 27 and # 29 have a cluster member within the beam size of the sub - mm observations @xcite and therefore those data points were neglected .",

    "the free parameters are typically constrained by the fluxes at certain wavelengths . for example , the mass or the temperature of the star are characterized by the optical region of the sed , the inner radius or the flaring angle of the disk by the mid - far ir excess , while to constrain the disk mass one needs fluxes at @xmath59@xmath60100@xmath17 m .    given the lack of far - ir data , and the uncertainties due to the non - simultaneity of the observations , our problem is under - constrained and the sed model fitting tool returns several possible solutions . to clean - up the ensemble , for each source we considered only the solutions corresponding to values of @xmath61 and @xmath57 falling within @xmath23100k and @xmath231mag from the values given in table 4 .",
    "this is appropriate , considering that the spectral types and absolute temperature scale of low - mass stars have typical uncertainty of one sub - class .",
    "we also constrain the distance to be in the range between 130pc and 190pc , an artifice to allow for some variability of the source luminosity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as the average of the calculated distances remains close to 160  pc , this does not introduce systematic trends in the derived luminosities .",
    "we finally require that the difference between the @xmath58 and the best @xmath58 of each source must be smaller than 3 .",
    "this latter criterion , also adopted by @xcite to fit low - mass young stellar object ( yso ) seds , has been necessary because the model grid is too sparse to reliably search for the true minima of the @xmath58 hypersurface .",
    "since the minima of the @xmath58 hypersurface are difficult to resolve , we could not reliably identify the best fit model that formally represents the physics of the source , with its associated confidence interval .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , the distributions of fundamental parameters such as the stellar mass , age and total luminosity tend to show peaks independently on the finesse of the model grid . following these authors ,",
    "we have used these distribution ( constrained by our knowledge of the stellar parameters ) to derive the `` best fit '' parameters with their uncertainties , computing a weighted mean and a weighted standard deviation for each parameter and each source . for the weights we used the inverse of the @xmath58 returned by the sed model fitting tool . the mean and",
    "the standard deviation were computed on a logarithmic scale because the parameters in the grid are usually uniformly sampled in logarithmic scale .",
    "the resulting distributions of the stellar age and mass show that when a large number of models can be found , they tend to produce a rather narrow peak in the distribution of stellar parameters . only for three sources , # 18 , # 20 and # 29 , the number of models passing our selection criteria is small and the corresponding histograms do not show a peak . following this approach we were able to fit 19 seds , shown in fig .",
    "the physical parameters derived from the sed fitting , together with their uncertainties , are listed in tables [ s_par ] and [ d_par ] .    ]",
    "table [ s_par ] provides the parameters related to the central source : the entry number we assigned to each star in table 2 ( column 1 ) ; the @xmath58 per data - point of the best fit ( column 2 ) ; the number of fits that satisfy our selection criteria on @xmath61 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( column 3 ) ; and finally , in the last four columns , the bolometric luminosity , age , mass and radius of the central source .",

    "[ age_robsiess ] and [ mass_robsiess ] show that there is strong agreement .",
    "in particular , the strong correlation between the mass values is expected , since the model fitting assumed temperatures within @xmath80  k from the stellar temperatures and in this temperature range the mass is strongly correlated to the temperature .",
    "there are , however , four sources ( # 1 , # 10 , # 19 , # 21 ) for which the fitting tool provides ages and masses which are discrepant from those found in the literature .",
    "the younger ages we derive are a result of the higher bolometric luminosities returned by the fitter . for disk seen at high inclinations , taking into account the ir part of the sed allows to recover a non - negligible fraction of the stellar flux which would otherwise remain unaccounted for by a applying a simple reddening correction to the optical photometry . @xcite and @xcite , who derived @xmath79 from i and j band magnitudes for almost the entire known population of chamaeleon",

    "while this may be partially due to the sparse sampling of this parameter provided by the theoretical model , we must remark that the model may actually be biased toward larger angles , as it may not sample disks that are enough settled .",
    "the model adopts a fully flared disk ( in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ) and mimics the dust settling by multiplying the scale height at the dust sublimation radius by a `` zfactor '' .",
    "figure 6 in @xcite shows that the zfactor is a function of the disk outer radius , becoming equal or less than 0.5 only for relatively large disks .",
    "however , @xcite notice that the average sed of t - tauri stars in the chamaeleon - i region already requires a reduction of a factor of 2 in the disk scale height ; similar results are also reported by the spitzer infrared spectrograph gto team for taurus sources @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the grid of robitaille et al . may not properly sample the typical settling of ttau disks . in conclusion , the returned values for the tilt angle are only indicative , and therefore we use them to flag outliers without drawing any further conclusion .    to further investigate the possible correlations between the disk structure and the derived stellar properties",

    "these three sources , with nearly flat ir seds , were positioned according to @xcite below the zero - age - main - sequence and therefore , having no estimate for their mass and age , did not appear in figures  [ age_robsiess ] and [ mass_robsiess ] . the fitting tool returns for them a small number of successes , confirming that these systems have extreme properties .",
