    "gravitational wave detectors are fairly blunt instruments . in the low frequency limit , which corresponding to wavelengths large compared to the effective size of the detector , a gravitational wave detector s antenna pattern has only monopole , quadrupole and sextupole components . despite this limitation , it is in principle possible to locate a source with arbitrary precision so long as the signal - to - noise ratio is large and the motion of the detector with respect to the source is sufficiently fast and varied .",
    "gravitational wave detectors get their directional information from the amplitude and frequency modulation that occur as the antenna pattern is swept across the sky .",
    "the frequency modulation is due to the doppler shift caused by the relative motion of the source and the detector .",
    "for example , orbital motion about the sun creates a periodic frequency shift with amplitude @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the co - latitude in ecliptic coordinates .",
    "the amplitude modulation occurs as the antenna lobes are swept across the sky . for the ligo detectors@xcite",
    "this occurs with a fundamental period of one sidereal day , while for the lisa detector@xcite the fundamental period is one sidereal year .",
    "when we are lucky enough to have two detectors , differences in the arrival time can be used to furnish further directional information .",
    "a discussion of the angular resolution of ligo can be found in the work of jaranowski & krlak@xcite .",
    "discussions of the angular resolution of lisa can be found in the work of peterseim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , cutler@xcite and hellings & moore@xcite .",
    "in addition to individual bright sources of gravitational waves , there will also be a variety of unresolved gravitational wave backgrounds .",
    "it is likely that one component of the background will have a cosmological origin - the cosmic gravitational wave background ( cgb ) .",
    "however , the dominant contribution is expected to be a confusion background formed by the superposition of many weak point sources , such as white dwarf binaries .",
    "the gravitational wave backgrounds will be approximately stochastic , making them difficult to distinguish from noise in the detectors .",
    "one way around this problem is to cross - correlate the output from two detectors .",
    "since the noise in each detector is uncorrelated while the signal is correlated , the signal - to - noise improves as the square root of the observation time .",
    "typically , this type of correlation has to be done over a finite frequency interval @xmath2 that is large compared to the doppler modulation @xmath3 , so the frequency modulation is washed out .",
    "thus , maps of the gravitational wave background have to be made using amplitude modulation alone .    here",
    "we describe how gravitational wave detectors can be used to create maps of the gravitational wave background .",
    "the pioneering work of allen and ottewill@xcite showed how anisotropies in the gravitational wave background will modulate the output from the cross - correlated ligo detectors .",
    "a similar calculation was carried out by giampieri and polnorev@xcite in the low frequency limit ( @xmath4 mhz ) for the lisa detector .",
    "they showed how the signal would be modulated by the antenna s orbital motion .",
    "neither group addressed the inverse problem - that is , how to create a map of the gravitational wave sky from the modulated output .",
    "we address the inverse problem and find that the ground - based detectors that are currently under construction have the ability to produce maps with a resolution of @xmath5 at @xmath6 hz , where @xmath7 is the multipole number .",
    "this is comparable to the maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) produced by the cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) satellite .",
    "we find that a single lisa detector can produce a partial map with a resolution of @xmath8 at @xmath9 mhz , improving to @xmath10 at @xmath6 mhz .",
    "more than one lisa detector needs to be flown to produce a complete map .",
    "for example , two lisa detectors with a relative orbital inclination of @xmath11 degrees could produce a complete map with a resolution of @xmath12 .",
    "a full implementation of the theoretical scheme developed here will be published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "it involves an end - to - end simulation of the data analysis , starting with a synthetic gravitational wave sky that produces a modulated signal from a simulated gravitational wave detector .",
    "the detector model incorporates a basic treatment of the anticipated noise .",
    "finally , the simulated signal is deconvolved to produce a sky map that is compared to the original .",
    "suppose the gravitational wave background has a luminosity distribution given by @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 are coordinates on the sky in the cmb rest frame and @xmath15 is the gravitational wave frequency .",
    "the response of a gravitational wave detector can be characterized by a detector response function @xmath16 .",
    "the response varies with time as the detector moves relative to the sky .",
    "the detector output @xmath17 is given by the all - sky integral @xmath18 given the time series @xmath17 we need to find the luminosity distribution @xmath13 .",
    "it is natural to decompose the luminosity distribution and the detector response function into spherical harmonics in their respective rest frames .",
    "writing @xmath19 for basis vectors in the sky frame and @xmath20 for the detector frame we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the components of the coordinate transformation relating the two frames . in practice",
    "the gravitational fields will be weak and the velocities slow , so the coordinate transformation is well approximated by a spatial rotation .",
    "the coordinates @xmath14 in the sky frame are related to the coordinates @xmath23 in the detector frame by @xmath24 and @xmath25 we have written the transformations in this form since these are the combinations that appear in the spherical harmonics : @xmath26 decomposing @xmath13 and @xmath16 in the sky frame we have @xmath27 while in the detector s restframe we have @xmath28 the multipole moments in the two frames are related by @xmath29 where @xmath30 using equations ( [ tht ] ) , ( [ pac ] ) and ( [ sph ] ) it is a simple matter to calculate the transformation coefficients @xmath31 . from the properties of the spherical harmonics",
    "it follows that @xmath32 thus , there we only need to calculate @xmath33 components at order @xmath7 . out to order @xmath34 we have @xmath35 higher orders in @xmath7 involve higher powers of @xmath36 .",
    "for example , @xmath37 using the decompositions defined in ( [ decom ] ) , we can express the detector output in terms of the multipole moments @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 in most instances the detector scan pattern will be periodic in time , so it is natural to fourier transform all time dependent quantities : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the period of the detector sweep . we can write @xmath44 where @xmath45 it is a simple matter to calculate the @xmath46 if we know the detector response function @xmath47 and the scan pattern @xmath36",
    ". the de - convolution problem comes down to solving the linear system of equations @xmath48 the @xmath49 are known , the @xmath50 are measured experimentally , and the @xmath51 are what we want to find .",
    "typically the system of equations will be both under and over constrained , but a best fit solution can be found by way of a singular value decomposition .",
    "we begin by studying how ligo can be used to map the gravitational wave sky as a prelude to studying the space - based lisa detector .",
    "allen and ottewill@xcite showed how the cross - correlated response of the hanford and livingston ligo detectors is modulated as the rotation of the earth sweeps the antenna pattern across the sky .",
    "however , they stopped short of solving the deconvolution problem to make a map of the gravitational wave sky .    in a sky - fixed reference frame the response of a single ligo detector to a plane gravitational wave @xmath52 with frequency @xmath15 , propagating in the @xmath53 direction",
    "is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the detector tensor and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are unit vectors in the direction of the interferometer arms .",
    "the response to a general gravitational wave @xmath58 can be derived from ( [ basic ] ) by first decomposing the wave into a collection of plane waves : @xmath59 here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are a set of polarization tensors .",
    "the signal we wish to analyze is formed by cross - correlating the output of the two ligo detectors over an integration time @xmath62 , centered at time @xmath63 : @xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the outputs of the two detectors and @xmath67 is some filter function .",
    "a stochastic background of gravitational waves can be characterized by the statistical character of the fourier amplitudes @xmath68 . following allen and ottewill",
    "we assume that the background can be approximated as a stationary , gaussian random distribution characterized by the expectation values @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the power spectral density and @xmath71 describes the angular distribution . from these relations",
    "it follows that the expectation value of @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 here @xmath75 is a vector connecting the hanford and livingston sites and @xmath76    using @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we can write the signal as @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the real part of @xmath82 _ etc._. in contrast to allen and ottewill , who considered the broad - band response , we are interested in making narrow band measurements over a small frequency interval of width @xmath2 centered at frequency @xmath15 .",
    "this allows us to make maps of the gravitational wave sky at particular frequencies .",
    "to this end we use the top - hat filter @xmath83 so that @xmath84 in the time domain the filter decays rapidly for times @xmath85 . in choosing @xmath2",
    "we have to ensure that @xmath86 , otherwise the angular variation will be smeared out .",
    "so long as @xmath2 is small compared to the range over which @xmath70 and @xmath82 vary , the narrow band response is given by @xmath87 this equation is of the form @xmath88 where the luminosity equals @xmath89 and the detector response function is given by @xmath90 the choice of integration period @xmath62 results from a trade - off between maximizing the signal ( @xmath62 large ) and maximizing the angular resolution ( @xmath62 small ) . setting a maximum angular resolution of @xmath91 fixes the integration period to be ( nyquist s theorem ) @xmath92 it turns out that there is little to be gained by setting @xmath91 much larger than 50 ,",
    "so we will take @xmath93 and set @xmath94 s. similar considerations apply to the choice of @xmath2 , which for ligo we will take to be in the range @xmath95 hz .",
    "a plot of the antenna pattern for the cross - correlated pair of ligo detectors is shown in figure 1 for a range of frequencies . as expected",
    ", the antenna pattern has more structure at high frequencies .    now that we have the ligo signal expressed in terms of the general convolution problem of the last section , it is a simple matter to carry through the analysis .",
    "we begin by setting @xmath96 where @xmath97 s is one sidereal day . choosing sky - fixed and earth - fixed coordinate systems with their @xmath98 axes aligned with the earth s rotation axis",
    ", we find the two frames are related : @xmath99 where the bar denotes the earth - fixed frame . from these relations",
    "it follows that @xmath100 and @xmath101 here @xmath102 correspond to the quantities calculated by allen and ottewill .",
    "however , they evaluated @xmath102 in an earth - fixed frame with the @xmath98 axis parallel to the vector connecting the two detectors , @xmath103 .",
    "a static rotation has to be applied to their results before we can use them .",
    "once this is done we can attack the inversion problem @xmath104 where the final line was obtained from the identity @xmath105    at first sight it appears that we have no hope of solving the inversion problem since it involves @xmath106 equations and an infinite number of unknowns .",
    "however , the @xmath102 decay rapidly for large @xmath7 , effectively reducing the number of unknowns . the root - mean - square amplitude of the @xmath102 s",
    ", @xmath107 provides a good estimate of how each order in @xmath7 contributes to the sum in ( [ ligo ] ) . here",
    "@xmath108 is the usual angular power spectrum : @xmath109 plots of @xmath110 for @xmath111 and 200 hz are shown in figure 2 . in each case , the low multipoles dominate the response .",
    "thus , the sum ( [ ligo ] ) can be approximated by @xmath112 where @xmath113 for @xmath114 hz , rising to @xmath115 for @xmath116 hz .",
    "the number of equations is restricted to those with @xmath117 . if we write @xmath118 and use two sets of filters , one with @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and the other with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , then ( [ ligotrunc ] ) can be written as a set of @xmath123 equations for @xmath124 unknowns . as an example , consider the inversion problem at 25 hz , where the system of equations is ( for @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 the above system of 20 equations involves 36 @xmath127 s , making it impossible to solve for each moment individually .",
    "the way around this impasse is to build another interferometer at a different location and to cross - correlate its output with the two ligo detectors , in effect tripling the number of equations .",
    "currently there are several interferometers being built in addition to the ligo pair , including the italian - french virgo detector near pisa , the anglo - german geo detector near hanover , and the japanese tama detector near tokyo .",
    "cross - correlating the signals from all of these detectors will give roughly @xmath128 equations for the @xmath124 unknowns , making it possible to create maps of the gravitational wave background with a resolution as high as @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , the limitation on the resolution will not come from the system being under determined , but from the lack of antenna sensitivity at high @xmath7 .",
    "the procedure for making a map of the gravitational wave sky with the lisa detector is very similar to the procedure we used for the ligo detectors .",
    "currently there are no plans to fly two sets of lisa spacecraft , so we will probably have to make do with the self - correlated signal from a single detector . at first sight",
    "it would appear that correlated noise in the self - correlated signal will prevent us from being able to distinguishing detector noise from a stochastic gravitational wave signal .",
    "however , this turns out not to be the case .",
    "firstly , it is possible to discriminate between detector noise and a stochastic signal by using the sagnac signal that is formed by comparing the phase of a signal that is sent clockwise around the lisa triangle with a signal that is sent counter - clockwise@xcite .",
    "the sagnac signal is very insensitive to gravitational waves , making it the perfect tool for monitoring instrument noise .",
    "secondly , the signal will vary periodically as the detector sweeps across the sky whereas the noise will not .",
    "thus , by making several complete sweeps , it is possible to build up the signal to noise ratio in the measurements of @xmath130 for all @xmath131 .",
    "we study the map making capabilities of a single lisa interferometer and a pair of optimally cross - correlated lisa interferometers .",
    "the optimal cross - correlation is achieved by placing six lisa spacecraft in a circle , with two sets of three spacecraft forming independent interferometers rotated by 90 degrees in the plane of the circle@xcite .",
    "proceeding as we did in the last section , the cross - correlated signal is given by @xmath88 where the luminosity is again given by @xmath89 and the detector response function has the form @xmath132 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\bs   & - & \\frac{t\\delta f q_i}{4\\pi } \\im \\left [ \\sum_{a=+,\\times } f_1^{a}(\\widehat{\\omega},f , t){f_2^{a}}^{*}(\\widehat{\\omega},f , t )      e^{2\\pi i f \\widehat{\\omega}\\cdot\\delta{\\bf x}(t)/c } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the basic expressions are similar for lisa and ligo , the lisa antenna patterns are considerably more complicated : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the detector tensor and @xmath135 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the transfer function@xcite .",
    "the transfer frequency , @xmath136 , corresponds to a wave that just fits inside the interferometer .",
    "the lisa interferometer will have arms of length @xmath137 km .",
    "the antenna pattern sweeps over the sky as the lisa constellation orbits about the sun with period @xmath138 sidereal year . setting @xmath93 fixes the integration period to be @xmath139 s ( roughly three and a half days ) .",
    "choosing sky - fixed and lisa - fixed coordinate systems with their @xmath98 axes normal to the ecliptic gives two frames of reference related by @xmath140 where the bar denotes the lisa - fixed frame .",
    "the complicated scan pattern means that we have to calculate each rotation coefficient @xmath141 individually .",
    "since the coordinate transformation @xmath142 is second order in @xmath143 , the index @xmath144 will run from @xmath145 to @xmath146 . to order @xmath147",
    "the rotation coefficients are : @xmath148    then antenna patterns for a self - correlated lisa detector and an optimally cross - correlated pair of lisa interferometers are shown in figures 3 , 4 and 5 for a range of frequencies in the rest frame of the detectors .",
    "these patterns can be turned into @xmath149 s using the _ healpix _ software package@xcite . in combination with the analytically derived rotation coefficients , @xmath150 , the @xmath149 s yield the @xmath46 s that appear in the deconvolution problem ( [ genconv ] ) . in the low frequency limit , @xmath151 , it is possible to derive the antenna harmonics @xmath149 analytically . for the self - correlated lisa detector",
    "the non - vanishing harmonics at zero frequency are : @xmath152 while for the optimally cross - correlated pair of lisa detectors @xmath153    combined with the rotation coefficients @xmath150 , these give the @xmath154 s that we need to solve the deconvolution problem in the low frequency limit .",
    "for example , the self - correlated lisa detector has @xmath155    thus , at very low frequencies , the inversion problem only involves @xmath156 and multipoles with @xmath157 and @xmath158 , which gives us 17 equations for 15 unknowns .",
    "writing out the convolution problem explicitly reveals that the system is simultaneously under and over constrained .",
    "in other words , some individual multipoles will be very well determined while others can only be given in combination with other multipoles .",
    "once again the degeneracy can be split by building additional detectors that make different antenna sweeps .",
    "alternatively , the lisa constellation could be re - position after several years of data collection into a new orbit that is inclined with respect to the ecliptic .    at higher frequencies the lisa detectors are sensitive to more multipoles .",
    "plots of the root - mean - square amplitude , @xmath110 , of the antenna multipoles @xmath149 are shown in figure 6 for the optimally cross - correlated lisa detectors . by either re - positioning the lisa constellation or by flying multiple constellations at different inclinations",
    ", it will be possible to produce maps with a resolution approaching @xmath159 , which corresponds to an angular resolution of seven degrees .",
