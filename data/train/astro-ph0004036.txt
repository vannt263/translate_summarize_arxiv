    "globular clusters contain many x - ray sources at lower luminosities , @xmath3ergs@xmath4 .",
    "these sources were first discovered with the einstein satellite ( hertz &  grindlay 1983 ) , and many more were found with rosat ( for a compilation , see johnston &  verbunt 1996 ) .",
    "the nature of these low - luminosity sources is the subject of debate , because various types of objects can emit x - rays at such luminosities , such as soft x - ray transients in quiescence , cataclysmic variables , rs  cvn binaries , and recycled neutron stars ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "8 in verbunt et al .",
    "the most compelling identification of a dim x - ray source with an object observed at other wavelengths is the recycled radio pulsar in m28 : the x - ray flux varies on the pulse period ( danner et al .",
    "plausible identifications with cataclysmic variables have been suggested for dim x - ray sources in ngc6397 , ngc6752 , ngc5904 and 47tuc ( cool et al .  1995b , grindlay 1993 , hakala et al .",
    "1997 , verbunt &  hasinger 1998 ) .",
    "these identifications are based on the proximity of the x - ray position to that of a cataclysmic variable , and thus their probability depends on the accuracy of the x - ray position .",
    "the accuracy of the rosat position of a detected x - ray source is determined by two factors : the statistical accuracy of the position of the source on the detector , and the accuracy with which the position of the detector as a whole is projected on the sky . for a sufficient number of photons",
    "the statistical error is less than an arcsecond , but the projection in general has a typical error of @xmath5 .",
    "secure identification of a source in the detector field reduces the error in the projection to the statistical error of the identified source , provided that the optical ( or radio ) position has better accuracy .",
    "only one identification is necessary , because the roll angle of the detector ( i.e.  the north - south direction ) is accurately known ; nonetheless , identification of more than one source is preferable to allow checks on internal consistency . in a globular cluster",
    "the surface density of possible counterparts is so high that chance coincidence usually can not be excluded ; a secure identification can usually be made only for x - ray sources detected well outside the cluster .",
    "this method has been used by verbunt &  hasinger ( 1998 ) to improve the positional accuracy of the sources in the core of 47tuc from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , whereby the area in which the source is expected to lie is reduced sufficiently to exclude several proposed identifications , and increase the probability of others , including two possible cataclysmic variables .    in this paper",
    "we investigate three clusters known to contain multiple dim x - ray sources in their core , which have been observed in long exposures with the rosat hri , and one cluster known to harbour a transient .",
    "we analyse hitherto unpublished observations and detect both previously published and new x - ray sources .",
    "all source positions are checked in the simbad data base versus positions of other objects , and we find objects in the hipparcos or tycho catalogues ( esa 1997 , perryman et al .",

    "1991 ) in combination with the high - resolution imager ( hri , david et al .",
    "the list of the observations is given in table  [ ta ] .",
    "the standard data reduction was done with the extended scientific analysis system ( zimmermann et al .",
    "1996 ) , as follows . to take into account the re - calibration of the pixel size ( hasinger et al .  1998 ) , we multiply the @xmath17 pixel coordinates of each photon with respect to the hri center with 0.9972 . a search for sources",
    "is made by comparing counts in a box with the counts in a ring surrounding it , and by moving this detection box across the image .",
    "the sources thus detected are excised from the image and a background map is made for the remaining photons . a search for sources is then made by comparing the number of photons in a moving box with respect to the number expected on the basis of the background map .",
    "finally , at each position in which a source was found , a maximum - likelihood technique is used to compare the observed photon distribution with the point spread function of the hri ( cruddace et al .",
    "this produces a maximum - likelihood value ml such that the probability that the source is due to chance at one trial position is given by @xmath18 .",
    "we retain sources for further discussion if ml@xmath19 .",
    "( to make sure that all such sources are found , we enter in the maximum likelihood technique all sources that have ml@xmath2010 according to the sliding box searches . )    upper limits at the position of known sources were determined by counting the number @xmath21 of actually detected photons at the position of the source ( and in an area surrounding it corresponding to the uncertainty in the position ) ; we then assign as upper limit the lowest expected number @xmath22 for which the probability of measuring a number @xmath21 or smaller is less than 5%  according to the poisson distribution .",
    "the maximum - likelihood technique also provides an indication whether the source is extended .",
    "if such indication is present , we apply further analysis to test whether the source is a multiple point source .",
    "the further analysis is also based on maximum likelihood techniques , but the analysis is limited to a small area of the detector , near its center .",
    "this allows the simplifications that the background in the analysed area is a constant ( as opposed to a polynomial function of the @xmath17 pixel coordinates ) , and that the point spread function is that for the center of the image ( david et al .",
    "suppose that a model to be tested predicts @xmath23 photons at detector pixel @xmath24 .",
    "the probability that @xmath25 photons are observed is then given by the poisson probability : @xmath26 the probability that the model describes the observations is given by the product of the probabilities for all @xmath24 in the region considered : @xmath27 . for computational ease",
    "we maximize the logarithm of this quantity : @xmath28 the last term in this equation does nt depend on the assumed model , and  in terms of selecting the best model  may be considered as a constant .",
    "thus maximizing @xmath29 is equivalent to minimizing @xmath30 , where @xmath31 if one compares two models a and b , with number of fitted parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 and with likelihoods of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , the difference @xmath36 is a @xmath37 distribution with @xmath38 degrees of freedom , for a sufficient number of photons ( cash 1979 , mattox et al .  1996 ) .",
    "our analysis of possibly multiple sources thus proceeds as follows .",
    "first we compute @xmath39 for a model with constant background and for the best model with background plus one source , and compare it with the @xmath37-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom . if @xmath40 , the presence of one source has a significance more than three sigma .",
    "next we compare the best model with two sources with the best model with one source , to prove the significance of a second source ; the best models with three and two sources to prove the significance of a third source , etc .  until no more significant sources are found .",
    "the addition of one source adds three fitted parameters , one for its number of counts and two for its position . in the case of ngc6397 optical counterparts",
    "have been suggested for three x - ray sources .",
    "for these we also make a fit in which the distances in right ascension and declination between these three sources is fixed to the optically determined values .",
    "the three sources in that case only add five fitted parameters , two for the position of one of them , and three for the fluxes .    to determine the error in a parameter , we start from the best fit value @xmath41 .",
    "we then fix the parameter at @xmath42 and make a new fit , allowing all other parameters to vary . the value of @xmath43 for which @xmath44 increases by 1 is quoted as the 1-sigma error .",

    "the position of x@xmath494a is not compatible with that of id2 .",
    "the reason for this may be seen in fig.[figngca ] : the two brightest components of source x@xmath494/c have a smaller difference in right ascension than id2 and id3 .",
    "if id2 is the correct identification for c3 , we conclude that x@xmath494a is not identical to c3 .    to further investigate this",

    "we fit five sources to the x - ray data of the center of ngc6397 , of which three are forced to be at fixed relative positions , corresponding to the distances between id1 , id2 and id3 .",

    "the @xmath44 of modelii is 26 higher than that of modeli , i.e.  it is a significantly ( 4-sigma ) worse fit .",

    "we assume that id6 of table  2 in cool et al .",

    "this fit has the same @xmath44 as modelii , and thus also is significantly worse than the fit of modeli .",
    "again , the reason for the bad fit is the mismatch in the difference in right ascensions of the two brightest x - ray sources with that between the proposed counterparts : x@xmath494a is not id6 .",
    "we note that the best position of x@xmath494a is between id2 and id6 , and in modeliv we fit six sources , of which four are forced to be at the relative distances of id1 - 3 and id6 .",
    "modeliv thus has three fitted parameters less than modeli .",
    "its @xmath44 is 6 higher than that of modeli , i.e.  it is marginally worse at less than 2-sigma .",
    "the parameters of the six sources of this model are also given in table[taba ] .",
    "it is seen that the positions of x@xmath494b , x@xmath494c and x@xmath494d are the same ( within the error ) in modeliv as in modeli .",

    "we confirm the possible identifications of id3 with c1 ( @xmath76x@xmath494b ) and of id1 with c2 ( @xmath76x@xmath494c ) , and we find one new source ( x@xmath494d ) . in modeli the remaining flux is ascribed to one source ( x@xmath494a ) which is not identical to id2 . in modeliv the remaining flux",
    "is ascribed to two sources , one of which is id2/c3 and one is a second new source , x@xmath494e / id6 .",
    "the two acceptable models are illustrated in fig.[figngcb ] .",
    ".results of fitting four models to the three data sets of ngc6397 .",
    "the table lists the number @xmath21 of fitted parameters , and the difference @xmath39 with respect to the best model for a given data set . in all fits ,",
    "the fluxes of all sources are fitted parameters .",
    "for the 1995 observation modeli has four sources with free positions , modeliv has six sources of which three have free positions and three have fixed positions relative to id3 , corresponding to the offsets of id1 , id2 , and id6 with respect to id3 .",
    "modelsii and iii are as modeliv , after removing id6 and id2 , respectively . for each model ,",
    "the same positions as in the best fit for 1995 are used for the 1991 and 1992 data .",
    "[ tabfit ] [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     with these points in mind , we note from fig.[fxlum ] that in all clusters except possibly @xmath1cen  the most luminous sources appear to be in the cluster core .",
    "the main difference between @xmath1cen  and the other clusters is that the collision frequency in @xmath1cen  is so low that one expects no low - mass x - ray binaries in it , and that most cataclysmic variables in it will be evolved from primordial binaries ( verbunt &  meylan 1988 , davies 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the mass segregation in this cluster is very low .",
    "thus in @xmath1cen  there is no marked difference between the core and the regions outside the core .    in each cluster",
    "we detect sources down to the detection limit ; this suggests that more sensitive observations will detect more sources . in the cores of ngc6397 and",
    "ngc6752 the detection of more source will also require better imaging , so that the faint sources can be detected against the brighter ones .",
    "we do not detect a difference between the luminosities of sources in the collapsed globular cluster ngc6397 and the much less concentrated globular cluster ngc6752 .",
    "on the other hand , the highly concentrated cluster 47  tuc contains three sources which are an order of magnitude brighter than the brightest sources in ngc6397 and ngc6752 .",
    "viable optical counterparts have been suggested for only five among the 26 sources shown in fig.[fxlum ] , all of them probable cataclysmic variables .",
    "we compare the ratio of x - ray flux to optical flux of these sources with the ratios measured for cataclysmic variables and for rs cvn systems in the galactic disk in fig.[fcompa ] .",
    "it is seen that the suggested optical counterparts for the sources in ngc6397 and ngc6752 lead to ratios which are compatible with those of cataclysmic variables , whereas those in 47  tuc are too bright in x - rays , in agreement with fig.[fxlum ] .",
    "if these sources are indeed cataclysmic variables , their excessive x - ray luminosity needs to be explained ; alternatively , the suggested identifications may be chance coincidences ( as discussed by verbunt &  hasinger 1998 ) .",
    "all suggested counterparts lead to higher x - ray to optical flux ratios than those of rs cvn binaries .",
    "the accurate positions that we determine for individual sources are valid for separately detected sources in particular . in the case of overlapping sources , we do not have unique solutions .",
    "thus , in the core of ngc6397 fits with 5 and 6 sources are both acceptable , at similar quality ; and we can not exclude that more sources contribute to the observed flux , which would invalidate our derived positions .",
    "binaries may reside away from the core either because the cluster has undergone little mass segregation , or because a three - body interaction ( i.e.  a close encounter of a binary with a single star ) in the core has expelled the binary from the core ( e.g.  hut et al .",
    "1992 ) . in the latter case",
    "the binary is expected to be eccentric immediately after being expelled ; tidal forces may in time circularize the orbit again .",
    "such binaries are only a minority of the overall binary population of a cluster ; however , x - ray observations may preferably select such binaries if tidal forces act in them . since sources away from the core can be fore- or background sources , optical identification of them is required to settle whether they belong to the cluster or not .",
    "our accurate positions should help in finding such counterparts .",
    "we have made use of the rosat data archive of the max planck institut fr extraterrestrische physik at garching ; of the simbad database operated at centre de donnes astronomiques in strasbourg ; and of the digitized sky surveys . for hipparcos and tycho data",
