    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) have been playing an important role to establish the @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "while vast amount of information is learned by the planck satellite using the temperature anisotropy of the cmb  @xcite , there is a community - wide effort to measure the polarization of cmb to test the inflationary paradigm and to probe the evolution of the universe via interactions between the cmb and gravitational potential from the large scale structures  @xcite .",
    "these paradigms started to be disclosed by the recent results from the cmb polarization experiments , bicep2 , polarbear , and sptpol  @xcite .",
    "forthcoming cmb polarization experiments require a polarimeter that is free from a detector @xmath0 noise and controls the instrument - originated polarization systematic effects .",
    "a polarimeter using a half - wave plate ( hwp ) modulator provides two attractive features , i ) avoiding the detector @xmath0 by modulating and demodulating the signal frequency , and ii ) eliminating the detector differencing , which is a source of the instrumentally induced spurious polarization effect , to reconstruct the incident polarization state  @xcite .",
    "maxipol was the first cmb experiment that employed the continuously rotating hwp .",
    "currently a number of cmb experiments , including abs , ebex , litebird , polarbear-1 , polarbear-2 , qubic , spider , swipe are pursuing this technology  @xcite .    while the use of hwp becomes a popular polarimetry technique , a polarimetry using a single hwp limits the use of the electromagnetic frequency range , and thus the observing detection bandwidth .",
    "the typical available bandwidth with a single hwp is @xmath2 in order to maintain the linear - to - linear polarization conversion efficiency to be more than 0.9 .",
    "upcoming cmb polarization experiments tend to cover the frequency range of @xmath3 or even broader in order to monitor the galactic foreground ( e.g. synchrotron and dust ) emissions .",
    "achromatic hwp ( ahwp ) is introduced by pancharatnam  @xcite and is employed by ebex , the balloon - borne cmb experiment  @xcite .",
    "the stack of the multiple plates with properly chosen offset angles achieves the retardance of @xmath4 broader than @xmath5 .",
    "while this is a very attractive option , one complication with the pancharatnam ahwp is that the amount of angle rotated by the ahwp becomes an electromagnetic frequency dependence .",
    "this effect can be rephrased as the polarization sensitivity axis depends on the instrument bandpass shape and the source spectrum .",
    "when the two or more sources are mixed , the uncertainty of the polarization sensitive angle is not only depending on the spectral shapes but also the relative polarized intensities .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the idea to mitigate the spectral dependence of the polarization angle . in section  2",

    "thus , a polarimeter using ahwp has the intrinsic source of uncertainty in its polarization angle unless one knows the source spectrum to the required precision .",
    "the quantitative discussion about this effect in the context of a cmb polarization experiment can be found in matsumura et al . and bao et al.@xcite .",

    "the similar concept is proposed using alumina with the stycast ar coatings as an ir filter at the cryogenic temperature  @xcite .    in a hwp based polarimetry using a continuous rotation , another possible operational mode is to rotate the two ahwps of the roc - ahwp in opposite directions . in equation  ( [ eq : roc_ahwp_mueller ] ) , one can set @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the angular velocity of the ahwp and @xmath68 is time . in this mode",
