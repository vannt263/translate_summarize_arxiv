    "subject to proper boundary conditions or body forces , elastic materials undergo deformations strongly depending on their shapes . for thin three - dimensional bodies ,",
    "low - energy deformations depend on the shape to such an extent that elastic theories for lower dimensional bodies like rods , plates or shells have been developed ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the rigorous ansatz - free variational derivation of such theories from three - dimensional nonlinear elasticity is a very well established research field . in few words",
    "the problem one aims to solve is the derivation of the elastic energy of a thin object by taking a suitable limit of the elastic energy of the three - dimensional body as its thickness vanishes .",
    "fundamental issues , like the convergence of global minimizers and of critical points in the limit process have been discussed in the literature and a hierarchy of theories depending on the scaling of the energies ( or the forces ) in terms of the thickness has been derived since the pioneering papers by le dret and raoult @xcite and by friesecke , james and mller @xcite by many authors @xcite under different modelling assumptions . + more recently the problem above has gained increasing attention in the case of prestrained bodies .",
    "a number of results have appeared in the case of @xmath1-d to @xmath2-d dimension reduction in @xcite and many interesting questions have been raised .",
    "on one hand the above problem has been left undiscussed in the case of @xmath1-d to @xmath3-d dimension reduction ( see @xcite for a similar problem in the theory of nematic elastomers where the dimension reduction is performed in two subsequent steps @xmath1-d to @xmath2-d and @xmath2-d to @xmath3-d ) , on the other hand recent experiments in @xcite suggest to consider it from a rigorous mathematical point of view . in few words in @xcite the authors take two long strips of elastomer of the same initial width , but unequal length .",
    "the short strip is stretched uniaxially to be equal in length to the longer one .",
    "the initial heights are chosen so that after stretching the bi - strip system has a rectangular cross section .",
    "the two strips are then glued together side - by - side along their length .",
    "the bi - strips appear flat and the initially shorter strip is under a uniaxial prestrain . as a last step of the experiment , the external force needed to stretch the ends of the bi - strip",
    "is gradually released so that the initially flat bi - strip starts to bend and twist out of plane .",
    "it may evolve towards either a helical or hemihelical shape ( more complex structure in which helices with different chiralities seem to periodically alternate ) , depending on the cross - sectional aspect ratio .",
    "in particular , a big enough aspect ratio favors the formation of a helix , whereas a small aspect ratio favors that of a hemihelix .",
    "the analysis in @xcite is simplified first assuming that the system is one - dimensional , so that a kirchhoff - rod approximation is used , and then analyzing stability of configurations close to the straight rod by matching asymptotics in a restricted class of competitors . on one hand",
    "the results appear to be mathematically unsatisfying , on the other hand a rigorous derivation of the complete observed behavior seems to be quite challenging . in this paper",
    "we aim at partially bridging this gap by first providing the 1-d limit theory by gamma - convergence and then proving approximation of isolated local minima of the 1-d energy by local minima of the 3-d energy . in our opinion",
    "the second aspect constitutes the real novelty of this paper together with some second order criteria for strict local minimality of 1-d configurations .",
    "second order criteria for kirchhoff - rod energies already appeared in the literature @xcite but lacking any rigorous relation to the 3-d problem ( see below for other differences between the two approaches ) .",
    "furthermore we make use of our criteria to test the stability of the 1-d straight and helical configurations in terms of critical forces . by means of numerical experiments",
    "we make some rough comparison between our analysis and the experimental results in @xcite .",
    "+ we now detail our setting .",
    "we consider a prestrained thin @xmath1-dimensional stripe subject to terminal loads .",
    "given a small parameter @xmath4 , a stripe of thickness @xmath5 , mid - fiber @xmath6 and cross section @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being a symmetric , smooth enough open set of unit area .",
    "to model the prestrain we introduce a measurable matrix - valued field @xmath10 ( note that here we do not assume any further regularity on @xmath11 as for instance in @xcite as we are interested in discontinuous prestrain to compare our results with the experiments in @xcite ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath12 a portion of the boundary of the beam with positive two - dimensional measure , we consider a force field @xmath13 acting on the beam .",
    "further denoting by @xmath14 $ ] the strain energy density we introduce the total energy of the system stored by a deformation @xmath15 as @xmath16 as usual in the analysis of thin elastic objects , we perform a change of variables to rewrite the energy on a fixed domain .",
    "we set @xmath17 and define the new variable @xmath18 , the rescaled prestrain @xmath19 and force @xmath20 as @xmath21 in terms of the rescaled gradient @xmath22 , the energy can be rewritten as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 we will be interested in the case where @xmath25 suggesting that a meaningful scaling for @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "energies @xmath26 of order @xmath28 correspond to bending flexures and torsions and lead to a rod theory . to prevent the energy functional to be unbounded from below due to the invariance under translations we will further assume @xmath29 for some @xmath30 . under standard frame indifference , non - degeneracy and regularity assumptions on @xmath31 ( see the next section for the precise set of assumptions ) and assuming the rescaled prestrain to be a small perturbation of the identity in the sense of , we consider the @xmath0-limit as @xmath32 of @xmath27 under several boundary conditions comprising clamped and weak clamped beams ( at both ends the beam is free to rotate on a plane orthogonal to a fixed direction as in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that such kind of boundary conditions may involve some additional technical difficulties ( see for instance section [ convisolated ] ) and , to the best of our knowledge , their role in the variational analysis of stability via @xmath0-convergence has not been studied .",
    "the quadratic scaling has been first studied by mora and mller in @xcite in the case @xmath11 is the identity matrix ( see also @xcite ) . under the assumptions above , for such energies one can prove a @xmath0-convergence result and characterize the limit energy density following the same steps as in @xcite . using the notation @xmath33 ,",
    "theorem [ 1dlimit ] shows that the limit energy @xmath34 $ ] is finite on the space @xmath35 where it has the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 being a quadratic function of the entries of @xmath38 which is obtained by a minimization problem involving the quadratic form of linear elasticity ( see proposition [ ondensity ] ) .",
    "+ the formula for @xmath39 can be simplified when the energy density @xmath31 is isotropic .",
    "having in mind the experiments in @xcite , we assume additional symmetry of @xmath9 , covering the case of a rectangular cross section as in the experimental set - up . furthermore we consider a prestrain matrix which describes locally an incompressible deformation ( @xmath40 ) and has a two - layer structure of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the effective strength of the stretching . under this assumptions , in proposition [ curvaturelimit ] we prove that there exist positive coefficients @xmath43 such that , up to an additive constant , the density @xmath44 in is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the intrinsic curvature .",
    "this implies in particular that , without external forces , a uniformly curved beam is a global minimizer ( and actually , up to rotations , the unique global minimizer ) of the limit functional . as a result , by the general theory of @xmath0-convergence , for @xmath5 small enough ,",
    "global minimizers of the energy @xmath26 with zero external forces are close to a curved beam ( see proposition [ curvaturelimit ] and subsequent remarks ) . + the analysis of the convergence of global minimizers has been complemented in literature with results on the convergence of critical points of the @xmath1-d functional to critical points of the @xmath3-d limit energy . for models without prestrain we may mention the papers @xcite , where more regular energy densities are taken into account , or @xcite , for a stronger scaling .",
    "since instead we are also interested in validating the usage of stable states of the one - dimensional limit as approximations of stable states of the three - dimensional energy , we further analyse the problem from the reverse point of view . we namely show that , for a given ( strict ) local minimizer of the 1-d functional in the @xmath47-topology , it exists a sequence of local minimizers of the 3-d one converging to it .",
    "the choice of the topology , as we also discuss in section [ convisolated ] , complies well with simple criteria for showing local minimality , which we also provide .    going into detail , we first prove that , thanks to the quadratic structure of the limit functional @xmath48 , if @xmath49 is a strict local minimizer with respect to the @xmath47-topology , then it is also a strict local minimizer with respect to the @xmath50-topology where it is possible to apply the results in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) about approximation of strict local minima by @xmath0-convergence .",
    "however the advantage of working in @xmath47 ( instead of directly considering @xmath51 ) is that it is possible to characterize local minima of @xmath48 by means of its second variation . to this end in proposition [ variations ]",
    "we compute first and second variations of the functional @xmath48 and eventually prove in theorem [ mainlocal ] that if the second variation of @xmath48 at a critical point @xmath49 is a positive - definite quadratic form , then @xmath49 is a strict local minimizer in @xmath50 .",
    "we remark that we do not use euler angles to rewrite @xmath48 in contrast to @xcite . on one hand",
    "this makes our problem mathematically more complicated since the domain of our energy functional is not a linear space , on the other we gain in generality since we have to pose no a - priori restrictions to the configurations in order to avoid polar singularities .",
    "it is worth noticing that the proof of our local minimality criterion is simplified by the possibility of extending the limit energy functional @xmath52 in a neighborhood of @xmath53 to a functional @xmath54 twice continuously frchet - differentiable in @xmath47 .",
    "such a strong property is a consequence of two facts : the quadratic dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath56 and its smooth dependence on @xmath57 .",
    "the first is due to the quadratic structure of the limit energy while the second to the dimensionality of the problem : being @xmath54 defined on one - dimensional @xmath47 functions , sobolev embeddings give @xmath58-compactness for @xmath57 which turns out to provide a smooth dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath57 ( see lemma [ frechetdiff ] ) .",
    "+ in the last section of the paper we investigate the local stability of straight and helical configurations under terminal loads .",
    "a similar problem , with the already discussed restrictions and in absence of prestrain , appeared in @xcite . in theorem [ idstable ]",
    "we compute a critical value ( explicitly depending on the boundary conditions ) @xmath59 of the terminal load @xmath60 such that , for @xmath61 the straight configuration is a @xmath50 local minimizer , while for @xmath62 it is not .",
    "this result also enable us to prove that the straight configuration is the unique global minimizer of @xmath48 for sufficiently large loads @xmath63 .",
    "a stability analysis , based on a conjugate point method , is performed in section [ stabhel ] for helical solutions .",
    "the results of this section are also exploited to provide numerical evidence of some of the experimentally observed behavior of the physical model in @xcite . at the critical force , under some condition on the parameters of the problem , helical solutions arbitrarily close at the origin to the straight configuration emerge as a branch of local minima of the energy @xmath48 with respect to their own boundary conditions . if instead the same boundary conditions are kept , both in the clamped - clamped and in the weak - clamped case , theorem [ bifurcation ] shows that for @xmath64 there exist a branch of critical points bifurcating from the identity .    the last part of the paper is devoted to simple numerical experiments in which we show that two factors can influence the stability of helical solutions , namely the aspect ratio of the rectangular cross section and the intrinsic curvature of the rod through the prestrain parameter @xmath65 in .",
    "we denote by @xmath66 the standard basis in @xmath67 , by @xmath68 the set of all real - valued @xmath69 matrices and by @xmath70 the identity matrix . given a matrix @xmath57 we denote by @xmath71 its adjoint matrix (",

    "we will consider a prestrained thin @xmath1-dimensional stripe . given a small parameter @xmath4 , a stripe of thickness @xmath5 , mid - fiber @xmath6 and cross section @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "on @xmath9 we will assume that it is a bounded open connected set having unitary area and lipschitz boundary .",
    "we moreover assume that @xmath9 satisfies the following symmetry properties :    @xmath87    the prestrain is defined as a measurable matrix - valued field @xmath10 .",
    "we require the orientation preserving condition @xmath88 we consider a hyperelastic material and assume a multiplicative decomposition for the strain ( see @xcite ) . denoting by @xmath14 $ ] the strain energy density ,",

    "in addition to the stored energy we want to consider an external boundary force of the type described below . given a portion @xmath12 with @xmath95 and a force field @xmath13",

    "can be also considered and will be discussed in section [ sect - boundary ] , namely    * * clamped * : @xmath100 * * clamped - clamped * : in addition to it also holds @xmath101    we will see in corollary [ convbc ] that the above constraints will imply dirichlet boundary conditions for the limit strains . + a weaker constraint , which we call * weak clamping * ( at one or both ends ) has been also considered in literature ( see for instance @xcite ) . in this case one",
    "leaves the ends free to rotate in the plane orthogonal to a fixed direction .",
    "assuming for simplicity this direction to be @xmath102 and considering the more general case of a weak clamping at both ends , it amounts to requiring    @xmath103    the analysis of the energy @xmath26 will entail bending and torsion effects as a result of the @xmath104 scaling .",
    "accordingly , in order to obtain a proper limiting theory as the thickness @xmath5 tends to zero , we assume throughout this paper that the rescaled prestrain is a ( not necessarily smooth ) perturbation of the identity in the following sense : @xmath105 for some @xmath106 .",
    "note that these assumptions already imply ( [ invertible ] ) if @xmath4 is small enough .",
