    "on the basis of the exact equations of motion for the single - particle green s function @xmath0 and condensate wave function,@xcite it was shown in a previous paper@xcite that the poles of the two - particle green s function @xmath2 in an interacting bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) are generally not shared with those of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that there may be multiple excitation branches even in a single - component bec , contrary to the widely accepted viewpoint of attributing a unique phonon branch due to density fluctuations.@xcite hence , it is desirable to clarify the basic properties of the poles of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . here , we will perform it in terms of goldstone s theorem@xcite based on a self - consistent perturbation expansion that simultaneously satisfies goldstone s theorem and conservation laws.@xcite    goldstone s theorem on spontaneously broken continuous symmetry has crucial importance over a wide range of fields in modern theoretical physics . according to a recent review,@xcite",
    "it is considered to predict a single massless mode called the nambu - goldstone boson for the single - component bec with broken @xmath1 symmetry . since the mode is expected to dominate the thermodynamic properties of the bec , clarifying the basic properties of the nambu - goldstone boson(s ) forms an essential prerequisite to any theoretical investigations of the bec . in this connection , it should be pointed out that basic proofs of goldstone s theorem were given by goldstone , salam , and weinberg ( gsw ) mainly in two different ways.@xcite we will show that they may be relevant to distinct massless modes in general , contrary to the standard treatment@xcite where no explicit distinction between the proofs seems to have been made .    the main results of the present paper are summarized as follows . for the single - component bec ,",
    "the two proofs by gsw @xcite are relevant to the poles of different green s functions .",

    "on this point .",
    "we will show , however , that it is essentially a `` bubbling '' mode with a short lifetime , i.e. , a mode that fluctuates temporally out of and back into the condensate , originating from an `` improper '' structure of the self - energy inherent in the bec . to put it another way ,",
    "the first mode of the bec is not a well - defined `` quasi - particle '' ( `` particle '' ) in the terminology of condensed matter ( particle ) physics .",
    "both the improper structure of the self - energy and the resultant bubbling feature of the first mode have escaped consideration so far and will be studied in detail .",
    "they also have the effect of removing infrared singularities pointed out by gavoret and nozires;@xcite hence @xmath2 , for example , can be calculated safely without any artificial procedures .",
