    "secondary beam experiments are opening up new physics to be studied for a variety of unstable nuclei across the beta - stability line in the nuclear chart .",
    "one of the basic questions is to study their charge and matter deformations .",
    "we are especially interested in the difference between the charge and matter deformations in each unstable nucleus .",
    "one can not , however , apply the standard techniques such as the gamma ray spectroscopy which have been used for stable nuclei .",
    "a possibility is to use heavy - ion fusion reactions at energies below or near the coulomb barrier , which have recently been established to be very sensitive to the shape of the target and/or projectile nuclei @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to predict the charge and matter deformations theoretically based on the non - relativistic hartree fock or the relativistic mean field calculations with various refinements such as including the pairing correlations .    in this paper , we take na isotopes as an example to anticipate the variation of the charge and matter deformations along an isotope chain and discuss whether the significant difference between them expected for some isotopes can be probed through the analysis of the fusion reactions induced by them by assuming @xmath1pb as the target nucleus .",
    "we use the relativistic mean field calculations to assess the charge and matter deformations for each na isotope .",
    "we then calculate the fusion cross section @xmath2 based on the coupled - channels formalism assuming thus obtained values of deformations and taking the ground state rotational band into account .",
    "we then calculate the associated so called fusion barrier distribution @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we describe the formalism of our coupled - channels calculations , i.e. the simplified framework based on the no - coriolis approximation , somewhat in detail , because the formalism is not well known for the case of fusion of a deformed odd mass projectile which we are going to discuss in this paper . in sect .",
    "3 , we present the results of the relativistic mean field calculations and of the coupled - channels analyses .",
    "the paper is summarized in sect.4 .",
    "we discuss in the next section the fusion of deformed odd mass na isotopes with @xmath1pb target .",
    "we calculate the fusion cross section by taking the excitation of the ground state rotational band of the na projectile into account with the coupled - channels formalism in the no - coriolis approximation . in this section",
    ", we describe the major aspects of the method .",
    "we denote the coordinates of the relative motion between the projectile and target nuclei and of the rotational motion of the projectile , i.e. a na isotope , by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we ignore the intrinsic excitation of @xmath1pb .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 @xmath8 is the sum of monopole nuclear and coulomb interactions between the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "we call it the bare interaction .",
    "@xmath9 is the intrinsic hamiltonian of each na projectile , whose eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues are denoted as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 we assume that each deformed na isotope can be well described by the strong coupling model @xcite for the rotational excitation , where the wave function is given by @xmath13 on the r.h.s . of eq.([iwf ] ) , we used @xmath14 for @xmath15 in order to explicitly indicate the physical meaning as the euler angles",

    "we assume the deformation to be axially symmetric , and k is the component of the angular momentum of the rotational motion along the symmetry axis .",

    "we assume the same form of coupling hamiltonian as that is familiar in coupled - channels calculations for the fusion reactions of even - even nuclei .",
    "it consists of the nuclear and coulomb parts , and is expressed as @xmath18 in terms of the spherical harmonics for the relative motion and the tensor operators @xmath19 which cause the rotational excitation of the na projectile .",
    "we further assume the latter to be given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the deformation parameters in the body fixed frame @xcite .",
    "we have kept only the @xmath22 term to be consistent with the assumption of the axially symmetric deformation .",
