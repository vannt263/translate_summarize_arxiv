    "in this paper we shall study the dynamics of one or more self - gravitating spherical shells of matter subject to a centrally symmetric gravitational field and the application of the ensuing formalism to the semiclassical treatment of hawking radiation .",
    "such field of research was started by the papers by kraus and wilczek @xcite .",
    "the main results we shall report here are the extension of the treatment to one massive shell of matter and also the extension to two or more massive shells of matter which in the time development can also intersect @xcite .",
    "the main appeal of the approach of @xcite is that energy conservation is taken exactly into account and thus the back reaction effects can be computed .",
    "we shall keep the formalism for more that one shell as close as possible to the original formalism of @xcite which can be summarized in words that we shall adopt a painlev gauge .",
    "the extraction of the reduced hamiltonian is often classified as a very complicated procedure .",
    "we shall show that by introducing a `` generating function '' the derivation can be drastically simplified and also by the same token it can be extended to deal not only with massive shells but also with a finite number of massive shells .",
    "the treatment of massless shells is just a particular case .    in sec.[reducedsec ]",
    "we shall give the derivation of the reduced action in the case of one shell while proving the independence of the canonical momentum within the painlev class of gauges .",
    "in sec.[eqmotionsec ] we shall discuss the equations of motion . in sec.[analyticsec",
    "] we work out the analytic properties of the conjugate momentum @xmath0 which appears in the reduced action and in sec.[twoshellsec ] we shall briefly describe the extension of the treatment to more than one shell .",
    "an application of the results is given in sec.[exchangesec ] giving a derivation within such a formalism of the dray-t hooft- redmount exchange relations .",
    "an important integrability relation is reported in sec.[integrabilitysec ] which allows to compute the imaginary part of the space integral of the canonical momenta for two shells . in sec.[modesec ] we revisit the role of the imaginary part of the canonical momentum in determining the bogoliubov coefficients and thus the most important features of hawking radiation . in sec.[conclusionsec ] we give some concluding remarks .",
    "as usual we write the metric for a spherically symmetric configuration in the adm form @xmath1 were following @xcite we shall choose the functions @xmath2 as continuous functions of the coordinates .",
    "we shall work on a finite region of space time @xmath3 .",
    "on the two initial and final surfaces we give the intrinsic metric by specifying @xmath4 and @xmath5 and similarly @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the complete action in hamiltonian form , boundary terms included is @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 is the shell position and @xmath11 its canonical conjugate momentum . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the constraints @xmath14 @xmath15 action ( [ completeaction ] ) is immediately generalized to a finite number of shells .",
    "the shell action as given by eqs.([shellaction],[constraintr],[constraintt ] ) refers to a dust shell even though generalizations to more complicated equations of state have been considered @xcite .",
    "the boundary terms are those given in the paper by hawking and hunter @xcite and will play a very important role in the following .",
    "the function @xmath16 @xcite @xmath17 has the remarkable property of generating the conjugate momenta as solutions of the constraints as follows @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a mass which is constant in @xmath21 except at the shell position @xmath10 and that we shall denote by @xmath22 for @xmath21 above all the shell positions and by @xmath23 for @xmath21 below all the shell positions .",
    "we shall adopt a painlev gauge defined by @xmath24 everywhere .",
    "with regard to the remaining freedom in the choice of the gauge we shall choose @xmath25 except for a deformation region near the shell positions .",
    "such deformation is unavoidable because the constraints impose a discontinuity in the derivative @xmath26 at @xmath27 as we shall see in the following . in the painlev gauges @xmath16",
    "becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 where we exploited the freedom of adding to ( [ fgeneral ] ) a total derivative , thus gaining for @xmath16 the useful property of vanishing wherever @xmath31 . for @xmath24 eqs.([pilfromf],[pirfromf ] ) become @xmath32}{w}.\\ ] ]    with regard to @xmath33 one can choose several gauges , within the painlev family .",
    "inner gauge ]    inner gauge ]    generic gauge ]    typical are the `` outer gauge '' characterized by @xmath34 for @xmath35 and shown in fig.[outer ] and the inner gauge characterized by @xmath34 for @xmath36 shown in fig.[inner ] , but there are also more general choices as shown in fig.[generic ] . we stress that such deformation @xmath37 is not related to the thickness of the shell which is always zero .    using the solutions ( [ pilfromf],[pirfromf ] ) of the constraints one obtains in the outer gauge the following reduced @xcite action where only the shell position @xmath10 appears as degree of freedom @xmath38 the @xmath0",
    "is easily computed @xmath39 where @xmath40 and similarly for @xmath41 . in deriving eq.([pcgeneral ] ) we used the consequences of the constraints ( [ constraintr],[constraintt ] ) @xmath42 in the outer gauge we find @xmath43 with @xmath11 given implicitly by @xmath44 this is the result obtained by friedman , louko , winters - hilt @xcite through a limit procedure in which the support of the deformation function goes to zero but actually it is independent of the deformation . for working out the dynamics of one shell",
    "the limit procedure is all right , but in dealing with two or more shell it is important to have a deformation on a finite range because otherwise a limit procedure would give a result dependent on the order in which the two limits , deformation and @xmath45 , are taken .",
    "similarly one can compute using the general formula the reduced canonical momentum of the system in the inner gauge @xmath46 and @xmath11 , again determined by the discontinuity equation ( [ disceq ] ) , is given now by the implicit equation @xmath47 the two reduced canonical momenta @xmath48 appear to be completely different but they can be proven to be the same function of @xmath10 .",
    "one can consider also the more general gauges depicted in fig.3 and it can be proven @xcite that @xmath0 is always the same .",
    "however in inner gauge a term @xmath49 appears in the reduced action while in the more general gauges both a term @xmath50 and a term @xmath51 appear in the action .",
    "the boundary term given in eq.([completeaction ] ) is equivalent to @xmath52",
    "in deriving the equation of motion from action ( [ outerreducedaction ] ) one can consider @xmath53 , the interior mass , as a datum of the problem and vary @xmath22 to obtain @xmath54 which using the expression of @xmath0 and the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 imposed by the gravitational equations @xcite can be written as @xmath57 alternatively one can consider @xmath22 , the total energy as a datum of the problem and vary @xmath58 .",
    "the calculation is far more complicated due to the presence of @xmath50 in the action ( [ outerreducedaction ] ) , but using the equations for the gravitational field one reaches @xcite the same equation of motion ( [ 1sheqmotion ] ) .",
    "in addition a consequence of the gravitational equations of motion is the constancy in time of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we saw that in the outer gauge @xmath0 is given by ( [ pc],[fundamentalh ] ) .",
    "the solution of eq.([fundamentalh ] ) for @xmath11 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 if we want @xmath11 to describe an outgoing shell we must choose the plus sign in front of the square root .",
    "moreover the shell reaches @xmath62 if and only if @xmath63 as expected .",
    "the logarithm in @xmath0 , eq.([pc ] ) , has branch points at zero and infinity and thus we must investigate for which values or @xmath10 such values are reached . at @xmath64 , @xmath11 has a simple pole with positive residue .",
    "thus the numerator in the argument of the logarithm in @xmath0 goes to zero and below @xmath65 it becomes @xmath66 where here @xmath67 is the absolute value of the square root .",
    "expression ( [ contnumerator ] ) is negative irrespective of the sign of @xmath11 and stays so for @xmath68 because @xmath11 is no longer singular . as a consequence @xmath0 below @xmath65 acquires the imaginary part @xmath69 . below @xmath70 the denominator of the argument of the logarithm in eq.([pc ] )",
    "becomes negative so that the argument of the logarithm reverts to positive values .",
    "thus the so called classically forbidden region where @xmath0 becomes complex is @xmath71 independent of @xmath72 and of the deformation @xmath37 and the integral of the imaginary part of @xmath0 for any deformation @xmath37 and for any mass @xmath72 of the shell is @xmath73 which is the original result derived in @xcite in the zero mass case .",
    "parikh and wilczek @xcite gave to @xmath74 the interpretation of the tunneling probability for the emission of a quantum of energy @xmath75 .",
    "criticism and alternative proposals for the emission probability like @xmath76 @xmath77 followed @xcite . here instead we shall discuss the role of eq.([pc ] ) in the framework of mode analysis .",
    "this will be done in sec.([modesec ] ) .",
    "two shell dynamics ]    now we have three characteristic masses , @xmath23 , @xmath22 and an intermediate mass @xmath78 , see fig.4 , which can change only if the two shells cross . working as before with @xmath79 considered as a datum of the problem",
    "we reach the reduced action @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is given by eq.([pc ] ) with @xmath23 replaced by @xmath78 .",
    "the novelty is that now even in the outer gauge the time derivative of @xmath22 intervenes in addition to @xmath83 and @xmath84 and @xmath85 depend both on @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we can vary @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath22 and @xmath78 independently obtaining the correct equations of motion @xcite . as expected",
    "one finds that the exterior shell moves irrespective of the dynamics which develops at lower values of @xmath21 until a crossing occurs .",
    "in case of crossing of the two shells from the equations of sec.([twoshellsec ] ) we can obtain relations between @xmath88 and @xmath89 being @xmath90 the the shell position at the crossing and @xmath89 the intermediate mass after the crossing . during the crossing the masses of the shells can change ,",
    "provided they satisfy a relation analogous to the energy - momentum conservation is special relativity @xmath91 this is an outcome of the constraints .",
    "it is not possible to predict the final masses of the two shells as it depends on the details of the interaction which has to be specified .",
    "a relatively simple case is when the masses are unchanged during the crossing ( transparent crossing ) @xcite and the simplest case is the crossing of two massless shells which remain massless , thus re - obtaining the well known dray-t hooft - redmount relations @xcite which we report here below @xmath92 being @xmath90 the crossing radius .",
    "the exchange diagram ]",
    "the space - part of the on - shell action for two massive shells of matter is given from eq.([twoshellreducedaction ] ) by @xmath94 as on the equations of motion @xmath95 .",
    "it is possible to prove a theorem analogous to the one found in the books of whittaker and arnold @xcite i.e. that in presence of a constant of motion , in addition to the hamiltonian , the form @xmath96 is closed even though the proof is somewhat different @xcite .",
    "the intermediate mass @xmath78 plays the role of the additional constant of motion .",
    "the above result allows to deform the integration path as to bring @xmath97 immediately below or above @xmath87 .",
    "this is allowed by the absence of discontinuities in our scheme .",
    "but , in words , two coaleshed shell have the same properties of a single shell with energy @xmath98 .",
    "the final result is that @xmath99 the result ( [ intpc1pc2 ] ) holds also for in the case when at the crossing the two shells can change their mass .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "the original way to extract information on the spectrum of the radiation is mode analysis @xcite . in the massless case @xmath100",
    "can be computed exactly and its expansion to first order in @xmath101 is @xmath102 given the semiclassical mode @xmath103 we can perform the analysis of the mode regular at the horizon in terms of the above mode .",
    "this analysis can be performed either by scalar product @xcite i.e. space integration where one has to keep into account that the background metric is painlev or by time fourier analysis . in this way one",
    "obtains the well known formulas for the bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "the regular outgoing modes near the horizon are given by @xmath104 computing the scalar product , and taking into account that the background metric is the painlev metric , we have @xmath105 with @xmath106 and the integration region is outside the horizon . keeping only the most singular terms at the horizon eq.([scalarproduct ] )",
    "reduces , with @xmath107 , to @xmath108 we can compute such scalar products at @xmath109 obtaining the standard hawking integral @xmath110 which gives the dominant contribution for large @xmath111 . the coefficient @xmath112 is obtained by changing in ( [ alphakomega ] ) @xmath75 into @xmath113 .",
    "alternatively we can extract the bogoliubov coefficients by performing a time fourier transform i.e. @xmath114 which is , as it should be , a result independent of @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath115 ) and reproduces eq.([alphakomega ] ) .",
    "the derivation is valid to first order in @xmath75 which is the realm of validity of the external field approximation . for finite @xmath75",
    "it is problematic to perform a space integration on modes , because we have not a well defined background metric .",
    "thus kraus and wilczek @xcite followed the time fourier analysis method . in order to do",
    "so one has to construct the non - perturbative modes regular at the horizon .",
    "this is not a completely trivial task .",
    "the regular modes are given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the on shell action computed with the following boundary conditions : 1 ) at time @xmath118 the shell position is @xmath10 , outside the horizon .",
    "2 ) at time @xmath109 the conjugate momentum is @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath119 . due to these boundary conditions @xmath120 , @xmath22 and as a consequence @xmath0 depend on @xmath121 even if along each trajectory @xmath22 is always a constant of motion . using the saddle point approximation @xcite one obtains that the absolute value of the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 computed for @xmath124 .",
    "what is important here is that only the space part of the action appears , as the time part @xmath125 cancels with @xmath126 at the saddle point .",
    "@xmath120 is given by the condition @xmath127 which for @xmath128 is solved by @xmath129 and thus there is no imaginary contribution to the integral from the gap @xmath130 as we discussed in sect.([analyticsec ] ) .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath112 is obtained by changing in ( [ kvkintegral ] ) @xmath75 in @xmath113 ( always @xmath131 ) . then we have @xmath132 the value of the saddle point @xmath118 , now complex , is given by @xmath133 and the r.h.s .",
    "term of eq.([kvkintegral ] ) becomes @xmath134 where the last passage is due to eq.([integratedimpart ] ) for which we gave a general proof within the family of painlev gauges even in the massive case .",
    "an explicit derivation of the result ( [ correctedbeta ] ) has been given in @xcite by working out the late time expansion of the time development of the action .",
    "the main point is that in the mode analysis what comes in is not the total action of a model particle crossing the horizon , but only the `` space part '' of it .",
    "the analysis and the results depend on the interpretation of the expression @xmath135 as modes of the field dressed by the gravitational interaction with non vanishing quanta of energy .",
    "the result eq.([intpc1pc2 ] ) proven for the emission of two shells @xcite was interpreted @xcite as the absence of correlations among quanta in the emitted radiation .",
    "it would be of interest to give a similar `` mode interpretation '' of the result ( [ intpc1pc2 ] ) derived for the emission of two shells which during the time evolution can also interact @xcite . to this end",
    "one should compute the two shell modes which are regular at the horizon , and perform a time fourier analysis of them .",
    "this has not yet been accomplished .",
    "in this paper we gave a general treatment of the dynamics of one or more self- gravitating spherical shell of matter in a spherical gravitational field .",
    "we extended the treatment of @xcite to more than one shell @xcite proving on the way the universality of the reduced conjugate momentum within the family of painlev gauges @xcite .",
    "this allows to give a general derivation of the exchange relations and also , exploiting an integrability result , to extend the result on the imaginary part of the space part of the action to more than one shell .",
    "instead of following the tunneling picture here we have revisited the treatment which follows by interpreting the exponential of the action , properly subtracted , as the dressed modes of the hawking radiation .",
    "the main point here is that according such a mode interpretation only the space part of the action and in particular its imaginary part comes in determining the bogoliubov coefficient and thus in determining the hawking spectrum corrected for the back reaction effects .",
