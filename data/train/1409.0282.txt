    "few - body problems play many important roles in the study of cold atom gases , partly due to the diluteness condition which is generally fulfilled in the underlying systems .",
    "one of the most important examples is that few - body results , which can be numerically exact , can provide benchmark and calibration of many - body theories , where approximations are usually inevitable .",
    "for instance , in the study of bec - bsc crossover of a fermi superfluid around a feshbach resonance , the mean - field theory yields that the scattering length between fermion pairs ( or dimers ) equals @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the scattering length between fermionic particles @xcite .",
    "however , a precise four - body calculation gives a result of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this significant deviation suggests that it is necessary to include pair fluctuations in order to obtain a more accurate many - body description .",
    "indeed , pair fluctuation theory can reduce this dimer scattering length to @xmath3 @xcite , which is much closer to the few - body result .",
    "moreover , experimental measurements of interaction energy have confirmed the prediction from few - body calculation @xcite .",
    "recently , the ens group has realized the first mixture of bose and fermi superfluids with bosonic @xmath4li and two spin components of @xmath5li @xcite . to reach fermi superfluid ,",
    "the magnetic field has to be tuned around a feshbach resonance between two fermionic components . in this regime",
    "all other interaction parameters are small .",
    "for instance , in this experiment the boson - fermion scattering length @xmath6 is only @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the bohr radius ) .",
    "with such a weak interaction between bosons and fermions , one may expect that the interaction energy between bose and fermi superfluids can be obtained by mean - field theory quite accurately .",
    "in fact , such a mean - field and hydrodynamic theory treatment have been used in analyzing this system @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide a calibration of this mean - field theory from few - body calculation of atom - dimer scattering length .",
    "considering the situation that boson - fermion scattering length @xmath6 is independent of fermionic spin species ( as in the current experiment ) , boson - fermion interaction is described by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are creation operators for bosons and fermions with spin @xmath12 or @xmath13 , respectively , and @xmath14 is the reduced mass of the boson and fermion . with hartree - fock mean - field decomposition , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , this interaction energy density",
    "is naturally given by @xmath17    on the other hand , on the bec side of the resonance , the fermi superfluid can be viewed as a bose condensate of dimers . the interaction energy between bose and fermi superfluids",

    ", it is found that even for weak boson - fermion interaction where @xmath27 is only a few percent ( for instance , for typical fermion density @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and when @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , the difference between outcomes of three - body calculation and mean - field approach can be as large as @xmath32 - @xmath33 , depending on the mass ratio of boson to fermion .",
    "our results give a correction to mean - field interaction energy on the bec side of the fermionic feshbach resonance , and can be verified by a frequency shift of collective dipole oscillation , as done in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the atom - dimer scattering length can be obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the system composed of a bosonic atom and two fermionic atoms with different spins .",
