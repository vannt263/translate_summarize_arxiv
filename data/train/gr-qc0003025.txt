    "it is often ( mistakenly ) believed that every kind of matter , on scales in which we do not need to consider its quantum features , has an energy density that is everywhere positive .",
    "( in fact , we could think on this property as defining what we understand by classical matter ) .",
    "this is more precisely stated by saying that every type of classical matter satisfies the energy conditions of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "there are several ( pointwise ) energy conditions requiring that various linear combinations of the components of the energy - momentum tensor of matter have positive values .",
    "( or at the very least , non - negative values . ) among them , we will be particularly interested in the null energy condition ( nec ) because it is the weakest one : if the nec is violated all pointwise energy conditions would be violated  @xcite .",
    "now , if we assume that the energy conditions are satisfied by every kind of classical matter , general relativity leads to many powerful classical theorems .",
    "the singularity theorems  @xcite , the positive mass theorem  @xcite , the superluminal censorship theorem  @xcite , the topological censorship theorem  @xcite , certain types of no - hair theorem  @xcite , and various constraints on black hole surface gravity  @xcite , all make use of some type of energy condition . as an illustration of the importance of these results ,",
    "the conclusion regarding the inevitability of the appearance of singularities  @xcite , has been ( for the last thirty years ) one of the central pillars from which many investigations in general relativity start .",
    "( additional powerful technical assumptions are also needed for the singularity theorems to apply ; see  @xcite for a critical review ) . in this regard ,",
    "the alleged impossibility of the existence of traversable wormholes connecting different spatial regions of the universe  @xcite , a topic in which we will be particularly interested in this paper , could be seen as a complementary way of phrasing that conclusion ( of course , one should not carry this parallelism too far ) .    assuming the positivity of the energy density implies that spacetime geometries containing traversable wormholes are ruled out of the classical realm .",
    "specifically , the topological censorship theorem  @xcite states that if the averaged null energy ( anec ; the nec averaged over a complete null geodesic ) is satisfied , then there can not be any topological obstruction ( , a wormhole ) inside any asymptotically flat spacetime . in agreement with this result , a purely local analysis by david hochberg and one of the present authors",
    "@xcite shows that the violation of nec on or near the throat of a traversable wormhole is a generic property of these objects .",
    "for this reason most of the investigations regarding traversable wormholes tend to view these objects as semiclassical in nature , using the expectation value of the quantum operator associated with the energy - momentum tensor as the source of gravity  @xcite .    however , it is easy to demonstrate that an extremely simple and apparently quite innocuous classical field theory , a scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity ( that is , with a non - vanishing coupling to the scalar curvature ) , can violate the nec and even the anec  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , some of the other energy conditions can be violated even by minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "there exist other classical systems that exhibit nec violations , such as brans ",
    "dicke theory  @xcite , higher derivative gravity  @xcite or gauss  bonnet theory  @xcite , but they are all based on modifications of general relativity at high energies . it is the simplicity of the scalar field theory that particularly attracted our attention .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we analyzed a massless scalar field conformally coupled to gravity ( that is , we used the special value @xmath2 ) and found that among the classical solutions for the system there exists an entire branch of traversable wormholes .",
    "the case of conformal coupling has many interesting features and , in fact , it seems the most natural behaviour for a scalar field at low energies  @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we want to point out that assuming conformal coupling is not the critical issue , and that it is only the fact of non - minimality ( more precisely , positive curvature coupling @xmath0 ) that is important for traversable wormhole solutions to exist",
    ". we have found general expressions for the classical solutions of gravity plus a massless non - minimally coupled scalar field . in particular , we have found a sub - class of traversable wormhole solutions for the entire range @xmath3 . in our solutions , apart from the geometry , there is also a scalar field that modifies the effective newton constant .",
    "we will not address here the possible effects of this scalar field on the journey of any hypothetical traveller trying to cross the wormhole throat .    in the next section we will review the possibilities that scalar fields offer to violate the different energy conditions .",
    "( that scalar fields might potentially cause problems in this regard was first noted at least 25 years ago  @xcite , and is an issue that has periodically come in and out of focus since then  @xcite . ) then we will obtain and describe the classical solutions for gravity plus a non - minimally coupled massless scalar field , restricting to static and spherically symmetric configurations . among these solutions",
    "there are an assortment of naked singularities but we also find an entire branch of traversable wormhole solutions for curvature coupling @xmath0",
    ". we will leave it to section [ s : wormhole ] to analyze these traversable wormhole geometries in detail .",
    "finally , in section [ s : discussion ] we will discuss the key features of these solutions and the plausibility with which they might actually be produced in nature , based on the role of scalar fields in modern theoretical physics and the totality of the experimental constraints arising from both particle physics and gravity physics .",
    "when a classical scalar field acts as a source of gravity , many of the energy conditions can be violated depending on the form of the scalar potential and the value of the curvature coupling .",

    "the symbol @xmath7 represents essentially the inverse of newton s constant , @xmath8 .",
    "these equations can be obtained by varying the einstein ",

    "however , for @xmath27 it can be violated in a number of ways : for @xmath28 any local minimum of @xmath29 violates the nec while for @xmath30 and @xmath31 small , [ meaning @xmath32 , any local maximum of @xmath29 violates the nec . finally for @xmath30 and @xmath31 large , [ meaning @xmath33 , roughly corresponding to super ",

    "at this point it is worth noticing that , because our analysis is completely classical , it is _ a priori _ conceivable that averaged versions of the energy conditions ( averaged over a geodesic ) could in principle be as easily violated as their pointwise counterparts . in particular , anec violations , critical for traversable wormhole configurations to be able to exist ,",
    "could in principle be as easy to find as nec violations , and it is to exploring this possibility that we now turn .",

    "thus we have seen that a rather simple and apparently quite harmless scalar field theory can in many cases violate all the energy conditions .",
    "violating all the pointwise energy conditions is particularly simple , and violating the averaged energy conditions , though more difficult , is still generically possible . in the next section",
    "we shall exhibit some specific examples of this phenomenon in the form of exact solutions to the coupled einstein  scalar - field equations . in the final section",
    "we will discuss the extent to which these exact solutions are realistic : we shall discuss the generic role played by scalar fields in modern theoretical physics , and the experimental / observational limits on their existence and behaviour in order to address the physical plausibility of these energy condition violations .",
    "as we have just seen , a non - minimally coupled scalar field can violate , in some circumstances , the nec and even the anec .",
    "this opens up the possibility of finding some traversable wormholes among the many geometries that can be supported by a classical non - minimally coupled scalar field . that this is in fact the case for a massless conformally coupled scalar field was shown in  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we will see that even for non - conformal coupling ( curvature coupling different from @xmath49 ) , but positive , we can also find traversable wormholes . in this section",
    "we will obtain the classical solutions for gravity plus a generic non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "for simplicity , we will restrict to the spherically symmetric and static configuration and will take the scalar potential @xmath50 equal zero .",
    "( to add a particle mass to the scalar field complicates the equations sufficiently to preclude the possibility of analytic results ) .",
    "the first thing that we realize is that for any spatially constant value of the scalar field , @xmath51 , the einstein equations reduce to @xmath52 . by looking also at the scalar field equation @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the ricci scalar curvature",
    ", we can straightforwardly find a variety of trivial solutions for this system . for ( i ) @xmath0 and @xmath55 , or ( ii ) @xmath41 and any value value of @xmath56",
    ", we find that the ordinary vacuum einstein solutions also solve the coupled einstein - scalar equations .",
    "as we are here restricted to spherically symmetric and static configurations without cosmological constant , the solutions that show up are the schwarzschild and anti - schwarzschild geometries ( @xmath57 represents a perfectly good solution to the einstein field equations , normally the negative mass schwarzschild geometry is excluded by hand , here it s best to keep it for the time being as an aid in classifying the total solution space . )    more surprising is that for @xmath0 and @xmath58 every ricci - scalar - flat geometry is a solution .",

    "the classical solutions for a massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity are very well known .",

    "for @xmath2 we easily find the following solutions : @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 two arbitrary real constants . the second set of solutions is unphysical because it gives a negative sign for the metric signature ( opposite to the one we are using ) .",
    "however , one can easily demonstrate  @xcite that the einstein tensor @xmath5 and the energy - momentum tensor ( [ e : emt ] ) for a massless scalar field are both invariant if we change @xmath84 to @xmath85 leaving the field unchanged .",
    "therefore , from the unphysical solutions ( [ e : unphysicalsol ] ) we obtain physical solutions of the form @xmath86 we can also find additional solutions by considering the limiting cases when the constants @xmath82 or @xmath83 tend to ( @xmath87 ) infinity . in this way we find the solutions : @xmath88 all these metrics @xmath89 , described in ( [ e : physicalsol1 ] ) , ( [ e : physicalsol2 ] ) , ( [ e : physicalsol1l ] ) , and ( [ e : physicalsol2l ] ) have a zero scalar curvature , @xmath59 , owing to the conformal coupling features  @xcite . therefore , any of these geometries , supplemented with the specific value @xmath90 for the non - minimally coupled scalar field ( with @xmath0 ) are examples of the `` trivial '' solutions for the non - minimally coupled system of which we have spoken at the beginning of this section , ) and ( [ e : physicalsol2l ] ) , are already in this later class . ] and these `` trivial '' solutions no longer seem to be all that trivial .",

    "first one crosses the non - singular section with @xmath201 .",
    "later on , one crosses a spherical section with a minimum diameter ( a throat ) , and from that point on the size of the spherical sections begin to grow to reach another asymptotic region associated with some asymptotic value for the scalar field which is of course lower than @xmath177 .",

    "@xmath77 : + we find assorted naked singularities .",
    "in some of them the geometry shrinks to zero , in others the singularity is placed in an asymptotic region , and yet others there is a scalar curvature singularity at a finite size spherical section .",
    "+ for a constant value of the field we recover the schwarzschild solution , but if this value is exactly @xmath233 the geometry can be arbitrarily chosen from among the solutions for the conformal @xmath49 case .",
    "+ apart from these solutions we find a two - parameter family of perfectly well - defined traversable wormholes geometries .",
    "given an asymptotic value for the scalar field , with absolute value lower than @xmath191 , and a scalar charge , the asymptotic mass for a traversable wormhole is fixed .",
    "@xmath2 : + the case of conformal coupling leads to the same type of naked singularities that were seen before , but the scalar curvature singularities are now absent .",
    "+ the different geometries can appear either in combination with a suitable spatial dependent scalar field , or with a constant field @xmath234 . + here , we have also a two - parameter family of traversable wormholes with the only difference that now the asymptotic value of the scalar field can have arbitrary values .",
    "in fact , when one asymptotic region has an infinite value for the scalar field it means that it is not asymptotically flat , degenerating to a cornucopia  @xcite .",
    "@xmath136 : + once more we find assorted naked singularities of the same type as in the conformal coupling .",
    "+ for a special constant value of the field , @xmath233 , the geometry can again be arbitrarily selected from among the solutions for the conformal @xmath49 case . for a different constant value",
    "we only recover the schwarzschild solution .",
    "+ also , there are specific traversable wormhole solutions in which an infinite asymptotic value for the scalar field can not be reached .",
    "since the potential existence of traversable wormholes is a perhaps somewhat disturbing possibility , we feel it a good idea to see where the potential pitfalls might be  mathematically , we have exhibited exact classical traversable wormhole solutions to the einstein equations , and now wish to investigate the extent to which they should physically be trusted .    to start with",
    ", scalar fields play a somewhat ambiguous role in modern theoretical physics : on the one hand they provide great toy models , and are from a theoretician s perspective almost inevitable components of any reasonable model of empirical reality ; on the other hand the direct experimental / observational evidence is spotty .    the only scalar fields for which we have really direct `` hands - on '' experimental evidence are the scalar mesons ( pions @xmath235 ; kaons @xmath236 ; and their `` charm '' , `` truth '' , and `` beauty '' relatives , plus a whole slew of resonances such as the @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 ,  )  @xcite .",
    "not a single one of these particles are fundamental , they are all quark - antiquark bound states , and while the description in terms of scalar fields is useful when these systems are probed at low momenta ( as measured in their rest frame ) we should certainly not continue to use the scalar field description once the system is probed with momenta greater than @xmath241 . in terms of the scalar field itself , this means you should not trust the scalar field description if gradients become large , if @xmath242 similarly you should not trust the scalar field description if the energy density in the scalar field exceeds the critical density for the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "( note that if the scalar mesons were strict goldstone bosons [ exactly massless ] rather than pseudo ",
    "goldstone bosons , then they could achieve arbitrarily large values of the field variable with zero energy cost . )",
    "thus scalar mesons are a mixed bag : they definitely exist , and we know quite a bit about their properties , but there are stringent limitations on how far we should trust the scalar field description .",
    "the next candidate scalar field that is closest to experimental verification is the higgs particle responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "while in the standard model the higgs is fundamental , and while almost everyone is firmly convinced that some higgs - like scalar field exits , there is a possibility that the physical higgs ( like the scalar mesons ) might itself be a bound state of some deeper level of elementary particles ( , technicolor and its variants ) . despite the tremendous successes of the standard model of particle physics we do not ( currently ) have direct proof of the existence of a fundamental higgs scalar field",
    "accepting for now the existence of a fundamental higgs scalar , what is its curvature coupling ?",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is completely unconstrained in the flat - space standard model .",
    "if we choose for technical reasons to adopt the `` new improved stress energy tensor '' for the higgs scalar in flat spacetime then one is naturally led to conformal coupling in curved spacetime  @xcite .",
    "conformal coupling seems to be the `` most natural '' choice for the higgs curvature coupling , and we have seen in this note that both conformal coupling and the entire open half - line @xmath243 surrounding conformal coupling lead to traversable wormhole geometries . unfortunately adding a higgs mass results in analytically intractable equations .",
    "a third candidate scalar field of great phenomenological interest is the axion : it is extremely difficult to see how one could make strong interaction physics compatible with the observed lack of strong cp violation , without something like an axion to solve the so - called `` strong cp problem '' .",
    "still , the axion has not yet been directly observed experimentally",
    ".    a fourth candidate scalar field of phenomenological interest specifically within the astrophysics / cosmology community is the so - called `` inflaton '' .",
    "this scalar field is used as a mechanism for driving the anomalously fast expansion of the universe during the inflationary era .",
    "while observationally it is a relatively secure bet that something like cosmological inflation ( in the sense of anomalously fast cosmological expansion ) actually took place , and while scalar fields of some type are presently viewed as the most reasonable way of driving inflation , we must again admit that direct observational verification of the existence of the inflaton field ( and its variants , such as quintessence ) is far from being accomplished .",
    "note that in many forms of inflation trans ",
    "planckian values of the scalar field are generic and widely accepted ( though not universally accepted ) as part of the inflationary paradigm .",
    "a fifth candidate scalar field of phenomenological interest specifically within the general relativity community is the so - called `` brans ",
    "dicke scalar '' .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest extension to einstein gravity that is not ruled out by experiment .",
    "( it is certainly greatly constrained by observation and experiment , and there is no positive experimental data guaranteeing its existence , but it is not ruled out . ) the relativity community views the brans  dicke scalar mainly as an excellent testing ground for alternative ideas and as a useful way of parameterizing possible deviations from einstein gravity .",
    "( and experimentally and observationally , einstein gravity still wins . )    in this regard it is important to emphasize that the type of scalar fields we have been discussing in the present paper are completely compatible with current experimental limits on brans ",
    "dicke scalars , or more generally , generic scalar - tensor theories  @xcite .",
    "to take the observational limits and utilize them in our formalism you need to use the translations @xmath244 @xmath245 then , the physical newton constant , which takes its meaning within the perturbative ppn expansion around flat minkowski space , can be written as @xmath246 ( here , we have set the function @xmath247 in ( [ effective ] ) equal to one .",
    "however it must be pointed out that if @xmath248 then the current theories are more general even than the standard scalar - tensor models ) . in the wormhole solutions that we have found , the scalar field @xmath249 reaches a trans - planckian value in one of the asymptotic regions , making the physical newton constant negative .",
    "this means that , contrary to what is commonly done in scalar - tensor theories  @xcite , the translated brans - dicke field should not be restricted to only positive values . in order to cover our wormhole solutions , negative values of the brans - dicke field",
    "are required .",
    "current solar system measurements imply @xmath250  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , vlbi techniques allow us to use the deflection of light by the sun to place very strong constraints on the ppn parameter @xmath251 , with  @xcite @xmath252 the standard result that for brans  dicke theories  @xcite @xmath253 now provides the limit on @xmath254 quoted above .",
    "for instance , this constraint is very easily satisfied if the scalar field @xmath249 is a small fraction of the naive planck scale ( @xmath255 ) in the solar neighborhood .",
    "thus , the scalar theories we investigate in this paper are perfectly compatible with known physics .",
    "finally , the membrane - inspired field theories ( low - energy limits of what used to be called string theory ) are literally infested with scalar fields . in membrane theories it is impossible to avoid scalar fields , with the most ubiquitous being the so - called `` dilaton '' .",
    "however , the dilaton field is far from unique , in general there is a large class of so - called `` moduli '' fields , which are scalar fields corresponding to the directions in which the background spacetime geometry is particularly `` soft '' and easily deformed .",
    "so if membrane theory really is the fundamental theory of quantum gravity , then the existence of fundamental scalar fields is automatic , with the field theory description of these fundamental scalars being valid at least up to the planck scale , and possibly higher .",
    "( for good measure , by making a conformal transformation of the spacetime geometry it is typically possible to put membrane - inspired scalar fields into a framework which closely parallels that of the generalized brans  dicke fields .",
    "thus there is a potential for much cross - pollination between brans ",
    "dicke inspired variants of general relativity and membrane - inspired field theories . )",
    "so overall , we have excellent theoretical reasons to expect that scalar field theories are an integral part of reality , but the direct experimental / observational verification of the existence of fundamental fields is still an open question .",
    "nevertheless , we think it fair to say that there are excellent reasons for taking scalar fields seriously , and excellent reasons for thinking that the gravitational properties of scalar fields are of interest cosmologically , astrophysically , and for providing fundamental probes of general relativity .",
    "the fact that scalar fields then lead to such widespread violations of the energy conditions  @xcite , with potentially far - reaching consequences like a `` universal bounce '' ( instead of a big - bang singularity )  @xcite , the traversable wormholes of this paper ( see also  @xcite ) , and possibly even weirder physics ( see for example  @xcite ) , leads to a rather sobering assessment of the marked limitations of our current understanding .",
