    "luminosity profiles have long been used to study the structure and evolution of old globular clusters ( e.g. , king 1966 ; illingworth & illingworth 1976 ) .",
    "their application to the study of young massive clusters is of more recent origin , having begun in earnest with the classic study of ten rich , 8300  myr old clusters in the lmc by elson , fall , & freeman ( 1987 , hereafter eff87 ) . as this study demonstrated , the luminosity profiles of ymcs differ significantly and systematically from those of old globulars .",
    "the observed differences contain important clues concerning the formation and dynamical evolution of massive star clusters .    among the various motivations for studying luminosity profiles ( hereafter lps ) of ymcs",
    "is our desire to understand the effects of mass segregation as a function of time and to separate any possible primordial mass segregation from the longer - term segregation caused by energy equipartition .",
    "young massive clusters offer two main advantages : they still contain stars over most of the mass range of @xmath30.1120 @xmath11 , and they allow us to trace evolutionary effects directly as a function of cluster age .",
    "luminosity profiles can also yield information on core collapse , both slow and fast ( `` equipartition instability , '' spitzer 1969 ) , and on the possible formation of central black holes in clusters .",
    "finally , such profiles can help us evaluate the impact of mass loss on cluster formation and disruption , yielding estimates of the fraction of field stars that may have originated in clusters .",
    "we are all familiar with king ( 1966 ) model profiles , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , which fit the lps of old globular clusters better than gaussian or modified hubble profiles do .",
    "king profiles are derived from model clusters with equal - mass stars and truncated maxwellian velocity distributions ( `` lowered isothermal models '' ) , and are characterized by three parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 ( central surface brightness , core radius , and tidal radius ) . the concentration index , @xmath14 , is a measure of how strongly tidal truncation has affected the cluster .    as eff87 first showed and elson ( 1991 ) further demonstrated , young massive clusters in the lmc feature power - law envelopes and are well fit by model profiles of the form @xmath15 , much better so than by king profiles . at radii @xmath16 , these eff profiles take the simple power - law form @xmath17 . like the king profiles ,",
    "they are characterized by three parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( central surface brightness , characteristic radius , and power - law slope ) .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath18 is related to the core (= half - central - surface - brightness ) radius @xmath8 through @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ fig1]b illustrates that the 130  myr - old lmc cluster ngc 1866 is , indeed , better fit by an eff model profile than by king profiles ( eff87 ; lupton et al .",
    "1989 ) .    in trying to understand cluster dynamics , three characteristic time scales are important ( e.g. , spitzer 1987 ; meylan 2003 ) : ( 1 ) the crossing time @xmath21 during which a star typically crosses the system ; ( 2 ) the half - mass relaxation time @xmath22 during which stellar encounters redistribute energies to the point of setting up a near - maxwellian velocity distribution within the half - mass radius ; and ( 3 ) the evolution time @xmath23 , which is the time it takes for slow dynamical processes like the evaporation of stars from the cluster to significantly change the cluster size and profile .",
    "it has long been known that for globular clusters  @xmath24 , with typical values of @xmath25 yr , @xmath26 yr , and @xmath27 yr . thus , the lps of young massive clusters should yield valuable information about equipartition and relaxation processes in the inner parts of these clusters .    how far can we hope to study lps of clusters in sufficient detail to learn about the structural details that interest us ?",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the _ apparent _ sizes of the core , half - light , and tidal radius of a typical milky - way globular cluster as a function of its hypothetical distance in mpc .",
    "this typical globular , with radii taken as the median values of 143 globulars listed by djorgovski ( 1993 ) , has @xmath28 pc , @xmath29 pc , and @xmath30 pc , and a concentration index of @xmath31 . as the three sloping lines of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicate , this cluster  if placed at the distance of the lmc  would show a fully resolved core even from the ground ( assumed seeing of @xmath32 fwhm ) . at the distance of m31",
    "the same cluster would still appear well resolved with _ hst _ , while at the 3.5 mpc distance of m82 its core would be only marginally resolved . beyond the latter distance this typical cluster becomes unresolved at its center even when observed with",
    "_ hst_. at the 20  mpc distance of the antennae galaxies , even the _ half - light _",
    "radius of such a cluster can no longer be resolved with _",
    "hst _ and has to be estimated by placing an upper limit on it .",
    "because of these resolution limits , we first review the fully resolved lps of young massive clusters within the local group and then the only partially resolved lps of clusters beyond .",
    "much new information on lps of ymcs in the local group has been published during the past five years , most of it for clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "together the lmc and smc host an estimated @xmath36,000 clusters , most of which are @xmath103  gyr old , offering us a rich sample of ymcs in the 10@xmath210@xmath9 yr age range .",
    "mackey & gilmore ( 2003a , b ; hereafter mg03a , b ) have just published the first systematic _ hst_/wfpc2 study of lps of 53 rich clusters in the lmc and 10 in the smc , yielding profiles of sub - arcsecond resolution well into the cores ( @xmath33 pc at lmc distance ) .",
    "some of their main results are as follows .    in general ,",
    "virtually all observed profiles of clusters younger than 1  gyr are well fit by eff profiles , thus confirming the findings by eff87 .",
    "the slopes of the power - law envelopes lie in the range @xmath343.8 , with a median @xmath35 .",
    "many profiles show bumps , steps , and/or wiggles , indicating the presence of significant substructure . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the 32  myr old cluster ngc 1850 and its profile .",
    "notice the inner dip at @xmath36 and the outer bump near @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , which is created mainly by the distinct subclump of stars to the west , sometimes called ngc 1850b .",
    "( the slope of the best - fit eff profile shown in the figure is likely too shallow because of the limited extent of the wfpc2 data , and the fitted profile should probably go through the last group of data points . )",
    "subclumps are seen in the envelopes of most very young clusters and can still be traced in some clusters several 100  myr old , suggesting that cluster formation itself may be hierarchical ( kroupa 1998 ) . presumably , this clumpiness accelerates the initial relaxation of newborn clusters .",
    "interestingly , none of the observed 41 lmc clusters younger than 3  gyr shows evidence of having undergone core collapse , as would be indicated by a profile with power - law shape at the very center ( mg03a ) .",
    "however , such post - core - collapse ( pcc ) structure is found in @xmath39 of the 12 observed old ( @xmath4010  gyr ) lmc globulars .",
    "these and a few other known pcc clusters have central power - law profiles of slope @xmath410.7 and represent about @xmath42 of the old cluster population in the lmc , a similar pcc fraction as is observed among the globulars of the milky way .",
    "these observations support the theoretical result that  at least for single - stellar - mass systems  core collapse takes 1219  @xmath22 to occur , or about 300 central relaxation times ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .    correlations between the core radius and various other cluster parameters have been searched for , yet few have been found .",
    "specifically , the core radius does not seem to correlate with cluster mass . the one significant correlation found is between the core radius and cluster age , as first shown by elson , freeman , & lauer ( 1989 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the core radii of the 53 lmc and 10 smc clusters observed by mackey and gilmore ( mg03a , b ) plotted versus cluster age @xmath43 .",
    "the new _ hst _ data confirm elson et al s ( 1989 ) finding that the core radii of the youngest clusters are @xmath101  pc and show little scatter , while those of clusters older than 20  myr tend to increase with age at least until @xmath44  gyr and show large scatter at @xmath45  gyr ( @xmath46 pc ) .",
    "however , the relation now appears to have _ two branches _ : a lower branch containing about 3/4 of the total cluster population and reaching a maximum _ mean _ core radius of @xmath32.5  pc at @xmath442  gyr before trending toward smaller @xmath8 again , and an upper branch containing about 1/4 of the clusters and showing core radii that increase in proportion to the logarithmic age .",
    "as mg03a , b demonstrate , for clusters older than 10  gyr as well as for all those older than 1  gyr the bimodality in the core - radius distribution is highly significant ( @xmath4799% , @xmath4799.5% ) , whence the bifurcation of the @xmath8@xmath48 relation into two branches appears real .",
    "the time evolution of core radii traced by the _ lower branch _ is about as expected : the initial rapid core expansion is likely due to mass loss from massive stars ( @xmath49  gyr ) , and is followed by slow core contraction due to continued energy equipartition and evaporation of stars , eventually leading to gravothermal instability and core collapse ( elson et al .  1989 ; see also binney & tremaine 1987 ) .    the time evolution of core radii traced by the _ upper branch _",
    ", however , remains unexplained .",
    "clusters of similar age and metallicity on the upper and lower branches appear to have had very similar initial mass functions ( imf ) down to @xmath30.8 @xmath50 , whence imf variations can be ruled out as an explanation for the existence of two branches ( de grijs et al .",
    "@xmath51-body simulations seem to also rule out as viable explanations any possible tidal - field variations due to different cluster orbits and hypothetical large variations in the primordial binary fraction ( wilkinson et al .",
    "perhaps most promising is the very recent suggestion that core formation and expansion may be driven dynamically by the central accumulation of massive stars and their black - hole remnants ( merritt et al .",
    "the observed strong segregation of massive stars toward the cluster centers ( e.g. , de grijs et al .",
    "2002a ) and simple model simulations that reproduce the approximately linear increase of @xmath8 with logarithmic age both seem to support this hypothesis .",
    "yet , the hypothesis does not explain why the scatter in core radii increases dramatically with age and why there should be two branches .",
    "r136 is the high - surface - brightness core of the 34  myr old cluster ngc 2070 located at the center of the 30 doradus nebula , the most luminous hii region in the local group .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the cluster and its luminosity profile .",
    "this profile is the only one among the 63 cluster profiles measured by mg03a , b that clearly shows a two - component structure .",
    "it is well fitted by a central eff model profile with @xmath52 pc ( @xmath53 ) within the core ( @xmath54 ) , and by a second eff ( or king ) profile with @xmath558 pc ( 1533 ) beyond the core ( meylan 1993 ; mg03a ) .    because r136/ngc 2070 is by far the youngest massive magellanic cloud cluster and possibly a globular cluster in formation ( e.g. , kennicutt & chu 1988 )",
    ", its study is of great interest and promises insights into the earliest dynamical evolution of ymcs .",
    "the evidence for mass segregation in it is strong : while the core radius is @xmath56 pc for light from all stars , it drops to @xmath57 pc for massive stars of @xmath4720 @xmath50 and @xmath30.03 pc for those of @xmath4740 @xmath50 ( brandl et al .",
    "it is this strong central concentration of the most massive and luminous stars that led , during the 1980s , to the mistaken belief that a supermassive star ( `` r136a '' ) of @xmath32500 @xmath50 might sit at the center of the cluster .    as we now know",
    ", there is a strong concentration of o3 , o4 , and wn stars at and near the center , some with masses thought to be as high as 130150 @xmath50 ( massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "spectroscopy and ir observations of these and other , pre - main - sequence stars suggest that lower - mass stars began forming in ngc 2070 about 45  myr ago , while the most massive stars formed a mere 12  myr ago and quenched further star formation via their strong winds . yet , despite this sequential formation the _ overall _ imf of ngc 2070 appears to be essentially normal and salpeter - like .",
    "specifically , searches for low - mass stars show evidence of rising numbers right into the core down to @xmath32.8 @xmath50 ( hunter et al .",
    "1995 ) and even 0.6 @xmath50 ( sirianni et al .",
    "although because of the mass segregation the imf does seem to flatten below @xmath32 @xmath50 within r136 itself , overall it appears very similar to the kroupa ( 2001 ) or chabrier ( 2003 ) imfs now generally thought to be characteristic of star formation in the milky - way disk and in loose young clusters .",
    "hence , the observations of this newborn cluster clearly contradict some theoretical predictions that the imf of stars formed in high - density regions should be very top heavy .",
    "they also raise doubts about the importance of occasionally - claimed primordial mass segregation .",
    "an interesting question is whether the unusual core - within - a - core structure of r136/ngc 2070 may have led to early core collapse .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 ) showed that under certain circumstances clusters with a wide range of stellar masses may experience an _ equipartition instability _",
    ", in which the most massive stars form a dense subsystem at the core of the lighter stars .",
    "while exchanging energy with the lighter stars , this subsystem can evolve away , rather than toward , equipartition , contracting rapidly and leading to accelerated core collapse . whether this did or did not happen in r136",
    "depends critically on the core radius measured as a function of mass and on the estimated central relaxation time .",
    "mg03a find marginal evidence for a central power - law cusp of slope @xmath581.17 , but conclude  like brandl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) before  that the evidence favors strong and rapid dynamical mass segregation over any post - core - collapse state .    in short , the two - component profile of this @xmath334",
    "myr old cluster suggests that ( i ) strong dynamical evolution and mass segregation occur very early on and ( ii ) core growth during the first @xmath310  myr may be complex .",
    "surprisingly little information exists on the luminosity profiles of ymcs in local group galaxies other than the magellanic clouds . for the milky way , m31 , and m33",
    "the situation is as follows .",
    "the milky way seems to harbor few ymcs comparable to those in the lmc and smc .",
    "attempts to measure their lps suffer from severe disk - star contamination and extinction .",
    "perhaps the best studied is the 12  myr old cluster ngc 3603 , whose @xmath59  mag is relatively benign .",
    "it is one of the most massive young clusters known in the milky way , yet it has only about 1/40th the mass of r136/ngc 2070 . like",
    "the latter , it features low - mass stars of 0.11 @xmath50 right into its center and has a normal imf ( e.g. , brandl et al .",
    "infrared observations yield a lp with a core radius of @xmath60 pc ( 23 ) and extending out to at least 5 pc , where it becomes lost in the light of foreground stars ( nrnberger & petr - gotzens 2002 ) .",
    "the situation is even more challenging for the milky way s central ymcs , with the arches cluster showing extinction _ variations _ of @xmath61 mag over 15  ( stolte et al .  2002 ) and , thus , offering little hope for any luminosity profiles in the near future .",
    "although some ymcs resembling young globulars have long been known to exist in m31 ( e.g. , van den bergh 1969 ) , none have had their lps measured . yet , at least for the four 60160  myr old ymcs observed by williams & hodge ( 2001 ) with _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 , lps would be easy to derive from the archival images .",
    "luminosity profiles have , however , been measured for _ old _ massive clusters and show evidence for pcc structure and extended envelopes ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) and , in the still controversial case of cluster g1 , for a central black hole of mass @xmath62 ( gebhardt , rich , & ho 2002 ) .",
    "m33  hosts a rich system of @xmath63@xmath64  yr old clusters similar to those in the magellanic clouds . for @xmath360 of these clusters",
    ", lps have been derived from _ hst_/wfpc2 images and fitted with king profiles ( chandar , bianchi , & ford 1999 ) .",
    "the measured core radii are @xmath652 pc , and there is evidence for extended envelopes . at least for clusters younger than @xmath33",
    "gyr , the analysis needs to be repeated with the more appropriate eff profiles .",
    "even with _ hst _ , the cores of ymcs become marginally resolved around 24  mpc and unresolved beyond ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "special software has been developed to analyze observations of partially resolved clusters by fitting king or eff model light distributions ( larsen 1999 ; carlson & holtzman 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we can still extract some size and shape parameters from ymcs out to at least 20 mpc .",
    "among relatively nearby ( 26 mpc ) galaxies , luminosity profiles have been measured for ymcs in ngc 1569 ( hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) , m82 ( de grijs et al .  2001 ) , and ngc 6946 ( larsen et al .",
    "in general , the core radii of these ymcs are similar to those measured in lmc clusters .",
    "also , all ymcs younger than @xmath310@xmath4yr show power - law envelopes , and many show clumpy substructure .",
    "an especially interesting case are the 43 globular clusters profiled in ngc 5128 ( 4 mpc , harris et al .",
    "2002 ) , where six of the most luminous clusters ( @xmath66 ) show envelopes extending beyond the best - fit king models .",
    "although harris et al .",
    "interpret these envelopes as being either due to evaporative mass loss or the remains of stripped former dwarf galaxies , a third possibility needs to be considered : the presence of intermediate - age globular clusters in ngc 5128 ( peng , ford , & freeman 2004 ) and the high luminosity of the six globulars may indicate that these are relatively young clusters with incompletely stripped remains of their initial power - law envelopes .    even for galaxies more distant than 10 mpc , there is still much to learn from luminosity profiles of ymcs . especially intriguing",
    "are the hints of dynamical evolution seen among clusters of different ages in the antennae ( whitmore et al .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the lps of three massive clusters there : knot  s and # 430 are both very young ( 7 and 11  myr ) , have unresolved cores , and display pure power - law envelopes like young lmc clusters .",
    "in contrast , the 500  myr - old cluster # 225 shows both a larger , partially resolved core ( @xmath67 pc ) and an envelope with a distinct tidal cutoff .",
    "this suggests that , like elsewhere , young clusters in the antennae form with power - law envelopes , but then get truncated over the next several 100  myr by external tidal forces .    finally , even at the 66 mpc distance of the merger remnant ngc 7252 evidence for extended envelopes of ymcs can be found . among the @xmath3300 young halo globulars of solar metallicity and ages 300600 myr ( miller et al .",
    "1997 ; schweizer & seitzer 1998 ) , the five most luminous clusters feature extended envelopes reaching well past 100  pc radius .",
    "the most luminous , ngc7252:w3 ( @xmath68 ) , is a true supercluster with @xmath69  pc and a record - beating mass of @xmath70 , corresponding to 1520@xmath71 the mass of @xmath72cen ( maraston et al .",
    "apparently , while orbiting in the halo of ngc 7252 this heavy - weight young globular of age 300500  myr may have managed to hang on  so far  to most of its original power - law envelope ."
