    "much progress has been made in the past several years to improve our theoretical understanding of the physics of a heavy hadron containing a single heavy quark ( charm or bottom quark ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the discover of the powerful heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry @xcite in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the development of the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "heavy hadrons containing both the heavy bottom and charm quarks are also of interest . of particular importance",
    "is the @xmath1 meson family .",
    "since the top quark is very heavy and will decay rapidly into @xmath10 before hadronization , the @xmath1 system might be the only physical system containing two heavy flavors of different masses .",
    "techniques of heavy quark effective theory can not be applied here because the charm quark is not sufficient light . however , since this family is intermediate between the @xmath11 charmonium and the @xmath12 bottomonium systems , many properties ( mass spectrum , transition and decay rates , lifetimes , _",
    "etc_. ) of this physical system can be studied by using potential models and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that the dominant production mechanism for these yet unobserved @xmath1 bound states with large transverse momentum at a high energy process is fragmentation , in which an energetic @xmath13 antiquark is first produced at large transverse momentum by a short - distance hard process and subsequently fragments into various @xmath1 bound states .",
    "furthermore , the process independent fragmentation functions describing these phenomena are shown to be calculable at the heavy quark mass scale using perturbative qcd .",
    "in particular , the fragmentation functions for the @xmath13 antiquark to split into the two @xmath2-wave states @xmath14 and @xmath15 were calculated @xcite to leading order in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the typical relative velocity of the charm quark inside the meson . including the @xmath6 and @xmath18 states that lie below the @xmath5 flavor threshold @xmath19 , a",
    "lower bound on the inclusive branching fraction for the production of the @xmath7 ground state from @xmath20 decay has been estimated to be about @xmath9 @xcite , which might be too small for this particle to be observed at lep with the present luminosity .",
    "production of the @xmath7 meson at the hadron colliders via the direct @xmath13 antiquark and induced gluon fragmentation has also been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "about 20,000 @xmath7 with transverse momentum @xmath21 gev are expected to be produced at the tevatron with an integrated luminosity of @xmath22 .",
    "a clean signature of @xmath7 would be the observation of three charged leptons coming from the same secondary vertex due to the decay @xmath23 followed by @xmath24 .",
    "the combined branching fraction for these decays is expected to be about @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "one expects about 40 of these distinctive events at the tevatron . thus , unless lep can increase its luminosity by an order of magnitude or so in the near future , the best place to look for the charmed beauty meson will be at the tevatron .",
    "the mass spectrum of the @xmath1 mesons has been obtained by eichten and quigg @xcite using potential model calculations . since , unlike the quarkonium system , the @xmath13 and @xmath26 quarks",
    "do not annihilate into gluons , the excited states of the @xmath1 mesons can not decay directly into light hadrons .",
    "states that lie above the @xmath5 threshold will strongly decay into a pair of @xmath27 and @xmath28 mesons .",
    "states that lie below the @xmath5 threshold will decay eventually to the ground state @xmath7 either by hadronic cascades or by emitting photons . in order to get more reliable theoretical prediction for the inclusive production rate of the @xmath7 meson at large transverse momentum",
    ", one must include all higher orbitally excited states of the @xmath1 mesons that lie below the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "below the @xmath5 flavor threshold , there are two sets of @xmath2-wave states ( the @xmath6 and @xmath18 states ) , as many as two complete sets of @xmath0-wave states ( the @xmath3 and perhaps some or all @xmath4 states ) , and one set of @xmath28-wave states ( the @xmath29 states ) . in this paper , we report the results of the calculation of the fragmentation functions for @xmath13 antiquark splittings into the four @xmath0-wave @xmath1 mesons  the @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 states . in section 2",
    ", we write down new factorization formulas for the @xmath0-wave fragmentation functions that are valid to all orders in strong coupling constant @xmath16 and to leading order in @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the typical relative velocity of the heavy quarks inside the @xmath1 meson .",
    "long - distance effects are factored into two nonperturbative parameters : the derivative of the radial wavefunction at the origin , and a second parameter related to the probability for the @xmath1 pair that is produced in a color - octet @xmath2-wave state to form a color - singlet @xmath0-wave bound state . in section 3 , we calculate the perturbative coefficients of the fragmentation functions to leading order in @xmath16 . infrared logarithmically - divergent terms that appeared at the next - to - leading order in @xmath16",
    "are isolated and absorbed into the second nonperturbative parameter . mixing effects between the @xmath30 and @xmath33 states in the fragmentation functions",
    "are also calculated . in section 4 , we take the heavy quark limit of @xmath34 , and show that our fragmentation functions exhibit the heavy quark spin symmetry while earlier results obtained by chen @xcite do not satisfy this important property . in section 5 , we discuss a crossing relation between the fragmentation function @xmath35 for parton @xmath36 splittings into hadron @xmath37 and the distribution function @xmath38 of finding parton @xmath36 inside hadron @xmath37 . in section 6 , we consider the equal mass limit corresponding to the case of @xmath0-wave heavy quarkonium .",
    "numerical results and conclusions are made in section 7 .",
    "recently bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite have reformulated the perturbative calculations of the annihilation rates of heavy quarkonium using the framework of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "this work points out that the usual factorization assumption that all long - distance effects can be absorbed into the radial wavefunctions at the origin and their derivatives is not correct when higher order qcd corrections and/or relativistic corrections are taken into account .",
    "infrared divergences that arise in these higher order calculations spoil factorization . to obtain sensible perturbative results that are free from infrared divergences",
    ", one must use new factorization formulas that involve a double expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath16 and in the typical velocity @xmath17 of the heavy quark inside the quarkonium @xcite . the easiest way to organize the expansion in @xmath17 in these theoretical calculations",
    "is to use nrqcd @xcite .    as in the quarkonium case @xcite , the heavy quarks inside the @xmath1 meson are moving nonrelativistically and separated at a typical distance of order @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the typical relative velocity of the heavy quarks and @xmath41 is the reduced mass .",
    "the calculation of the perturbative fragmentation function is based on separating short - distance perturbative effects involving the scale of order @xmath42 from long - distance nonperturbative effects involving scales of order @xmath39 or larger . to leading order in @xmath17 ,",
    "two distinct mechanisms that contribute to the fragmentation function have been identified and are referred as the _ color - singlet mechanism _ and _ color - octet mechanism_. the _ color - singlet mechanism _ is the production of a @xmath1 pair in a color - singlet @xmath30 or @xmath31 state with separation of order @xmath42 in the @xmath1 meson rest frame .",
    "the subsequent formation of the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 bound state is a long - distance nonperturbative process with a probability of order @xmath43 , where the first factor @xmath44 arises from the derivative of the wavefunction of the @xmath0-wave state and the second factor @xmath45 is a volume factor @xcite .",
    "the _ color - octet mechanism _ is the production of the @xmath1 pair in a color - octet @xmath46 or @xmath47 state with a separation of order @xmath42 .",
    "the subsequent formation of the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 bound state can proceed either through the dominant @xmath48 component or through the small @xmath49 component of the wavefunction . in the first case ,",
    "the @xmath1 pair must radiate a soft gluon to make a transition to the color - singlet @xmath0-wave bound state . in the second case",
    ", a soft gluon must combine with the @xmath1 pair to form the color - singlet @xmath0-wave bound state . in both cases ,",
    "the probability is of order @xmath50 , with a factor of @xmath51 coming from the volume factor and an addition factor of @xmath44 coming either from the probability of radiating a soft gluon or from the small probability of the @xmath49 component of the wavefunction @xcite . since the _ color - singlet mechanism _ and _ color - octet mechanism _",
    "contribute to the fragmentation function at the same order in @xmath17 , they must both be included for a consistent calculation .",
    "separation of the short - distance physics from the long - distance effects discussed in the previous paragraph requires the introduction of an arbitrary factorization scale @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the fragmentation functions for the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 mesons satisfy factorization formulas that involve this arbitrary scale . to leading order in @xmath44 and to all order in @xmath16 , the factorization formulas for the fragmentation functions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 at a scale @xmath56 near the heavy quark mass scale consist of two terms : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are nonperturbative long - distance factors associated with the _ color - singlet _ and _ color - octet mechanism _ respectively , @xmath60 is the reduced mass , and @xmath61 , labels the principal quantum number of the @xmath0-wave states",
    ". the short - distance factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be calculated perturbatively as power series in @xmath16 .",
    "they are proportional to the fragmentation functions for a @xmath13 antiquark to split into a @xmath1 pair with vanishing relative momentum and definite color - spin - orbital quantum numbers : color - singlet @xmath30 or @xmath31 state for @xmath64 and color - octet @xmath46 or @xmath47 state for @xmath65 .",
    "note that in these factorization formulas , the only dependence on @xmath52 is in @xmath64 and @xmath66 . as in the quarkonium case ,",
    "the nonperturbative parameters @xmath58 and @xmath67 can be rigorously defined as matrix elements of 4-quark operators in nonrelativistic qcd divided by appropriate powers of the heavy quark masses @xcite .",
    "their dependence on @xmath52 is governed by a renormalization group equation whose coefficient can be calculated using nonrelativistic qcd @xcite .",

    "( [ d3pjtotal ] ) , one can choose @xmath52 on the order of @xmath60 . since @xmath77 is of order @xmath50 @xcite , from eqns.([hone ] ) and ( [ rgsol ] )",

    "we now embark on the calculation of the coefficient @xmath62 in the color - singlet contribution to the fragmentation function .",
    "let us first briefly review the method that was introduced in refs.@xcite of calculating the heavy quark fragmentation functions using perturbative qcd .",
