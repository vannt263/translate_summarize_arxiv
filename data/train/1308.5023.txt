    "radially pulsating stars like cepheids , rr lyrae or miras stars are important distance indicators in the local universe .",
    "the presence of such a variable star in an eclipsing binary system serves as a unique opportunity to derive fundamental astrophysical parameters of the pulsating component with few model assumptions . furthermore eclipsing binaries provide a very good means to independently calibrate distance determination methods based on pulsating stars by comparison with the distance obtained from the binary star analysis . until now",
    "only a few classical cepheids were identified in eclipsing binaries ( pietrzyski et al . 2010 , 2011 ) and one system with a pseudo rr lyrae component",
    "was reported ( pietrzyski et al . 2012 ) , there are also candidates for such systems that await confirmation .",
    "the typical eclipsing binary star model consists of fixed size stars . to account for pulsations one usually :",
    "1 ) modifies an existing modeling tool , 2 ) develops a new computer code , 3 ) removes pulsations from light and radial velocity curves and solves them with ordinary eclipsing binary star model .",
    "the first approach was used by wilson & van hamme ( 2010 ) in case of the well - known wilson - devinney code ( wilson & devinney 1971 ; hereafter wd code ) , but only some phenomenological model was reported .",
    "the second approach was employed by macho to eclipsing binary cepheids ( alcock et al .",
    "2002 , lepischak et al .",
    "2004 ) , however the code was restricted only to light curve analysis and a rather simplistic treatment of stellar surfaces was used ( e.g. no proximity and reflection effects were accounted for ) .",
    "the third method seems to be the most common and is used in case of non - radial pulsators like @xmath7-scuti stars ( e.g. southworth et al .",
    "2011 ) or @xmath8-doradus stars ( e.g. maceroni et al .",
    "the drawback of such an approach is that during eclipses pulsations can be removed only approximately from the light curves , which produces some systematic residuals in the solution .",
    "the way to partly overcome this difficulty is to employ the iterative light curve solution with the amplitude of the pulsations scaled according to the relative light contribution of a pulsating star during eclipses .",
    "this method was applied by pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) . to deal fully with changes in the eclipse geometry caused by pulsations ,",
    "a novel approach is needed where both spectroscopic and photometric data are treated consistently .",
    "we present here a new method of modeling eclipsing binaries with radially pulsating components . instead of a new code development we decided to use a well - known and thoroughly tested computer model called jktebop ( popper & etzel 1981 , southworth 2004 , 2007 ) as a core of our method .",
    "a python based wrapper that we prepared can generate binary light curves with pulsations taken into account using original jktebop code without any modifications .",
    "a similar methodology was proposed by riazi & abedi ( 2006 ) in case of the wd code , but only for illustrative purposes .",
    "the method was applied to the case of the eclipsing binary cepheid ogle - lmc - cep-0227 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2010 , soszyski et al .",
    "2008 ) in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "one of the main reasons to develop our approach was to directly determine the projection factor ( @xmath9-factor ) for the cepheid from an eclipsing binary analysis .",
    "the @xmath9-factor is defined as the conversion factor between the observed pulsation radial velocities and the velocity of the pulsating star s photosphere .",
    "it plays a crucial role in baade - wesselink ( baade 1926 , wesselink 1946 ) type methods employed to pulsating stars like cepheids .",
    "its exact value and functional dependence on e.g. pulsation period is currently actively debated  see section  [ sub : factor ] in this paper for references . in our opinion , the presented method allows for a robust determination of the @xmath9-factor for pulsating components of detached eclipsing binary systems .",
    "three groups were involved in the process of the preparation of this manuscript , namely the araucaria project ( data , software , analysis ) , the carnegie hubble project ( chp ; data ) and the ogle project ( data ) .",
    "the research was based on observations obtained for eso programme 086.d-0103(a ) , 085.d-0398(a ) , 084.d-0640(a , b ) and cntac time allocation 2010b-059 .",
    "before starting the analysis we had to make sure that we have good enough data to obtain reliable results . when the discovery of the object was announced in 2008 by soszyski et al .",
    "the eclipses were rather scarcely covered by the photometry and this analysis would not be possible . since then as a result of a special observing program a strong emphasis was put on the measurement of the brightness change during eclipses .",
    ".ogle v - band photometry sample ( the full version is available on - line ) .",
    "the errors are scaled to match the condition that the reduced @xmath10 is equal to 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : abs ] presents the physical parameters of both components and some orbital parameters as well .",
    "the spectral type is estimated from the effective temperature scale given in table  1 of alonso et al .",
    "the luminosity class is taken from ginestet et al .",
    "the surface temperatures of the components were calculated according to the dereddened ( @xmath11 ) colors ( gieren et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the effective temperature of the primary was independently derived by marconi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) as @xmath12 k and it is in good agreement with our estimate .",
    "the total error of the absolute radii determination contains statistical uncertainties from the relative radii and the semi - major axis determination .",
    "additionally we add some systematic uncertainty to the budget error which comes from the presence of the small systematic residua still existing in our photometric solution . during",
    "eclipses the magnitude of these residua reaches 0.01 mag which translates into @xmath13 uncertainty of the flux and @xmath14 uncertainty of the radii .",
    "one must note however that the similar systematic residua are also present _ outside _ the eclipses and as such may be attributed to some defects of the photometry and not to the model itself .",
    "the final error was eventually derived as a sum of all the partial errors in quadrature .",
    "the cepheid is the largest at the pulsation phase @xmath15 reaching @xmath16 and the smallest at the pulsation phase @xmath17 shrinking to @xmath18 .",
    "+    the rotation is derived from the broadening function calculated for all the spectra where the components are well - separated .",
    "the profile is wide and the instrumental broadening seems to be of secondary importance .",
    "we assumed that the rotation axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "the derived value of the projected rotational velocity of the secondary @xmath19 km / s is consistent with its pseudosynchronous rotation of 10.4 km / s .",
    "the rotational velocity of the primary is strongly affected by the atmospheric turbulence originating from the pulsations , so we do not determine this parameter here .",
    "it is worth to mention that the new radius , mass and luminosity estimates do agree within one sigma with the recent pulsation and evolutionary prescriptions .",
    "the presented method proofed to be a good tool for the analysis of eclipsing binaries with radially pulsating components .",
    "it allows for a consistent treatment of the photometric and spectroscopic data  calculating the pulsating component radius change we make use of both of them . as a result",
    ", very precise measurements of the physical parameters of a cepheid variable and its companion were obtained .",
    "we fully confirmed the findings of pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , especially the reported mass and radius values of the classical cepheid ogle - lmc - cep-0227 .",
    "our masses for both components and the radius of the secondary are well within 1-@xmath20 error bars given by pietrzyski et al .",
    "a slight difference occurs for the cepheid mean radius which is about @xmath21 larger in our solution .",
    "we do not think that to be significant because we have analyzed here a much larger set of observations and the previous analysis was based on the approximate removal of the pulsations from the light curve .",
    "our mean radius is in perfect agreement with the cepheid period - radius relation of gieren et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and marginally consistent with groenewegen ( 2013 ) calibration .",
    "the present analysis of the _ spitzer _ data excludes the possibility of the additional third light in the near - infrared larger than @xmath22 . because the level of the third light detected in the i - band is also low",
    "we conclude that there is no significant k - band excess in this system as well .",
    "the observed disk of the cepheid surface seems to be heavily darkened , especially in the optical region where corresponding linear ld coefficient is @xmath23 .",
    "it is at odds with the limb darkening coefficient predicted for the static atmosphere at the temperature @xmath24 k , the gravity @xmath25 and the metallicity @xmath26fe / h@xmath27=-0.5 $ ] , namely @xmath28 ( van hamme 1993 ) .",
    "such a strong limb darkening may arise from the high degree of turbulence in the pulsating atmosphere of the cepheid and from the presence of very deep and profound convective cells more typical for a late k - type giant .    according to our knowledge",
    "the method we have used for deriving the projection factor is the first one of this kind reported in the literature .",
    "it is also a second time , in a general case of short period cepheids , that the individual value is precisely determined after the interferometric measurements for @xmath7 cep ( mrand et al . 2005 ) .",
    "our value of the projection factor @xmath29 is close to the @xmath9-factor determined by mrand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xmath30 .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2013 ) basing on the hydrodynamic models of the ogle - lmc - cep-0227 derived the @xmath9-factor @xmath31 , in good agreement with our empirical determination .",
    "however , their models were fitted to the pulsation light curves of the cepheid which were freed from the companion light contribution according to our photometric light curve solution .",
    "thus , their value of the @xmath9-factor is not fully independent .",
    "there are two substantial advantages of our method in comparison with the approach presented by mrand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) making it less prone to systematics .",
    "first , our projection factor is distance independent .",
    "second , only weak dependence on the limb darkening assumptions is present . in fact ,",
    "limb darkening coefficients are fitted simultaneously , but independently to the @xmath9-factor .",
    "let us emphasize here that in deriving the interferometric angular diameters one need to convert uniform disk diameters @xmath32 into limb darkened ones @xmath33 . for @xmath7 cep",
    "the conversion was done using the theoretical limb darkening tables for ordinary ( non - pulsating ) stars . however , in a view of the peculiar limb darkening we have found for the cep-0227 such procedure may be called into question .",
    "of course there are some other sources of possible systematics in our solution .",
    "first of all , the question if jktebop can adequately represent the surfaces of giant stars . comparison made with the wilson - devinney code ( graczyk et al .",
    "2012 ) , which is still the most elaborated program for the analysis of eclipsing binaries , suggests that for well detached binaries ( as our cep-0227 ) the solutions returned by both codes are very similar . if any systematics connected with the use of jktebop exists , most probably it is shared by other computer tools for modeling eclipsing binaries .",
    "some systematics may arise also from the assumptions of constant limb darkening and projection factor during the whole pulsation cycle .",
    "the validation of both assumption is currently under work and will be presented in another paper .",
    "the application of the light travel time effect was important in the analysis . for our object",
    "it barely affected our derived parameters but the overall fit was significantly better removing some systematic residuals .",
    "for some other objects like ogle - lmc - cep-1812 we expect the effect to have an even higher impact on the solution .    in summary",
    "we conclude that the presented method allowed us not only to improve the precision of the determination of the intrinsic and structural parameter of the binary system and the pulsating component in particular , but also to measure some other characteristics like limb - darkening and the p - factor .",
    "it has a great potential for the application to other binary systems with radially pulsating components .",
