    "@xcite , while lately cpt and lorentz non - invariant extensions of the standard model were scrutinized in ref . @xcite .",
    "as many breaking terms are allowed , most efforts have been focused on the possible constraints coming from experimental data @xcite as well as from renormalizability requirements and anomaly cancellation . in this context",
    ", there arose a `` theoretical '' controversy on the possibility of generating , through radiative corrections , a chern - simons like term in the effective action of qed .",
    "there lorentz and ctp symmetries can be in fact destroyed by considering a term of the form _",
    "^a _ f _ , [ chern ] where @xmath4 is a constant vector .",
    "this breaking term , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , predicts birifrangence of the light in the vacuum and observations on distant galaxies put a very stringent bound on @xmath4 @xcite . on the other hand the superstring inspired extensions of the standard model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite contain , in the fermionic sector , a lorentz- and cpt - violating axial - vector coupling _",
    "b = b_|^_5 , [ axial ] with @xmath0 a constant , prescribed four - vector that couples to the usual axial - current of qed . the interaction term @xmath5 could generate , through radiative corrections , a non - vanishing value for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if this were the case , the strong bounds on @xmath4 would translate into strong bounds for the non - invariant term ( [ axial ] ) .",
    "the aforementioned controversy arises from the fact the calculation is plagued by a dependence on the regularization adopted . while some papers @xcite claim that particular methods offer the correct result , others argue that the requirement of vector gauge invariance forces a vanishing induced term @xcite . recently",
    "this issue was also discussed in @xcite in the heat kernel approach . a rather lucid discussion of the problem appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out that the relevant form of the vectorial ward identities may depend on how the vector @xmath0 is embedded into ( or derived from ) a more fundamental theory . as an example of that in @xcite it was proposed an axion - like model to generate @xmath0 as vev of a dynamical field : there , a weaker form of the vectorial ward identity governs the appearance of the interaction ( [ chern ] ) in the effective action , and , in particular , it is not strong enough to ensure the vanishing of its coefficient . in any case , when @xmath0 is considered a strictly constant non - dynamical vector field , only vectorial ward identities with vanishing axial momentum are relevant and they do not fix the actual value of the coefficient of the chern - simons term : it depends on the renormalization condition .",
    "our interest is instead devoted to a different feature of the problem : the purpose of this letter is in fact to study the effect of a thermal bath on the structure of the chern - simons like term ( [ chern ] ) , obtained by integrating out fermions coupled to the axial - vector @xmath0 .",
    "in particular our starting observation is that regularization ambiguities can not modify temperature dependence , since they are related to the ultraviolet behavior of the theory , that is temperature independent .",
    "renormalization conditions are usually implemented at @xmath1 , where the parameters of the theory are defined , and consequently their temperature evolution is determined .",
    "our one - loop computation may suffer , therefore , of the mentioned @xmath1 ambiguities while the functional form of the induced term and the temperature dependence of its coefficient are safe .",
    "we will use imaginary - time formalism and , for simplicity , dimensional regularization : in this scheme , where the vectorial ward identities hold even at non - zero axial - vector momentum , a consistency check of our algebra is given by the vanishing of the induced term ( [ chern ] ) in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that dimensional regularization in its standard form does not allow the appearance of the cs term at @xmath1 has been already pointed out in @xcite . on the contrary",
    "a cpt- and lorentz - violating chern - simons action _ is _ generically present at @xmath7 :",
    "while this fact may have some relevance for phenomenological application , potentially being active in the early universe , a serious question arises about the consistency of the effective theory . for time - like @xmath0",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the vacuum is unstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with finite vacuum decay rates and , recently , it was argued @xcite that , in this case , unitarity itself may be in trouble ( see also the original discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a more general analysis on the consistency of the theory at quantum level has been presented in @xcite , where both time - like and space - like cases appear to be problematic when microcausality and stability are examined .",
    "rather surprisingly our computations show that the induced term does not depend on the temporal component of @xmath0 : we have not explored up to now the dynamical consequences of this fact in our finite - temperature context . moreover",
    "invariance under small ( i.e. not wrapping around the compactified imaginary time @xcite ) vectorial gauge transformations of the induced term is easily shown due to the use of dimensional regularization .",
    "to begin with let us consider a modified qed action described by the lagrangian density = |[i/-m-_5b/-ea/ ] .",
    "[ axialqed ] as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 linear contribution to the chern - simons term arises from the photon self - energy with one insertion of the axial - vector field , ^_b(p)=i b^ , where @xmath8 is given by the `` triangle''-like graph with zero momentum axial vertex ( we are working from now on directly in euclidean space ) : i_(p)= -ie^2 . [ pai ] the cpt- and lorentz - violating chern - simons action is extracted from eq .",
    "( [ pai ] ) by isolating , from the odd - parity part , the tensorial structure linear in the external momentum and by performing the limit @xmath9 in the scalar integral multiplying it . in ref .",
    "@xcite the explicit evaluation at @xmath1 of @xmath10 in the dimensional regularization was presented .",
    "in particular it was noticed that the only algebraic properties of @xmath11 used in the computation were : a ) the trace of @xmath11 with an odd number of dirac matrices vanishes and b ) the trace of @xmath11 with an even number of dirac matrices can be reduced using the clifford algebra to the quantity @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "consistency also requires that @xmath13={\\rm tr } [ \\gamma_5]=0 $ ] .    in this zero - temperature case ,",
    "the linear @xmath14 dependence is easily extracted and the result can be presented as -ib^p^ , [ paiodd ] where the explicit form of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is given in @xcite : evaluating @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath17 dimensions , taking the limit @xmath18 and expanding in @xmath19 , it results that _ 1(p^2/m^2)+f_2(p^2/m^2)- , showing the absence of a chern - simons contribution to the effective action .",
    "we agree with this computation but we want to recall a couple of remarks in order to better appreciate the finite @xmath2 effects .",
    "first of all one can check that the cancellation of the leading order ( constant ) contribution to @xmath20 comes from a delicate balance between a `` classical '' term ( proportional to @xmath21 in eq.([pai ] ) ) and an `` anomalous '' quantum term , deriving from the potential divergences in the case of parity anomaly .",
    "this perfect balance between the two contributions is peculiar of the standard dimensional regularization . in other scheme",
    "this exact cancellation does not occur , leaving us with a non vanishing cs term whose coefficient is however temperature independent . ] . as mentioned in ref.@xcite",
    ", the massless case escapes this mechanism , therefore dimensional regularization gives there a non - vanishing result .",
    "this fact is related to the loss of analyticity @xcite of the `` triangle''-like diagram at @xmath22 in the limit of vanishing axial - vector momentum . in the finite temperature case , where the analyticity properties in the external momenta are usually weaker",
    ", this observation suggests the concrete possibility that a non - zero result could appear even in the massive case .",
    "secondly , we stress that the covariance of the momentum integration immediately selects the chern - simons tensorial structure and the dependence on @xmath19 of the coefficient function at zero - temperature .",
    "this is no longer true at finite temperature , as we shall see in a while , due to explicit presence of the matsubara frequencies : in particular the double limit @xmath23 and @xmath24 has to be performed very carefully .",
    "let us assume , from now on that the system is in thermal equilibrium with a temperature @xmath25 , @xmath26 being interpreted as the radius of the compactified euclidean time . in this case we may use the matsubara formalism that consists simply in taking @xmath27 ( anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions requires semi - integers frequencies ) and replacing @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining @xmath29 integral is of course continued to @xmath17-spatial dimensions .",
    "the trace can be still performed in full generality and simple algebraic manipulations in the loop momenta ( not involving shifts or symmetry properties ) allows us to write ( [ selfy ] ) as follows : @xmath30 the following step in the computation is to extract the tensorial structure , leaving us with the evaluation of scalar integrals . the second term in eq.([selfy ] ) is easily tamed , both the integral over the spatial components and the series over @xmath31 are anti - symmetric in exchanging @xmath32 ( we can find a region around @xmath33 where everything is convergent ) . it remains therefore -4 i_p^i_0 , where we have @xmath34 that exhibits the chern - simons like structure .",
    "let us discuss now the first contribution .",
    "we introduce feynman parameters in order to perform the integral .",
    "to implement translations only on the space components of the loop momentum we decompose @xmath4 as follows k_=_+k_0_0 . shifting @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is defined as above ) in eq.([selfy ] ) and using the covariance under spacial rotations , which allows us to conclude that @xmath37 we arrive to the form @xmath38 , \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 } { [ \\hat{k}^2+(k_0+xp_0)^2+x(1-x)p^2+m^2]^3}.   \\nonumber\\\\ i_2&=&\\int_0 ^ 1 dx\\,2(1-x)\\sum_{n}\\int \\frac{d^d\\hat k}{(2\\pi)^d } \\frac{[-p_0(k_0+xp_0)-\\frac{2}{d}\\hat{k}^2-\\frac{1}{2}p^2(1-x ) ] } { [ \\hat{k}^2+(k_0+xp_0)^2+x(1-x)p^2+m^2]^3}. \\nonumber\\\\ i_3&=&-",

    "we see that the only potential trouble comes from @xmath41 ( being @xmath42 not transverse ! ) .",

    "several comments are now in order : first of all when @xmath1 @xmath65 vanishes , recovering therefore the fact that , using dimensional regularization , no cpt- and lorentz - violating chern - simons like term is present in the effective action .",
    "the opposite limit ( @xmath67 ) is otherwise finite ( @xmath68 ) : in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar behavior was found for the temperature evolution of the coefficient of the chern - simons like term but there the @xmath1 boundary condition was taken so that at @xmath69 the symmetries were restored .",
    "moreover , at variance with our result , the chern - simons term there was implicitly assumed to be related to the @xmath70 tensorial structure , fact that from our computation turns out to be incorrect.the second point is that our induced action does not depend on the temporal component of @xmath0 ; in refs . @xcite it was discussed the consistency of the theory at quantum level , when the chern - simons like action is present .",
    "it would be interesting to address the problem of stability in the finite - temperature situation considering our induced term .",
    "another observation is related to the dependence on @xmath71 : we see that the limit @xmath72 is the same as @xmath73 ( since the only dependence on the mass and on the temperature appears through @xmath71 ) .",
    "this suggests that the presence at finite temperature of a non - zero cs - like term is related to the loss of analyticity in external momenta , bypassing therefore the argument of coleman and glashow @xcite against it ( analyticity was also assumed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to write down the induced term in configuration space @xmath74\\ ] ] gauge invariance is achieved via bianchi identity up to a total derivative .",
    "the asymmetrical behavior played in the above action by the `` spacial '' and `` temporal '' component of @xmath0 ( the latter being completely absent ) might seem strange . a source of this asymmetry can be surely traced back to the presence of a thermal bath which , selecting a specified frame , provides an additional lorentz violation .",
    "however , below , with the help of the analogous problem in two dimensions , we would like to suggest that the origin of this term at finite temperature may be related to a deeper geometrical reason . in d=2 ,",
    "in fact , its structure and its coefficient can be easily understood through the interplay of the global part of the quillen anomaly , which controls the obstruction to the chiral splitting , and the presence of a non trivial cycle ( finite temperature in the above language ) .    there , the relevant green function is the 1-point function with one @xmath0-insertion ( we study the massless case for simplicity ) . using dimensional regularization",
    "we see that the zero - temperature computation gives a vanishing result because @xmath75 ( we remark that having @xmath0 constant implies that the external momentum has to be null ) . but turning on the temperature the situation changes drastically .",

    "the term appearing eq .",
    "( [ amv ] ) is nothing but a remnant of the holomorphic anomaly on the torus @xcite .",
    "in fact , when non - trivial cycles are present in the base - space , the effective action acquires a subtle dependence on the harmonic part of the gauge potentials .",
    "in particular when both vector and axial gauge fields are coupled , requiring gauge invariance implies that an anomalous phase has to be present in order to cure the transformation properties of the modulus of the dirac determinant .",
    "this phase can be derived from general algebraic - geometrical arguments @xcite , being related to the quillen anomaly , or by an explicit @xmath82function computation @xcite of the relevant functional determinants .",
    "the asymmetric character of the phase has to be ascribed to the anomalous modular transformation properties of chiral partition functions .",
    "we can now understand the appearance of this term at finite temperature : @xmath0 is basically an harmonic one - form axially coupled and therefore being able to interact with the harmonic component of @xmath83 .",
