    "advanced interferometric gravitational - wave detectors are currently under construction and are expected to start delivering strain data in a few years .",
    "major improvements over the first - generation interferometers will include a significantly better sensitivity curve at all frequencies of interest , which will effectively shift the sensitive band lower boundary from @xmath1 hz to @xmath2 hz @xcite .",
    "a promising source of gravitational - wave detections in the advanced interferometer era is represented by the inspiral and coalescence of compact binary systems , such as binary neutron stars ( bns ) , binary black holes and black hole - neutron star binaries @xcite .",
    "the strain waveform associated with such events can be calculated to a good approximation at least for some regions of the parameter space describing the binary system @xcite .",
    "consequently , the classical data analysis pipeline for detecting such signals employs a filter matched to the analytical waveform @xcite .",
    "this approach consists in correlating the strain data with the waveform and producing an estimate of the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for that waveform .",
    "triggers are then generated whenever the snr exceeds a pre - defined threshold .",
    "lists of triggers are independently produced for each detector and combined to obtain coincident triggers , which are then checked for consistency and passed on to more elaborate analysis .",
    "similar search pipelines will be employed in the advanced detector era . however , in order to exploit the improved noise curves and extend the search to lower frequencies , the strain data will have to be filtered with significantly longer inspiral waveforms than used for past searches ( up to tens of minutes as opposed to about one minute for bns ) .",
    "in fact , the duration of the waveform in the interferometer output depends strongly on the low - frequency cutoff @xcite .",
    "first generation interferometers were affected by high rates of short - duration transients unrelated to astrophysical events and commonly known as _ glitches _ , most of which can be roughly modeled as short sine - gaussian waveforms with a few cycles , i.e.  a small @xmath0-factor @xcite . the typical effect of glitches on searches for binary coalescence is a significant deviation of the snr distribution from what expected for stationary gaussian noise , i.e.  an exponential distribution . in particular , glitches produce tails of high - snr outliers unrelated to astrophysical signals .",
    "this increases the false - alarm rate of the search and lowers our confidence on possible detections of true inspiral signals ( see @xcite , figure 8) . in past searches ,",
    "most glitches were ruled out as gravitational - wave candidates by monitoring _",
    "auxiliary channels _ and their origin could rather be attributed either to the noisy environment of the detector ( for instance seismic noise , weather , electromagnetic disturbances ) or to unexpected behavior of the detector itself ( saturation of analog - to - digital converters , problems with control systems and thermal compensation , scattered light ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , surviving glitches still increased the rate of coincident triggers between detectors and thus weakened our ability to both confidently detect signals as well as set strong upper limits on the coalescence rate . unfortunately , despite the improved sensitivity , advanced detectors are expected to manifest similar glitches in their output .",
    "this will still pose significant challenges to future gravitational - wave searches and could in fact be their ultimate limiting factor .",
    "hence , studies investigating the effect of data quality on searches play a central role in future results .",
    "a potential complication of advanced inspiral searches is the fact that the longer bns inspiral filters could lead to significant time delays between the occurrence of a short , isolated glitch and the coalescence time of the resulting spurious inspiral trigger .",
    "often , such delays will be much longer than the glitch itself and they may have an impact both on existing veto procedures based on auxiliary channels and on the tuning of consistency checks such as allen s @xmath3 @xcite , bank @xmath3 and auto @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "being able to predict the parameters of spurious inspiral triggers produced by glitches is important for understanding such issues and could hint at new veto techniques for reducing false - alarms produced by glitches .",
    "for this reason , we study the effect of glitches with sine - gaussian waveform on a matched - filter search for inspiral gravitational waves in the advanced detector era .",
    "we present approximations to the complex matched - filter output and to the snr time series ( the quantity used for producing the inspiral triggers ) for the case where the signal is just a noiseless sine - gaussian with no additional signal components on top of it .",
    "given the parameters of the glitch model ( central time @xmath4 , central frequency @xmath5 and quality factor @xmath0 ) such approximations allow one to predict the snr and time of the resulting spurious triggers as a function of the chirp mass @xmath6 of each template .",
    "we present three such approximations which complement each other and completely cover the parameter space of the sine - gaussians .",
    "we support the approximations with numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the matched filter algorithm and fix the relevant notation . in section 3",
    "we derive the approximated estimates for the snr time series and trigger parameters . in section 4",
    "we compare these results to numerical simulations and we identify regimes where the different approximations are no longer acceptable .",
    "section 5 discusses the implications of our results and suggests a way to use such results for constructing a veto procedure for the advanced era .",
    "a matched filter search combines a detector strain data segment @xmath7 , the signal to be sought @xmath8 and the one - sided power spectral density ( psd ) of the detector noise @xmath9 into a quantity representing the snr as a function of the parameters describing the gravitational - wave source @xcite .",
    "the snr for a binary coalescing at time @xmath10 is calculated as and omit other parameters . ] @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the output of the complex matched filter , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the sensitivity of the detector to the sought after signal , @xmath15 in the above expressions , @xmath16 is the fourier transform of the pre - conditioned data segment and @xmath17 is the inspiral signal template expressed in the frequency domain via the stationary phase approximation @xcite . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are frequency cutoff values .",
    "searches performed on first - generation detector data used @xmath20 hz and for advanced interferometers @xmath21 hz is expected .",
    "@xmath19 is usually set to the frequency corresponding to the innermost stable circular orbit of a test mass orbiting a schwarzschild black hole , i.e.  @xmath22 .    candidate inspiral triggers are identified as local maxima of the snr crossing a pre - established threshold .",
    "each trigger carries the set of associated parameter values , e.g.  coalescence time and phase and binary component masses .",
    "we are interested in calculating the response of the inspiral matched filter to a sine - gaussian waveform , i.e.  the snr time series @xmath23 after the center time of the sine - gaussian . from @xmath23",
    "we then want to estimate the maximum snr @xmath24 and the corresponding time @xmath25 .",
    "the signal we consider includes only a sine - gaussian glitch : neither the stochastic noise of the detector nor any kind of astrophysical gravitational wave signals are added .",
    "therefore , our results will represent averages over the ensemble of noise realizations .",
    "they will also not describe the case of a glitch contaminating a true inspiral signal .",
    "the sine - gaussian waveform can be written in the time domain as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an overall amplitude , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the location of the sine - gaussian in time and frequency respectively , @xmath28 is the time duration , @xmath0 is the dimensionless quality factor and @xmath29 is the phase of the oscillation at @xmath30",
    ". we are free to define the time origin as @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 represents the time delay between the sine - gaussian and the inspiral trigger .",
    "since the snr is linear in the signal amplitude , we can also set @xmath33 .",
    "the sine - gaussian can then be expressed in the frequency domain as @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{sgfreqdom}\\ ] ] for @xmath35 , the second exponential falls off very quickly as @xmath0 increases from 1 , so we neglect it altogether .",
    "we can now also set @xmath36 since the snr is not affected by global phase factors .",
    "inserting and the so - modified into we get @xmath37 in order to get an explicit expression , we approximate @xmath38 with the simple _ newtonian chirp _",
    "@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath10 is the coalescence time , @xmath40 is the orbital phase at coalescence , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the chirp mass of the binary system composed of masses @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "although the resulting integral can not be evaluated exactly , different approximations can be found , as will be discussed in the next subsections .",
    "the first approximation we describe makes use of the stationary phase approximation .",
    "if @xmath45 at a frequency @xmath46 , we can approximate @xmath38 around @xmath46 with a second order power series , @xmath47 for the newtonian chirp this holds and we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the first _ chirp time _ evaluated using @xmath5 as the fiducial frequency @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath46 is a function of the coalescence time and we are evaluating a family of integrals parametrized by @xmath10 .",
    "the factor @xmath50 in varies more slowly with frequency than the exponential , so we take it as constant and evaluate it at @xmath46 .",
    "the integrand can then be rewritten as the product of two gaussians , one real and one complex , so the matched filter output is ( omitting irrelevant phase factors ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the standard deviations of the gaussians . using and in , and carrying out the integral using cauchy s theorem",
    ", we get @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "this is a complicated function of @xmath10 through @xmath46 and @xmath56 . in particular note",
    "that @xmath10 also enters via @xmath57 and so the shape of the snr pulse in time depends on the psd of the noise .",
    "although @xmath9 can in principle be modeled as a combination of power laws , the resulting expression is complicated and a numerical maximization is thus needed in order to determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "our second method is a slightly different application of the stationary phase approximation and is expected to be appropriate for small @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we still use but we now assume that the largest contribution to the integral in comes from a narrow band around @xmath46 . within this band , we can thus consider all other terms of the integrand constant and equal to their value at @xmath46 , including the sine - gaussian peak , so the integral reduces to @xmath58 therefore , omitting all irrelevant phase terms , @xmath59 and the resulting snr time series is @xmath60 for the newtonian chirp , @xmath61 this is still a quite complicated function of time and it still depends on the psd of the noise . in general , at least for a smooth psd with no peaks , it is the product of two peaks with different time scales , one corresponding to the exponential term and the other associated with the @xmath62 term .",
    "thus @xmath25 depends on @xmath5 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the details of @xmath9 even for the newtonian chirp .",
    "although we expect approximation ii to be valid for small @xmath0 , we can try to take the result to the limit of @xmath65 .",
    "the exponential becomes more peaked than the @xmath66 term , so @xmath23 is maximum where @xmath67 and @xmath68 this suggests that in the large @xmath0 limit the trigger delay is just the time the inspiral takes to coalesce after crossing the center frequency of the sine - gaussian , which can be expected from intuition . as we said",
    ", however , this approximation is expected to work for small @xmath0 and thus in general @xmath24 and @xmath25 must be found numerically .",
    "although probably less useful in practice , a different approximation can be derived in the large @xmath0 limit . in this regime",
    "the integrand in is no longer dominated by the band around @xmath46 but by the narrow peak of the sine - gaussian , centered on @xmath5 .",
    "again , the factor @xmath50 varies slowly with frequency and can be regarded as constant , and the integral limits can be extended over the real axis .",
    "we still approximate the template phase as a second - order taylor series , but this time around @xmath5 , @xmath69 for instance , for the newtonian chirp we have @xmath70 after switching the integration variable to @xmath71 , and omitting irrelevant phase factors , we are left with a gaussian integral @xmath72 which readily gives @xmath73 the final expression for the approximated snr time series is @xmath74 in the case of the newtonian chirp @xmath75 is the only function of @xmath10 , so @xmath23 is a simple gaussian pulse and we obtain explicit expressions for trigger snr and time , @xmath76 note that @xmath25 is consistent with approximation ii taken in the limit of large @xmath0 , but @xmath24 is not and we expect approximation iii to give the correct result in this case .",
    "we test the accuracy of the approximations by numerically computing the response of an inspiral matched filter to noiseless sine - gaussians injected in the time domain . for @xmath9 we take the noise psd corresponding to advanced ligo s _ zero detuning , high power _",
    "configuration , an approximation of which is provided by the lalsimulation module of lalsuite @xcite . for simplicity , and in order to work well within the numerical range of the floating - point representation , we set the amplitude of the simulated sine - gaussian to 1 and at the same time we scale the noise psd by @xmath77 ; therefore , the resulting trigger snr refers to sine - gaussians with an amplitude of @xmath78 .",
    "we scan the @xmath79 parameter space in the region @xmath80 , @xmath81 for total mass values of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for each point , we compute the maximum snr @xmath24 and the delay @xmath25 between the maximum snr and the center of the injected sine - gaussian , and we compare to the predicted values",
    ". results for approximation i , ii and iii can be seen in figure [ contours_approx_i ] , [ contours_approx_ii ] and [ contours_approx_iii ] respectively .    , @xmath0 or @xmath85.,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath0 or @xmath85.,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath0 or @xmath85.,title=\"fig : \" ]    , as expected . remarkably however , the predicted trigger time is good for most of the explored parameter space.,title=\"fig : \" ] , as expected .",
    "remarkably however , the predicted trigger time is good for most of the explored parameter space.,title=\"fig : \" ] , as expected .",
    "remarkably however , the predicted trigger time is good for most of the explored parameter space.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    approximation i works well for both @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but it degrades for large values of @xmath5 , @xmath0 or mass . in particular",
    ", we find that surfaces of constant accuracy roughly match those of constant @xmath86 ; the 5% accuracy for snr , at least in the explored parameter range , is at @xmath87 s@xmath88 .",
    "this is likely not a major problem , as we expect most glitches to last at most tens of cycles and affect mostly low frequencies .",
    "moreover , at high frequency or mass the time delay is small and thus the problem we are considering is less important . also note that neglecting the second exponential of produces no noticeable effects even for @xmath89 .",
    "approximation ii produces excellent estimates of the time delay across all the explored parameter space , but wrong estimates of snr for large @xmath0 , as can be expected .",
    "in fact , as @xmath0 increases , the sine - gaussian peak in the frequency domain shrinks and at some point the integral is no longer dominated by the region around @xmath46 .",
    "since we are interested in the low-@xmath0 region , despite this problem this is still a useful approximation , although not significantly simpler than i.    as expected , approximation iii works very well in the high mass , high @xmath0 region where the other two approximations do not give such good results .",
    "moreover it is analytically simpler . but",
    "for a large region of the parameter space where @xmath0 is small , this approximation fails and so is not so useful for a large part of the parameter space of interest .",
    "this is because the width of the gaussian in the frequency domain becomes comparable or larger than the width of the other terms in the integrand and the approximation is not valid .",
    "however , in this part of the parameter space we can simply revert to approximations i and ii .",
    "although our calculations are based on the newtonian chirp , search pipelines use inspiral waveforms with higher post - newtonian order @xcite .",
    "thus we also check the accuracy of the approximations against simulations using a 3.5pn inspiral filter .",
    "we find that the accuracy degrades but is still within a few percent both for @xmath24 and @xmath25 and it retains a similar dependency on @xmath5 , @xmath0 and @xmath85 .",
    "an example for a @xmath83 equal - mass binary is shown in figure [ contours_approx_i_3pn ] . since our approximations",
    "are based simply on power - series approximations of the inspiral phase , they can in principle accommodate high post - newtonian order waveforms , at the price of more complicated expressions for @xmath23 .    .",
    "the left plot is the trigger snr , the right one is the trigger delay .",
    "the dashed line is the isco frequency . ]    in a search pipeline , the parameter space of the binary is covered by a template bank .",
    "a true inspiral signal produces triggers only for templates whose parameters are close enough to the true values , depending on the ambiguity function of the waveform .",
    "however , a strong glitch generally excites a significant fraction of the whole bank , producing a cluster of triggers with different snrs and times .",
    "an example of this phenomenon is shown in figure [ cluster ] , where we plot the distribution of triggers in @xmath90 corresponding to a sine - gaussian glitch affecting a simplified template bank with uniform distribution in total mass .",
    "the dependency of snr and time delay on the template mass determines the shape of the cluster .",
    "low - mass templates produce the triggers with the largest delay and smallest snr .",
    "the last triggers can be delayed by several minutes , which is much longer than the duration of the glitch ( typically seconds or fractions of a second ) .    , @xmath91 hz and @xmath92 .",
    "the bank consists of 50 3.5pn , equal - mass waveforms with @xmath85 uniformly spaced in @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "the cluster extends well after the duration of the glitch , with the lowest mass templates still producing triggers minutes after the glitch . ]",
    "again we stress that , since we considered the response of the matched filter to a noiseless sine - gaussian glitch , the predicted coalescence time and snr represent expectation values . triggers produced by glitches in real data will have parameters distributed around our prediction .",
    "in particular we expect that , in the limit of high snr , such distributions will tend to gaussians centered on our prediction .",
    "the length of low - mass inspiral filters represents a potential problem for future inspiral searches and in particular for low - latency bns pipelines such as mbta @xcite and lloid @xcite .",
    "in fact , as evident from this study , short glitches with sine - gaussian - like waveforms can produce low - mass triggers well after their occurrence time . combined with the fact that a glitch can have significant overlap with a large fraction of the template bank",
    ", this implies that a single glitch can produce a cluster of many spurious triggers spanning a time interval of several minutes .",
    "although we found that the trigger snr effectively decreases with increasing delay , glitches can be very strong and still produce triggers with a large delay and snr above the detection threshold .",
    "consistency tests such as allen s @xmath3 @xcite , bank @xmath3 and auto @xmath3 @xcite are most effective for long waveforms and would likely rule out a large fraction of such spurious triggers .",
    "a detailed investigation of the response and effectiveness of these tests with respect to sine - gaussian waveforms is a necessary followup of this work and could provide hints at how to optimally tune the parameters of such tests for this particular glitch model .",
    "unfortunately however , the efficiency of consistency tests also decreases with decreasing snr .",
    "triggers with large delay and snr just above the detection threshold will therefore still be problematic and the usual veto procedures based on auxiliary channels will be required . for past searches , such procedures consisted in identifying glitches in one or more auxiliary channels and excluding inspiral triggers within an appropriate coincidence window . while this method is applicable in the case of short inspiral filters , though , its naive application to future low - mass searches would remove all triggers within hundreds or thousands of seconds around each glitch , significantly reducing the live time of the experiment .",
    "we presented three approximations which allow one to predict the snr and time of spurious triggers generated by an inspiral matched filter responding to sine - gaussian glitches .",
    "such formulae effectively map the parameters of the glitch and the chirp mass of the template to the snr and time of the resulting spurious trigger . in other words , they represent the first step in understanding false inspiral triggers produced by isolated , sine - gaussian glitches .",
    "we compared them to numerical simulations and investigated their validity in the region of @xmath94 parameter space relevant for advanced detectors .",
    "together they complement each other , providing full coverage of the explored region .",
    "the formulae can be used for vetoing spurious low - mass triggers in the following way .",
    "assuming we have knowledge of a non - astrophysical , sine - gaussian - like excitation in the strain data  either from a burst search pipeline such as omega @xcite , or by identifying excitations in auxiliary channels with known couplings to the strain channel @xcite  we can predict for each template the snr and time of the resulting inspiral triggers .",
    "we can then scan the list of triggers produced by the inspiral search and look for the ones matching the predicted snr and time , within a coincidence window accounting for the uncertainty in the prediction due , for instance , to the detector noise .",
    "triggers found in coincidence with the prediction can then be associated with the glitch and selectively removed . alternatively ,",
    "if enough coincident triggers are found , the portion of strain data corrupted by the glitch can be removed  for instance by replacing it with gaussian noise  and the inspiral search repeated .",
    "this would essentially remove the whole cluster of triggers produced by the glitch without sacrificing a segment of analysis time as long as the longest filter .",
    "the more precise definition , implementation and testing of this procedure constitute another natural followup of this paper .",
