    "in this study we again revisit the question of a possible correlation between the presence of doppler - detected planets and host star li abundance .",
    "several studies @xcite indicate that stars with planets ( swps ) have lower li abundances compared to stars without detected planets near the solar temperature",
    ". however , other studies @xcite have failed to confirm this pattern",
    ". therefore , despite having received attention for over a decade from several inpedendent research groups , this question remains controversial .",
    "the present work is very similar to @xcite , but we increases the size of the sample of comparison stars with new spectroscopic data and also add additional literature data . in @xcite we showed that swps in the temperature ( t@xmath0 ) range @xmath1 t@xmath2 k are deficient in li by about 0.5 dex relative to comparison stars with similar properties .",
    "that study also revealed weaker evidence that swps with t@xmath3 k are deficient in li .",
    "however , relatively few comparison stars with t@xmath4 k and t@xmath3 k were employed in that study .",
    "we have targeted comparison stars in these ranges in the present work .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to test again the claim that the li abundances of sun - like swps are different than those of similar stars without known planets . in section 2",
    "we describe our new spectroscopic observations and li abudance analyses . in section 3",
    "we compare swps and stars without detected planets .",
    "we discuss the results in section 4 and present the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we observed 30 stars without detected planets selected from the @xcite study of field dwarfs .",
    "only one of them , hd 162826 , was already included as a comparison star in one of our previous studies @xcite ; it was observed on two nights .",
    "none of the other stars in our program have previously determined li abundances .",
    "the values of t@xmath0 listed by @xcite for our program stars range from 5630 to 6274 k , and the average is near 5950 k. we observed our target stars on may 9 - 12 , 2014 using the mcdonald observatory 2.1-m otto struve telescope and sandiford spectrograph , which is a cassegrain echelle design @xcite .",
    "the instrument setup , observing procedures and analysis steps are nearly identical to those used in our previous observing run for this program and are described in @xcite .",
    "a solar spectrum was obtained via reflected light off the galilean moon ganymede , and the hot star regulus was observed in order to correct for telluric features .    as in @xcite",
    "we reduced the spectra in iraf and measured the equivalent widths in an automated way using daospec @xcite .",
    "the stellar atmosphereic parameters and li abundances were calculated using moog .",
    "we used the same linelist and atomic parameters as in @xcite .",
    "we list the results of our fe line analysis in table 1 .",
    "unfortunately , we were only able to set upper limits on the li abundance for most of the cooler stars in our new sample .",
    "most of the li detections are for stars hotter than t@xmath5 k.    comparing our results to those of @xcite , we find that the mean @xmath6t@xmath7 k and the mean @xmath6log g @xmath8 dex ( in the sense of our values minus theirs ) .",
    "both offsets are small , and in each case the scatter of the differences is consistent with the uncertainties quoted in the studies .",
    "as noted above , there is one star in common between the present work and our previous studies , hd 162826 .",
    "the stellar parameters determined in the two studies are consistent with each other within the quoted uncertainties . for the purpose of the analysis presented below in section 3",
    ", we will use a weighted average set of parameters determined for this star .",
    "the derived parameters for each star are listed in the last three columns of table 1 .",
    "they were determined using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the mean difference between our spectroscopic log g values and the parallax - derived ( photometric ) values is 0.06 @xmath9 0.10 dex . within the quoted error ,",
    "the photometric log g values are consistent with the spectroscopic values .",
    "only one star from the present work , hd 162826 , is included in @xcite , which is a compilation of li abundances for 1381 fgk dwarf and subgiant stars determined by them and also drawn from the literature .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we present the results of our analysis of high quality spectra of 30 f and g dwarfs , including li abundances .",
    "the new stars analyzed in this work were selected , for the most part , to increase the number of comparison stars with t@xmath10 k. when combined with a large homogeneous sample of similar stars with li abundance determinations from the literature , we were able to confirm that the li abundances of swps with t@xmath11 k are significantly smaller than those of stars without detected planets ; there is weaker evidence that li is also deficient among swps with t@xmath10 k. lithium is deficient among all the swps in our literature dataset by 4@xmath12 to 5@xmath12 , depending on how the samples are compared .",
    "our results generally confirm other recent independent studies of li abundances in swps @xcite .",
    "like @xcite , we have drawn attention to swp - non - swp pairs with very similar properties , yet with very different li abundances .",
    "these cases are very unlikely to be explained by observational error .",
    "they deserve additional detailed study .",
