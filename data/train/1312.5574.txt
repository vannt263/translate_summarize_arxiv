    "in an attempt to describe gravity of a central mass at large distances and explain certain satellite anomalies grumiller @xcite gave a new metric in static spherically symmetric ( sss ) spacetimes .",
    "the anomaly refers to the test particle behavior in the field of pairs , such as sun - pioneer spacecraft , earth - satellites etc .",
    "and therefore it is of utmost importance @xcite .",
    "the ansatz of sss , naturally reduces the problem effectively to a two - dimensional system where the newtonian central force modifies into @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the central gravitating mass while @xmath2 is known as the rindler acceleration parameter . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the two forces are both toward center while @xmath4 gives an outward repulsive force . throughout our analysis in this paper",
    "we shall be using @xmath3 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "in particular , the attractive mysterious force acting on the pioneer spacecrafts ( 10/11 ) launched in 1972 / 73 which could not be accounted by any known physical law came to be known as the pioneer anomaly .",
    "we must add that a recent proposal based on thermal heat loss of the satellite may resolve the anomaly @xcite . among other proposals modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) in the outer space attracted also interest .",
    "the fact that the rindler force is a constant one dashes hopes to treat it as a perturbation due to other sources ( or planets ) .",
    "further , the non - isotropic role of parameter @xmath5 differs it from the cosmological constant .",
    "although it remains still open to investigate about the physical source that gives rise to such a term , herein we wish to study geodesics in the resulting spacetime . as a matter of fact in a separate study",
    "we have shown consistently that the rindler acceleration parameter can be attributed to non - linear electrodynamics ( ned ) @xcite ( [ 4a ] ) and to a space - filling fluid in @xmath6 gravity @xcite ( [ 4b ] ) .",
    "in such a formalism the weak ( and strong ) energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "such nice features , however , are not without pay off : global monopoles emerge as complementary objects to the energy conditions @xcite ( [ 4a ] ) . for vanishing rindler acceleration , @xmath7",
    ", all results reduce to those of schwarzschild as it should .",
    "experimental estimates suggest that for the satellites @xmath8 , which suffices to yield significant differences at large distances .",
    "let us add that in the vicinity of a schwarzschild horizon @xmath9 any object feels a constant acceleration toward the black hole a l rindler .",
    "however , as stated above the rindler acceleration in question refers to large distances and for this the central object need not be a black hole .",
    "in particular such a constant acceleration at certain distances from earth ( or any other planet ) effects satellite motion to the extent that are dubbed as `` anomalies '' .",
    "it should be , added that , in order that such anomalies are universal each satellite / planet must feel it equally .",
    "so far no such anomaly is reported in objects other than the pioneer spacecrafts .",
    "the physical effects of the model proposed by grumiller have been investigated in @xcite , by studying the classical solar system tests of general relativity . in that study ,",
    "perihelion shifts , light bending and gravitational redshift were calculated for solar system planets in the presence of rindler parameter . in another study @xcite ,",
    "an alternative method has been employed to calculate the bending of light that affects the bounds on the rindler parameter .",
    "the main motivation of the present paper is to investigate the effect of the rindler parameter @xmath5 , on the trajectories of the timelike and null geodesics .",
    "our analysis shows that the rindler acceleration tends to confine the geodesics .",
    "it would not be wrong to state that , with this remarkable property finely - tuned , rindler parameter serves to have a kind of bounded cosmology .",
    "no doubts the best account of schwarzschild geodesics is given in `` the mathematical theory of black holes '' by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "being integrable systems the geodesic equations do not exhibit chaotic behavior .",
    "it is known that in some gravitational systems such as kundt type - iii and type - n spacetimes chaos is indispensable @xcite ( and references cited therein ) .",
    "the rindler modified schwarzschild spacetime on the other hand is a type - d spacetime .    in this paper",
    ", we follow a similar procedure as was done for schwarzschild metric @xcite . to be more precise , we will closely follow the method used in @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind this is to compare the effect of rindler parameter that deviates the results from the analysis performed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the review of grumiller s spacetime and its type - d character is emphasized in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "the derivation of the particles trajectorie for timelike and null geodesics with their numerical plots are presented .",
    "null geodesics in terms of elliptic functions are given in the appendix .",
    "our conclusion is given in section iv .",
    "( eq . 26 ) rises with the increasing @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior serves to confine geodesics nearer to the gravitating center .",
    ", width=340 ]    grumiller have proposed a model for gravity at large distances of a central object by assuming static and spherically symmetric system .",
    "the corresponding line element in the absence of cosmological constant is given by@xmath10where@xmath11herein @xmath1 is the mass of the central object ( or black hole ) and @xmath12 is a real constant . with @xmath13 eq .",

    "note that the signature of the metric given in ( 1 ) is changed in this section to @xmath20 , apt for the np formalism .",
    "the set of proper null tetrad @xmath21forms is given by@xmath22and the complex conjugate of @xmath23 the non - zero spin coefficients in this tetrad are@xmath24we obtain as a result , the weyl and ricci scalars as@xmath25so that the spacetime is petrov type - d .",
    "the rindler acceleration parameter is seen to effect only the ricci components , leaving the mass term @xmath26 of schwarzschild unchanged . in the so called pioneer anomaly",
    "the attractive force suggests that @xmath3 , which is the case that we shall investigate in this paper .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath27 under the choice @xmath3 which violates the energy conditions suggests also that the underlying physical source is not a familiar one . in a separate study 3 , we showed explicitly what the physical source may be , and we reached the conclusion that the arrow  indicates an unaccustomed source : the non - linear electrodynamics ( ned ) .",
