    "strong correlation effects , which imply enhanced quantum fluctuations around mean field order parameters , are playing an increasingly important role in recent experiments on dilute quantum gases . one strategy for boosting",
    "the importance of correlations and fluctuations involves the control of coupling parameters .",
    "interatomic interactions can be effectively tuned by means of magnetic feshbach resonances @xcite , allowing for a controlled transition into the non - unitary regime @xmath2 , where the effective @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath4 is larger than the average distance between particles @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the number - density of the gas .",
    "quantum fluctuations also dominate quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite where transverse confinement may be used to increase the effective coupling strength @xmath7 without explicit control of the three - dimensional @xmath3-wave scattering length . in the extreme tonks - girardeau strong - coupling regime @xmath8 ,",
    "spatial correlations dictate the impentrability of bosons , leading to ideal fermion like density distributions @xcite .",
    "an alternative to increasing effective interaction strengths , is to decrease other ( e.g. kinetic ) terms in the many - body hamiltonian . in a bose gas confined by an optical lattice ,",
    "an effective momentum cutoff is introduced by controling the barrier heights , thus suppressing the hopping frequency @xmath9 between adjacent sites . given @xmath10 particles interacting with strength @xmath11 , the strong - interaction regime is achieved for @xmath12 , as manifested in the quantum transition from a superfluid to a mott - insulator phase @xcite .    considerable theoretical effort is currently aimed at developing efficient methods for the description of correlated quantum gases far from equilibrium .",
    "one approach relies on perturbations of the lowest - order mean - field theory given by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "the result is a family of mean - field pairing theories .",
    "the standard zero - temperature bogoliubov prescription @xcite gives the natural small - oscillation modes by linearization about the gp ground - state .",
    "however , this linear response theory does not account for the backreaction of excitations on the condensate order - parameter and is thus limited to small perturbations and short timescales .",
    "backreaction is accounted for within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory , which prescribes a set of coupled equations for the condensate order - parameter and pair correlation functions @xcite .",
    "since both normal and anomalous correlations are included , this approach comes at the cost of ultraviolet divergences of anomalous quantities .",
    "while this problem is relatively easy to deal with by renormalization of the coupling parameters , a more serious issue , also related to the inclusion of anomalous correlations , is the hfb spectral gap @xcite .",
    "this unphysical gap in the excitation spectrum results in from the breaking of @xmath13 gauge symmetry and the consequent elimination of the goldstone modes corresponding to gauge transformations of the broken symmetry solution .",
    "an intermediate form between bogoliubov and hfb is the hfb - popov ( hfb - p ) approximation @xcite where @xmath13 symmetry is restored by elimination of _ noncondensate _ anomalous terms only .",
    "while the resulting theory is gapless , it does not conserve the total number of particles and is thus inadequate for describing dynamical condensate depletion . finally , if all anomalous quantities are neglected , one obtains the bosonic hartree fock ( hf ) theory @xcite which is both gapless and conserving , but does not allow for any dynamical depletion , since the populations of condensed and non - condensed particles are conserved separately .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to develop a theoretical description that ( a ) is @xmath13 invariant and hence gapless , ( b ) conserves the total number of particles , yet ( c ) allows for dynamical depletion of the condensate .",
    "recently , a perturbative approximation scheme based on a two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action expansion , has been used to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of condenstaes in optical lattices @xcite within the lowest bloch - band bose - hubbard model . within the 2pi effective action expansion ,",
    "the bogoliubov and hfb theories emerge as one - loop and a single two - loop correction respectively , to the classical gp action .",
    "higher - order approximations , obtained by including two - vertex terms in the diagramatic expansion of the effective action ( denoted as in ref .",
    "@xcite by 2nd ) and by a @xmath14 expansion up to second - order in the coupling strength ( denoted henceforth by @xmath14 ) with @xmath15 being the number of auxillary classical fields used to approximate the quantum - field , have been compared with hfb and exact few - sites numerical calculations .",
    "the results demonstrate some improvement of the higher - order approximations over hfb in predicting the exact many - body dynamics . however , at sufficiently long times all approximations fail due to interaction effects . a nonperturbative @xmath14 2pi effective action expansion approach",
    "have also been developed and applied to the equilibration of a homogeneous bose gas in 1d @xcite .    in this work",
    "we develop a mean - field theory for the description of quantum dynamics in the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the technique , referred to here as bogoliubov back reaction ( bbr ) , is a many - site extension of previous work on a two - site model @xcite , based on the perturbation of equations of motion for the reduced single - particle density operator , instead of the usual field operator approach .",
    "the resulting equations involve the two - point reduced single - particle density matrix ( spdm ) and the four - point correlation functions .",
    "they contain only normal ( _ i.e. _ number conserving ) quantities , and are thus @xmath13 symmetric .",
    "the approximation conserves the total number of particles , yet it allows for population transfer from the condensate to the excitations , thus accounting for condensate depletion during the evolution .",
    "we compare bbr calculations with full many - body numerical results for up to a hundred particles and five lattice sites , as well as with hfb and 2pi effective action results .",
    "the bbr results give better , longer - time predictions than current rival approximations , at a small fraction of the theoretical effort .    in section",
    "ii we present the bose - hubbard model and the standard hfb approach . in section iii",
    "we transform the bose - hubbard hamiltonian with @xmath0 lattice sites into an @xmath1 pseudospin problem , derive dynamical equations for the @xmath1 generators spanning the single - particle density operator , and truncate the resulting hierarchy of dynamical equations for correlation functions to obtain the bbr equations of motion .",

    "the bbr calculations give consistently longer breaktimes , with a more regular convergence pattern .",
    "the rich regime of strongly correlated many body physics , which ultracold atom experiments are now beginning to probe , will surely not be fully conquered by any simple hierarchy truncation scheme such as bbr . nor",
    "does bbr offer anything like an exact solution even to the problems to which we have applied it in this paper ; its improvements over its rivals are incremental rather than revolutionary . on the other hand",
    "it should be born in mind that incremental improvements in theory are more significant in the context of ultracold gases than in traditional condensed matter , because in the new atomic systems samples are precisely characterized , controlled , and measured , and relevant microphysics is clearly known .",
    "it is perfectly plausible in these systems that we may come to learn important qualitative principles from experimental discrepancies on the few percent level .",
    "the merits of bbr that we would like to emphasize , along with its very reasonable level of accuracy , are its simplicity and its direct relation to experimental reality .",
    "it involves only quantities which are directly observed in single- and two - particle number - conserving measurements , and it respects the fact that in current quantum gas laboratories atoms are neither created nor destroyed . and it is conceptually and computationally straightforward .    in one sense it is of course conceptually all too straightforward : like all hierarchy truncation schemes since boltzmann s , it is an uncontrolled approximation , whose accuracy is therefore arguably as much a puzzle as it is a solution .",
    "insofar as truncating a hierarchy at a deeper level is grounds for expecting higher accuracy , however , the advantage of bbr is clear : it is a truncation at fourth order in field operators , compared to only second order for hfb .",
    "deeper level truncation often involves proliferation of terms , to the point of sharply diminishing returns in accuracy versus effort ; but bbr avoids this , and manages to use fewer equations than hfb , because it eliminates all anomalous terms .",
    "why do hierarchy truncations often work as well as they do ?",
    "what determines the best way of truncating a hierarchy ?",
    "these are questions that have been raised ever since boltzmann s _ stosszahlansatz _ produced the arrow of time , but they have yet to be fully answered . with current experimental capabilities for precise and controlled measurements on ultracold gases , introducing a physically motivated alternative truncation scheme , as this paper has done , may contribute to new progress on these questions .",
    "finally , another conceptual merit of bbr is that because it is based on the single particle density matrix , rather than just the macroscopic wave function , it makes such a conceptually important quantity as the single particle entropy  the entropy of boltzmann  a basic ingredient in the theory , rather than a perturbative afterthought .",
    "rethinking entropy , heretofore mainly in the context of quantum information and computation theory , is another major thrust of current physics ; the alternative viewpoint offered by bbr may potentially be of some value in a broader conception of this project .",
