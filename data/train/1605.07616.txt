    "rotation powered pulsars are known to be sources of magnetized relativistic winds whose interaction with the ambient medium produces spectacular pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , observable from the radio to tev @xmath8-rays .",
    "when a pulsar is moving through the interstellar medium ( ism ) with a speed exceeding the ism sound speed , a cometary bow shock is expected to form . in the hydrodynamical approximation ( see , e.g. , ) the pulsar wind is confined to the interior of the contact discontinuity surface , which separates the shocked ism from the shocked pulsar wind , while the shocked ism is confined between the forward shock and contact discontinuity surfaces . the highly relativistic pulsar wind bulk flow experiences a termination shock , where the flow speed drops below the sound speed in the outflow . in the idealized case of initially isotropic wind",
    "the termination shock has a bullet shape ( see , e.g. , figure  9 in @xcite , and figures 1 and 2 in ) . in reality",
    ", pulsar winds can be highly anisotropic , with a polar component along the pulsar spin axis and an equatorial component , as demonstrated by x - ray observations of pwne created by young pulsars ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "therefore , the shape of the shocks and the nebula appearance may depend on the angle between the velocity vector and the spin axis of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "in addition , inhomogeneities in the ambient medium @xcite and ism entrainment @xcite can affect the nebula shape and properties .",
    "the ism matter is compressed and heated while passing through the forward shock , which can lead to excitation of ism atoms followed by radiative de - excitation in the shocked ism .",
    "unless the local ism ahead of the moving pulsar is strongly ionized , one can expect strong emission in lyman and balmer lines caused by collisional excitation of most abundant hydrogen atoms by fast ions and electrons in the shocked gas and by electron transfer from neutral hydrogen atoms to protons . since emission in lyman lines",
    "is strongly absorbed in the ism and the earth atmosphere , bow shocks can be most easily detected in h@xmath0 , the strongest of the balmer lines .",
    "to date the bow - shaped h@xmath0 nebulae have been detected around 9 pulsars ( see table 1 in @xcite ; br14 hereafter ) .",
    "in addition , about two dozen pulsars exhibit elongated or tail - like pwn morphologies in x - rays and radio @xcite , commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from shocked pulsar winds . however , bow shocks , expected for such pulsars , were detected in h@xmath0 from only a few of them ( psrs b1957 + 20 , j2124@xmath13358 and , possibly , b1951 + 32 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the scarcity of such `` hybrid '' bow shocks is a high degree of ionization of the ambient medium , which might be caused , in some cases , by pre - ionization of the ism by radiation from the pulsar and/or the x - ray pwn .",
    "one of the first h@xmath0 pulsar bow shocks was detected by @xcite wavelength , @xmath9 .",

    "the observations with the pr130l ( @xmath332000 ) , which provides a modest spectral resolution , were taken in the earth s shadow to reduce the geocoronal background .",
    "the 2006 observations also include hrc nuv imaging and spectroscopy with f300w and pr200l , respectively ( see @xcite for details ) .    in the 2006 campaign , for the majority of the exposures , the telescope was oriented to keep the pulsar away from the region of enhanced sbc thermal glow .",
    "as a result , the bow shock ( which , at that time , was not expected to be seen in fuv ) was outside the sbc field of view , except for a small part imaged in the detector corner . in one of the visits during the 2006 campaign the observatory experienced loss of guiding stars and simultaneous increase of the detector background .",
    "although most of the data from that visit were lost , the very first f140lp image of that visit ( see figure  [ panel ] , middle left panel ) happened to be good , with the telescope being oriented in such a way that most of the bow shock was imaged in the region of low detector background .    in the 2013 campaign the bow shock was intentionally placed outside the region of brightest sbc glow ( see figure  [ panel ] , middle right and bottom left panels ) .",
    "the observations with the f115lp ( 11502000 ) and f125lp ( 12502000 ) filters were taken in the earth shadow to reduce the geocoronal background , while the f140lp filter was used in the non - shadow parts of the respective orbits .",
    "a shorter wfc observation used the h@xmath34 filter ( f658n ) . unfortunately , because of a very bright geocoronal ly-@xmath34 background ( despite being in the earth shadow ) , we had to discard the f115lp image from further analysis .      for the j0437 pwn search , we used archival observations with the acis detector , which is more sensitive than the hrc detector and provides spectral information .",
    "there are 9 acis observations of j0437 in the _ chandra _ archive . in the earliest observation ( obsid 741 , pi pavlov ,",
    "the results are reported by @xcite ) the target was offset by 39 from the optical axis to mitigate the pile - up effect , which considerably distorted the point spread function ( psf ) and strongly complicated the search for a compact pwn .",
    "the other 8 observations were carried out by the _",
    "acis instrument team for calibration purposes .",
    "four of those observations were taken at roll angles too close to @xmath35 or @xmath36 , at which the so - called acis trailed image ( also known as `` readout streak '' ) of the bright pulsar coincides with the pulsar s sky trajectory and can mimic the expected pwn tail behind the pulsar and/or contribute to the pwn head image . among the remaining four , one observation had a very large ,",
    "nonstandard frame time of 6 s ( hence the pulsar image was strongly distorted by pileup ) and another one had a short exposure of 7.8 ks . therefore , we selected two of the calibration observations , obsids 6154 and 6155 ( 22.8 and 24.8 ks exposures , @xmath37 and @xmath38 roll angles , respectively ) for the pwn search .",
    "the data were taken on 2005 february 18 ( obsid 6154 ) and 2005 march 03 ( obsid 6155 ) in very faint telemetry format . in both observations the target",
    "was placed @xmath39 from the optical axis on acis - s3 chip , other acis chips were not activated . in obsid 6154 a 101 pixels ( 497 ) subarray was used ( frame time 0.4 s ) , while the whole chip was read out in obsid 6155 ( frame time 3 s ) .",

    "the fuv f140lp and f125lp images in figure  [ panel ] clearly reveal a bent extended structure ahead of the pulsar .",
    "its apex distance , @xmath40 ( @xmath25 cm ) , and shape are very similar to those of the h@xmath0 bow shock .",
    "to compare the fuv and h@xmath0 structures , we plotted h@xmath0 surface brightness contours , within which the brighter part of the h@xmath0 bow shock is confined in the middle - right panel of figure  [ panel ] ( the selected contour represents the level for which the h@xmath0 bow shock is not broken down into individual parts ) . since the h@xmath0 bow shock is only marginally detected in our 2013 acs / wfc f658n image ( figure  [ halpha ] ) , we used an archival soar image obtained on 2012 march 21 ( see top left panel of figure  [ panel ] ) to produce the h@xmath0 contours . because the fuv structure very closely follows the h@xmath0 structure , we conclude that it is an fuv counterpart of the h@xmath0 bow shock .",
    "the apparent thickness of the fuv bow shock at its apex is about @xmath41 , somewhat smaller than that of the h@xmath0 bow shock ( but it depends on image depth ) .",
    "the fuv shock is also seen in the ( dispersed ) sbc pr130l image of 2006 ( see bottom right panel of figure  [ panel ] ) , but no shock is detected in the hrc pr200l image , nor in the short hrc observations taken with the f300w and f555w filters in the same 2006 campaign .    ) applied .",
    "the fuv `` blob '' ( see figure  [ panel ] , mid - left panel ) is within the @xmath42 white circle .",
    "the pulsar position is shown by the cross . ]",
    "in addition to the fuv bow shock , the f140lp image from the 2006 may 1 observation reveals a `` blob '' of @xmath31@xmath43 size , overlapping with the bow shock limb ( mid - left panel of figure [ panel ] ) .",
    "the blob , centered at r.a.@xmath44 , decl.@xmath45 , is clearly resolved but appears to be amorphous , with no clear structure .",
    "it is out of the sbc fields of view in the fuv images of 2013 , but it is marginally detected in the 2013 wfc h@xmath0 image ( figure  [ halpha ] ) .",
    "the ratios of the surface brightness of the blob to that of the bow shock are @xmath312.5 and @xmath311.5 in the f140lp and h@xmath0 images , respectively .",
    "interestingly , while the bow shock was not detected in the 2006 hrc / pr200l data , the brighter uv blob was .",
    "this proves that the blob is not an artifact of the sbc detector .",
    "furthermore , the blob is not seen in the previous high - resolution h@xmath0 images ( e.g. , in the image by br14 ) , which suggest its variability .",
    "some of the archival optical / uv images ( wfpc2 f555w and f814w , acs / hrc f300w and f555w ; see table 1 for observation dates ) show a faint point source near the eastern boundary of the f140lp blob but no trace of extended emission .",
    "it remains unclear whether the point source is physically connected with the blob or it is just a projection effect .",
    "the inspection of the combined _ chandra _ acis - s image ( shown in figure  [ panel ] , top - right panel ) reveals a faint diffuse x - ray emission extending up to about @xmath6 south - east of j0437 ( i.e. , in the direction of pulsar s proper motion ) . for a conservative estimate of the detection significance",
    ", we extracted the source and background counts from the smaller and larger sectors of the @xmath46 annulus around the pulsar position , shown by green lines in the top right panel of figure  [ panel ] .",
    "we found @xmath47 background - subtracted counts ( 110 and 230 in the source and background areas , respectively ) in the area of 13.1 arcsec@xmath48 of the smaller sector , i.e. , the extended emission ( presumably an x - ray pwn ) is detected with a @xmath49 significance .",
    "@xcite could not detect such a small , faint nebula in their 25 ks acis - s observation of 2000 may 29 ( obsid 741 ) because of strong psf degradation at the @xmath50 off - axis target position ( see section 2.2 ) , while the 20 ks hrc - i observation ( 2000 february 13 ; obsid 742 ) , also analyzed by these authors , was not deep enough for pwn detection .",
    "we fit the spectrum of the detected extended emission with the absorbed power - law ( pl ) model with fixed @xmath51 @xmath27 ( this value was determined by @xcite from fits of the x - ray pulsar spectrum ) .",
    "the fit yields the photon index @xmath52 and absorbed flux @xmath53ergs@xmath4@xmath27 , which corresponds to luminosity @xmath54ergs@xmath4 ( at the distance of j0437 ) .",
    "we use two independent measurements to constrain the fuv spectrum for the j0437 bow shock : ( 1 ) the f140lp and f125lp imaging photometry obtained in the 2013 program ; and ( 2 ) the pr130l slitless spectroscopy from the 2006 program . for each of the two measurements we test two spectral models .",
    "first model is a simple pl continuum",
    ". it would be directly applicable to synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons with a pl spectral energy distribution , and it could crudely characterize the slope of a more complicated spectrum .",
    "second model is an fuv spectrum ( spectral lines plus continuum ) emitted from ism matter compressed and heated in the forward shock region . limited by the data quality",
    ", we have to assume that the spectrum does not vary throughout the observed bow shock region .",
    "we selected the same source and background extraction regions for the f125lp and f140lp images ( shown in figure  [ panel ] , middle - right and bottom - left panels , respectively ) .",
    "one of the two background regions was selected outside the bow shock to avoid the bow shock emission inside the bow . however , the background from this region ( hereafter , 1-sided background ) may be lower than the background at the bow shock location because of the nonuniform thermal glow contribution .",
    "therefore , we also selected another background region inside the bow shock and used the `` inside + outside '' region for an alternative background estimate ( hereafter , 2-sided background ) , which may somewhat exceed the true background because it includes a contribution from the shock emission .",

    "the black dots show the f125lp and f658n spectral fluxes ( the narrower f140lp band is contained within the f125lp one and hence it is not shown for clarity ) .",
    "the arrows show the @xmath122 upper limits for the hrc f330w and f555w observations calculated assuming a flat @xmath123 spectrum .. the horizontal black lines represent the filter widths at the half - maximum .",
    "absorbed flux densities for the pl ( @xmath124 ) and shocked plasma model ( for @xmath107kms@xmath4 and @xmath108@xmath29 ) are plotted as blue and red lines , respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed blue lines represent the @xmath125 uncertainty in the pl slope . ]",
    "another model parameter to compare with observations is the ratio of the fuv and h@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ shells_fluxes ] shows that the ratio of the model energy fluxes @xmath89@xmath118 increases with decreasing @xmath109 and becomes larger than the observed flux ratio , @xmath12615 ( corrected for extinction @xmath88 ) , at @xmath127106kms@xmath4 , depending on @xmath110 .",
    "thus , comparing the flux ratios in 3 filters , we constrain the shock speed : @xmath128kms@xmath4 , at @xmath129@xmath29 ( @xmath130kms@xmath4 at @xmath108 @xmath29 ) .",
    "we note that these constraints are derived for the effective _ plane shock _ velocity , which can be lower than the bow - shock ( pulsar ) velocity because the velocity component perpendicular to the bow shock is lower than the pulsar velocity except for the bow - shock apex .",
    "although the bow shock was not detected in the f300w and f555w images , it is interesting to compare upper limits at these wavelengths with the spectral models . due to the apparent non - uniformities in the background , clearly exceeding the statistical fluctuations",
    ", we chose to measure the upper limits by sampling the background counts from five different regions in the vicinity of the bow shock .",
    "the standard deviation of these measurements was used as a @xmath125 upper limit .",
    "the corresponding @xmath122 upper limits of the flux densities are @xmath131 and @xmath132ergs@xmath4@xmath27@xmath4 in the f330w and f555w images , respectively .",
    "figure  [ limits ] shows the best - fit pl and shocked plasma models together with the @xmath122 limits and the fuv and h@xmath0 flux density measurements .",
    "we see that the optical upper limits are too high to distinguish between the pl and shocked plasma models , but the f555w limit favors smaller values of the pl slope , @xmath133 in the broad range of @xmath0 obtained from the fuv data for the pl model ( section 3.3.1 ) .",
    "a small part of the fuv bow shock was also detected with the sbc / pr130l prism ( see figure 1 , bottom - right panel ) .",
    "even though the sbc prism is designed for spectroscopy of point sources , we attempted to analyze the prism data to check if any additional information about the bow shock spectrum can be obtained .",
    "since the bow shock is an extended feature , we had to stack the data in the cross - dispersion ( vertical ) direction before we could fit the spectrum .",
    "we shifted the image data ( using 10-pixel - wide stripes ; see figure  [ prism ] ) following the curvature of the bow shock , and summed the counts along the vertical direction , to make a one - dimensional dispersed spectrum .",
    "we halted the extraction where the dispersed image nears the detector edge . because the bow shock is resolved in the direct image along the dispersion ( horizontal ) direction , the stacked one - dimensional spectra are relatively broad ( significantly broader than the spectrum of a point source would be ) .",
    "the observed dispersed spectrum of the bow shock is thus a convolution of the spatial profile of the bow along the dispersion direction with the known throughput and dispersion of the prism . to fit the observed spectrum with a model , we follow a forward - fitting method , i.e. , calculate the dispersed pr130l spectrum ( in detector coordinates ) for a point source , convolve it with the bow shock profile measured from the direct image , and compare with the observed prism profile .",
    "while stacking multiple spectra ( figure  [ prism ] ) increases the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath134 ) , it also complicates the background subtraction . unlike a point source extraction , where the background can be estimated in the immediate vicinity of the source ,",
    "the background for each spectral extraction region ( stripes in figure  [ prism ] ) is slightly different .",
    "moreover , the thermal glow also changes across different parts of the detector .",
    "in addition , the profile from the direct image ( which is used for the model spectrum convolution ) comes from different detector coordinates than the profile from the dispersed prism image , where the background and thermal glow are different .",
    "finally , any changes in the bow shock profile or spectrum along the bow shock are not accounted for in our approach .",
    "this complicates the uncertainty estimation of our final results , and these systematic errors significantly exceed formal statistical errors obtained during the model fitting .",
    "we explored various background subtraction procedures , including a constant background and a polynomial ( with background levels rising across the dispersion direction ) .",
    "since in the interior of the bow shock we can not distinguish between the background due to the sbc thermal glow and the real emission from the bow shock itself , we decided to adopt a flat background determined from a region outside of the bow shock .",
    "although the emission is present throughout the entire sensitivity range of pr130l ( 1100@xmath11800 ) , the dispersed spectrum overlaps with the thermal glow . therefore , we restrict our fitting to the 100@xmath1300 pixel range ( figure  [ model ] ) , corresponding to the stripes shown on figure  [ prism ] .",
    "we find that under these assumptions the data can be satisfactory described by pl models with @xmath135 ( figure  [ model ] , left panel ) , which is consistent with the @xmath0 values obtained from the observations with broad filters .",
    "again , as an alternative to the simple pl model , we also used a model of emission from a collisionless plane shock @xcite . through multiple trials , we established that the models with strong individual lines produce too narrow profiles that can not fit the observed one .",
    "we concluded that models with weak lines , such as the model with @xmath107kms@xmath4 , @xmath108@xmath29 ( figure [ shock - model ] ) , are preferred by the fits ( figure [ model ] , right panel ) .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the extinction in the @xmath136@xmath10.05 range .",
    "thus , the poor statistics and smearing due to the extended nature of the bow shock do not allow us to discriminate between the pl and collisionless shock emission models in the prism spectra , but at least models in which emission is dominated by a few individual lines can be excluded .",
    "sensitive slit spectroscopy or integral field spectroscopy would be needed to reach further progress .",
    "our fuv observations of j0437 have revealed a structure whose shape matches closely ( within 05 for the leading edge ) the brighter part of the h@xmath0 bow shock ( see figure  [ panel ] ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the fuv emission is due to the interaction of the pulsar wind with the ambient ism and most likely comes from the shocked ism matter .",
    "the shocked ism matter is confined between the forward shock ( fs ) and the contact discontinuity ( cd ) , which separates the shocked ism from the shocked pulsar wind . for an isotropic pulsar wind ,",
    "the distance @xmath137 from the pulsar to the fs apex is a factor of @xmath1381.4 larger than the distance @xmath139 to the cd apex , which can be estimated as @xmath140^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the ambient mass density , @xmath142 the barion number density , @xmath143 the pulsar velocity , depends on the orbital phase .",
    "this should lead to periodic variations of the bow shock position with the period @xmath15d .",
    "the amplitude of these variations depends on the angle between the velocity @xmath144 of the binary system and the orbital plane . since this angle is unknown , and the pulsar s orbital velocity , @xmath145",
    "km s@xmath4 , is small compared to the velocity of the binary , @xmath146 , we neglect this effect in our estimates . ] , and @xmath147 is the angle between the pulsar velocity and the line of sight ( e.g. , ) . for the j0437 bow shock , @xmath148 cm ( @xmath2 in the image ) corresponds to @xmath149",
    "cm ( @xmath150@xmath151 in the image ) , in agreement with the observed bow shock thickness near apex . using the approximation by @xcite , @xmath152",
    ", we estimate the spin - down power as @xmath153ergs@xmath4 , and obtain an estimate for the ambient baryon density from equation ( 1 ) : @xmath154@xmath29 , in agreement with the @xmath155@xmath29 estimated from the h@xmath0 bow shock flux ( br14 ) .    from the analysis of the h@xmath0",
    "bow shock emission , br14 derived a high neutral h fraction , @xmath156 , in the preshock ambient medium , which implies a low degree of photoionization by uv and soft x - ray photons emitted from the pulsar , its pwn , and the shocked ism .",
    "if the pulsar were not moving , it would ionize the ambient medium up to distances much larger than @xmath137 ( within its strmgren sphere ) .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite ( see also and @xcite ) , the characteristic size @xmath157 of the photoionized region ahead of a _ moving _ source of ionizing radiation can be estimated as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the source ( pulsar ) velocity , @xmath160 ev is the hydrogen ionization potential , @xmath161 is the photon spectrum of ionizing radiation , @xmath162 is the photoionization cross section , @xmath163 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath164 is the bohr radius , and @xmath165 is the gaunt factor ( @xmath166 at @xmath167 ) . for j0437 ,",
    "the main source of ionizing radiation is thermal emission from the neutron star surface .",
    "we derive @xmath168 @xmath14 s@xmath4 for the j0437 spectrum , which is well fitted with superposition of three blackbody components @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath169 cm , two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath137 .",
    "thus , the preshock degree of ionization is essentially the same as in the unperturbed ism , thanks to the high pulsar speed .    from our observations we estimated the fuv",
    "bow shock luminosity @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , a factor of 10 higher than the h@xmath0 luminosity from the same ( small ) region of the bow shock .",
    "the shape of the fuv spectrum remains poorly constrained because the imaging observations were done with only two very broad filters with overlapping passbands , while the prism observation was not suited for spectroscopy of extended sources .",
    "our analysis has shown , however , that the limited data available are consistent with model spectra of shocked ism .",
    "the ism matter is compressed , heated , and partly ionized at the fs front . at a highly supersonic pulsar velocity",
    "the ions are heated up to @xmath170  k , where @xmath171 is the mean ion mass . behind the fs front",
    ", the ions energy is partly transferred to electrons and the flow speed decreases .",
    "therefore , at some postshock distance the plasma temperature and density become high enough to emit a complex uv - optical spectrum comprised of both continuum and line emission .    using the ` shells ` code for plane - parallel shocks",
    ", we found that the observed count rate ratio in two fuv filters and the ratio of the fuv and h@xmath0 fluxes are consistent with the model predictions at reasonable values of the preshock density and shock velocity ( section 3.3.1 ) , and the model spectrum is consistent with the observed prism spectrum at the same parameters ( section 3.3.2 ) .",
    "in addition to comparing the count rate and flux ratios ( see figure [ shells_fluxes ] ) , a comparison of the observed shock fluxes with the model fluxes allows us to estimate the emitting area of the plane shock needed to provide the observed flux .",
    "since the model flux is calculated per unit area of the plane shock , the emitting area can be estimated as @xmath172@xmath14 , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the observed and model fluxes in units of @xmath175 and @xmath121erg@xmath27s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the model flux in the 12502000  range is shown in the lower panel of figure [ shells_fluxes ] as a function of @xmath109 for three @xmath110 values .",
    "the flux weakly depends on @xmath109 , and it is approximately proportional to the upstream density , @xmath176 .",
    "the observed fuv flux , estimated with pysynphot for the calculated model spectra , weakly depends on the assumed model .",
    "its characteristic value is @xmath177 , and its uncertainty is mainly due to systematic errors . using this estimate",
    ", we obtain @xmath178 @xmath14 .",
    "this area corresponds to the radius @xmath179 cm ( angular radius of @xmath180 for @xmath108@xmath29 ) comparable with the fuv extraction region size perpendicular to the pulsar s proper motion direction .",
    "we should note , however , that the size of the downstream fuv emitting region in the plane shock model , @xmath181 a few @xmath182 cm for the plausible @xmath109 and @xmath110 values , considerably exceeds the thickness of the observed bow shock , @xmath183 cm , and even the stand - off distance of the bow shock apex , @xmath184 cm .",
    "this is not surprising because , contrary to the bow shock , the downstream region of the plane shock is not confined by the pulsar wind ram pressure , but it shows that applicability of plane shock models to bow shocks is limited .",
    "thus , to prove that the observed fuv structure is indeed emission from a shocked ism matter , the observational data should be compared to a realistic radiative bow shock model .    in some of our observations we detected an extended `` blob '' of @xmath43 ( 460au at @xmath185pc ) size at the bow shock limb ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "the lack of the blob in the wide - band optical / nuv images implies a spectrum that would be very unusual for a galaxy of any kind .",
    "the positional coincidence with the bow shock limb and the fact that the blob is also marginally detected in the acs / wfc image from 2013 suggest that the blob is likely associated with the bow shock ( e.g. , caused by an ism inhomogeneity or an instability in the fs region ) .    according to pwn models for supersonically moving pulsars ( e.g. , )",
    ", the emission from the shocked ism behind the fs should be accompanied by synchrotron emission from the shocked pulsar wind confined between the bullet - like termination shock ( ts ) surface and the cd surface .",
    "the synchrotron pwn is expected to have a cometary shape , with a `` head '' in front of the moving pulsar and a `` tail '' behind the pulsar .",
    "such head - tail pwn morphologies have been observed in x - rays from a number of ordinary and recycled pulsars ( see @xcite for examples ) .",
    "our analysis of archival x - ray observations of j0437 has shown an extended emission up to a distance of about @xmath6 ahead of the pulsar ( a factor of @xmath1811.5 smaller than the @xmath139 estimate ) but no tail behind .",
    "we presume that the detected emission represents a brighter part of the pwn head , possibly enhanced due to compression of the magnetic field , while the fainter emission from the rest of the pwn could be detected in deeper high - resolution x - ray observations .",
    "we should note that such a small head would not be resolved if j0437 were not so nearby .",
    "among other nearby pulsars , geminga ( @xmath186 pc ) and psr b105552 ( @xmath187 pc ) show hints of x - ray emission up to a few arcseconds ahead of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "however , geminga also shows three tails whose origin is unclear , while b105552 is likely moving away from us close to the line of sight , which leads to a different shape of the x - ray pwn image .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the detected extended emission , @xmath188 ergs@xmath4 , corresponds to the x - ray efficiency @xmath189 .",
    "such an efficiency is consistent with those of pwne of supersonically moving pulsars @xcite , which supports our interpretation of the extended x - ray emission .",
    "although the interpretation of the observed fuv emission as due to a collisionless shock in a partially ionized ism is consistent with the data available , we can not provide a direct proof of this interpretation until the emission spectrum ( including spectral lines ) is measured and compared with bow shock model predictions .",
    "therefore , there still remains a possibility that the fuv emission might be due to synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons leaked from the x - ray pwn region and trapped at the forward bow shock . to escape from the x - ray pwn and reach the bow shock ,",
    "the electron should have a sufficiently large gyroradius , @xmath190 cm for the x - ray emitting electrons , at ( and beyond ) the pwn s outer boundary ( cf .  ) .",
    "a fraction of the escaped electrons can be `` trapped '' in the bow shock vicinity via multiple scattering on quasi - resonant magnetic fluctuations created by the current - driven instability ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "protons with energies of up to @xmath1911 tev , required for developing of this instability , could be accelerated at the moving bow shock .",
    "this scenario may result in a specific spectrum of the high energy electrons trapped in the bow shock vicinity and producing the fuv synchrotron emission . not only their energies should be above some minimal energy to escape from the x - ray pwn and reach the bow shock , but they should also be limited at the high energy end by the confinement condition at the bow shock .",
    "if this maximal energy is close to that of fuv - emitting electrons , it could explain the lack of x - ray emission at the bow shock .",
    "a sharp drop in the fuv surface brightness toward the x - ray pwn , such as the one seen in our sbc images , could be due to a relatively low magnetic field in that region .",
    "of course , this qualitative scenario remains hypothetical until it is supported by quantitative models .    to definitively determine the nature of the discovered fuv bow shock of psrj0437@xmath14715 , its spatially resolved spectrum",
    "should be measured with a higher spectral resolution , in fuv as well as in nuv / optical wavelength ranges .",
    "we expect to see fuv shocks from other nearby pulsars , including those for which no h@xmath0 bow shocks were detected .",
    "observations of such fuv shocks , currently possible only with the _ hst _ , would be very useful for studying the ism properties , the interaction of pulsar winds with the ambient medium , and the mechanisms of particle acceleration .",
