    "the present paper gives a moderate contribution to the theory of asymptotic properties of mle for jump - type heston models based on continuous time observations .",
    "concerning related works , due to the vast literature on parameter estimation for heston models , we will restrict ourselves to mention only papers that investige the very same types of questions .",
    "for a detailed and recent survey on parameter estimation for heston models in general , see the introduction of barczy and pap @xcite .",
    "overbeck @xcite studied mle of the drift parameters of the first coordinate process of a ( diffusion type ) heston model ( see ) based on continuous time observations , which is nothing else but a cir process , also called square root process or feller process .",
    "ben - alaya and kebaier @xcite , @xcite made a progress in mle for the cir process , giving explicit forms of joint laplace transforms of the building blocks of this mle as well .",
    "barczy and pap @xcite considered a heston model @xmath5 where  @xmath6 ,  @xmath7 ,  @xmath8  and  @xmath9  is a 2-dimensional standard wiener process . here",
    "@xmath10  is the log - price process of an asset ,  @xmath11  is its stochastic volatility ( or instantaneous variance ) ,  @xmath12  is the so - called volatility of the volatility , and  @xmath8  is the correlation between the driving standard wiener processes  @xmath13  and  @xmath14 .",
    "mle of the drift parameters  @xmath15  and its asymptotic behavior have been investigated based on continuous time observations  @xmath16}$ ]  with  @xmath17  for all admissible parameter values",
    "( according to  @xmath18 ,  @xmath19 ,  and  @xmath20 ) .",
    "the original heston model ( see heston @xcite ) takes the form @xmath21 where  @xmath22  is the price process of an asset ,  @xmath23  is the rate of return of the asset ,  @xmath24  is the so - called long variance ( long run average price variance , i.e. , the limit of  @xmath25  as  @xmath26 ) ,  @xmath27  is the rate at which  @xmath11  reverts to  @xmath28 ,  and  @xmath29  is the so - called volatility of the volatility .",
    "we call the attention that there are two differences between the models and .",
    "namely , in the coefficient  @xmath30  can only be positive , while in the corresponding coefficient  @xmath31  can be an arbitrary real number .",
    "in other words , the first coordinate process in can be subcritical , critical or supercritical ( according to  @xmath18 ,  @xmath19 ,  and  @xmath20 ) , but in it can only be subcritical ( since  @xmath32 ) .  moreover , the second coordinate process in is the price process , while in it is the log - price process .    in this paper",
    "we study a jump - type heston model ( also called a stochastic volatility with jumps model , svj model ) @xmath33 where  @xmath34  is a purely non - gaussian lvy process independent of  @xmath9  with lvy  khintchine representation @xmath35}(z ) ) \\ , m({\\mathrm{d}}z)\\right\\ } ,    \\qquad u \\in { \\mathbb{r}},\\ ] ] where  @xmath36  and  @xmath37  is a lvy measure concentrating on  @xmath38  with  @xmath39 .",

    ", a natural question may occur concerning the model .",
    "namely , is the drift coefficient of the second sde in well - adjusted in the sense that the discounted price process forms a martingale under some suitable equivalent martingale measure ? we renounce to consider this question , we just note that one may have to choose the parameter  @xmath43  in an appropriate way to assure this property . in lamberton and lapeyre (",
    "* section 7 ) one can find a detailed discussion of the same type of question for a jump - type black - scholes model , where the jumps of the log - price process is modelled by a compound poisson process .",
    "they derived a necessary and sufficient condition for the drift coefficient of the underlying sde in terms of the discounting factor and the parameters of the compound poisson process in question in order that the discounted price process is a martingale , see @xcite . for a good survey on jump - type heston models , pricing and hedging in these models , see runggaldier @xcite .",
    "in fact , the model is quite popular in finance with the special choice of the lvy process  @xmath44  as a compound poisson process .",
    "namely , let @xmath45 where  @xmath46  is a poisson process with intensity 1 ,  @xmath47  is a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables having no atom at zero ( i.e. ,  @xmath48 ) ,  and being independent of  @xmath49  as well . we also suppose that  @xmath49 ,  @xmath47 ,  @xmath50  and  @xmath51  are independent .",
