    "high t@xmath0 superconductivity of the cuprates , it is generally agreed upon , emerges out of an unconventional normal state .",
    "the most remarkable signatures of its strange metal behavior are the pseudogap in the density of states and the associated to it remnant bogoliubov modes .",
    "both show up in a wide temperature regime above t@xmath0 in the single - particle excitations , observed in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "novel scanning tunneling microscopy are now able to measure the spatial distribution of quasi - particle excitations on the atomic length scale @xcite and find intrinsic textured electronic structures , ranging over a wide regime from low doped to optimally doped and beyond .",
    "the spatial patterns of the single - particle spectral properties indicate an inter - relation between the low frequency bogoliubov modes and their high frequency counterparts , representing localized glassy structures . in this work",
    "we show how this feature can be related to a scenario in which itinerant fermionic charge carriers scatter in and out of bosonic tightly bound pairs of them in which they are momentarily trapped on nano - size deformable molecular clusters .",
    "the single - particle excitations thus appear as superpositions of itinerant and localized entities .",

    "it is composed of ( i ) cu@xmath2o@xmath3 domains acting as localizing pairing centers with directionally oriented cu - o - cu molecular bonds , having central bridging o s ( grey circles ) which can be displaced out of the cuo@xmath1 plane and ( ii ) cu@xmath2o@xmath2 square plaquettes housing the delocalized charge carriers .",
    "small red circles denote cu cations and the larger blue ones the o anions not directly involved in displacements.,width=288 ]    ever since the discovery of the high t@xmath0 cuprates , experimental evidence for their very unusual lattice properties has become increasingly evident .",
    "apart from their well established strongly correlated nature , these compounds are metastable single phase materials @xcite .",
    "their metastability arises from frozen - in structural misfits , involving an incompatibility between the cu - o distances of square planar [ cu - o@xmath2 ] configurations in the cuo@xmath1 planes and of cation - ligand distances in the adjacent layers .",
    "metastable compounds have been known for a long time for their intrinsic local diamagnetic fluctuations @xcite , capable of inducing a strong pairing component in the many - body ground state wave function .",
    "the interest in synthesizing materials with such properties was to bypass the stringent conditions on the upper limit of t@xmath0 , imposed by phonon mediated bcs superconductivity @xcite .    on a microscopic level",
    ", the metastability in the cuprates arises from fluctuating [ cu - o - cu ] molecular bonds in the cuo@xmath1 planes @xcite .",
    "their deformable ligand environments @xcite act as potential pairing centers @xcite induced in the undoped systems upon hole doping .",
    "these nano size domains exhibit an atomic structure @xcite , which locally breaks translational as well as rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "two degenerate spatially orthogonally oriented [ cu - o - cu ] bonds cause the cuo@xmath1 plane structure to segregate into a patchwork of orientationally disordered domains , separated by a lattice of essentially undeformable molecular clusters .",
    "ultimately , this forms an effective bipartite lattice structure @xcite of the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "the charge transfer between the pairing centers and the molecular clusters on the lattice surrounding them leads to resonant pairing on that latter .",
    "it is controlled by an interplay between localization of the charge carriers in form of bound pairs on the pairing centers and their delocalization on the lattice which spatially separates them . on a macroscopic level",
    ", those materials exhibit an overall homogeneous crystal structure in a coarse grained sense @xcite .",
    "but occasionally , such as in la@xmath5ba@xmath6cuo@xmath2 for x=1/8 , the local lattice deformations of the pairing centers lock together in a charge ordered phase and thereby impeach superconductivity to occur@xcite .",
    "the `` formal chemical '' cu valence - not to be confused with its ionic charge - in the d - hole doped cuo@xmath1 planes lies between cu@xmath7 and cu@xmath8 . for an isolated undoped cuo@xmath1 plane",
    "this would correspond to stereochemical [ cu@xmath7-o ] distances of 1.94 @xmath9 in the [ cu - o@xmath2 ] basic blocks .",
    "the misfits between the atomic structure of the cuo@xmath1 planes and those of the adjacent layers , which furnish the dopant holes , push the bridging oxygen of the [ cu - o - cu ] bonds out of the cuo@xmath1 plane , making them buckled . by doing so",
    ", they can accommodate the stereochemically assigned inter - atomic distance of those bonds .",
    "the scenario for the doped cuprates , which we want to advocate in this work , is that the static displacements of the bridging oxygens , which characterize the undoped and low doped insulating phase , become dynamic .",
    "the fluctuation of the bridging oxygens of the [ cu - o - cu ] bonds , in and out of the planes , tends to diminish the plane buckling which characterizes the undoped material .",
    "this tendency gets more and more pronounced as the doping is increased , driven by the increased covalency of the cuo@xmath1 basal plane building blocks .",
    "it however shows a marked slowing down of this behavior as one passes through optimal doping@xcite . on a microscopic level",
    ", this implies fluctuations between kinked [ cu@xmath7 - o - cu@xmath7 ] molecular bonds ( characteristic for the undoped systems ) and straightened out ones [ cu@xmath8 - o - cu@xmath8 ] , with an ideal stereochemical [ cu@xmath8-o ] distances of 1.84 @xmath9 . in this process",
    "two electrons get momentarily captured in the local dynamically deformable structure of the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "it results in locally correlated charge - deformation fluctuations which break up the over - all homogeneous structure of the cuprates into a checker - board structure , as scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) results ( figs . 4 and 5 in ref .",
    "6 ) have shown . the net difference in length between the two different molecular bonds on such charge - deformation fluctuating checker - board pairing domains can be reduced ( i ) because of the dynamical nature of these pairing fluctuations and ( ii ) because it involves cooperatively several of such [ cu - o - cu ] bonds .",
    "the likelihood of a segregation of a homogeneous lattice structure into polaronic domains , embedded in a non - polaronic matrix , such as advocated in the present scenario , had been speculated upon for a long time . for the case of intermediate electron - lattice coupling and the adiabatic to anti - adiabatic cross - over regime ,",
    "individual itinerant charge carriers are known to fluctuate in and out of localized polaronic states @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the present state of art of the theory of many - polaronic systems can still not handle situations other than for homogeneous or globally symmetry broken solutions .",
    "nevertheless indications for resonant pairing in such systems exist , where the single - particle spectral function has both coherent delocalized contributions and localized ones in form of localized polarons , respectively bipolarons .",
    "this has been discussed in the framework of dynamical mean field theory , numerical renormalization group and monte carlo studies @xcite .",
    "given the complexity of the inter - related charge - deformation dynamics in such systems , it appeared judicious to introduce a phenomenological boson - fermion model ( bfm ) , to capture the salient features of such intrinsically locally dynamically unstable systems with a tendency to segregate into subsystems of localized and itinerant charge carriers .",
    "this idea was originally proposed by one of us ( jr ) in the early eighties in an attempt to describe the abrupt cross - over between a weak coupling adiabatic electron - phonon mediated bcs superconductor and an insulating state , respectively superconducting phase , of bipolarons in the strong coupling anti - adiabatic regime .",
    "the essential features of this conjectured bfm was to introduce an effective local boson - fermion exchange coupling between polaronically bound pairs and itinerant charge carriers .",
    "this picture has been substantiated subsequently by small cluster calculations for electrons strongly coupled to localized lattice vibrational modes @xcite .",
    "it permits to relate the effective boson - fermion exchange coupling back to the parameters , characterizing the electron - lattice coupled system , ie . , local phonon frequency and electron - phonon coupling .    in order to cast into a tractable model the physics of dynamically fluctuating [ cu - o - cu ] bonds , which trigger local double charge fluctuations , we present in fig . 1 an idealized structure for such a local checker - board bipartite lattice structure , which comes very close to the actually observed structure .",
    "the corresponding checker - board pairing centers consist of cu@xmath2o@xmath3 domains ( three nearest neighbor cu - cu distances across ) on which charge carriers pair up , driven by polaronic effects .",
    "the lattice deformations of adjacent cu@xmath2o@xmath3 domains are assumed to be uncorrelated in order to prevent the system to undergo a global lattice instability .",
    "the orientational randomness of the [ cu - o - cu ] unidirectional bonds , together with the quadratic cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquettes ( see fig.1 ) , which separate those polaronic cu@xmath2o@xmath3 domains , justifies that . ultimately , this results in the picture of an overall bipartite lattice structure for the cuo@xmath1 planes with a periodicity of four nearest neighbor cu - cu distances .",
    "d - holes on the non - polaronic cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquettes in the cuprates are known to behave as delocalized , though strongly correlated , entities subject to d@xmath12 - wave pairing correlations @xcite . in the present study",
    "we shall concentrate on the purely lattice driven pairing aspects in the cuprates , caused by their intrinsic metastabilities .",
    "we hence neglect here any hubbard type correlations leading to hole pairing and treat the cu@xmath2o@xmath2 square plaquettes as effective lattice sites on which the charge carriers behave as itinerant uncorrelated quasi - particles .",
    "when they hop on and off the cu@xmath2o@xmath3 pairing centers , they interact with their local dynamical deformations .",
    "the resulting local physics for resonant pairing for such a set - up and its manifestations in the electronic and phononic spectral properties have been studied in some detail by exact diagonalization studies @xcite .",
    "indications for resonant pairing in the cuprates , driven by local dynamical lattice fluctuations can be found in quite a variety of experimental studies : the longitudinal optical ( lo ) cu - o bond stretching mode of about 60 mev appears strongly coupled to charge carriers near the _ hotspot _ anti - nodal points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) @xmath13= [ \\pm \\pi/2,0],[0 , \\pm \\pi/2]$ ] @xcite .",
    "their pairing results in the pseudogap feature , setting in when reducing the temperature t to below a certain , strongly doping dependent , t@xmath14 . upon entering the superconducting doping regime , coming from the insulating parent compound ,",
    "this lo mode splits into two modes , separated by @xmath15 10 mev @xcite .",
    "this indicates a crystal lattice symmetry breaking , linked to dynamical charge inhomogeneities which are absent in the underdoped and overdoped insulating phases .",
    "pressure @xcite , isotope substitution studies @xcite and atomic resolution @xmath16-spectroscopy @xcite show concomitant anticorrelated modulations of the pseudo - gap size and the frequency of this lo buckling mode .",
    "correlated charge - deformation fluctuations , related to a resonant pairing superconducting phase show up in the onset of a macroscopic superfluid state of the charge carriers together with changes in the local lattice dynamics which acquires phase correlated macroscopic features .",
    "they are seen in rutherford back scattering experiments @xcite , an abrupt decrease in the kinetic energy of local vibrational modes @xcite , a similar abrupt increase of a low energy electronic background , seen in near ir excited raman scattering @xcite and an increase in intensity of certain raman active phonon modes @xcite , indicative of changes in the scattering mechanism involving the charge carriers and local lattice modes .",
    "superconductivity in the cuprates is destroyed , exclusively , by phase fluctuations of a bosonic order parameter @xcite , with the finite amplitude of it , being already established well above t@xmath0 .",
    "it reflects the local nature of the cooper - pairs , whose signature is ( i ) a @xmath17 scaling with the zero temperature density of superfluid carriers @xcite and ( ii ) the xy character of the transition @xcite . going into the normal state , above t@xmath0 , the propagating cooperons become diffusive and the superconducting gap changes into a pseudogap in a continuous fashion @xcite .",
    "the observed nernst @xcite , transient meissner effect @xcite and the proximity induced pseudogap @xcite bare this out .",
    "the gap in the single - particle spectrum and the diffusively propagating strongly bound cooper pairs testify the competition between amplitude and phase fluctuations of the order parameter in form of an anti - correlated t@xmath0 versus t@xmath14 variation upon changing the hole doping @xcite .",
    "the insulating , not antiferromagnetically ordered glassy state , at low temperature and low doping can be envisaged as a mott correlation driven state of phase uncorrelated singlet-_bonding pairs_. with increased doping , this insulating state changes into a superconducting phase correlated state of such _ bonding pairs _",
    "_ bonding pairs _ are defined by local linear superpositions of bound pairs and pairs of itinerant charge carriers . to what extent such an insulating state could result from a cooper - pair wigner crystallization ,",
    "has been investigated @xcite .",
    "the features which characterize the normal and superconducting phase of the cuprates necessitate to treat amplitude and phase fluctuations on an equal footing .",
    "this had originally also been the objective in conjecturing the bfm and to project out coexisting effective bosonic and fermionic charge excitations for systems which are at the frontier between amplitude fluctuation driven bcs superconductors and a phase fluctuation driven superfuidity of tightly bound real - space pairs .",
    "the bfm is designed to treat a system , where at any given moment a certain percentage of the charge carriers is locally paired and thus results in a finite bosonic amplitude .",
    "this is achieved by imposing a common chemical potential ( determined by the bosonic energy level ) for the fermionic and bosonic charge carriers . a charge exchange term , linking the fermionic and bosonic subsystem",
    ", then controls the inter - related dynamics between amplitude and phase fluctuations .",
    "it drives the system either to an insulating or superfluid state with corresponding superconducting , respectively insulating , gaps being centered at the chemical potential .",
    "the opening of such gaps does not depend on any particular set of fermi wavevectors and hence is unrelated to any global translational symmetry breaking .",
    "the degree of anisotropy of pairing and of the charge carrier dispersion in the cuo@xmath1 planes monitors the relative importance of localization versus delocalization in different regions of the brillouin zone . near the anti - nodal points , strong pairing results from strong intra-_bonding pair _ correlations between bound pairs on the pairing centers and their itinerant counterparts in their immediate vicinity @xcite .",
    "it leads to their partial localization , which shows up in form of a pseudogap in the single - particle spectral properties and destroys the fermi surface .",
    "as one moves toward the nodal points , @xmath18 = [ \\pm \\pi/2,\\pm \\pi/2]$ ] , along the socalled fermi arc in the brillouin zone ( corresponding to the fermi surface in the non - interacting system ) , those intra-_bonding pair _ phase correlations are weakened .",
    "the degree of localization then reduces and with it , the size of the pseudogap . at the same time , inter-_bonding pair _ phase correlations between neighboring pairing domains come into play and with it , superconducting phase locking . at low energies , this leads to bogoliubov like modes , which emerge out of localized phase uncorrelated _ bonding pairs_. we derive below these properties on the basis of the bfm , adapted to the specific anisotropic features of the cuprates .",
    "transposing our picture of the cuprate molecular structure ( fig .",
    "1 ) onto the bfm ( see also figs . 3 and 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) implies the following : we introduce effective lattice sites , which are composed of two components : one which represents the pairing centers ( the cu@xmath2o@xmath3 domains ) and describes selftrapped bosonic pairs of charge carriers .",
    "the other one which describes the itinerant charge carriers on the four - site ring , constituted of the cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquettes , taking into account that each such plaquette is shared by four neighboring pairing centers .",
    "for the undoped half - filled band situation , with one electron per cu site , we thus have four itinerant electrons on the ring , belonging to a specific pairing center and four electrons being localized in form of two cu@xmath7-o - cu@xmath7 bonds on the pairing centers .",
    "deviating from the undoped limit upon doping n@xmath19 holes per cu ion into the systems , reduces the concentration of cu@xmath7-o - cu@xmath7 bonds in the trapping centers by n@xmath20 @xmath15 @xmath21 n@xmath19 .",
    "this opens up the phase space for itinerant electrons from the four - site ring to hop on off those trapping centers .",
    "such a resonant scattering process converts a small number n@xmath20 of those itinerant charge carriers into bosonic bound pairs .",
    "following the experimental results of the strong changes in local lattice properties with hole doping , we assume that hole doping monitors exclusively the concentration of the cu@xmath7-o - cu@xmath7 bonds and that hence the total number of itinerant electrons and induced pairs of them will remain roughly the same as it was in the undoped case , i.e. , n@xmath22 = n@xmath23 + 2n@xmath20 = 1 .",
    "the d - wave paring symmetry of those systems imposes an analogous d - wave symmetry for the exchange interaction between ( i ) pairs of itinerant charge carriers @xmath24 , corresponding to the `` plaquette site '' states and ( ii ) polaronicaly bound pairs of them @xmath25 , corresponding to the `` pairing center site '' states .",
    "the hamiltonian describing such a scenario is then given by @xmath26 the anisotropy , which characterizes the electronic structure of cuprates , is contained in the standard expression for the bare charge carrier dispersion given by @xmath27 + 4t'cos k_x cos k_y$ ] of the cuo@xmath1 planes with @xmath28 and the bare d - wave exchange coupling @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "given the polaronic origin of the localized pairs of tightly bound charge carriers , we assume them as dispersionless bosonic excitations with @xmath30 .",
    "the charge exchange term @xmath31 controls the transfer of electrons ( holes ) between real and momentum space @xcite and monitors the interplay between the delocalizing and the localizing effect . depending on the strength of the exchange coupling @xmath32",
    ", it results in a competition between local intra-_bonding pair _ correlations , favoring insulating features , and spatial inter-_bonding pair _ correlations , favoring superconducting phase locking @xcite .",
    "the fermionic particles thereby acquire contributions coming from the bosonic particles and the bosonic particles having features derived from their fermionic constituents . as we shall see below , the physically meaningful fermions in such a system are superpositions of fermions and bosonic bound fermion pairs , accompanied by fermion holes . this boson - fermion duality , which characterizes the electronic state of the cuprates , results from the `` duplicituous''@xcite nature of their charge carriers , which supports simultaneously superconducting correlations in momentum space ( fermionic bogoliubov excitations ) and real space correlations resulting in the pseudogap ( derived from localized bosonic bound fermion pairs ) .",
    "this apparent `` schizophrenic '' behavior @xcite of the quasi - particles can be traced back to their different energy scales characterizing their excitations .",
    "large excitation energies ( above the fermi energy ) characterize their localized selftrapped nature and small excitation energies ( below the fermi energy ) their quasi - coherently propagating cooper pair nature .    in order to obtain the spectroscopic features of effective fermionic and bosonic excitations we have to reformulate this interacting boson - fermion mixture in terms of two effective commuting hamiltonians , one describing purely fermionic excitations and one purely bosonic ones .",
    "the boson - fermion interaction thereby is absorbed into inter - dependent coupling constants by renormalizing @xmath32 down to zero via a flow - equation renormalization approach @xcite . at every step of this procedure the renormalized hamiltonian",
    "is projected onto the basic structure given by @xmath33 plus a renormalization generated fermion - fermion interactions term@xcite @xmath34 this is achieved by transforming the hamiltonian in infinitesimal steps , controlled by a flow parameter @xmath35 in tems of repeated unitary transformations @xmath36 , resulting in differential equations @xmath37 $ ] with @xmath38 , determining the flow of the parameters of our system . in its canonical form @xcite ,",

    "both have since been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of the electronic structure of cuprates tracks a change - over from self - trapped ( localized ) fermions , in form of diffusively propagating bosonic pairs , into itinerant propagating ( delocalized ) fermions upon going from the anti - nodal to the nodal point on an arc in the brillouin zone , determined by @xmath49 . to illustrate that",

    "our choice of the boson - fermion exchange coupling strength g = 0.1 , yields a typical onset temperature t@xmath56 for the pseudogap of roughly a hundred degrees k. for a characteristic temperature of the pseudogap phase ( @xmath57 ) , it implies a concentration of itinerant fermionic charge carriers @xmath58 and that of self - trapped ones bound into fermion pairs , @xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to a hole doping @xmath60 , with a total number of carriers of @xmath61 .",
    "hole doping redistributes the relative occupation of fermions and bosons which ultimately leads to a shrinking of the arcs ( see section v ) .",
    "the charge carriers around the nodal point are primarily given by delocalized fermionic one - particle states , while at the hotspot anti - nodal points they are localized bosonic bound fermion pairs . yet , as we shall see below , they will become itinerant and eventually condense as the temperature is decreased .",
    "the reason for that is that the bare exchange coupling @xmath32 is equal to zero at the nodal point ( @xmath62 ) and increases as one moves to the anti - nodal points ( @xmath63 ) , where it reaches its maximal value , equal to g. as a consequence , @xmath64 remains essentially unrenormalized for @xmath53 vectors crossing the arc near the nodal point . upon approaching the anti - nodal point , on the contrary , @xmath64 acquires a sharp s - like inflexion at @xmath51 , which leads to the the appearance of the pseudogap in the single - particle density of states .",

    "4 for t=0.007 , which sample the anisotropy of the cuo@xmath1 electronic structure , where @xmath110 indicates the azimuthal angle in this plane .",
    "notice that along the nodal direction the number of bosons is independent on @xmath115 , because of the absence of any boson - fermion coupling . as one approaches the direction linking the center of the zone with the anti - nodal points , the exchange coupling steadily increases and",
    "consequently the intrinsically localized bosons acquire itinerancy and gather in a region of long wavelength .",
    "those bosons have internal structure of two fermions with opposite momenta centered around @xmath51 . in the inset of fig .",
    "4 we illustrate the total number of such bosons along the various @xmath114 vectors and notice the relative increase , respectively decrease compared to their average value @xmath116 , depending on whether we are sampling the nodal or the anti - nodal directions .",
    "the accumulation of fermions getting converted into fermion pairs in certain parts of the brillouin zone , close the anti - nodal points , has its counter part in the diminishing density of single - particle fermionic excitations in the same regions .",
    "we illustrate that in fig . 5 , where we plot the variation of the coherent part of the single - particle dispersion , given by @xmath64 around @xmath51 .",
    "we notice that with diminishing @xmath52 , approaching the anti - nodal points , the corresponding value of @xmath51 diminishes .",
    "this announces a shrinking of the fermi sea , causing an emptying out of single - particle states and consequently an increase of bound fermion pairs .",
    "this feature had previously been observed in connection with the transition between the superconducting state of phase correlated bonding pairs and the insulating state of such phase uncorrelated bonding pairs @xcite .",
    "our scenario for the cuprate superconductivity is based on resonant pairing , induced by local dynamical lattice instabilities upon hole doping .",
    "it makes use of the fact that such systems are prone to a segregation of globally homogeneous crystal structures into small nano - size pairing domains .",
    "this breaks locally the translational as well as rotational symmetry by randomly orienting uni - directional cu - o - cu molecular bonds in different directions . as a result ,",
    "the fermionic charge carriers acquire single - particle spectral features which comprise simultaneously : ( i ) quasi localized states , where they are momentarily trapped in form of bound pairs in polaronic charge fluctuating local domains and ( ii ) delocalized states on a sublattice in which those polaronic domains are embedded .",
    "due to the d - wave pairing , which in our case is encoded in the anisotropic boson - fermion exchange coupling @xmath32 , the spectral properties of the single - particle excitations exhibit a pseudogap with the following features : as we move on a constant energy line in the brillouin zone , corresponding to the chemical potential ( where such an arc determines the fermi surface , whenever it exists ) , @xmath117 diminishes as we go from the anti - nodal ( @xmath118 ) to the nodal region ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "concomitantly the size of the pseudogap , @xmath120 , decreases . for @xmath121 , with @xmath122 for our choice of parameters , it remains relatively unaffected by changes in temperature t. on the contrary , for @xmath123 , @xmath120 becomes strongly t dependent . for low t",
    ", it tends to zero gradually as one approaches @xmath62 . with increasing t",
    ", it tends to zero at increasingly larger values of @xmath52 , ( see fig.3 ) , as observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "this suggest that :    \\(i ) the pseudogap in a finite region ( @xmath124 ) around the anti - nodal point is controlled by predominately local pairing ( via intra-_bonding - pair _ correlations ) , which is independent on doping and largely unaffected by superconducting phase fluctuations .",
    "\\(ii ) the pseudogap in a finite region ( @xmath123 ) around the nodal point is controlled by both , local intra-_bonding - pair _ as well as non - local superconducting inter-_bonding - pair _ correlations , which are sensitive to phase fluctuations and cause the dependence of @xmath120 on t as well as on doping .    the diffusively propagating low energy bogoliubov like excitations around @xmath90 , which trace out the pseudogap , are a hallmark of the single - particle spectral features of such resonant pairing systems and which exist even near the anti - nodal points .",
    "in contrast to a bcs scenario , here , their appearence above t@xmath0 does not require a phase coherence of the bosonic bound fermion pairs .",
    "such bogoliubov like modes nucleate from local intra-_bonding - pair _ correlations between pairs of itinerant fermions and localized fermion pairs @xcite on local molecular clusters , such as discussed here .",
    "they are a signature of a prevailing glassy bose metallic behavior prone to transit into a superconducting state of phase correlated such bosonic intra-_bonding - pairs_. the momentum dependence of those two - particle excitations , shows a strong tendency toward condensation ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which tracks the anisotropic behavior of the gap . provided the boson - fermion exchange coupling is not too big , such bosonic pairs forming near the anti - nodal points , will dominate the superconductivity , against a widespread opinion that they should be localized there . for sufficiently large g , they of course will be localized .",
    "this is a topic which will require further investigations , dealing with the superconductor to insulator ( bose glass ) transition with reduced hole doping .",
    "the internal structure of those diffusively propagating cooperons , consisting of selftrapped fermions , is manifest in their single - particle excitations above the chemical potential .",
    "it reflects their atomic localized nature , where two - particle localized bonding and anti - bonding satellites trail the dispersion of their delocalized coherent contributions @xcite .",
    "the low energy diffusive collective bogoliubov excitations and the high energy single - particle excitations are two different manifestations of the same entity .",
    "whether there is a sharp border line for the onset of the high energy localized features in the brillouin zone , as suggested by a socalled doping independent `` extinction line '' @xcite , will have to be checked in future for the present scenario .",
    "let us conclude this study with some remarks on the kind of doping mechanism we can envisage in the cuprate high t@xmath0 compounds . for low hole doping it can be understood in terms of a doped mott insulator and an antiferromagnetic ground state , transiting into a spin singlet liquid glassy state with increased doping .",
    "for the remaining doping regime , approaching the optimal and overdoped regions , it remains largely an open problem to be resolved .",
    "experimentally one finds a singular universal optimal doping rate n@xmath125 holes / cu atom , where t@xmath0 reaches its maximum together with a maximal volume fraction of the meissner effect and a hall number becoming sharply peaked @xcite . in scenarios , like the present one , based on inter - related amplitude and phase fluctuations , optimal doping also characterizes the region where the energies of the superconducting phase stiffness and that of the pairing coincide @xcite .",
    "these doping dependent electronic features are accompanied by a reduction of the buckling of the cuo@xmath1 planes @xcite , which characterizes the low doped insulating phase .",
    "pressure tuned electronic transitions , testing electronic and lattice features at the same time @xcite , point to a critical pressure which can be identified with the critical doping rate n@xmath126 .",
    "the universal value of @xmath127=0.16 , occures for any optimally doped system , whatever the chemical structure of the doping blocks might be .",
    "this suggests that , upon approaching optimal doping , the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom must get strongly locked together @xcite and by doing so increase the stability of these intrinsically metastable materials . and indeed , upon trying to force extra holes into such systems by overdoping @xmath128 , they segregate into different crystalline phases @xcite , with superconducting components composed of underdoped and optimally doped regions .",
    "understanding the doping dependence of the cuprates thus becomes tantamount to understanding the structural stability of those system .",
    "it necessarily must involve correlated macroscopic features @xcite of charge and lattice deformations , such that precisely at optimal doping they optimally and constructively interfere with each other .",
    "transposing these experimental facts on the scenario discussed in this paper , the fluctuating local domains in the cuo@xmath1 planes get increasingly coherently locked together as hole doping increases .",
    "this results in a decrease of spatial phase fluctuations of the bosonic resonantly bound fermion pairs driven by locally fluctuating lattice structures , while at the same time their conjugate amplitude fluctuations increase . as a consequence t@xmath0 increases and t@xmath14 decreases .",
    "previous studies @xcite on the interplay between amplitude and phase fluctuations bare that out .    according to the presently available experimental facts ( ref .",
    "13,34,35,53 - 55 ) , the chemical doping mechanism , which imposes itself in the cuprates ( following our scenario ) , converts part of the itinerant electrons into polaronically driven resonating pairs , predominantly in certain regions of the brillouin zone ( see fig .",
    "4 ) near the anti - nodal points . it manifests itself in the opening of a pseudogap , which nucleates at the socalled hot - spots , where the local boson - fermion exchange coupling g is maximal .",
    "the self - regulating redistribution of itinerant charge carriers and bosonic bound pairs of them on the arcs in the brillouin zone , is an intrinsic rather than an extrinsic @xcite feature of the scenario presented here .",
    "it originates from strong electron - lattice coupling , in a system with a highly anisotropic electronic dispersion and coupling to local lattice modes , evidenced in the anisotropic isotope dependent pseudogap and responsible for the local symmetry breaking of those systems .",
    "given this experimental situation , we conjecture that hole doping primarily will replace the buckled cu@xmath7-o - cu@xmath7 bonds by unbuckled cu@xmath8-o - cu@xmath8 ones , whose density n@xmath20 will be roughly given by @xmath21n@xmath19 , n@xmath19 denoting the concentration of chemically doped holes .",
    "doping a single hole into the basic cluster of our segregated cuo@xmath1 planes means a doping rate of 1/8= 0.125 per cu ion .",
    "this is very close to the critical doping rate , which changes the insulating glassy phase into the superconducting one . doping a hole into the trapping centers breaks a cu@xmath7-o - cu@xmath7 bond .",
    "since this is not compatible with the basic square planar cuo@xmath2 structure in the cuo@xmath1 planes , doping will trigger a charge transfer between the trapping centers and the surrounding four - site rings , either by transferring an electron from the ring to the trapping center and re - establish the stable square planar cu@xmath7-o - cu@xmath7 bond , or by transferring an electron from that hole doped bond into the ring and leave behind a stable square planar cu@xmath8-o - cu@xmath8 bond .",
    "both of these processes act together to ensure the overall crystalline stability in systems with intrinsic local dynamically correlated charge - lattice fluctuations and thus result in resonant pairing of the itinerant electrons on the ring .",
    "the end - effect of this is a transfer of a fraction n@xmath129 of the electrons on the ring into the pairing centers , where they form pairs on a finite time scale with a concentration n@xmath20 = @xmath21n@xmath129 .",
    "this simultaneously implies a shrinking of the fermi surface .",
    "n@xmath22 = n@xmath23 + 2n@xmath20 in this doping procedure remains unaltered i.e. , equal to unity as it is in the undoped case .",
    "the effect of hole doping is hence to change the relative concentration of itinerant electrons with respect to the concentration of partly bound pairs of them .",
    "a multitude of different experimental results discussed here have been shown to be compatible with the resonant pairing scenario . qualitatively different from any bcs pairing scenario , here",
    "the itinerant delocalized bogoliubov excitations coexist with localized single - particle ones which are selftrapped inside of them .",
    "concerning the origin of this resonant pairing in the cuprates , which could be electronic @xcite , as well as polaronic , the recently observed breakdown of their homogeneous crystal structures into translational / rotational symmetry broken local clusters @xcite , gives us confidence that dynamical lattice deformations should play a determinant role in the superconducting state of high t@xmath0 compounds .",
