    "sdssj092712.65 + 294344.0 ( henceforward in this paper `` sdssj0927 '' ) is an object whose spectrum was acquired by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) as part of its quasar sample .",
    "it was first given special attention by @xcite , who combed the sdss quasar database for objects in which there was a substantial velocity offset between the [ oiii]5007 line and the other emission lines .",
    "in this case , there is [ oiii]5007 emission at the redshift of the broad line centroid ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "hereafter we will refer to this as the associated system .",
    "there is a second [ oiii]5007 line shifted 2650  km  s@xmath0   to the red , at @xmath2 ( hereafter the redshifted system ) .",
    "in fact , there are entire sets of narrow emission lines ( [ oiii]5007 , h@xmath3 , [ neiii]3869 , [ oii]3727 , [ nev]3426 ) at both redshifts , while broad lines ( h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , mgii2800 ) are present only in the lower redshift associated system . moreover , the narrow lines in the associated system all have substantially broader profiles ( fwhm @xmath52000  km  s@xmath0 ) than do those in the redshifted system ( fwhm @xmath6  km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "no stellar lines can be detected in the sdss spectrum , so there is as yet no measure of the redshift of the host galaxy . for reference",
    ", the sdss spectrum is shown in figure  1 with the key lines from both systems marked .    ; lower , blue vertical ticks ) and redshifted system ( @xmath2 ; upper , red ticks ) marked . from high to low wavelength , broad h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath7 , and mgii can also be seen . ]",
    "recent numerical relativity calculations have shown that it is possible for a black hole merger to be sufficiently asymmetric that the new merged system moves relative to the original center of mass by as much as several thousand km / s when the spins of the original pair are properly aligned relative to the orbital angular momentum and each other @xcite . on this basis , @xcite suggested that this is an example of exactly such an event : the redshifted narrow emission lines indicate the rest - frame of the host galaxy , while the associated emission lines , both broad and narrow , are attached to the black hole of the ejected quasar , which is moving through the host with a velocity along our line - of - sight of 2650  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this suggestion was criticized by @xcite and @xcite , who both argued that the data were more plausibly explained as arising from a black hole binary of separation @xmath80.3  pc and mass ratio @xmath90.3 . in this picture ,",
    "both black holes are surrounded by a circumbinary disk whose inner edge is a few times the orbital separation .",
    "the less massive black hole captures the majority of any gas travelling inward from the inner edge of the disk ; accretion of this gas powers the quasar .",
    "thus , the associated system would be attached to the lower - mass black hole , while the redshifted system would be affiliated with the more massive black hole .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite argue that this model is much more probable than the merger - recoil model .",
    "however , @xcite estimate that the rate of production of such systems should be @xmath10  yr@xmath0 within @xmath11 , while @xcite argue that such a recoiling quasar would stay within the galaxy for @xmath12  yr ; in other words , there should be @xmath13 at any given time within @xmath11 . on the other hand , there is no guarantee that the merger product would carry enough accretion fuel to last for @xmath14  yr . in addition , it seems somewhat implausible that a recoiling black hole would create a narrow emission line system centered on its velocity .",
    "the gas emitting these lines would need to have had initial binding energy to the pre - merger black hole within @xmath15 of the critical binding energy at which matter stays bound to the merged black hole . here",
    "@xmath16 is the characteristic speed of the gas relative to the merger remnant and @xmath17 is the recoil speed .",
    "serious difficulties also exist for the binary model .",
    "the problem we find most disturbing is the tight kinematic relation between the broad emission line system and its associated narrow lines . in this model ,",
    "the broad lines are made in more or less conventional fashion , even though the second , more massive black hole , is close enough that its gravity must influence the broad line gas  after all , its gravity is strong enough to force an orbital speed for the quasar black hole @xmath18  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the associated narrow lines are attributed to gas flowing between the circumbinary disk and the lower - mass black hole , and therefore traverse a region where , by construction , the characteristic orbital speed is @xmath19  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "it is hard to understand how , under these circumstances , the narrow lines could be centered on the velocity of the broad lines and have fwhms as small as 450  km  s@xmath0 . in addition , @xcite estimated that the density of the associated narrow emission line gas , if it occupies a thin disk filling the area within the edge of the circumbinary disk , is @xmath208@xmath21  @xmath22 . because it could be clumpy ,",
    "this is only a lower bound ( in fact , @xcite suggest that this gas could be the narrow accretion stream linking the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and the accretion disk of the smaller black hole ; if so , there would perforce be very strong clumping ) .",
    "however , at densities this high , the [ oiii]5007 line is at least partially suppressed by collisional de - excitation , and the [ oii]3727 line , whose critical density is @xmath23  @xmath22 , is even more so .    in view of these issues , we propose an entirely different model for this system , which we believe fits the existing data well and is intrinsically more plausible : that this system is a high - redshift analog to the familiar nearby seyfert galaxy ngc  1275 .",
    "this galaxy ( also known as 3c  84 and perseus  a ) is located at the center of the perseus cluster of galaxies .",
    "its optical emission line spectrum , judged by the standard of anything other than sdssj0927 , is most peculiar : it has two distinct narrow emission line systems , one close to the redshift of the galaxy , the other 3000  km  s@xmath0   to the red @xcite .",
    "emission line imaging has shown that the redshifted system is displaced from the center of the galaxy by 1020  kpc @xcite , while 21  cm and x - ray absorption at the higher redshift demonstrates that this gas lies between us and the nucleus of ngc  1275 @xcite . although argument raged for decades over whether the redshifted system is part of a small galaxy interacting with ngc  1275 ( as originally proposed by @xcite ) or is a member of the perseus cluster that is merely superposed on ngc  1275 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the weight of the evidence now rests on the side of interaction @xcite . to acquire its velocity ,",
    "the smaller galaxy presumably has fallen from the outskirts of the perseus cluster on a nearly radial orbit ; given the cluster dispersion of 1300  km  s@xmath0@xcite , such a supposition is quantitatively reasonable .",
    "almost all of these properties are duplicated in sdssj0927 .",
    "indeed , the only difference is that the nucleus of ngc 1275 is a moderately luminous type 2 seyfert , while sdssj0927 contains a powerful quasar . moreover ,",
    "all the difficulties of the models proposed earlier ( either the high - speed recoil or the binary black hole model ) disappear viewed from this perspective : there is no problem with probabilities  we already know of another example in the nearby universe .",
    "there is no problem with keeping the gas of the higher redshift system within a narrow range of velocities  it is confined within a galaxy while it travels through a region ( the cluster now , not the vicinity of a binary black hole ) with much higher orbital speeds .",
    "in addition , as we will show shortly , the directly derived properties of the emission - line gas are compatible with this model .",
    "the flux ratios of the associated narrow lines are very similar to those commonly found in agn . according to @xcite , the lines h@xmath3 , [ oii]3727",
    ", [ oiii]5007 , [ neiii]3869 , and [ nev]3426 have the relative strengths 1.0 , 1.5 , 6.7 , 1.8 , and 4.0 ( table  1 ) , while in the `` mean '' narrow line system in a seyfert or quasar , they would be 1.0 , 3.2 , 5.0,1.4 , and 1.2 @xcite .",
    "the greatest contrast is in the [ nev]3426 line .",
    "we might therefore suppose that the physical conditions in this gas ( ionization parameter , density , etc . )",
    "are very similar to what is generally found in other agn . in our new interpretation",
    ", this gas can therefore be found in its usual location , @xmath241000  pc from the black hole at the center of the galaxy .",
    "lccc h@xmath3 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0 + @xmath25}3727 $ ] & 1.5 & 2.6 & 3.2 + @xmath26}5007 $ ] & 6.7 & 10.1 & 5.0 + @xmath27}3869 $ ] & 1.8 & 0.7 & 1.4 + @xmath28}3426 $ ] & 4.0 & 0.3 & 1.2 +    the detailed character of this emission line system is one place where the analogy with ngc  1275 may break down .",
    "the line emission at the systemic velocity in ngc  1275 is likely affected by a number of processes in addition to agn photoionization @xcite that may have their origin in special properties of the cluster environment .",
    "some of these processes may also influence the narrow emission lines associated directly with the quasar sdssj0927 .",
    "however , its luminosity is so much greater than that of the seyfert galaxy ngc  1275 that the relative importance of these other processes may be smaller ; perhaps that is why its line ratios so closely resemble those of a generic agn .",
    "the relative fluxes of the narrow lines in the redshifted system in sdssj0927 are also similar to the narrow emission - line regions in agn : 1.0 , 2.6 , 10.1 , 0.7 , and 0.3 , where the lines are listed in the same order as before and also given in table  1 . in the model we favor , this emission would come from gas in the small galaxy that has fallen in from outer regions of the cluster , but is now close enough to the quasar that the gas is photoionized by the quasar continuum .",
    "the power source for the redshifted emission lines is different from the case of ngc  1275 where ( owing to the relatively small ionizing luminosity of the agn ) the emitting gas in the infalling galaxy is photoionized by hot stars within the galaxy itself .    without going into an extensive photoionization analysis",
    ", we can use the emission - lines in the redshifted system in sdssj0927 to see if its basic physical properties are consistent with our model .",
    "the flux ratio of the two members of the [ oii]3726,3729 doublet is 1@xmath290.1 , implying an electron density @xmath30 @xmath22 @xcite . in our model",
    "this would be gas that , in the absence of a nearby quasar , would reside in cold hi clouds in the ism of a normal galaxy .",
    "the emission measure inferred from the h@xmath3 luminosity is @xmath31  @xmath32 ( we remeasured both the h@xmath3 and the continuum flux in the sdss spectrum , and assume @xmath33  km  s@xmath0  mpc@xmath0 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the implied gas mass is then simply the emission measure divided by the mean density , so that @xmath36 , an entirely plausible gas mass for the irradiated dense clouds in the hypothesized infalling galaxy .",
    "we can estimate the distance from the qso to this infalling galaxy by using the emission line ratios to estimate the ionization parameter in the gas due to exposure to the quasar continuum : @xmath37^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath38 is the ionizing luminosity of the quasar , @xmath39 is the distance from the gas to the quasar , and @xmath40 is the ionization parameter .",
    "assuming that @xmath41 = 5 $ ] , we find that the quasar ionizing luminosity is @xmath42  erg  s@xmath0 .",
    "the ionization parameter appropriate to the observed [ oiii]5007/h@xmath3 ratio is @xmath43 @xcite , while we measure @xmath44 @xmath22 ( we caution , however , that the [ nev ] line indicates that there is a significant amount of gas in a higher ionization state , so a simple one - zone model may be somewhat misleading ) .",
    "the implied physical separation between the quasar and hypothesized infalling galaxy is then 8  kpc ( similar to the transverse separation between the two systems seen in ngc  1275 ) . if the typical column density of this gas is comparable to the column density of gas in a galactic disk , @xmath45  @xmath46 , it would be optically thick at the lyman edge , so all the incident ionizing photons would be absorbed and reprocessed .",
    "the ratio of the ionizing luminosity from the quasar to the narrow h@xmath3 emission line implies that the irradiated gas would cover a solid angle of @xmath470.2 steradians , or an area of 12 kpc@xmath48 for a separation of 8 kpc .",
    "thus , in all respects that we can measure from the existing data , the properties of the redshifted narrow emission - line system are fully compatible with our hypothesis that sdssj0927 is a higher redshift version of the ngc  1275 system : a galaxy falling into the deep potential well of a rich cluster of galaxies where it interacts with the host galaxy of an agn .",
    "this model makes a number of predictions that can be readily tested by observations .",
    "first , if stellar absorption lines can be detected in this object s spectrum , their centroid should be close to the bluer system s velocity , and they might be doubled , with a separation @xmath49  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we recognize , however , that it is in general difficult to detect stellar absorption lines in quasar spectra because they are usually so strongly diluted by the quasar continuum .",
    "in addition , high - resolution optical imaging ( e.g. , using _ hst _ ) , should detect some extended light , perhaps exhibiting irregular structure due to the galaxy - galaxy interaction we suggest is occurring .",
    "secondly , there should be a rich cluster surrounding this object .",
    "the left panel of figure  2 shows a color sdss cutout 2  on a side , centered on sdssj0927 .",
    "this corresponds to a physical size of @xmath50  kpc at the redshift of the quasar .",
    "a number of faint red galaxies are visible , particularly to the southwest of the quasar . in the right - hand panel",
    ", we plot a histogram of photometric redshifts for galaxies in this field , using redshifts derived from template fitting and made available in the photoz table @xcite .",
    "typical quoted errors for the photometric redshifts are @xmath51 .",
    "it is clear that in the region as a whole there is an overdensity of galaxies with redshifts slightly less than that of the quasar ; the small shift is likely an artifact of the photo-@xmath52 template fitting , rather than a real difference between the quasar redshift and that of the galaxies in this concentration .",
    "particularly noteworthy , nearly all the faint red galaxies noted in the sw quadrant of the image have redshifts within 2 standard errors of 0.7 ( shaded part of the histogram ) ; the two exceptions in the sw quadrant with photo-@xmath52s of @xmath53 also have photo-@xmath52s determined though the alternative , neural network method , and these estimates would place them at @xmath54 as well . each of these galaxies , if actually at @xmath55 , would be within 425  kpc ( projected ) of sdssj0927 .",
    "although the existence of @xmath56 co - located galaxies does not ensure that a massive cluster is present , at least five of the red galaxies in the sw quadrant have @xmath52-band absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath57 , again assuming that they are at @xmath58 . at this luminosity , each of these galaxies would have a stellar mass @xmath59 if they have seds typical of early - type cluster galaxies at @xmath58 .",
    "such a concentration of massive galaxies within a few hundred kpc of each other suggests that we are indeed viewing the brightest members of a massive cluster , and not just a smaller group of galaxies .",
    "further evidence in favor of both a galaxy cluster surrounding this quasar and interaction between the quasar s host galaxy and members of this cluster comes from the deep @xmath60 co - addition of all five sdss images shown in figure  3 .",
    "this image reveals that sdssj0927 has two close companions within 40  kpc projected radius , once again assuming that they , too , are at @xmath58 .",
    "the object to the lower left ( se ) has an entry in the sdss photometric catalog and a photo-@xmath52 placing it in the apparent cluster at @xmath610.7 .",
    "the object to the north of the quasar has no redshift estimate , but its larger spatial extent stretching toward the quasar suggests the possibility that light from this galaxy may contaminate the sdss spectrum .",

    "all non - black pixels represent a significant detection of object flux , and the red circle indicates the size of the sdss spectroscopic fiber.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a third prediction is that spatially - resolved spectroscopy should reveal a spatial offset between the two narrow line systems . at the distance of sdssj0927 , 8",
    "kpc corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "even if the system is partially projected along the line of sight , for most orientations the expected separation should be large enough for a long - slit spectrum to reveal easily any shift in centroid between the two emission line sets .",
    "in fact , the ne galaxy seen in figure  3 actually extends to very close to the position of the quasar .",
    "perhaps the redshifted emission - line system is associated with the portion of this galaxy nearest to the quasar ( inside the sdss @xmath63 fiber ) .",
    "fourth , a cluster whose potential is deep enough to produce an orbital speed of 2600  km  s@xmath0  should be a bright x - ray source .",
    "@xcite found two observations in the rosat archives and estimated the x - ray luminosity at @xmath64  erg  s@xmath0 .",
    "although an x - ray luminosity of this magnitude would be expected from a quasar having the observed optical luminosity , this luminosity would also be typical of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "it is possible that the x - rays come from both sources .    if these observations had been pointed toward sdssj0927 , the angular resolution of rosat ( half - power width @xmath65 )",
    "would have been great enough to clearly distinguish a point - source from an extended source , as this half - power width translates to 36  kpc at @xmath66 .",
    "however , in both observations , sdssj0927 was near the edge of the field of view , so the resolution was somewhat degraded by imperfections in the rosat mirror .",
    "in addition , confidence in an observational estimate of this source s angular extent is also undercut by the small number of counts detected : 70 in one observation , 47 in the other .",
    "chandra _ nor _ xmm - newton _ observations of this field have been obtained so far .",
    "we believe that , in contrast to more exotic interpretations involving binary black holes and black hole merger events , the most plausible interpretation of the sdss quasar sdssj0927 is that it is a system much like ngc  1275 : an agn lying near the center of a rich cluster of galaxies , interacting with a smaller galaxy that has fallen toward it from farther out in the cluster .",
    "there is a very strong phenomenological resemblance between the two systems ( the offset velocity is actually about @xmath67 smaller in the sdss object ) , and there are none of the physical conundra that cause concern about the black hole binary interpretations .",
    "our arguments also suggest that the correct interpretation of double - peaked emission line profiles can be a subtle problem .",
    "two well - separated peaks in a profile do demand two separate regions with dynamical coherence in which gas suitable for line emission is gathered .",
    "how that coherence is maintained is another matter : a pair of massive black holes could account for two deep gravitational potential minima , but so could two dense stellar clusters , or one black hole and one stellar cluster . for that matter , there can also be cases in which the gas concentrations are not due to gravity , but to jet working surfaces .",
    "moreover , as we have pointed out , two separate line emission regions do not necessarily require two separate sources of ionizing photons .",
    "the strongest evidence for two sources of ionizing photons is two spatially separated regions of continuum emission .",
    "this work was partially supported by the nasa ltsa program ( tmh ) and nsf grant ast-0507455 ( jhk ) .",
    "we would also like to thank the organizers of the jhu monday evening `` wine and cheese '' seminar for providing the stimulus for this project .",
