    "this paper is concerned with blow - up issues and the long - time behavior of solutions to davey - stewartson ( ds ) ii type systems , @xmath0 where @xmath1 takes the values @xmath2 , and where @xmath3 is a dispersion parameter which depending on the circumstances may be small or of order one . since @xmath3 has the same role as the @xmath4 in the schrdinger equation , the limit @xmath5 is also called the semiclassical limit in this context .",
    "it can be introduced in the ds system for @xmath6 via a transformation @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "since we are in particular interested in the study of the long - time behavior of solutions , this is equivalent to the small @xmath3 behavior in @xmath10 . at the same time , small @xmath3 implies the study of solutions on large scales of @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that this limit @xmath5 can be conveniently handled numerically .",
    "the alternative would be to study the system ( [ dsii ] ) for long times on larger domains , which is of course equivalent numerically to the case of small @xmath3 .",
    "the general davey - stewartson systems are a simplification of the benney - roskes , zakharov - rubenchik systems ( @xcite ) who in turn are `` universal '' models for the description of interaction of short and long waves .",
    "they were first derived in the context of water waves ( @xcite ) in the so - called modulational ( schrdinger ) regime , and then @xmath12 is the mean flow induced by the interaction of oscillating modes ( see @xcite for more details and references and for a rigorous derivation of the davey - stewartson systems for water waves ) .",
    "they were also rigorously proven in @xcite to provide a good approximate solution to general quadratic hyperbolic systems using diffractive geometric optics .",
    "in fact they have been formally derived in many concrete physical contexts , ferromagnetism @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the davey - stewartson systems can also be viewed as the two - dimensional version of the _ zakharov - schulman _ systems ( see @xcite ) which read in dimension @xmath13    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    are second order differential operators with constant coefficients , the matrices @xmath16 being real and symmetric ( but not necessarily positive or negative ) . when @xmath17 , the zakharov - schulman systems reduce in fact to davey - stewartson systems .",
    "it is worth noticing that schulman @xcite has proven that among the systems obtained in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 cases , the only ones which are integrable are those previously known in the two - dimensional cases , that is the ds i and ds ii systems ( see below ) . in particular ,",
    "none of them are integrable in the three - dimensional case .",

    "_ ds i and ds ii systems _ are integrable , but very particular cases of respectively elliptic - hyperbolic and hyperbolic - elliptic davey - stewartson systems .",
    "in fact they correspond to a very special choice of the coefficients in or that have limited physical relevance ( in the context of water waves they occur in the shallow water limit , see @xcite ) .",
    "one may hope however that they will give some insights into the dynamics of the corresponding non integrable systems for which standard pde tools provide only local well - posedness results ( global for small data ) without any qualitative information .",
    "the hyperbolic - hyperbolic case does not seem to occur in a physical situation .",
    "the elliptic - elliptic ds systems may possess blow - up solutions by focusing ( see @xcite ) , similarly to the focusing cubic nls .",
    "numerical simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the elliptic - hyperbolic case offers the more challenging mathematical and numerical problems .",
    "the local cauchy problem has been first studied by linares and ponce in @xcite ( see @xcite for the best known results so far ) . the global existence of small solutions with the large time asymptotic ) was proven in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for numerical simulations .    a precise asymptotic of small solutions to the _ integrable _ ds i system is given in @xcite .    the ds ii type systems are thus the hyperbolic - elliptic ones .",
    "they are in particular relevant for surface gravity waves without surface tension ( see @xcite for a rigorous justification ) .",
    "the ds ii type systems for water waves reduce in the infinite depth limit to the `` hyperbolic '' nonlinear schrdinger equation    @xmath36    which was derived in @xcite as a model of gravity waves in the modulation regime and in infinite depth",
    ".    the present paper will be uniquely devoted to the ds ii type systems .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 in determines the contribution of the mean field @xmath12 to the nonlinearity in the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . for @xmath38",
    "one obtains the hyperbolic nls equation , for @xmath39 a completely integrable system .",
    "there is a focusing ( @xmath40 ) and a defocusing ( @xmath41 ) version of ds ii type systems except for @xmath38 . in the case of the hyperbolic nls ,",
    "there is always one focusing and one defocusing direction . a change of sign of @xmath1 in this case just interchanges ( up to complex conjugation ) the role of the spatial variables .",
    "the ds ii system can be viewed as a nonlocal cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "actually one can solve @xmath12 as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a zero order operator with fourier symbol @xmath44 and is thus bounded in all @xmath45 spaces , @xmath46 and all sobolev spaces @xmath47 allowing to write as    @xmath48    one easily finds that ( [ dsii ] ) has two formal conservation laws , the @xmath49 norm    @xmath50    and the energy ( hamiltonian ) @xmath51 dxdy\\nonumber\\\\ & = & e(\\psi(0 ) ) .",

    "thus we solve the ds ii system in the form ( [ dsiibis ] ) in fourier space .",
    "note that the integrable case @xmath39 is distinguished by the fact that the same hyperbolic operator appears in the linear and in the nonlinear part . in this case",
    "the equation is invariant under the transformation @xmath54 and @xmath55 and can be written in a `` symmetric '' form as    @xmath56    where @xmath57    this extra symmetry in the integrable case could be responsible for the existence of localized lump solutions and to the blow - up phenomena that do not not seem persist in the non integrable case .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows .",
    "we first recall some rigorous known results on the cauchy problem for the ds ii type systems .",
    "it turns out that inverse scattering techniques allow to provide very precise information on the dynamics of the ds ii systems , both in the integrable focusing and defocusing cases .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to investigate numerically to what extent those dynamics are generic in the sense that they hold also in the non integrable cases .",
    "this issue motivates the numerical simulations of section 3 which suggest that the blow - up which occurs in the focusing ds ii system does not persist in the ( focusing ) non integrable case , while the purely dispersive regime of the defocusing ds ii system seems to persist in the ( defocusing ) non integrable case .",
    "the following notations will be used throughout this article .",
    "the partial derivative with be denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "for any @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the riesz and bessel potentials of order @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the fourier transform of a function @xmath63 is denoted by @xmath64 or @xmath65 for @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the usual lebesgue space with the norm @xmath68 , and for @xmath69 , the sobolev spaces @xmath70 are defined via the usual norm @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 will denote the schwartz spaces of smooth rapidly decaying functions , and @xmath73 the space of tempered distributions .",
    "as previously noticed the ds ii type systems can be reduced to a nonlocal cubic ( hyperbolic ) nonlinear schrdinger equation ( hnls ) , and the local cauchy problem theory for the cubic nls extends to the ds ii systems .",
    "namely one has the following local well - posedness result ( @xcite ) :    [ gs ] ( i ) let @xmath74 there exists a unique maximal solution @xmath75 of on @xmath76 , @xmath77 such that @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    \\(ii ) if @xmath81 is sufficiently small , then @xmath82 the solution is global .",
    "\\(iii ) if @xmath83 the previous solution satisfies @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 for every @xmath87 and @xmath88 + moreover , @xmath89    \\(i ) results in theorem [ gs ] do not distinguish between a _ focusing _ and a _ defocusing case_. in fact they rely only on the dispersive ( strichartz ) estimates for the linear group @xmath90 which are the same as those of the standard schrdinger group ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since is @xmath49 critical , the maximal existence time @xmath91 does not depend only on the @xmath49 norm of the initial data @xmath92 , but on @xmath92 in a more complicated way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this explains why the conservation of the @xmath49 norm of the solution does not imply global well - posedness .",
    "\\(ii ) the global existence result in part ( ii ) of theorem [ gs ] does not provide any large time asymptotic .",
    "\\(iii ) in the @xmath93 context , the conservation of energy does not yield any @xmath93 bound since its quadratic part is not positive definite .",
    "\\(iv ) all the previous considerations apply as well to the hyperbolic nls for which global existence with scattering is conjectured ( see the numerical simulations below ) .",
    "more can be said in the integrable case ( @xmath94 where the addition of a nonlocal cubic term to the hyperbolic nls equation may have dramatic effects in the focusing case .",
    "moreover the integrability provides in the defocusing case results that would be difficult to obtain by pure pde techniques .",
    "in particular , sung ( @xcite ) has proven the following    [ dssung ] let @xmath95 . then possesses a unique global solution @xmath96 such that the mapping @xmath97 belongs to @xmath98 in the two cases :    \\(i ) defocusing .",
    "\\(ii ) focusing and @xmath99 where @xmath100 is an explicit constant .",
    "moreover , there exists @xmath101 such that    @xmath102    we recall that such a result is unknown for the general _ non integrable _ ds - ii systems , and also for the hyperbolic cubic nls .",
    "sung obtains in fact the global well - posedness ( without the decay rate ) in the defocusing case under the assumption that @xmath103 and @xmath104 for some @xmath105 see @xcite .",
    "recently , perry @xcite has given a more precise asymptotic behavior in the defocusing case for initial data in @xmath106 proving that the solution obeys the asymptotic behavior in the @xmath107 norm :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the solution of the linearized problem .",
    "we should emphasize again that this kind of result is out of reach of the present pde techniques . as previously said ,",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to give numerical evidence that this behavior persists in the non integrable defocusing case .    on the other hand ,",
    "the integrable focusing ds ii system possesses a family of localized solitary waves ( @xcite ) , the lumps    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are constants . the lump moves with constant velocity @xmath113 and decays as @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "again in the focusing integrable case , ozawa @xcite has constructed an explicit solution of the cauchy problem whose @xmath49 norm blows up in finite time @xmath91 .",
    "in fact the mass density @xmath116 of the solution converges as @xmath117 to a dirac measure with total mass @xmath118 ( a weak form of the conservation of the @xmath49 norm ) .",
    "every regularity breaks down at the blow - up point but the solution persists after the blow - up time and disperses in the sup norm when @xmath119 as @xmath120 the construction of the blow - up solution is obtained by applying the pseudo - conformal invariance law which holds for davey - stewartson systems ( see @xcite ) to a lump solitary wave ( see above ) . more precisely ,    let @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "denote by @xmath123 the function defined by @xmath124 where @xmath125 then , @xmath96 is a solution of ( [ dsii ] ) with @xmath126 and @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the dirac measure .",
    "note that this construction is reminiscent of a similar one for the @xmath49 critical focusing nls in @xmath129    @xmath130    constructed via a pseudo - conformal transformation applied to a ground state solution of nls .",
    "it is well known ( @xcite and the references therein ) that this blow - up is non generic for ( it does not give the generic blow - up rate ) .",
    "however the blow - up shown by ozawa is very different from the nls one .",
    "first , it is an @xmath49 blow - up and not an @xmath93 one ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "lastly , the solution extends beyond the blow - up time and then scatters as @xmath132 more precisely , it is shown in @xcite that there exists a unique ( explicit ) @xmath133 such that    @xmath134 denotes the unitary group @xmath135    recall that no blow - up occurs for ds ii type equation with initial data small enough in @xmath49but a precise @xmath49 bound is not known .. where @xmath136 is the ground state solution of the focusing @xmath49 critical nls .",
    "] there is such a criterion in theorem [ dssung ] ( this is not an @xmath49 one ) and one can ask whether or not it is optimal in sung functional setting .",
    "we do not know of a proof of a blow - up for the focusing ds ii equation occurring for initial data different from the above construction ( say a gaussian with sufficiently large mass ) .",
    "our numerical simulations suggest that blow - up actually may occur in this situation which is not theoretically well understood .",
    "the `` ozawa blow - up '' is carefully studied numerically in @xcite illustrating in particular that the ozawa solution is unstable .",
    "the same `` structural instability '' is shown as in @xcite for the ds ii lump ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , our numerical simulations below suggest that neither an ozawa type blow - up nor another type of generic blow - up persist in the non integrable case .",
    "since ozawa s blow - up is obtained by using both the existence of a lump solution and of a pseudo - conformal law , one may first ask whether such a transformation exist for general ds type systems .",
    "in fact it was established in @xcite that this is the indeed the case for the more general zakharov - schulman systems .",
    "for instance , assuming that the matrix @xmath137 is invertible and denoting by @xmath138 the following quadratic form on @xmath139 :    @xmath140    one observes as noticed in @xcite , that , assuming that @xmath141 or equivalently @xmath75 is a solution of ( resp . ) , then @xmath142 defined by    @xmath143    @xmath144    is also a solution . ]",
    "this implies that a finite time blow - up occurs provided there exists a _",
    "localized _ solitary wave solution of the form @xmath145 ( see corollary 3.1 in @xcite for zakharov - schulman systems in dimension two and three ) . on top of the focusing integrable ds ii system we analyzed above",
    ", this can be the case for elliptic - elliptic davey - stewartson systems .",
    "we refer to @xcite for theoretical issues on ground state solutions of elliptic - elliptic ds systems and the possible associated blow - up and to @xcite for numerical analysis of the blow - up .",
    "we again emphasize that a refined analysis _",
    " la merle - raphal @xcite _ is still missing for elliptic - elliptic ds systems .",
    "it is well known that hyperbolic nls equations such as do not possess solitary waves of the form @xmath146 where @xmath96 is localized ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that non trivial solitary waves may exist for ds ii type systems only when @xmath147 ( focusing case ) and @xmath148 note that the ( focusing ) integrable case corresponds to @xmath149 moreover solitary waves with _ radial _ ( up to translation ) profiles can exist only when @xmath41 and @xmath39 , that is in the focusing integrable case .",
    "those results suggest that solitary waves for the focusing ds ii systems exist only in the integrable case and this might be due to the new symmetry of the system we were alluding to above in this case .    to summarize , one is led to conjecture that neither the existence of the lump nor the associated ozawa blow - up persist in the focusing ds ii non integrable case",

    "an interesting question is that of its _ transversal _ stability with respect of .",
    "this issue has been investigated theoretically by rousset and tzvetkov for various nonlinear dispersive pde s ( @xcite ) , in particular for the cubic two - dimensional nls , but not to our knowledge in the context of davey - stewartson systems .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that the kdv line soliton is unstable for short wave transverse perturbations in the context of the hyperbolic nls . a numerical study for the hyperbolic nls and",
    "the integrable ds ii system can be found in @xcite .",
    "we plan to come back to theoretical and numerical issues for the non integrable ds ii systems in a subsequent work .",
    "on the other hand , an explicit formula is given in @xcite for the interaction of an n - line soliton and a lump of the integrable focusing ds ii system .",
    "since the lump does not seem to persist in the non integrable case , this situation has probably no counterpart then .",
    "in this section , we discuss the numerical methods used to compute the time - evolution of the solution and in particular how to identify the type of blow - up in case certain norms of the solution diverge .      for the numerical integration of , we use a fourier spectral method in @xmath156 .",
    "the reasons for this choice are the excellent approximation properties of spectral methods for smooth functions , and the minimal introduction of numerical dissipation which ( in principle ) could overwhelm the dispersive effects of ds ii we want to study .",
    "the discretization in fourier space leads to a system of ( stiff ) ordinary differential equations for the fourier coefficients of @xmath96 of the form @xmath157 where @xmath158 , and where @xmath159 denotes the nonlinearity .",
    "it is an advantage of fourier methods that the derivatives and thus the operator @xmath160 are diagonal . for equations of the form ( [ fnlsfourier ] ) with diagonal @xmath160 , there are many efficient high - order time integrators . for ds",

    "it was shown that in the focusing case a _",
    "composite runge - kutta method _",
    "@xcite performed best , which we will also use in the defocusing case .",
    "the numerical precision is controlled via the numerically computed energy ( [ energy ] ) due to unavoidable numerical errors , the computed energy will depend on time .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the quantity @xmath161 can be used as an indicator of the numerical accuracy that overestimates the @xmath162 norm of the difference between numerical and exact solution by roughly two orders of magnitude .",
    "we always aim at a @xmath163 smaller than @xmath164 which guarantees plotting accuracy , and typically we achieve @xmath165 or better .",
    "a useful tool in the numerical study of blow - up in nls equations are dynamically rescaled codes , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) and references therein . for the elliptic - elliptic ds , this was used in @xcite to study numerically blow - up in this system and to show that the latter behaves essentially as the standard nls . using the same technique for the focusing ds ii",
    ", we put @xmath166 equation ( [ dsiibis ] ) implies for @xmath167 @xmath168 where @xmath169 . under this rescaling ,",
    "the @xmath170 norm of @xmath96 with respect to @xmath156 and @xmath171 is equal to the @xmath170 norm of @xmath167 with respect to @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath174 can be chosen in a way that @xmath175 vanishes for @xmath176 corresponding to @xmath177 , the blow - up time .",
    "it is then expected at blow - up that both @xmath178 and @xmath179 become @xmath180-independent .",
    "equation ( [ dsiiresc ] ) then becomes a pde in @xmath172 and @xmath173 only which would give the asymptotic profile of the selfsimilar blow - up .",
    "there is no reason to believe that this equation reduces to an ode in generic situations , nor that it has radially symmetric solutions in this case . for @xmath181 , a case which",
    "is not expected for blow - up in nls solutions , these would be defining equations for solitary waves .",
    "the choice of the scaling factor @xmath182 is done for numerical convenience .",
    "typically it is fixed by demanding that one of the norms diverging at blow - up for @xmath96 is kept constant , for instance the @xmath183 norm of @xmath167 .",
    "numerically it is better though to keep an integral norm of @xmath167 constant .",
    "since the @xmath170 norm is anyway invariant , we choose the @xmath170 norm of the @xmath172-derivative .",
    "this leads to @xmath184 where @xmath185 is chosen to be constant .",
    "we can read off the time - evolution of @xmath174 from ( [ l ] ) and by differentiating the @xmath170 norm of @xmath186 with respect to @xmath180 and by using ( [ dsiiresc ] ) to eliminate the @xmath180-derivatives , which leads after some partial integrations to @xmath187    this allows us in principle to study the type of the blow - up for ds ii in a similar way as it has been done for generalized korteweg - de vries equations in @xcite by numerically integrating ( [ dsiiresc ] ) .",
    "but it was shown numerically in @xcite that generic rapidly decreasing hump - like initial data lead to a tail of dispersive oscillations towards spatial infinity with slowly decreasing amplitude . due to the imposed periodicity ( in our numerical domain ) , these oscillations reappear after some time on the opposing side of the computational domain and lead to numerical instabilities in the dynamically rescaled equation .",
    "the source of these problems are the terms @xmath188 in ( [ dsiiresc ] ) since @xmath172 , @xmath173 are large at the boundaries of the computational domain , which has to be chosen large enough to allow for the ` zooming in ' effect due to a smaller and smaller @xmath174 .",
    "small numerical errors tend to be amplified by these terms . for gkdv",
    "this could be addressed by using high resolution in time and large computational domains , a resolution which is difficult to achieve for @xmath189 dimensions . for ds",
    "ii there is the additional problem of the _ modulational instability _ of focusing nls equations which shows in numerical computations in the form of an increase of the fourier coefficients for the high wave numbers .",
    "the consequence of this is that we can not compute long enough with the dynamically rescaled code to get conclusive results .",
    "instead we integrate ds ii directly , as described above , and then we use some post - processing to characterize the type of blow - up via the above rescaling ( [ resc ] ) and ( [ l2x ] ) .    under the hypothesis that @xmath190 close to blow - up with @xmath191 some positive constant , ( [ resc ] ) yields a connection between @xmath10 and @xmath180 , @xmath192 with ( [ l ] ) and ( [ resc ] ) , this implies @xmath193 in the mass critical case for nls , one finds a correction to in the form @xmath194 i.e. , one has @xmath195 instead of @xmath196 .",
    "this so - called log - log - scaling regime for mass critical nls has been rigorously proved in @xcite .",
    "it can not be expected that logarithmic corrections can be seen in our simulations .      in the case of fractional nls equations with cubic nonlinearity ,",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the codes continue to run even if a finite - time blow - up is reached .",
    "this is in contrast to nls equations with higher nonlinearity where the @xmath183 norm of the solution becomes so large that the computation of the nonlinear terms in the equation leads to an overflow error .",
    "since the nonlinearity of nls is also cubic , we identify an appearing singularity as follows ( see also @xcite ) : recall that in the complex plane , a ( single ) singularity @xmath197 of a real function @xmath63 , such that @xmath198 , with @xmath199 , results in the following asymptotic behavior for the corresponding fourier transform @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "the quantity @xmath202 thereby characterizes the type of the singularity .    in @xcite",
    "this approach was used to quantitatively identify the time where the singularity hits the real axis , i.e. , where the real solution becomes singular , since it was shown that the quantity @xmath128 can be reliably identified from a fitting of the fourier coefficients .",
