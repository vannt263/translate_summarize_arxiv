    "determining the relationship between the pseudogap phase and the superconducting ( sc ) properties of hole - doped cuprates has been a primary challenge to understanding high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "some time ago , emery and kivelson suggested that the phase order associated with the complex order parameter of the sc state goes away at a temperature proportional to the superfluid density , and vanishes below the lower critical doping for bulk superconductivity.@xcite the pseudogap phase in their model is associated with preformed cooper pairs , but superconductivity is inhibited by large phase fluctuations . to date",
    "there are a number of experiments @xcite that provide compelling evidence for the existence of sc fluctuations within the pseudogap state of hole - doped cuprates above @xmath1 .",
    "while in the past it was often assumed that such sc fluctuations reside in a homogeneous environment , recent x - ray scattering and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments have collectively established that the normal state of underdoped cuprates also includes incommensurate charge order ( co ) fluctuations.@xcite x - ray scattering measurements show the incommensurate co emerging just below the pseudogap temperature @xmath2 in bi@xmath3sr@xmath4la@xmath5cuo@xmath6,@xcite but far below @xmath2 in underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( ybco).@xcite the co fluctuations are two - dimensional in that they are characterized by a substantially longer maximum correlation length in the in - plane direction ( _ i.e. _ 20 to 100   ) , and in x - ray experiments have been demonstrated to compete with superconductivity below @xmath1.@xcite these experimental findings indicate a universal intrinsic incipient charge instability in high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductors , which may play a pivotal role in limiting the temperature extent of bulk superconductivity .",
    "recently , transverse - field muon spin rotation ( tf-@xmath0sr ) experiments have also provided evidence for an intrinsic source of electronic inhomogeneity in superconducting cuprates above @xmath1.@xcite a generic spatially inhomogeneous response to an applied magnetic field is detected in la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath9 ( lsco ) , bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath10 ( bscco ) and ybco , extending to temperatures well above @xmath1 .",
    "the experimental observation is a residual depolarization of the tf-@xmath0sr time spectrum , quantified by an exponential relaxation rate @xmath11 , which is proportional to the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of a lorentzian distribution of internal magnetic field .",
    "the proportionality constant is the muon gyromagnetic ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 increases for stronger applied field , tracks @xmath1 as a function of hole doping @xmath13 , and in ybco is reduced near @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 is found to scale with the maximum value of @xmath1 for each family of compounds .",
    "these observations are explained by the occurrence of inhomogeneous sc fluctuations above @xmath1 , driven by an intrinsic rearrangement of the electronic structure@xcite  presumably associated with a competing order of some kind and likely related to the co instability mentioned above .",
    "hayward et al.@xcite have recently modeled competing co and sc correlations in the pseudogap phase by angular fluctuations of a multi - component order parameter .",
    "the model reproduces the temperature dependence of the x - ray scattering intensity of co correlations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath7o@xmath15 , and has been used to characterize the contribution of sc fluctuations to the bulk diamagnetic susceptibility.@xcite however , this model does not describe the spatial inhomogeneity that may arise from these competing orders.@xcite here we propose a model of spatially static segregated co and sc correlations in the pseudogap phase to describe the hole - doping dependence of the tf-sr data , with an understanding that in the absence of fluctuations our theory will not accurately reproduce the temperature dependence of the tf-@xmath0sr relaxation rate .    to address early evidence of spatial charge inhomogeneity in cuprate superconductors ,",
    "@xcite one of us proposed that there exists an electronic phase separation transition associated with two competing phases having the same ginzburg - landau free energy minima.@xcite such a transition can be studied by the time dependent cahn - hilliard ( ch ) equation , since the average doping level is independent of temperature .",
    "the two phases develop as small - sized regions of low and high charge density , which may favor the formation of localized cooper pairs  a situation akin to that of a granular superconductor.@xcite .",
    "this is possible because the sc coherence length of cuprate superconductors is quite short , and of the order of the co correlation length .",
    "here we apply the same approach to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of @xmath11 from the tf-@xmath0sr experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe simulations of charge inhomogeneity in small regions or patches using the time - dependent ch equation .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of calculations of the local @xmath16-wave pairing amplitude by the bogoliubov - degennes method .",
    "the main purpose of these two sections is to provide a theoretical framework for simulating the distribution of local pairing gaps observed by stm on bscco . in sec .",
    "iv we apply the critical - state bean model with a spatially varying shielding current density @xmath17 that is related to the local @xmath16-wave pair potential @xmath18 to describe the spatial dependence of the local magnetic field @xmath19 within the superconducting regions or patches . the calculated line width of the corresponding field distribution is then shown to differ somewhat from the hole - doping dependence of the tf-@xmath0sr line width observed above @xmath1 in ref .  .",
    "in sec .  v we consider another approach ; the small - sized superconducting domains form a granular superconductor coupled by the josephson coupling energy @xmath20 , which increases as the temperature is lowered towards @xmath1 .",
    "we show that this approach is able to provide a better description of the doping evolution of the tf-@xmath0sr data above @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we use the ch approach to phenomenologically simulate an inhomogeneous charge distribution that is compatible with experimental findings .",
    "even before the recent detection of incommensurate co there were experimental indications that nanoscale phase separation is a universal phenomenon of cuprates,@xcite as well as other strongly correlated electron systems like manganites.@xcite motivated by these observations , one of us developed a theory in which the free energy of a system with average charge - carrier doping @xmath13 may be lowered by charge segregation into low and high doping regions.@xcite the temperature @xmath21 at which such phase separation occurs was evaluated in these prior calculations , and found to increase with decreasing @xmath13 in a manner closely resembling the pseudogap temperature @xmath22.@xcite this implies that the degree of charge disorder diminishes with increased doping  a result which is implicit in our simulations here , and a trend which is consistent with a variety of experiments.@xcite    a common way to study the charge segregation process is by way of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy density functional and its usual order parameter power expansion .",

    "the details of this method applied in one or two dimensions are discussed elsewhere.@xcite    before considering the response to an applied field , we examine whether the local superconducting calculations for the simulated electronic phase separation in sec .  ii reproduce the well - documented low temperature gap structure measured on bscco by stm.@xcite these and the @xmath48 calculations provide a framework from which the diamagnetic response of the normal phase can be determined . usually in typical ch simulations ,",
    "the value @xmath49 is chosen because it yields the maximum difference @xmath50 between the order parameters of the two phases.@xcite here we assume @xmath51 , which is approximately equal to 1 at low temperatures , and decreases towards zero as @xmath52 , where the charge density becomes spatially homogeneous .",
    "in the simulations we let the system converge to the @xmath53 limit ( which corresponds to the electronic charge density map shown in fig .  [ pmapfe ] and the histogram in the inset of fig .",

    "is lowered below @xmath35 , the ratio of a / b increases from zero and the free - energy barriers grow in height , which increases the probability of the charges being confined to specific regions . in general , the inter - facial free energy between the two phases has the following temperature dependence , @xmath62$].@xcite these series of free energy wells of average depth @xmath61 are used in the next section to calculate the local @xmath16-wave pairing amplitude .    before finishing this section",
    "it is worth noting that the neighboring low and high charge density domains displayed in fig .",

    "this is less than the maximum in - plane co correlation length of @xmath63 lattice constants in ybco,@xcite but larger than @xmath64 4 to 6 lattice constants measured in bi@xmath3sr@xmath4la@xmath5cuo@xmath6.@xcite",
    "after simulating a two - dimensional charge segregated state , we use this as input for self - consistent calculations of local cooper pairing . the disordered state presented in sec .",

    "a second consequence of the above picture is that _ the clustering process provides a virtual hole - hole attraction_. as the temperature decreases below @xmath35 the charges tend to segregate , forming regions of high and low density . in the low density regime , if two neighboring regions contains one hole each , the holes will `` attract '' one another forming a more stable configuration of one empty region and another with two holes , and form the patches at low temperatures shown in fig .",
    "[ pmapfe ] .",

    "the @xmath67-body interactions are possibly very weak for @xmath68 and hence apparently have no physical consequences",

    "the resulting probability field histogram for various dopings at @xmath144  k and the respective values of @xmath147 along with the experimental data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ musrpsts ] .",
    "the agreement is reasonable considering the approximations made in our model .",
    "now that we have shown that the josephson coupling energy can be used to derive the doping dependent magnetic field response measured in the tf-@xmath0sr experiments , we plot in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] the ratio @xmath148 as a function of hole doping and temperature .",

    "we also show a curve that marks the onset of josephson coupling . by eq .",
    "( [ ej ] ) , this also marks the onset of the pairing amplitude @xmath150 , and hence should be close to the pseudogap temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the curve for @xmath151  k resembles the doping dependence of the measured value @xmath152s@xmath113 above @xmath1 in ref .   with a maximum value below optimal doping . on the other hand , the curve for @xmath153  k resembles the doping dependence of the onset temperature for diamagnetism detected in bscco by torque magnetometry.@xcite these comparisons suggest that the sensitivity of different experimental techniques to the magnetic response of such an inhomogeneous system depends on how strongly the individual sc regions are coupled . as a local magnetic probe",
    ", the muon is sensitive to the diamagnetism of weakly coupled and/or isolated dilute patches , whereas the diamagnetic signal detected at lower temperatures by torque magnetometry presumably comes from regions that are more strongly josephson coupled .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that for the doping range considered , the curve for the smaller value @xmath154  k in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] is systematically higher , but is qualitatively consistent with the doping dependence of the onset temperature for precursor pairing inferred from @xmath155-axis infrared response measurements on ybco.@xcite",
    "we have applied a general phase separation method to simulate small - scale electronic inhomogeneity in the cuo@xmath3 planes of high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductors . using the bdg equations we have calculated the spatially - varying cooper pair potential in this environment , and shown that inhomogeneous superconductivity may occur in this system . with appropriate parameters we can reproduce the measured doping and temperature dependences of the local and average pair potentials of bscco . using these results",
    "we have attempted to calculate the observed doping dependence of the inhomogeneous magnetic field response above @xmath48 detected by tf-@xmath0sr via two different approaches : ( i ) the system is considered to be a single superconductor with electronic inhomogeneity whose average @xmath16-wave pair potential has a dome - shaped hole - doping dependence that yields @xmath48 . in this case",
    "the main source of the inhomogeneous diamagnetic response comes from shielding currents around individual patches , assumed to scale with the cube of the local pair potential @xmath156 .",
    "( ii ) the system is considered to be like a granular superconductor composed of individual patches with local pairing potentials that are connected with one another via josephson coupling of energy @xmath136 . in this case",
    "@xmath48 corresponds to the onset of long - range phase order between the patches , and the source of the inhomogeneous magnetic response comes from varying critical tunneling currents .",
    "this second approach yields better agreement with the tf-@xmath0sr measurements .",
    "we conclude by noting a significant distinction between our model and the interpretation of the tf-@xmath0sr measurements in ref .  .",
    "in the latter it is assumed that the measured temperature - dependent relaxation rate @xmath11 above @xmath1 is caused by a distribution of time - averaged local magnetic fields associated with inhomogeneous sc fluctuations , whereas our model assumes a static distribution of magnetic field .",
    "even so , the formation and effective screening from patches with fluctuating phase - coherent cooper pairs may be controlled by the same parameters , preserving the qualitative behaviors predicted from our model .",
