    "there is a growing interest to the baryon spectroscopy in the light of recent discovery of pentaquark baryon @xmath9 with a positive strangeness and mass value @xmath10 mev and width @xmath11 mev by the leps group at the spring-8 facility in harima , japan @xcite and another pentaquark baryon @xmath12 with @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 mev by the na49 group at cern @xcite .",
    "the minimal possible quark content of the @xmath9 and @xmath12 is @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively and therefore they are called pentaquarks .",
    "the discovery of pentaquarks in particular inspired a new overview on the light hadron spectroscopy , the lowest excitation spectrum of the nucleon and @xmath0 .",
    "one new point here is that the long standing puzzle of the roper resonance @xmath17 is suggested to be resolved with an idea that this baryon state has a pentaquark content @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the long discussed exotic structure of the roper resonance @xcite , the new point requires a detailed study of the lowest excitation spectrum of light baryons .",
    "the most successful study of the spectroscopy of the lowest excited states of the @xmath19 and @xmath0 was done in the traditional one - gluon exchange ( oge ) constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "another prominent , goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) constituent quark model @xcite is based on the idea that the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of qcd plays a crucial role for the hadron structure",
    ". continuing debate of the two above models over last decade @xcite was focused mainly on the so - called `` three - body spin orbit problem '' associated with the oge mechanism .",
    "the authors of the gbe based model claims that the goldstone boson exchange , rather than the gluon exchange , is the source of the hyperfine splitting , and that there is no any spin - orbit splitting between for - example , negative parity @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances , and also between @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonances .",
    "unfortunately , the current status of the experimental data still does not allow to overcome these problems @xcite . although , the new analysis of the experimental data @xcite confirms the splitting in above nucleon and @xmath0 bands .    on the other hand ,",
    "neither of these models of the baryon structure is relativistic and neither is qcd and it is impossible to draw any conclusion concerning the nature of the hyperfine interaction in baryons .",
    "it is clear now that all results of the constituent quark models have to be reexamined in some relativistic quark model . up to now",
    ", the qcd based models like the mit bag @xcite , cloudy bag @xcite and chiral bag @xcite have not been extended to the excited baryon sector .",
    "most detailed study of the masses of light hadrons in cloudy and chiral bag models was done by saito @xcite , however this work also did not include lower excitation spectrum of the nucleon and delta .",
    "the inclusion of the instanton induced interaction mechanism in the frame of the mit bag model @xcite also was restricted to the octet baryons .",
    "the octet and decuplet baryons also were studied successfully in a fully relativistic poincare covariant diquark - quark model based on bethe - salpeter equation @xcite . another model which respects the poincare covariance and which preserves all results of the original cloudy bag model",
    "@xcite is the light front cloudy bag model @xcite .",
    "the model recently was extended for the extrapolation of lattice qcd results to the physical values of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this work have demonstrated the importance of the development of cavity models for hadron structure . on the other hand",
    ", the lattice studies still did not reproduce the main properties of the excited @xmath19 and @xmath0 sector , although the ground states @xmath2 and @xmath21 are described well ( see recent review @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop a relativistic chiral quark model based on field - theoretical description of the interquark interaction for the excited nucleon and @xmath0 spectroscopy .",
    "the model was firstly suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and used for the calculations of the nucleon ground state properties in @xcite . a modification of the model",
    ", the so - called perturbative chiral quark model was recently extended to the systematic study of the nucleon properties @xcite , the mass - spectrum of the octet - baryons @xcite and the pentaquark systems @xcite . in these approaches baryons",
    "are considered as bound states of valence quarks surrounded by a cloud of goldstone bosons ( @xmath22mesons ) as required by the chiral symmetry .    as was found in the model",
    "independent analyses of baryons in the large @xmath4 limit @xcite , the mass splitting between various baryon states receive important contributions from operators which simultaneously couple spin , isospin and orbital momentum . on the other hand ( see @xcite ) , the relativistic structure of the one - meson exchange forces for the ground states of the n and @xmath0 is the same as in the goldstone boson exchange model of glozman et al .",
    ", i.e. it is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are spin and isospin operators respectively .",
    "it is important to note that the above structure of gbe interaction yields the correct ordering of the radially and orbitally excited nucleon resonances , namely the roper resonance @xmath26 and negative parity @xmath27 , @xmath28 resonances @xcite .",
    "we found also that this structure holds for all @xmath29wave baryons ( ground and radially excited baryon states ) .",
    "however the important question , does this structure hold for orbitally excited baryon resonances , is still open . below",
    "we show that in the latter case the one - meson exchange interaction has more complicated structure .",
    "more precisely , it contains additionally an operator which couples the upper orbital momentum of valence quark emitting a single meson with the lower orbital momentum of another valence quark absorbing this meson . in the s - wave limit",
    "this operator is proportional to the spin operator , in other words it supports the above well - known structure .",
    "however , for p- , d- wave baryons the exchange operator yields different matrix elements and the above structure of the one - meson exchange does not hold .",
    "it is clear that this relativistic effect can not be obtained in non - relativistic meson exchange models . as a result",
    "we have a splitting due - to one - meson exchange in the excited baryon sector .",
    "this finding concerns the long - standing `` three - body spin - orbit puzzle '' in baryons .",

    "it means that for the s - wave baryons the relativistic and non - relativistic structure of one - meson exchange are the same .",
    "however for the orbitally excited baryon states ( p- , d- wave baryons ) they are different due - to operator @xmath119 which couples the lower and upper components of the interacting quarks .",

    "in order to account for the finite size effect of the pion we introduce a one - pion vertex regularization function in the momentum space , parameterized in the dipole form as @xmath132 according to the study of long - wavelength transverse fluctuations of the flux - tube @xcite we use the value @xmath133 .",
    "we choose two sets of parameters : model a and model b. the parameters of the confining potential ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) are fitted to reproduce correct axial charge of the proton which remains unaltered when including the effects of the pion cloud , the empirical value of the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath136 and a normal value for the quark core rms radius @xmath137 fm of the proton .",
    "thus , we use only few parameters to reproduce the su(2 ) baryons spectrum contrary to the traditional oge and gbe based quark models .    in table 1",
    "we indicate the model parameters together with the corresponding single - quark energies .",
    "we note here that the first orbitally excited single valence quark level is @xmath138 .",
    "therefore we associate the first orbitally excited nucleon and delta states with the structure @xmath139 .",
    "table 2 contains the quark core results @xcite for the static properties of the proton .",
    "the results include the center of mass correction .",
    "after cm correction , as was shown in @xcite , the magnetic moment of the proton increases by about 20@xmath140 , and the axial charge decreases by about 5@xmath140 .",
    "the cm correction reduces the rms radius of the proton approximately by 10@xmath140 of the uncorrected value . from the table",
    "one can see , that a larger value of the strength parameter @xmath134 of the confining potential yields a smaller value for the rms radius of the proton .",
    "an estimation of the pion - nucleon coupling constant is close to the empirical value for both model a and model b.    perturbative corrections to the lower su(2 ) baryon states energy shift values due - to self - energy diagrams are given in table 3 .",
    "contribution from intermediate quark and antiquark states are taken with the full momentum up to @xmath141 . as was shown in @xcite for the ground state nucleon ,",
    "the pion self - energy contribution is positive and convergent also for excited nucleon and delta states in contrast to the bag models .",
    "contributions from self - energy diagrams for the radially excited nucleon and delta states with the last valence quark in @xmath142 state are larger than for excited nucleon and delta states with the last valence quark in orbitally excited @xmath138 and @xmath143 states .",
    "corresponding energy shift values due - to exchange diagrams are given in table 4 . as we noted above , the relativistic structure of one - meson exchange operator results a splitting between negative parity nucleon resonances and also between delta resonances .",
    "the nucleon states with the structure @xmath139 split according to the energy shift values -132.8 and -150 mev . in contrast to the gbe based quark models , lowest radial excitation of the nucleon @xmath17 which has one valence quark in @xmath142 state , in our model is less bound with 120.35 mev than the lowest orbital excitations of the nucleon @xmath144 and @xmath145 , with 132.8 and 150 mev respectively , which have the last valence quark in @xmath138 state .    in table 5",
    "we give the mass values for the g.s .",
    "n(939 ) with and without cm correction for both parameter sets a and b. in the case of the model a , a reasonable value ( 1280 - 1320 mev ) for the mass of the @xmath0 is obtained . however , for the nucleon ground state the estimation is still large .",
    "model b yields too large value for the mass of the nucleon .",
    "this means that larger values of the strength parameter @xmath134 of the confining potential is not likely . from the table",
    "one can see that the three methods for the correction of center of mass motion agree within 50 mev which seems too large .",
    "however , these three methods always give corrections with systematic differences .",
    "for example , the lho method yields correction larger than the @xmath74 method , but smaller than the @xmath73 method .",
    "thus , we can fix one of these methods and analyse the excited sector .    and",
    "finally in table 6 we compare the theoretical energy splitting values with experimental data from pdg @xcite and recent analysis @xcite .",
    "the new analysis of arndt et al . does not contain the resonance @xmath146 .",
    "we note that the results presented in the last table do not include any correction due - to cm motion .",
    "the quark core and self - energy contributions to the nucleon and delta states with the same structure ( for example @xmath147 ) are equal .",
    "therefore the contributions from quark core and self - energy terms to the @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 splitting are exactly zero . the only correction due - to cm motion in the excited nucleon sector in table 6 is needed for @xmath151 and @xmath152 splitting .",
    "however , we can estimate this correction by using an approximate factor from @xmath153 to @xmath154 .",
    "first of all we note a good agreement of the theoretical value for the splitting of the first radial excitation of the nucleon , roper resonance @xmath17 . the quark core result 415 mev in the model a should restrict to about 200 - 250 mev after cm correction .",
    "that gives a good agreement with the experimental data when adding a perturbative correction ( 284 mev for the model a ) .",
    "however the ordering and splitting of the roper resonance and orbital nucleon excitations @xmath144 and @xmath145 is not reproduced in our model contrary to the non - relativistic constituent quark model of glozman et al .",
    "we suggest that the difference comes mainly from the relativistic structure of the one - meson exchange .",
    "we also note that the splitting between delta states is well reproduced though the last analysis of arndt et al",
    ". shows some different picture .",
    "we demonstrated that a relativistic chiral quark model can yield a reasonable description of the energy spectrum of the ground state @xmath19 and @xmath0 and their lowest radial and orbital excitations .",
    "the model yields a good splitting of the first radial excitation of the nucleon , the roper resonance @xmath3 from ground state @xmath2 and splitting between negative parity nucleon @xmath144 and @xmath145 resonances .",
    "the splitting in the @xmath0 sector also was reproduced .",
    "it is important to note that these results correspond to the parameters of the model , which yield a normal quark core radius of the nucleon , being about 0.5 fm and empirical value of the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath155 .",
    "we found that the relativistic structure of one - meson exchange interaction confirms a prediction of the large @xmath4 approach @xcite , which stated that the mass splitting between various baryons receive important contributions from operators which simultaneously couple spin , isospin and orbital momentum . in particular , the one - pion exchange interaction includes an operator which couples the lower and upper orbital momentum of two interacting valence quarks . in the s - wave limit ( ground and radially excited nucleon and delta states )",
    "this operator is proportional to the simple spin operator .",
    "however , for the orbitally excited baryon resonances it yields different matrix elements and splitting between for example negative parity nucleon resonances and delta resonances . as a result",
    "we conclude that relativistic one - meson exchange interaction does not yield the correct ordering of lowest positive and negative parity nucleon resonances and a new mechanism is needed for the explanation of this effect .    since the developed model gives only a part of the @xmath156 mass splitting and that the delta states are reproduced quite well ,",
    "we see two possible development of the model .",
    "the first is to include instanton induced exchange mechanism , which should give another part of the @xmath156 splitting .",
    "it seems that these forces are responsible for the correct ordering of the radially and orbitally excited nucleon resonances . on the other hand",
    ", they do nt change the spectrum of the delta states and thus keep a good description of this sector .",
    "the second development would include the one - gluon exchange forces which should give some part of the above splitting , and possible inclusion of the instanton induced interaction mechanisms .",
    "the obtained splitting between negative parity nucleon resonances due - to relativistic one - meson exchange forces in our model would cancel a large value of the spin - orbit interaction due - to one - gluon exchange . this would help to understand a long standing `` three body spin - orbit puzzle '' in baryons . + _",
