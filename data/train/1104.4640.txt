    "quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite and quantum anti - zeno effect ( qaze ) qaz are among the most interesting results given by quantum mechanics .",
    "the two effects describe the evolution of a quantum system under repeated ( or continuous ) measurements .",
    "qze shows that , for a closed quantum system with finite - dimensional hilbert space , the unitary evolution can be inhibited by the repeated measurements .",
    "not surprisingly , the similar inhibition can also occurs in the rabi oscillation of a quantum open system coupled with an environment .    on the other hand , for an unstable state in an open quantum system with dissipation",
    ", qze shows that the time - irreversible decay of such a state can be suppressed when the quantum measurements are frequent enough .",
    "in addition to the qze in such an extreme limit , the decay rate of the unstable state in a dissipative system is also possible to be increased if the measurements are repeated with an intermediate \" frequency .",
    "that is known as quantum anti - zeno effect .",
    "qze and qaze have attracted much attention since they were proposed .",
    "so far the two effects have been experimentally observed in the systems of trapped ions @xcite , ultracold atoms expcoldatom1,expcoldatom2,expcoldatom3 , molecules @xcite and cavity quantum electric dynamics ( cavity qed ) @xcite .",
    "the qze and qaze were previously derived with the postulation of wave packet collapse in the quantum measurement .",
    "after the initial proposals of the two effects , many authors have discussed the dynamical explanation of qze and qaze via the unitary quantum mechanical approach without wave packet collapse . for the unitary evolution of a closed system or the rabi oscillation of an open system , many authors pointed out that the qze in these systems can also be explained in a dynamical approach dqze1990,dqze1990b , dqze1990c , dqze1991,dqze1991b , dqze1991c , dqze1991d , dqze1992,dqze1993,dqze1993b , dqze1993c , dqze1994,dqze1994b , dqze1994c , dqze1994d , dqze1994e , dqze1995 , dqze1996,dqze1997 , dqze1998,dqze2010,dqaze2005 .",
    "these explanations are based on the considerations of the quantum dynamics of the quantum system as well as the apparatuses during the measurements . in these complete dynamical analysis",
    ", qze can appear naturally during the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system under the frequent interactions with the apparatuses , and the postulation of wave packet collapse is not required .",
    "these explanations of qze were previously given for many special systems and set - ups for measurements ( e.g. , two - level atoms under the detection with laser pulses ) .",
    "recently some of us ( d. z. xu , qing . ai and c. p. sun ) provided a general dynamical proof of qze for any closed system under quantum non - demolition measurements @xcite .    for the qze and qaze of the decay of an unstable state in a quantum open system with dissipation , there are also similar discussions in which the dynamical process of the measurements is included @xcite . in refs .",
    "dqazehalf2001,dqazehalf2001b , dqazehalf2004,dqazehalf2006 , where the quantum open system is also assumed to be under repeated measurements , the dynamics of every individual measurement is discussed in detail . nevertheless , in these references",
    "the total survival probability of the initial state of the open system is just intuitively calculated as the product of the one after each measurement , rather than derived from the dynamical equation for the total evolution process .",
    "this treatment is appropriate for the cases with ideal projective measurements .",
    "however , as we will show in sec .",
    "iii , in the cases of general measurements which could be non - ideal , a more first - principle analysis is required .",
    "there have also been some full dynamical discussions of qze and qaze in the limit of continuous measurement @xcite ( i.e. , the cases where the system keeps interacting with the measurement apparatus during the total evolution time , or the time interval between two measurements are much smaller than the duration time of each measurement ) or the case of repeated measurements dqaze2010",
    ". however , in these discussions the measurements are performed via several special physical systems , rather than general apparatus . to our knowledge , so far there has not been a _",
    "general _ dynamical explaination for qze and qaze of the unstable states in a quantum open system for arbitrary environment spectrum , environment temperature and system - apparatus coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a general dynamical approach for the qze and qaze of unstable states in a quantum open system . for simplicity ,",
    "we illustrate our central ideas with a two - level system ( tls ) coupled to a heat bath of a multi - mode bosonic field .",
    "as pointed in sec .",
    "vi , it is straightforward to apply our model in open systems and environments of other kinds .    in our approach ,",
    "every measurement process is described by the dynamical coupling between the quantum open system and the apparatus .",
    "the postulation of wave function collapse is not used . to describe the repeated measurements",
    ", we use a multi - apparatus model that in each measurement , the open system interacts with an individual apparatus @xcite , while all the other apparatus are left alone . as proved in sec .",
    "ii , regarding to the evolution of the density operator of the quantum open system , this multi - apparatus model of repeated measurements is equivalent with the intuitive model where all the measurements are given by the same apparatus and the state of this apparatus is initialized before each measurement .",
    "we also point out , in our model there is no special restriction on the details of the measurement process , e.g. , the coupling between the to - be - measured system and the heat bath .",
    "to be more practical , we concentrate on the case of  repeated measurements , \" i.e. , the duration time of each measurement is much smaller than the time interval between two measurements .    using the multi - apparatus dynamical model of repeated measurements , we completely investigate the effect of the measurements on both the short - time and long - time evolution of the tls , and derive the qze and qaze in various cases . for the short - time evolution , with time - dependent perturbation theory ,",
    "we obtain the short - time decay rate of the excited state of the tls , and show that when the tls is under repeated ideal projective measurements , the short - time decay rate given by our dynamical model is exactly same as the one from the wave packet collapse postulation @xcite . in the case of imperfect measurements ,",
    "the corrections due to the non - ideality and the finite duration time of the measurements can also be naturally obtained .",
    "we prove that in the case of non - ideal measurements , qze also occurs when the measurements are frequent enough .",
    "for the long - time evolution of the tls , we derive the rate equation of the tls by calculating the complete long - time evolution of the tls and the environment , rather than by resetting the state of the environment after each measurement .",
    "since the markovian approximation is not applied , our rate equation can be used for the cases of heat baths with arbitrary correlation time and the cases of measurements repeated with arbitrary frequency .",
    "the rate equation clearly shows that the spectrum of the noise is effectively tuned by the repeated measurements .",
    "especially , we show that when the measurements are frequent enough , the time - local approximation and coarse - grained approximation will be applicable . in this case , at zero temperature , the decay rate given by the long - time rate equation is the same as the short - time decay rate from our short - time perturbative calculation in sec .",
    "iv . furthermore , as a result of the counter - rotating terms in the coupling hamiltonian of the tls and the heat both",
    ", the decay rate of the ground state of the tls may be varied to a non - zero value by the periodic measurements , even at zero temperature .",
    "our model is also able to describe the qze or qaze given by periodic phase modulation pulses  phasem1,phasem2,phasem3 rather than measurements , since the former one can be considered as a special kind of non - ideal measurement with complex decoherence factor .",
    "our calculation also provides a microscopic or full - quantum theory for the recent proposals of stochastic control of quantum coherence  control1,control2,control3 , where the repeated projective measurements are semi - classically described as a stochastic term in the hamiltonian .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we post our multi - apparatus dynamical model for the repeated quantum non - demolition measurements . in sec .",
    "iii we show our dynamical description for the dissipative tls under repeated measurements . in sec .",
    "iv we calculate the short - time decay rate of the excited state of the tls via time - dependent perturbation theory , and discuss the effects given by non - ideal measurements or phase modulation pulses to qze and qaze . in sec .",
    "v we consider the long - time evolution of the system , derive the effective noise spectrum experienced by the tls and obtain the rate equation for the long - time evolution at finite temperature .",
    "there are some conclusions and discussions in sec .",
    "before every measurement the state of @xmath0 is initialized to a given state @xmath1.,width=340 ]    in this paper , we discuss the quantum evolution of a dissipative tls under repeated quantum non - demolition measurements .",
    "there are two possible models to describe the repeated quantum measurements , i.e. , the single - apparatus model and the multi - apparatus model . in the single - apparatus model , all the measurements are completed via the same apparatus whose state is  initialized \" to a special one in the beginning of each measurement . in the multi - apparatus model ,",
    "each measurement is achieved by an individual apparatus @xcite .",
    "namely , in every measurement , only one apparatus interacts with the to - be - measured system while all the others are left alone . in the recent experimental realization of qze in cavity qed expcqed , in every measurement",
    "the state of the cavity field is measured by an individual ensemble of cold atoms .",
    "it can be considered as an illustration of the multi - apparatus model .    in the current section ,",
    "we prove that , regarding to the evolution of the to - be - measured system ( in our case , it is the tls together with the heat bath ) , the two models are equivalent .",
    "they can lead to the same evolution of the density matrix of the to - be - measured system . for the convenience of our calculation , in this paper we will use the multi - apparatus model in our discussion for qze and qaze from the next section .    in the following",
    "we will first show the dynamical model of a single quantum non - demolition measurement , and then do the formal calculation for the evolution of the to - be - measured system under repeated measurements with single - apparatus and multi - apparatus model .",
    "our result shows that the density matrix of the to - be - measured system has the same time evolution in both models . for the generality of our discussion , in this section",
    "the to - be - measured system is assumed to be a general multi - level quantum system . from next section",
    "we will focus on the system of tls together with the heat bath .      according to the dynamical theory of quantum non - demolition measurements  @xcite ,",
    "the measurement process can be described by the coupling between the to - be - measured system @xmath2  and the apparatus @xmath0 .",

    "<S> the correction to the ideal decay rate is also obtained under the non - ideal measurements . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we find that the quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects are possibly _ enhanced _ by the non - ideal natures of measurements . for the open system under measurements with arbitrary period , we generally derive the rate equation for the long - time evolution for the cases with _ arbitrary _ temperature and noise spectrum , and show that in the long - time evolution the noise spectrum is effectively tuned by the repeated measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is also able to describe the quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects given by the phase modulation pulses , as well as the relevant quantum control schemes . </S>"
