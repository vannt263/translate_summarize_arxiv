    "a key structural question keeps pending on the foundations of particle physics and of fundamental physics in general : is the weak scale natural ? the results of the first lhc phase , as partly already hinted by previous experiments as well@xcite , have shown that the proposed positive answers to this question do not work in the way they were originally thought . to keep the weak scale and the related higgs boson mass where they are @xcite , some apparently accidental relations between different parameters of the proposed extensions of the standard model ( sm ) have to be invoked , at least at the level of @xmath0 .    at a fundamental level a fine tuning of @xmath0 to make the weak scale totally insensitive to what happens at shorter distances , whatever they are , even the planck scale ,",
    "does not look as a serious problem , also because fine tunings of this sort are plentiful in nature .",
    "rather the serious problem is of practical nature . while in absence of fine tunings we would have known for sure where and how the signs of new physics should have been seen",
    "- and they have not - , this is no longer the case in the present situation .",
    "confronted with it , several different attitudes can be and are being taken . without entering the discussion of pros and contras for any such attitude , here",
    "we take the view that it will be in any case crucial for the entire field to push as high as possible the sensitivity to the signs of  quasi - natural \" theories of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , as they may now be called .",
    "an obvious immediate consequence is that the search for the production of new particles , as expected in such theories , is a highly motivated primary goal of the next lhc phase . given the previous recent experience , there are in fact good reasons to think that these searches will be well in place .",
    "the exploration of most part of the sensitive region of parameter space is actually likely to take place in the relatively early stage of the new lhc phase .",
    "another thing can be said quite firmly : the lack of signals so far makes it implausible that the lhc will be able to explore the full features expected in motivated extensions of the sm , if they are indeed realized .",
    "here we are concerned with the information that might come from indirect searches of new physics ( np ) in precision measurements .",
    "such measurements could play a leading role in a sufficiently long period of time , after a relatively early stage of the new lhc phase , whatever its findings will be , and before the advent of a needed higher energy hadron collider .",
    "specifically we have in mind the measurements of the higgs boson couplings at the lhc and the improvements in the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) that could be done at a new z factory , like at an ilc or at tlep . a different opportunity is offered by flavour physics experiments but it will not concern us here .",
    "there is no general statement that can be made about the relative importance of higgs coupling measurements and ewpt , since it depends upon the models ( or the category of models ) under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "we find it useful to try to have a sufficiently broad view of the possible outcomes . to this end",
    "we consider three examples in precisely defined regimes , so as to make possible correspondingly precise statements :    * a  composite \" higgs boson from a semi - strong @xmath1 @xmath2-model @xcite , linearly realized ; * the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with all s - partners heavy enough that their presence , real or virtual , does not influence the precision observables in a significant way ; * the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) with s - partners equally decoupled together with the extra scalar doublet orthogonal to the observed states ( the goldstone or the higgs bosons ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "our approach is complementary to already existing studies based on effective lagrangians @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "also in view of the current bounds , these models provide a significant representation of quasi - natural models of ewsb , even though different specific realizations are possible , that can give rise to different features .",
    "the early results of the lhc in its second phase might clearly point to i ) or ii)/ iii ) , perhaps with some needed integration , or could keep them all as open possibilities .",
    "the model we consider is defined by the lagrangian@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a five - plet of real scalar fields , @xmath5 is the covariant derivative with respect to the sm gauge group and @xmath6 is a potential that breaks explicitly the @xmath7 symmetry of the @xmath8-dependent term down to @xmath9 . under this @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is quartet , or",

    "is replaced by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the decay constant of the ( pseudo)-goldstone boson field @xmath11 . here",
    "we keep a finite coupling @xmath8 to increase the calculability of the model .    with a specific choice of the potential @xmath16 , e.g.@xcite @xmath17",
    "one can compute the vacuum expectation values of @xmath11 and @xmath13 @xmath18 as well as the mass and composition of the two physical scalars in @xmath4 .",
    "let us define @xmath19 so that , when @xmath20 , then @xmath21 to recover the non - linear @xmath2-model description .",
    "let us also define the mass eigenstates ( @xmath22 ) by @xmath23 where we maintain the same notation @xmath11 for its only physical component .",
    "if one insists that the parameters of the breaking potential , @xmath24 , remain limited as @xmath8 grows , the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be traded for the more physical parameters @xmath27 and the masses @xmath28 , @xmath29 in a unique way , e.g. @xmath30 in this way the mixing angle is also uniquely determined by @xmath31 where we define as customary @xmath32 for large @xmath33 we have @xmath34 had we considered a different @xmath7-breaking potential than ( [ pot5 ] ) , e.g. @xmath35@xcite , we would have obtained a similar expression except for a factor of 2 in front of the @xmath36 correction . ) can be viewed as the linearized version of the minimal composite higgs model mchm@xmath37 @xcite with sm fermions coupled linearly to composite fields in the fundamental or antisymmetric representation of @xmath7 , whereas @xmath35 represents the linearized version of mchm@xmath38 @xcite with composite fermions in the spinorial representation . ]    in a true strongly interacting scenario , one expects the presence of many other resonances . here",
    "we focus just on the @xmath2 particle , because , despite its simplicity , this model provides the leading contributions to the observables we are interested in , as we are now going to discuss .",
    "the mixing angle ( [ s2teta ] ) is the main parameter that determines both the modified higgs couplings to the gauge bosons , @xmath39 , as well as the corrections to the @xmath40-parameters of the ewpt @xcite . for the higgs couplings , normalized to the sm one has , limit , scattering amplitudes sensitive to the couplings in eq .",

    "the reason to consider first the nmssm than the mssm is its formal connection with the model discussed in the previous section : in the limit where the extra scalar doublet orthogonal to the observed states ( the goldstone and the higgs bosons ) is also decoupled , the two residual physical scalars are again an admixture of an @xmath66 doublet @xmath67 and a real singlet @xmath68 .",

    "this is particularly the case for the measurements of the higgs couplings which will always be able to explore a significant portion of the different parameter spaces . on the contrary",
    "the role of precision measurements of the ew observables , even pushed at a dedicated z - factory , appears limited to the case of a",

    "composite \" resonances , represented in the linear model by the @xmath2-particle . in spite of the crudeness of the model , adopted for its calculability , the relation of the scale @xmath15 with the strength of the linear higgs couplings to the vectors is not subject to significant model - dependent corrections@xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] , could end up being consistent with the sm value .",
    "as in the linear @xmath2-model also the nmssm can show a mixing of the higgs boson with an @xmath66-singlet scalar , with two important , although formal , differences .",
    "one is that the mixing is controlled by the single heavier scale , i.e. the mass of the extra scalar .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ sin ] ) ) .",
    "the other difference is that this same mixing suppresses all the couplings of the higgs boson to the vectors and to the fermions in the same way .",
    "these differences are at the origin of the relatively weaker explorative power in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , by the precision measurements .",
    "an absolute measurement of the invisible higgs width would be the key here , as possible at an @xmath64 collider@xcite .",
    "another possibility is offered by the measurements of the triple higgs coupling , with conceivable deviations of relative order unity from the sm@xcite , against a @xmath127 @xmath128 accuracy foreseen at hi - lhc .",
    "the third case that we have examined is the mssm with s - particles sufficiently heavy that their virtual exchange does not influence the precision measurements and with the extra scalars , although heavier than the observed higgs state , that could be the lightest new particles around . in this case",
    "the key features that makes powerful the measurements of the higgs couplings are : i ) their distortion by the mixing between @xmath96 and @xmath98 , different for vectors , the top quark or the bottom/@xmath129 ; ii ) the dependence of the mixing angle @xmath105 on @xmath130 and @xmath131 given in eq .   and shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .    given the configuration of the models that we are considering , the competitor of the precision measurements is the direct search for extra scalars , be they new higgs particles or some strongly interacting new states .",
    "this is manifest , for example , in fig.s  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , where exclusion regions due to direct heavy higgs searches are already present .",
    "it would be interesting to know as reliably as possible the future sensitivity of the lhc , including the high luminosity phase , in the parameter spaces at least of the mssm and the nmssm , i.e. in the planes of fig.s  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , where in fact the properties of the extra scalars are precisely defined .",
    "it appears , however , that the precision measurements will anyhow play an important complementary role .",
