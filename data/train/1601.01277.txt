    "a normally applied electrical field induces a stagger potential and causes a band gap,@xcite which is essential for the application .",
    "the buckling dramatically increases the spin - orbit coupling ( soc),@xcite while it is too weak to induce observable effect in graphene.@xcite the soc in a honeycomb lattice material makes it a topologic insulator and spin helical edge states exist in the edges.@xcite the combination of the stagger potential and the soc results in valley polarization,@xcite and various spin and valley related physics can be found in junction systems.@xcite recently , researchers successfully fabricated line defects in honeycomb lattices,@xcite which has spurred lots of discussions on their electronic properties .",

    "the quantum states around the line defect can be described by the low energy continuum model with a proper wave connection condition.@xcite a efficient valley filter effect can be caused by multiple defect lines due to the valley - dependent resonance.@xcite the studies on the defect line are all based on graphene lattice , in which no soc needed to be considered .",

    "the spin - up defect edge states propagate along one defect edge and run back along the other defect edge , and the spin - down ones behave reversely , i.e. , they are spin helical states .",

    "we study the spin - flipped transport when the lattice is subjected by random distribution of spin - flipped impurities .",
    "there always exist an energy interval within the bulk gap , in which the spin - flipped transmission is much smaller than that of the bulk electrons .",

    "the dispersion is shown as fig .",
    "[ device ] ( b ) .",
    "it can be seen that the dispersion is quite similar to that of a graphene ribbon , except that there are two additional curves lacking of electron - hole symmetry .",

    "if we choose another point on the flat band apart from point @xmath6 ( a point between @xmath6 and @xmath27 ) to study , we find the density decays away from the defect edge atoms to the bulk of either side , and the decay rate depends on the deviation of the point studied from point @xmath6 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "these features are just those of edge states for a zigzag graphene ribbon , which is not strange because the defect edge atoms are just the real edge ones if the defect atoms are removed . for this reason , we call these defect - nearest atoms as defect edge ones . the electron density of point @xmath7 on curve-2 is shown in fig . 1 ( d ) .",
    "the density is most localized on the defect atoms and slightly scattered on nearby atoms . for other points on the same curve near point @xmath7",

    "the density distributions of the two bands are symmetric with respect to the defect line .    to describe the localization on the defect atoms , we define quantity @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the probability distribution .",

    "@xmath8 of curve-2 experiences one more abrupt change because there is an additional crossing at point @xmath28 besides of the crossing at point @xmath27 ; part @xmath33 of it is almost overlap with @xmath8 curve for curve-1 since they have similar localization properties ; for part @xmath35 , @xmath8 is zero , which reflects the properties of the bulk states and the electron probability on the defect atoms is infinitesimal ; and from @xmath27 to @xmath7 , the density on defect atoms is continuously increased .",

    "the system is spin - dependent , we only study the properties for the spin - up electrons for now , and discuss spin - down electrons later .",
    "the soc induces a gap @xmath39 at each valley for a perfect bulk silicene - like lattice , which depends on the soc by @xmath40 the small gap can be found between curve-1 and curve-2 near valley @xmath41 in fig . 2 ( a ) , and it causes slightly smearing of the abrupt changes of @xmath8 versus @xmath4 for both curve-1 and curve-2 , as illustrated in fig . 2 ( f ) .",
    "when we increase the soc amplitude , the gap at valley @xmath41 increases correspondingly , the smearing of @xmath8 is more apparently , the defect states around point @xmath27 on curve-1 and the bulk states around the point on curve-2 are mixed with each other , and the @xmath42 part disappears .",
    "the bulk gap at valley @xmath41 or @xmath43 is not the real gap between curve-1 and curve-2 , because the bottom of curve-1 remains almost unchanged at @xmath44 when @xmath22 changes .    in the energy gap ,",
    "the soc drives spin - up electrons piled up at one edge if edges exist , and spin - down electrons at the other edge .",
    "because the defect line can be regarded as another type of edge , we expect electrons with different spins accumulate near different defect edges even no real edge exist ( periodic edge condition in @xmath1-direction is adopted , so no real edge exists ) and the electron probability distribution exhibits asymmetry with respect to the defect line . to describe the asymmetry , we define the quantity @xmath45 figure 2 ( k ) shows @xmath46 of curve-1 and curve-2 as functions of @xmath4 .",
    "a small soc can induces a remarkable asymmetry of @xmath46 ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) near valley @xmath41 , and a larger soc @xmath48 results in the asymmetry of the whole interval of @xmath4 . around valley @xmath41 the electron probability corresponding to curve-1",
    "is localized near the upper defect edge ( @xmath49 ) and near the lower defect edge ( @xmath50 ) around the other valley , and for the curve-2 situation is reversed .",
    "next we switch on the stagger potential amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "the combination of the stagger potential and soc term causes two different energy gaps , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for valleys @xmath41 and @xmath43 for a perfect silicene - like lattice , respectively , which is called as valley polarization effect and only happens for @xmath53 .",
    "the two gaps are determined by @xmath54 for small stagger potential @xmath55 , the gap of valley @xmath41 shrinks and that of valley @xmath43 enlarges , which makes the bulk dispersions around valleys @xmath41 and @xmath43 not identical , breaks the left - right symmetry of @xmath8 , and spoils the anti - left - right symmetry of @xmath46 , as illustrated in fig . 2 ( c ) , ( h ) , and ( m ) . when @xmath21 is increased to @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 , saying , the gap of valley @xmath41 vanishes and the crossing between curve-1 and curve-2 returns .",
    "the abrupt change of @xmath8 at the crossing point is revivified .",
    "the asymmetry of the electron probability around valley @xmath41 is almost unobservable while remains apparent around valley @xmath43 .",
    "these features can be seen in fig . 2 ( d ) , ( i ) , and ( n ) . when we increase @xmath21 so as to @xmath58 , we have two nonidentical gaps for two different valleys again . fig .",
    "2 ( e ) , ( j ) , and ( o ) show the dispersion , @xmath8 , and @xmath46 for this case .",
    "the bulk dispersion and the @xmath8 curve are quite similar to those for the case of @xmath59 , but the bottom of curve-1 is above @xmath44 and no more @xmath42 point can be found on the curve of @xmath8 for curve-1 . in the whole interval of @xmath4 , @xmath50 for curve-1 , which is very different from the case @xmath60 .",
    "if we only consider the spin - down electrons , all the curves appearing in fig . 2 are flipped left - to - right with these symmetric curves keep intact .",
    "fig 3 ( a ) shows the energy dispersions for both spin - up and spin - down for @xmath61 and @xmath30 .",
    "the curves for spin - up and spin - down overlap completely , but the probability distribution for the two defect edge bands are different .",
    "we study the states represented by four points at the same energy , say , points @xmath7 and @xmath27 on curve-1 for spin - up and @xmath28 and @xmath29 for spin - down .",
    "the probability distribution corresponding to the four point is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) through ( e ) . at the energy ,",
    "the spin - up electrons go right along the lower defect edge and flow left along the upper defect edge , in other words , run anti - clockwise around the defect line , while the spin - up electrons go clockwise .    ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 in ( a ) , respectively.,width=264 ]    when both soc and stagger potential are present , the energy dispersions for spin - up and spin - down electrons are not identical , as shown in fig 4 ( a ) .",
    "the probability distribution of four point @xmath7 through @xmath29 labeled in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "( b ) through ( e ) . at the energy represented by the horizontal line , electrons with both spins move along the lower defect edge leaving the upper defect edge almost empty .",
    "this can be understood by that atoms belong to different defect edges are buckled reversely and a electric field across the defect line . because @xmath62 is adopted in the figure , the electric field is dominate and drives the electron probability on one side of the defect line .",
    "the spacial separation of the electrons with different spins is helpful for the suppression of spin flip when electrons propagating . a small bias along the defect line drives electrons from the left going to the right .",
    "if the electron is injected at the energy within the bulk energy gap and above the bottom of curve-1 , the transport is supported by the defect edge states .",
    "when no stagger potential is applied , the spin - up and spin - down electrons flow rightward alone the lower and upper defect edges , respectively ( see fig .",
    "we consider there are some spin - flipping scatterers random distributed on the plane , and the scatterers are assumed to be sufficiently weak , microscopically large but macroscopically small , and identical with each other .",
    "the electrons can not be scattered back because back scattering needs large @xmath4 transfer , but the spin can be flipped without change of @xmath4 . this type of scatterers can be regarded as a simple model of the local lattice distortion induced by alien atom absorption.@xcite the local distortion , for example , a bump , leads to spin - dependent scattering and is relaxed within the area of the dimension of tens of lattice constant.@xcite besides the lattice distortion , the on - site energy of the alien atom is a short - ranged scatterer , which is spin - independent and not our aim . in frame of first order perturbation theory , the spin - flipped transmission ( the detailed derivation is given in the appendix ) is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is density of states at energy @xmath29 , @xmath65 is the velocity ( @xmath66 is adopted ) , and @xmath67 is the overlap of lateral eigen states of the spin - up and spin - down electrons , and @xmath68 is a parameter to characterize 2d disorder with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 being the number , area , and potential of scatterer and @xmath72 the area of the sample . for the bulk electrons going parallel to the @xmath0-direction , the spin - flipped transmission is described by the same equation .",
    "the dispersion relation of bulk electrons is @xmath73 , so we have the velocity square is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the fermi velocity of perfect silicene , and @xmath76 for bulk electrons . figure [ figt ]",
    "shows the spin - flipped transmission as a function of energy for both the defect line guided transport and @xmath0-direction propagation for bulk electrons . above the gap , the flipped transmission decreases with increasing energy and tends to a stabilized value because @xmath77 when @xmath78 .",
    "however , within the bulk gap , there exists an interval in which the spin - flipped transmission is smaller than that for the bulk state , this is because @xmath13 vanishes at some wavevectors near valleys @xmath41 and @xmath43 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figt ] , and thus @xmath79 occurs a certain energy .    the spin - flipped feature of the line defect results in interesting spin transport effects .",
    "if we tune the system that the fermi energy is aligned at the flip - free point , the line defect works as an ideal spin guide ; when we place a top gate ( the gate length along the line defect must be limited within the coherence length ) to push the fermi energy away from the flip - free point , we have the out - coming electrons with the spin being a superposition of spin - up and spin - down , and the weights of different spins depends on the length and potential of the gate . a precision prediction of the weights beyond the first order perturbation , but the qualitative physics can be expected as that .    to our knowledge",
    ", silicene can now only be grown on metal surfaces,@xcite which is an obstacle to perform transport measurement , and long and regular defect line in silicene has not being reported experimentally yet .",
