    "determination of the static quark - antiquark ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) potential has been one of most vital subjects of the lattice qcd simulation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the status of the three quark ( 3@xmath4 ) potential is much less settled , in spite of its importance in the baryon spectroscopy . in this paper , we present our recent result of lattice calculation of the static three quark potential @xcite .    it has been widely used the static @xmath4-@xmath5 potential expressed as the sum of the short range coulomb term and long range confining linear term . in the case of the 3@xmath4 potential , two distinct treatments of the linear term are frequently applied . in this paper",
    "they are denoted as `` @xmath1-type '' and `` @xmath0-type '' forms .",
    "the former expresses the linear potential as the sum of two - body potentials , which are proportional to the distance between each pair of quarks .",
    "the latter treats the potential with the string linking three quarks at the point with which the total length of the string takes the minimum length , @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath0-type ansatz has been used in the phenomenological studies with the string tension @xmath7 , and successfully describes the gross feature of the baryon spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-type ansatz is , however , also used in some model calculations with the string tension @xmath8 effectively around half of @xmath2 .",
    "the lattice simulations have been done mainly in 1980 s @xcite , and there is one recent preliminary work @xcite . among them , several authors interpreted their results as the support of the @xmath1-type picture @xcite .",
    "this embarrassing situation is mainly caused by the insufficient extraction of the ground state contribution from the baryonic wilson loop . in nineties ,",
    "calculation of @xmath4-@xmath5 potential became much reliable by making use of the smearing technique which enhances the ground state contribution to the wilson loop @xcite .",
    "this procedure is directly applicable to the three quark system , and is expected to enable us reliable extraction of the ground state contribution .",
    "our first goal of this work is an extraction of reliable static 3@xmath4 potential using the smearing technique . with the lattice result",
    ", we discuss preferable description of the potential .",
    "these subjects are described in the next section .",
    "another important subject on the 3@xmath4 potential is the thermal effect on it at finite temperature . again the lattice computation is much retarded compared with the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential .",
    "we present our preliminary result at @xmath9 in section 3 .",
    "the three quark potential is extracted from the baryonic wilson loop , @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the path - ordered product along the path @xmath13 ( @xmath141 , 2 , 3 ) as shown in figure  [ fig : bloop ] .",
    "the position of the contraction of three lines @xmath15 can be chosen arbitrarily , and the result should not depend on this point .",
    "we choose the contracting point as the spatial origin , and locate three static quarks on each three spatial axis .",
    "the same constellation is averaged making use of the translational invariance .",
    "the numerical simulation is done on the lattice of size @xmath16 , with the standard wilson gauge action at @xmath17 in the quenched approximation .",
    "the lattice spacing is determined as @xmath18 fm by setting the string tension of @xmath4-@xmath5 potential to be @xmath19 gev / fm .",
    "the ( baryonic ) wilson loop is measured on 210 configurations with applying the smearing technique to enhance the ground state contribution .",
    "the potentials are extracted from the ( baryonic ) wilson loop by the single exponential fit in appropriate fit regions , where the wilson loop is dominated by the ground state contribution @xcite .",
    "let us start with the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential .",
    "it is widely accepted that the lattice result of the static @xmath4-@xmath5 potential is well described by the form @xmath20 in table  [ tab : fit ] , we list the results of the fit in three kinds of fit ranges : on - axis fit , fits with off - axis data in the whole @xmath21 region and at @xmath22 .",
    "since our lattice spacing is rather coarse , the fit with the off - axis data may suffer from the rotational symmetry breaking effect . in this sense , the fit with the on - axis data is preferable to determine the parameters .",
    "for the 3@xmath4 potential , however , we inevitably treat the off - axis constellations , and then it would be meaningful to examine the typical size of the rotational symmetry breaking effect in the @xmath4-@xmath5 system . for this purpose ,",
    "we carry out the fit including the off - axis data with two fit ranges .",
    "the fit using all data ( all @xmath21 in table  [ tab : fit ] ) results in large @xmath23 value , and this is mainly caused by the result at the short distance region where the statistical error is smallest and the cutoff effect is most severe .",
    "we alternatively fit at @xmath22 , which is more appropriate for comparison with the result of the 3@xmath4 potential . in this case the fit results in @xmath24 , and we regard this value as a guide of the rotational symmetry breaking effect on this lattice . in both cases ,",
    "the fit result of the coulomb coefficient much differs from the value of on - axis fit than the case of the string tension .",
    "figure  [ fig : pot2 ] shows the lattice result of the 3@xmath4 potential from the viewpoint of the @xmath0-type ansatz . the horizontal axis , @xmath6 , is the minimum length of the flux lines linking three quarks . three flux connecting the junction with quarks take the angles @xmath25 , which balances three forces with equal strength , in the case that all three angles of the `` quark triangle '' are less than @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the data are fitted to the form @xmath26 the result is listed in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "this form of the potential well describes the observed result , and the string tension is almost same as in the case of @xmath4-@xmath5 potential .",
    "the @xmath23 of the fit is in the same order as in @xmath4-@xmath5 with fit range @xmath22 .",
    "considering the rotational symmetry violation effect at this @xmath27 , this seems to be a consistent result .",
    "alternative ansatz , @xmath1-type , is represented with the fitting function @xmath28 and the obtained parameters are also listed in table  [ tab : fit ] . as the result of fit , we find that the string tension is much smaller than the @xmath0-type fit , although the constant and the coefficient of the coulomb term are almost the same as the @xmath0-type results . in the fit , @xmath8 is slightly larger than the half of @xmath29 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath30 roughly holds in most cases .",
    "this explains that @xmath31 . there is another possible physical explanation for @xmath32 using the @xmath33 casimir scaling . for the coulomb coefficient",
    ", one gluon exchange brings the color factor @xmath34 in the perturbation theory as the ratio of the @xmath33 casimir factor .",
    "the linear term is however nonperturbative and then there is no clear explanation to keep the @xmath33 casimir scaling beyond the perturbation .",
    "in addition , the @xmath23 of the @xmath1-type fit is much larger than the case of the @xmath0-type fit , where the goodness of the fit is comparable with @xmath4-@xmath5 potential case with @xmath22 .",
    "although the present simulation may suffer from rather large finite @xmath35 effect , our result shows that the @xmath0-type ansatz is more preferable with the lattice data .",
    ".fit results of the @xmath4-@xmath5 and the 3@xmath4 potentials . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our conclusion at this stage is the following .",
    "@xmath0-type ansatz is more preferable for the lattice result although @xmath1-type ansatz is not completely excluded with present systematic uncertainty .",
    "adopting @xmath0-type picture , we have found a universal feature of the string tension as @xmath7 . to confirm this result and investigate the 3@xmath4 potential in more detail , simulations at larger @xmath27 s are in progress .",
    "preliminary result on the @xmath36 lattice at @xmath37 is consistent with the result at @xmath17 .",
    "now we turn on the temperature and observe how the potential changes with the thermal effect @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the static 3@xmath4 potential in the deconfined phase . above the critical temperature @xmath38",
    ", the quarks and the gluons are expected to be liberated and form a plasma state , in which the potential is expected to be screened .",
    "then one expects that the screened potential takes the yukawa potential like as the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential @xcite , and genuine three - body potential ( in @xmath0-type picture ) would disappear .    on the finite temperature lattice ,",
    "the static potential is extracted from the polyakov loop correlation , @xmath39 where the polyakov loop @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential is also measured in similar way .    to simulate the finite temperature system , we adopt the anisotropic lattice @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the anisotropic lattice for our study is that it enables us to work out several values of temperature without varying the lattice cutoff . as the gauge field action",
    ", we use the symanzik improved action at the tree level @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculation is done on the lattices of sizes @xmath42 at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in the quenched approximation . at @xmath45 , which is realized as the zero temperature lattice",
    ", we determine the renormalized anisotropy as @xmath46 from the wilson loops in the spatial - spatial and temporal - spatial planes .",
    "the static @xmath4-@xmath5 potential at @xmath47 gives the cutoffs @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 gev .",
    "the critical temperature is estimated by the rapid change of the polyakov loop and its susceptibility , and is found between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and slightly near to @xmath50 .",
    "for the investigation of the static potentials in the deconfined phase , we generate 60 configurations at @xmath52 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ft2 ] shows the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential and the 3@xmath4 potential in the deconfined phase . at the long distance , the polyakov loop correlators approach to the multiples of the expectation value of single polyakov loop : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these contributions are subtracted from the potentials .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential above @xmath38 is known to behave as the yukawa - type potential @xcite . in present calculation ,",
    "the debye screening mass of the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential strongly depends on the fit range and is estimated around 0.5  1 gev . at this @xmath56 , we have measured the 3@xmath4 potential with only equilateral constellations . in figure",
    "[ fig : ft2 ] , we show the 3@xmath4 potential divided by 3 , and find good agreement with the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential , @xmath57 above @xmath38 , since the quarks are deconfined , there is no reason to assume that the combination of quarks are in the color - singlet states .",
    "the question is whether the 3@xmath4 potential can be represented as the sum of two body potential .",
    "our present result shows that the @xmath58 behaves as almost same as the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential at least for the equilateral 3@xmath4 constellations . for more definite conclusion ,",
    "we need precise results including other 3@xmath4 constellations and a systematic comparison between @xmath59 and @xmath60 at various @xmath61 .",
