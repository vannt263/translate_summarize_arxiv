    "in a rare occurrence the spiral galaxy ic  5179 ( @xmath4=3,498 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) produced two supernovae ( sne ) in an interval of only three weeks .",
    "the first object ( sn  1999ee ) was a type ia event discovered by us 10 days before maximum @xcite .",
    "the early discovery motivated us to use the yalo and 0.9-m telescopes at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory in order to secure nightly @xmath1 photometric observations of this event , and the yalo and las campanas 1-m and 2.5-m telescopes to obtain @xmath7 photometry .",
    "although the second object ( sn  1999ex ) exploded three weeks later and was promptly present in our ccd images we did not notice its presence .",
    "its discovery had to await independent observations obtained at perth observatory @xcite .",
    "once sn  1999ex was reported to the iau circulars we initiated an optical and infrared ( ir ) spectroscopic followup using the european southern observatory ntt and danish 1.5-m telescope at la silla , and the vlt at cerro paranal .",
    "our spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn  1999ex constitute an unprecedented dataset which provides support to our understanding of the nature of core collapse sne . in this paper",
    "we show some of our observations and their interpretation . for a detailed report of our observations the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ hamuyf1.fig ] compares the near - maximum optical spectra of sn  1999ex to those of the prototype of the ib class sn  1984l @xcite , and the type ic sne  1994i @xcite and 1987 m @xcite .",
    "the first spectrum of sn  1999ex was characterized by a reddish continuum and several broad absorption / emission features due to ca ii h&k @xmath83934,3968 ,",
    "na i d @xmath85890,5896 , and the ca triplet with a clear p - cygni profile .",
    "this spectrum bore quite resemblance to that of the type ic sn  1994i @xcite .",
    "however , sn  1999ex showed evidence for he i absorptions ( shown with tick marks ) of moderate strength in the optical region , thus suggesting the existence of an intermediate ib / c case .",
    "our observations of sn  1999ex provide a clear link between the ib and ic classes and suggest that there is a continuous sequence of sne ib and ic objects .",
    "the presence of helium in the atmosphere of sn  1999ex can be further examined in our ir observations shown in fig .",
    "[ hamuyf2.fig ] .",
    "the strong feature near 1.05 @xmath9 m probably had a significant contribution from he i @xmath010830 , although it could be blended with lines of c  i and si  i @xcite .",
    "if this feature was he i @xmath010830 it would imply an expansion velocity of 6,000 - 8,000 km  s@xmath10 , which matches very well the velocities derived from the fe and na lines .",
    "this identification is supported by the presence of he i @xmath020581 with the same expansion velocity deduced from he i @xmath010830 .",
    "our ir spectra of sn  1999ex provide unambiguous proof that helium was present in the atmosphere of this intermediate ib / c object .",
    "a detailed atmosphere model could be very useful at placing specific limits on the helium mass in the ejecta of sn  1999ex and constraining the nature of its progenitor .",
    "evidently , @xmath11-band spectroscopy is probably the best tool to explore the presence or absence of helium in the atmospheres of sne  ib and ic .",
    "maximum is indicated for each spectrum ]     maximum is indicated for each spectrum ]    the question of whether or not sne  ic have helium is still controversial . a detailed inspection of the spectra of sn  1994i led filippenko et al .",
    "@xcite to conclude that weak he i lines were probably present in the optical region and that he i @xmath010830 was very prominent , although its doppler shift implied an unusually high expansion velocity @xmath1216,600 km  s@xmath10 as can be seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ hamuyf1.fig ] .",
    "clocchiatti et al .",
    "@xcite confirmed these observations and found evidence that he i @xmath05876 was also present in sn  1994i with a blueshift of @xmath1217,800 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "they also reported high velocity he i @xmath05876 in the spectra of the three best - observed type ic sne ( 1983v , 1987 m , and 1988l ) , which led them to conclude that most , and probably all , sne  ic have optical he i lines .",
    "this conclusion , however , was recently questioned by millard et al .",
    "@xcite and baron et al .",
    "@xcite by means of spectral synthesis models which showed that the 1.05 @xmath9 m feature could be accounted with lines of c i and si i. moreover , baron et al .",
    "@xcite argued that the feature attributed to he i @xmath05876 in the spectrum of sn  1994i could be a blend of other species .",
    "recently , matheson et al .",
    "@xcite compiled and analyzed a large collection of spectra of sne  ib and ic and did not find compelling evidence for helium in the spectra of sne  ic .",
    "evidently , there is no consensus yet about this issue .",
    "the existence of an intermediate ib / c object such as sn  1999ex suggests a continous transition between sne ib and sne  ic so it is likely that some sne  ic have some helium in their atmospheres .",

    "[ hamuyf3.fig ] shows the @xmath1 lightcurves of sn  1999ex .",
    "clearly the observations began well before maximum light thanks to our continuous followup of ic  5179 owing to the prior discovery of sn  1999ee .",
    "the first detection occurred on jd 2,451,481.6 in all filters .",
    "excellent seeing images obtained on the previous night allowed us to place reliable upper limits to the sn brightness , which permitted us to conclude that the explosion took place on jd 2,451,480.5 ( @xmath140.5 ) .",
    "along with the type ic hypernova 1998bw @xcite , these are the earliest observations of a sn  ib / c .",
    "the most remarkable feature in this figure is the early dip in the @xmath13 and @xmath15 lightcurves  covering the first 4 days of evolution  after which the sn steadily rose to maximum light .",
    "similar initial upturns have been observed before in sn  ic  1998bw @xcite , sn  ii  1987a @xcite , and sn  iib  1993j @xcite . for these sne  ii it",
    "is thought that the initial dip corresponded to a phase of adiabatic cooling that ensued the initial uv flash caused by shock emergence which super - heated and accelerated the photosphere .",
    "the following brightening is attributed to the energy deposited behind the photosphere by the radioactive decay of @xmath2ni@xmath3@xmath2co@xmath3@xmath2fe .",
    "this similarity suggests that the progenitor of sn  1999ex was a massive progenitor that underwent core collapse .",
    "woosley et al .",
    "@xcite computed type ib sn models consisting of the explosion of an evolved 6.2 m@xmath16 helium star .",
    "their figure 7 shows the bolometric luminosities of three models with different explosion energies and @xmath2ni nucleosynthesis , all of which show an initial peak followed by a dip a few days later and the subsequent brightening caused by @xmath2ni @xmath3 @xmath2co @xmath3 @xmath2fe , making them good models for sn  1999ex .      in order to compare the observations with the models we computed a bolometric lightcurve for sn  1999ex by performing blackbody ( bb ) fits to our @xmath19 photometry ( fig .",
    "[ hamuyf4.fig ] ) among the three sn  ib models of woosley et al .",
    ", the one with kinetic energy of 2.7@xmath2010@xmath21 ergs and 0.16 m@xmath16 of @xmath2ni provides the best match to sn  1999ex .",
    "the agreement is remarkable considering that we are not attempting to adjust the parameters .",
    "the initial peak and subsequent dip have approximately the right luminosities although the evolution of sn  1999ex was somewhat faster .",
    "the following evolution is well described by the model .",
    "the observation of the tail of the shock wave breakout in sn  1999ex and the initial dip in the lightcurve provides us with an insight on the type of progenitor system for sne  ib / c .",
    "several different models have been proposed as progenitors for this type of sne .",
    "one possibility is an accreting white dwarf which may explode via thermal detonation upon reaching the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "these models are expected to produce lightcurves with an initial peak that corresponds to the emergence of the burning front , a fast luminosity drop due to adiabatic expansion , and a subsequent rise caused by radioactive heating . given the compact nature of the progenitor ( @xmath121,800 km ) the cooling time scale by adiabatic expansion is only a few minutes @xcite and the lightcurve is entirely governed by radioactive heating @xcite . hence , these models are not expected to show an early dip at a few days past explosion as is observed in sn  1999ex .",
    "the second and more favored model for sne  ib / c consists of core collapse of massive stars ( @xmath22@xmath238 m@xmath24 ) which lose their outer h envelope before explosion . within the core collapse models ,",
    "there are two basic types of progenitor systems : 1 ) a massive ( @xmath22@xmath2335 m@xmath24 ) star which undergoes strong stellar winds and becomes a wolf - rayet star at the time of explosion @xcite , and 2 ) an exchanging binary system @xcite for less massive stars .",
    "the resulting sne have lightcurves containing an initial spike followed by a dip .",
    "since the initial radii of these progenitors are @xmath12100 times greater than that of white dwarfs , the dip occurs several days after explosion @xcite , very much like sn  1999ex .",
    "although a detailed modeling of sn  1999ex is beyond the scope of this paper , our fortuitous observations lend support to the idea that sne  ib / c are due to core collapse of massive progenitors rather than thermonuclear disruption of white dwarfs .",
