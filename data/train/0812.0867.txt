    "charge quantization , also known as _ coulomb blockade _ , has been observed in several different types of molecular heterojunctions,@xcite but has not yet been observed in bdt junctions due to the difficulty of gating such small molecules.@xcite the unambiguous observation of coulomb blockade in junctions involving larger molecules ( with _ smaller _ charging energies ) indicates that such interaction effects , lying outside the scope of mean - field approaches , are undoubtedly even more pronounced in small molecules like bdt .",
    "important aspects of this phenomenon remain to be understood in larger molecules , such as the anomalously low reported values of the charging energy.@xcite    a zero - bias cross section of the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fullcoulombdiamond ] reproduces the transmission spectrum shown in the top panel of the same figure . increasing the bias voltage , we find that the resonances split into negatively sloped particle - like ( @xmath162 ) lines and positively sloped hole - like ( @xmath163 ) lines , where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the mean lead - molecule capacitances , defined by @xmath166 , @xmath167 . in the symmetric coupling case ( @xmath168 with @xmath169 ) the lines therefore have slopes of -2 and + 2 for particle - like and hole - like lines , respectively . within the v - shaped outline traced by the particle - like and hole - like lines , we find signatures of resonant tunneling through electronic excited states in the many narrow , nearly parallel resonance lines .",
    "while transport through electronic excited states has not yet been unambiguously identified in single - molecule heterojunctions , it has been observed in quantum dots@xcite and carbon nanotubes.@xcite    an accurate description of the homo - lumo gap is essential for a quantitative theory of transport in molecular heterojunctions . the central homo - lumo gap shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullcoulombdiamond ] is significantly larger than that predicted@xcite by density functional theory  which neglects charge - quantization effects  but is consistent with previous many - body calculations in the sequential tunneling regime.@xcite it should be emphasized that the transport gap @xmath170 in a molecular junction exceeds the optical gap @xmath171 of an isolated molecule .",

    "in conclusion , we have developed a many - body theory of electron transport in single - molecule heterojunctions that treats coherent quantum effects and coulomb interactions on an equal footing .",
    "as a first application of our theory , we have investigated the thermoelectric power and differential conductance of a prototypical single - molecule junction , benzenedithiol with gold electrodes .",
    "our results reproduce the key features of both the coherent and coulomb blockade transport regimes : quantum interference effects , such as the transmission nodes predicted within mean - field theory,@xcite are confirmed , while the differential conductance spectrum exhibits characteristic charge quantization `` diamonds''@xcite  an effect outside the scope of mean - field approaches based on density - functional theory .",
    "the homo - lumo transport gap obtained is consistent with previous many - body treatments in the sequential tunneling limit.@xcite    the central object of the many - body theory is the coulomb self - energy @xmath0 of the junction , which may be expressed as @xmath176 , where @xmath71 is the result in the sequential tunneling limit , and @xmath76 is the correction due to a finite tunneling width @xmath2 . in this article , we have evaluated @xmath71 exactly , thereby including intramolecular correlations at a nonperturbative level , while the direct and exchange contributions to @xmath76 were evaluated self - consistently using a conserving approximation based on diagrammatic perturbation theory on the keldysh contour .",
    "an important feature of our theory is that this approximation for @xmath76 can be systematically improved by including additional processes diagrammatically . in this way ,",
    "important effects such as dynamical screening , spin - flip scattering,@xcite and electron - phonon coupling@xcite can be included as natural extensions of the theory .    our general theory of molecular junction transport should be contrasted to results for transport in the anderson model.@xcite the anderson model provides important insight into nonperturbative interaction effects in quantum transport through nanostructures ; however , the internal structure of the molecule is neglected . moreover , since it is limited to a single spin - degenerate level , it can only describe a single coulomb diamond with an odd number of electrons on the molecule , and is therefore not applicable to transport within the homo - lumo gap of conjugated organic molecules , where the number of electrons is even ( more precisely , the homo - lumo gap is taken to be infinite in the anderson model ) .",
    "recently , a negf approach for molecular junction transport was introduced @xcite using green s functions that are matrices in a basis of many - body molecular eigenstate outer products @xmath177 ; it is unclear what relation this approach has to the approach proposed herein involving _ single - particle green s functions _ , which are matrices in the atomic orbital basis ."
