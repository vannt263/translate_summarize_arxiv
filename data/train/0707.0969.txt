    "the three - terminal relay channel was introduced by van der meulen @xcite and was initially studied primarily in the context of multiuser information theory @xcite . in recent years , relaying has emerged as a powerful technique to improve the reliability and throughput of wireless networks .",
    "an understanding of wireless relay channels has thus become an important area of research .",
    "wireless relay channels and networks have been addressed from various aspects , including information - theoretic capacity @xcite , diversity @xcite , outage performance @xcite , and cooperative coding @xcite .",
    "central to the study of wireless relay channels is the problem of resource allocation .",
    "for example , the source and relay nodes can dynamically allocate their transmit powers to achieve a better rate if the fading state information is available .",
    "resource allocation for relay channels and networks has been studied by several recent papers , including @xcite .",
    "common to all of these studies is the assumption that the source and relay nodes are subject to a total power constraint .    in this paper , we study wireless fading relay channels , where we assume that the source and relay nodes are subject to separate power constraints instead of a total power constraint .",
    "this assumption is more practical for wireless networks , because the source and relay nodes are usually geographically separated , and are hence supported by separate power supplies . under this assumption ,",
    "the resource allocation problem falls under a class of _ max - min _ problems .",
    "we connect such _ max - min _ problems to the _ minimax _ two hypothesis testing problem ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.c ) ) , and apply a similar technique to find optimal ( in the _ max - min _ sense ) resource allocation strategies for fading relay channels .",
    "we first study the parallel relay channel , which consists of multiple independent relay channels and serves as a basic information - theoretic model for fading relay channels .",
    "we derive a lower bound on the capacity based on the partial decode - and - forward scheme as well as a cut - set upper bound .",
    "we show that the two bounds match and establish the capacity for the parallel relay channel with degraded subchannels .",
    "this generalizes the capacity result in ( * ? ?",
    "12 ) to multiple subchannels .",
    "we also demonstrate that the parallel relay channel is not a simple combination of subchannels in that the capacity of the parallel relay channel can be larger than the sum of the capacities of subchannels , as was also remarked in ( * ? ? ?",
    "we then study the gaussian parallel relay channel with degraded subchannels .",
    "there are two types of capacity that can be defined for this channel .",
    "the first is the synchronized capacity , where the source and relay inputs are allowed to be correlated . to achieve the capacity , the source and relay nodes need to choose an optimal correlation parameter for each subchannel , and further to choose an optimal power allocation across the subchannels under separate power constraints .",
    "we characterize the optimal solutions for the cases where the optimization is convex , and provide equations that need to be solved numerically for cases where the optimization is nonconvex .",
    "we also study the asynchronized capacity , where the source and relay inputs are required to be independent .",
    "this capacity is easier to achieve in practice due to the simpler transceiver design for the source and relay nodes .",
    "we fully characterize the capacity - achieving power allocation at the source and relay nodes in closed form .",
    "we then move on to study the fading relay channel , which is based on the classical relay channel with each transmission link being corrupted by a multiplicative stationary and ergodic fading process as well as an additive white gaussian noise process .",
    "the fading relay channel is a special case of the parallel relay channel , with each subchannel corresponding to one fading state realization .",
    "we assume that both the transmitter and the receiver know the channel state information , so that the source and relay nodes can allocate their transmission powers adaptively according to the instantaneous fading state information .",
    "we consider the resource allocation problem for two fading relay models : full - duplex and half - duplex .",
    "the fading full - duplex relay channel has been studied in @xcite , where lower and upper bounds on the capacity were derived , along with the resource allocation that optimizes these bounds , under a total power constraint for the source and relay nodes . in this paper , we assume separate power constraints for the source and relay nodes and study the power allocation that optimizes the capacity bounds .",
    "we focus on the more practical asynchronized case .",
    "we obtain the power allocation that maximizes an achievable rate , and show that the optimal power allocation may be _ two - level water - filling _ , _ orthogonal division water - filling _ , or _",
    "iterative water - filling _ depending on the channel statistics and the power constraints .",
    "we also establish the asynchronized capacity for channels that satisfy a certain condition .    we further study a fading half - duplex relay channel model , where the source node transmits to the relay and destination nodes in one channel , and the relay node transmits to the destination node in an orthogonal channel .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath0 to represent the channel resource ( time and bandwidth ) allocation between the two orthogonal channels .",
    "we study three scenarios . in scenario",
    "i , where the two orthogonal channels share the channel resource equally , i.e. , @xmath1 , we show that the optimal power allocation falls into three cases depending on the ranges of power constraints at the source and relay nodes .",
    "the optimal power allocation for the relay node is always water - filling , but the power allocation for the source node is not water - filling in general . in scenario ii , the channel resource allocation parameter @xmath0 needs to be same for all channel states but can be jointly optimized with the power allocation . in scenario iii , which is the most general scenario ,",
    "@xmath0 can change with channel realizations and is jointly optimized with power allocation . for both scenarios ii and iii , we derive the jointly optimal @xmath0 and power allocation that maximize the achievable rate .",
    "furthermore , we show that the lower bound achieves the cut - set upper bound if the channel statistics and power constraint satisfy a certain condition .",
    "we hence establish the capacity for these channels over all possible power and channel resource allocations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : pararelay ] , the parallel relay channel is introduced and studied . in section [ sec : gauss ] , the optimal resource allocation that achieves the capacity for the gaussian parallel relay channel with degraded subchannels is studied . in section [ sec : fullrelay ] , resource allocation for the fading full - duplex relay channel is presented . in section [ sec : halfrelay ] , resource allocation for the fading half - duplex relay channel is studied , where the three scenarios described above are considered .",
    "finally in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we give concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we study the parallel relay channel , which serves as a basic information - theoretic model for the fading relay channels that are considered in sections [ sec : fullrelay ] and [ sec : halfrelay ] .",
    "the parallel relay channel also models the relay channel where the source and relay nodes can transmit over multiple frequency bands with each subchannel corresponding to the channel over one frequency band .",
    "it is shown in this section that in contrast to the parallel point - to - point channel , the parallel relay channel is not a simple combination of independent subchannels .    a parallel relay channel with @xmath2 subchannels ( see fig .",

    "we further choose @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 to be independent , and then obtain the lower bound .",

    "[ rk : crossflow ] in the achievable scheme , the relay node first decodes information sent by the source node over each subchannel .",

    "hence information that was sent to the relay node over one subchannel may be forwarded to the destination node over other subchannels , as long as the total rate at which the relay node can forward information to the destination node over all subchannels is larger than the total rate at which the relay node can decode information from the source node .",
    "the lower and upper bounds in theorem [ th : paralowup ] do not match in general .",
    "we next study a class of parallel relay channels with degraded subchannels . for this channel ,",
    "the lower and upper bounds match , and we hence establish the capacity . moreover , this capacity provides an achievable rate for the case where the subchannels are either stochastically degraded or reversely degraded ( e.g. , fading relay channels ) .",

    "hence for the subchannels with @xmath52 , the link from the source node to the relay node can be eliminated without changing the capacity of the channel .",
    "however , the relay node still plays an important role in the reversely degraded subchannels by forwarding information that it has decoded in other degraded subchannels to the destination node .",
