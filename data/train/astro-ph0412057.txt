    "the microquasar phenomenon has grown in prominence recently , as it has been found that most x - ray binaries show radio emission , associated with jets - collimated beams of relativistic plasma . the ejection takes place in a bipolar way perpendicular to the accretion disk associated with the compact star , a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "the word microquasar itself was chosen by the analogy of these astronomical objects with quasars and other active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at cosmological distances ( mirabel & rodrguez @xcite ) .",
    "the analogy quasar - microquasar goes beyond a simple morphological resemblance . today",
    ", there is growing evidence to think that the physics involved in both types of objects is the same , or at least very similar .",
    "the key difference would be the distinct order of magnitude of the most significant parameters , especially the mass of the compact object .",
    "agns are extragalactic sources whose spectra extend from radio waves to @xmath0-rays .",
    "thanks to the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) it is now well established that agns are strong @xmath0-ray emitters . the energetic gamma ray experiment ( egret ) on board the cgro produced the 3rd egret catalogue ( hartman et al .",
    "@xcite ) that contains 271 sources detected at energies @xmath1 100  mev .",
    "most of them ( about 168 sources ) remain unidentified and 72 of these unidentified sources are at absolute galactic latitudes lower than 10@xmath2 .",
    "the identified sources are mainly agns ( thomson et al .",
    "1995 ) , and more agns are expected to be found among the still unidentified sources with high galactic latitude .",
    "all of these detected agns are blazars ; no radio - quiet agns has been identified so far in the egret data .",
    "in fact this is not surprising because blazars are able to generate high - energy particles that can produce @xmath0-rays via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , as well as present relativistic beaming , which is important to avoid photon - photon collision and amplify the flux .",
    "more than two dozen jets have been detected at x - rays in agns , with most of them being radio galaxies ( both fri and frii ) .",
    "although synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) models can not generally explain the level of x - ray emission , those models based on the ic scattering of seed photons of the nucleus and the cmb radiation by the relativistic electrons in the jet not only can better explain such x - ray levels but also can produce efficiently high - energy @xmath0-ray emission ( tavecchio et al .",
    "@xcite , celotti et al .",
    "the most recent catalogue of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) contains 131 sources ( liu et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , while the catalogue of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) amounts to 149 objects ( liu et  al .",
    "@xcite ) . considering both catalogues together",
    ", there are a total of 43 radio emitting sources .",
    "some of these sources , those which we define as microquasars , show direct evidence for a relativistic radio jet ( rib @xcite , rib @xcite ) , while many others show radio emission which is also almost certainly associated with a jet ( fender 2004 ) .    at the time of writing ,",

    "the discovery of the microquasar ls  5039 , and its possible association with a high - energy @xmath0-ray source ( @xmath11100  mev ) , provides observational evidence that microquasars could also be sources of high - energy @xmath0-rays ( paredes et  al .",

    "this source is among the strongest comptel sources .",
    "the source region , detected at a high significance level , contains several possible counterparts , ls  5039 being one of them .",
    "it is also worth noting that batse has detected this source at soft @xmath0-rays ( see table  [ detections ] ) .",
    "taking into account these observational evidences , from radio to high - energy @xmath0-rays , ls  5039 appears to be a very likely counterpart of the egret source 3eg  j1824@xmath81514 .",
    "figure  [ ls5039 ] shows the observed spectral energy distribution of ls  5039 .",
    "after the discovery of relativistic jets in ls  i  + 61  303 , this source has been classified as a new microquasar ( massi et  al .",
    "@xcite , massi et  al .",
    "this object has also been proposed to be associated with the @xmath0-ray source 2cg  135 + 01 ( = 3eg  j0241 + 6103 ) ( gregory & taylor @xcite , kniffen et  al .",
    "although the broadband 1  kev100  mev spectrum of ls  i  + 61  303 remains uncertain , because osse and comptel observations were likely dominated by the quasar qso  0241 + 622 emission , the egret angular resolution is high enough to exclude this quasar as the source of the high - energy @xmath0-ray emission ( harrison et  al .",
    "batse marginally detected the source , the quasar also being excluded as the origin of this emission ( see table  [ detections ] ) .",

    "merlin images obtained in two consecutive days show a change in the direction of the jets of about 50@xmath2 that has been interpreted as a fast precession of the system ( massi et al .",

    "the very high energy sky map contains a reduced number of sources .",
