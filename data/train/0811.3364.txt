    "in the quantum computation , quantum control gates play a very important role .",
    "it was proven that two - qubit unitary gates and single - qubit gates are sufficient for universal quantum computation @xcite . in linear optics ,",
    "many schemes are provided for the realization of two - qubit unitary gates , for example , controlled - not ( cnot ) gates @xcite or controlled - phase gates @xcite . however , some of these gates work on the coincidence basis which results in these gates are not scalable , _",
    "i.e. _ , these gates can not be used to realize multi - qubit gates and then the universal computation . moreover ,",
    "all these gates are probabilistic which result in the probability of the realization of universal computation may be tiny , for the reason that many two - qubit unitary gates required . for example , quantum fredkin gate can be constructed by five cnot gates and some single - qubit gates @xcite , and the probability of cnot gate is only @xmath0 in linear optics @xcite , then the probability of fredkin gate is @xmath1 . to avoid the inefficient , more efficient even deterministic gates must be looked for . fortunately , with the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity , a parity projector @xcite and a deterministic cnot gate @xcite had been proposed , and then the universal computation can be realized deterministic in principle .",
    "however , the universal computation and even a multi - qubit gate may be need too many cnot gates , then the structure may be too complex to be realized in optics .",
    "alternatively , it is interesting to look for some multi - qubit gates with simple structure even though the probability is not unit . in this paper , we will present the quantum control gates with very simple structure , and we think these gates may be more feasible with the current experimental technology .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we first propose a scheme of a gate we call it controlled - path ( c - path ) gate with the weak cross - kerr nonlinearities , and then use this gate to realize all possible bipartite positive - operator - value measurements ( povms ) of two - photon polarization states .",
    "in addition , this technique is developed to realize the cnot gate , fredkin gate , toffoli gate , controlled - u ( cu ) gate and even multi - controlled - u ( mcu ) gate .",
    "sec.iii is for conclusion remarks .",
    "before we outline our schemes of quantum control gates , we briefly review the useful weak cross - kerr nonlinearity which has been used in refs . @xcite .",
    "suppose a non - linear weak cross - kerr interaction between a signal state ( photonic qubit ) @xmath2 and a coherent state @xmath3 .",
    "after the evolution , the output state is , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is induced by the nonlinearity . through a general homodyne - heterodyne measurement of the phase of the coherent state , the signal state @xmath6 will be projected into a definite number state or superposition of number states . because the measurement can be performed with high fidelity ,",
    "the projection is nearly deterministic .",
    "this technique has first been used to realize a parity projector @xcite , and then a cnot gate@xcite .",
    "it provides a new route to new quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the requirement for this technique is @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the amplitude of the coherent state .",
    "even with the weak nonlinearity ( @xmath5 is small ) , this requirement can be satisfied with large amplitude of the coherent state , then this requirement may be feasible with current experimental technology .",
    "our schemes of quantum control gates also work with the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "firstly , we discuss the c - path gate . here",
    ", we use the polarization of photons as qubit and define the horizontally ( vertically ) linear polarization @xmath9(@xmath10 ) as the qubit @xmath11(@xmath12 ) .",
    "consider a two - qubit initially prepared in the state @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . in a c - path gate ,",
    "the paths of the first photon are controlled by the second photon .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the control photon is transmitted through a balanced mach - zehnder ( m - z ) interferometer formed by two polarizing beam splitters ( pbs@xmath15 , pbs@xmath16 ) which let the photon @xmath17 be passed and the photon @xmath10 be reflected , while the target photon is injected into a 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "the two photons combined with a coherent state @xmath3 interact with the cross - kerr nonlinearities , such that a phase shift will be induced in the coherent state .",
    "suppose the control photon induces a controlled phase shift @xmath18 , while the target photon induces a controlled phase shift @xmath5 , then the input state @xmath19 will evolve to the follows : @xmath20 where the superscripts @xmath21 , @xmath22 denote the paths of the first photon . through a general homodyne - heterodyne measurement ( x homodyne measurement )",
    ", the two - photon state will be projected into the following state , @xmath23 here we only retain the case that no phase shift induced in the coherent state , and the success probability is @xmath24 . if a switch ( s ) which will exchange the two photons and a phase shift conditionally controlled by the homodyne detection through a classical feedforward are applied , this c - path gate is nearly deterministic , i.e. , @xmath25 . by the same way , one can implement a multi - controlled - path gate in which multiple qubits control the paths of the other qubits .",
    "this c - path gate is very useful in the quantum computation for the reason that many quantum control gates ( for example , cnot gate , fredkin gate , etc . )",
    "can be realized by some operations performed in the different paths of the target photons .",
    "these schemes of quantum control gates will be discussed in the following .",
    "now we discuss the first use of this control - path gate .",
    "if we place a half wave plate ( hwp , set at 22.5@xmath26-hadamard gate ) in the path of the control photon which is shown in the dashed line of the fig.1 , the following state can be achieved , @xmath27 if the detection of the control photon infers its polarization is @xmath17 , the initial state @xmath28 has been transferred onto the following state of a single photon in the hilbert space of its polarization and path states , @xmath29 the success probability is @xmath30 . if a classical feedforward phase shift @xmath31 is induced to the path @xmath22 when the detection infers the polarization of the control photon is @xmath10 , the success probability will increase to @xmath32 .",
    "the transformation @xmath33 is crucial for the realization of all possible bipartite povms of two - photon polarization states in ref . @xcite . in their scheme , a special three - photon entangled state created by a quantum fredkin gate and a teleportation process of five photons",
    "are required for this transformation .",
    "it is evident that our scheme is better than their scheme in the amount of resource , the complexity of the operations , and the great advantage of our scheme is the success probability is nearly unity which makes the realization of all possible bipartite povms of two - photon polarization states nearly deterministic .",
    "secondly , we discuss the cnot gate .",
    "suppose two photons initially prepared in the state @xmath28 , and the cnot gate can be described by the following transformation , @xmath34 the experimental setup is shown in fig.2 , here the first photon is the control photon which is transmitted through a balanced m - z interferometer formed by two pbss ( pbs@xmath15 , pbs@xmath16 ) , while the target photon is also transmitted through a balanced  m - z interferometer formed by two bss ( bs@xmath15 , bs@xmath16 ) whose transmissivity ( reflectivity )  are @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) respectively .",
    "a single - photon operation @xmath37 is performed in one arm . with the cross - kerr nonlinearities and a x homodyne measurement associated with the classical feedforward",
    ", the following states can be achieved in the output , @xmath38 or@xmath39 compared with the eq .",
    "( 6 ) , it is immediately to find that the cnot operation is completed when the condition @xmath40 is satisfied , and the success probability @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to find that the maximum success probability is @xmath42 when @xmath43 .",
    "compared with the scheme proposed by nemoto _",
    "et al _ @xcite , our scheme is probabilistic but no ancilla photons are required .",
    "thirdly , we discuss the fredkin gate which is also called controlled - swap gate .",
    "consider a single photon ( control photon ) in the state @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , and two photons ( target photons ) in the state @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , where @xmath48 are the bell states .",
    "a fredkin gate can be described by the following transformation , @xmath49 that is , if the control photon is in the state @xmath9 , the target two photons are unchanged ; while the control photon is in the state @xmath10 , a swap operation is implemented to the target two photons . for the reason that , only the singlet state @xmath50 is antisymmetric while the other three bell states are symmetric , the swap operation only results in a phase shift @xmath31 to the state @xmath51 while the other states unchanged .",
    "our scheme of the fredkin gate is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the control photon is transmitted through a balanced m - z interferometer formed by two pbss ( pbs@xmath15 , pbs@xmath16 ) , while the two target photons are transmitted through a balanced m - z interferometer formed by two bss ( bs@xmath15 , bs@xmath16 or bs@xmath52 , bs@xmath53 ) whose transmissivity ( reflectivity )  are @xmath35 or @xmath54 ( @xmath36 or @xmath55 ) respectively .",
    "in addition , a balanced m - z interferometer ( in the dashed line of fig.3 ) formed by two bss ( bs@xmath56 , bs@xmath57 ) associated with a phase shift @xmath31 in one arm is required .",
    "the hong - ou - mandel interference in this m - z interferometer yields the following transformation @xcite : @xmath58 compared with the above two schemes , we change the phase shift induced by the control photon to be @xmath59 , while the phase shift is @xmath5 for the two target photons .",
    "if the cross - kerr nonlinearities are used and we retain the case that no phase shift induced in the coherent state , we will achieve the following state in the output : @xmath60 compared with the eq.(9 ) , the fredkin gate is realized when the condition @xmath61 is satisfied , then the success probability is @xmath62 .",
    "hence the maximum success probability is @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , if a m - z interferometer which is same to the m - z interferometer in the dashed line associated with a phase shift @xmath31 conditionally controlled by the homodyne detection ( the phase of the coherent state is @xmath65 ) through a classical feedforward , is implemented in the outputs of bs@xmath16 and bs@xmath53 , the probability may be @xmath66 .",
    "now we compare our scheme of fredkin gate with the previous schemes . in 1989 , milburn used the cross - kerr nonlinearities to realize the fredkin gate @xcite , however , its cross - kerr nonlinearities operate in single photon level , so it requires huge nonlinearities which is a great challenge for the current experimental technology . in linear optics ,",
    "two types of fredkin gate , heralded gate and post - selected gate , had been proposed @xcite .",
    "exclusive of the requirement of ancilla photons and small probability , the shortcomings of these gates are obvious .",
    "the heralded fredkin gates require single - photon detectors which is also a great challenge for the current technology , and the post - selected fredkin gates work on the coincidence basis which results in these gates are not scalable . compared with these schemes , only the coherent states are required in our scheme , and the structure is so simple that we think it is feasible with the current technology .",
    "a little change that a cnot gate or arbitrary two - qubit unitary gate replaces the setups in the dashed line of the fig.3 , associated with appropriate transmissivities of the four beam splitters , is enough for the realization of the toffoli gate or the cu gate . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the probability of toffoli gate and the cu gate . for the toffoli gate ,",
    "two coherent states are required because a cnot gate is included in this scheme .",
    "consider a single photon ( control photon ) in the state @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , and two photons ( target photons ) in the state @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "suppose that the transmissivities ( reflectivities )  of the four bss are @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) respectively , now the modified scheme of the fredkin gate will evolve the initial state @xmath71 to the follows ( here we also retain the case that no phase shift induced in the coherent state ) , @xmath72 where the coefficient @xmath73 is induced by the cnot gate .",
    "the toffoli gate is completed when the condition @xmath74 is satisfied .",
    "the success probability is @xmath75 .",
    "choose @xmath76{2}+1}$ ] , the success probability may be @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , a cnot gate conditional controlled by the homodyne detection ( the phase of the coherent state is @xmath65 ) through a classical feedforward is implemented in the outputs of bs@xmath16 and bs@xmath53 , the probability may be @xmath78 .    in linear optics ,",
    "two types of toffoli gate , heralded gate and post - selected gate , had been proposed @xcite .",
    "similarly , exclusive of the requirement of ancilla photons and small probability , the uses of single - photon detectors and the coincidence measurement limit their use in the universal computation .",
    "these shortcomings are not exist in our scheme , and the simple structure makes it much feasible with current technology .    the realization of cu gate is similar , and the success probability is determined by the probability of the arbitrary unitary gate ( suppose as @xmath79 ) which can be realized by some cnot gates and single - qubit gates , and the transmissivities of the four beam splitters .",
    "the condition for the cu gate is @xmath80 .",
    "also choose @xmath81{p}+1}$ ] , the success probability of cu gate may be @xmath82{p}% + 1}\\right )   ^{4}$ ] , and it may be @xmath83{p}+1}\\right )   ^{4}$ ] with some additional setups similar to the toffoli gate .",
    "in addition , it is straightforward to develop this technique to the realization of mcu gate which is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the realization is described in the following .",
    "the control photons are all transmitted through a balanced m - z interferometer formed by two pbss respectively , while the target photons are all transmitted through a balanced m - z interferometer formed by two bss respectively .",
    "next , similar to the setups in the dashed line of fig.3 , in one arm of all the m - z interferometers form by the bss , we implement a multi - qubit unitary gate which can be realized by the quantum control gates described above .",
    "assisted by some coherent states and the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity , the mcu gate can be realized associated with the appropriate transmissivities of the bss .",
    "compared with the realization of mcu gate with many cnot gates and single - qubit gates , our scheme can reduce the complexity of the realization greatly .",
    "in this paper , with the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity , we first present a special experimental scheme called c - path gate with which the realization of all possible bipartite povms of two - photon polarization states can be simpler and nearly deterministic .",
    "following the same technique , the schemes of the realization of quantum control gates have been proposed , including the cnot gate @xmath84 , fredkin gate @xmath85 , toffoli gate @xmath86 , cu gate and even mcu gate .",
    "all these gates are scalable with the certain probabilities which are larger than those gates in linear optics .",
    "less resource are required and the structures of these gates are so simple that we think they are feasible with current technology and may be useful for the realization of universal computation in optics .",
