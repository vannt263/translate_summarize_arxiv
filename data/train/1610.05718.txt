    "electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) is a recently developed non - invasive imaging technique , where the inner structure of a reference object can be recovered from the current and voltage measurements on the object s surface .",
    "it is fast , inexpensive , portable and requires no ionizing radiation . for these reasons",
    ", eit qualifies for continuous real time visualization right at the bedside .    in clinical eit applications ,",
    "the reconstructed images are usually obtained by minimizing the linearized - data - fit residuum @xcite .",
    "these algorithms are fast and simple . however , to the best of the authors knowledge , there is no rigorous global convergence results that have been proved so far .",
    "moreover , the reconstructed images usually tend to contain ringing artifacts .",
    "recently , seo and one of the author have shown in @xcite that a single linearized step can give the correct shape of the conductivity contrast .",
    "this result raises a question that whether to regularize the linearized - data - fit functional such that the corresponding minimizer yields a good approximation of the conductivity contrast .",
    "an affirmative answer has been proved in @xcite for the continuum boundary data . in the present paper",
    ", we shall apply this new algorithm to the real electrode setting and test with standard phantom experiment data .",
    "numerical results later on show that this new algorithm helps to improve the quality of the reconstructed images as well as reduce the ringing artifacts .",
    "it is worth to mention that our new algorithm is non - iterative , hence , it does not depend on an initial guess and does not require expensive computation .",
    "other non - iterative algorithms , for example , the factorization method @xcite and the monotonicity - based method @xcite , on the other hand , are much more sensitive to measurement errors than our new algorithm when phantom data or real data are applied @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : setting ] we introduce the mathematical setting , describe how the measured data can be collected and set up a link between the mathematical setting and the measured data .",
    "section [ sec : algorithm ] presents our new algorithm and the numerical results were shown in section [ sec : num ] .",
    "we conclude this paper with a brief discussion in section",
    "let @xmath0 describe the imaging subject and @xmath1 be the unknown conductivity distribution inside @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 is a bounded domain with smooth boundary @xmath3 and that the function @xmath4 is real - valued , strictly positive and bounded .",
    "electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) aims at recovering @xmath4 using voltage and current measurements on the boundary of @xmath2 .",
    "there are several ways to inject currents and measure voltages .",
    "we shall follow the _ neighboring method _ ( aka adjacent method ) which was suggested by brown and segar in 1987 @xcite and is still widely being used by practitioners . in this method ,",
    "electrodes are attached on the object s surface , and an electrical current is applied through a pair of adjacent electrodes whilst the voltage is measured on all other pairs of adjacent electrodes excluding those pairs containing at least one electrode with injected current .",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the unit normal vector on @xmath33 pointing outward and @xmath34 describes the @xmath13-th applied current pattern where a current of strength @xmath35 is driven through the @xmath13-th and @xmath36-th electrode . notice",

    "the voltage measurements are given by @xmath39    the herein used shunt model ignores the effect of contact impedances between the electrodes and the imaging domain .",
    "this is only valid when voltages are measured on small ( see @xcite ) and current - free electrodes , so that ( [ eqn : shunt ] ) correctly models only the measurements @xmath40 with @xmath41 . for difference measurements ,",
    "the missing elements @xmath42 with @xmath43 , on the other hand , can be calculated by interpolation taking into account reciprocity , conservation of voltages and the geometry - specific smoothness of difference eit data , cf .",
    "@xcite . for an imaging subject with unknown conductivity @xmath4 , one thus obtains a full matrix of measurements @xmath44 .",

    "the popular algorithms noser @xcite and greit @xcite use ( generalized ) tikhonov regularization and minimize @xmath62 with ( heuristically chosen ) weighted euclidian norms @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the residuum and penalty term .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that shape information in eit is invariant under linearization .",
    "thus one - step linearization methods are principally capable of reconstructing the correct ( outer ) support of the conductivity difference even though they ignore the non - linearity of the eit measurement process . in @xcite the authors developed a monotonicity - based regularization method for the linearized eit equation for which ( in the continuum model ) it can be guaranteed that the regularized solutions converge against a function that shows the correct outer shape . in this section ,",
    "we formulate and analyze this new method for real electrode measurements , and in the next section we will apply it to real data from a phantom experiment and compare it with the greit method .",
    "the main idea of monotonicity - based regularization is to minimize the residual of the linearized equation  ( [ eqn : one_step_linearized ] ) @xmath65 with constraints on the entries of @xmath66 that are obtained from monotonicity tests .    for the following ,",
    "we assume that the background is homogeneous and that all anomalies are more conductive , or all anomalies are less conductive than the background , i.e. , @xmath47 is constant , and either @xmath67 @xmath68 is an open set denoting the conductivity anomalies , and @xmath69 is the contrast of the anomalies .",
    "we furthermore assume that we are given a lower bound @xmath70 of the anomaly contrast , i.e. @xmath71 .    for the monotonicity tests it is crucial to consider the measurements and the columns of the sensitivity matrix @xmath58 as matrices and compare them in terms of matrix definiteness , cf .",

    "moreover , @xcite also shows that for noisy data and using the regularized constraints @xmath96 , minimizers exist and that , for @xmath97 , they converge to the minimizer with the correct support . since practical electrode measurements can be regarded as an approximation to the continuum model , we therefore expect that the above approach will also well approximate the anomaly support for real electrode data .    in the continuum model , the constraints @xmath84 will be zero outside the support of the anomaly and positive for each pixel inside the anomaly .",
    "the first property relies on the existence of localized potentials @xcite and is only true in the limit of infinitely many , infinitely small electrodes .",
    "the latter property is however true for any number of electrodes as the following result shows :    [ thm : beta_k ] if @xmath98 , then    a.   in the case @xmath86 the constraint @xmath84 fulfills @xmath99 , and b.   in the case @xmath88 the constraint @xmath84 fulfills @xmath100 .    if @xmath98 and @xmath86 then @xmath101 and if @xmath98 and @xmath88 then @xmath102 hence , it suffices to show that @xmath103 holds for all @xmath104 that fulfill    a.   @xmath105 , or b.   @xmath106 .",

    "we emphasize that , figure [ fig:3b ] ( regularization parameter is chosen as @xmath117 by default ) was considered at the eidors tutorial web - page , we show them here again in order to easily compare them with the reconstructed images using our new method later on",

    "however , in the experiment setting , the reference body was a cylinder of diameter @xmath119 m and the reference conductivity was @xmath120 s / m .",
    "hence , an appropriate scaling factor should be applied to the measurements , to make sure that the eidors model fits with these measurements . in the eidors",
    "tutorial web - page , the measurements were scaled by multiplying by a factor @xmath121 . in this paper , to increase the precision of the model , we shall find the best scaling factor that minimizes the error between the measured data and the data generated by the eidors model .",
    "more precisely , let call ` vh ` the measured data for homogeneous case and ` vh\\_model ` the homogeneous data generated by the eidors model , the best scaling factor is a minimizer of the following problem @xmath122 for this experiment setting , the best factor is @xmath123 .",
    "from now on , by measured data we always refer to scaled measured data with respect to this best factor .",
    "+    the next step is to recover the missing measurements on the driving electrodes .",
    "we shall follow the result in @xcite to obtain an approximation for these missing measurements using interpolation .",
    "now we are in a position to minimize the problem ( [ eq : min_lin_res ] ) under the linear constraint ( c1 ) or ( c2 ) .",
    "to do this , we need to clarify @xmath124 and @xmath84 in the linear constraints . after scaling ,",
    "the reference conductivity is @xmath125 s / m , and @xmath68 still denotes the plexiglas rod with conductivity @xmath126 s / m .",

    "indeed , what we know is just the measured data @xmath129 , where @xmath130 denotes the noise level .",
    "when replacing @xmath80 by the noisy version @xmath131 , it may happen that there is no @xmath104 so that the matrix @xmath132 is still positive semi - definite . therefore , instead of using ( [ betak ] )",
    ", we shall calculate @xmath84 from @xmath133 here , @xmath134 represents the identity matrix , and @xmath130 is chosen as the absolute value of the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath92 .",
    "notice that , in the presence of noise , @xmath135 plays the role of the positive semi - definite matrix @xmath80 .",
    "we shall follow the argument in @xcite to calculate @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the lower triangular cholesky decomposition matrix of @xmath135 , and let @xmath136 be the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath137 . since @xmath76 is negative semi - definite ,",
    "so is @xmath137 .",
    "thus , @xmath138 .",
    "arguing in the same manner as in @xcite , we get @xmath139    the minimizer of ( [ eq : min_lin_res ] ) is then obtained using two different approaches : one employs ` cvx ` ( figure [ fig:4a ] ) , a package for specifying and solving convex programs @xcite , the other ( figure [ fig:4b ] ) uses the ` matlab ` built - in function ` quadprog ` ( ` trust - region - reflective ` algorithm ) .",

    "notice that reconstructed images are highly affected by the choice of the minimization algorithms , and we will see from figure [ fig:4 ] that the images obtained by ` cvx ` has less artifacts than the others .    it is worth to emphasize that although each eidors model is assigned to a default regularization parameter , when using the eidors built - in function ` inv\\_solve ` @xcite , in order to obtain a good reconstruction ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) one has to manually choose a regularization parameter , whilst the regularization parameters @xmath140 and @xmath84 in our method are known a - priori provided the information of the conductivity @xmath4 and the reference conductivity @xmath47 exists .",
