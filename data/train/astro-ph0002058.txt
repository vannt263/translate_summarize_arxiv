    "the nature of the dark matter in the haloes of galaxies is an outstanding problem in astrophysics . over the last several decades",
    "there has been great debate about whether this matter is baryonic or must be exotic .",
    "many astronomers believed that a stellar or substellar solution to this problem might be the most simple and therefore most plausible explanation .",
    "however , in the last few years , these candidates have been ruled out as significant components of the galactic halo .",
    "i will discuss limits on these stellar candidates , and argue for my personal conviction that : _ most of the dark matter in the galactic halo must be nonbaryonic . _    until recently , stellar candidates for the dark matter , including faint stars , brown dwarfs , white dwarfs , and neutron stars , were extremely popular .",
    "however , recent analysis of various data sets has shown that faint stars and brown dwarfs probably constitute no more than a few percent of the mass of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "specifically , using hubble space telescope and parallax data , we showed that faint stars and brown dwarfs contribute no more than 1% of the mass density of the galaxy .",
    "microlensing experiments ( the macho @xcite , @xcite and eros @xcite ) experiments ) , which were designed to look for massive compact halo objects ( machos ) , also failed to find these light stellar objects and ruled out substellar dark matter candidates in the @xmath3 mass range .",
    "recently white dwarfs have received attention as possible dark matter candidates .",
    "interest in white dwarfs has been motivated by microlensing events interpreted as being in the halo , with a best fit mass of @xmath4 .",
    "however , i will show that stellar remnants including white dwarfs and neutron stars are extremely problematic as dark matter candidates .",
    "a combination of excessive infrared radiation , mass budget issues and chemical abundances constrains the abundance of stellar remnants in the halo quite severely , as shown below .",
    "hence , white dwarfs , brown dwarfs , faint stars , and neutron stars are either ruled out or extremely problematic as dark matter candidates .",
    "thus the puzzle remains , what are the 14 macho events that have been interpreted as being in the halo of the galaxy ?",
    "are some of them actually located elsewhere , such as in the lmc itself ?",
    "these questions are currently unanswered .",
    "as regards the dark matter in the halo of our galaxy , one is driven to nonbaryonic constituents as the bulk of the matter .",
    "possibilities include supersymmetric particles , axions , primordial black holes , or other exotic candidates .    in this talk i will focus on the arguments against stellar remnants as candidates for a substantial fraction of the dark matter , as white dwarfs in particular have been the focus of attention as potential explanations of microlensing data . for a discussion of limits on faint stars and brown dwarfs ,",
    "see earlier conference proceedings by freese , fields , and graff ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "stellar remnants ( white dwarfs and neutron stars ) face a number of problems and issues as dark matter candidates : 1 ) infrared radiation ; 2 ) imf ( initial mass function ) ; 3 ) baryonic mass budget ; 4 ) element abundances .",
    "we find that none of the expected signatures in the above list of a significant white dwarf component in the galactic halo are seen to exist .      the mere existence of multi - tev @xmath5-rays seen in the hegra experiment places a powerful constraint on the allowed abundance of white dwarfs .",
    "this arises because the progenitors of the white dwarfs would produce infrared radiation that would prevent the @xmath5-rays from getting here .",
    "the @xmath5-rays and infrared photons would interact via @xmath6 .",
    "multi - tev @xmath5-rays from the blazar mkn 501 at a redshift z=0.034 are seen in the hegra detector . the cross section for ( 1 - 10)tev @xmath5-rays peaks at infrared photon energies of ( 0.03 - 3)ev .",
    "photons in this energy range would be produced in abundance by the progenitor stars to white dwarfs and neutron stars . by requiring that the optical depth due to @xmath6 be less than one for a source at @xmath7 we limit the cosmological density of stellar remnants @xcite to @xmath8 .",
    "this constraint is quite robust and model independent , as it applies to a variety of models for stellar physics , star formation rate and redshift , mass function , and clustering .",

    "we begin by estimating the contribution of machos to the mass density of the universe .",
    "microlensing results @xcite predict that the total mass of machos in the galactic halo out to 50 kpc is @xmath9 now one can obtain a  macho - to - light \" ratio for the halo by dividing by the luminosity of the milky way ( in the b - band ) , @xmath10 to obtain @xmath11 > from the eso slice project redshift survey @xcite , the luminosity density of the universe in the @xmath12 band is @xmath13 if we assume that the @xmath14 which we defined for the milky way is typical of the universe as a whole , then the universal mass density of machos is @xmath15 where the critical density @xmath16 .",

    "to conservatively allow for the full range of possibilities , we will adopt @xmath19 thus , if the galactic halo macho interpretation of the microlensing results is correct , machos make up an important fraction of the baryonic matter of the universe . specifically , the central values give @xmath20 however , the lower limit on this fraction is considerably less restrictive , @xmath21    [ [ mass - budget - constraints - from - machos - as - stellar - remnants - white - dwarfs - or - neutron - stars ] ] mass budget constraints from machos as stellar remnants : white dwarfs or neutron stars + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in general , white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black holes all came from significantly heavier progenitors . hence , the excess mass left over from the progenitors must be added to the calculation of @xmath22 ; the excess mass then leads to stronger constraints .",
    "typically we find the contribution of macho progenitors to the mass density of the universe to be @xmath23 .",
    "the central values of all the numbers now imply @xmath24 , which is obviously unacceptable .",
    "one is driven to the lowest values of @xmath25 and highest value of @xmath26 to avoid this problem .",
    "the overproduction of carbon and/or nitrogen produced by white dwarf progenitors is one of the greatest difficulties faced by a white dwarf dark matter scenario , as first noted by gibson and mould @xcite .",
    "stellar carbon yields for zero metallicity stars are quite uncertain . still , according to the yields by @xcite",
    ", a star of mass 2.5@xmath27 will produce about twice the solar enrichment of carbon .",
    "however , stars in our galactic halo have carbon abundance in the range @xmath28 solar .",
    "hence the ejecta of a large population of white dwarfs would have to be removed from the galaxy via a galactic wind .",
    "however , carbon abundances in intermediate redshift  forest lines have recently been measured to be quite low , at the @xmath29 solar level @xcite , for  systems at @xmath30 with column densities @xmath31 ( for lower column densities , the mean c / h drops to @xmath32 solar @xcite .    in order to maintain carbon abundances as low as @xmath33 solar , only about @xmath33 of all baryons",
    "can have passed through the intermediate mass stars that were the predecessors of machos @xcite .",
    "such a fraction can barely be accommodated for the remnant density predicted from our extrapolation of the macho group results , and would be in conflict with @xmath34 in the case of a single burst of star formation .",
    "note that stars heavier than 4@xmath27 may replace the carbon overproduction problem with nitrogen overproduction @xcite .    using the yields described above , we calculated the c and n that would result from the stellar processing for a variety of initial mass functions for the white dwarf progenitors .",
    "we used a chemical evolution model based on a code described in fields & olive @xcite to obtain our numerical results .",
    "our results are presented in the figure .    in the figure",
    ", we make the parameter choices that are in agreement with d and he@xmath35 measurements ( see the discussion below ) and are the least restrictive when comparing with the ly@xmath36 measurements .",
    "we take an initial mass function ( imf ) sharply peaked at 2@xmath27 , so that there are very few progenitor stars heavier than 3@xmath27 ( this imf is required by d and he@xmath35 measurements ) . in addition",
    "( see the figures in fields , freese , and graff @xcite ) we have considered a variety of other parameter choices . by comparing with the observations , we obtain the limit , @xmath37 . as a caveat ,",
    "note that it is possible that carbon never leaves the ( zero metallicity ) white dwarf progenitors , so that carbon overproduction is not a problem @xcite .      because of the uncertainty in the c and n yields from low - metallicity stars , we have also calculated the d and he@xmath35 abundances that would be produced by white dwarf progenitors .",
    "these are far less uncertain as they are produced farther out from the center of the star and do not have to be dredged up from the core .",

    "also shown are the initial values from big bang nucleosynthesis and the ( very generous ) range of primordial values of d and he@xmath35 from observations .",
    "> from d and he alone , we can see that the white dwarf progenitor imf must be peaked at low masses , @xmath38 .",

    "one of the most difficult aspects of microlensing is the degeneracy of the interpretation of the data , so that it is currently impossible to determine whether the lenses lie in the galactic halo , or in the disk of the milky way , or in the lmc .",
    "in particular , it is possible that the lmc is thicker than previously thought so that the observed events are due to self - lensing of the lmc .",
