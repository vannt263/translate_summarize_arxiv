    "color gradients in galaxies reveal information about the nature of their stellar populations via age and metallicity trends , and the amount and distribution of dust .",
    "the technique of using broad - band colors as a probe of the stellar populations and star formation histories ( sfh ) of galaxies , pioneered by , e.g. searle , sargent , & bagnuolo ( 1973 ) and tinsley & gunn ( 1976 ) , is still reflected in the modern studies of peletier & balcells ( 1994 ) , de  jong ( 1996 ) , and bell & de  jong ( 2000 ; hereafter bdj00 ) .",
    "early analyses , however , suffered significantly from degeneracies between age and metallicity .",
    "worthey ( 1994 ) quantified the age - metallicity degeneracy that exists in optical broad - band colors as @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that the composite spectrum of an old stellar population is nearly indistinguishable from that of a younger but more metal - rich population ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this degeneracy can be partially broken with infrared photometry ( e.g.  @xmath4 or @xmath5 band ) in addition to optical colors ( de  jong 1996 ) .",
    "cardiel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have quantified the relative ability of different color and absorption - line index combinations to constrain physical parameters of composite stellar populations .",
    "their results find that inclusion of an infrared band improves the predictive power of the stellar population diagnostics by @xmath6x over using optical colors alone .",
    "the interpretation of broad - band color gradients also relies on a careful mapping of the dust extinction within a galaxy ( witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ; de  jong 1996 ) .",
    "while dust opacity is much reduced at redder wavelengths , its effects may still be non - negligible in the determination of the stellar content of late - type spiral galaxies and must be considered in the final interpretation of color gradients .",
    "a successful galaxy formation theory must determine the formation timescales for bulges and disks and reproduce the observed stellar ages and chemical distributions in galaxies as a function of galaxy properties .",
    "competing bulge / disk formation scenarios entail distinct structural and kinematic signatures , star formation rates ( sfrs ) , and mixing of the bulge and disk material , that a study of age and metallicity indicators could help disentangle .",
    "current theories for the formation of disk bulges generally fall under two basic pictures : monolithic collapse ( e.g.   larson 1974 ; calberg 1984 ) and hierarchical merging ( e.g.  kauffmann 1996 ; cole et al .  2000 ) .",
    "the monolithic dissipative collapse of a gas cloud at high redshift is consistent with strong _ bulge _ metallicity gradients ( on the order of 0.5 dex / decade within the central @xmath02 kpc , but flattening in the outer parts ( larson 1974 ) ) , with metallicity decreasing with increasing radius , shallow positive age gradients ( the centers are slightly younger than the outer parts ) , and old stellar populations . in this `` monolithic '' scenario",
    "the disk would accrete onto the already formed bulge , and thus be younger than the bulge .",
    "the dominant signatures in the hierarchical scenario depend on the time evolution of the merger rate : if mergers were most frequent at high redshift , as predicted by present - epoch cosmological models , signatures should be similar to those of dissipative collapse .",
    "more recent mergers and tidal disruptions would result in flatter metallicity gradients , and a significant fraction of young or intermediate - age stars . in either of the above two scenarios ,",
    "secular evolution can also drive disk gas and stars to the center via bar instabilities .",
    "in general , this scenario predicts that bulges will be similar in metallicity and age and structurally linked to disks ( courteau , de jong , & broeils 1996 ; courteau 1996 ) .",
    "note , however , that the number of bar formation - gas inflow - star formation - bar dissolution cycles that can occur in a galaxy may be limited , as the central mass formed in the first cycle can prevent subsequent formation of a bar wyse ( 1999 ) . radial migration of disk material ( stars and gas ) can also be induced by non - axisymmetric spiral waves ( sellwood & binney 2002 ) , which would necessarilly flatten metallicity gradients in disks .",
    "current observational results ( o / h gradients , sfrs , constant imf , gas distribution ) favor an inside - out formation for the milky way , but the details about age and metallicity gradients in our own galaxy are conflicting ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 )",
    ". integrated studies of stellar populations in external galaxies can restrict the range of possible interpretations , but formation timescales and chemical evolution of external spiral galaxies have barely been explored ( e.g.  matteucci 2002 ) .",
    "these issues have become even more important now that cosmologically - motivated numerical simulations are capable of resolving the formation of disks and bulges .",
    "furthermore , semi - analytic galaxy evolution models use recipes to describe bulge and disk evolution , but if different types of galaxies have different bulge formation mechanisms , these models may give misleading results ( e.g.  somerville & primack 1999 ; van den bosch 2000 ) , unless a variety of bulge formation mechanisms are modeled ( e.g.  cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "existing studies of spiral bulges and disks have placed tentative constraints on the source of their color gradients and which galaxy parameters most strongly correlate with sfhs and , hence , on specific formation scenarios , but some of the results are conflicting . in an study of color gradients in early - type bulges ( @xmath7sb ) using hst and ground - based data , peletier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) infered that early - type bulges are old ( absolute ages not well determined ) with a small age spread ( @xmath8 2 gyr ) for all early - type bulges measured at the bulge effective radius .",
    "the old and narrow age range makes it unlikely that these bulges would have formed via secular evolution .",
    "the same conclusion does not hold for their ( few ) later - type galaxies .",
    "peletier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) conclude that the intrinsic color gradients of early - type bulges are caused mainly by metallicity gradients ( in agreement with other similar studies ; e.g.  mehlert et al .",
    "2003 ) , consistent with the monolithic collapse scenario .",
    "however , based on the lack of @xmath9 shaped bulges found in a later study of bulge sb profiles of s0sbc galaxies using hst near - ir high resolution imaging , balcells et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have revised their interpretation and conclude that these bulges could not have formed from violent relaxation in mergers , but rather are more consistent with secular formation processes . on the other hand , in an hst study of spatially resolved colors of high redshift ( @xmath10 ) galaxies in the hubble deep field , abraham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) rule out metallicity gradients as major contributors to galaxy color distributions .",
    "they do find , in agreement with peletier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , that large bulges are significantly older than their disks and therefore rule out secular evolution formation processes in favor of a gradual disk formation by accretion of gas .",
    "however , the flat metallicity distribution of the bulge is not easily explained in this scenario ( particularly since the lack of `` @xmath9 '' bulges rules out major merging as a cause of gradient flattening ) .",
    "the most comprehensive study to date of color gradients in disk galaxies is that of bdj00 , who compute age and metallicity gradients for a sample of 121 nearby low - inclination s0sd galaxies .",
    "they conclude that galaxy color gradients are due in most part to gradients in age and metallicity in their stellar populations ( in the sense that inner regions are older and more metal rich than outer regions ) and contend that dust reddening mainly affects the metallicity gradients , but is likely too small to affect their conclusions . in comparing the sfhs with galaxy parameters ,",
    "they conclude that the sfh of a galaxy is primarily driven by surface density and that the total stellar mass of a galaxy is a less important parameter that correlates significantly with metallicity , but not age .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) also conclude that the recent sfhs , as probed by the h@xmath11 absorption line index and the 4000  break , of over 100,000 galaxies are more strongly correlated with surface mass density than stellar mass .",
    "bdj00 argued that these correlations could be the result of a surface density - dependent star formation law , coupled with galaxy mass - dependent chemically enriched gas outflows .",
    "bell & bower ( 2000 ) further explored this idea by constructing a family of simple models for spiral galaxy evolution for comparison with the observational trends in sfh with galaxy parameters .",
    "indeed they found that the data are consistent with the proposition that the sfh of a region within a galaxy depends primarily on the local surface density of the gas but that additional ingredients , such as galaxy mass dependent infall(outflow ) of primordial(metal - enriched ) gas and/or formation epoch , are required to fully explain the observational results .    in spite of genuine progress in recent years in the study of spectro - photometric gradients in spiral galaxies , our ability to model and interpret them in terms of formation models",
    "is still limited due to the lack of data and the intricacies involved in converting observed quantities to reliable ages and metallicities . in this study",
    ", we use the largest catalog of deep optical and nir galaxy colors to date to revisit the comparison of broad - band color gradients with stellar population models using a range of sfhs and basic assumptions about the dust distribution .",
    "we follow the approach developed by bdj00 , exploring additional parameter ranges and using an extended data base by combining the bdj00 data with our own collection of deep , optical and nir surface brightness profiles ( courteau , holtzman , & macarthur 2004 , in prep . ;",
    "hereafter paper iii ) , for a total sample of 172 galaxies .",
    "for the combined data base we determine local average ages and metallicities in radial bins for each galaxy and compute gradients in age and metallicity as a function of radius .",
    "we pay special attention to the effects of fitting out to different physical extents for individual galaxies and the distinction between inner and outer galaxy gradients .",
    "in particular , we find that false trends can be inferred if the radial extent of the gradient fits is not taken into account , which in turn leads to erroneous conclusions about the galaxy parameters that drive their sfhs .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in",
    ", we describe the data base from which color gradients are computed .",
    "our color gradients are presented in paper iii , and further details of the bdj00 sample can be found in their  2 . in",
    "we explore the range of galaxy parameters in our sample and their intrinsic correlations which must be considered when comparing trends in age and metallicity gradients with galaxy parameters . in",
    ", we discuss the stellar population models to be compared to the data and the different star formation prescriptions adopted .",
    "dust models and its potential effects on our results are discussed in .",
    "optical - nir color - color profiles and their matching population models are presented in and trends with galaxy parameters are explored .",
    "the technique by which the data are fitted to the ssp models is presented in . local and global age and metallicities",
    "are presented in and their gradients are discussed in and and contrasted with previous results from bdj00 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the mechanisms that control stellar evolution in spiral galaxies and compare our results with existing models of galaxy evolution in .",
    "our data base from which color gradients are measured is a combination of the data in bdj00 and the compilation by courteau et al.(2004 , in prep . , paper iii ) of 1063 digital images in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath4 passbands of 324 nearby late - type spiral galaxies collected at the lowell observatory and kitt peak national observatory . for the current analysis we consider only the face - on and moderately tilted galaxies ( @xmath15 60@xmath16 ) in the sample .",
    "all galaxies were selected from the uppsala general catalogue of galaxies ( ugc , nilson 1973 ) to have : zwicky magnitude @xmath17 15.5 , blue galactic extinction @xmath18 05 @xcite , and blue major axis @xmath19 .",
    "for the computation of homogeneous structural parameters and color gradients we use the isophotal map determined at @xmath14-band and applied onto all other images ( @xmath20 ) of a galaxy .",
    "the sb profiles are reliable ( with sb errors @xmath21 0.12 mag arcsec@xmath22 ) down to @xmath0 26 mag arcsec@xmath22 for optical bands and @xmath0 22 mag arcsec@xmath22 at @xmath4-band . for the purpose of this color - based analysis",
    ", we further require that the galaxies have measured surface brightnesses in at least two optical and one near - ir ( @xmath4 ) band observations out to at least 1.5 @xmath4-band disk scale lengths and with sb errors of less than 0.12 mag arcsec@xmath22 .",
    "this leaves us with 51 galaxies ( 25 type i , 17 type ii , 9 transition ) with extended reliable color gradients .",
    "radial profiles were corrected for galactic extinction using the reddening values of schlegel et al .",
    "we do not attempt to correct our sb profiles for internal extinction , but discuss the possible effects of dust on our results in .",
    "the sb profiles were degraded to the worst seeing fwhm before computing color gradients .",
    "for a full description of the data see paper iii .    in order to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of our color profiles ,",
    "the sb profiles were averaged into radial bins scaled by the nir - band disk scale length , @xmath23 , and we required at least 3 data points per bin .",
    "the bin sizes were defined as follows :    @xmath24 @xmath25    the second , finer , grid ( @xmath26 ) was used to see if the coarser binning of @xmath27 hides any important features in the color profiles .",
    "the difference in using the two different binnings is small . in particular , this test confirmed that the measured gradients do not depend on the central pixels , which are likely to be more affected by a central concentration of dust in spiral galaxies .",
    "hence we subsequently use @xmath27 only ( as this is the binning of the bdj00 sample ) .    in order to look for trends in color gradients with galaxy parameters , we collected , for as many galaxies as possible , their morphological type , absolute magnitude , @xmath4-band disk central surface brightness ( csb ) , @xmath4-band disk scale length , inclination , total @xmath4-band magnitude , and rotational velocity @xmath28 ( see below ) . the structural parameters ( disk scale length , @xmath29 , and csb , @xmath30 )",
    "were computed using our bulge - to - disk decomposition scheme ( see paper i ) .",
    "total galaxy magnitudes encompass the light out to sb levels given above , and include an extrapolation of the sb profile to infinity with an exponential fit to the last quarter of the sb profile . the extrapolated magnitude increment ( 0.07 @xmath4-mag on average )",
    "is added to the isophotal magnitude which is corrected for galactic extinction ( schlegel et al .",
    "stellar masses are computed using the prescription of bell & de  jong ( 2001 ) .",
    "we merged our sample with the 121 galaxies from bdj00 which spans a wider range in hubble type ( s0irr ) and includes a few low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies . for the computation of color gradients",
    ", bdj00 required at least two optical ( @xmath31 ) and one @xmath5-band observations per galaxy .",
    "the data reductions and radial binning ( using only @xmath27 ) are very similar to our own . for 3 galaxies in common with both data sets",
    ", there is excellent agreement in the overall calibration and radial profiles at least for the @xmath32 bands ( paper iii ) .    in order to compare the two data sets",
    "directly when looking for trends in age and metallicity with galaxy parameters , we converted our @xmath4-band magnitudes and surface brightnesses into @xmath5-band using the 2mass @xmath33 color transformations derived from jarrett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "cccccccc mean @xmath33 & 0.30 & 0.26 & 0.30 & 0.28 & 0.28 & 0.24 & 0.21 +    since we are interested mainly in qualitative trends in age and metallicity with galaxy parameters , coarse transformations are adequate and we took the mean @xmath33 values for each hubble type , derived from their figure  16 and listed here in table  [ tab:2mass ] .",
    "the modified @xmath4 magnitude will be denoted as @xmath34 , to represent the @xmath5-band equivalent of the @xmath4-band measurement .",
    "we do , however , consider the disk scale lengths in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be directly comparable .",
    "m \" ollenhoff & heidt ( 2001 ) find @xmath35 for a sample of 40 spiral galaxies and the relationship will be even tighter for @xmath36 , hence a direct comparison of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 band disk scale lengths is justified .",
    "it has been suggested that age and metallicity gradients may depend upon the potential of the galaxy and thus vary as a function of @xmath28 ( dalcanton & bernstein 2002 ; garnett 2002a ) . in order to search for such a trend we augmented out catalog with or h@xmath37 line widths ( which we take to be @xmath38 , half the line width at 50% peak flux ) collected from the literature .",
    "these data will enable us to test for a distinct signature in the color profiles from the more prominent dust lanes seen in galaxies with @xmath39 120  ( dalcanton & bernstein 2002 ) and/or if there is a flattening of the metallicity of galaxies above @xmath40 150  ( garnett 2002a ) .",
    "the line widths were collected from various sources and transformations were derived to ensure uniformity between them ( see appendix  [ hiwidths ] ) .",
    "differences between measurements for a given galaxy for different sources were typically less than 10% , which is sufficient for our purposes .    in order to ensure sufficiently accurate @xmath28 measurements , we restricted our sample to galaxies with inclination greater than 35@xmath41 .",
    "we are left with 98 galaxies in our sample that have reliable rotational velocity measurements .",
    "trends in age and metallicity ( local values and gradients ) with galaxy parameters , may bear an imprint from intrinsic correlations within the sample itself . in figure",
    "[ fig : galpars ] we plot the galaxy parameters used in this analysis ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath42 , and @xmath28 ) against each other .",
    "the most notable correlations are the luminosity - rotation speed relation , @xmath42 versus log(@xmath28 ) ( the so - called `` tully - fisher '' relation ) , and the size - luminosity relation , @xmath42 versus log(@xmath29 ) .",
    "all correlations with @xmath30 are weaker and have large scatter . in figure",
    "[ fig : pars_morph ] we plot the 4 basic galaxy parameters as a function of morphological type .",
    "trends are seen with galaxy parameters for @xmath43 such that later - type galaxies have smaller rotational velocities and total magnitudes , and lower central surface brightness . on the other hand , there is no clear trend of disk scale length with hubble type ( and hence the trend with total magnitude is largely driven by the trend with csb , courteau et al .",
    "data points are few for @xmath44 , but deviations from the @xmath43 trends seem to occur .",
    "a larger spread is ( barely ) noticeable in @xmath28 , but is further supported by the larger spread in @xmath42 for which we have more galaxies ( unfortunately , reliable @xmath28s could not be found for the earliest - type galaxies . ) the increasing trend in @xmath30 with decreasing @xmath45 seems to level off at @xmath44 , but the spread is still significant . finally , earliest - type galaxies have the shortest scale lengths , as expected .",
    "we shall return to these correlations in the analysis of trends in age and metallicity gradients ( ) .",
    "in order to translate color information into constraints on the underlying ages and abundances of the stellar populations , the color gradients must be compared with stellar population synthesis models . in their most basic form , commonly referred to as simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , these models provide evolutionary information for a coeval population of stars born with a given composition and initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the closest physical analog to such ssps are globular cluster systems from which the ssp models are calibrated ( e.g.  schiavon et al .",
    "several such ssp models have been produced by a number of independent groups and are in a constant state of modification as improvements to many of the input parameters ( e.g.  stellar libraries , model atmospheres , convection , mass loss , mixing ) come to light .",
    "there are discrepancies among the different models that , depending on the application , may result in significantly different interpretations of observations of unresolved stellar populations . in order to determine if these model discrepancies could affect our analysis ,",
    "we have compared two independent sets of ssps ; the 2003 implementation of the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models ( hereafter referred to as galaxev ) , and the project dtude des galaxies par synthse volutive ( pegase 2.0 ) models of fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) .",
    "the stellar populations of interest here are those of spiral galaxies spanning the full hubble sequence ( s0irr ) .",
    "the approximation of a single evolved stellar population clearly does not apply to evolved , complex stellar populations of spiral galaxies .",
    "however , if one assumes that galaxies are composed of a superposition of ssps , born at different epochs , rates , and metallicities , one can use the ssps to develop model grids that mimic the range of plausible galactic stellar populations and these can be compared with galaxy color profiles .",
    "the stellar population model grids are created by taking the single burst ssps , with constant stellar imf and fixed metallicity , and convolving them with a given sfh .",
    "a few simplifying assumptions are inherent in this formulation .",
    "we are assuming that the imf does not change as a function of time or galactic environment .",
    "the validity of this assumption may be questioned from a theoretical perspective as the imf is expected to vary systematically with star formation environments ( chabrier 2003 , and references therein ) . however",
    ", significant observational evidence of star formation in small molecular clouds , rich and dense massive star - clusters , as well as ancient metal - poor stellar populations , reveals a remarkable uniformity of the imf ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "the use of fixed - metallicity ssp implies no chemical evolution .",
    "this is clearly an unrealistic assumption with regards to galaxy evolution ( as it also ignores feedback effects from stellar winds and supernovae ) , but it still allows us a reasonable comparison of _ relative _ metallicities and ages within and among galaxies ( abraham et al .",
    "1999 ; bdj00 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the specific choice of imf , parameterized as @xmath46 , can also potentially affect our results . to gauge the importance of this effect on our color - based analysis we compared model grids obtained with some of the most widely used imf characterizations ; ( a ) the single - slope salpeter ( 1955 ) with    @xmath47    \\(b ) the kroupa ( 2001 ) imf ( pegase models only ) with :    @xmath48    and ( c ) the chabrier ( 2003 ) single - star galactic disk imf ( galaxev models only ) which is parameterized as :    @xmath49 , & $ 0.1 \\le m / m_{\\odot } \\le 1 $ ; \\cr m^{-1.3 } , & $ 1 < m / m_{\\odot } \\le 100 $ } \\label{eq : chab}\\ ] ]    the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf is preferred over the kroupa ( 2001 ) and salpeter ( 1955 ) imfs because of its better agreement with number counts of brown dwarfs in the galactic disk and its theoretical motivation .",
    "the integrated spectrum , @xmath50 , of a stellar population with sfr @xmath51 is computed as the convolution of a single burst stellar population of given metallicity , @xmath52 , with the given sfr :    @xmath53    the left panel in figure  [ fig : tracks_imf ] compares the model tracks from the galaxev models with the salpeter ( 1955 ) ( eq .  [ eq : salp ] ) and chabrier ( 2003 ) ( eq .",
    "[ eq : chab ] ) imfs , and the right panel compares those from the pegase models for salpeter ( 1955 ) and kroupa ( 2001 ) ( eq .",
    "[ eq : kroupa01 ] ) imfs .",
    "the difference between the various imfs on the model grids are small , thus the specific choice of imf ( within current observational constraints ) will not affect our results .",
    "we opt to use the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf for the remainder of this analysis ( primarily to facilitate comparison with other studies ) .",
    "also over - plotted in the right panel of figure  [ fig : tracks_imf ] are the galaxev model with salpeter imf tracks for direct comparison with the pegase model tracks for the same imf ( although note that the upper mass cut - off is 100  m@xmath54 in the galaxev models and 125  m@xmath54 in the pegase models ) .",
    "while differences in the grids between the different models are noticeable ( most likely due to different treatments of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase , see e.g. maraston 2003 ) , they are only significant in the bluest regions where the sb errors of our observations are also large ( i.e.  the outer regions of our spiral galaxies where sky subtraction errors become large , are , for the most part , bluer ) .",
    "slight differences in the age and metallicity gradients would be inferred using the different models , but we are mainly interested in relative quantities , and thus are not concerned with the small absolute differences between models . for the rest of this analysis",
    "we refer only to the galaxev models .",
    "we have explored two different sfr regimes , both parameterized by a star formation timescale @xmath55 .",
    "the first is the simple exponential sfr , @xmath56 ,    @xmath57    where    @xmath58    the second is the so - called `` sandage '' sfr , @xmath59 first parameterized by sandage ( 1985 ) ,    @xmath60    and    @xmath61    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are normalization constants ( to 1 m@xmath64 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_time ] shows the time evolution of the exponential ( top panel ) and sandage sfrs ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the exponential sfr falls off at a given rate for all positive values of @xmath55 .",
    "however , in order to cover the full color - color space spanned by the observations , negative values of @xmath55 were also included which allow for increasing sfrs .",
    "the sandage sfr is characterized by a delayed rise in the sfr , followed by an exponential decline , the rate of which is determined by the value of @xmath55 . for values of @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the age of the galaxy ( fixed to 13 gyr in this work ) ,",
    "the sfr is still rising at the present time .",
    "the average age of a stellar population of a given @xmath55 is computed as :    @xmath67    for the exponential sfr , this equates to ,    @xmath68    and for the sandage sfr ,    @xmath69    figure  [ fig : tracks_sfh ] shows the resulting model grids for the exponential ( blue ) , and sandage ( red ) sfrs overlaid on each other .",
    "lines of constant average age @xmath70 are the dashed , roughly vertical lines ( labeled in gyr ) , while lines of constant metallicity are solid and run closer to the horizontal ( labeled in z , the mass fraction in elements heavier than helium , where z@xmath71 ) .",
    "the overall shape of the two model grids are quite similar , the main difference being that the sandage sfh has a younger average age for a given @xmath72 and the metallicity is slightly higher for a given @xmath73 .",
    "the sandage grids also cover a wider range in ages ( which would increase the magnitude of our measured age gradients ) .",
    "the reported radial age gradients inferred from color gradients ( e.g.  bdj00 ) seem to be at odds with the lack of age gradient observed in open clusters of the galaxy ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "would it be possible that the apparent radial age gradients observed in spiral galaxies are simply due to small amounts of young frostings of star formation on top of an underlying old population ? in order to test for such effects in our age determinations , we produced new model grids for the same underlying sfh but with an additional burst of star formation at different times and fractional masses .",
    "the burst was added as a sandage ( 1985 ) type profile ( eq .  [ eq : sandage ] ) with @xmath74 .",
    "the average age for the models with a burst superimposed on the underlying sfr is now computed as ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the mass fraction of the burst , @xmath77 is the time since the burst , i.e.  the burst of star formation occurs @xmath77 gyr before the current age of the galaxy , @xmath66 , and @xmath78 . figures  [ fig : tracks_burst1 ] and [ fig : tracks_burst2 ] demonstrate the effect of such a burst of star formation superimposed on an underlying exponential sfr with ages ( @xmath77 ) of 1 and 4 gyr respectively .",
    "the left panel in both figures shows the effect if 10% of the galaxy s total mass was involved in the burst , and the right panel shows a 50% ( by mass ) burst .",
    "the models certainly do not cover the same extent in the color - color space for recent bursts . with only 10% of the total galaxy mass in the burst ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks_burst1 ] ; left panel ) the grid does not extend to the red as far as those without bursts .",
    "the effect is strongest ( @xmath0 0.3 mag ) in the optical colors .",
    "also , the burst grid does not extend as far into the blue optical colors ( @xmath8 0.1 mag ) for the most metal - rich galaxies .",
    "this is because we are essentially adding more older stars to the sfhs that are rising at 13 gyr ( @xmath79 for @xmath80 , or @xmath81 gyr for @xmath82 ; this effect is stronger at higher metallicity because the evolution of @xmath72 color with time steepens for higher metallicity stellar populations at ages @xmath0 13 gyr in the galaxev models . )",
    "the lines of constant age also steepen .",

    "( ii ) : :    dust can not be ruled out as a contributor to color gradients in spiral    galaxies , although it is unlikely that the gradients are largely due    to dust extinction .",
    "( iii ) : :    age and metallicity correlate strongly with local surface brightness :    higher sb regions tend to be older and more metal - rich ( see    fig .  [",
    "fig : az_mu ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the local potential plays a    significant role in the sfh of spiral galaxies .",
    "( iv ) : :    age and metallicity , measured at an effective radius of    1@xmath29 , increase with earlier hubble type ,    @xmath142 , @xmath28 ,    and @xmath141 but the trends flatten for    @xmath157 , @xmath145    mag , @xmath1 , and    @xmath158 mag    arcsec@xmath22 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : aeff][fig : zeff_hvrot ] &    [ fig : azeff_morph ] ) .",
    "age also correlates weakly with scale length ( with    scatter decreasing with galaxy size , see right plot of    fig .",
    "[ fig : aeff_hvrot ] ) .",
    "( v ) : :    age and , to a lesser extent , metallicity gradients show radial    structure , with generally steeper gradients in the inner parts of the    galaxy .",
    "care must thus be taken when defining the gradient fit region    ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : age_r][fig : da_mu0 ] ) .",
    "( vi ) : :    age gradients , as measured as a function of scale length , show    correlations with luminosity , size , and rotational velocity    ( fig .",
    "[ fig : da_bd ] ) , especially in the inner disk .",
    "trends in    metallicity gradients with galaxy parameters are weaker    ( figs .",
    "[ fig : dlogz_bd ] & [ fig : dlogz_hvrot ] ) .",
    "( vii ) : :    age gradients do not correlate with csb , contrary to the findings of    bdj00 , which we attribute to inconsistencies in their fit radii ( see    left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : da_bd ] ) .",
    "this is not at odds with statement    ( iii ) since @xmath30 and @xmath29 are not strongly    correlated .",
    "these observations are consistent with a picture where ( i ) higher surface brightness regions of galaxies formed their stars earlier than lower surface brightness regions , or at a similar epoch but on shorter timescales , and ( ii ) the sfhs at a given sb level , which lead to age gradients , are modulated by the overall potential of the galaxy such that brighter / higher rotational velocity galaxies formed earlier .",
    "these trends reach saturation for the brightest and highest csb galaxies .",
    "an earlier formation time for more massive galaxies is clearly in conflict with hierarchical galaxy formation which predicts that more massive galaxies form late .",
    "this discrepancy could be remedied if there is a mechanism at work that prevents the gas in lower mass galaxies from cooling and forming stars at early times .",
    "feedback processes are often invoked as a possible solution , but no prescription has been found thus far that agrees with all observational constraints ( e.g.  kauffmann et al .  2003 ; bell et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in a related manner ,",
    "the semi - analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation of kauffman ( 1996 ) predict a correlation between bulge - to - disk ratio and luminosity - weighted age , such that the bulges of late - type spirals should be older ( up to @xmath159 gyr ) than those of early - type spirals , although this correlation could be erased by any significant inflow from the disk after the last major merger .",
    "figure  [ fig : azeff_morph ] ( left ) shows a strong correlation of effective age with galaxy type , but in the opposite sense of kauffmann s prediction ; later - type galaxies have systematically younger effective ages . clearly , mixing by a bar",
    "could erase the predicted age trend .",
    "if bars trigger radial flows the gradients of strongly barred galaxies would be flat ( the flattening would occur on short enough timescales ) . to look for such mixing effects , we plot age and metallicity gradients as a function of barredness in figure  [ fig : daz_bar ] .",
    "no trends are seen when the gradients are plotted in scale lengths , but against kpc , the strongly barred galaxies may have smaller age gradients ( inner and outer ) , though this observation is based on small statistics .",
    "this agrees with martin & roy ( 1994 ) who found similar flattening of o / h metallicity gradients with bar strength ( their trend also disappears when the gradients are plotted in scale lengths ) .",
    "thus , under all assumptions , our observations can not be reproduced by the kauffmann ( 1996 ) models .",
    "the same model deficiency responsible for the backwards age - size correlation , as compared against observations , could also be the cause of the discrepancy in bulge morphology versus age seen in the kauffmann ( 1996 ) models .",
    "prantzos & boissier ( 2000 ; hereafter pb00 ) present chemo - spectrophotometric models of spiral galaxy evolution .",
    "they adopt a schmidt - type law for the sfr , which is proportional to the gas surface density and varies with galactocentric radius ( dynamical time ) , assume an inflow rate ( of unenriched gas ) that decreases exponentially with time and increases with surface density and galaxy mass , and assume that the gas settles into an exponential disk ( bulges are not modeled ) , but do not consider radial flows ( e.g.  by viscosity which could create gradients , or due to a bar which could flatten radial gradients on small timescales ) .",
    "the star formation efficiency and infall rate are free parameters tuned to match the milky way observational constraints .",
    "the models are then extended to other disk galaxies by adopting the cold dark matter(cdm)-based scaling relations of mo , mao , & white ( 1998 ) .",
    "as such , their galaxy disk radial profiles are fully described by just two parameters : rotational velocity , @xmath28 ( assuming a constant disk - to - halo mass ratio ) , and the halo spin parameter , @xmath160 .",
    "a third parameter describing the formation redshift would be required for a description fully consistent with the cdm hierarchical models of galaxy formation but , as of yet , there is no clear definition for the time of formation for an individual galaxy .",
    "hence , pb00 assume that all galaxies started forming at the same epoch ( 13.5 gyr ago ) but evolve at different rates .",
    "the pb00 models give predictions for o / h abundances and gradients that as could be measured in bright regions in nearby galaxies .",
    "note that o / h determinations in regions probe the present - day ism abundances and are insensitive to abundance evolution with time . still , their model predictions and observations of o / h gradients can be compared , at least indirectly , to our stellar luminosity weighted gradients .",
    "pb00 find that the absolute central abundance for a given @xmath161 correlates with @xmath28 ( and total magnitude ) such that faster rotators have larger central abundances , but the trend saturates for @xmath162 .",
    "furthermore , at a given @xmath28 , the central abundance decreases with increasing @xmath160 but again saturates for galaxies with @xmath162  above which central abundances are high , regardless of @xmath160 . by extension",
    ", we should see a trend of increasing central abundance with @xmath28 , with significant spread ( larger at lower @xmath28 ) due to different values of @xmath160 , but this trend would flatten and show less dispersion above @xmath162 . this is roughly what figures  [ fig : zeff ] &  [ fig : zeff_hvrot ] show for the effective metallicity at the half - light radius versus m@xmath163 and @xmath28 ( central values are too uncertain due to likely higher concentrations of dust and seeing mismatches , and pb00 s models do not consider bulges ) . unfortunately , our galaxies do not exceed @xmath164 , but the general trend above , including the decrease in scatter with @xmath28 , is confirmed .",
    "the right side of figure  [ fig : dlogz_bd ] shows our measured metallicity gradients as a function of total galaxy magnitude ; gradients in disk scale lengths are shown in the upper panels while gradients in kpc are shown underneath .",
    "the left and right panels show the `` inner '' and `` outer '' gradients respectively . when plotted against scale length , the inner or outer gradients show no clear trends .",
    "however , when plotted in kpc , a trend emerges such that brighter galaxies have smaller gradients . since scale length increases with luminosity",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : galpars ] ) , the correlation goes away when the gradients are measured per disk scale length .",
    "if this effect is real , the disappearance of a trend of metallicity gradients in units of scale length may suggest a self - similar pattern in disk galaxies . as suggested by combes ( 1998 ) , a `` universal '' slope per disk scale length",
    "might be explained by the viscous disk models of lin & pringle ( 1987 ) , although model predictions are not conclusive as of yet .",
    "the garnett et al .  ( 1997 ) compilation of o / h gradients shows a similar signature , where abundance gradients in dex / kpc are steeper and exhibit greater scatter for lower luminosity disks , but this trend goes away when gradients are expressed in dex/@xmath29 .",
    "note , however , that the abundance gradients compiled in van zee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and reported in pb00 do show a clear increase with magnitude when plotted as dex/@xmath29 , thus thwarting the interpretation of a universal abundance gradient per scale length .",
    "we have measured compelling trends for the effective age and metallicity in spiral galaxies and their inner and outer disk gradients as a function of surface brightness , luminosity , rotational velocity , and size .",
    "these trends are not well reproduced by current semi - analytical models of galaxy evolution but will undoubtedly serve as effective constraints for future models .",
    "an important limitation inherent in our color - based analysis is its sensitivity to dust extinction which could mimic gradients in age and , particularly , metallicity .",
    "a spectroscopic analysis of radially resolved line indices of spiral galaxies is underway in order to alleviate this problem .",
    "line widths were collected from various sources in the literature ; courteau ( 1997 ) [ 7gals ] ; bottinelli et al .",
    "( 1990 ) [ 74 gals ] ; theureau et al .",
    "( 1998 ) [ 11 gals ] ; haynes et al .",

    "the conversions between the fully corrected line widths are as follows :        haynes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) give a different measure of the line width denoted @xmath169 and defined as the full width between the velocity channels at the 50% level of each horn .",

    "( 1990 ) @xmath165s for galaxies in common reveals little difference , and we assume here that @xmath171 values for the lsbs also map directly into @xmath165 .",
