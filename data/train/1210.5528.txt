    "statistical comparisons of `` class i only '' and `` class ii only '' egos based on our data are limited by the small sample sizes .",
    "it is notable , however , that the nh@xmath1(2,2 ) and h@xmath0o maser detection rates towards these subsamples are comparable , particularly considering the small number statistics .",
    "likewise , figures  [ nh3_prop_meth_colors_fig ] and [ liso_meth_color_fig ] show no clear patterns in their nh@xmath1 or h@xmath0o maser properties that would suggest a trend in evolutionary state .",
    "the parameter space occupied by class i - only and class ii - only sources in these plots also largely overlaps with that occupied by egos associated with both ch@xmath1oh maser types .",
    "though the comparison is again limited by small - number statistics , the difference in the nh@xmath1(3,3 ) detection rates ( 63%/14% for class i / ii - only sources ) is intriguing , particularly given the association of class i ch@xmath1oh and nh@xmath1(3,3 ) masers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "progress in our understanding of masers as evolutionary indicators for msf requires identifying candidate youngest sources , and studying them in detail .",
    "the ( small ) samples of egos with h@xmath0o+class i ch@xmath1oh and h@xmath0o+class ii ch@xmath1oh masers identified in our survey will be promising targets for such studies , as will the samples of h@xmath0o - only , class i ch@xmath1oh - only , and class ii ch@xmath1oh - only sources .",
    "sensitive , high - resolution maser observations are needed : ( 1 ) to localize the maser emission , and determine whether or not all maser species are associated with the same myso and ( 2 ) to search for weak masers and establish whether maser types undetected in single - dish surveys are truly absent .",
    "the expanded capabilities of the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) are well - suited to such studies .",
    "high - resolution cm-(sub)mm wavelength line and continuum observations will also constrain the properties of compact cores ( temperature , density , mass , chemistry ) and outflows , allowing maser activity to be correlated with other signposts of star formation at the scale of individual active sources .",
    "we have surveyed all 94 glimpse egos visible from the northern hemisphere ( @xmath11820@xmath11 ) in h@xmath0o maser and nh@xmath1(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) emission with the nobeyama 45-m telescope .",
    "our results provide strong evidence that egos , as a population , are associated with dense gas and active star formation , and also reveal statistically significant variation amongst ego subsamples :    * h@xmath0o masers , which are associated with outflows and require high densities ( n(h@xmath0)@xmath310@xmath23 - 10@xmath24 @xmath22 ) , are detected towards @xmath368% of egos surveyed .",
    "* the nh@xmath1(1,1 ) detection rate is @xmath397% , confirming that egos are associated with dense molecular gas .",
    "* two - component models provide a significantly improved fit for @xmath323% of our nh@xmath1 spectra , indicating contributions from both warm inner regions and cooler envelopes along the line of sight . *",
    "h@xmath0o maser emission",
    "is strongly correlated with the presence of warm , dense gas , as indicated by emission in the higher - excitation nh@xmath1 transitions .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser detection rate is 81% towards egos detected in nh@xmath1(2,2 ) and/or ( 3,3 ) emission , and only 44% towards egos detected only in nh@xmath1(1,1 ) .",
    "we find statistically significant differences in the distributions of nh@xmath1 column density , kinetic temperature , and nh@xmath1 linewidth for egos with / without h@xmath0o maser detections : egos with detected h@xmath0o masers have greater median n(nh@xmath1 ) , t@xmath61 , and @xmath38 .",
    "maser and nh@xmath1(2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) detection rates are higher towards egos classified as `` likely '' outflow candidates based on their mir morphology than towards egos classified as `` possible '' outflow candidates",
    ". however , statistical tests show significant differences only in the distributions of the nh@xmath1(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) peaks ( t@xmath60 ) , not in physical properties .",
    "* egos associated with irdcs have higher nh@xmath1(2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) detection rates , but a lower h@xmath0o maser detection rate , than egos not associated with irdcs .",
    "we find statistically significant differences in the distributions of nh@xmath1(1,1 ) peak ( t@xmath60 ) , nh@xmath1 linewidth , and nh@xmath1 beam filling fraction for egos associated / not associated with irdcs : the median nh@xmath1(1,1 ) t@xmath119 is higher , and the median @xmath38 lower , for egos associated with irdcs . * the h@xmath0o maser , nh@xmath1(2,2 ) , and nh@xmath1(3,3 ) detection rates towards egos with both class i and ii ch@xmath1oh masers are the highest of any ego subsample we consider : 95% , 90% and 81% , respectively .",
    "in contrast , we detect h@xmath0o masers and the higher - excitation nh@xmath1 lines towards only 33% ( h@xmath0o ) , 20% ( 2,2 ) and 7% ( 3,3 ) of egos with neither type of ch@xmath1oh maser .",
    "we find statistically significant differences in the distributions of nh@xmath1(1,1 ) peak temperature ( t@xmath60 ) , nh@xmath1 column density , and nh@xmath1 linewidth for egos associated with both types / neither type of ch@xmath1oh masers : egos associated with both class i and ii ch@xmath1oh masers have higher median nh@xmath1(1,1 ) t@xmath60 , n(nh@xmath1 ) , @xmath38 , and t@xmath61 . * while h@xmath0o maser detection rates vary across ego subsamples , we find no evidence for statistically significant differences in the properties of detected h@xmath0o masers .",
    "our h@xmath0o maser and nh@xmath1 survey , in combination with the 1.1 mm continuum bgps , provides the necessary data to explore connections between h@xmath0o maser and clump properties : h@xmath0o maser spectra , clump - scale t@xmath61 measurements from nh@xmath1 , and clump masses and densities from the 1.1 mm dust continuum emission and t@xmath61 measurements .",
    "these combined data show no correlation between isotropic h@xmath0o maser luminosity and volume - averaged clump density .",
    "maser luminosity is weakly positively correlated with clump temperature and with clump mass , consistent with reported correlations between h@xmath0o maser luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of the driving source .",
    "we interpret the observed correlations of h@xmath0o maser and clump properties in terms of the relationship between a clump and the massive star(s ) it forms . for more evolved sources ( uc hiis ) ,",
    "studies indicate that higher - mass clumps form higher - mass ( and thus more luminous ) stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for an actively accreting myso",
    ", the available mass reservoir sets the limit on its final , stellar mass .",
    "the more luminous ( and massive ) an myso , the more energy it will impart to its environs , and the more it will heat the gas and dust of the surrounding clump .    we find that nh@xmath1(2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) emission , h@xmath0o masers , and class i and ii ch@xmath1oh masers are strongly correlated , at least on the scales probed by single - dish surveys .",
    "these star formation indicators pinpoint egos in which the central myso(s ) are substantially affecting their environments , more effectively than mir indicators ( such as the `` likely''/possible  classification of or the presence / absence of irdcs ) .",
    "we also identify small samples of egos associated with only one maser type ; the h@xmath0o - only and class i ch@xmath1oh - only sources are candidates for extremely young mysos . constructing an evolutionary scheme for mysos requires localizing maser and dense gas emission at the scale of individual ( proto)stars .",
