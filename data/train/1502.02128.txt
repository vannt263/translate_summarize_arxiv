    "roughly speaking , randomness is the fact that , even using all the information that we have about a physical system , in some situations it is impossible , or unfeasible , for us to predict exactly what will be the future state of that system .",
    "randomness is a facet of nature that is ubiquitous and very influential in our and other societies @xcite . as a consequence , it is also an essential aspect of our science and technology .",
    "the related research theme , that was motivated initially mainly by gambling and led eventually to probability theory @xcite , is nowadays a crucial part of many different fields of study such as computational simulations , information theory , cryptography , statistical estimation , system identification , and many others @xcite .",
    "one rapid - growing area of research for which randomness is a key concept is the maturing field of quantum information science ( qis ) .",
    "our main aim in this interdisciplinary field is understanding how quantum systems can be harnessed in order to use all nature s potentialities for information storage , processing , transmission , and protection @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics @xcite is one of the present fundamental theories of nature .",
    "the essential mathematical object in this theory is the density operator ( or density matrix ) @xmath1 .",
    "it embodies all our knowledge about the preparation of the system , i.e. , about its state . from the mathematical point of view , a density matrix is simply a positive semi - definite matrix ( notation : @xmath2 ) with trace equal to one ( @xmath3 ) . such kind of matrix can be written as @xmath4 , which is known as the spectral decomposition of @xmath1 . in the last equation",
    "@xmath5 is the projector ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath9dimensional identity matrix ) on the vector subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath10 of @xmath1 . from the positivity of @xmath1",
    "follows that , besides it being hermitian and hence having real eigenvalues , its eigenvalues are also non - negative , @xmath11 .",
    "once the trace function is base independent , the eigenvalues of @xmath1 must sum up to one , @xmath12 .",
    "thus we see that the set @xmath13 possesses all the features that define a probability distribution ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the generation of pseudo - random quantum states is an essential tool for inquires in qis ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) and involves two parts .",
    "the first one is the generation of pseudo - random sets of projectors @xmath14 , that can be cast in terms of the creation of pseudo - random unitary matrices .",
    "there are several methods for accomplishing this last task @xcite , whose details shall not be discussed here . here",
    "we will address the second part , which is the generation of pseudo - random discrete probability distributions @xcite , dubbed here as pseudo - random probability vectors ( prpv ) .    in this article",
    "we go into the details of three methods for generating numerically prpv .",
    "we present the problem details in sec .",
    "[ sec_problem ] . the sec .",
    "[ sec_iid ] is devoted to present a simple method , the iid method , and to show that it is not useful for the task regarded in this article . in sec .",
    "[ sec_norm ] the standard normalization method is discussed .",
    "the bias of the prpv appearing in its naive - direct implementation is highlighted . a simple solution to this problem via random shuffling of the prpv components",
    "is then presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec_trigo ] we consider the trigonometric method .",
    "after discussing some issues regarding its biasing and numerical implementation , we study and compare the probability distribution generated and the computer time required by the last two methods when the dimension of the prpv is varied .",
    "the conclusions and prospects are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "by definition , a discrete probability distribution @xcite is a set of non - negative real numbers , @xmath15 that sum up to one , @xmath16 in this article we will utilize the numbers @xmath17 as the components of a probability vector @xmath18    despite the nonexistence of consensus regarding the meaning of probabilities @xcite , here we can consider @xmath17 simply as the relative frequency with which a particular value @xmath19 of a physical observable modeled by a random variable @xmath20 is obtained in measurements of that observable under appropriate conditions .",
    "we would like to generate numerically a pseudo - random probability vector @xmath21 whose components @xmath22 form a probability distribution , i.e. , respect eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prob1 ] ) and ( [ eq : prob2 ] ) .",
    "in addition we would like the prpv to be unbiased , i.e. , the components of @xmath21 must have similar probability distributions . a necessary condition for fulfilling this last requisite",
    "is that the average value of @xmath17 ( notation : @xmath23 ) becomes closer to @xmath24 as the number of prpv generated becomes large .    at the outset",
    "we will need a pseudo - random number generator ( prng ) . in this article",
    "we use the mersenne twister prng @xcite , that yields pseudo - random numbers ( prn ) with uniform distribution in the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "we observe however that the results reported in article can be applied straightforwardly also when dealing with true random numbers @xcite .",
    "a simple way to generate an unbiased pseudo - random probability vector @xmath0 is as follows . if we create @xmath26 _ independent _ pseudo - random numbers @xmath19 with _ identical _ probability _ distributions _ in the interval @xmath25 $ ] ( so the name of the method ) and set @xmath27 we will obtain a well defined discrete probability distribution , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "besides , as @xmath21 is unbiased , the mean value of @xmath17 approaches @xmath24 as the number of samples grows .",
    "for one million random samples generated using the iid method . in the inset",
    "is shown the probability distribution for the components of the probability vector @xmath30 . ]    nevertheless , we should note that the sum @xmath31 shall be typically greater than one .",
    "this in turn will lead to the impossibility for the occurrence of prpvs with one of its components equal ( or even close ) to one . as can be seem in fig .",
    "[ fig_stat_prob_dist_iid ] , this problem becomes more and more important as @xmath26 increases .",
    "therefore , this kind of drawback totally precludes the applicability of the iid method for the task regarded in this article .",
    "lets us begin our discussion of this method by considering a probability vector with dimension @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "if the prng is used to obtain @xmath34 $ ] and we impose the normalization to get @xmath35 , we are guaranteed to generate an uniform distribution for @xmath36 $ ] for both @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    if @xmath39 then @xmath40 and the prng is used again ( two times ) to obtain @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "note that the interval for @xmath42 was changed because of the _ normalization _ of the probability distribution , which is also used to write @xmath43 . as @xmath44 is equiprobable in @xmath25 $ ] ,",
    "for a large number of samples of the prpv , its mean value will be @xmath45 .",
    "this shall restrict the values of the other components of @xmath21 , shifting the `` center '' of their probability distributions to @xmath46 , biasing thus the prpv .",
    "of course , if one increases the dimension of the prpv , the same effect continues to be observed , as is illustrated in the table below for @xmath47 prpv generated for each value of @xmath26 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as was the case with the normalization method , for the trigonometric method we need to generate @xmath48 prn per prpv , @xmath49 for the angles and @xmath49 for the random permutation . nevertheless , because of the additional multiplications in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trig_param ] ) , the computation time for the last method is in general a little greater than that for the former , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_time_d ] .    .",
    "the calculations were realized using a processor 1.3 ghz intel core i5 . ]",
    "one may wonder if the normalization and trigonometric methods , that are at first sight distinct , lead to the same probability distributions for the prpv s components and also if they produce an uniform distribution for the generated points in the probability hyperplane .",
    "we provide some evidences for positive answers for both questions in figs .",
    "[ fig_comparison ] and [ fig_sample_prob_space ] , respectively .    .",
    "we see that the two methods yield , for all practical purposes , the same probability distributions for the components of the prpv . ]    , with exception of the slight overpopulated corners , we get a fairly uniform distribution of points in the probability space . ]",
    "in this article we discussed thoroughly three methods for generating pseudo - random discrete probability distributions .",
    "we showed that the iid method is not a suitable choice for the problem studied here and identified some difficulties for the numerical implementation of the trigonometric method .",
    "the fact that in a direct application of both the normalization and trigonometric methods one shall generate biased probability vectors was emphasized .",
    "then the shuffling of the pseudo - random probability vector components was shown to solve this problem at the cost of the generation of additional @xmath49 pseudo - random numbers for each prpv .",
    "it is worthwhile recalling that pure quantum states in @xmath50 can be written in terms of the computational basis @xmath51 as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath55 implies that the set @xmath56 is a probability distribution .",
    "thus the results reported in this article are seem to have a rather direct application for the generation of _ unbiased pseudo - random state vectors_.    we observe however that the content presented in this article can be useful not only for the generation of pseudo - random quantum states in quantum information science , but also for stochastic numerical simulations in other areas of science .",
    "an interesting problem for future investigations is with regard to the possibility of decreasing the number of prn , and thus the computer time , required for generating an unbiased prpv .",
