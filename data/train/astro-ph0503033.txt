    "a standard cosmological model has emerged over the past few years which provides an acceptable fit to all the available data  @xcite .",
    "it is often known as the @xmath0cdm model since the two dominate energy density components of the universe at the present epoch are provided by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a cosmological constant , @xmath0 ; their densities relative to the critical density are denoted @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the model also includes a smaller fraction of baryons , given by @xmath10 , and density fluctuations created during an epoch of inflation quantified by an amplitude , @xmath11 , and spectral index , @xmath12 .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe at the present epoch is given by @xmath13 and the optical depth to the epoch of reionization is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the age of the universe , @xmath15 , and the redshift of reionization , @xmath16 , can be computed from these parameters .",
    "unfortunately , the value of @xmath0 required to make this model viable is very much in excess of that which is predicted by standard arguments from particle theory and much , largely unsuccessful , effort as been expended to try and explain the apparent discrepancy between theory and observation .",
    "the important feature of @xmath0 in the observational context is that it is constant in space and time and therefore does not cluster into virialized objects , and that it violates the weak energy condition , @xmath17 if the pressure and density are related @xmath18 , which leads accelerated expansion in the late universe .",
    "the generalized concept of dark energy has been introduced to represent any energy component for which @xmath19 and whose jeans length is sufficiently large to prevent clustering .    a dynamical cosmological constant , often dubbed quintessence , based on scalar fields has been developed  @xcite as a dynamical alternative to @xmath0 and is the most popular dark energy candidate .",
    "if a scalar field , @xmath20 , rolls slowly down a sufficiently shallow potential then a fluid with @xmath21 and a large jeans length can be arranged by a suitable choice of potential . however , in order for the dynamics of the scalar field to be super - damped , the compton wavelength of the field needs to be of order the hubble radius today which implies that the mass must be @xmath22 .",
    "such small values of @xmath23 are difficult to achieve within particle physics models due to the effects of quantum corrections  @xcite and such light particles would naturally couple to the fields of the standard model of particle physics  @xcite . while it provides an interesting phenomenological model for dark energy , in many ways quintessence provides no better micro - physical motivation than @xmath0 .    the dark energy can not be a perfect fluid since the sound speed @xmath24 is given by@xmath25 which is @xmath26 leading to instabilities on the smallest scales .",
    "a suggestion  @xcite has been made that the inclusion of rigidity , @xmath27 , in the fluid , making it an elastic solid , could provide the necessary stability . by definition",
    "a solid not only supports longitudinal ( scalar ) perturbations , but also transverse ( vector ) perturbations .",
    "the sound speed of these vector modes is given by @xmath28 and it can be shown that  @xcite @xmath29 this equation implies that if @xmath30 is sufficiently large then @xmath31 even if @xmath21 . apart from their role in stabilizing the scalar modes , we will not consider the possible effects of these vector modes here , leaving their detailed exploration to a future publication  @xcite .",
    "the solid dark matter / energy ( sde ) model was first motivated by the desire to model the effects of a lattice configuration of non - abelian cosmic strings  @xcite , or domain walls  @xcite which would behave like an elastic solid on the scales relevant to cosmological perturbations . on dimensional grounds , the density of static cosmic strings scales as @xmath32 and that for domain walls is given by @xmath33 .",
    "hence , they are natural candidates for dark energy with @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively . recently",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that under some reasonable , but not totally general , circumstances @xmath36 for static dirac - nambu - goto strings and domain walls providing sufficient rigidity to achieve stability in both cases .",
    "hence , @xmath37 represents the cosmic string model and @xmath38 domain walls . what is not totally obvious is that the model presented in ref",
    ".  @xcite , for the which the scalar sector of perturbations is completely specified by @xmath1 , also naturally models a @xmath0 fluid with @xmath4 and cdm with @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the inclusion of these two parameters provides a parameterization of constant dark energy models with four interesting special cases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdm ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is constrain this parameterization using a range of cosmological observations .",
    "an important feature of dark energy models with @xmath40 is that , in order to make accurate predictions , one has to model the perturbations  @xcite .",
    "this has been studied in the context of models based on a scalar field by a number of authors  @xcite . in the synchronous gauge and for constant @xmath41 , the perturbations in an elastic solid satisfy  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43",
    ", @xmath44 is the trace of the spatial metric perturbation and the anisotropic stress is given by @xmath45\\,.\\ ] ] @xmath46 is the change in the anisotropic part of the spatial metric component since the time when the perturbations were created , which in the case the adiabatic perturbations under consideration here is conformal time @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that these expression revert to those of a perfect fluid when @xmath48 and , in particular , they model a cdm fluid @xmath49 .",
    "we will denote the energy density in the sde relative to critical as @xmath50 and for @xmath4 this will correspond to @xmath9 .    the equations were incorporated into camb  @xcite , which is a modified version of cmbfast  @xcite , and this was extensively tested .",
    "we note that the viability of topological defect models has been considered before in ref.@xcite , where it was argued that the perturbations in sde would behave like those in quintessence and therefore used the perturbation model of ref.@xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , this is true near @xmath4 , but becomes a poor approximation near @xmath34 .",
    "this was then incorporated into the october 2004 version of cosmomc  @xcite in order to create markov - chain - monte - carlo ( mcmc ) chains which were used to estimate the confidence limits on the cosmological parameters .",
    "up to 8 parameters were used in the fit and these were chosen to correspond to some of the known degenerate directions in the cosmological parameter space .",
    "in particular , we used @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath12 , @xmath41 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 the acoustic scale defined by the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at the redshift of recombination .",
    "the intrinsic flat priors , listed in table [ flatpriors ] , were chosen to be sufficient broad to incorporate the lines of degeneracy known to exist within the space of parameters and so that the maxima were far from the edges .",
    "[ flatpriors ]    .table of flat priors .",
    "the notation @xmath57 for a particular parameter gives the lower and upper bounds allowed in the fit .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath58 are also bounded by the constraint that @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is the lowest value of @xmath41 allowed by this constraint .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have also assessed whether the inclusion of extra parameters in models ii , iii and iv are justified by the akaike  @xcite and bayesian inference criteria  @xcite , aic and bic respectively , as suggested in ref .",
    "the definitions are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number of parameters in the model .",
    "if one computes these statistics for models with different numbers of parameters , constrained by the same data , then the one with the lowest value of the statistic is preferred .",
    "this can be used to justify the necessity for the extra parameters included in the fit , although the fact that there are two different statistics prevents one coming to totally unequivocal conclusions !",
    "it is clear that the improvement in @xmath2 for a bic is much larger since it requires an improvement of @xmath64 for each parameter added , whereas the aic only requires an improvement of @xmath65 .",
    "the results presented in tables ii , iii , iv and v are somewhat inconclusive with aic and bic leading to somewhat contradictory conclusions .",
    "for example , using the cmb + 2dfgrs data model ii does considerably better than model i with respect to aic , but the opposite is true for bic . however , there is some evidence that model iv which has one extra parameter would be selected over model i by both aic and bic .",
    "clearly more specialized tests would be required to come to an unequivocal conclusion on this issue .",
    "an issue which we have not addressed in this paper is the possibility of intrinsic anisotropy due to the structure of sde .",
    "our equations of motion for the sde implicitly assume that the distribution of the sde is initially isotropic , and hence the elasticity tensor is specified by two moduli , the bulk modulus ( which is related to @xmath41 ) and the rigidity modulus @xmath27 .",
    "it is likely that sde models based on cosmic strings and domain walls will have point symmetry which will require additional moduli .",
    "it is possible that these could lead to a reduction in the large angular scale cmb anisotropies and the intrinsic alignment believed to exist between different multipoles  @xcite .",
    "consideration of these effects could further improve the fits of these models to the current data and we are currently exploring this .",
    "we would like to thank brandon carter and elie chachoua for their collaboration on earlier work which motivated this study .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed using cobra ( http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/cobra ) at jodrell bank observatory .",
    "we thank the staff and the other users of this facility for their assistance .",
    "we would like to thank anthony lewis for making camb and cosmomc publically available ."
