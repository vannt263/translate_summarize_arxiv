    "since hubble ( @xcite ) , galaxy number counts have been widely used as a statistical tool for probing the distant universe , with the hope of constraining both its geometry and the evolution of its content .",
    "modern , high efficiency instruments and detectors reach impressive magnitude limits in the optical : @xmath4 ( tyson @xcite , metcalfe et  al .",
    "@xcite , smail et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , although on a limited area . galaxy counts done at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath2 ) are equally useful ; their interpretation is much less model - dependant because of the smaller lookback - times and weaker cosmological effects .",
    "they thus constitute the link between models and deeper counts by providing a normalisation of both space densities and colours at low redshift .",
    "the problem with bright galaxy counts is that they obviously require substantial solid angles to be surveyed in order to provide statistically significant samples . until very recently",
    ", such areas could only be surveyed in a reasonable time using photographic schmidt plates . since the mid - eighties ,",
    "fast microdensitometers coupled with image analysis computer programs have been employed to produce automatically highly complete catalogs from large areas of the high galactic latitude sky like the cosmos ( heydon - dumbleton et  al .",

    "@xcite ) galaxy surveys .",
    "the main difficulty when dealing with photographic material concerns flux measurements .",
    "many scientific issues typically require the systematic errors to be kept @xmath5  mag .. this is quite a difficult task to achieve on large scales , and can be reached only if a large number of _ galaxy _ standards per schmidt plate , over the whole magnitude range of the counts , are observed to calibrate the data ( metcalfe et  al .",
    "having such a high density of photometric standards is practically not possible with very large schmidt plate surveys , because of the huge observing time it would require .",
    "the catalogs extracted from these surveys are therefore likely to be hampered by systematic errors in their photometry , rather than by limited statistics .",
    "in this paper we re - examine galaxy number counts in the blue and red photographic passbands over the magnitude range @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "our surveyed area is modest ( 140 sq .",
    "deg . ) , but has been carefully calibrated using a fair density of ccd standards ( @xmath7 , half of them beeing galaxies ) , as an attempt to keep photometric systematic errors @xmath5  mag .",
    "_ over the whole magnitude domain _ of the survey .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in  [ par : dataproc ] , as well as the general data processing .",
    "the galaxy number counts are derived and compared to previous studies in  [ par : numbercounts ] .",
    "model predictions about number counts and galaxy colour distributions are tested in  [ par : modcomp ] .",
    "we finally discuss the implications of our results in  [ par : discuss ] .",
    "our optical catalog was originally built as part of a program of identification of faint iras sources on schmidt plates ( bertin , in preparation ) near both ecliptic poles .",
    "the 7 selected fields are characterized by a very low infrared cirrus emission , which ensures that the interstellar extinction is negligible in the visible .",
    "their coordinates are given in table  [ tab : fields ] .",
    "to each field corresponds one plate in the blue photographic passband , and one in the red .",
    "northern plates were taken in france at the cerga 0.9 m schmidt telescope , while southern ones are copies from the eso and serc surveys .",

    "the apparent rapid increase in number counts of galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath8 reported by maddox et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) is thus absent from our counts ( or those of weir et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , although our slope of @xmath9 is still slightly higher than what predict no - evolution models at @xmath10 . as the comparison with the apm data seems to indicate , this might be essentially due to a difference in magnitude scale of @xmath11  0.1 - 0.2  mag./magnitude .",
    "serious suspicions about systematic residual errors in the apm magnitudes at @xmath12 have recently been raised by metcalfe et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) . if our data are correct , they support and even strengthen this hypothesis .",
    "other arguments also consolidate this idea .    first , our data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : galcol ] ) , as well as previous ones ( see koo & kron @xcite ) , do not present evidence for evolution of galaxy colours over the range @xmath13 . and rule out strong luminosity evolution scenarios in the visible ( mcleod & rieke @xcite ) for bright field galaxies , out to @xmath3 .",
    "one might also think of a `` giant local void '' that would affect the bright end of the counts . although there are indications of large fluctuations in projected galaxy density at the level of a schmidt field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multicounts ] , picard @xcite ) for @xmath14 , or over the full sky for @xmath15 ( paturel et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , the analysis of a large spectroscopic subsample ( loveday et  al .",
    "@xcite ) seems to exclude this possiblity in the apm survey .",
    "statistics of ccd calibrations ( maddox et  al .",
    "@xcite , loveday et  al .",
    "@xcite ) done on the apm magnitudes do not reveal any important trend like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : apmcompare ] and [ fig : apmstandcomp ] .",
    "this is quite puzzling , and one might wonder if the effects seen here are not purely local and compensated somewhere else in the apm survey . if this were true , correlated systematic magnitude errors of @xmath16  mag .",
    ", over such large areas ( 100 sq",
    ".  deg . in our case ) would artificially boost the two - point correlation function on scales @xmath17 in @xmath18 magnitude bins .",
    "this does not appear prominently in fig . 2 of maddox ( @xcite ) .",
    "another clue is that the trend found by metcalfe et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) concerns the whole area of the apm catalog , and therefore supports the hypothesis of a global magnitude scale error ( which does not exclude large scale variations of the zero - point ) .      to partially bypass uncertainties in the optimum schechter parameters of the local luminosity function for field galaxies",
    ", count models are generally `` renormalized '' by adjusting the schechter density parameter @xmath19 to counts at some bright magnitude . however , the @xmath20 parameter itself is directly affected by any systematic error in the magnitude zero - point of a redshift survey .",
    "such errors are known to exist at bright magnitudes in photographic catalogs ( metcalfe @xcite , yasuda et  al .",
    "@xcite ) on which are essentially based all the determinations of the local field luminosity function .",
    "in fact , decreasing the @xmath20 found by lpem by about 0.4  mag . , like our photometric comparison with the apm catalog suggests , brings their luminosity function in good agreement with both the one from eep and our bright galaxy counts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : countmodcomp ] ) , without having to increase @xmath19 .",
    "one should also note that such a``bright '' normalisation in @xmath20 of the luminosity function removes any significant luminosity evolution of luminous galaxies in the blue band to @xmath21 ( lonsdale & chokshi @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented a new photometric survey of bright galaxies with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . comparison with our own ccd galaxy standards , as well as others from the literature , allowed us to estimate systematic errors in the photometry to be @xmath5  mag over the whole magnitude range of the survey .",
    "our data reveal no evidence of strong galaxy evolution as had been reported by maddox et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) with the apm survey , although the slope of our number counts is still somewhat higher than what is predicted by no - evolution models brightward @xmath24 .",
    "a comparison with the apm data and other arguments suggest that the apm catalog is affected by a large magnitude scale error , underestimating by about 0.4 mag the flux of galaxies with @xmath25 .",
    "this would then justify the choice of a `` high '' normalization of the field luminosity function ( concerning @xmath20 as well as @xmath19 ) already used by several authors to improve the fit of models at @xmath26 ( e.g. metcalfe et  al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , glazebrook et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "but , given the difficulties inherent to photographic photometry , it would be good to confirm our analysis with linear detectors in order to conclude definitively .",
    "forthcoming digital large scale surveys like the sdss ( e.g. kent @xcite ) should provide this possibility .",
    "we thank the team from cerga , especially d.albanese and c.pollas for providing the northern schmidt plates ; the mama team , especially r.  chesnel and o.  moreau for their high - quality scans ; p.fouqu for enlightning discussions about the local universe and galaxy photometric systems ; j.  loveday and g.  dalton for providing the apm comparison subsamples ; and our referee for useful suggestions ."
