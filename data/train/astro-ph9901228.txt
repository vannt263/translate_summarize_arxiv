    "for many purposes it is important to know whether an object is a single star or a binary .",
    "there are many conventional methods to detect the binary nature of an object : direct imaging methods ( from visual inspection to speckle observations ) , photometric methods ( eclipsing binaries ) , and detection of orbital motions ( spectroscopic and astrometric binaries ) .",
    "the high measuring accuracy of the esa astrometry satellite hipparcos has added some new methods for detecting binaries , which lead to the component ( c ) solutions , acceleration ( g ) solutions , variability - induced movers ( v solutions ) , and stochastic ( x ) solutions , in addition to the classical orbital ( o ) solutions ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "we discuss here an additional method to detect the binary nature of an apparently single star : the new method is based on the comparison of the quasi - instantaneously measured hipparcos proper motion with a time - averaged , long - term proper motion derived either from ground - based observations alone or from a combination of old ground - based positions with the hipparcos position . the basic idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . for a truly single star ,",
    "the proper motion measured within a short interval of time should agree , within the measuring accuracy , with the proper motion derived from a very long interval .",
    "this is in general not true for a binary : due to the wavy orbital motion of the photo - center of an unresolved astrometric binary , the instantaneously measured proper motion of the object can differ significantly from a long - term proper motion ( ideally the motion of its center - of - mass ) .",
    "we have called the difference between the two proper motions the ` cosmic error ' of the instantaneous proper motion ( wielen 1995a , b , 1997 , wielen et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "if we detect for an object an individual cosmic error which is significantly larger than the measuring error , then this object is very probably a binary .",
    "we call these objects ` delta - mu binaries ' ( @xmath0 binaries ) because of the proper - motion difference @xmath0 which has led to the detection of their double - star nature . in the opposite case ,",
    "i.e. if the individual cosmic error is well within the expectation provided by the measuring errors , then the object is either actually a single star or the orbital motion of the photo - center was too small to be detected with the given measuring accuracy .",
    "we call such an object a ` single - star candidate ' , if there is nothing known to us that actually indicates a binary nature of this object ( either from ground - based observations or from hipparcos data ) . there remains , of course , the third possibility : the cosmic error is neither large enough for qualifying the star as a @xmath0 binary nor small enough for a single - star candidate .",
    "our method is based on the comparison of an ` instantaneously ' measured proper motion with at least one long - term proper motion .",
    "short - term proper motions , @xmath5 , derived from observations over a period of about 3 years around 1991 , are provided by hipparcos ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "there are various possibilities for getting long - term proper motions .",
    "let us start with the fk5 ( fricke et al .",
    "1988 , 1991 ) .",
    "this catalogue of fundamental stars provides rather accurate long - term proper motions , @xmath6 , derived from ground - based observations which cover periods of up to more than 200 years .",
    "the fk5 gives also mean stellar positions , @xmath7 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath8 for either the right ascension @xmath9 or the declination @xmath4 of the star .",
    "the individual ` central ' epoch @xmath10 is chosen such that @xmath11 and @xmath6 are not correlated . from the hipparcos position , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , and the fk5 position , we can derive a second long - term proper motion @xmath14 : @xmath15 the epoch difference @xmath16 is typically of the order of 40 years .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath6 are uncorrelated , this is also true for @xmath14 and @xmath6 .",
    "the same is true for the pair @xmath14 and @xmath5 , if we use the individual central epochs @xmath17 for each star and for the two directions @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "the values @xmath6 and @xmath11 should not be taken directly from the fk5 , since the catalogue values are affected by systematic errors .",
    "instead we have first to reduce the positions and proper motions given in the fk5 to the hipparcos system ( see e.g. wielen 1997 , wielen et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 , based on the method of bien et al .",
    "( 1978 ) ) . in the case of the fk5 we can now form the differences for the three pairs of the three proper motions , separately for each coordinate component @xmath18 and @xmath4 . for @xmath19",
    ", we get @xmath20 and three similar equations for @xmath4 . the differences in the two directions @xmath9 and @xmath4 can be added together to a ` total ' difference : @xmath21 and similar equations for the pairs @xmath22 and @xmath23 . because the central epochs @xmath24 are usually different for @xmath9 and @xmath4 , the difference @xmath25 is not strictly a proper - motion difference for a certain epoch .",
    "this complicates slightly the physical interpretation of @xmath25 . but any choice of a common epoch for @xmath9 and @xmath4 would introduce correlations which would disturb our statistical considerations in sect .",
    "3 .    already for the fk5 , the proper motion @xmath14 is usually more accurately measured than @xmath6 .",
    "this is due to the rather good accuracy of old ground - based observations coupled with their high epoch difference with respect to hipparcos .",
    "an important compilation catalogue of such older observations is the gc ( boss et al .",
    "the gc contains many more stars ( 33342 ) than the fk5 ( 4652 ) , albeit with lower accuracy .",
    "unfortunately the proper motions , @xmath26 , given in the gc have such large measuring errors that they can not be used for our purpose in most cases . however , the proper motion @xmath27 , based on the gc position @xmath28 at @xmath29 , @xmath30 is usually accurate enough for being used in our method .",
    "since we have now only two proper motions , @xmath27 and @xmath5 , for a comparison , our formerly three pairs of proper - motion differences are reduced to one difference in the case of the gc : @xmath31 and @xmath32 most of the fk5 stars are also contained in the gc . for these common stars ,",
    "a comparison of @xmath33 and @xmath34 provides a partial consistency check .",
    "one should remember , however , that the fk5 and the gc often use the same old observations and differ only in the detailed treatment of these common data .    up to now",
    ", we have implicitely assumed that the coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath4 of a star change linearly in time . in real applications ,",
    "the effects of sphericity and the foreshortening effect have to be taken into account .",
    "this must be done , however , already for the determination of the systematic differences between the fk5 ( or the gc ) and hipparcos .",
    "if we use later always the hipparcos results as reference values , i.e. @xmath35 instead of @xmath11 and @xmath36 instead of @xmath6 , then the non - linear effects are already accounted for to a high degree of approximation .",
    "after having derived in sect . 2 the proper - motion difference for a given star , we have now to decide whether or not this difference is statistically significant with respect to its measuring error .",
    "the measuring error @xmath37 of @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 @xmath40 is the measuring error of @xmath41 , given in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "the measuring error @xmath42 of @xmath43 consists of two parts : @xmath44 the first part is the random ( ` individual ' ) mean error of @xmath45 , provided by the fk5 .",
    "the second part describes the uncertainty of the reduction of the fk5 system of proper motions to the hipparcos system for the star under consideration .",
    "we emphasize that this is not the systematic difference of the fk5 itself , but only the mean error of the determination of this systematic difference .",
    "the mean error @xmath46 of @xmath47 is obtained from @xmath48 @xmath49 is the measuring error of the hipparcos position @xmath12 in @xmath50 , while @xmath51 is the random error of @xmath7 , and @xmath52 is the uncertainty in the reduction of the fk5 system of positions to the hipparcos system for this star .",
    "the measuring errors of the proper - motion differences for the pairs @xmath22 and @xmath23 are then given by @xmath53 the corresponding equations for the coordinate @xmath4 have the same form : @xmath50 is just replaced by @xmath4 . equations ( 10)-(14 ) are applicable when using the fk5 .",
    "equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) can be easily adapted to the case of the gc by replacing @xmath54 by @xmath55 and @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "we have also to take into account that the components @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the hipparcos proper motions are correlated .",
    "the corresponding correlation coefficient @xmath60 is given in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "the components of the ground - based proper motions , @xmath6 or @xmath26 , are not correlated with @xmath5 .",
    "all the correlations of the components of @xmath14 with other quantities are neglected here , since they are usually very small , because the measuring error of the ground - based position @xmath7 is always much larger than that of the hipparcos position @xmath61 .",
    "for the same reason , we neglect the cross - correlations between @xmath62 and @xmath59 , and between @xmath63 and @xmath41 . from the correlation coefficient @xmath64",
    ", we can derive the covariance @xmath1 which is the same for @xmath5 , @xmath33 , and @xmath65 : @xmath66    we shall now discuss the statistical significance of the proper motion difference @xmath33 . the result for",
    "this pair of proper motions is , however , directly adaptable for the two other differences , @xmath65 and @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that the measuring errors in @xmath68 and @xmath69 follow gaussian distributions with mean zero and dispersions @xmath70 and @xmath71 . however , if @xmath72 , the directions of @xmath9 and @xmath4 are generally not the principal axes of the error ellipsoid . instead , these principle axes are rotated with respect to the equatorial system by an angle @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "the angle @xmath73 is derived from @xmath74 with the auxiliary quantity @xmath75 the angle @xmath73 is counted from north towards the east , like a position angle .",
    "the dispersions along the principle axes of the error ellipsoid are then given by @xmath76 the components of the observed proper - motion difference @xmath33 in the system of the principle axes of the error ellipsoid ( directions @xmath73 and @xmath77 ) are @xmath78    instead of discussing now the statistical significance of @xmath79 and @xmath80 separately as two linear problems , it is more suitable to discuss the significance of the vector @xmath33 as a two - dimensional problem . for this purpose , we define the test parameter @xmath81 by @xmath82 in the isotropic case of the measuring errors ( i.e. for @xmath83 = @xmath84 = @xmath85 and @xmath86 = 0 ) , @xmath54 would simply be the ratio between the proper - motion difference @xmath87 and its measuring error @xmath85 .",
    "if the star is not a binary , then the uncorrelated variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 are expected to follow normal distributions with mean zero and dispersions according to eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 20 ) . in this case , the probability @xmath90 to find by chance a value of @xmath81 which is equal to or larger than the observed value ( given by eq .",
    "( 23 ) ) , is @xmath91 the differential probability @xmath92 to find @xmath81 between @xmath54 and @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 the function @xmath95 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 . for small",
    "@xmath96 increases linearly with @xmath54 .",
    "the function @xmath95 reaches a maximum at @xmath97 , and declines rapidly for larger values of @xmath54 .",
    "we conclude from the run of the function @xmath98 that a high observed value of @xmath81 is a strong indication for the binary nature of the object under consideration . which minimal value @xmath99 for @xmath81",
    "should be used for our @xmath0 binaries ? we propose to call those objects @xmath0",
    "_ binaries _ for which @xmath100 holds .",
    "this gives the same level of significance , @xmath101 as the often used , two - sided 3@xmath102 criterion for a one - dimensional normal distribution .",
    "it means that among 10000 truly single stars , only 27 of them would be wrongly classified by us as @xmath0 binaries .",
    "our proposed value of 3.44 has also been adopted for the @xmath103 solutions in the hipparcos catalogue .    while a large observed value of @xmath81 hints strongly to a binary nature of the object , a small value of @xmath81 makes it rather probable that the star is either single or that its orbital motion is below the level set by the measuring accuracy of @xmath33 .",
    "we propose to call objects with @xmath104 _ single - star candidates_. this limit corresponds to a @xmath105 criterion , @xmath106 from 20 truly single stars , 19 of them would be correctly classified as single - star candidates .",
    "one of them would be wrongly dismissed . in general",
    ", it is impossible to say how many actual binaries are wrongly classified as single - star candidates .",
    "this depends on the measuring accuracy of the proper - motion difference and on the distribution function of the orbital velocities of the binaries .",
    "we should therefore strongly emphasize the word ` candidate ' in our term ` single - star candidate ' .    in the case of the gc",
    ", we have only one meaningful test parameter , namely @xmath107 . for the fk5 , however , three test parameters are available : @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "they are , of course , not independent , since the proper - motion differences are related by @xmath110 . while there are various possibilities to combine the three proper - motion differences into a single test parameter , we propose to call an object a ` @xmath0 binary ' if _ at least one _ @xmath54 value , either @xmath111 or @xmath81 or @xmath109 , is larger than @xmath99 . for a ` single - star candidate ' , _ all _",
    "the @xmath54 values should be smaller than @xmath112 .",
    "the reasons for this choice will become clearer by the discussion in the next section .",
    "the types of binaries which can be detected depend , of course , on the nature and quality of the available astrometric data .",
    "we concentrate here on the cases fk5+hipparcos and gc+hipparcos",
    ".    since hipparcos proper motions and positions are already averages over about 3 years of observations , short - period binaries with orbital periods @xmath113 below 3 years should not be detectable by our method .    for binaries with medium periods of a few decades ,",
    "say @xmath114 years , the hipparcos proper motion @xmath5 is essentially an instantaneous value , while the other proper motions @xmath115 can be considered as mean proper motions , close to the center - of - mass motion of the binary .",
    "such double stars can be detected by their large values of @xmath65 and @xmath33 which fully contain the orbital motion of the binary .",
    "the difference @xmath67 between the two _ mean _ proper motions @xmath14 and @xmath6 should be small for such medium periods .",
    "double stars with long periods , say with @xmath116 years , can also be detected by our method , if the measuring accuracy is high enough with respect to the orbital motion of the photo - center .",
    "this is sometimes the case for nearby objects . for long - period binaries ,",
    "all the three proper motions are essentially ` instantaneously ' measured values : @xmath5 at @xmath117 at about @xmath10 , and @xmath14 at about @xmath118 .",
    "the exact epochs of @xmath6 and @xmath14 are uncertain because the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 are derived from many ground - based catalogues which are spread over a long interval of time , e.g. more than 200 years in the case of the basic fk5 .",
    "on the other hand , in these determinations the more recent catalogues have entered with much higher weights than the old catalogues .",
    "for the long - period binaries , the photo - center moves approximately on a curve of second order in time .",
    "using @xmath17 as the reference epoch in the taylor series , we may write : @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the ( constant ) acceleration of the photo - center in this coordinate .",
    "we obtain then @xmath122 since @xmath123 we find @xmath124 and @xmath125 hence @xmath126 this means that @xmath65 is most sensitive to the binary nature of the object for long - period double stars .",
    "can we decide on the basis of our observed proper - motion differences whether the binary has a medium period or a long one ? for the gc this is impossible , since we have only one quantity , @xmath127 , available . for the fk5 ,",
    "the situation is better .",
    "a long - period binary should fulfill approximately the relation between the three proper - motion differences according to eq .",
    "( 36 ) , both in @xmath50 and @xmath4 . for a binary of medium period and with a small cosmic error @xmath128 in the hipparcos position @xmath12",
    ", we expect a small value of @xmath67 , so that @xmath129 . for some binaries of medium periods ,",
    "the cosmic error @xmath128 may not be negligible with respect to the measuring error @xmath130 of @xmath7 .",
    "assuming that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are long - term , mean quantities , we can derive the cosmic error @xmath128 by @xmath131    in some cases , our method seems to detect also short - period binaries , with @xmath132 1 - 3 years . due to the finite number and the sometimes uneven distribution in time of the hipparcos observations ,",
    "the hipparcos proper motion @xmath5 of such short - period binaries can deviate from the mean proper motion ( e.g. characterized by @xmath6 ) by a significant amount , even if derived from observations spread over 3 years .",
    "the sensitivity of our method is primarily determined by the astrometric accuracy , measured in milliarcsec ( mas)/year . for astrophysical considerations it is more appropriate to translate the proper - motion difference @xmath0 into a velocity difference @xmath133 , measured in km / s : @xmath134 = 4.74 \\ , \\delta\\mu \\ , [ { \\rm mas / year}]\\,/\\,p \\ , [ { \\rm mas } ] \\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the parallax of the star .",

    "we have presented a new method to detect double stars : our @xmath0 method is based on a comparison of the hipparcos proper motions with ground - based data provided e.g. by the fk5 or the gc .",
    "we therefore call these newly detected double stars @xmath0 binaries.    if the hipparcos proper motion of a star is in good agreement with the ground - based data and if no other indications for a binary nature of the object exist , then we classify the star as a single - star candidate.    for nearby stars , our @xmath0 method is very sensitive : at a distance of e.g. 10 pc , our measuring accuracy of orbital velocities is of the order of 50 m / s for basic fk5 stars , and of 80 m / s for many gc stars .    for the detected @xmath0 binaries we obtain statistical estimates for the separation @xmath293 and for the magnitude difference @xmath198 between the components , based on adopted orbital periods",
    "@xmath113 .    our statistical estimates on the parameters of a @xmath0 binary would be significantly improved if accurate radial - velocity measurements would at least provide the acceleration component @xmath294 from the linear change in time of the radial velocity @xmath295 of the double - star component a. of course , such a change would also be a desirable confirmation of the double - star nature of the object .",
    "the sensitivity of and the information provided by the @xmath0 method would be very much increased if a future astrometric satellite ( like the proposed projects gaia , diva , sim ) would reobserve the hipparcos stars . in such a case , a second ` instantaneous ' proper motion at the new epoch and an additional ` intermediate ' proper motion ( based on the two instantaneous positions ) would be available . however , even in this case , the long - term proper motions derived by using ground - based data would remain useful for our @xmath0 method , especially for binaries among the bright stars with longer orbital periods .      in subsequent papers we shall present the individual results of our @xmath0 method for all the appropriate fk5 and gc stars .",

    "<S> . the sensitivity of our method is high : for nearby stars at a distance of 10 pc , the measuring accuracy of the proper - motion difference , expressed as a velocity , is of the order of 50 m / s ( basic fk5 stars ) or 80 m / s ( gc stars ) . at 100 pc , </S>",
