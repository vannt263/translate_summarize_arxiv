    "@xmath157 drops rapidly to zero due to rapid spatial variations in @xmath180.@xcite by measuring how the in - plane magnetic field and layer imbalance affect the interlayer capacitance @xmath135 , it may be possible to estimate the pseudospin stiffness @xmath29 in the commensurate phase , and also to detect the incommensurate phase , as signaled by a rapid decrease in the sensitivity of @xmath135 to @xmath69 and @xmath100 .",
    "it has been shown that the incommensurate phase of a bilayer quantum hall state has a `` rippled '' dipole charge density whenever the layers are unbalanced .",
    "the rippling arises because the layer imbalance @xmath13 and the interlayer phase @xmath123 are coupled through the @xmath13 dependence of the effective tunneling energy @xmath31 and pseudospin stiffness @xmath29 in the pokrovsky - talapov part of the total energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : edensity ] ) .",
    "this coupling between the layer imbalance and interlayer phase produces the rippled state when the translational symmetry of the phase is broken in the incommensurate phase .",
    "the rippled layer imbalance was calculated within the hartree - fock gradient approximation , and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ripple ] .",
    "the details of the calculation are given in the appendix .",
    "we focused on the limit where the interlayer - tunneling energy is smaller than the charging energy of the bilayer ( @xmath95 ) , which is the case for all bilayer samples which have been studied experimentally so far .    because solitons have an associated dipole - moment per unit length ( which we estimated in the appendix ) in the rippled state , well - separated soliton lines experience a power - law ( inverse cube ) repulsive - force per unit length , rather than the much weaker exponentially - decaying repulsion between solitons found in the balanced case .",
    "this has a strong effect on how the density of solitons depends on the in - plane magnetic field near the ci transition , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qs ] .",
    "the fact that solitons have an electric dipole moment in the rippled state makes it likely that they produce anisotropic transport .",
    "transport parallel to the soliton lines ( @xmath181 ) is likely to be easier than transport perpendicular to the soliton lines ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "we expect the ratio @xmath183 to increase when the rippled state is entered .",
    "this could provide an experimental signature for the incommensurate state .",
    "we calculated the interlayer capacitance , specifically the eisenstein ratio @xmath135 , which is a sensitive measure of the electronic compressibility and of interlayer electronic correlations .",
    "when the layers are unbalanced , there is a contribution to @xmath135 which diverges at the ci transition .",
    "however , observing this contribution is likely to be problematic because it requires that the ci transition be very sharp ( unsmeared by disorder ) .",
    "we also calculated a contribution to @xmath135 which does not diverge at the ci transition , but which nevertheless offers a good possibility of experimental detection .",
    "we calculated the in - plane magnetic - field dependence of @xmath135 , along with its dependence on layer imbalance , especially in the commensurate ( @xmath173 ) phase , up to the ci transition ( @xmath69=@xmath76 ) , and discussed its behavior ( rapid decline ) in the incommensurate ( @xmath73 ) phase . by measuring @xmath135 ,",
    "the pseudospin stiffness could be estimated and the incommensurate phase detected .",
    "the existence of `` rippled '' layer densities in the incommensurate phase of unbalanced 2lqh systems is expected to be valid beyond the hfga , although the size of the density variations will be reduced by quantum fluctuations.@xcite as long as the layer densities are `` rippled '' , they will make an anomalous contribution to the capacitance .",
    "although fluctuation effects change the sizes of @xmath29 and @xmath31,@xcite the basic physics of producing `` rippled '' layer densities still holds beyond the hfa .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 and @xmath31 will still change with the layer imbalance @xmath13 , and this dependence on @xmath13 will produce a coupling between @xmath13 and the pseudospin angle @xmath123 , leading to nonuniform @xmath13 in the incommensurate phase when @xmath106 .",
    "several remarks about the observability of the capacitive effects found here are in order , especially the effects of including finite temperature and disorder . in practice , both finite temperature and disorder limit the minimum effective value of @xmath184 that can be obtained .",
    "these are important topics which deserve further study ; only some preliminary considerations are discussed here .    ignoring the effects of disorder for the moment",
    ", it is important to note that the soliton lattice exists only at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the soliton lattice supports a finite - temperature kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition due to dislocation - mediated melting of the lattice of soliton lines.@xcite the kt temperature for melting the soliton lattice is roughly @xmath185 , where @xmath89 is the longitudinal stiffness and @xmath186 is the transverse stiffness of the soliton lattice.@xcite because @xmath187 as @xmath91 , the kt temperature drops as the ci transition is approached .",
    "this sets a limit to how close one can get to the ci transition , which may be estimated in the case of finite layer imbalance by using @xmath188 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : newqs ] ) ] and @xmath189.@xcite from these considerations , the requirement that @xmath190 gives @xmath191 for the sample parameters used in the text . for @xmath192=100",
    "mk , this yields @xmath193 .",
    "the smearing of the ci transition due to disorder is more problematic . even in capacitance experiments designed to measure the ( in)compressibility of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) state ( which would , in the absence of disorder , lead to a divergent @xmath135 at odd - denominator filling factors ) , only finite changes in @xmath135 are found at the fqh filling factors , due to the effects of disorder.@xcite it is to be expected that disorder may eliminate any abrupt features in the interlayer capacitance @xmath135 in this case also . strictly speaking ,",
    "the long - range order of the sl is destroyed by any finite amount of disorder;@xcite presumably the sl has only a finite correlation length @xmath194 due to disorder . roughly speaking",
    ", the maximum spacing between solitons ( @xmath78 ) will be limited to @xmath195 , so that @xmath196 in practice , such disorder could arise from small variations in the local tunneling ampitudes @xmath31 or the spin stiffness @xmath29 due to minute variations in the interlayer barrier thickness and/or the layer separation .",
    "more theoretical work needs to be done to determine the limits imposed by disorder , but the issue of the observability of the ci transition in capacitance measurements must be settled experimentally .",
