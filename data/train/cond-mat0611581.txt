    "the pseudomorphic monolayer of fe grown on a w(110 ) surface is very interesting from the point of view of magnetism . in studies of the surface magneto - crystalline anisotropy ,",
    "the fe monolayer on top of a w substrate has become the system of choice , since ( i ) the growth of the first fe monolayer is pseudomorphic , ( ii ) the w substrate has a large spin - orbit coupling , and ( iii ) the interface anisotropy is the strongest ever observed .",
    "this makes the fe monolayer on a w substrate a good candidate for an _ ab initio _ benchmark investigation of how the properties of the magneto - crystalline anisotropyare influenced by the substrate .",
    "depending on the coverage and the surface orientation , fe films on a w substrate show very different magnetic properties . at submonolayer coverages on",
    "the ( 110 ) surface one observes the formation of separate islands that are nonmagnetic up to a coverage of 58 - 60% , beyond which they become ferromagnetic islands,@xcite which may even show an out - of - plane magnetization until they approach the full - monolayer coverage.@xcite a single monolayer ( ml ) of fe can be grown pseudomorphically on top of a w(110 ) surface.@xcite experiments performed on the pseudomorphic fe monolayer@xcite have shown that@xcite `` the prominent magnetic feature of fe(110 ) films on w(110 ) is a strong in - plane magnetic surface anisotropy , with an easy axis [ 1@xmath00 ] at right angles to the bulk easy axis [ 001 ] . '' at coverages of about 1.5 ml , double - layer patches ( sesquilayers ) form with an out - of - plane magnetic easy axis,@xcite and an antiferromagnetic order.@xcite a pseudomorphic full second ml has to our knowledge not been grown experimentally , but theory predicts it would also have an in - plane easy axis in the @xmath2-direction.@xcite attempts of using annealing as a means of making the grown fe layers full monolayers beyond the first monolayer leads to a reorganization of the fe in an fe bulk - like lattice.@xcite for continous layers of fe , the easy axis of magnetization eventually changes to the in - plane [ 001]-direction it has in bulk fe,@xcite the critical thickness of the fe film being reported in the range between 80 and 95   ( 95   reported by ref .  , and",

    ", we should stress that in contrast to the ferromagnetic fe monolayer on the w(110 ) surface stand results of recent studies ( experimental@xcite and _ ab initio_)@xcite of fe films on the ( 001 ) surface of w , which indicate that the first ml of fe is antiferromagnetic when grown on the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "thus , the magnetic properties of the fe monolayer is very sensitive to the surface orientation of the w substrate , and one can not make general conclusions about the magnetic properties of other surfaces on the basis of investigations of only one .    in the present work , we study the substrate effects on the magnetic properties of the pseudomorphic ml of fe(110 ) on w(110 ) from first principles . existing _",
    "ab initio _",
    "calculations performed within the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) method,@xcite the full - potential linearized muffin - tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) method,@xcite as well as pseudo - potential calculations@xcite confirm the above - mentioned experimental ferromagnetic result with an easy axis along the [ 1@xmath00]-direction . at present",
    ", there is no measurable lattice - relaxation effect of the magnetization direction,@xcite and the starting point for the calculations presented in this work is the optimized surface of ref .  .",
    "the main results of our work are magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies that are converged _ ab initio _ as a function of the substrate thickness , along with magnetic spin- and orbital moments that consistently confirm the breaking of hund s 3rd rule for the w substrate .",
    "the quality of the results is illustrated by explicitly showing the convergence , along with an estimate of the accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we describe and discuss the method that we use , in particular with respect to the level of accuracy necessary for the calculation of stable magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies , and in sec .  [ sec : iii ] we present and discuss the results of our calculations , where we focus the attention on the magnetic and electronic properties of the surface , and how the substrate influences these properties . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , we conclude .",
    "since we have the flexibility that a theoretical calculation provides , we do not need to limit ourselves to the experimentally possible .",
    "thus , we are able to take an approach where we begin with a bilayer of fe(110 ) and w(110 ) , successively adding w substrate layers underneath in order to investigate how the the sub - surface layers influences the magnetic and electronic properties at the surface .    in order to facilitate the calculation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies and how they change with the number of substrate layers , one has to perform the calculations with a highly accurate and mature _ ab initio _ computer code .",
    "the demands on accuracy imply that a full - potential code is necessary .",
    "since all _ ab initio _ methods employs an `` educated guess '' for the initial solution , the code _ must _ be self - consistently reaching a stable solution to the eigenvalue problem of the schrdinger equation , e.g. , by use of the rayleigh - ritz@xcite variational approach .",
    "in addition to this , the spin - orbit interaction must be included in the self - consistent solution in order to produce magnetic properties that are accurate enough .",
    "the _ ab initio _ method of choice for our calculations is the full - potential ( partially linearized ) augmented plane - wave [ ( l)apw+lo ] with local orbitals method@xcite as implemented in the wien2k computer code.@xcite    within the wien2k code , one constructs a supercell perpendicular to the surface , ensuring that enough vacuum is inserted between the surface and the border of the unit cell ( in our case the vacuum amounts to at least 16 interlayer distances of the w(110 ) substrate ) . in order to keep the environment of our surface calculation stable",
    ", we let the fe monolayer sit in the middle of the unit cell of constant size , adding the w substrate layers under it .",
    "this choice , of course , limits our possibility for continously adding w substrate layers , but not beyond the practical limits of the code , as we shall see later .    in a study where we begin from the surface layer",
    "we expect to see rather big changes to the electronic and magnetic properties as we add substrate layers to the system , due to the similarities to the properties of a quantum well . as we keep adding substrate layers we expect the properties to stabilize in such a manner that the system starts behaving like a surface layer on a bulk - like substrate .",
    "when this point has been reached , adding another substrate layer should not change the electronic and magnetic properties at the fe surface layer much .    with our demands on the accuracy ,",
    "it is important that the surface is structurally relaxed .",
    "how a single monolayer of fe(110 ) relaxes on top of a w(110 ) substrate has been studied by qian and hbner ( ref .  ) . since their results are very close to experiment,@xcite and since there is no experimentally measurable structural effect due to changes in the direction of magnetization,@xcite we have in the present work chosen to adopt the optimized surface structure of ref .   as the basis for our calculations",
    "we have , however , in order to better describe the influence of the substrate on the surface magnetism , chosen to use a nonsymmetric layered structure instead of the symmetric one of ref .  .",
    "thus , the structure is using the optimized values of the interlayer distances from the surface side as determined in ref .   [ the fe - w1 distance is contracted by 12.9%  and the w1-w2 distance by 0.1% compared to bulk w(110 ) interlayer distances ( w1 and w2 are the first and second w layers under the fe layer , respectively ) ] , but has bulk - spaced w layers underneath .",
    "the fe layer has an in - plane lattice misfit of about 10%  compared to a pure fe(110 ) surface .    in practical _ ab initio",
    "_ calculations within density - functional theory , one has to make a choice of the so - called exchange - correlation potential , since it is not known as an exact quantity .",
    "our calculations within the wien2k computer code are performed using the [ generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ] exchange - correlation potential of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( ref .  ) . in order to facilitate the calculation of magnetic anisotropy energies ( maes ) , the variational parameter , i.e. , the total energy of the _ magnetic _ configuration,@xcite was converged to an accuracy that in most cases is better than 10 @xmath3ry ( for a detailed list of relevant accuracies , consult the results section , in particular tab .",
    "[ t:1 ] ) . also , the fluctuations in the charge density within the unit cell has been converged to less than 10@xmath4 e / bohr@xmath5 . since the abovementioned two convergence criteria",
    "do not automatically ensure that the eigenstates and eigenfunctions are sufficiently accurate , one has in addition to make sure that also the the calculation converges with respect to the parameters that control the accuracy of the calculations of the wien2k code [ in particular the ( kinetic energy ) cutoff value of the otherwise infinite plane - wave basis , and the sampling in * k*-space ] .",
    "as we shall illustrate below , these parameters were adjusted ( increased ) until the magnetic anisotropy energies for an increasing number of w layers stabilized .",
    "the parameter used to control the kinetic energy cutoff of the plane - wave basis depends on the muffin - tin radius used for the atomic part of the ( l)apw basis set as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cutoff parameter , @xmath8 is the muffin - tin radius ( 2.35 bohr in our calculations ) , and @xmath9 corresponds to the plane - wave cutoff ( in ry ) in pseudopotential calculations , e.g. , the value @xmath10 gives a @xmath11 ev .",
    "thus , @xmath7 determines the matrix size of the eigenvalue problem , and higher values of @xmath7 potentially decreases the accuracy of the resulting eigenfunctions and -energies .",
    "when one begins with an fe / w(110 ) bilayer and thereafter add w(110 ) substrate layers ( on the w side of the bilayer ) , one expects that as long as the number of w layers ( called @xmath12 in the following ) is sufficiently small , the system behaves in a quantum - well - like fashion , i.e. , the changes to properties such as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy or the density of states will be large each time a substrate layer is added . at some critical value of @xmath12 , one would expect that the substrate starts behaving like a bulk substrate and , thus , that the fe layer becomes more surface - like in its properties .",
    "below , we discuss how the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies and the electronic structure change as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     tab .",
    "[ t:3 ] lists the magnetic spin- ( @xmath13 ) and orbital ( @xmath14 ) moments per atom for the three different magnetization directions we consider .",
    "first , we notice in general that the magnetic spin moment of the fe atom is enhanced in comparison to the bulk fcc fe value of 2.2 @xmath3b .",
    "second , in all three cases , after peaking at about 2.61 @xmath3b for 3 substrate layers , the fe atom takes on a magnetic spin moment of about 2.56 @xmath3b , and the first w layer under the fe surface layer takes on a moment of about 0.1 @xmath3b in the opposite direction ( hence , it is antiferromagnetically coupled to the fe layer ) , consistent with the result of ref .  .",
    "the remaining magnetic spin moments , including the interstitial moments , are negligible ( less than 1.5%  of the fe moment ) .    looking at the orbital moments in tab .  [ t:3 ] ( @xmath14 ) , we observe that while the spin moments do not change their sign with a change of the magnetization axis , the orbital moments do .",
    "with magnetization along the easy axis ( * m*@xmath15 $ ] ) , the orbital moment of the fe surface layer is very small , and in general couples antiparallel to its spin moment . for the cases with 12 w substrate layers , the orbital moment in the first substrate layer couples",
    "antiparallel to its spin moment ( and parallel to the spin moment of fe ) .",
    "however , already with the addition of the the third substrate layer , the orbital moment of the first substrate layer couples in parallel to its spin moment ( and antiparallel to the fe spin moment ) . for magnetization along the hard axis (",
    "* m*@xmath16 $ ] ) and perpendicular to the surface plane ( * m*@xmath17 $ ] ) , the coupling picture is opposite .",
    "the orbital moment of the fe atom is still very small , but now coupled in parallel to its spin moment , and the orbital moment of the first w substrate layer couples in parallel to its spin moment for the cases with 12 w substrate layers ( and antiparallel to the spin moment of the fe surface layer ) .",
    "the rather large orbital moments of w@xmath18 for @xmath19 and 2 might occur due to the fact that these systems tend to have molecular properties rather than solid - state ones .",
    "they might originate in a combination of the large spin - orbit coupling found in w in combination with the large fe moment . from the addition of the third substrate layer and onwards , the orbital moments of the first w atom couple antiparallel to their spin moments ( and parallel to the fe spin moment ) .",
    "thus , with respect to the orbital moments , we conclude ( i ) that three substrate layers already deliver a converged result , and ( ii ) that in agreement with the observations made by refs  , hund s 3rd rule is broken for the w substrate .    for the perpendicular magnetization direction ( * m*@xmath17 $ ] ) , our results for @xmath14 differs qualitatively from those obtained in ref .  .",
    "in order to explain this difference , a number of calculations were performed on the symmetric slab , based on the hypotheses that the difference is caused by ( i ) instabilities in the computer code , ( ii ) the perturbative final addition of the spin - orbit coupling in ref .  , ( iii ) the amount of `` vacuum '' between the slabs in the supercell calculation , or ( iv ) the breaking of the symmetry in the slab ( removing one of the fe surfaces ) . a repetition of the calculation in ref .",
    "eliminates the first hypothesis .",
    "a comparison between the repeated calculation and one with spin - orbit coupling included selfconsistently leads to elimination of the second hypothesis.@xcite in the symmetric slab , the fe layers may couple electronically to each other either through the w substrate or through the vacuum . in ref .",
    ", the distance through the w substrate is 24.52 bohr , and the distance through the vacuum is 26.01 bohr .",
    "thus , in order to test hypothesis ( iii ) against hypothesis ( iv ) we increase the distance between the two fe layers on the vacuum side to 76.54 bohr.@xcite the result of the calculation with the increased spacing on the vacuum side between the two fe surfaces is [ in support of hypothesis ( iii ) ] an orbital moment for the fe layer of @xmath20 and an orbital moment for the first w layer of @xmath21 , in agreement with tab .",
    "thus , in agreement with refs  , we may conclude from this little excercise on the symmetric slabs and from tab .",
    "[ t:3 ] that both the size as well as the alignment of the orbital moments in the fe surface layer and the first w substrate layer are not only very sensitive to the local structure , but also to the direction of magnetization in the fe layer .    in order to determine the influence of the substrate layers on the electronic properties of the magnetic surface ,",
    "the evolution in the density of states for the d - electrons ( d - dos ) of the fe atom has been plotted in fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] ( easy - axis magnetization , * m*@xmath15 $ ] ) , beginning with the fe / w(110 ) bilayer result in fig .",
    "[ f:2](a ) . in figs .",
    "[ f:2](b)(h ) , the differences due to the addition of a second , third , fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh , and eighth substrate layer , respectively , are depicted on the same scale as the d - dos of the bilayer .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] that the main features of the d - dos of the fe(110 ) surface layer are to be found in a band between 4 ev above and 5 ev below the fermi energy ( @xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] ) . also , we observe from fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] that by adding substrate layers , the changes to the d - dos of the fe surface layer become less and less pronounced , as the number of substrate layers go up . since already after the fourth or fifth substrate layer",
    ", the d - dos of the fe surface layer has converged to within a few percent of what it would be on bulk w(110 ) , the d - dos supports the conclusion that the maes have reached their bulk value after adding 4 - 5 substrate layers .",
    "when the d - dos has converged , the differences in d - dos due to changes in the magnetization direction are very subtle . in order to illustrate this",
    ", we have in fig .",
    "[ f:3](a ) plotted the d - dos of an fe(110 ) monolayer with four w substrate layers underneath it for the three cases where the magnetization direction is along one of the three main crystallographic axes . from fig .",
    "[ f:3](a ) we notice that the d - dos is now almost identical in all three cases . in order to explore the subtle differences in the d - dos between the different magnetization directions , we have in figs .",
    "[ f:3](b)(c ) additionally plotted the differences in the d - dos between the easy axis , the hard axis , and the axis perpendicular to the surface , i.e. , the two quantities d - dos(*m*@xmath15$])@xmath23d - dos(*m*@xmath16 $ ] ) , and d - dos(*m*@xmath15$])@xmath23d - dos(*m*@xmath17 $ ] ) , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the evolution of the d - dos when adding substrate layers , the differences in the d - dos between the different magnetization directions are too small to be plotted on the same scale as the d - dos itself . since the maes are in the mev - range , this is to be expected , since large changes in the d - dos would lead to large maes .",
    "we have shown that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy in an fe(110 ) monolayer on w(110 ) can be converged with respect to the thickness of the substrate using _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "after showing large changes for the first few substrate layers , it stabilized close to 3 mev , close to the experimental value .",
    "in addition , the directions of the easy and hard axes came out consistently , and in - plane . as expected from the large variations in the maes with respect to the addition of the first few substrate layers , also the density of the fe d - states vary a lot during the addition of the first few substrate layers , after which it stabilizes . at the bulk - like substrate thicknesses , the differences between the density of d - states between the different magnetization directions reflects the fact that the mae is in the mev regime ( they are very small ) .",
