    "fine - tuning their properties demands methods capable of quantitative magnetic characterization at lateral resolutions from nano - scale down to a few atoms .",
    "one of such candidate measurement methods is electron magnetic circular dichroism ( emcd ; @xcite ) , a spectroscopic experiment performed using a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) .",
    "emcd as an experimental technique is known for about 10 years . since its inception @xcite it went through a rapid development with significant improvements in spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies provided understanding of the interplay of dynamical diffraction effects and inelastic excitations that give rise to emcd signal @xcite and its relation to the ground state expectation values @xcite such as spin and orbital magnetic moments via sum rules @xcite . although early adopters have already successfully applied this characterization technique in their research @xcite , yet , emcd has not reached a stage of wide adoption as a routine experimental method .",
    "the reasons are two - fold : 1 ) requirement of single - crystalline specimen precisely oriented in a two - beam or three - beam orientation , and 2 ) generally emcd spectra have often a low signal to noise ratio , which is due to the fact that emcd needs to be measured aside the bragg spots .",
    "several approaches have been suggested to overcome the requirement of single - crystalline specimen and specific orientations .",
    "an approach using a boersch plate @xcite was suggested by hasenkopf et al.@xcite .",
    "a convergent beam should be split into two parts , one of which should be phase - shifted by @xmath4 using a coil in the boersch plate .",
    "these two beams would be focused back on the same spot on the sample and via a coherent interference and dynamical diffraction , an emcd signal should appear at thales circle positions@xcite .",
    "to this date , this approach has not been yet successfully implemented .",
    "promising new approach is based on an application of advanced statistical methods to extract the emcd signal , previously theoretically explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this experiment one acquires a large number of core - level spectra in more - or - less random geometrical conditions ( mutually random beam , sample and detector orientations ) and the magnetic and nonmagnetic signal components are separated by a statistical post - processing .",
    "this method was recently successfully applied to a polycrystalline iron film @xcite .",
    "finally , a method based on utilizing electron vortex beams@xcite ( evbs ) has been suggested@xcite .",
    "evbs are typically convergent electron beams that carry a nonzero orbital angular momentum ( oam ) . by measuring an electron energy loss spectrum once using evb with @xmath5 and another one with @xmath6",
    ", a nonzero emcd signal should be obtained as their difference .",
    "because the measurement of the spectrum is done at the transmitted beam , it means significantly stronger intensity ( assuming that we can obtain evb with an intensity comparable to an `` ordinary '' convergent electron beam ) .",
    "originally it was believed that this method will allow to measure emcd without a requirement of single crystals in specific orientations .",
    "follow - up theoretical works discussed the elastic propagation of evbs via vacuum @xcite or crystals @xcite , their inelastic interaction with atoms @xcite or formation @xcite .",
    "experimental works provided new methods of generating evbs @xcite , reducing their diameter @xcite , or measuring their angular momentum.@xcite yes , new measurement of emcd have not appeared in the literature so far .    in our recent work",
    "we have computationally shown that , in fact , utility of evbs for measurement of emcd is limited to measurements at an atomic resolution @xcite . if a thin crystalline layer is oriented in a low index zone axis , then a narrow evb passing through an atomic column will be sensitive to its magnetic properties",
    ". however , if the beam passes in between columns or if its diameter is significantly larger than interatomic spacing , the emcd signal wo nt be detected at the transmitted beam anymore .",
    "very recently , detection of emcd was ruled out for nanoparticles larger than 1  nm@xcite .    in this work",
    "we describe our implementation of a theory of inelastic electron scattering for evb , which is based on a combination of multislice propagation method for the incoming beam and bloch - waves ( bw ) description for the outgoing beam .",
    "the method is built on top of the efficient summation algorithm mats@xcite introduced recently .",
    "mats algorithm performs an efficient filtering and summation of the largest terms in the bloch - waves expression of the double - differential scattering cross - section , containing an 8-fold sum over bloch coefficients.@xcite using this method we explore in detail the inelastic scattering of evbs on crystals as a function of evb diameter , acceleration voltage , starting angular momentum and displacement from an atomic column .",
    "finally , we propose optimized settings for an emcd experiment with vortex beams .",

    "it has been expressed in terms of the radius of a disc describing the beam in @xmath9-space , denoted @xmath8 .",
    "the convergence angle necessary to reach given @xmath8 depends on the acceleration voltage , see fig .",
    "[ fig : convqmax ] .",
    "an advantage of this choice is that the beam diameter , to which @xmath8 translates , does not depend on the acceleration voltage , because the probe wave - function in the real space is obtained directly by fourier transform of the disc .",

    "based on this expression , for a given @xmath12 the resulting wave function shape in the real space is the same for all values of @xmath8 , up to a scaling . by multiplying the diameter of the probe ( using the full - width at half - maximum , fwhm ) with @xmath8 we obtain a dimensionless measure of the beam diameter , which can be conveniently expressed as an universal function of the oam , fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhmxqmax ] . from this figure",
    "one can directly read the beam diameters in bohr radii ( atomic unit , 1  a.u.=0.529178   ) for @xmath13 a.u.@xmath7 , i.e. , the largest value considered here .",

    "inelastic scattering simulations described in the next section are rather time consuming , therefore optimization of computational parameters is of great importance .",
    "major parameters for the elastic multislice part of the simulation@xcite are the sizes of the grids , both within a unit cell and the number of unit cells included in a simulation .",
    "we have adopted a grid of @xmath15 grid points within a single unit cell , which turned out to be sufficient to accurately reproduce a bloch - waves calculation for a plane - wave illumination ( see below ) .",
    "the target maximum thickness in our simulations was 40 nm , which means approximately 140 unit cells of bcc iron ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the number of unit cells in the @xmath17 directions depends sensitively on the beam characteristics . for a plane wave @xmath18",
    "is enough .",
    "but for convergent beams ( with or without angular momentum ) that can only rarely be sufficient  either the beam is too wide to fit into one unit cell , or its convergence angle is so large that the beam quickly spreads , as it propagates through the crystal .",
    "beam characteristics in our simulations are determined by the @xmath8 and @xmath19 parameters defined above .",
    "we have not considered the broadening of the beam due to finite source size , i.e. , we assume purely diffraction - limited beam diameter .",
    "naturally , small values of @xmath8 mean a broad beam , which spreads very slowly , while large values of @xmath8 produce very well focused beams , which however spread quickly as they propagate through the lattice . for actual simulations we have used supercell size @xmath20 , that is a square with approximately 5.7 nm long edge .",
    "the grid size is thus @xmath21 pixels .",
    "all the calculated 3-dimensional probe wavefunctions were stored and serve as an input for the calculations of the double - differential scattering cross - section described in section  [ sec : inel ] .",

    "the picture demonstrates symmetry relations connecting the triangular wedges of the unit cell ( see text for details).,width=325 ]    for calculations of the energy - filtered scans at atomic resolution it is advantageous to use symmetry properties of the crystal structure and relation between the evbs with positive and negative angular momentum . if the magnetization of the sample points in @xmath25-direction , a rotation by 90 degrees along the @xmath25-axis is a symmetry operation for both the beam and the sample .",
    "that means that it is certainly enough to sample only one quarter of the unit cell ( e.g. , the lower left square of dimensions @xmath26 ) and fill in the rest by rotating the square around the center of the cell .",
    "however , we can also utilize the diagonal mirror symmetry operation of the unit cell , if we take into account that a mirror will invert the sign of all axial vectors lying within its symmetry plane  that is both the magnetization vector and the angular momentum of the evb .",
    "in other words , an emcd signal calculated for an evb with @xmath27 with vortex core positioned at @xmath28 will have an opposite sign to an emcd calculated for an evb with @xmath29 passing through @xmath30 .",
    "situation is somewhat different , if magnetization is in - plane , let s say along @xmath31-direction . in such case ,",
    "a rotation by 90 degrees along the @xmath25-axis changes the magnetization vector to plus or minus @xmath32-direction . the action of mirror symmetry planes parallel with @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) crystal axis will invert ( or keep ) the sign of magnetization .",
    "the diagonal axis combines these two effects - the component parallel with mirror axis gets inverted sign and the component perpendicular to the mirror axis stays unchanged . as a result , from magnetization along @xmath31 direction we obtain magnetization along plus or minus @xmath32 direction .",
    "we remind that all these mirror planes also invert the sign of evb angular momentum .    using these symmetry properties ,",
    "it is enough to sample 1/8th of the unit cell area with beams of angular momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 for all three directions of magnetization @xmath23 , and the rest of the unit cell area can be obtained using symmetry operations .",

    "considering values@xcite for a spin moment of iron @xmath117 and number of holes in the @xmath42 shell @xmath118 , the relative strength of the magnetic signal at the iron @xmath119 edge obtained as a difference of the @xmath119 edge signals measured with evbs with oam @xmath120 and @xmath121 divided by their average is about 7% .",
    "we note that it is possible to obtain significantly higher relative magnetic signal fractions @xmath97 , but at the cost of reduced electron counts .",
    "since in the atomic - resolution stem measurements of electron energy - loss spectra ( eels ) have to cope with low electron count rates , optimization of the absolute electron count rates appears to be a more relevant criterion than a relative signal strength .",
    "most suitable would be to optimize signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , but that depends also on the background signal under the core - level spectra , which we ca nt reliably estimate .",
    "if background signal dominates the intensity , then the core - level spectrum is only a small modification of the total electron count at given energy loss . in such case ,",
    "the absolute strength of magnetic signal is practically proportional to the snr , because the noise is mostly determined by slowly varying background .",
    "it has been suggested that evbs with a large starting angular momentum could be more efficient in detecting emcd@xcite .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that for lower or medium acceleration voltages it is most efficient to measure with evb with oam @xmath122 . only at @xmath123  kev or more ,",
    "occassionally we can obtain stronger magnetic signal with @xmath124 .",
    "this advantage however reduces and eventually disappears with increasing thickness @xmath50 . at @xmath125",
    "kev the strength of magnetic signal obtainable with @xmath126 is very close to the maximum value for @xmath127 , which suggests that at even larger acceleration voltages it might be advantageous to work with evbs with @xmath126 or even more .",
    "though for practical purposes , in the range of the most common acceleration voltages it appears that a choice of @xmath91 is optimal .    the optimum at the lowest sample thickness , as mentioned above ,",

    "the absolute magnetic signal strength is quite considerable  being about 60% of the overal optimum .",

    "the evolution of the optimum @xmath8 and @xmath109 is less systematic as a function of the other parameters .",
    "this is probably a consequence of complicated dynamical diffraction effects involved in the process of inelastic scattering of evbs .",
    "generally , for the cases where a reasonably strong magnetic signal can be observed , the @xmath8 typically stays within a range of @xmath131@xmath99  a.u.@xmath7 and the @xmath109 is in the range from @xmath132 to @xmath133 .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have considered an evb passing directly through a column of atoms . in our survey",
    "we have also considered a range of shifts of the evb core from the atomic column .",

    "the obtainable strength of the magnetic signal is reduced mostly by 510% and occassionally up to 20% .",
    "the optimum conditions remain unchanged , only the strength of the signal is reduced by 9.5% .",
    "generally , we conclude that misplacing the beam witin @xmath135   from the atomic column causes only a minor weakening of magnetic signal .    displacing the beam",
    "further to @xmath136   still shows the same qualitative trends , however with significantly reduced strength of the magnetic signal . in most cases",
    "the reduction falls into an interval 2045% . yet",
    ", the magnetic signal keeps the same sign .",
    "thus a measurement of emcd with evbs within in a radius of @xmath137   from the atomic column should still provide a signal with a sizable magnitude .",
    "situation qualitatively changes at a shift of @xmath138   .",
    "the magnetic signal drops to values that reach not more than 12% of the optimum .",
    "the reduction of the magnetic signal seems to be less strong for beams with larger oam . as a consequence , at this displacement , evbs with @xmath127 or even @xmath139",
    "can provide strongest magnetic signal , especially at medium or lower voltages and higher sample thicknesses .",
    "but it should be stressed that here we talk about generally very weak magnetic signal , which especially in terms of relative magnitude barely reaches 1% of the non - magnetic signal . in this context ,",

    "what makes this observation rather unexpected is that the beam itself has a fwhm of @xmath146   , i.e. , substantially larger .",
    "even more surprising it becomes , when we realize that an ordinary convergent beam with zero oam produced at the same conditions has a fwhm of @xmath147   .",
    "in other words , it appears that a magnetic signal measured by an evb with @xmath94 provides very similar spatial resolution as a beam with zero oam in detection of the non - magnetic signal .",
    "the same observation can be made from the energy - filtered high - resolution maps calculated for @xmath92  a.u.@xmath7 published in ref .",
    "thus it is appealing to hypothesize that it could be a systematic phenomenon .",

    "@xcite and recently in ref .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that there should be a link between the ability of the beam to transfer the angular momentum to the sample and its sensitivity to the magnetic properties of the sample . though one can also argue against by noting that the exchange of the angular momentum happens also in the elastic regime , where sample acts as an infinite reservoir and beam changes its angular momentum without noticeable energy loss . moreover , as was already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , even a wide evb exchanges the angular momentum with the sample , despite that its sensitivity to the magnetic properties of sample is negligible . here",

    "we define channeling strength per atomic column as the integrated intensity of electron beam within 1   diameter around an atomic column ( distance of closest atomic columns in bcc iron is @xmath149   ) . we illustrate channeling as a function of beam diameter and position of beam center in fig .",
    "[ fig : channeling]a and [ fig : channeling]b , respectively . clearly , as the beam diameter is reduced , channeling per atomic column increases , because wider beams tend to channel through a larger number of atomic columns than a narrow beam . however , beyond @xmath39  a.u.@xmath7 channeling decays rapidly as the beam passes through the crystal , most likely due to fast spreading of very narrow beams . placing the beam center away from the atomic column",

    "[ fig : channeling]c .",
    "although there is some qualitative similarity ( e.g. , chanelling strength peaking around 1012  nm thickness and then decaying , similar to the emcd strength ) , however , it is not an one to one correlation and an explicit calculation of emcd effect appears to be the only safe option for estimating its strength dependence .",
    "we have systematically explored the elastic and inelastic scattering of the evbs on a bcc iron crystal as a traditional benchmark system for studies of emcd .",
    "optimization of the detector aperture shape suggests to use an annular aperture with an outer radius of @xmath2 or more [ @xmath3 ] and an inner radius of approximately @xmath1 , depending on the angular momentum of the beam and , to some extent , also on acceleration voltage .",
    "the strongest absolute emcd signal for a 10  nm layer of bcc iron was observed for evb passing directly through a column of atoms and having the following parameters : @xmath94 , acceleration voltage 200  kev , and @xmath105  a.u.@xmath7 , which corresponds to a fwhm of 1.6   . under these conditions ,",
    "the emcd signal constitutes about 7% of the white - line intensity at the iron @xmath119 edge . in terms of relative emcd strength",
    "it is possible to obtain higher signal fractions ( over 10% ) , but at the cost of overal lower signal strength , thus sacrificing the measured electron count rate .",
    "emcd signal appears to be well localized nearby the atomic columns and quickly decreases with increasing distance of the vortex core from the atomic column . in the optimal measurement conditions stated above",
    ", the emcd strength drops to about half of its maximum value at a distance of approximately @xmath151   leading to an atomic resolution map of the emcd signal , which has a fwhm of about @xmath145   around atomic columns .",
    "it is worth noting that this is much less than the fwhm of the vortex beam itself , while it is surprisingly close to the fwhm of a beam with @xmath148 obtained in the same conditions .",
    "reasons for this unexpected yet systematic observation are not understood at this point .",
    "increase of the beam angular momentum in majority of cases does not lead to an increase of the emcd strength . on the other hand ,",
    "the beams with larger angular momentum appear to be somewhat less sensitive to a slight displacement of the beam from the atomic column .",
    "still , in terms of the maximum strength of emcd signal , optimal value remains @xmath94 .",
    "for an evb with @xmath94 the acceleration voltage has , similarly as the beam diameter , a non - monotonous influence on the emcd strenth . as stated above , an optimum",
    "is reached around 200  kev .",
    "for evbs with higher starting @xmath19 the strength of emcd slowly increases with acceleration voltage , mostly monotonously . yet , even at 1000  kev , the absolute strength of emcd does not overcome the optimal value for @xmath94 at 200  kev .",
    "thus , increasing of the acceleration voltage is not likely to bring a major advantage in measuring emcd with vortex beams , except for thicker samples : at 40  nm , the optimum settings for evb with @xmath94 are acceleration voltage of 500  kev and @xmath92  a.u.@xmath7 , which is a vortex beam with fwhm of 1.3   .",
    "compared to the 10  nm thickness the loss of the optimal signal strength it about 35% , i.e. , vortex beams may offer a rather efficient route also for thicker samples .",
    "finally , we have found no clear correlations between the @xmath25-dependent angular momentum of the probe and the sensitivity to the magnetic properties . on the other hand",
    ", we found some similarity between the electron channeling and strength of emcd , though it is not a clear correspondence .",
    "hence , to obtain an estimate of the emcd strength , one has to perform an inelastic electron scattering calculation .    in this work",
    "we have not considered an influence of aberrations on the sensitivity of evbs to magnetic properties . without doubts",
    "it is an important aspect for the feasibility of such measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "the optimal settings require relatively narrow probe sizes , which are mostly achieved in aberration corrected microscopes , where the defocus and spherical aberration can be efficiently suppressed .",
    "source size broadening was also not considered here . in terms of high - resolution energy - filtered stem images",
    "this will cause a smearing of the contrast and , because the intensity of the magnetic signal rapidly drops with displacement of the evb from atomic column , the optimal absolute and relative magnitudes of the emcd strength will be correspondingly reduced",
