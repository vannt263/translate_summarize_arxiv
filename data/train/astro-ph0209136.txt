    "when the next galactic supernova occurs , approximately @xmath7 detected neutrino events are expected among the several detectors around the world .",
    "it is widely believed that these @xmath7 events will provide important clues to the astrophysics of the supernova as well as the properties of the neutrinos themselves .",
    "interestingly , recent breakthroughs in understanding solar and atmospheric neutrinos each occurred when the accumulated samples of detected events first exceeded @xmath7 .",
    "but will we have enough information to study the supernova neutrino signal in detail ?",
    "almost all of the detected events will be charged - current @xmath6 , which will be well - measured , both because of the large yield and because the measured positron spectrum is closely related to the neutrino spectrum .",
    "because of the charged - lepton thresholds , the flavors @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 can only be detected in neutral - current reactions , of which the total yield is expected to be approximately @xmath8 events .",
    "however , in general one _ can not _ measure the neutrino energy in neutral - current reactions .",
    "this talk presents an exception .",
    "these four flavors are expected to carry away about 2/3 of the supernova binding energy , and are expected to have a higher temperature than @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "however , there is no experimental basis for these statements , and present numerical models of supernovae can not definitively address these issues either .",
    "if there is no spectral signature for the neutral - current detection reactions , then neither the total energy carried by these flavors nor their temperature can be separately determined from the detected number of events .",
    "but it is crucial that these quantities be _",
    "measured_. both are needed for comparison to numerical supernova models .",
    "the total energy is needed to determine the mass of the neutron star , and the temperature is needed for studies of neutrino oscillations . at present , such studies would suffer from the need to make model - dependent assumptions .",
    "this problem has long been known , but perhaps not widely enough appreciated . in this talk ,",
    "i clarify this problem , and provide a realistic solution that can be implemented in two detectors , kamland ( already operating ) and borexino ( to be operating soon ) .",
    "the solution is based on neutrino - proton elastic scattering , which has never before been shown to be a realistic detection channel for low - energy neutrinos .    in this talk",
    ", i will focus on just the problem of measuring the temperature and total energy of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , since everything else in understanding supernova neutrinos depends on it .",
    "the cross section for neutrino - proton elastic scattering is an important prediction  @xcite of the standard model , and it has been confirmed by extensive measurements at gev energies ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the energies considered here",
    ", the full cross section formula  @xcite can be greatly simplified .",
    "the differential cross section as a function of neutrino energy @xmath11 and struck proton recoil kinetic energy @xmath12 ( and mass @xmath13 ) is @xmath14\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber \\label{diffxs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , we have taken @xmath15 ( i.e. , keeping only the lowest order in @xmath16 , a very good approximation ) ; the full expression was used in the calculations below .",
    "the neutral - current coupling constants between the exchanged @xmath17 and the proton are @xmath18 where the factor 1.27 is determined by neutron beta decay .",
    "the cross section for antineutrinos is obtained by the substitution @xmath19 . as will be emphasized below",
    ", our results are totally independent of oscillations among active flavors , as this is a neutral - current reaction .",
    "we consider only _ free _ proton targets ; the small yield from bound protons creates a small background signal , as discussed in ref .",
    "we use the struck proton kinetic energy in the laboratory frame as our kinematic variable , as appropriate to scintillator detectors . for a neutrino energy @xmath11 , @xmath12 ranges",
    "between 0 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 the maximum is obtained when the neutrino recoils backwards with its original momentum @xmath11 , and thus the proton goes forward with momentum @xmath22 . since @xmath23 , the _",
    "largest _ proton recoils are favored , which is optimal for detection .",
    "in this talk , i characterize the supernova neutrino signal in a very simple way , though consistently with numerical supernova models  @xcite .",
    "the change in gravitational binding energy between the initial stellar core and the final proto - neutron star is about @xmath24 ergs , about @xmath25 of which is carried off by all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos over about 10 s. the emission time is much longer than the light - crossing time of the proto - neutron star because the neutrinos are trapped and must diffuse out , eventually escaping with approximately fermi - dirac spectra characteristic of the surface of last scattering . in the usual model , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and their antiparticles",
    "are emitted with temperature @xmath26 mev , @xmath10 has @xmath27 mev , and @xmath9 has @xmath28 mev .",
    "the temperatures differ from each other because @xmath10 and @xmath9 have charged - current opacities ( in addition to the neutral - current opacities common to all flavors ) , and because the proto - neutron star has more neutrons than protons .",
    "it is generally assumed that each of the six types of neutrino and antineutrino carries away about @xmath29 of the total binding energy , though this has an uncertainty of at least @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be @xmath31 per century ( this is reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the expected number of events ( assuming a hydrogen to carbon ratio of @xmath32 ) is @xmath33 \\left[\\frac{1{\\rm\\ mev}}{t}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\left[\\frac{10{\\rm\\ kpc}}{d}\\right]^2 \\left[\\frac{m_d}{1{\\rm\\ kton}}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{\\langle \\sigma \\rangle}{10^{-42}{\\rm\\ cm^2}}\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( though written slightly differently , this is equivalent to the similar expression in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "we assume @xmath34 kpc , and a detector fiducial mass of 1 kton for kamland . as written , eq .",
    "( [ yield ] ) is for the yield per flavor , assuming that each carries away a portion @xmath35 of the total binding energy ( nominally , @xmath36 ergs , and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the thermally - averaged cross section ( the integral of the cross section with normalized fermi - dirac distribution ) is defined for each @xmath38 `` molecule '' , and a factor of 2 must be included for electron or free proton targets .",
    "prior to ref .",
    "@xcite , the largest expected yield in any oil or water detector was from @xmath6 .",
    "the total cross sections for charged - current @xmath39 and neutral - current @xmath4 have similar forms , though the latter is about 4 times smaller .",
    "however , this is compensated in the yield by the contributions of all six flavors , as well as the higher temperature assumed for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath40 mev instead of 5 mev ) .",
    "thus , the total yield from @xmath4 is _ larger _ than that from @xmath6 , when the detector threshold is neglected .",
    "taking into account radiative , recoil , and weak magnetism corrections , the thermally - averaged cross section for @xmath41 at @xmath42 mev is @xmath43 @xmath44 ( for 2 protons )  @xcite .",
    "these corrections reduce the thermally - averaged cross section by about 20% , and also correct the relation @xmath45 mev .",
    "the total expected yield from this reaction is thus about 310 events in 1 kton .",
    "since the struck protons in @xmath4 have a relatively low - energy recoil spectrum , and since realistic detectors have thresholds , it is crucial to consider the proton spectrum in detail , and not just the total yield of neutrinos that interact .",
    "the elastically - scattered protons will have kinetic energies of a few mev .",
    "obviously , these nonrelativistic protons will be completely invisible in any erenkov detector like super - kamiokande .",
    "however , such small energy depositions can be readily detected in scintillator detectors such as kamland and borexino .",
    "we first consider the true proton spectrum , and then how this spectrum would appear in a realistic detector .     the true proton spectrum in kamland , for a standard supernova at 10 kpc .",

    ". however , our results are _ totally insensitive _ to any oscillations among active neutrinos or antineutrinos ( since this is a neutral - current cross section ) , and also to oscillations between active neutrinos and antineutrinos ( since the cross section is dominated by the @xmath56 terms ) .",
    "thus when we refer to the @xmath9 flavor , we mean `` those neutrinos emitted with a temperature @xmath54 mev , whatever their flavor composition now , '' etc .",
    "the true proton spectra corresponding to the various flavors are shown in fig .",

    "it also reduces the number of events above threshold .",
    "the anticipated threshold in kamland is 0.2 mev electron equivalent energy . with the expected proton quenching",
    ", this corresponds to a threshold on the true proton kinetic energy of 1.2 mev .",
    "the number of events above this threshold for each flavor appears in table  [ tab : numevents ]",

    "this has been convolved with both the differential cross section ( which gives a range of @xmath12 for a given @xmath11 ) , and also the effects of quenching .",

    ".numbers of events in kamland ( 1 kton mass assumed ) above the noted thresholds for a standard supernova at 10 kpc , for the separate flavors or their equivalents after oscillations .",
    "oscillations do not change the number of neutrinos at a given energy , and the neutral - current yields are insensitive to the neutrino flavor .",
    "equipartition among the six flavors is assumed ( see the text for discussion ) .",

    "the total number of detected events is proportional to the portion of the total binding energy carried away by these four flavors , and we denote this by @xmath61 ( note that this is _ not _ the total binding energy @xmath62 ) . for a standard supernova , @xmath63 ergs .",
    "we denote the temperature of these four flavors by @xmath64 .",

    "thus for a given measured number of events , one would only be able to define a hyperbola in the plane of @xmath61 and @xmath64 .",
    "the scaling is less simple here because of threshold effects , but the idea is the same",
    ".    here we have crucial information on the shape of the neutrino spectrum , revealed through the proton spectrum . to remind the reader , in most neutral - current reactions",
    "there is _ no _ information on the neutrino energy , e.g. , one only counts the numbers of thermalized neutron captures , or measures nuclear gamma rays ( the energies of which depend only on nuclear level splittings ) .",
    "we performed quantitative tests of how well the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath64 can be determined from the measured proton spectrum .",
    "( we did also investigate the effects of a chemical potential in the fermi - dirac distribution , but found that it had little effect .",
    "this is simply because the cross section is not rising quickly enough to see the tail of the thermal distribution in detail  @xcite . )",
    "of course , if the distance to the supernova is not known , then we are effectively fitting for @xmath71 .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations of the supernova signal in kamland and made chi - squared fits to determine @xmath61 and @xmath64 for each fake supernova . to perform the fits , we started with an `` ideal '' spectrum , as described by the integral : @xmath72 where the inner integral is as in eq .",

    "eight bins of variable width were used , chosen to contain roughly the same number of expected events per bin . for a chosen @xmath61 and @xmath64 ,",

    "we have shown that neutrino - proton elastic scattering , previously unrecognized as a useful detection reaction for low - energy neutrinos , in fact has a yield for a supernova comparable to @xmath41 , even after taking into account the quenching of the proton scintillation light and assuming a realistic detector threshold .",
    "in addition , the measured proton spectrum is related to the incident neutrino spectrum .",
    "we have shown explicitly that one can separately measure the total energy and temperature of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , each with uncertainty of order 10% in kamland .",

    "the values of @xmath61 and @xmath64 were chosen such that the numbers of events above threshold were the same .",

    ", one could not distinguish between combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath64 along the band in this plane that our three example regions lie along . ]    for borexino , the useful volume for supernova neutrinos is 0.3 kton , and the hydrogen to carbon ratio in the pure pseudocumene ( c@xmath84h@xmath85 ) is @xmath86  @xcite , so there are about 4.7 times fewer free proton targets than assumed for kamland .",
    "however , the quenching is less in pure scintillator ( kamland is about 20% pseudocumene and 80% paraffin oil  @xcite ) , and the errors on @xmath61 and @xmath64 scale as @xmath87 , so that the precision in borexino should be about 20% or better .    other techniques for bolometric measurements of supernova neutrino fluxes have been studied .",
    "detectors for elastic neutral - current neutrino scattering on electrons  @xcite and coherently on whole nuclei  @xcite have been discussed , but never built .",
    "if neutrino oscillations are effective in swapping spectra , then the temperature of the `` hot '' flavors may be revealed in the measured positron spectrum from @xmath6 ; two recent studies have shown very good precision ( @xmath88 ) for measuring the temperatures and the total binding energy  @xcite . however",
    ", they assumed exact energy equipartition among the six neutrino flavors , whereas the uncertainty on equipartition is at least 50%  @xcite . nevertheless , under less restrictive assumptions , this technique may play a complementary role .",
    "finally , since for different cross sections , the neutral - current yields depend differently on temperature , comparison of the yields may provide some information  @xcite .",
    "however , there are caveats . in neutrino - electron scattering",
    ", the neutrino energy is not measured because the neutrino - electron angle is much less than the angular resolution due to multiple scattering .",
    "the scattered electrons , even those in a forward cone , sit on a much larger background of @xmath6 events , so it is difficult to measure their spectrum  @xcite ; also , their total yield is only weakly dependent on temperature . at the other extreme ( see fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the yield of neutral - current events  @xcite on @xmath89o depends strongly on a possible chemical potential term in the thermal distribution .",
    "it is important to note that the detection of recoil protons from _",
    "neutron_-proton elastic scattering at several mev has been routinely accomplished in scintillator detectors ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "since both particles are massive , the proton will typically take half of the neutron energy .",
    "this reaction provides protons in the same energy range as those struck in neutrino - proton elastic scattering with @xmath90 mev .",
    "this is a very important proof of concept for all aspects of the detection of low - energy protons .    though low - energy backgrounds will be challenging , it is also important to note that the background requirements for detecting the supernova signal are approximately 3 orders of magnitude _ less _ stringent than those required for detecting solar neutrinos in the same energy range ( taking quenching into account for our signal ) .",
    "borexino has been designed to detect very low - energy solar neutrinos , and kamland hopes to do so in a later phase of the experiment .",
    "these measurements would be considered in combination with similar measurements for @xmath9 and @xmath10 from charged - current reactions in other detectors .",
    "separate measurements of the total energy and temperature for each flavor will be invaluable for comparing to numerical supernova models  @xcite .",
    "they will also be required to make model - independent studies of the effects of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "if the total energy release @xmath62 in all flavors has been measured , then @xmath91 thus allowing a direct and unique measurement of the newly - formed neutron star properties , principally the mass @xmath92  @xcite .",

    "<S> a long - standing problem in supernova physics is how to measure the total energy and temperature of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . while of the highest importance , this is very difficult because these flavors only have neutral - current detector interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that neutrino - proton elastic scattering , @xmath4 , can be used for the detection of supernova neutrinos in scintillator detectors . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized immediately that the dominant signal is on _ free _ protons . </S>",
    "<S> though the proton recoil kinetic energy spectrum is soft , with @xmath5 , and the scintillation light output from slow , heavily ionizing protons is quenched , the yield above a realistic threshold is nearly as large as that from @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the measured proton spectrum is related to the incident neutrino spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to detect this signal would give detectors like kamland and borexino a crucial and unique role in the quest to detect supernova neutrinos . </S>",
