    "the gaussian free field is widely considered to be a universal object describing the flucutations of heights of random surfaces .",
    "previous work has rigorously shown this to be the case in specific models ( @xcite,@xcite ) . in this paper , we show that if an interlacing particle system in two dimensions can be described as a determinantal point process , and mild assumptions are made about the correlation kernel , then the covariances of the fluctuations of the height function are governed by a particular green s function .",
    "a general formula for the green s function is given .",
    "in particular , we will use this general theorem to show that in an interlacing particle system that arises from the representation theory of the orthogonal groups , the green s function is @xmath0 note that @xmath1 is the green s function for the laplace operator with dirichlet boundary conditions on the set @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that there is a map @xmath3 from the surface to @xmath4 .",
    "we will show that the fluctuations of the height function converge to a gaussian process whose covariance is given by the pullback of @xmath1 under @xmath3 .",
    "* particle system .",
    "* now let us describe this particle system , which was the initial motivation for this paper .",
    "introduce coordinates on the plane as shown in figure [ configur ] .",
    "denote the horizontal coordinates of all particles with vertical coordinate @xmath5 by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "there is a wall on the left side , which forces @xmath8 for @xmath5 odd and @xmath9 for @xmath5 even .",
    "the particles must also satisfy the interlacing conditions @xmath10 for all meaningful values of @xmath11 and @xmath5 .",
    "[ configur ]    by visually observing figure [ configur ] , one can see that the particle system can be interpreted as a stepped surface .",
    "we thus define the height function at a point to be the number of particles to the right of that point .",
    "define a continuous time markov chain as follows .",
    "the initial condition is a single particle configuration where all the particles are as much to the left as possible , i.e. @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "this is illustrated in the left - most iamge in figure [ jumps ] .",
    "now let us describe the evolution .",
    "we say that a particle @xmath14 is blocked on the right if @xmath15 , and it is blocked on the left if @xmath16 ( if the corresponding particle @xmath17 or @xmath18 does not exist , then @xmath14 is not blocked ) .",
    "each particle has two exponential clocks of rate @xmath19 ; all clocks are independent .",
    "one clock is responsible for the right jumps , while the other is responsible for the left jumps .",
    "when the clock rings , the particle tries to jump by 1 in the corresponding direction . if the particle is blocked , then it stays still . if the particle is against the wall ( i.e. @xmath20}=0 $ ] ) and the left jump clock rings ,",
    "the particle is reflected , and it tries to jump to the right instead .    when @xmath14 tries to jump to the right ( and is not blocked on the right ) , we find the largest @xmath21 such that @xmath22 for @xmath23 , and the jump consists of all particles @xmath24 moving to the right by 1 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath14 tries to jump to the left ( and is not blocked on the left ) , we find the largest @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and the jump consists of all particles @xmath28 moving to the left by 1 .    in other words , the particles with smaller upper indices can be thought of as heavier than those with larger upper indices , and the heavier particles block and push the lighter ones so that the interlacing conditions are preserved .",
    "[ jumps ]    figure [ jumps ] depicts three possible first jumps : left clock of @xmath29 rings first ( it gets reflected by the wall ) , then right clock of @xmath30 rings , and then left clock of @xmath29 again .    in terms of the underlying stepped surface",
    ", the evolution can be described by saying that we add possible `` sticks '' with base @xmath31 and arbitrary length of a fixed orientation with rate 1/2 , remove possible `` sticks '' with base @xmath31 and a different orientation with rate 1/2 , and the rate of removing sticks that touch the left border is doubled . cube .",
    "if one uses the dual convention that this is a cube - shaped hole then the orientations of the sticks to be added and removed have to be interchanged , and the tiling representations of the sticks change as well . ]    a computer simulation of this dynamics can be found at + http://www.math.caltech.edu/papers/orth_planch.html[@xmath32 .",
    "this particle system falls in the universality class of the anisotropic kardar - parisi - zhang ( akpz ) equation with a wall .",
    "the kpz equation was first introduced in @xcite and is of interest to physicists , see @xcite .",
    "similar markov chains have been previously studied in @xcite without the wall , and in @xcite with a different ( `` symplectic '' ) interaction with the wall .",
    "* more general particle systems . * by following the proof , the author realized that a more general statement could be proved .",
    "if a point process in a two - dimensional lattice is determinantal , and the correlation kernel can be expressed as a double integral with certain technical assumptions ( see definition [ normal ] below ) , then the moments of the fluctuations of the height function can be governed by a green s function .",
    "the exact statement is theorem [ maintheorem ] .",
    "we then can use this theorem to determine the green s function for the specific point process described above .",
    "* motivations .",
    "* there are three reasons for proving the results in the more general case .",
    "the first reason is that the proofs are not much more difficult .",
    "the second reason is that it is easier to check the conditions for the general case than it is to repeat the full calculations .",
    "the third reason is that the general result tells us that the formula for the green s function only depends on @xmath33 , and therefore should only depend on the horizontal movement of the particles .",
    "for instance , in the model of @xcite , the expression for @xmath1 was explicitly computed . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the particles had two different jump rates , and the expression for @xmath1 was the same .",
    "our general results should imply , for example , that @xmath1 will be the same for any number of different jump rates . in order for a model to have a different expression for @xmath1",
    ", there should be some change along the horizontal direction .",
    "for example , in the model considered in this paper , a reflecting wall is added to the model of @xcite , and we see that @xmath1 is changed .",
    "the correlation kernels in previous problems ( @xcite,@xcite ) should satisfy the conditions of the more general case , although the author has not rigorously checked the details .    *",
    "* there are several statements which should be true , but are not pursued in this paper .",
    "one of them concerns the one - point fluctuations .",
    "namely , after a scaling of @xmath34 , the fluctuations of the height function at a single point should converge in moments to a standard gaussian .",
    "the proof would consist mainly in proving that the variance is proportional to @xmath35 , which by @xcite immediately implies the convergence to a gaussian .",
    "the appropriate scaling was first demonstrated in @xcite using a renormalization group argument . using this convergence",
    ", one can then show that the convergence to the gaussian free field occurs in distribution , not just in moments .",
    "analogous ( rigorous ) statements are found as theorem 1.2 and proposition 5.6 in @xcite .",
    "it should also be possible to prove similar results when @xmath36 , but this was also not pursued .",
