    "disks of spiral galaxies are extremely fragile and must have formed primarily by conversion of gas to stars in an essentially invariant galaxy potential with only a small accretion of external stars ( e.g. , toth & ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "thus , the stellar history of this component may be approximately modelled as the evolution of a single entity , which greatly simplifies predicting the luminosity evolution . in the present letter",
    "we trace the evolution of the distribution of star formation rates in galaxies with redshift to determine whether it is consistent with this type of pure luminosity evolution .",
    "the problem is relatively straightforward because beyond @xmath6 the observed  band corresponds to ultraviolet light ( @xmath7 ) , which in all but the oldest galaxies is a measure of the ongoing rate of massive star formation .",
    "the  luminosity is then directly proportional to the rate of metal production in the individual galaxy , while the contribution of the ensemble of galaxies to the extragalactic background light measures the overall metal density production in the universe ( cowie 1988 ; songaila , cowie , & lilly 1990 ; lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al .",
    "viewed this way , deep @xmath8-band redshift samples measure the distribution function of the stellar mass production rate in galaxies , which we will refer to as the  function , in contrast to infrared samples , which for all but the youngest galaxies measure the distribution of the mass in galaxies .    in order to probe star formation rates ( sfr ) in individual galaxies to high redshifts ,",
    "large and extremely deep @xmath8-band redshift samples are required .",
    "here we use a large , 95% complete sample of galaxies to @xmath8 = 24.5 with redshifts to @xmath9 , to measure the evolution of the  function with redshift .",
    "we find that smooth single - entity evolution models can work if = 0.02 and many disks begin to form only at later epochs , but predict too many bright star formers at high @xmath4 in flat universes .",
    "cowie et al .  ( 1996 ) described lris observations of a @xmath8 = 24.5 galaxy sample in the hawaii fields ssa13 and ssa22 ( 26.2 arcmin@xmath10 ) .",
    "however , even the more intensively studied ssa22 field was only 84% complete at @xmath11 , with 13 @xmath12 galaxies unidentified .",
    "since extremely high completeness is required to determine the  function and the unidentified objects may correspond to higher redshift objects in the sample , we made intensive efforts to complete identifications of the remaining @xmath13 galaxies in ssa22 using deeper optical ( 350010000 ) observations and near infrared spectroscopy .",
    "the improved s / n and additional spectral features yield robust identifications for all but four sample objects",
    ".    the ssa22 @xmath0 sample is used with a nearly complete @xmath14 sample in ssa13 . in the @xmath15 sample covering 26 arcmin@xmath10",
    "there are 156 objects ( 124 galaxies ) of which all but 4 are identified ( 97% complete ) , while in the @xmath16 range covering 13 arcmin@xmath10 there are 47 objects ( 42 galaxies ) of which all but 2 are identified ( 95% complete ) .",
    "the six unidentified galaxies have extremely blue colors but no strong , with most likely redshifts @xmath17 , where the  line has moved from the observed optical while many stronger uv features have not yet entered the blue wavelength range .",
    "however , some objects may lie at somewhat higher redshifts .",
    "the redshift - magnitude relation and median redshifts are shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , along with the autofib sample of ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as at brighter magnitudes ,",
    "the median  redshifts , computed from the combination of the autofib data plus the present sample , are well described by a model ( solid line ) in which the luminosity function remains invariant ( broadhurst , ellis , & shanks 1988 ; colless et al .",
    "1990 ; cowie , songaila , & hu 1991 ; glazebrook et al .  1995a ; cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) , though this reflects a much more complex underlying situation .",
    "dashed and dotted lines show expected magnitudes for a flat  galaxy with @xmath18 for = 0.5 ( dashed ) and @xmath19 for = 0.02 ( dotted ) , which roughly map the upper envelope of the magnitude - redshift relation at @xmath20 . as we shall see below these correspond to star formation rates of roughly @xmath21",
    "yr@xmath22 ( = 0.5 ) and @xmath23 yr@xmath22 ( = 0.02 ) . as cowie",
    "et al .  ( 1996 ) emphasized , there are few galaxies with such high star formation rates at @xmath24 , and the envelope of the observed distribution lies well to the right of the curves at these redshifts , except for a few luminous agn present in the samples .",
    "the brighter @xmath25 galaxies lie to the left of the line , with mass formation rates up to a factor of 2.5 higher .",
    "( the autofib and hdf data are not used in the remainder of the paper in order to avoid completeness problems . )",
    "the present @xmath26 sample provides two independent measurements of the massive star formation rate .",
    "the first is the rest - frame far uv ( @xmath27 ) light , which for galaxies with significant ongoing star formation is a direct measure of the massive star formation rate , and hence of the metal production rate ( cowie 1988 ; songaila et al .",
    "translating this to a total star formation rate requires an uncertain assumption about the slope of the imf . for a salpeter imf extending over the range",
    "@xmath28 we may calibrate from the bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) models to obtain , in the absence of internal extinction , @xmath29 where a rest - frame wavelength of 2500  is chosen to minimize extrapolations from the @xmath8 band in lower redshift galaxies while also minimizing the slight contamination by older stars which is present at slightly longer wavelengths .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mdot ] ) may be derived from extremely simple physical arguments and is quite model independent except for the assumed imf ( cowie 1988 ) .",
    "2500  corresponds to @xmath8 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 , and may be interpolated at intermediate redshifts using approximate galaxy types inferred from the ( , , ) galaxy colors , so that the 2500  luminosity can be relatively accurately determined at least at the higher redshifts .",
    "the massive star formation rate can also be obtained from the line luminosities in the galaxies , which measure the production rate of ionizing photons .",
    "the most direct diagnostic is @xmath33 , which can be measured in these galaxies from @xmath34 . for most of the galaxies , however ,  is not measured , and we must draw on the secondary indicator  3727 , whose equivalent width is closely related to that of  by the relationship w@xmath35(+ ) = 2.3 w@xmath35 ( ) in a wide variety of local and moderate redshift galaxies ( kennicutt 1992 ; songaila et al .  1994 ) . for local blue irregular galaxies ( gallagher , bushouse , & hunter 1989 ) @xmath36 ) } }          \\over { \\ten{43}\\ { \\rm ergs\\ s}^{-1 } } \\right ) \\ ,",
    "\\label{eq : oii}\\ ] ] but we derive an essentially identical calibration for the present galaxies by comparison with the more direct uv luminosity calibration , suggesting that this calibration is reasonable for most rapidly star - forming galaxies irrespective of mass and redshift .",
    "the  luminosity provides an independent check on the uv luminosity which is particularly valuable at the low redshift end ( cowie , hu , & songaila 1995 ) .",
    "internal extinction in the galaxies is a serious concern for both diagnostics , since escaping uv photons can be reduced significantly by this effect , while the internal production of  and  can be reduced if ionizing photons are extinguished .",
    "however , at least for the higher redshift blue galaxies there appears to be remarkably little extinction and this effect appears weak .",
    "the great bulk of the @xmath37 galaxies are extremely flat in the rest - frame @xmath38 color , with a median value of 0.9 in the @xmath39 system , and have high rest - frame  equivalent widths ( with a median of 40 ) . since the intrinsic spectrum is expected to be flat or falling with increasing frequency , this places very severe constraints on the amount of dust . for a seaton ( 1979 ) law @xmath40 .",
    "even if  is intrinsically flat , @xmath41 on average , and at most half the light is lost to extinction .",
    "thus , the maximum uncertainty introduced by not including an extinction correction is probably a factor of 2 . to allow for the extinction we therefore assume that the luminosities in equations ( [ eq : mdot ] ) and ( [ eq : oii ] ) are reduced by a factor of 1.5 for a given mass formation rate .",

    "the distribution of @xmath49 in various redshift bins , computed using the @xmath50 method , is shown for open and flat geometries in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the star formation rate may be directly compared with the local star formation rate determined by gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from their  survey , which covered redshifts @xmath51 , for a 470 deg@xmath10 sample with ew(+)@xmath52 .",

    "the data points lie roughly a factor of two higher than the gallego et al .",
    "points , although both data sets are fully consistent in slope within the respective 2@xmath54 errors and uncertainties .",
    "interestingly , this same difference betwen the number density of local vs.  distant galaxies is seen in the @xmath55-band count analysis of huang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who suggested that there is a local deficiency of galaxies by a factor of 2 on scale sizes out to @xmath56 mpc .",
    "applying such a factor of 2 correction to the local sfr normalization would then directly match the data at @xmath53 .",
    "there is a significant evolution in the maximum mass formation rates with redshift for both open and flat geometries , in the sense that galaxies with much higher formation rates are seen at the higher redshifts ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) . for @xmath57",
    "there are 27 galaxies with @xmath58 yr@xmath22 while none are seen at @xmath59 . even allowing for the relative volumes the probability of their being drawn from the same distribution function",
    "is only @xmath60 for = 0.02 and @xmath61 for = 0.5 .",
    "however , the volume density of the rapid star formers is not high . for = 0.02",

    "in order to connect these results to the present epoch we need the mass distribution and universal mass density of the local galaxy sample , and these are best derived from the -band observations .",
    "there is still some disagreement in the derived values of the local -band luminosity function , and we adopt here the average of the samples of mobasher , sharples , & ellis ( 1993 ) , glazebrook et al .",
    "( 1995b ) , and cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which corresponds to a schechter function @xmath70  ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the disagreement in @xmath74 is @xmath75 mags .",
    "most of the light density of the universe is contained in objects near , with 50% of the light density in objects brighter than @xmath76 .",
    "most of these brighter galaxies are earlier than sb based on their , ,  colors ( huang et al .",
    "1997 ) , and for consistency we have converted from  magnitudes to masses using the bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) models , with  @xmath77 ergs s@xmath22 hz@xmath22 at 21000  corresponding to a stellar mass of @xmath78 , whence  corresponds to @xmath79 .",
    "the local stellar mass density of the universe is then @xmath80 mpc@xmath64 .",
    "the present - day spectra of the spiral galaxies are well represented by evolutionary models with exponentially decaying star formation rates .",
    "bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) fit an sb galaxy with a @xmath81 gyr and an age of 8 gyr , and an sc galaxy with a @xmath82 gyr and an age of 12 gyr . in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show the predicted luminosities for such exponentially evolving galaxies , with masses corresponding to  for @xmath83 gyr and @xmath84 gyr , and to 0.5  for @xmath82 gyr , for comparison with the observed luminosities .",
    "because both @xmath85 and the observed galaxy luminosities scale as @xmath86 , the curves can only be adjusted via the x - axis conversion from redshift to time and by the choice of the geometry , so the absolute agreement in the normalization of observed and predicted luminosities with redshift shows impressive consistency . for =",
    "0.02 we can fit the envelope with an @xmath42 mpc@xmath22 and a late formation epoch @xmath87 model , but for = 0.5 we need a low hubble constant ( @xmath88 mpc@xmath22 ) and an early formation epoch ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "basically , to match the fall of the maximum luminosity with redshift at @xmath2 , we require galaxy ages of very roughly 4 gyr at @xmath90 . the expected luminosity envelope is better matched for the @xmath91 case , while for = 0.5 there are fewer high luminosity galaxies at high redshift to form the more massive spiral galaxies .",
    "later type galaxies , such as the 0.5  sc shown by the dotted line in figure  [ fig:2 ] , are also consistent with the observations provided they are not too massive , so that their luminosities are not too high at the lower redshifts .",
    "a requirement of the models is therefore that the later type galaxies should have lower  luminosities than the earlier types , with scs being at least a magnitude fainter than sbs , and sds being considerably fainter still .",
    "the current -band data are not yet adequate to robustly investigate type dependence in the luminosity function , but this prediction should shortly be testable .",
    "we can now quantify the problem with the = 0.5 geometry : predicted luminosities of the early stages of near-  spirals are well above the detection limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) , at least for galaxies earlier than sb , and these galaxies must have formed early ( @xmath92 ) to provide large enough ages for their ultraviolet luminosities to match the observed redshift evolution and falloff at @xmath93 .",
    "thus , in this case we should see a number density of galaxies in the @xmath94 range which is comparable to the present - day number density ( @xmath95 mpc@xmath64 for @xmath96  and @xmath97 mpc@xmath64 for @xmath98 ) .",
    "even if all the unidentified objects are allocated to this redshift range there are only 10 objects , corresponding to a number density of @xmath99 mpc@xmath64 . for = 0.02",
    "the number densities are similar , but the problem can be avoided because the formation can begin in this redshift range , so that number conservation is not required . in this case",
    "only a fraction of the disks can have begun to form at @xmath100 with the remainder starting up at lower redshifts .    in any given redshift interval",
    "we can compute the total universal mass density formation rate , @xmath101 , in observed objects , which corresponds to a lower limit on @xmath101 .",
    "correcting for the incompleteness is not straightforward since it depends on the present - day type mix as a function of mass and the age at a given redshift .",
    "however , including only the observed objects and without correcting for faint end incompleteness , we find mass formation rates of  @xmath102 mpc@xmath64 yr@xmath22 for @xmath4 = ( 0.2 , 0.6 , 1.2 , 2.4 ) and = 0.02 , though these numbers are not directly comparable because of the varying cutoff in @xmath49 so that formation rates at high redshift are relatively underestimated . for objects with @xmath58 yr@xmath22 , where all objects would be detected at all of these redshifts , the average formation rates are ( 0.0 , 0.0 , @xmath103 mpc@xmath64 yr@xmath22 .",
    "the overall rates are sufficient to form the present - day mass , so that the open models do appear to provide a fully self - consistent description with the formation peaking at @xmath93 at least for the objects with higher star formation rates .",
    "we conclude that in a = 0.02 universe we can understand much of the recent history of galaxy formation in terms of the pure luminosity evolution of various spiral galaxy types , provided only that sc galaxies are at least a magnitude fainter in  than the average of galaxies earlier than sb , with sds yet fainter .",
    "models with = 0.5 predict too many bright objects at higher redshifts .",
    "the conclusion that this works well for = 0.02 geometries but not for flat geometries is intimately connected with pure luminosity evolution modelling of the number counts and redshift distributions ( e.g. , metcalfe et al .  1996 ) , where = 0.5 models tend to produce elbows in the counts and fail to reproduce the faint - end counts .",
    "the reason for this is that in the flat models the early stages of the spirals have near - constant and relatively bright magnitudes at all high redshifts ( cowie 1988 )  the same problem we encounter here with a radically different approach .",
    "the = 0.02 models do not suffer from this problem and have much more latitude in available time and volume to resolve the high number count problem ( lilly , cowie , & gardner 1991 ) , and also do achieve broad consistency ( metcalfe et al .",
    "1996 ) with optical and ir number counts and redshift distributions in this geometry .",
    "the authors are extremely grateful to stphane charlot for comments and help with the bruzual - charlot models , to richard ellis for providing the autofib data , and to josh barnes arif babul , harry ferguson , and mike fall for useful comments on an earlier draft .",
