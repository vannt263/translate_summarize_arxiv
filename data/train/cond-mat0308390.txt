    "heavy - fermion ( hf ) superconductivity has been a matter of interest with respect to an intimate interplay between magnetism and superconductivity since the discovery of hf superconductivity in cecu@xmath15si@xmath15 @xcite . from the extensive experimental and theoretical works on cecu@xmath15si@xmath15 , it has been revealed that the unconventional superconducting ( sc ) phase takes place at the border of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase and even coexists with it when the superconductivity occurs very close to the afm phase .",
    "cecu@xmath15si@xmath15 was the only cerium - based hf superconductor at ambient pressure , before a new family of hf compounds ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 forming in two - dimensional ( 2d ) tetragonal structures was discovered to show superconductivity below @xmath1 = 0.4 k and 2.3 k , respectively @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the value of @xmath16 k for the latter is a record of high @xmath1 to date among previous examples .",
    "meanwhile , the hf antiferromagnet cerhin@xmath0 , which crystallizes in the same crystal structure , was discovered to show superconductivity below @xmath1 = 2.2 k at pressures exceeding a critical pressure of 1.63 gpa @xcite . in cemin@xmath0 ( m = ir , co , and rh ) ,",
    "the unconventional superconductivity with line - node gap is suggested from the power - law temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence of specific heat @xcite , nuclear relaxation rate @xmath3 @xcite , penetration depth @xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite , and so on . systematic investigation of this new family of hf superconductors allows us to unravel a relationship between the occurrence of unconventional superconductivity and possible spin fluctuations in the normal state .",
    "in fact , a number of experiments point to non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior above @xmath1 in these compounds . for instance , in cecoin@xmath0 , the physical quantities such as the specific heat divided by temperature @xmath17 , the pauli susceptibility @xmath18 and @xmath19 reveal a significant increase upon cooling without entering any conventional fermi - liquid regime where these quantities stay constant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of resistivity does not follow a conventional @xmath20 dependence but indicate approximately a @xmath2-linear dependence @xcite . in the magnetic - field ( @xmath13 ) induced normal state , @xmath17 continues to increase upon cooling down to 50 mk .",
    "these nfl behaviors are considered to originate from magnetic fluctuations due to the proximity to an afm quantum critical point ( qcp ) . in cecoin@xmath0",
    ", therefore , the unconventional superconductivity arises from the nfl normal state .",
    "the afm spin fluctuations in ceirin@xmath0 and cerhin@xmath0 have been investigated by inelastic neutron diffraction @xcite and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) experiments @xcite . in both the compounds , anisotropic afm spin fluctuations develop in the normal state .",
    "the @xmath2 variation of @xmath3 in ceirin@xmath0 pointed to the presence of anisotropic afm spin fluctuations near the qcp @xcite .",
    "systematic study on the family of cemin@xmath0 is promising in unraveling possible role of spin fluctuations for the emergence of superconductivity .    in this paper",
    ", we report results of in - nqr at zero field ( @xmath13 = 0 ) and co - nmr under a magnetic field @xmath21 t on single crystals of cecoin@xmath0 , focusing on the characteristics of spin fluctuations in the normal state . in the normal state at @xmath22 , @xmath3 varies nearly as @xmath23 over a wide @xmath2 range .",
    "this unique behavior is consistent with the anisotropic afm spin - fluctuation s ( sfs ) model in case of the proximity to an afm qcp .",
    "the terminology of the anisotropic afm spin fluctuations means here that a magnetic correlation length @xmath24 within the tetragonal plane develops more dominantly than @xmath25 does along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "it is suggested that the value of @xmath16 k for cecoin@xmath0 becomes larger than @xmath1 = 0.4 k for ceirin@xmath0 because of approaching the afm qcp .",
    "the afm spin fluctuations in cecoin@xmath0 are suppressed by the magnetic field , reinforcing that cecoin@xmath0 is closely located to the qcp .",
    "high - quality single crystals of cecoin@xmath0 and lacoin@xmath0 were grown by in self - flux method as described elsewhere @xcite . for the nmr measurement in cecoin@xmath0",
    ", we used several pieces of single crystals stacked with a shape of flat plate which undergo a sc transition at @xmath27 2.3 k. cecoin@xmath0 has two inequivalent in sites per a unit cell .",
    "the @xmath4in - nqr @xmath28 measurement at @xmath22 was performed at the in(1 ) site located on the top and the bottom faces of the tetragonal unit cell at the nqr frequency @xmath29 8.16 mhz @xcite .",
    "the co - nmr @xmath28 was measured under @xmath13 = 1.1 t. the quadrupole frequency of @xmath30co for cecoin@xmath0 is estimated as @xmath31 0.23 mhz from the co - nmr spectra , so it is experimentally difficult to detect co - nqr signals at @xmath13 = 0 . note that a principal axis of the electric field gradient is parallel to the tetragonal @xmath26-axis at the in(1 ) and co sites . in order to deduce the @xmath32-derived contribution of magnetic fluctuations , the in - nqr and co",
    "- nmr @xmath28 measurements have been made on lacoin@xmath0 at @xmath22 and 0.9 t , respectively .",
    "these measurements were carried out by a conventional phase - coherent laboratory - built pulsed nqr / nmr spectrometer .",
    "figure 1 indicates the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath3 along with the data on lacoin@xmath0 at @xmath22 for the lowest quadrupole transition ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath3 is consistent with the result reported previously @xcite . in the sc state",
    ", @xmath3 decreases rapidly without any coherence peak just below @xmath16 k. in contrast to the suggestion by kohori _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite , we remark that a simple behavior of @xmath34 is not valid , presumably affected by the close proximity to the afm qcp .",
    "actually , a possibility has raised that the anomalous power - law @xmath2 behavior in london penetration depth at low @xmath2 well below @xmath1 is due to an extension of quantum criticality into the sc state @xcite . in this context",
    ", a deviation from @xmath35 allows us to address what happens in system located very close to afm qcp when it becomes superconducting . in order to clarify this ,",
    "further experiments under pressure are now in progress .",
    "dependence of @xmath3 of @xmath4 in in cecoin@xmath0 along with the data in lacoin@xmath0 at @xmath22 .",
    "the inset indicates the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath3 of @xmath30co at @xmath21 t in cecoin@xmath0 along with the data at @xmath36 t in lacoin@xmath0 . ]    here , we focus on the characteristics of spin fluctuations in the normal state .",
    "@xmath3 in lacoin@xmath0 is proportional to @xmath2 as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "in cecoin@xmath0 , however , @xmath3 is faster than that in lacoin@xmath0 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath37 varies nearly as @xmath23 in a wide @xmath2 range , where @xmath37 corresponds to the @xmath32 contribution of relaxation by subtracting a value of @xmath3 in lacoin@xmath0 at each temperature .",
    "this novel power - law behavior in @xmath37 points to the presence of strong afm spin fluctuations . above @xmath38",
    "150 k , @xmath3 is almost independent of temperature , exhibiting that the system is in a localized regime .",
    "it is known in hf systems that @xmath39 is scaled to the quasielastic linewidth in neutron - scattering spectrum , leading to a tentative estimation of the bandwidth of hf state .",
    "kohori _ et al .",
    "_ claimed that @xmath6-like dependence would arise from the spin fluctuations at the afm qcp for isotropic three dimensional ( 3d ) systems . the sfs theory for strongly correlated electron systems near an afm instability revealed that @xmath40 and @xmath41 for 3d and 2d systems , respectively by assuming an expansion of dynamical susceptibility as @xmath42 . here",
    ", the staggered susceptibility at the afm propagation vector @xmath43 , @xmath44 , follows the curie - weiss law above the nel temperature , namely , @xmath45 .",
    "note @xmath46 k at the afm qcp . at the afm qcp or @xmath47 k for 3d systems",
    ", @xmath3 is expected to be proportional to @xmath48 at high @xmath2 and varies as @xmath23 for @xmath49 smaller than about @xmath50 @xcite . here , @xmath49 is the reduced temperature defined by @xmath51 .",
    "it is hence unexpected for isotopic 3d systems to vary nearly as @xmath6 as observed in cecoin@xmath52 over such the wide @xmath2 range .",
    "we argue , therefore , this novel future in terms of the anisotropic afm - sfs model due to the layered structure .",
    "let us now consider a case where a magnetic correlation length ( @xmath25 ) along the @xmath26-axis for afm spin fluctuations remains in a much shorter range than @xmath24 within the basal plane .",
    "this is then modeled by assuming @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 . in this model ,",
    "@xmath55 is derived @xcite .",
    "recently , another calculation by assuming @xmath56 with being @xmath57 an anisotropy parameter has shown that physical properties are interpolated smoothly between 2 and 3 dimensions @xcite",
    ". this result may be consistent with the claim that the observed @xmath2 dependence of @xmath6 in a wide @xmath2 range is due to anisotropic afm sfs , since this @xmath2 variation is intermediate behavior between those for 2d and 3d systems .",
    "dependence of @xmath58 at @xmath22 in cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "here @xmath59 .",
    "the solid line indicates the relation @xmath60 with @xmath12 k in terms of the anisotropic afm spin - fluctuations ( sfs ) model ( see the text ) .",
    "the dotted and broken line correspond to the respective relations in terms of the isotropic 2d- and 3d - afm - sfs models . ]    the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath58 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the data are consistent with the anisotropic sfs model with @xmath9 k as indicated by the solid line in the figure .",
    "neither the 3d nor 2d sfs models are applicable as indicated by the dotted or broken lines .",
    "the value of @xmath61 k close to zero demonstrates that cecoin@xmath0 is closely located to the afm qcp .",
    "this anisotropic sfs model was already shown to interpret well the @xmath28 results of ceirin@xmath0 with @xmath62 = 8 k that is significantly larger than that for cecoin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "also the recent inelastic neutron experiment revealed that @xmath24 is larger than @xmath25 when approaching @xmath63 k in the hf antiferromagnet cerhin@xmath0 at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "these magnetic correlations in cemin@xmath0 are thus commonly characterized by the anisotropic afm spin fluctuations .",
    "we now discuss the relation between the value of @xmath1 and what extent is closer to the afm qcp in cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 .",
    "this closeness to the afm qcp is evaluated from the value of @xmath62 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the value of @xmath1 becomes larger as approaching the afm qcp , since @xmath1 increases as 0.4 k and 2.3 k as @xmath62 decreases as 8 k and 0.6 k for ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests an intimate interrelation between the afm spin fluctuations and the onset of @xmath64-wave superconductivity in these compounds .",
    "et al .  _ reported that the value of @xmath1 goes up as the lattice parameter @xmath65 increases @xcite .",
    "in this context , the increase in @xmath65 might enhance the 2d character of afm spin fluctuations leading to the enhancement in @xmath1 .    over a long decade",
    ", it is currently proposed that the value of @xmath1 could be enhanced as the dimensionality in electronic structure is reduced from 3d to 2d regime @xcite . consistently with this suggestion , the pressure - induced sc transition temperature in cein@xmath66 , that forms in the 3d cubic structure , is one order smaller than @xmath67 2.2 k in cerhin@xmath0 that forms in the layered structure .",
    "note that , in cein@xmath66 , a @xmath68 = const behavior is observed over a wide @xmath2 range above @xmath1 in a pressure range where the afm order is suppressed and the superconductivity appears @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , indicated that afm spin fluctuations are absent in this pressure range in the normal state of cein@xmath66 .",
    "by contrast , the afm spin fluctuations in cerhin@xmath0 continue to develop down to @xmath1 , exhibiting a character close to the afm qcp @xcite .",
    "the record high value of @xmath1 in cecoin@xmath0 at @xmath69 = 0 and in cerhin@xmath0 under pressure to date is likely due to the existence of strong afm spin fluctuations that develop in the vicinity of qcp .",
    "next , we move on to the magnetic field effect on the afm spin fluctuations at the close vicinity of qcp in cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "since an energy scale is anticipated to be very reduced around a qcp , it is expected that the criticality at the afm qcp is intimately influenced by applying small magnetic field . as a matter of fact , ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15 and ceru@xmath15si@xmath15 , which are anticipated to be located near a qcp ,",
    "show the strong field dependence of sfs @xcite .",
    "a recent theory also predicts that a strong magnetic field dependence should be observed at the qcp @xcite .",
    "vs @xmath2 plot at @xmath21 t along with the @xmath58 vs @xmath2 plot at @xmath22 t. the solid lines indicate the relations @xmath70 at @xmath71 1.1 t and @xmath72 at @xmath13 = 0 t based on the anisotropic spin - fluctuation s model ( see the text ) . ]    in order to address possible @xmath13-induced change in afm - sfs characteristics , we show the @xmath2 dependences of @xmath19 in cecoin@xmath0 and lacoin@xmath0 , in the inset of fig .  1 , that were measured at @xmath13 = 1.1 t parallel to the @xmath26-axis via the co - nmr experiments .",
    "figure 3 indicates the @xmath58 vs @xmath2 plot at @xmath13 = 1.1 t along with the @xmath58 vs @xmath2 plot at @xmath13 = 0 t. the respective data at @xmath71 0 t and 1.1 t are consistent with the anisotropic sfs model with @xmath73 0.6 and 2.5 k as indicated by the solid lines .",
    "interestingly , the application of magnetic field makes the value of @xmath62 increase from 0.6 k to 2.5 k , making it away from the proximity to the afm qcp .",
    "this result reinforces that the cecoin@xmath0 is closely located to the afm qcp .",
    "in conclusion , the measurements of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath3 by means of the @xmath4in - nqr and @xmath30co - nmr have revealed that the magnetic nature in cecoin@xmath0 is characterized by the strong afm spin fluctuations in the vicinity of qcp . at zero magnetic field ,",
    "the anomalous @xmath2 dependence of @xmath37 is well explained by the anisotropic spin - fluctuations model that predicts the relation @xmath74 with @xmath61 k. noting that this model was applied to ceirin@xmath0 with @xmath75 k , we have suggested that @xmath1 rises in cecoin@xmath0 because of approach to the afm qcp where @xmath76 k. the application of magnetic field makes the value of @xmath62 increase from 0.6 k to 2.5 k , making it away from the qcp .",
    "this result also suggests that cecoin@xmath0 is closely located to the qcp .",
