    "[ fig_ek_fbc_ga830 ]  ( b ) and ( a ) indicates that the artificial effect is only of minor importance for the reduction of quality factor . the quality factor is mainly determined by the imaginary edge vibration effect in graphene nanoresonators with imaginary edge vibrations .",

    "[ fig_ek_ga87 ]  ( c ) , which confirms that the imaginary edge vibration effect is the major reason for low quality factors .    we have previously shown that there is no imaginary edge vibration in the armchair graphene nanoresonator with fbc , so it can be used to study the pure artificial effect on the quality factor . fig .",

    ". we can learn from our simulations that the imaginary edge vibrations are of key importance for low quality factors .",
    "another experiment has shown that it is easily for free zigzag edges in the graphene nanoribbon to undergo a reconstruction and become more stable.@xcite the reconstruction is attributed to the edge vibrations at the free edge;@xcite thus it will partially eliminate the imaginary edge vibrations .",
    "considering the later experiment , a reasonable explanation for the experiment in ref .",
    "is that some samples happen to reconstruct their free edges , which help to remove some imaginary edge vibrations . as a result",
    ", the measured quality factor will be higher in these samples undergoing reconstruction , while quality factors are still low in samples without reconstruction .",
    "this explains the variation of quality factors between identically prepared graphene nanoresonators .",
    "our molecular dynamics simulations have disclosed two effects from the free edges on the graphene nanoresonator , which are both responsible for low quality factors .",
    "they are the imaginary edge vibration effect and the artificial effect .",
    "imaginary edge vibrations exist at free zigzag edges , so the imaginary edge vibration effect is of crucial importance for low quality factors in zigzag graphene nanoresonators ; while the artificial effect only slightly further reduces quality factors .",
    "the flipping process for imaginary edge vibrations between two doubly degenerate warping states will seriously break the coherence of the mechanical oscillation of the graphene nanoresonator .",
    "the power factor in the temperature dependence of quality factors is 1.0 for graphene nanoresonator with pbc , which reflects the intrinsic phonon - phonon scattering mechanism for the energy damping .",
    "this power factor decreases to be 0.28 in natural nanoresonators with fbc .",
    "this reduction is due to the flipping phenomenon for the imaginary edge vibrations .",
    "it is further reduced to be 0.16 in artificial nanoresonators with fbc .",
    "this further reduction results from the artificial effect .    there is no imaginary edge vibration in armchair graphene nanoresonator with fbc , so the artificial effect is the only mechanism for the decrease of quality factors .",
    "an extremely high quality factor can be obtained for armchair graphene nanoresonator with fbc , if its mechanical oscillation is naturally actuated .",
    "this result indicates that free edges not necessarily lead to low quality factors for graphene nanoresonators .",
