    "grb afterglow emission is usually modelled with a single power - law electron energy spectrum : @xmath4 with the power - law index @xmath5 and @xmath1 being the lorentz factor of the electron ( see piran 1999 for a review ) .",
    "relativistic shock acceleration theory predicts an universal @xmath6 which fits many afterglow spectra ( waxman 1997 ; galama et al 1998 ; wijers and galama 1999 ) .    in some grb afterglows ,",
    "harder electron energy spectrum @xmath7 appears to be needed ( panaitescu and kumar 2001a ; sagar et al 2001 ; cowsik et al 2001 ; bhattacharya 2001 ) .",
    "such a spectrum must have an upper cutoff , an _ injection break @xmath8 _ , beyond which @xmath9 must exceed @xmath10 in order to keep the total energy in the electron distribution finite .",
    "the evolution of the afterglow emission is influenced by the evolution of @xmath8 ( bhattacharya 2001 ; panaitescu and kumar 2001b ; dai and cheng 2001 )    the minimum lorentz factor @xmath3 of the distribution is determined by the fraction @xmath11 of the postshock thermal energy that is injected into electrons . for @xmath5",
    "this is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bulk lorentz factor of the blast wave shock and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are proton and electron masses respectively ( sari , piran and narayan 1998 ) .",
    "relativistic shock acceleration theory predicts that the _ universal spectrum _ with @xmath6 can extend only down to a minimum @xmath16 . below this energy",
    "the electron larmor radius becomes smaller than the shock thickness , the shock is no longer perceived as a discontinuity and the acceleration efficiency drops ( hoshino et al 1992 ; gallant et al 2000 ; kirk 2002 ) .",
    "however for a low @xmath11 the @xmath3 estimated from eq .",
    "2 , and routinely used in grb afterglow modelling , works out to be much lower than @xmath17 .",
    "this creates a contradiction .    in the region between @xmath3 and @xmath17 ,",
    "some special pre - acceleration mechanisms are needed ( kirk 2002 ; gallant et al 2000 ) .",
    "one candidate for this is a variant of the ion magnetosonic wave absorption mechanism proposed for electron - positron - proton plasma ( hoshino et al 1992 ) .",
    "this mechanism produces a hard energy spectrum , but has a natural upper cutoff at exactly the @xmath17 defined above .",
    "we conjecture that for electrons in grb afterglows , a @xmath18 universal spectrum is valid down to @xmath17 , and the energy spectrum below this , down to an appropriate @xmath3 , is harder , with a @xmath19 .",
    "we identify the injection break @xmath8 with @xmath17 .",
    "this would also introduce a corresponding injection break @xmath20 in the radiation spectrum . here",

    "we have calculated the evolution of the afterglow radiation spectrum based on this premise .",
    "writing the flux at a frequency @xmath22 at time @xmath23 as @xmath24 , we find the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 in different spectral regimes to be as follows :     @xmath27 + @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 + @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath30 & @xmath34 + @xmath35 & @xmath36&@xmath37 & @xmath38 + @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41&@xmath38 + @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44&@xmath45 +    in the table , the third column gives the light curve slopes after the lateral spreading of the collimated outflow dominates the dynamics , and the second column those before this phase .",
    "the transition between them is often called the _ jet break_. the quantity @xmath46 stands for the synchrotron cooling break frequency in the radiation spectrum .",
    "the afterglow of grb010222 has been modelled previously as a burst in a very high density medium undergoing a transition to a non - relativistic expansion ( masetti et al 2001 ) , which can not explain the early appearance of radio emission ; or as a hard electron spectrum afterglow that underwent an early jet break ( sagar et al 2001 ; cowsik et al 2001 ; panaitescu and kumar 2001a ) , which had difficulty explaining the spectral slope observed in x - ray bands .",
    "we suggest that this afterglow had an injection break @xmath20 in the x - ray band @xmath47  day after the burst , had a jet break transition at @xmath48  day , and evolved in a normal ism . with an assumed @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and a smooth joining of the power - law segments , we are able to obtain good fits to the spectrum and the light curve of this afterglow , as shown in the figures .",
    "we have computed the evolution of a grb afterglow with a hard electron energy spectrum up to an injection break at @xmath51 times the bulk lorentz factor of the shock . above the injection break",
    ", relativistic shock acceleration predicts an universal , relatively softer , electron energy spectrum .",
    "we obtain good fits to the observed evolution of grb010222 afterglow using this model .",
    "we suggest that hard spectrum emission is more likely to be seen in grb afterglows that have a relatively low @xmath11 ."
