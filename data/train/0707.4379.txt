    "it is well - known that @xmath0 and harmonic oscillator potentials are exceptional because , in addition to rotation invariance , they have accidental dynamical symmetries . at the classical level",

    "we also relate the hamilton operator to the corresponding casimir operator and we discuss the unusual multiplets realized in the discrete spectrum .",

    "similarly , the quantization condition for the radial motion is given by @xmath122 the factor @xmath123 , which is sometimes not taken into account in bohr - sommerfeld quantization , arises for librations but is absent for rotations . using eqs.([orbitr ] ) , ( [ eccentricity ] ) , and ( [ orbitp ] ) and integrating over the period @xmath124 it is straightforward to obtain @xmath125 which leads to @xmath126 it will turn out that this result is exact and not just limited to the semi - classical regime .",

    "the corresponding quantized energy values are given by eq.([energyc ] ) .",
    "now @xmath131 is the number of nodes of the radial wave function and @xmath78 is the angular momentum quantum number .",

    "it is interesting to note that there are additional accidental degeneracies in the spectrum when the scale factor @xmath105 is a rational number .",

    "it is worth mentioning that there are other mathematical solutions of the schrdinger equations which , however , do not qualify as physical wave functions because they diverge at the origin .",
    "these solutions will play a certain role later , when we discuss the accidental symmetry multiplets .",
    "for example , let us consider the case @xmath135 corresponding to the deficit angle @xmath136 . in that case , a wave function without nodes ( i.e.  with @xmath137 ) and with angular momentum @xmath138 is degenerate in energy with a wave function with two nodes ( @xmath139 ) and with @xmath140 .",

    "some features of the energy spectrum are illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the fact that , for rational @xmath105 , all classical orbits are closed and the discrete spectrum of the hamiltonian has accidental degeneracies suggests that there is a hidden conserved quantity generating a corresponding accidental symmetry . from the plane ( with @xmath149 ) we are familiar with the runge - lenz vector and an accidental @xmath2 symmetry .",

    "let us address the questions of hermiticity and of the domains of the various operators . as we have discussed in the introduction , once it is endowed with an appropriate extension ,",
    "the hermitean kinetic energy operator @xmath75 becomes self - adjoint and thus qualifies as a physical observable .",
    "the same is true for the full hamiltonian including the potential . in this case",
    ", we assume the standard friedrichs extension @xcite , which implies that there is no @xmath16-function potential located at the tip of the cone .    using @xmath176 as well as @xmath177 ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that , at least formally , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , which implies @xmath180 .",
    "however , as we have seen in the introduction , hermiticity also requires appropriate boundary conditions , which restrict the domains of the corresponding operators .",
    "it is interesting to note that , using @xmath181 , the operators @xmath152 and @xmath153 of eq.([eqrpm ] ) formally agree with the components of the standard runge - lenz vector for the plane from eq.([rungelenz ] ) .",
    "the runge - lenz vector for the plane is a hermitean and even self - adjoint operator acting in a domain @xmath108 $ ] that contains the domain of the hamiltonian .",

    "proper symmetry generators should map wave functions from the domain of the hamiltonian back into @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "hence , for @xmath185 , the operators @xmath166 and @xmath167 do not represent proper symmetry generators .",

    "however , as we will see below , another subtlety arises because @xmath189 may turn a physical wave function that is regular at the origin ( and thus obeys the boundary condition of eq.([boundary ] ) ) into a singular one .",
    "this further limits the domain of the operators @xmath189 .",
    "the unusual ( not properly quantized ) value of the casimir spin can be traced back to the mathematical fact that the runge - lenz vector  although hermitean in its appropriate domain  does not act as a hermitean operator in the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "hence , in retrospect the @xmath2 commutation relations of eq.([su2 ] ) are rather formal .",

    "this is another indication that the accidental `` @xmath2 '' symmetry of eq.([su2 ] ) is rather unusual .",
    "how can we further understand the puzzling result that the casimir spin @xmath175 is not always quantized in integer or half - integer units ?",
    "it seems that we found new unusual representations for something as well understood as an @xmath2 algebra .",
    "acting with @xmath189 on a @xmath1-periodic wave function @xmath194 one changes both @xmath195 and @xmath78 . for @xmath196",

    "the particle on a cone provides us with an interesting physical system in which symmetries manifest themselves in a very unusual manner .",
    "although the hamiltonian commutes with the generators of an @xmath2 symmetry , the multiplets of degenerate states do not always correspond to integer or half - integer casimir spin .",

    "only the states with square - integrable single - valued @xmath1-periodic wave functions belong to the physical spectrum , and all other members of the corresponding `` @xmath2 '' representation must be discarded .",

    "in contrast to many other quantum mechanics problems , in order to understand motion on a cone it was necessary to address mathematical issues such as the domains of operators as well as hermiticity versus self - adjointness . still , we have not elaborated on some questions related to different possible self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian . for the particle on the cone ,",
    "such issues seem worth investigating . in this work ,",
    "we have limited ourselves to the standard friedrichs extension of the hamiltonian .",
    "alternative self - adjoint extensions correspond to an additional @xmath16-function potential located at the tip of the cone .",
    "this will modify the problem in an interesting way .",
    "in particular , we expect that , in the presence of an additional @xmath16-function potential , the accidental degeneracy will be partly lifted .",
    "however , since the @xmath16-function only affects states with @xmath140 , some accidental degeneracy will remain .",
    "the particle on the cone provides us with another example for the deep connection between the closedness of all bound classical orbits and accidental degeneracies in the discrete spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "even if the classical system has various quantum analogues ( because there are different possible self - adjoint extensions ) some accidental degeneracy still persists .",
    "it is also remarkable that , like in other cases with accidental symmetries , for the particle on the cone semi - classical bohr - sommerfeld quantization provides the exact quantum energy spectrum .",
    "we are unaware of another system for which a similarly unusual symmetry behavior has been observed .",
    "it is interesting to ask if symmetry can manifest itself in this unusual manner also in other quantum systems .",
    "for example , cones of graphene may provide a motivation to study accidental degeneracies of the dirac equation on a cone . also higher - dimensional spaces with conical singularities",
    "may be worth investigating .",
