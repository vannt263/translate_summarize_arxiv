    "formally , the eigenvalue problem ( [ se],[bcxy ] ) possesses an exact solution in terms of kummer functions @xcite , but this solution is hardly useful , as these functions are rather complicated .",

    "it has two main objectives .",
    "the first one is to examine the semiclassical approach for estimating the eigenvalues @xmath2 .",
    "the idea of employing the wkb approximation for the study of confined systems has a long history . probably , the discussion most relevant for the present study is a four decade old work by vawter @xcite , but see also references @xcite . here",
    "the wkb method is augmented and adapted to the special problem at hand .",
    "the main subtleties resulting from the fact that there are three regions in @xmath35 space ( where the wkb connection formulae assume different forms ) are clarified , and the crossover between these regions is treated with special care .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are found from an expression @xmath36 $ ] relating the wkb action @xmath37 at energy @xmath38 with a function @xmath39 which encodes all the physics behind the connection formulae .",
    "the main achievement of this part is an elucidation of @xmath40 for the entire range @xmath41 and a subsequent evaluation of the eigenvalues @xmath2 which appear to be in excellent agreement with the exact ones . as a byproduct , the source of disagreement ( as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) between the wkb solutions and the exact energies occurring when the right turning point is close to the edge , is remedied .",
    "our second goal is to examine whether a scaling relation of the form @xmath42 , exists within a wide domain of energies @xmath43 and oscillator center parameter @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath44 is a linear function of the energy quantum number @xmath45 which serves as a length scale in energy space , while @xmath46 is a scaling exponent .",
    "our main result in this context is that there is indeed an approximate scaling law ( albeit with small correction ) , which takes the form @xmath47 . \\label{scalingfg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath14 is a solution of a simple implicit equation , ( the scaling variable @xmath48 should not be confused with the @xmath24 coordinate of the particle ) .",
    "the scaling relation ( [ scalingfg ] ) of edge state energies is supported by numerical results based on exact diagonalization .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in section [ secii ] the principles of the wkb method as employed here are recalled in terms of the wkb action and the function @xmath40 .",
    "it becomes evident that the magnitude and sign of @xmath8 as well as those of the right turning point crucially determine the way of constructing the connection formula .",
    "the relevant algorithm is worked out and and the wkb approximated energies @xmath49 are obtained and compared with the exact ones in section [ seciii ] . finally , in section [ seciv ] the scaling hypothesis is tested and a scaling relation for @xmath49 is suggested .",
    "this section briefly introduces and discusses the basic ingredients of semiclassical action and the function @xmath40 which are necessary for the subsequent implementation of the wkb analysis . for notational convenience the harmonic term @xmath50 with the hard - wall condition at @xmath1",

    "a glance at figure [ regimesfig ] indicates that the turning points are , @xmath54     and a confining wall ( edge ) at @xmath1 .",
    "several regions in @xmath55 parameter space have to be considered . for @xmath56 , the low energy region ( @xmath57 )",

    "in most cases , the structure of this relation involves the action @xmath37 as an argument of a trigonometric function , and its decoding can then be casted in the general form , @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{scquant}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that equation ( [ scquant ] ) is not an identity , but , rather , an implicit equation for finding the eigenvalues @xmath2 .",
    "the function @xmath66 should be calculated independently and encodes the details of the connection formulae .",
    "arriving at this equation ( equivalently knowing @xmath67 explicitly ) is the central part of the wkb method ( the computation of the action @xmath37 is straightforward in most cases ) .",
    "once this task is achieved , the solutions @xmath2 of this implicit equation are the required eigenvalues within the wkb approximation . inserting the solutions into equation ( [ scquant ] )",
    "implies the _ identity _ @xmath68 ,   \\label{scident }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which defines @xmath69 self consistently as function of the discrete energy quantum number @xmath3 and the continuous variable @xmath8",
    ".    the easier part of the wkb procedure is calculation of the action itself , which in the present problem of confined harmonic oscillator becomes elementary .",
    "it depends on the appropriate region in @xmath55 parameter space , as depicted on figure [ regimesfig ] . in the low energy region , @xmath57 the positions of the turning points are @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the action @xmath5 is given by @xmath72    in both high energy region @xmath73 , the turning points are located at @xmath70 and @xmath74 .",

    "it is equal to @xmath87 . ]",
    "the less trivial task which will occupy us in the next subsection is to calculate the function @xmath40 .",
    "when the potential is smooth and the wall is far from the right turning point @xmath88 , @xmath89 is determined by the standard wkb procedure such that the solutions for @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( the classically forbidden regions ) contain only decaying exponents .",
    "each turning point @xmath92 then contributes a term @xmath93 where @xmath94 is an _ integer _ ( also referred to as the maslov index for the pertinent turning point ) , and",
    "this is the situation appropriate in the lower part of region @xmath57 in figure [ regimesfig ] where @xmath96 , implying @xmath97 .",
    "the definition can be extended to the situation when a turning point occurs at the wall .",
    "although there is no solution to match on the right of the turning point , the condition @xmath98 replaces the connection formula and implies @xmath99 .",
    "this is the situation relevant for the higher part of region @xmath59 and for region @xmath62 in figure [ regimesfig ] , implying @xmath100 .",
    "as will be stressed below , the situation is different in the crossover region ( around the horizontal dashed line in figure [ regimesfig ] ) .",
    "since @xmath40 is expected to vary smoothly between @xmath9 and @xmath11 , it can not be written in terms of an integer @xmath101 .",
    "if one insists on the same parametrization @xmath95 , this implies that @xmath101 is a non - integer maslov index @xcite .",
    "an attempt to use @xmath97 for @xmath102 and @xmath100 for @xmath103 is too nave and leads to an artificial discontinuity at @xmath104 since    @xmath105    [ disc ]    this artificial discontinuity is displayed in figure [ enappfig ] below .",

    "a proper analysis of the crossover regions within the wkb formalism should then remedy the discontinuity problem by a proper treatment of the medium energy region @xmath111 .",
    "this is carried below by approaching the cross over region from below ( @xmath112 ) and from above ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the case @xmath114 where the oscillator center is very close to the wall requires some special treatment at low energy where the linear approximation for the potential near the turning point is not valid .",
    "after this task is completed , the eigenvalues calculated by the wkb approach are compared with the exact ones , and the agreement is virtually perfect .      when @xmath102 ( region @xmath57 in figure ( [ regimesfig ] ) ) , the turning points and the wkb action are    @xmath116    for @xmath117 the eigenvalues are expected to approach the energies @xmath118 of the unrestricted harmonic oscillator .",
    "the question is how they are modified when @xmath38 approaches @xmath119 from below . for energies close to @xmath120",
    "the turning point @xmath88 is rather close to the wall at @xmath1 , and this must be taken into account .",
    "practically , it means that the wave function in the classically forbidden region @xmath121 must include also an exponentially increasing contribution ( beside the exponentially decreasing one ) , since vanishing of the wave function at the wall @xmath1 can be achieved only by a proper combination of the two waves .",
    "therefore , a modification of the standard wkb connection procedure is required near @xmath88 in order to take into account the effect of the wall behind the turning point . on the other hand ,",
    "the connecting procedure at the left turning point is standard .",
    "recall that to the left of the point @xmath122 there is a single wave , that decays as @xmath123 .",
    "this means that within the linear approximation for the potential near the turning points , only the first airy function @xmath124 is used near @xmath122 .",
    "the connecting procedure around @xmath122 implies that the wkb approximation for the wave function for @xmath125 is @xmath126 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac { c } { \\sqrt{k(x ) } } \\sin[s-{{\\cal s}}(x , x_{2})+\\frac { \\pi}{4 } ] , \\label{psiwkb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is a constant .",
    "the modification near the second turning point @xmath88 which is close to the wall assumes that in the small region @xmath121 the potential is approximated by a linear expansion near @xmath88  : @xmath128 in terms of the variable @xmath129 and within the approximation ( [ vlinear ] ) , the schrdinger equation at the vicinity of @xmath88 reads @xmath130 unlike the analysis near @xmath122 , here the combination of _ both _ airy functions is required in order to construct the solution around @xmath88 , that is , @xmath131 when this combination is examined at @xmath132 ( that is , @xmath133 ) and the asymptotic form of the airy functions is used , it is found that the wave function at @xmath134 is , @xmath135+\\beta \\cos [ { { \\cal s}}(x , x_{2})+\\frac{\\pi}{4 } ] .",

    "<S> analysis of edge - state energies in the integer quantum hall effect is carried out within the semiclassical approximation . when the system is wide so that each edge can be considered separately , this problem is equivalent to that of a one dimensional harmonic oscillator centered at @xmath0 and an infinite wall at @xmath1 , and appears in numerous physical contexts . </S>",
