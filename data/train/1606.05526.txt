    "even though general relativity is a very well - tested theory , there is a strong motivation to modify general relativity at large scale . this is because to explain the accelerating cosmic expansion in general relativity , a cosmological constant has to be included @xcite .",
    "even though the existence of such a cosmological constant is predicted from quantum field theories , quantum field theories predict a cosmological constant which is @xmath0 times larger than the observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "this has motivated the study of modified theories of gravity , and the scalar - tensor theories are such a modification of general relativity which could explain accelerating cosmic expansion @xcite .",
    "however , these theories in general contain higher derivative terms in the action , and such higher derivative terms gives rise to ostrogradsky ghost degree of freedom .",
    "these in turn cause instabilities in the theory called the ostrogradsky instabilities .",
    "it is possible to avoid ostrogradsky ghosts by using a theory with galileon symmetry @xcite .",
    "even though this galileon theory also contains higher derivative terms in the action , the galilean symmetry ensures that the field equations are only second - order differential equations .",
    "thus , the galilean symmetry ensures that the ostrogradski ghost instabilities are avoided in these theories . in the decoupling limit",
    ", this theory contains a higher - order derivative interaction known as the cubic galileon .",
    "it is possible to construct a theory with quartic and quintic galileon @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to add couplings of the scalar to curvature tensors , away from the decoupling limit . this way the horndeski theory",
    "is obtained , and field equations for both the scalar field and the metric are again second order differential equations @xcite .",
    "so , horndeski theory is also free from ostrogradsky ghosts , and it does not contain the ostrogradsky instabilities associated with these ghosts .    this horndeski formalism is a general formalism and it can be used to analyse a non - minimal coupling of other fields to the metric .",
    "thus , it is possible to analyse a horndeski coupling of the metric to a vector field @xcite . in this formalism , the vector field is again coupled to the metric using a non - minimal coupling .",
    "furthermore , the field equations for this vector field are again second - order field equations .",
    "thus , the ostrogradsky ghost terms are avoided even for the horndeski coupling of a vector field to the metric . as we will be interested in applying such a vector - tensor - horndeski theory to astrophysics",
    ", we will assume such a vector field is a fundamental field in nature , which is obtained by increasing the field content of general relativity , and it is not the usual electromagnetic field .",
    "this is important as astrophysical objects are neutral and do not have an electric charge .",
    "so , the electromagnetic field can not have a direct effect on the physics of such astrophysical objects .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the gravity couples to the electromagnetic field in the usual way , and there is no reason for it to couple to the physical electromagnetic field in a non - minimal way in any astrophysical object . however ,",
    "if we assume that there exists an astrophysical vector field , which has negligible effect on small scale , then it is possible that such an astrophysical vector field can couple to the metric in a non - minimal way .",
    "this coupling of such an astrophysical vector field can have non - trivial effects on the astrophysical phenomena .",
    "so , in this paper , we will analyse the effect of such a non - minimal coupling of an astrophysical vector field on the physics of a compact star .",
    "it may be noted that such fundamental vector fields have been proposed as a solution to various different physical problems , and have also been used to explain many interesting astrophysical phenomena . just like the scalar fields",
    ", the vector field have also been used to explain cosmic expansion @xcite , and even the naturalness problem @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that there the vector - tensor theories produce many non - trivial phenomenological effects which can not be produced in the scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that anomalies exist in the alignment of the low multipoles of the cmb @xcite and the hemispherical asymmetry @xcite .",
    "such anomalies suggest that there might be a preferential direction in the universe , and this can be explained using such a vector field .",
    "furthermore , such fundamental vector fields have also been used to study inflation @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of higher derivative terms can produce ostrogradski ghost instability in such vector - tensor theories .",
    "however , such ostrogradski ghost instability can be avoided by using the horndeski formalism .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study a vector - tensor - horndeski theory .",
    "it may be noted that there are other interesting motivation to introduce such vector fields .",
    "this is because there exists a discrepancy between the predicted and observed dynamics of galaxies  @xcite , and it has been proposed that the discrepancy can be resolved by increasing the field content of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the field content of this modified theory of gravity contains such a vector field .",
    "it may be noted that this theory agrees with the predictions made by the modified newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "as the field content of general relativity contains a vector field , it has been observed that astrophysical black holes in this modification of gravity can mathematically resemble a reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution  @xcite .",
    "however , the charge of this vector field is generated from mass and not an electromagnetic source @xcite . as the astrophysical objects are not charged , and so any coupling of metric to a electromagnetic field can not be applied to study such astrophysical objects .",
    "however , as this additional vector field is produced from mass and not electric charge @xcite , it is possible that such a field can have direct effect on astrophysical phenomena .",
    "furthermore , in this theory , there is a certain amount of freedom to choose the action for vector field , and it has been demonstrated that coupling the metric to a non - linear vector field can turn a black hole into a gray hole @xcite . as it has been demonstrated that different form of the vector field action can produce different physical results , it is interesting to investigate other forms of coupling of vector field to metric . furthermore , as this vector field occur in the field content of general relativity , it will also be interesting to investigate the astrophysical application of such a theory .",
    "so , in this paper , we will use the horndeski formalism to couple a vector field to the metric , and we use this vector - tensor - horndeski theory to analyse a compact star .",
    "in this section , we will analyse the main features of a vector - tensor - horndeski theory .",
    "it has been proposed that by increasing the field content of general relativity certain astrophysical phenomena can be explained @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for compact stars this would deform astrophysical solutions , and these deformed solutions would resemble a charged black hole solution @xcite .",
    "it is physically important to point out that the vector field introduced here is not the usual electromagnetic field , but an astrophysical vector field and it has negligible effect at small scale .",
    "however , it is expected to change the astrophysical dynamics at larger scale . in this section",
    ", we will use the horndeski formalism to non - minimally couple such a vector field to the metric .",
    "thus , we first introduce as astrophysical vector field @xmath1 with the field tensor @xmath2 .",
    "we denote the source for such a vector field as @xmath3 .",
    "now the energy - momentum tensor for this astrophysical vector field can be written as @xmath4 , and we will also denote the energy - momentum tensor for other fields in the theory by @xmath5 . there is a conserved charge associated with this vector field , as we can write a divergence free current @xmath6 . now using horndeski formalism @xcite , we couple this astrophysical vector field to the metric as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is given by @xmath9",
    "it may be noted that if @xmath10 , this theory reduced to the usual vector - tensor theory .",

    "the dual tensors can be defined as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13}_{[\\gamma\\delta]}/ 4!$ ] is total asymmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "thus , we can write the lagrangian for this vector - tensor - horndeski theory as @xmath14 this lagrangian has a non - trivial coupling between the astrophysical vector field and the metric , which was not present in other vector - tensor theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the static spherically symmetric solutions for a vector field has been studied using the horndeski formalism @xcite .",
    "we will apply this solution to analyse a compact star in this theory , because even though physically , this vector field is an astrophysical vector field , mathematically , this solution will resemble the static spherically symmetric solutions for a horndeski vector field @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the electromagnetic fields which can not have a direct effect on compact stars , this vector field can change the behavior of compact stars .",
    "now for this horndeski astrophysical vector field @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 , and for isotropic matter fields , we can take a perfect fluid with @xmath17 .",
    "the static spherically symmetric metric for a compact star can be written in the schwarzschild - droste coordinates @xmath18 .",

    "the boundary conditions used for analyzing this system in this vector - tensor - horndeski theory are similar to those used in the einstein gravity , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "so , the radius of the compact star can be taken to be @xmath55 , such that the pressure vanishes .",
    "now we can analyse compact stars using this formalism . in astrophysics ,",
    "the term compact star is used to collectively refer to white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes .",
