    "the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the major puzzles of astrophysics .",
    "large - scale cosmological simulations utilizing the currently favoured lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) paradigm of cosmology predicts the large - scale distribution of galaxies in space as observed today , but we have not yet met with equal success on small scales due to incomplete knowledge of how the baryons are distributed ( vogelsberger et al .",
    "2014 ) . as these baryons mostly reside in stellar discs in galaxies , understanding the formation and evolution of galactic discs is the heart of the galaxy formation theory ( feltzing 2015 and references therein ) .    in this regard , the milky way galaxy provides an excellent testing ground for models of galaxy formation and evolution thanks to the ability to resolve individual stars of its stellar populations and analyse them in exquisite detail .",
    "as the disc formed dissipatively and evolved dynamically , much of the dynamical information is lost .",
    "however , the chemical content of the disc stars may have preserved the dissipative history , the key to unraveling the formation history of the milky way ( de silva et al .",
    "2009 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "since the surface density of gas and star formation rate ( sfr ) in the galactic disc have varied , as seen in many galaxies , the measured chemical abundances are a function of position as well . therefore , measurement of the chemical abundance distribution in the disc ( i.e. the radial abundance gradient ) and the gradient s temporal variation over the disc s lifetime present strong observational constraints on the theoretical models of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ; magrini et al .",

    "abundance gradients in the milky way can be measured using a wide variety of tracers including the young population of hii regions , ob stars , and cepheid variables , and planetary nebulae of different ages , cool unevolved stars and red giants in the field ( see for example , magrini et al .",

    "the cooler main sequence stars or red giants which are members of ocs provide not only abundance estimates for elements sampling all the major processes of stellar nucleosynthesis  but a collection of stars whose age , distance , kinematics and metallicity can be measured with greater certainty than for field stars .",
    "moreover , it is possible from an oc s space motion and a model of the galactic gravitational potential to study the dynamics and estimate a cluster s birthplace ( wu et al . 2009 ; vande putte et al . 2010 ) .    in recent years",
    ", modern high - resolution spectrographs and large reflectors have provided high - quality spectra of stars in ocs for secure measures of abundances , and extended abundance estimates to distant ocs in the direction of galactic anti - centre ( carraro et al .",

    "2005 , 2012 ; sestito et al . 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "however , not all the investigators have arrived at similar measures of the radial metallicity gradient which may be partly related to the different methods adopted ( see for example , magrini et al . 2009 ; heiter et al .",
    "our current understanding suggests a gradient of about @xmath00.06 dex kpc@xmath4 ( friel et al .",
    "2002 ; pancino et al .",
    "2010 ) to @xmath00.20 dex kpc@xmath4 ( frinchaboy et al .",

    "it is especially puzzling that the flattening of the metallicity distribution of ocs at large radii is not shown by the galactic field stars ( cheng et al .",
    "2012 ; hayden et al .",
    "2014 ) including cepheids ( luck & lambert 2011 ; genovali et al . 2014 ) where field stars suggest a constant steep decline of metallicity out to r@xmath10 of 18 kpc .",
    "another fascinating result , in common for both the field stars and ocs at large radii , is the evidence for enhanced [ @xmath11/fe ] ratios in the outer galactic disc ( yong et al .",
    "2005 ; bensby et al .",
    "2011 ; luck & lambert 2011 ) .",
    "the fact that the @xmath11-enriched clusters older than 4@xmath05 gyr , reminiscent of rapid star formation history , have populated the galactic disc beyond 12 kpc , where the star formation is slow due to low surface density of gas , is a puzzle in conflict with the inside - out formation scenarios of the milky way ( bovy et al .",
    "2012 ; rokar et al .",
    "a significant flattening of the metallicity gradient observed in the outskirts of other spiral galaxies ( scarano & lpine 2013 ) calls for a thorough understanding of many processes regulating the evolution of milky way .",
    "this paper extends our homogeneous abundance analysis of ocs to a new sample of ocs to aid in exploring further the evolution of the galactic disc .",

    "2012 , 2013 , 2015 ) abundance measurements for 16 ocs with ages from 130 myr to 4.3 gyr and r@xmath10s from 8.3 and 11.3 kpc .",
    "we combine our sample of twenty - eight ocs ( 12 from this study and 16 from our previous papers ) with a sample of 51 ocs drawn from the literature for which we have remeasured the chemical content using their published ews , our models , linelists and reference solar abundances to establish a common abundance scale .",

    "( 2015 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe observations , data reduction and radial velocity measurements .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the abundance analysis and section 4 to discussing the age@xmath0abundance relations .",
    "we present in section 5 the radial abundance distribution of ocs and field stars and discuss the results in comparison with theoretical chemodynamical models of gce . in section 6 we compute the birthplace of ocs with other relevant orbital parameters and focus on discussing the origin of older ocs in the outer galactic disc .",
    "finally , section 7 provides the conclusions .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "we merged our sample of twenty - eight ocs ( 12 from this study and 16 from our previous papers ) with the available high - quality results in the literature to enlarge the dataset .",
    "systematic offsets between chemical abundances of ocs collected from different resources and our sample of 28 ocs are negligible as we have remeasured the chemical content of all 51 ocs drawn from the literature using their published ews , our models , linelists and reference solar abundances .",
    "the chemical abundances of 51 ocs are presented previously in table 13 from reddy et al .",
    "stars in our sample and those drawn from the literature are similar red giants analysed identically and , thus , systematic errors affecting the abundances and abundance ratios [ x / fe ] should be consistent ( and small ) across the sample which spans a narrow range in metallicity of @xmath13 @xmath00.5 to 0.3 dex but a good range in ages and galactocentric distances . following the kinematic criteria described in reddy et al . (",
    "2015 ) , we assigned ocs either to the thin disc , thick disc or halo populations using the space velocity components of the cluster calculated using the proper motions , rvs , and heliocentric distances drawn mostly from the catalogue of dias et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and occasionally from the mwsc catalogue of kharchenko et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and literature resources as listed in the table 14 .",
    "we use the present sample of 79 ocs to look at abundance trends with cluster s age and galactocentric distance .",
    "figure [ fe_ageoc ] shows the run of [ fe / h ] with age for the full sample of 79 ocs covering ages from 100 myr to 9 gyr with a distinction made between thin , thick disc and halo members .",
    "the age distributions for these components are consistent with distributions for local field stars with the reasonable caveat that the age distribution of ocs is depleted at great ages because clusters are dissolved by internal dynamical effects and galactic tidal forces .",
    "dissolution times are short for small and poorly populated ocs but ocs with intermediate masses ( @xmath13 500 @xmath14 to 1000 @xmath14 ) can survive several gyr , if they are located in the external regions of the disc ( pavani & bica 2007 ) .",
    "a cluster of even @xmath15 may dissolve in less than 2 gyr in the solar vicinity from the frequent encounters with dense molecular clouds ( lamers & gieles 2006 ) . since disruption timescales must be much shorter well inside the solar circle , the survival of old ocs in figure [ fe_ageoc ] suggest that either such ocs were very massive or located exclusively in external ( i.e. , low density ) regions of the galaxy .",
    "metallicity@xmath0age relations for thin and thick disc field stars have been extensively studied ",
    "see , for example , bensby et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2014 ) , reddy et al .",
    "thin disc field stars span the interval [ fe / h ] from about @xmath16 to @xmath17 dex with little to no age dependence .",
    "in contrast , the thick disc is concentrated at sub - solar [ fe / h ] ( say @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) and is composed almost exclusively of stars with ages greater than about 8 gyr with a steep trend of decreasing [ fe / h ] with increasing age .    the sample of thin disc ocs matches that expected from thin disc field stars with the supplementary condition that the youngest clusters have yet to contribute young field stars .",
    "these ocs span the [ fe / h ] range from about @xmath18 to @xmath20 with ages up to almost 10 gyr .",
    "the thick disc ocs have a [ fe / h ] about @xmath21 dex lower than the thin disc ocs with an average age greater than the thin disc ocs .",
    "inspection of the [ fe / h ] versus age suggests that young and old ocs with thin disc kinematics have very similar metallicities and display a flat trend with increasing age with bounds @xmath30.2 dex for almost all ocs as compared with @xmath22 for each cluster of about @xmath23 dex or less .",
    "not surprisingly , we notice a similar behaviour but with a smaller spread of about @xmath30.1 dex for other iron - peak elements sc , v , cr , co and ni over the age range sampled by these thin disc ocs ( reddy et al .",
    "since fe and iron - peak elements are primarily products of type ia supernovae from white dwarfs which exceed the chandrasekhar mass limit , these clusters may formed well after type ia supernovae had begun to make their contribution to the galactic inventory . as the sampled thin disc ocs",
    "have a considerable spread in r@xmath10 ( @xmath135 to 12 kpc ) , it is likely that the observed age@xmath0metallicity relation carries also the signature of metallicity evolution at different r@xmath10s as the galaxy evolved which probably represent the spread in [ fe / h ] at any age over the lifetime of the disc .",
    "the five youngest clusters with ages from 10 to 100 myr serve as an illustrative example of spread in [ fe / h ] caused by the metallicity enrichment at different r@xmath10s in the galaxy ; ocs in the solar vicinity ( blue dots ) , namely ic 2391 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath24 dex , 8.0 kpc , 46 myr ) , ic 2602 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath25 dex , 7.9 kpc , 32 myr ) , ngc 7160 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath26 dex , 8.2 kpc , 19 myr ) are metal - rich than clusters far away from the sun , namely ngc 2345 ( black open square , [ fe / h]=@xmath27 dex , 9.7 kpc , 71 myr ; this study ) , ngc 2234 ( inverted triangle , [ fe / h]=@xmath28 dex , 12.7 kpc , 50 myr ; frinchaboy et al",
    "these clusters because of young ages may not have moved far away from their birthplaces and , thus , represent the chemical composition of gas in those locations in the galactic disc which is compatible with the widely held impression of decreasing [ fe / h ] with increasing r@xmath10 ( friel et al .",

    "of these 28 clusters , 15 clusters have measured chemical abundances from a single star whose membership to the cluster has been assumed based on its presence in the dias et al .",

    "our sample alone constitute about 35% of ocs explored so far with high - resolution spectroscopy and we are the first to provide a homogeneous high - resolution abundance analysis of elements from na to eu for twenty - eight ocs in the radial range r@xmath10=7.7 to 11.3 kpc ; only a few ocs in the literature present abundance estimates for the heavy elements from y to eu .    following the kinematic criteria , we assigned ocs to the thin disc , thick disc or halo stellar populations and examined the age - abundance relations and the variation of [ fe / h ] as a function of r@xmath10 in the galactic disc .",
    "we showed that the resolution of the lack of age@xmath0metallicity relation for ocs , as noted previously by other studies , lies in the incomplete coverage in metallicity compared to that of field stars which cover the range of @xmath01.0 to @xmath430.4 dex in metallicity and an age of a few myr to 13 gyr .    using our homogeneous sample of 79 ocs",
    ", we confirm the results of previous studies that ocs present a constant steep decline of metallicity out to r@xmath10 of 12 kpc and a further flattening out to the entire radial extent of the galactic disc .",
    "but our analysis is the first to demonstrate clearly that such bimodality accompanied by a sudden change in the slope of radial metallicity distribution of ocs at 12 kpc arise from the selection effects ; at r@xmath4612 kpc , all the sampled clusters lie close to the galactic midplane ( @xmath60.5 kpc ) , younger than 1.5 gyr with kinematics typical of thin disc and are constituting a constant steep decline of [ fe / h ] with r@xmath42 while the ocs populating the disc beyond 12 kpc are older with ages from 1.0 to 8.0 gyr , metal - poor by [ fe / h ] @xmath380.2 dex with thick disc kinematics and located away from the midplane ( 0.5@xmath82.5 kpc ) and constitute a shallow gradient over the entire radial extent of the galactic disc followed by a change of slope at 12 kpc .",
    "we further compared the gradients traced by ocs with that of field stars , cepheids and with chemodynamical model predictions .",
    "we demonstrated clearly that the ocs , field stars and cepheids yield consistent radial gradients if the comparison samples are drawn from the similar vertical slices .",
    "the radial metallicity gradient traced by the field stars and cepheids lying close to the midplane ( @xmath60.5 kpc ) are steeper while that measured for field stars located away from the midplane ( 0.5@xmath82.0 kpc ) are shallower over the entire radial extent of the disc and are comparable to similar gradients measured for the sample of ocs .",
    "the chemodynamical models of minchev et al .",
    "( 2013 ) produce a steep gradient for samples of stars younger than 2 gyr and a flat trend for stars older than 2 gyr throughout the radial range 5 to 16 kpc of the disc . in their simulations , a signature of flattening of the radial gradient",
    "arise naturally due to the radial mixing of stars but the young population is hardly affected as the radial mixing operates at a slow pace . as a result , the younger populations are expected to show a steeper gradient than that of the older ones . taking into account the affects of radial mixing",
    ", these simulations fairly predict a steep gradient of @xmath00.058 dex kpc@xmath4 ( r@xmath716@xmath011 kpc ) for the stellar populations younger than 2 gyr and the shallow gradient of old populations which are in fair agreement with such gradients observed for the tracers such as ocs , field stars and cepheids .",
    "finally , we demonstrated through the computation of birthplaces of ocs that the sample of clusters ( ages@xmath29 1.5 gyr and r@xmath4612 kpc ) constituting a steep radial metallicity gradient of slope @xmath00.052@xmath30.011 dex kpc@xmath4 have circular orbits with birthplaces very close their present locations in the galactic midplane .",
    "in contrast , the older clusters populating the outer disc ( r@xmath3912 kpc ) with a measured shallow slope of @xmath00.015@xmath30.007 dex kpc@xmath4 have relatively eccentric orbits but with birthplaces around r@xmath42 of 11 kpc close to the midplane .",
    "our analysis is the first to demonstrate clearly that the orbital eccentricity of all but the three outer disc clusters be 29 , be 75 and saurer 1 has taken them to present locations in the galactic disc from their birthplaces inward of 12 kpc from a medium enriched with very similar metallicity .",
    "moreover , these outer disc clusters also make large excursions away from the galactic midplane , a pleasing result in support of their survival for longer periods of time .",
    "the older , distant clusters be 29 and saurer 1 at a height of 2 kpc and 1.7 kpc , respectively , are of extra - galactic origin while be 75 may be an old genuine galactic cluster on a perturbed orbit or the astrometric data employed in orbit calculations might be erroneous and require further scrutiny .    in the spirit of speculation to encourage further spectroscopic analyses ,",
    "the suggestion is made that the variation of metallicity of ocs with galactocentric distance is a linear function with a constant negative slope over the entire radial extent of the disc but close to the galactic midplane .",
    "the radial gradients become flatter as one moves away from the galactic midplane and for the older ocs .",
    "to test such speculations , it would be useful to explore the chemical content of as many clusters as possible including the young and old ocs covering a wide range in r@xmath10 from 5 to 18 kpc in the disc and a scale height of 0.0 to 3 kpc above the midplane and then to compare the abundance gradients of ocs with those derived from the field stars and cepheids .",
