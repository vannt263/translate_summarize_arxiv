    "[ qp0 ] .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( a ) shows three different quasiparticles with energy near 4@xmath39 . these are highlighted in fig .",
    "[ dsing ] with red triangles . in fig .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( a ) i , a quasiparticle with a low value of @xmath2 is shown .",
    "it is more phonon like being near the linear part of the dispersion . in this case",
    "it has a large amplitude near the center of the condensate .",
    "additionally it has 3 radial nodes and @xmath65=1 . in fig .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( a ) ii , we show a quasiparticle with moderate @xmath2 .",
    "this mode is characterized by @xmath65=5 and 2 radial nodes . finally in fig .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( a ) iii , we show a surface mode with large @xmath2 .",
    "this excitation has 1 radial node ( at 0 ) and @xmath65=11 .",
    "this mode has no amplitude at the center of the condensate .",
    "these three modes illustrate that for an excitation energy held roughly constant , there are several different excitations that can occur .",
    "the lowest @xmath2 mode is phonon like , then at largest @xmath2 mode is a surface excitation .",
    "as one moves between these two extremes , the excitation moves from the center of the trap toward the surface .",
    "this happens by the wavefunction losing radial nodes and increasing the azimuthal quantum number at roughly a constant energy .",
    "one other way to look at the structure of the dispersion relation is to freeze @xmath65 and vary the number of radial nodes .",
    "we have done this for one example with @xmath69 , in fig . [ dsing ] these energies",
    "are marked with black @xmath68s .",
    "they start with large @xmath2 and lower energy .",
    "then as a radial node is added , the @xmath68 moves up in energy and to slightly higher @xmath2 .",
    "we now move to study the quasiparticles with higher energy ( @xmath76 ) , these are shown in fig .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( b ) . in fig .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( b ) i , we show a low @xmath2 mode which is phonon like .",
    "this mode has a large amplitude near the center of the trap and the radial wavefunction has 6 nodes and @xmath65=3 .",
    "this mode is similar to the mode shown in ( a ) ii , in that it has a large amplitude near the center of the trap with a relatively small @xmath65 ( for its energy ) .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( b ) ii shows a mode with moderate @xmath2 and has 3 radial nodes and @xmath65=13 .",
    "it is worth noting that if we follow the curve which contains the modes with 3 radial nodes , we find that it contains the mode shown in ( a ) i. finally , in fig .",
    "[ qp0 ] ( b ) iii we show a mode with large @xmath2 .",
    "this excitation is a surface mode with @xmath65=23 and one radial node at 0 . now that we have characterized the dispersion relation by looking at the particular excitation modes , we move on to look at the dispersion relation and excitations of the 2 component bec .",
    "comparing the one and two component dispersion relations we see that the primary difference is that another quantum number is required to tell us the `` spin '' state of the excitation , this leads to twice as many excitations .",
    "if we classify the modes in cylindrical coordinates the wavefunction now reads @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the spin state of the excitation .",
    "this extra index is of course from the fact that we have gone from a one by one matrix descrbing spin to a two by two matrix . in the miscible example",
    "the modes are classified by the relative motion of the components : in - phase and out - of - phase modes excitations .",
    "therefore spin eigenstates look like @xmath79 .",
    "this is not rigorously true because of the different interaction strengths , @xmath80 .    in fig .",
    "[ dis ] ( a ) we show the dispersion curve of the miscible example ( black dots ) and the single component bec ( brown circles ) .",
    "the 2 component dispersion relation is readily broken into two regimes , particularly at low energy : in - phase and out - of - phase modes . comparing the single component and 2 component dispersion relations",
    ", we see that in - phase modes line up well with single component dispersion .",
    "meaning when components 1 and 2 move together , @xmath81 , they strongly resemble the single component modes .",
    "therefore these modes are then readily classified .",
    "but lower in energy there is another manifold of excitations .",
    "these are out of phase excitations , where components 1 and 2 move opposite to one another , @xmath82 .",
    "these modes can still be easily classified based on their azimuthal symmetry and the number of radial nodes .    for the immiscible system ,",
    "the dispersion relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ dis ] ( b ) .",
    "it is just a mess , this is because there is no longer a symmetry to protect the modes from hybridizing , and it is much harder to classify modes .",
    "it is worth noting that the dispersion relation has roughly the same extent in @xmath2 as the single component dispersion relation .",
    "an interesting addition to this dispersion relation is a set of low energy , large @xmath2 modes which are localized at the interface , these are labeled in fig .",
    "[ dis ] ( b ) .",
    "now that we have examined dispersion relation for the two component system , we will look at several examples of quasiparticles for the miscible and immiscible systems to further understand the structure of their dispersion relations .",

    "the dashed contours have values of : -0.75 , -0.5 , and -0.25 the maximum value of @xmath83 , and solid contours have values of : 0.25 . 0.5 , and 0.75 the maximum value of @xmath84 .",
    "[ qp1 ] ( a ) i shows an in - phase , @xmath65=1 phonon like excitation with 3 radial nodes .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines of component 1 overlap the solid ( dashed ) lines of component 2 .",
    "this mode is very similar to the one in fig [ qp0 ] ( a ) i. fig .",
    "[ qp1 ] ( a ) ii shows an excitation with radial 2 nodes , @xmath65=4 , and the components in - phase .",
    "these two modes are both in - phase modes and strongly resemble modes in the single component system . fig .",
    "[ qp1 ] ( a ) iii shows an excitation with radial 3 nodes and @xmath65=5 , but for this mode the components move out - of - phase . the solid (",

    ", we are in the lower manifold of the dispersion relation , which is essentially all out - of - phase modes at low energy .",
    "this mode has a large @xmath2 value for its energy .",

    "we now find that there are excitations that mix the components , for example the amplitude of @xmath83 has a large amplitude in condensate 2 .",
    "there are `` partisan '' excitations where the amplitude of an excitation overlaps strongly with its own condensate and not the other condensate .",
    "another prominent theme will be hybridizing of modes which resemble modes from the miscible system .",

    "[ qp2 ] ( a ) i shows a mode that looks like an @xmath65=1 phonon with 2 radial nodes , like those shown in fig . [ qp0](a ) i or fig [ qp1](a ) i. the excitations are partisan and localized to their condensate .",
    "[ qp2 ] ( a ) ii shows a mode that is not readily characterized .",
    "it looks like a breathing mode where excitation of 1 ( 2 ) moves from the middle to the outside of condensate 2 ( 1 ) , meaning it is a mixing excitation where the bulk of the excitation is in the other condensate .",
    "there is a large component of excitation on the surface of the condensate .",
    "[ qp2 ] ( a ) iii shows another mode that is not readily characterized .",
    "it looks like a slosh mode along the interface , but it also mixes the components : the excitation of 1 ( 2 ) moves back and forth along the interface in condensate 2 ( 1 ) .",
    "[ qp2 ] ( a ) iv shows an interface mode with some surface character .",

    "they range from equal parts of component 1 and 2 to single component dominated .",
    "one other means to classify a mode is the overlap of the excitation with its condensate .",
