    "it has been more than 25 years since the first peculiar velocity of a cluster of galaxies was reported ( gudehus 1973 ) , more than 20 years since peculiar velocities were first referenced to the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) ( gudehus 1978 ) , accurately measured for the first time by smoot , gorenstein , and muller ( 1977 ) , and more than 10 years since dressler _ et al . _",
    "( 1987 ) first reported that galaxian peculiar velocities were correlated in direction .",
    "the first part of this time period , however , was marked by the fixed idea that the universal expansion was `` quiet '' ( visvanathan and sandage 1977 and references therein ; tammann 1984 ) .",
    "tammann ( 1984 ) , for example , claimed that my 1978 peculiar velocity for virgo was `` impossible in size _ and _ sign '' .",
    "these early contrary claims have been explained ( gudehus 1989b , 1991 ) as due to _",
    "i ) _ a neglect to reference redshifts to the mbr frame and _ ii ) _ a variety of systematic effects .",
    "the current view is that peculiar velocities exist at some level out to 15,000 , but with some observers finding significantly smaller values at greater distance ( riess _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; giovanelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) than others ( gudehus 1989b ; lucey _ el al .",
    "_ 1991 ; bothun _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; mould _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; hudson _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) ; willick ( 1999 ) , and one group ( lauer & postman 1994 ) finding a significantly different vector direction for the most distant clusters .    in this paper i will use relative distance moduli taken from my previous studies , solve for a preferred set of revised cluster peculiar velocities , and compute an average direction for the cosmic flow .",
    "i will then , from an n - body simulation based on masses assigned to clusters of known redshift , calculate predicted peculiar velocities for the lg and virgo .",
    "the data sets used in this study comprise @xmath3 * magnitudes ( gudehus 1989b ) for ten clusters , reduced galaxian radius parameters , @xmath4 , ( gudehus 1991 ) for four clusters , and relative magnitudes of seventeen selected clusters computed as weighted averages from several independent distance indicators ( gudehus 1995 ) ( including first - ranked magnitude and richness - corrected nuclear magnitudes ) .",
    "the @xmath3 * and @xmath4 data were combined and fitted by nonlinear least squares to the redshift - magnitude diagram with @xmath5 assumed to be 0.5 , luminosity evolution assumed to be 0.75 magnitudes per unit @xmath6 , and all redshifts corrected to the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) results for the lg s motion relative to the mbr ( smoot _ et al .",
    "the nearest five clusters were given zero weight in the fit since their peculiar velocities produce substantial deviations from the curve and are nonrandomly distributed .",
    "the standard deviation about the curve fitted to the remaining points is 0.064 mag .",
    "peculiar velocities were derived from the selected clusters in a similar way and include three duplicates from the first set , i.e. , virgo , fornax , and hydra i , which were given zero weight in the fit .",
    "although the standard deviation about the fit is larger , i.e. , 0.11 mag , than for the first set , the preferred peculiar velocities of the duplicates are taken from the second set since in that set each cluster s point represents a weighted average of several independent distance indicators ( three for fornax and hydra i , and six for virgo ) .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] lists for each cluster , the peculiar velocity observations .",
    "column 1 gives the identity , column 2 the redshift velocity relative to the mbr , column 3 the distance modulus relative to virgo consistent with the peculiar velocities , and column 4 the radial peculiar velocity , respectively .",
    ".cluster peculiar velocity data .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > , > \" , ]     figure  [ fig-4 ] shows a smoothed false color plot of the mass assigned to the clusters closer than @xmath7 and which lie within 45  of the best - fitting plane through the eight nearby clusters .",
    "since the best fitting @xmath8 is greater than the value based on known cluster masses , i.e. , 2.1 , increasing amounts of mass are contained outside the richer clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig-5 ] shows how the model velocity for the lg depends on upper redshift limit .",
    "most of the accelerating masses lie within about 40@xmath2 mpc ( @xmath9 ) , but more distant clusters , such as those at 150@xmath2 mpc ( @xmath10 ) contribute as well .",
    "convergence to a steady value occurs only after a distance of about 450@xmath2 mpc ( @xmath11 ) is reached .",
    "both the magnitude and direction of the observed average radial peculiar velocity are consistent with the set of eight clusters participating in the same flow that the lg moves with .",
    "gudehus s ( 1995 ) observation that when the measured infall to virgo of 52 is used to compute the lg s undisturbed velocity vector , the projected radial velocity precisely matches virgo s measured radial peculiar velocity , demonstrates that at least virgo participates in the flow .",
    "other clusters in that study also showed evidence of flow participation .",
    "simulations for gravitationally induced peculiar motions in an expanding universe with model parameters set equal to reasonable values drawn from the literature give acceptable agreement with the observed velocities of the lg and virgo .",
    "the sparseness of the cluster catalogue prevents extending the calculation to more distant clusters at this time .",
