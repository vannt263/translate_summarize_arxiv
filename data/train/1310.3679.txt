    "in this paper we first establish interpolation properties for function spaces that are related to mixed boundary value problems . afterwards , from this and a fundamental result of sneiberg @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) we deduce elliptic and parabolic regularity results for second order , divergence operators .    in recent years",
    "it became manifest that the appearance of mixed boundary conditions is not the exception when modelling real world problems , but more the rule .",
    "for instance , in semiconductor theory , models with only pure dirichlet or pure neumann conditions are meaningless , see @xcite .",
    "one geometric concept , which proved of value for the analysis of mixed boundary value problems , is that introduced by grger in @xcite ( compare also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it demands , roughly speaking , that the domain @xmath0 under consideration is a lipschitz domain and that the dirichlet part @xmath1 of the boundary is locally separated from the rest by a lipschitzian hypersurface within @xmath2 . within this geometric framework ,",
    "several properties for differential operators , well - known from smooth constellations , were re - established .",
    "this concerns elliptic regularity ( in particular hlder continuity ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , maximal parabolic regularity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and interpolation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we impose more general conditions on the domain and on the dirichlet boundary part @xmath3 ; notably , we dispense the lipschitz property of the domain . in particular , the domain may touch itself from outside , see the examples in figures  [ fig - meissel-1 ] and [ fig - meissel ] below that are included in our framework .",
    "note that the situation in figure  [ fig - meissel ] is not an artificial one : the reader may think of a body for which @xmath4 and the two striped areas form an extremely thin , but highly conducting contact @xmath3 , to which an external source ( e.g. heat or electrical ) is applied . if the body is formed by a much less conducting material , the distribution of heat / charge within the body is subject of an elliptic / parabolic equation with dirichlet conditions on @xmath3",

    "does not belong to @xmath0 , and carries  together with the striped parts  the dirichlet condition . ]",
    "our geometric framework is the following .",
    "the dirichlet boundary part @xmath3 only has to be a @xmath5-set in the sense of jonsson / wallin .",
    "this can be seen as an  extremely weak  compatibility condition between @xmath3 and @xmath6 . for the complement of the dirichlet boundary part ,",
    "the crucial feature is the local extendability of sobolev functions . within this geometrical framework",
    "we prove the following : the spaces @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "definition [ d-1 ] ) @xmath81,\\infty[$ ] interpolate according to the same rules as if one _ formally _ replaces the domain @xmath0 by a ball @xmath9 and the boundary part @xmath1 by the empty set ( compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.3.1 ) ) .",
    "based on the interpolation results we reproduce grger s elliptic regularity result from @xcite , namely that an arbitrary elliptic divergence operator @xmath10 provides a topological isomorphism between a space @xmath7 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 close to @xmath13  but now for a much broader class of domains and dirichlet boundary parts .",
    "let us emphasize that the  matrix valued  coefficient function @xmath14 of the operator needs only be bounded and elliptic , cf .",
    "assumption  [ a - coeff ] below .",
    "note that the main result from @xcite was used in some tens of papers in order to treat ( mostly two dimensional ) problems , stemming from real world applications . having this regularity result at hand , we succeed in proving that divergence operators of this type generate analytic semigroups on spaces @xmath11 , as long as @xmath12 is chosen close to @xmath15 . clearly , this can serve as the adequate instrument for the treatment of corresponding parabolic problems , compare e.g. @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) , @xcite .",
    "one of our main technical tools is the version of the now classical restriction / extension theorem of jonsson / wallin ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "v.1 thm.1 ) ) for the limit case of lipschitz functions , see proposition [ p - jw ] below .    throughout",
    "we stick to the condition that @xmath3 is a @xmath16-set , which in several instances can in fact be weakened . since our motivation for this paper comes from the applications , our aim is to describe a very general but nevertheless easily accessible geometric constellation that allows to deduce our results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we introduce some preliminaries . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we reproduce interpolation within the family of spaces @xmath171,\\infty[}}$ ] , and , as a consequence , in @xmath181,\\infty[}$ ] . rather unexpectedly",
    ", this follows directly from the results of jonsson / wallin , combined with a classical interpolation principle for complemented subspaces and the existence of an extension operator @xmath19 , which is uniform in @xmath12 .",
    "since the existence of an extension operator is thus crucial for our approach , in section  [ extens ] we first establish construction principles for extension operators .",
    "these , together with our conditions on the geometry of @xmath0 near @xmath6 , then indeed assure their existence . a simple pre - processing , which essentially improves the applicability of our setting , is described in lemmas  [ l - modigeb ] and [ l - exten0 ] .",
    "it allows to pass from the original domain @xmath0 to another domain @xmath20 whose boundary is smaller and , in most cases , a more regular one .",
    "it is exactly this what enables also the treatment of geometric settings like in figure  [ fig - meissel ] , compare @xcite for a similar , but different approach  there even applied to higher order sobolev spaces .",
    "section [ sec4 ] contains the above mentioned elliptic and parabolic regularity results . in section  [ sec_systems ]",
    "we extend the discussion to a class of elliptic systems comprising the equations for linear elasticity and for cosserat models . relying on the interpolation",
    "results it is shown that the corresponding differential operators provide topological isomorphisms between @xmath21 and @xmath22 for suitable @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , under an additional symmetry assumption on the coefficient tensor , uniform estimates are derived for classes of coefficient tensors satisfying certain uniform bounds . since in the case of systems",
    "the coercivity of the operator not necessarily entails the positivity of the coefficient tensor , the pointwise arguments from @xcite have to be modified and transferred to arguments dealing with the whole operator . in this way also",
    "the results from @xcite are extended to more general geometric situations .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - appl ] , we point out a broad class of possible applications for our regularity results .",

    "as already mentioned in remark  [ r - remain ] , the condition of the extendability for @xmath7 within the same class is an abstract one which should be supported by geometric conditions on @xmath0 and on @xmath3 .",
