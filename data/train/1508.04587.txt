    "the inherent simplicity encoded in the pattern of collective states in nuclei , highlights the role of underlying symmetries in explaining their structure .",
    "notable examples are the u(5 ) , su(3 ) and o(6 ) dynamical symmetries of the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite , which act as benchmarks for spherical - vibrator , axial - rotor and @xmath0-unstable types of collective motion .",
    "each dynamical symmetry ( ds ) provides a physically transparent analytic solution and good quantum numbers for all states of the system .",
    "the majority of nuclei , however , exhibit strong deviations from these solvable limits .",
    "often , in spite of the required symmetry - breaking terms in the hamiltonian , some eigenstates appear to obey the symmetry while other states do not . to accommodate such more realistic scenarios , one needs to enlarge the traditional concept of exact symmetries . in the present contribution",
    ", we discuss two such generalizations , partial and quasi dynamical symmetries , and show their ability to characterize the remaining regularity amidst a complicated ( at times chaotic ) environment of other states , a situation encountered in a nuclear shape - phase transition .",
    "partial dynamical symmetry ( pds ) corresponds to a situation in which only part of the eigenspectrum is solvable and/or has good symmetry - based quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "algorithms for constructing hamiltonians with pds are available  @xcite and empirical evidence for their occurrence in a wide range of nuclei , has been presented  [ 2 - 8 ] .",
    "pds reflects the purity of selected eigenstates with respect to a ds basis .",
    "its quantitative measure is based on the concept of shannon entropy .",
    "consider an eigenfunction of the ibm hamiltonian , @xmath1 , with angular momentum @xmath2 , and denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 its expansion coefficients in the u(5 ) and su(3 ) bases , respectively . here",

    "quasi dynamical symmetry ( qds ) corresponds to the situation for which selected eigenstates of a hamiltonian with broken symmetries , continue to exhibit characteristic properties ( _ e.g. _ , energy and b(e2 ) ratios ) of the closet ds limit  @xcite .",
    "this `` apparent '' symmetry is due to a coherent mixing of irreps , imprinting an adiabatic motion  @xcite .    in case of su(3)-qds ,",
    "the coherent mixing arises when the su(3 ) expansion coefficients , @xmath4 , are approximately independent of @xmath2 for a class of states .",
    "such strong correlations between different @xmath2 states , signal a common intrinsic structure and the formation of a rotational band . focusing , for example , on the @xmath23 , members of @xmath24 bands , given a @xmath25 state , among the ensemble of possible states , we associate with it those @xmath26 states which show the maximum correlation , @xmath27 . a unit value , @xmath28 , for the pearson coefficient implies a perfect correlation . to quantify the amount of coherence ( hence of su(3)-qds ) in the chosen set of states",

    "the presence of terms in the hamiltonian with incompatible ( non - commuting ) symmetries , has a profound effect on the possible emergence of quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) .",
    "the latter are structural changes in the properties of the system induced by a variation of parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "such ground state transformations are manifested empirically in nuclei as transitions between different shapes  @xcite .",
    "the competing interactions that drive the qpt can affect dramatically the nature of the dynamics and , in some cases , lead to an intricate interplay of order and chaos  [ 13 - 15 ] .",
    "even in such circumstances , generalized symmetries such as pds and qds can endure , and be assigned to particular regular multiplets of states which survive amidst a complicated environment of other states  @xcite .     for @xmath33 and @xmath34 eigenstates of @xmath35 , eq .",

    "such ordered band - structures persist to energies above the barrier and are not present in the disordered ( chaotic ) portions of the peres lattice . at low - energy , in the vicinity of the spherical well , one can also detect multiplets of states with @xmath45 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , typical of quadrupole excitations with @xmath66 of a spherical shape .",
