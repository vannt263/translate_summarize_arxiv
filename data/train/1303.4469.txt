    "string theory is the most promising candidate for producing a unified theory of the four fundamental forces of nature @xcite . before the so - called second revolution of string theory , five kinds of theories ( typei / iia / iib / heterotic so / heterotic e8 ) were known to be consistent string theories , which were formulated in perturbation in terms of a genus expansion of the world - sheet @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the dirichlet branes ( d - branes ) was a turning point for string theorists , showing that all perturbative string theories are related non - perturbatively .",
    "d - branes have been found to be non - perturbative solitonic states of string theory and are characterized as hypersurfaces on which open fundamental strings can terminate with the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "d - branes are the most fundamental tool for studying the non - perturbative dynamics of string theory , which would enable the solving of the problems such as the dimensionality of the universe and the generation number of quarks and leptons    in some field theories , topological solitons consisting of a complex of domain walls and strings have been proposed as a prototype of the original d - brane in string theory , referred to as the  d - brane soliton \" .",
    "the d - brane soliton was first discussed by gauntlett _",
    "et al_. based on the hyper - khler nonlinear sigma model ( nl@xmath0 m ) @xcite . a similar argument",
    "was extended to abelian or non - abelian gauge theory with finite gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "all possible composite solitons of domain walls , vortices , monopoles , and instantons , including d - brane solitons in field theoretical models are reviewed in ref .",
    "the correspondence between the d - brane in string theory and that in field theory was established by the following facts @xcite : ( i ) the branes should have a localized u(1 ) nambu - goldstone mode , which can be rewritten as the u(1 ) gauge field on its world volume . the effective description of the collective motion of the d - branes is then given by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action in the low energy regime @xcite .",
    "the dbi action is a nonlinear action of the scalar field ( corresponding to the transverse position of the d - brane ) and the u(1 ) gauge field @xcite .",
    "( ii ) vortex lines attached to the domain wall are analogous to fundamental strings because their endpoints are electrically charged and identical to solitons known as  bions \" in the dbi action @xcite .",
    "based on these findings , laboratory experiments of d - brane physics have been proposed that exploit the fact that some aspects of these field theoretical models are closely related to the theory of condensed matter phenomena , and thus there are several systems appearing in nature which can be said to admit analogs of d - branes .",
    "the purpose of the analogy argument is to find a way to observe at least some parts of the original complex theory in cosmology or high energy physics by simulating the analogous phenomena in condensed matter experiments . to date , d - branes have only been a theoretical hypothesis and it is not clear whether or not they can be used to describe nature or not .",
    "therefore , it is important to simulate d - brane physics in a laboratory to raise the practical applicability of this hypothesis and to further develop d - brane physics .",
    "for example , analogues of  branes \" have been discussed in an experiment on superfluid @xmath1he @xcite , where brane  anti - brane collision was simulated using the boundary between @xmath2he - a and @xmath2he - b phases in a well controlled manner ; the brane  anti - brane collision could explain the big bang in brane cosmology , after which lower - dimensional branes , e.g. , cosmic strings , remain as relics .",
    "however , their exact correspondence to d - branes in string theory was not clarified in ref .",
    "in other systems , e.g. , ferromagnets , it is difficult to create and observe three - dimensional topological defects experimentally , so this kind of study has not yet been reported .",
    "recently , we reported that an analogue of a d - brane can be realized in ultra - cold atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and the experimental verification of various d - brane dynamics could be possible @xcite .",
    "the domain wall in two - component becs can mimic the fundamental properties of the d - brane , because the theoretical formulation in two - component bec can be mapped to the nl@xmath0 m by introducing a pseudospin representation of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "it can then be shown that the domain wall in a two - component bec has a localized u(1 ) nambu - goldstone mode , which is related to the local u(1 ) gauge field on the wall as a necessary degree of freedom for the effective description with the dbi action of a d - brane @xcite .",
    "thus , the resultant wall - vortex composite solitons could possess the characters ( i ) and ( ii ) described above and correspond to the d - branes in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the domain wall and the vortex can be identified as the d - brane and the fundamental string , respectively .",
    "compared to the above systems , two - component becs have a great advantage for exploring d - brane physics , because several experimental techniques to create , control , and observe the topological defects have been very well established @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the correspondence of topological solitons between bec systems and gauge theoretical models to clarify the similarities and differences .",
    "we study various topological solitons such as vortices , domain walls , and their complexes , i.e. , d - brane solitons , in the abelian  multi - higgs model , which is a similar formulation to the two - component gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model that governs the dynamics of becs within the mean - field level .",
    "the gp model corresponds to the strong gauge coupling limit of the abelian - higgs model , where the gauge field is not an independent dynamical degree of freedom and is consistently determined by the configuration of the matter ( higgs ) fields .",
    "we also focus on the topological structure of the wall - vortex connecting points in d - brane solitons . in a field theoretical model",
    ", these points form defects called  boojum \" as the negative binding energy of vortices and a wall , and a half of the negative charge of a single monopole @xcite .",
    "boojums are known as point defects existing upon the surface of the ordered phase ; the name was first introduced to physics by mermin in the context of superfluid @xmath2he @xcite .",
    "boojums can exist in different physical systems , such as the interface separating a and b phases of superfluid @xmath2he @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , the langmuir monolayers at air - water interfaces @xcite , multi - component becs with a spatially tuned interspecies interaction @xcite , and high density quark matter @xcite . in the present model",

    "the vortices attached to the wall are identified as fundamental strings since their endpoints are electrically charged and identical to bions in the dbi action @xcite .",
