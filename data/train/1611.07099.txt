    "models of quasistatic elasto - plasticity date back to prandtl s model of an elastic - ideal plastic element , which can be thought of as a cascade connection of an ideal hook s spring and a coulomb dry friction element .",
    "this simple model accounts for two important effects , saturation of stress with increasing deformation ( strain ) and hysteresis in the stress - strain relationship .",
    "hysteresis is a manifestation of the fact that stress at a moment @xmath0 is not a single - valued function of the concurrent deformation value , but rather a function of state of the elasto - plastic material , which depends on the history of variations of the deformation prior to the instant @xmath0 .",
    "two parameters of prandtl s model are the stiffness @xmath1 of the spring and the maximal spring force @xmath2 ( which equals the friction force in the sliding regime for quasistatic deformations ) .    in order to account for complex relationship between deformation and stress in real materials ,",
    "prandtl proposed to model the constitutive law of the material with a parallel connection of elastic - ideal plastic elements .",
    "a similar idea was developed by ishlinskii who modeled individual fibers of wire ropes by prandtl s elements . in the prandtl - ishlinskii phenomenological model , a finite or infinite set of prandtl s elements ( characterized by different values @xmath3 of parameters of stiffness and maximal stress )",
    "are all subject to the same deformation @xmath4 , and the total force ( or stress ) @xmath5 is proportional to the sum of all spring forces .",
    "the operator that maps the time series @xmath4 of the deformation ( input ) to the time series of stress @xmath5 ( output ) , given a set of initial stresses of all the springs ( initial state ) , is known as the prandtl - ishlinskii ( pi ) operator in one - dimensional elasto - plasticity .",
    "thanks to the set of good mathematical properties of this operator ( see , for example , @xcite ) , its equivalent counterparts have been used in several other disciplines including tribology ( maxwell - slip friction model ) , damage counting and fatigue estimation ( the rain flow counting method ) , and , more recently , modeling constitutive laws of smart materials such as piezo - electric and magnetostrictive materials and shape memory alloys .",
    "one useful property , called the composition rule , is that a composition of pi operators is also a pi operator and , as a consequence , the inverse operator for a pi operator is another pi operator .",
    "furthermore , a pi operator and its inverse admit an efficient analytic and numerical implementation .",
    "this property , in particular , underpins the design of compensation - based control schemes for microactuators and sensors , which use smart materials for energy conversion .",
    "another fact that facilitates modeling various constitutive laws with the pi operator , and is also central to this paper , is stated by the representation theorem , which allows one to determine whether a set of input - output data can be modeled by a pi operator and , moreover , equips one with an algorithm for identifying parameters of a pi operator from a simple measurement procedure .",
    "the representation theorem states that if ( a ) the input - output relationship between deformation and stress is _ rate - independent _ that maps the time series @xmath4 of deformation to the time series @xmath5 of stress commutes with any increasing transformation @xmath6 of time , @xmath7 . ] ; ( b ) hysteresis loops corresponding to periodic inputs are _ closed _ ; and , ( c ) every hysteresis loop is _ centrally symmetric _ , then @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a pi operator .",
    "furthermore , if properties ( a)(c ) are satisfied , then starting from the initial state in which all the springs are relaxed , applying an increasing input ( deformation ) @xmath10 , and measuring the corresponding increasing output @xmath11 , one obtains the so called _ loading curve _ @xmath12 , which completely defines the pi operator @xmath9 on the class of all continuously varying inputs @xmath13\\to\\mathbb{r}$ ] via an explicit formula involving @xmath14 and a sequence of local running extremum values of @xmath10 ( see below ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same measurement of the loading curve is used in nonlinear elasticity to identify the non - hysteretic relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath15 by the nemytskii operator @xmath16 .",
    "the main premise of the of the phenomenological pi model is that prandtl s elements do not interact .",
    "the model of moreau addresses a much more general setting , in which an arbitrary spatial configuration of nodes connected by prandtl s elastic - ideal plastic springs deforms quasistatically ( the balance of forces at each node is zero at all times ) in response to either ( i ) external forcing applied at a selected set of nodes or ( ii ) controlled variation of the distance between nodes for a selected set of pairs of nodes , or ( iii ) simultaneous application of the two types of inputs above . in this setting , the relationship between the vector of stresses of individual springs and the input is complicated and is described by the differential inclusion ( or , equivalently , a variational inequality ) , which is known as the moreau _ sweeping process_. this process has a nice kinematic interpretation , in which variations of the input induce the motion and deformation of the convex domain @xmath17 of admissible stresses , and the set @xmath18 drags a point representing the vector of stresses according to a natural kinematic rule .    here",
    ", we consider an ( arbitrary ) configuration of prandtl s elastic - ideal plastic springs controlled by one scalar - valued input - the distance @xmath19 between two selected nodes , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding sweeping process belongs to a special class known as a ( multidimensional ) play operator with a unidirectional input .",
    "even for this setting , the relationship between the input @xmath19 and the stress @xmath22 of any given spring can be quite complicated . in particular , hysteresis loops corresponding to a periodically varying @xmath23 can be non - closed , thus violating property ( b ) of the pi operator stated above . on the other hand , there are multiple examples of topologies of the spring configuration for which the relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a pi operator @xmath25 for every @xmath26 ( as well as the total reaction force at the node a , and at the node b , is related to @xmath23 via a pi operator ) .",
    "in particular , such examples can be constructed using the composition property of pi operators .    in this paper , we consider the following question : under which assumptions the moreau sweeping process driven by a scalar - valued input @xmath19 is equivalent to a pi operator ?",
    "the answer will be given in geometric terms involving a vector - valued analog of the loading curve , which we define for the sweeping process .",
    "we show that if this curve and the domain @xmath18 of admissible stresses satisfy simple geometric conditions , then the reaction force of the system of coupled prandtl s elements responds to the input @xmath19 exactly in the same way as the reaction force of a system of decoupled prandtl s elements of a certain effective pi model .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 for each spring of the moreau model , where @xmath28 is an appropriate projection of the loading curve of the moreau model in the space of stresses .",
    "in other words , we perform a reduction of the more complex model of moreau to a simpler affective pi model when such reduction is possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present an outline of models of moreau and prandtl - ishlinskii . in section",
    "[ main ] , the main reduction theorem is proved .",
    "section [ discussion ] contains some discussion .",
    "in particular , we show that any moreau model obtained by a small perturbation of a pi model satisfies the conditions of the main theorem and hence is reducible to to an effective pi model .",
    "the paper ends with a summary of results and a few concluding remarks .",
    "following the model of moreau , let us consider an arrangement of @xmath29 nodes , some of which are connected by elastic - ideal plastic springs , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a one - dimensional arrangement ( see remark [ ? ? ] ) .",
    "that is , all the nodes lie on a straight line ( the @xmath30-axis ) and the springs , as well as spring forces , are elongated along this line at all times .",
    "the coordinate of node @xmath26 will be denoted @xmath31 .",
    "it is assumed that there is a configuration @xmath32 called the zero configuration , in which the springs experience zero stress , and we consider deformations of the springs relative to this configuration .",
    "the deformation of the spring connecting nodes @xmath26 and @xmath33 is denoted by @xmath34 : @xmath35 and the force ( stress ) of this spring is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "this arrangement of springs can be associated with a non - directed graph @xmath37 with the nodes associated with graph s vertices and springs associated with graph s edges . without loss of generality ,",
    "this graph is assumed to be connected .",
    "by @xmath38 , we denote the set of indices @xmath39 such that @xmath40 whenever there is a spring connecting the nodes @xmath26 and @xmath33 . here and henceforth ,",
    "we agree that @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath40 .",
    "the general moreau sweeping process models a quasistatic response of the system of springs to external controls ( inputs ) .",
    "there are two types of admissible controls : ( a ) an external force @xmath43 applied to a node @xmath26 ; and , ( b ) a _ moving affine constraint _ that prescribes a distance @xmath44 between a pair of nodes @xmath26 and @xmath33 at all times .",
    "multiple moving constraints and external forces may be applied simultaneously at several pairs of nodes and nodes , respectively . however , in this paper , we consider a system with one control . to be specific ,",
    "we choose to consider a system of springs controlled by one moving constraint .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that this constraint defines the distance between nodes @xmath45 and @xmath29 and that these nodes are not connected by a spring : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a given function of @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we note that moreau s theory equally applies to configurations , where a pair of nodes can be connected by multiple springs . in this case , @xmath37 is a multigraph .      in the models of moreau and prandtl - ishlinskii , the stress @xmath51 and deformation @xmath52 of each spring",
