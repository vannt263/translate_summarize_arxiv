    "the current cosmological paradigm predicts a hierachical building up of the structure . this scenario has largely supported by observations in the local and high redshift universe .",
    "however , few but important descrinpances remain to be explanied such as the inner distribution of dark matter in small haloes , the origin of the high baryonic content and metallicity of the intercluster medium , etc ( shanks 2004 ) .",
    "most of these open problems requires the comprehensive understanding of galaxy formation , including all the involved scales .",
    "numerical simulations have played an important role in understanding and proving the connection between theory and observations at different scales .",
    "however , the modelling of small scale physical processes such as gas cooling , star formation and chemical evolution within a cosmological framework presents different difficulties because of our poor understanding of the relevant physics and numerical limitations .",
    "in particular , only recently chemical evolution has started to be treated within cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( yepes et al .",
    "1998 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ; mosconi et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the dramatic building up of observational evidences on chemical properties of the stellar population and interstellar medium in the universe has proved to have a significant impact on the study of galaxy formation .",
    "chemical elements are produced in the stellar interior and ejected in a pacific or violent way after characteristic timescales determined by stellar evolution .",
    "afterwards , these elements can be mixed up by mergers and interactions .",
    "it is also important to notice that the metal production is directly linked to the star formation history which can be also affected by the environment ( barton et al .",
    "2000 ; lambas et al . 2003 ; balogh et al .",
    "2004 ) . as a consequence",
    ", it is expected that chemical patterns store information of the process of galaxy formation ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "another important motivation to include a chemical treatment in galaxy formation models is related to the fact that baryons cool according to their metallicity .",
    "sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) showed that a gas cloud with solar metallicity cools at a rate of up to few orders of magnitude more efficiently than a primordial gas cloud .",
    "hence , the enrichment of the interstellar medium can have dynamical consequences and affect the formation of the structure .    in this work ,",
    "we present first results of detail treatement of chemical evolution in gadget2 ( springel & hernquist 2002 ) based on the implementation of mosconi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize the main important aspects of the chemical code .",
    "section 3 shows the first results and section 4 presents the conclusions .",
    "the chemical model has been implemented within gadget2 ( springel & hernquist 2002 ) which is based on a modified version of sph that conserves entropy ( energy and angular momentum ) .",
    "stars are formed according to a probability function defined by the relation between cooling and dynamical time ( see also lia et al .",
    "2001 ) . a standard salpeter initial mass function has been assumed .",
    "supernovae ii are considered to form from stars with @xmath2 and to produce metals according to woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) yields .",
    "supernova ia are assumed to originate from binary systems following the model of thielemann et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . we have assumed a random sampling of the lifetime of binary systems in the range 0.1 - 5 gyrs .",
    "chemical elements are distributed within gas neighbouring particles by using a spline kernel function . in order to estimate the correct environment of stars when sn explode we re -",
    "calculate the gaseous neighbours of the stellar particles each time elements are released . in this implementation",
    "we have not included the treatment of energy feedback .",
    "we run cosmological tests of @xmath3-cdm cosmologies consistent with the concordance model ( @xmath4 , @xmath5=0.3 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the simulations correspond to a volume box of @xmath7 mpc ( @xmath8 ) with @xmath9 particles .",
    "three different runs were performed using different cooling functions : solar , primordial and metal - dependent .",
    "the cosmological simulations are analyzed from a global point of view and then , by identifying the gravitational bounded structures . in figure 1 ( left panel )",
    "we show the comoving star formation @xmath10 and metal production @xmath11 rates for the three runs with solar ( solid lines ) , primordial ( dashed lines ) and metal - dependent ( dotted - dashed lines ) cooling functions .",
    "we can see that the largest difference is found for the run with fixed solar cooling and for @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath10 of the metal - dependent cooling run can be up to @xmath13 lower than that of the solar cooling test , and up to @xmath14 higher than the primordial cooling run .",
    "similar relations are found for the metal production rate @xmath11 .",
    "figure 1 ( right panel ) shows the fraction of gas with @xmath15 k for the three runs , with the largest gas fraction associated to the primordial cooling run , as expected .",
    "the difference between primordial and metal - dependent cooling are localized in the densest regions .    at @xmath16 we identified galaxy - like objects ( glos ) at their virial radius by combining the friends - of - friends algorithm with a density contrast method in the three simulations ( with solar , primordial and metal dependent cooling ) .",
    "we constructed the star formation history of the glos and analyzed the chemical properties of their stellar population and interstellar medium . in figure",
    "2a we show the sfr history of a typical glo in the three runs . in the small box we have plotted the ratio of the sfr of the solar and metal - dependent cooling to that of the primordial one .",
    "we can see that the differences are important for @xmath17 , but do not present a regular behavior .",
    "this suggests that the non - linear evolution of the structure determines complicate star formation history and chemical patterns that can produce non - linear responses to the characteristics of the cooling functions .",
    "our model will allow us to try to understand the link between the dynamical evolution and the star formation history and chemical patterns , by studying the particular history of evolution of glos in different environments .",
    "it was shown by tissera , lambas & abadi ( 1997 ) that the combination of the history of star formation with models of population synthesis models results in a powerful tool to cnonect theory with observations .",
    "the treatment of the chemical enrichment in the simulations improve the technique since each simulated stellar population has its age and metallicity estimated consistently with the history of formation in a hierarchical scenario . with this new chemical code , we can also assess the effects of cooling the gas according to its metallicity . for this purpose , we constructed the synthetic spectral distribution of the glos but combining the seds of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , bc03 ) according to the metallicity and age of stars .",
    "we also estimated the simulated spectra ( ss ) of the glos by assuming fixed metallicity at @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the seds of bc03 . in figure",
    "2b we show the ss for the glos of  [ sed - glo1]a for the three runs .",
    "note that the ss has been calculated with the same sfr history (  [ sed - glo1]a , solid line ) . from this figure",
    ", we can see that assuming a low fixed metallicity leads to a very different energy distribution . for this glo ,",
    "the real ss is more similar to that produced by assuming fixed solar metallicity .",
    "we also analyzed the simulated spectra for the same glo in the three runs ( solar , primordial and metal dependent cooling ) , and estimated the ss by using the full information on age and metallicity .",
    "hence , in this case we will looking at the impact of different gas cooling on the star formation and chemical history through the differences in the energy distribution .",
    "figure 3 we show the evolution of the ss for the glo of figure 2 in the three runs .",
    "as it can be seen , the glos in the solar cooling run exhibits the more luminous spectra since because of the high efficient cooling , a large fraction of stars formed quickly before the gas has time to enriched . in the case of the corresponding glo in the runs with primoridal and metal",
    "dependent cooling , the interstellar medium has time to get enriched by previous star generations .",
    "hence , in this case , the ss of the glo metal - dependent cooling run is more similar to that obtained from the primordial one .",
    "we have incorporated a chemical evolution algorithm within gadget2 which allows the description of the enrichment of baryons within a cosmological framework .",
    "a first analysis shows that in @xmath3-cdm scenarios , the comoving star formation rate could be underestimated by up to @xmath20 if the primordial cooling function is adopted .",
    "however , within individual galactic systems it is complicated to disentangle the effects of cooling the gas consistently with its metallicity owing to the non - linear growth of the structure which affects the star formation , chemical histories and the mixing of metals in a non - linear way .",
    "first results show that the star formation history could be either underestimated or overestimated by an order of magnitude depending on the particular history path .",
    "we also show the simulated spectra obtained by combining the age and metallicity information of stars in the simulation with the seds of bruzual & charlot ( 2003).future works will focus on the study of the link between the characteristic of the spectra and history of evolution of the galactic systems .",
