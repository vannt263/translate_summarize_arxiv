    "the first step toward planet formation is thought to be the growth of dust grains in protoplanetary disks surrounding young stellar objects .",
    "models suggest that by the t tauri stage of evolution ( @xmath0 1 myr ) , significant grain growth should have already occurred , with the presence of large bodies expected ( e.g. , beckwith , henning & nakagawa 2000 ) .",
    "observationally , this has been hard to prove conclusively .",
    "although tentative evidence for grain growth was first suggested in measurements of the thermal emission from these young disks at millimeter wavelengths , grain growth is only one of a handful of possible explanations for the observed flattening of the wavelength dependence of opacity ( e.g. , beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . in principle",
    ", the effect of grain growth should be more marked in long wavelength scattered light than in thermal emission , since scattered light is most sensitive to grain sizes on order of the wavelength of observation .",
    "the longest wavelength , however , at which resolved scattered light from t tauri disks has been detected is 2.2 ( e.g. , cotera et al .",
    "2001 ; mccabe , duchne & ghez 2002 ) , which only effectively probes grain sizes up to the maximum grain size expected in most model ism distributions ( @xmath0 1 ; kim , martin & hendry 1994 ) .",
    "these experiments , therefore , have not yet been tremendously sensitive to grain growth . at mid - infrared wavelengths , scattered light experiments probe grain sizes roughly an order of magnitude larger than the standard ism cut - off , as has been successfully demonstrated in observations of a more evolved post - main - sequence nebula ( tuthill et al .",
    "such experiments applied to the pre - main - sequence stage of evolution potentially offer a powerful way to probe the initial stages of grain growth .",
    "the hk  tau binary system is an ideal candidate for the detection of scattered light at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "while the primary , hktau a , has yet to be spatially resolved at any wavelength , the secondary , hk  tau b , is detected as an extended nebula at optical ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) , near - infrared ( stapelfeldt et al . 1998 ; koresko 1998 ) , and millimeter wavelengths ( duchne et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the near - infrared and optical scattered light images are best modelled as light being scattered off the flared outer edges of the upper and lower surfaces of a nearly edge - on , optically thick disk , whereas the millimeter observations probe the dust thermal emission . while there are no existing reports of the detection of spatially resolved mid - infrared scattered light from any protoplanetary disk or debris disk , the advent of 10 meter class telescopes should permit such a detection for hk  tau b. the disk is large ( @xmath015 , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) compared to the mid - infrared diffraction limit of a 10  m telescope ( @xmath002 at 10 ) , and the measured lower limit to the line of sight extinction within the disk ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests that it is optically thick at mid - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath1 , using the ism extinction law of rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) . as such",
    ", any competing thermal emission arising in the hot inner disk region is removed from the line of sight .",
    "an additional advantage of the hk  tau system is that hk  tau a , located only 24 away from hk  tau b , provides an instantaneous measurement of the point spread function and an astrometric reference point .",
    "models of the dust properties of the hk  tau b disk in both the scattering and thermal regime have led to contradictory results ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ; dalessio et al . 2001",
    "; duchne et al .",
    "2003 ) , with evidence for and against the presence of grain growth . while the optical and near - infrared scattered light images are consistent with standard ism dust size distributions , dalessio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , using sed fitting constrained by the outer radius of the disk , suggest a grain size distribution that extends up to at least 1 mm . however , duchne et al . ( 2003 ) , in resolving the 1.3 millimeter flux between the two components of the system , limit the maximum grain size to 200 , ruling out the presence of millimeter sized particles as predicted by dalessio et al . furthermore , duchne et al .",
    "find that the thermal millimeter and optical scattered light results are hard to reconcile with a single population of dust grains , leading them to suggest that hk  tau b has a layered disk structure , with the surface layer showing no evidence for 13 sized grains , assuming a power law size distribution .",
    "this latter conclusion can be readily tested ; scattered light images at @xmath010 are by far the most direct probe of the presence of supra - micron sized grains in the surface layer of the disk .    in this paper",
    ", we report observations of hk  tau using the keck 10  m telescope which resolve the disk at 11.8 .",
    "the observations and data reduction are outlined in  2 and the resulting disk and binary parameters are investigated in  3 .",
    "we argue that the observed mid - infrared flux is actually scattered light , and , comparing the observations to monte carlo scattering simulations , place constraints on the size distribution in  4 .",
    "on 2002 november 13 ( ut ) , observations of hk  tau ( @xmath2 , b1950 ) were made on the w.m .",
    "keck i telescope with the long wavelength spectrometer ( _ lws _ , jones & puetter 1993 ) in imaging mode through the sic filter ( @xmath3 = 11.78 , @xmath4 = 2.34 ) .",
    "hk  tau was observed in the standard chop - nod mode , with the chopper running at a frequency of 5 hz and an amplitude of 10 , which moved the object out of the field of view in the chop beam .",
    "we chopped along a position angle of 60@xmath5 , which was chosen to avoid chopping along either the binary position angle or the edge - on disk axis .",
    "the chop - nod cycle was repeated 13 times , resulting in a total on - source integration time of 312 seconds .",
    "the photometric standard @xmath6 ari was observed regularly throughout the night , establishing that atmospheric conditions were photometric .",
    "each chop - nod cycle is combined using the standard ` double difference ' technique designed to remove the sky and telescope thermal signatures from the data .",
    "the final image is the median of 12 of the double differences , shifted using hk  tau a , which is clearly detected in each frame , as a reference point .",
    "one frame suffered from chop smearing and was therefore not included in the analysis .",
    "a similar procedure is used to analyze @xmath6 ari and 6 known binary systems in taurus observed as part of a separate study ( mccabe et al . in preparation ) ; the binary stars provide estimates of the _ lws _ plate scale and orientation , measured to be 0081 @xmath7 0002 and -36 @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the resulting point spread function of these observations are nearly diffraction limited ( fwhm @xmath9 029 ) .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration for the new sic filter is established using calibrated stellar spectra of @xmath6 ari and @xmath6 lyr , which were observed along with @xmath6 ari on the previous night ( cohen et al .",
    "1992 ; cohen et al .",
    "the total flux density expected from these two observed standards is modelled by integrating the calibrated spectra through the transmission profiles of the filter , the model atmosphere above mauna kea assuming 1.5 airmasses and 1.6 mm of precipitable water ( lord 1992 ) , and the quantum efficiency of the _ lws _ detector .",
    "the modelled flux densities for @xmath6 lyr and @xmath6 ari are 28.3 jy and 58.6 jy respectively .",
    "the difference between the modelled and observed flux density ratio between these two stars is 6% , which we use as an estimate of the uncertainty in this calibration process .",
    "figure 1 shows the final 11.8 image , in which two sources are detected with a signal to noise ratio of 63 and 8 respectively .",
    "photometry is carried out on both components using a 049 radius circular aperture , resulting in a flux density ratio of 30 @xmath7 4 and an absolute flux density of 208 @xmath7 13 mjy and 6.9 @xmath7 1.0 mjy for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "a @xmath10 fit of a 2 dimensional gaussian to each component , using the _ n2gaussfit _ task in iraf , is done to provide relative astrometry .",
    "separated by 2228 @xmath7 0056 at a position angle of 170.3@xmath7 1.2 , the two sources have relative positions in the mid - infrared that are consistent with those of hk  tau a and b at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , leinert et al . 1993 ; simon et al .",
    "1995 ) ; we therefore conclude that we are detecting mid - infrared emission from both components of the hk  tau binary system .",
    "the most striking aspect of figure 1 is that the secondary , hk  tau b , is spatially extended .",
    "the best @xmath10 gaussian fit ( @xmath11=0.91 over 0.65 square arcseconds ) finds a fwhm of 050 @xmath7 005 aligned along a position angle of 51@xmath7 6 . using the position of hk  tau a , along with the relative plate scale and orientation of the cameras , the mid - infrared image of hk  tau",
    "is aligned with the optical wfpc2 image ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) in the zoomed - in panel in figure 1 .",
    "the uncertainty in each direction is 0047 ; the wfpc2 platescale and orientation uncertainties are negligible compared to those of _ lws _",
    "( holtzman et al . 1995 ) , therefore the positional uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the _ lws _ platescale and orientation measurements .",
    "comparison with the wfpc2 observations show that the extended mid - infrared emission is aligned along the same position angle of the scattered light disk seen in the visible ( 51@xmath7 6 vs. 40 ) and is coincident with the northwest nebula to within 003 ( 0.6@xmath12 ) in the direction perpendicular to the disk .",
    "in contrast , the offset between the disk midplane , represented by the center of the dark lane in the wfpc2 images , and the extended mid - infrared flux is significant ( 0146 ; 3.1@xmath12 ) .",
    "the 11.8 flux appears to be slightly shifted from the peak of the visible scattered light disk ( see figure 1 ) . comparing the disk centers from the gaussian fitting we find an offset of 0105 ( 2.2@xmath12 ) along the disk axis .",
    "deeper observations of this system are needed to determine whether this asymmetry is real .",
    "the presence of an asymmetry would not be all that unexpected ; a number of protoplanetary disks show evidence for some level of scattered light asymmetry .",
    "for example , both gg tau ( silber et al .",
    "2000 ; mccabe , duchene & ghez 2002 ) and hh 30 ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "1996 ) show structure , and hk  tau b itself shows evidence for a non - symmetric scattered light morphology in the southeastern nebula ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "the nature of hk  tau b s mid - infrared flux can be established on the basis of the observed morphology . by far the majority of mid - infrared photons from a typical t tauri star+disk system ( e.g. , @xmath1390% in the models of lachaume et al .",
    "2003 , and private communication ) are emitted thermally from the central 1 au region of the disk ( 1au = 7mas at a distance of 139 pc to taurus ; bertout , robichon & arenou 1999 ) .",
    "the observed mid - infrared morphology of this edge - on disk therefore depends primarily on the optical depth along the line of sight through the disk .",
    "if the disk is optically thin , the observer will see an unresolved point source positioned close to the midplane of the disk .",
    "however , if the disk is optically thick , the mid - infrared emission from this region will be totally absorbed , allowing the detection of scattered light from the flared outer edges of the upper and lower surfaces of the disk , a case which applies to the optical and near - infrared images of hk  tau b.10k ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ; dalessio et al .",
    "] in this scenario , the mid - infrared flux will be aligned with the scattered light nebulae seen in the optical and near - infrared and may possibly be spatially resolved , depending on the scattering properties of the dust .",
    "the observed mid - infrared flux is coincident with the northwest nebula , instead of the disk midplane and is also extended along the same position angle (  3 ) .",
    "this indicates that the observed mid - infrared flux is produced by thermally emitted photons originating from the inner disk region being scattered off the flared outer edge of the disk .",
    "the morphology of the scattered light from the disk is expected to be highly dependent on the properties of the dust population present in the disk .",
    "typical ism dust models produce highly isotropic scattering in the mid - infrared regime ( see , for example , figures 1 and 2 of wolfire & churchwell 1994 ) . as such , to first order one would expect the entire length of each nebula to be seen in scattered light . alternatively ,",
    "if the disk contains large grains ( @xmath14 ) , which are highly forward - throwing , we would see an almost unresolved point - like source in the center of the northwest nebula .",
    "the observed scattered light disk morphology is between these two extremes , being clearly resolved but not illuminated across its full extent .",
    "this suggests that scattering at 11.8 , while not as forward - throwing as that seen in the visible , is not as isotropic as that expected from ism dust grains either .",
    "we performed monte carlo scattering simulations of the disk in order to confirm this qualitative behaviour and to place quantitative limits on the size of grains responsible for the scattered light .",
    "the simulations , which are similar to those used in mccabe , duchne & ghez ( 2002 ) , employ mathis & whiffen ( 1989 ) dust properties in an @xmath15 power law grain size distribution .",
    "we fix @xmath16 , the minimum grain size in the distribution , to be 0.1 and vary the maximum grain size to see how sensitive the scattered light distribution is to the presence of large grains . while @xmath16 is larger than normally used in a standard ism grain size distribution , because we are working in the mid - infrared the scattering properties are not at all sensitive to smaller grains , and therefore the simulations are unaffected by this choice . the best fitting disk model for hk  tau b from stapelfeldt et al . ( 1998 ) is used to define the geometry of the disk .",
    "the simulations confirm that the scattered light distribution along the northwest nebula , through the value of the dust asymmetry parameter , @xmath17 , is very sensitive to the upper limit of the grain size distribution .",
    "as expected , models with exclusively sub - micron sized grains yield nebulae with fwhm greater than 1 , while models with a@xmath18 5 result in an almost unresolved point - like source in the center of the northwest nebula . models sampling a wide range of @xmath17 values show that the 11.8 data are fairly well represented by models with @xmath19 .",
    "we have assumed here that the disk is symmetric about the minor axis .",
    "the effect of the possible asymmetry can be qualitatively estimated by taking the hwhm along each half of the disk axis from the center of the disk and doubling it to find the potential range in fwhm .",
    "we find a range of fwhm of 0307 , which increases the range of best fit @xmath17 values to 0.150.83 .    for a single size dust population , @xmath17 values of 0.40.55 at 11.8",
    "correspond to grain sizes in the range 2.53.2 , implying that grains in this size range must exist in the surface of the hktau b disk .",
    "including the possibility of a disk asymmetry ( with @xmath17 ranging from 0.150.83 ) reduces the minimum grain size from 2.5 to @xmath01.5 .",
    "this does not suggest that the mean grain size is this large , but that the 11.8 scattering cross - section - weighted mean size is . only a very small amount of such large grains is needed to achieve this , but these results show that grains of this size must be present in the disk .",
    "these grains are significantly larger than those expected in the ism , implying that grain growth has occurred in the upper surface of this disk . such large grains are not excluded from extinction fits to dense cloud regions ( e.g. , @xmath20 4 , weingartner & draine 2001 ) , therefore it remains an open question as to whether the large grains are a result of dust evolution within the disk or were already present in the dense cloud from which this system formed .    it should be noted that a single ism - like power law size distribution extending to @xmath02 produces @xmath17 values in the optical that are significantly higher than the best - fit @xmath17 found by stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , a model contradiction that has been pointed out by duchne et al .",
    "one potential way to reconcile the various wavelength constraints is a more complex size distribution , such as a power law with a gradual fall - off .",
    "such a modified size distribution has already been suggested for ism grains ( e.g. , kim , martin & hendry 1994 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) . the results from observations of this disk at multiple wavelengths also clearly show that analysis of dust scattering from a single wavelength can provide misleading results",
    ". a more thorough characterization of the grain properties and disk geometry will require simultaneous modelling of deep images over as wide a range of wavelengths as possible .",
    "this study , however , unambiguously shows the need for 13 grains to be included in any dust model of this system . + the authors thank randy campbell and ron quick at the keck observatory for their help in obtaining these observations and karl stapelfeldt and eric becklin for stimulating discussions .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee whose excellent comments have added to this work .",
    "support for this work was provided by the packard foundation .",
    "the authors also wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
