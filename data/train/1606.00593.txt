    "the network science approach to complexity has been traditionally based in a static view of complex systems @xcite .",
    "the increasing availability of time - resolved data on different kind of interactions has unveiled an additional level of complexity in networked systems , consisting in topological patterns of connections that evolve with time @xcite .",
    "this transformation has been particularly relevant in the field of social sciences @xcite , since social interactions are intrinsically dynamic , being constantly created and terminated at different time scales .",
    "moreover , digital traces of human dynamics are nowadays ubiquitous , from mobile phone communications @xcite to face - to - face social interactions @xcite , providing inestimable longitudinal data , including timing of social interactions , at a scale unprecedented in other kinds of systems .",
    "the emerging field of temporal networks @xcite , developed to yield the theoretical grounding needed to represent and analyze the properties of such time - varying complex systems , is thus influenced by a bias towards social dynamics .    from the study of large scale data , a wealth of rich patterns and characteristic properties",
    "have been uncovered in human dynamics .",
    "one of the most striking features observed is probably the bursty nature of social interactions @xcite , revealed by the observation of inter - event times @xmath0 between two consecutive interactions of the same individual following heavy tailed distributions that can approximated as power laws of the form @xmath1 , with @xmath2 in general , at strong odds with previously assumed poissonian behavior .",
    "such bursty behavior has been observed in many instances of social interactions @xcite as well as in phenomena belonging to other fields , such as earthquakes @xcite , neuronal activity @xcite , mrna synthesis in cells @xcite , etc .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive reference list ) .",
    "moreover , it has been recognized that the bursty nature of temporal networks can have a deep impact on dynamical processes running on top of such time - varying systems @xcite .",
    "these observations claim for a better theoretical understanding of the dynamics of such temporal networks , and in particular for the design of simplified , descriptive or generative temporal network models .",
    "several models of temporal networks have been put forward in the literature @xcite , focused on different possible mechanisms to explain the empirically observed properties . among those , it is noteworthy the recently proposed non - poissoinan activity driven ( nopad ) model @xcite .",
    "the nopad model aims to be a generative model , akin to the configuration model for static networks @xcite .",
    "it is defined in terms of agents that follow independent renewal processes @xcite , starting social connections separated by intervals of time @xmath0 distributed according to some prescribed waiting time distribution @xmath3 , establishing connections to randomly chosen other agents .",
    "the model thus captures the most basic feature of social temporal networks , namely a non poissonian inter - event time distribution , which can be adjusted by imposing long tailed waiting time distributions @xmath3 , in a simple , mathematically tractable framework , the one of renewal theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed mathematical analysis of the nopad model , focusing in the properties of the static networks that can be constructed integrating the contacts in the temporal dynamics .",
    "indeed , within the mathematical framework of temporal network , a static representation can be recovered by integrating a time - varying graph in a time interval @xmath4 $ ] , spanning a width @xmath5 , and starting after a time @xmath6 from the inception of the network .",
    "the study of this integrated network is relevant , since traditional static social networks @xcite are constructed in this way , and it is important to know how the features of the temporal dynamics affects the topological properties of its integrated counterpart .",
    "the inclusion of non - poissoinian dynamics in the process of links addition , given by the waiting time @xmath3 with a non - exponential form , has a deep impact on the topology of the resulting time - aggregated network .",
    "a relevant signature of this effect is the aging behavior @xcite of its topological properties , which depends not only on the width of the integration time @xmath5 @xcite , but also on the _ aging time _",
    "@xmath6 at which the integration starts .",
    "the nopad model can thus be viewed as a null model , able to single out aging exclusively due to the burstiness of links activation , different from aging of different nature that might be present in real social networks , such as physical aging @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : non - poiss - activ ] we define the nopad model as a natural extension of the previously proposed activity driven model @xcite .",
    "[ sec : topol - prop - integr ] sets up the mapping of the nopad model to a hidden variables network @xcite , which will allow for the calculation of the topological properties of the integrated network .",
    "[ sec : degree - distribution ] is devoted to the general calculation of the integrated degree distribution .",
    "the case of waiting time distributions with a power - law form in the absence of aging , i.e. with @xmath7 , is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : non - aged - networks ] ; the more interesting case of aging effects is analyzed in sec .",

    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper , discussing the results presented and drawing future perspectives .",
    "the activity - driven ( ad ) model @xcite is built upon the empirical observation that individuals are characterized by different levels of _ social activity _ , i.e. they have different levels of propensity to become engaged in social interactions .",
    "social activity , which can be defined as the probability per unit time @xmath9 that an individual becomes active and starts a social interaction , has been empirically measured in a variety of social temporal networks , and shown to exhibit a heterogeneous , heavy tailed distribution @xcite . to take into account this heterogeneity , in the ad model @xcite each node @xmath10 , representing an agent , is endowed with a _ constant _ activity @xmath11 , representing the probability that at each time step he / she will establish a link , of infinitesimally short duration , with another agent , chosen uniformly at random .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that the degree distribution @xmath12 of the resulting network integrated up to time @xmath5 is functionally related to the probability distribution @xmath13 from which the activities @xmath11 are drawn .",
    "therefore , if fed with the empirically observed @xmath13 , the time - integrated ad networks show some of the topological properties of real social networks , and in particular its characteristic heavy tailed degree distribution @xcite . the ad model has proved to be very flexible , allowing to incorporate many typical features of human dynamics , such as memory effects @xcite , and it is analytically suitable to study dynamical processes on time - varying networks , such as epidemic spreading @xcite",
    ", random walks @xcite , or percolation @xcite .",
    "however , it is easy to see that for sufficiently large @xmath14 , in the continuous time limit , a constant activity @xmath11 leads to an inter - event time distribution for node @xmath10 with the form @xmath15 @xcite , following an exponential form .",
    "thus the ad model fails to reproduce the main feature observed in real temporal networks , namely a long tailed inter - event time distribution between social contacts .",
    "one way to overcome this drawback is to allow for each node @xmath10 a time - dependent activity @xmath16 , where @xmath0 is the time elapsed since the last activation of node @xmath10 . with this assumption",
    ", one can define a generalized model in which each individual @xmath10 becomes active by following a renewal process @xcite , defined by a _ waiting time _ distribution between successive activation events given by @xmath17 @xcite . for the standard ad model , with @xmath11 constant",
    ", we have @xmath18 , that is , agents follow a simple poisson process @xcite .",
    "any function @xmath16 leads thus to the consideration of a generalized _ non - poissonan activity driven _ ( nopad ) model @xcite .",
    "shifting away from the instantaneous activity @xmath16 , the nopad model can be defined in terms of a set of agents that become active by following a renewal process with waiting time distribution @xmath19 , giving the probability of observing a time @xmath0 between two activation events of agent @xmath10 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume here the same functional form of @xmath20 for all agents , @xmath21 , where the parameter @xmath22 gauges the heterogeneity of the activation rate of the agents , and it is randomly drawn form a distribution @xmath23 .    here",

    "each time an agent @xmath10 is active , an individual @xmath35 is chosen uniformly at random and an edge is created between @xmath10 and @xmath36 . in the case of a pre - existing link ,",
    "no additional edge is created ( a weight increment may possibly be considered ) .    in order to construct the aged network , i.e. aggregated over the time interval @xmath37",
    "$ ] , we apply the generating process between @xmath38 and @xmath39 and discard all the events occurring before @xmath6 .",
    "the topological properties of the integrated networks generated by the nopad model can be worked out by applying a mapping to the class of network models with hidden variables , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . hidden",
    "variables network models are defined as follows : starting from a set of @xmath14 initially disconnected nodes , each node @xmath10 has assigned a variable @xmath40 , drawn at random from a probability distribution @xmath41 .",
    "each pair of nodes @xmath10 and @xmath36 , with hidden variables @xmath40 and @xmath42 , are connected with an undirected edge with probability @xmath43 ( the connection probability ) .",
    "the model is fully defined by the functions @xmath41 and @xmath44 , and all the topological properties of the resulting network can be derived through the propagator @xmath45 @xcite , defined as the conditional probability that a vertex with hidden variable @xmath46 ends up connected to exactly @xmath47 other vertices ( has degree @xmath47 ) . from this propagator , expressions for the topological properties of the model",
    "can be readily obtained @xcite .",
    "we can apply the hidden variables formalism to the nopad model defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : non - poiss - activ ] by identifying the mapping to the corresponding hidden variables and connection probability .",
    "let us assume that all agents are disconnected and synchronized at time @xmath48 , and let us consider an integration time window @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "from the definition of the model , the parameter that determines the connectivity of a node @xmath10 is the number of times @xmath33 that it has become active in the considered time window ( its activation number ) .",
    "this number depends on its turn of the parameter @xmath50 characterizing the waiting time distribution of node @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we choose as hidden variables @xmath51 it is worth noticing that these quantities are not independent , and it is convenient to describe the variable @xmath52 with its conditional distribution @xmath53 , which can be computed in terms of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the hidden variable probability distribution thus reads @xmath55 finally , it is easy to see that the connection probability only depends on the activation numbers @xmath33 , @xmath56 depending only implicitly on the integration window through the distribution of the activation numbers @xmath53 .",
    "simple probabilistic arguments show that the probability that two nodes with activation numbers @xmath52 and @xmath57 become eventually connected in the integrated network is @xmath58^{r + r'}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath59 , we have @xmath60    given the form of the connection probability , the corresponding propagator will be a function of the activation number alone , @xmath61 . to find its functional form , one notices that a node with activation number @xmath52 will have a degree @xmath47 equal to the sum of an in - degree and and out - degree , @xmath62 , which accounts for the edges created by the activation of the node , and by the activation of all other nodes , respectively . in the limit @xmath59 , @xmath63 ( each activation event leads to an edge connecting to a different node ) and",
    "thus the propagator of the out - degree is a delta function centered at @xmath52 , @xmath64 . for the in - degree we can write @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of connections received from other nodes with hidden variable @xmath57 . by following",

    "finally , we obtain the total propagator as the convolution of the in - degree and the out - degree propagators , having the form @xmath74 in the limit @xmath75 , the previous exact expression can be approximated by the simple shifted poissonian form @xmath76 which we will use in the rest of the manuscript to allow for mathematical tractability .",
