    "almost 25 years after the discovery of the @xmath3 quark in proton nucleus collisions  @xcite , the accurate understanding of how @xmath3 quarks are being produced in hadronic environments is still an open issue .",
    "the subject of beauty production has recently received renewed interest , with the advent of new measurements at the @xmath4 collider hera , and elsewhere .",
    "the dominant mechanism for the production of heavy quarks at hera is photon gluon fusion : a photon coupling to the scattered electron interacts with a gluon from the proton by forming a quark antiquark pair , e.g.  @xmath5 .",
    "a quantitative description of the process requires the knowledge of the gluon momentum distribution in the proton , the calculation of the hard photon gluon subprocess , and a fragmentation function which accounts for the long - range effects binding the heavy quark in a hadron . the gluon density in the relevant range of momentum fraction @xmath6 and at the appropriate scales",
    "is known to an accuracy of a few percent from the analysis of scaling violations of the proton structure function @xmath7 measured at hera  @xcite .",
    "the partonic process has been calculated in qcd , at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the masses of the charm , and even more so of the beauty quark ensure that at least one hard scale is present that renders qcd perturbation theory to be applicable .",
    "the fragmentation function is extracted from @xmath0 annihilation data , where the kinematics of the hard process is well determined by a clean initial state .",
    "new results on @xmath3 fragmentation , with significantly improved precision , have appeared recently  @xcite and are included in this review . with such precise ingredients , @xmath3 production at hera",
    "provides a qcd testing ground _",
    "par excellence_. the validity range of the perturbative methods and the universality of non - perturbative phenomenological inputs can be closely examined .",
    "understanding heavy quark production is furthermore essential for the proton structure analysis of inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data  @xcite in terms of parton distribution functions , since final states with charm account for about a quarter of the inclusive rate in the kinematic domain probed at hera  @xcite .",
    "as shown in more detail in  @xcite , the qcd picture sketched above has proven very successful in describing the experimental results on charm production in dis  @xcite .",
    "the limit of small photon virtuality is equivalent to charm photoproduction . even in this regime ,",
    "the picture works reasonably well  @xcite , albeit some further clarification is needed with regard to the treatment of resolved photon processes , where the photon flutuates into a hadronic state which interacts with the proton . evidently , it is of particular interest to subject the theory to an independent test with beauty production data .",
    "the nlo qcd calculations of heavy quark production follow two basic approaches ; for a more profound discussion see  @xcite . the cross section for e.g.  photoproduction of heavy hadrons factorizes and can be expressed as convolutions of parton distribution functions for photon and proton , @xmath8 , respectively , the partonic cross section @xmath9 ( @xmath10 denoting the parton type ) , and a non - perturbative fragmentation function @xmath11 , which maps the subsequent transition of the produced heavy quark into an observable heavy hadron , retaining a fraction @xmath12 of the heavy quark s momentum , symbolically @xmath13 in the so - called massive scheme , only light quarks and gluons are active partons in the initial state .",
    "the heavy quark mass @xmath14 sets the scale for the perturbative expansion of @xmath15 which has been evaluated up to @xmath16 , including mass effects .",
    "if a second and different large scale is present , e.g.  at large transverse momentum of the heavy quarks , @xmath17 , these calculations acquire large logarithms of the ratio @xmath18 , and the fixed order result becomes less reliable . in `` resummed '' calculations  @xcite , in the so - called massless",
    "approach , the leading terms of this type are absorbed in scale - dependent fragmentation functions , which obey the altarelli - parisi evolution equations .",
    "different schemes exist for the construction of fragmentation functions .",
    "the heavy quarks are treated in the same way as the light quarks .",
    "they appear in the initial state structure functions for proton and photon and contribute via flavour excitation processes to the production of heavy quark final states .",
    "however , mass effects in the partonic cross section are neglected .",
    "the massive and the massless approach thus have complementary ranges of applicability  low and high @xmath19  which do not necessarily overlap . recently",
    ", `` merged '' calculations interpolating between the schemes have appeared  @xcite . only in the massless scheme",
    ", the factorization theorem guarantees the universality of the fragmentation functions extracted from @xmath0 data . for the scale - independent function @xmath11 in the massive scheme ,",
    "this remains an assumption based on less rigorous arguments .",
    "the hera results for beauty are so far limited by small statistics and dominated by production near threshold .",
    "the calculations supposed to be appropriate in this regime follow the fixed order ` massive ' approach and are available in the form of monte carlo integration programs for photoproduction  @xcite and dis  @xcite . due to the higher quark mass ,",
    "the qcd predictions are expected to be more reliable for beauty than for charm .",
    "however , we note that the nlo corrections to the predicted hera cross section are around 40% of the lo result in both cases .    in the next section",
    "the measurements performed at hera will be presented in detail and confronted with theoretical expectations . in a subsequent section",
    ", results from other production environments will be summarized .",
    "@xmath0 data on fragmentation and measurements of beauty production cross sections in @xmath2 and @xmath1 collisions will be presented and compared with qcd calculations which follow the same principles as for @xmath4 collisions . in the last part",
    ", we will come back to hera and discuss the potential offered by the hera upgrade programme  @xcite for further studies in the field .",
    "beauty production at hera is suppressed by two orders of magnitude with respect to charm , due to the larger mass and smaller electric charge of the @xmath3 quark .",
    "the total cross section is dominated by photoproduction .",
    "final states are characterized by a steeply falling @xmath19 spectrum , which represents a challenge for secondary vertex detection . with @xmath20 , the minimally required momentum fractions of the initial state gluon",
    "is about @xmath21 times higher than for charm production ; typical values of @xmath6 are around @xmath22 and extend up to a few times @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding boosts relative to the laboratory frame are such that most @xmath3 quarks produced at hera are emitted under central rapidities into detector regions well covered by existing  @xcite or to be commissioned  @xcite silicon tracking devices .",
    "all hera measurements of @xmath3 production so far rely on inclusive semi - leptonic decays , using identified muons or electrons in dijet events . a beauty candidate with a distinctive two - jet structure and the clean signature of a penetrating muon track",

    "the high mass gives rise to large values of the transverse momentum @xmath27 of the decay lepton relative to the direction of an associated jet ( see figure  [ fig : event - ptrel ] ) .",
    "both collaborations have published photoproduction results  @xcite using this method .",
    "more recently , with the precision offered by the h1 vertex detector  @xcite it has become possible to observe tracks from secondary @xmath3 vertices and to exploit the long lifetime as a @xmath3 tag .",
    "the zeus analysis has been discussed in its preliminary version at the previous ringberg workshop  @xcite and has meanwhile been published  @xcite .",
    "it uses electrons which are identified in the zeus detector by means of the topology of calorimetric energy deposition and of the specific energy loss @xmath28 measured in the central track detector .",
    "background from hadrons misidentified as electrons is statistically subtracted .",
    "non - prompt electrons , mostly from photon conversions , are identified on the basis of track topology and invariant mass criteria . from a sample of @xmath29 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38.5  pb@xmath30 , a signal of @xmath31 electrons attributed to heavy quark decays is extracted . performing the procedure in bins of @xmath27 and correcting for efficiency ,",

    "the normalization is adjusted to that of the data , and the shape is fitted by varying the relative contributions of charm and beauty .",
    "the fit yields a beauty fraction of @xmath32 in the sample , close to the herwig expectation of 16  % .",
    "this is translated into a cross section for the visible kinematic range , @xmath33 the range is defined by the requirements on the photon virtuality , @xmath34 gev@xmath35 , the inelasticity variable @xmath36 , the jet rapidity @xmath37 , the transverse jet energy @xmath38 gev for the ( second ) most energetic jet , the transverse momentum @xmath39  gev and rapidity @xmath40 of the electron .    in a similar manner",
    ", the cross section has also been measured as a function of @xmath41 , an observable which is calculated from the energies and rapidities of the jets and which in the leading - order picture corresponds to the momentum fraction of the parton in the resolved photon entering the hard process .",
    "( for direct interactions of the photon @xmath42 . )",
    "the @xmath43 spectrum allows a resolved contribution of @xmath44 to be estimated in this picture .",
    "the herwig expectation is 35 % , which in this program is mostly due to flavour excitation in the photon . due to the small beauty component in the sample",
    ", this does not allow conclusions on the @xmath3 production dynamics to be drawn , but it corroborates earlier observations on charm , made by zeus with @xmath45 mesons in dijet events  @xcite .",
    "the visible cross section can directly be compared with leading order monte carlo predictions , which are 8  pb for herwig  @xcite and 18  pb for pythia  @xcite ( also including flavour excitation ) .",
    "the recently developed cascade program  @xcite , based on unintegrated parton distributions and the ccfm evolution equation  @xcite , follows a different approach to account for higher order qcd effects .",
    "as shown in a separate contribution to this workshop  @xcite , the approach is able to reproduce results on @xmath3 production at the tevatron .",
    "the cascade prediction for hera in the zeus kinematic range is 18 pb  @xcite .    in order to compare the measured cross sections with qcd predictions ,",
    "the monte carlo simulation is used to convert the result into a @xmath3 quark cross section for a range restricted in terms of parton kinematic variables to @xmath46 gev , @xmath47 and to the same @xmath48 and @xmath49 range as above .",
    "the result , @xmath50 with the third error indicating the model dependence of the extrapolation , is shown in figure  [ fig : zeusresult ] together with the nlo qcd expectation in the massive approach , which is obtained with the fmnr program  @xcite and drawn as a function of the minimal @xmath51 requirement .",
    "the theoretical curve lies below the measurement .",
    "the first observation of @xmath3 production at hera by h1  @xcite was based on the @xmath27 method , too , and has also been presented at the previous workshop of this series  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the more recent work based on the lifetime signature , which improves the photoproduction result  @xcite and provides a first measurement in dis  @xcite .    the h1 central silicon tracker ( cst )  @xcite consists of two cylindrical layers of silicon strip detectors , surrounding the beam pipe at radii of @xmath52  mm and @xmath53  mm , respectively , from the beam axis . with an effective length of 358  mm",
    "it covers a large part of the @xmath4 interaction region and has a polar angle acceptance of @xmath54 for the outer layer , for particles emanating from the nominal interaction point .",
    "double sided silicon detectors with readout strip pitches of 50 @xmath24 m and 88 @xmath24 m provide resolutions of 12 @xmath24 m in @xmath55 and 25 @xmath24 m in @xmath12 .",

    "the achieved resolution of the transverse distance @xmath56 to the center of the h1 detector can be parameterized as @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the first term represents the intrinsic resolution and the second the contribution from multiple scattering in the beam pipe .    a magnified view of the vertex region of the event of figure  [ fig : event - ptrel ] is displayed in figure  [ fig : vertex - delta ] .",

    "the seen numbers of events correspond to 25  pb ( h1 ) and 4  pb ( zeus ) .",
    "this difference is partially due to different jet energy and @xmath49 ranges and to the fact that zeus uses only @xmath88 , but h1 muons of both signs and in addition includes a contribution of about 15% of secondary muons .",

    "resolved contributions involving the partonic structure of the photon are expected to be suppressed  @xcite , the dis case is therefore complementary and theoretically cleaner .",
    "the theoretical understanding of @xmath3 production data must always revert to a description of the fragmentation process , since only hadrons can be observed experimentally .",
    "since the formation of hadrons involves non - perturbative effects of long - range binding forces , it can not be calculated from first principles . yet",

    "the experimental precision can be expected to improve even further , when results from the upgraded tevatron become available , and this should provide additional guidelines to find out which strategy most effectively includes the missing higher oder contributions . in either case , whether speculations on supersymmetry will further be nourished , or whether `` only '' the qcd techniques will be refined , complementary information from hera will be extremely valuable .",
    "apart from @xmath0 annihilation , dis represents the cleanest @xmath3 production environment .",
    "the hera collider is currently resuming its operation , after an upgrade which lays the foundations for an integrated luminosity of 1  fb@xmath30 to be accumulated in the next 5  years .",
    "much of the experimental upgrade program which was pursued in parallel by the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations is directed towards augmenting the capabilities for heavy quark physics , notably by improving the acceptance and precision of the tracking systems , in particular for forward - going particles , and by enhancing the trigger sensitivity for final states with small @xmath19 .",
    "the hera results on beauty production are statistically limited , and it is evident that higher luminosity would be beneficial . here",
    "we ask more specifically the question whether it will be possible to vary the two scales @xmath100 and @xmath48 independently and over a range extending significantly beyond the one set by the quark mass , @xmath101 .",
    "this would open kinematic regions to investigate the regime most relevant for improving the perturbative qcd calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig : heratwo ] shows the estimated number of beauty candidates to be expected if the h1 muon analysis described in section 2 would be extended in its present form to the full anticipated hera ii statistics .",
    "the event yield is displayed as a function of the transverse momentum of the @xmath3 quark in the hadronic centre - of - mass system .",
    "reasonable results can be obtained with samples of about 100  events .",
    "thus , in photoproduction ( dis ) measurements up to @xmath102  gev will be possible . in the high @xmath48 regime",
    ", more inclusive techniques will be needed to extend the range beyond @xmath103  gev . with the correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath48 at hera in mind",
    ", one can foresee meaningful tests of low @xmath6 or high @xmath19 resummation approaches .",
    "zeus is presently being equipped with a micro - vertex detector  @xcite , while first results obtained with the h1 silicon tracker have been described here .",
    "a major goal is to apply inclusive secondary vertex tagging methods with algorithms similar to those used at the tevatron or at lep , where they provided very pure @xmath3 samples with efficiencies of 20  % and higher .",
    "impact parameter resolutions at hera are similar , and the luminosity upgrade by means of stronger beam focusing has the appreciated side effect of reducing the size of the interaction region to @xmath104 , to be compared with @xmath105 , e.g.   at lep .",
    "it is difficult to seriously predict @xmath3 tagging efficiencies for hera , because they depend crucially on how effectively charm and light quark background can be suppressed ; excellent control of tracking systematics is a key issue here .",
    "the method will work the better , the higher @xmath19 and thus the vertexing accuracy is .",
    "it can complement the more exclusive channels in the region where they suffer most from limited statistics .",
    "it will be interesting to check at hera whether the better description of @xmath3 jet data found in @xmath2 interactions ( figure  [ fig : ppxsect ] ) is a general feature .",
    "extending the measurements , on the other hand , towards low @xmath19 holds the promise of reducing the model uncertainties related to the extrapolations into the region where the cross section is largest .",
    "this could be achieved by replacing the semi - leptonic signature relying on jets by ( semi-)exclusive decay modes involving reconstructed @xmath45 or @xmath106 mesons . due to the higher background levels at lower @xmath19 ,",
    "enhanced discrimination power is required online to fully benefit from the higher luminosity .",
    "h1 is installing new systems  @xcite using latest generation electronics , which will allow to detect invariant mass signatures at the trigger level .",
    "zeus plans to incorporate the vertex detector into the trigger .",
    "finally , both experiments are upgrading their forward tracking systems with new drift chambers and silicon detectors  @xcite .",
    "this will increase the lever arm in @xmath6 ( and @xmath48 ) for qcd studies , probe the gluon distribution in a different region , up to @xmath107 , and give better access to the region where resolved photon processes are important .",
    "moreover , since at hera the production of heavy particles , due to necessarily large @xmath6 values involved , leads to final states boosted into the forward direction , these upgrades will open possibilities to use beautiful signatures in searches for new physics , for example the anomalous production of single top quarks , for which candidates exist  @xcite , but not with a @xmath3 tag .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers for composing a stimulating meeting , as unique and irreplaceable as its venue .",
