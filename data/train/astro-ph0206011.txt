    "accretion onto black holes has been considered as an efficient way to transform gravitational energy into radiation @xcite , and is often thought to occur in the form of a disk , due to the angular momentum of the accreting matter .",
    "this almost certainly is the case in a variety of astrophysical systems , ranging from agns with very massive black holes to stellar mass binaries , analogous to the x  ray binaries known to contain neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the flows in these disks may exhibit very different morphologies depending on the physical conditions present in the system .",
    "accretion is generally thought to proceed through the transport of angular momentum from the inner to the outer regions of the disk , although the mechanism by which this is accomplished is not entirely clear .",
    "the parametrization introduced by @xcite has allowed much progress to be made , without specifying the physics behind the viscosity responsible for angular momentum transport .",
    "magnetohydrodynamical studies ( analytical and numerical ) appear to indicate that magnetic fields and their associated instabilities in disks can effectively generate a viscosity that would drive their evolution @xcite , with equivalent values for the @xmath1 parameter in the range 0.010.1 @xcite . additionally , it has become clear that hydrodynamic processes can play an important role in the structure and evolution of disks , and that multi  dimensional , time ",
    "dependent computations are necessary to fully understand these effects , particularly since the flows can be quite complicated , often exhibiting strong variability , and composed of combinations of inflows / outflows of varying intensity @xcite .    in this context we are motivated to study accretion disks around black holes hydrodynamically , particularly in what concerns central engines for cosmological gamma ray bursts ( grbs )",
    ". the energetics of grbs ( @xmath8  erg are typically released in a few seconds ) and the variability shown in their lightcurves ( down to millisecond timescales ) argues in favor of a compact source that produces a relativistic outflow , usually referred to as a fireball @xcite .",
    "the complicated light curves can then be understood in terms of internal shocks in the outflow itself , caused by velocity variations in the expanding plasma @xcite .",
    "the durations range from @xmath9  s to about @xmath10  s , with a bimodal distribution of short ( @xmath11  s ) and long bursts ( @xmath12  s ) @xcite .",
    "one possible scenario , at least for the class of short bursts , involves the coalescence of compact binaries containing a black hole ( bh ) and a neutron star ( ns ) , or two neutron stars @xcite .",
    "such systems do exist , like psr1913 + 16 @xcite , and they will coalesce due to angular momentum losses to gravitational radiation , provided that the orbital separation is small enough .",
    "the binary coalescence rates are in rough agreement with the observed grb rate @xcite .",
    "the typical dynamical timescale in such binaries immediately prior to coalescence ( @xmath13  ms ) is much shorter than the observed burst duration , and so it requires that the central engine evolves into a configuration that is stable , while retaining a sufficient amount of energy to power the burst .",
    "the formation of a bh with a debris torus around it is a common ingredient of both these scenarios , whose accretion can provide the release of sufficient gravitational energy @xmath14 erg to power a grb @xcite .",
    "a fireball arises from the large compressional heating and dissipation associated with this accretion , which can provide the driving stress necessary for relativistic expansion @xcite .",
    "possible forms of this outflow are kinetic energy of relativistic particles generated by @xmath15 annihilation or an electromagnetic poynting flux .    in either mechanism ,",
    "the duration of the burst is determined by the viscous timescale of the accreting gas , which is significantly longer than the dynamical timescale , thus accounting naturally for the large difference between the durations of bursts and their fast variability . any instability ( of hydrodynamical or magnetic origin )",
    "would presumably be reflected in the relativistic outflow .",
    "strong magnetic fields anchored in the dense matter surrounding the bh would produce large amplitude variations in the energy release @xcite . a weaker field would extract inadequate power ; on the other hand a neutron torus , with its huge amount of differential rotation , is a natural site for the onset of a dynamo process that winds up the magnetic field to the required intensity @xcite .",
    "an acceptable model requires that the orbiting debris not be dispersed completely on too short a timescale , lasting at least as long as the characteristic duration of the burst .",
    "the tidal disruption of a neutron star by a black hole would redistribute matter and angular momentum very rapidly .",
    "the key issue is then how long a sufficient amount of this matter survives to power a burst .",
    "+ in this paper , we study the evolution of realistic disks resulting from dynamical coalescence calculations ( see below  [ method ] ) , on timescales that are comparable to the durations of short grbs ( i.e. a few tenths of a second ) . recently",
    ", the steady state structure of similar disks has been examined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since we wish to investigate the evolution of the disk and its stability , no steady state assumptions are made regarding its structure .",
    "this allows us to compare the strength of the energy release by @xmath15 annihilation relative to mhd coupling and to investigate their potential as a viable source for grb production .",
    "the hydrodynamics of black hole ",
    "neutron star coalescence has been considered in detail by @xcite and @xcite , using an ideal gas equation of state and varying its stiffness through the adiabatic index @xmath16 .",
    "the simulations explored the effect of different initial binary mass ratios @xmath17 and the spin configuration of the neutron star , with respect to the orbital motion .",
    "the viscosity inside neutron stars is far too small to permit synchronization during the inspiral phase @xcite , so it is reasonable to assume that the neutron star spin is negligible with respect to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the exact equation of state at supra ",
    "nuclear densities is uncertain , but it would appear that the radius is largely independent of the mass @xcite , so that in the polytropic approximation , one would assume @xmath18 .",
    "coalescence calculations with this set of parameters were computed by ( * ? ? ? * herafter l01 ) . in particular",
    ", we will use here the results of runs c50 and c31 in that paper , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ( both runs used an index @xmath18 ) .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics are solved in two dimensions using smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) @xcite .",
    "dimensional dynamical coalescence calculations are only followed for a few tens of milliseconds , at most ( those in l01 spanned 23  ms ) , because of computational limitations .",
    "since we wish to explore the behavior of the accretion structures on timescales that are much longer than the dynamical one , we have assumed azimuthal symmetry in the system , and mapped the output from the 3d calculations to cylindrical @xmath0 coordinates .",
    "this allows us to follow the calculations for a few tenths of a second ( all the runs shown in this paper were terminated at @xmath21  s ) .",
    "we have not assumed reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial ( @xmath22 ) plane .",
    "we use a simple ideal gas equation of state , with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the internal energy per unit mass ) , and the fluid is initially given the azimuthal velocity @xmath25 required for centrifugal equilibrium . the self  gravity of the disk",
    "is neglected , and the black hole produces a newtonian point  mass potential @xmath26 .",
    "accretion is modeled by an absorbing boundary at @xmath27 . in practice ,",
    "only the inner regions of the 3d disk are mapped onto two dimensions to start the calculation ( with @xmath28  km and @xmath29  km ) .",
    "the above simplifications clearly do not correspond to the physical conditions one would encounter in such a disk , but we have chosen to use them as a first approximation to the solution for several reasons . in the first place , the 3d dynamical calculations that gave rise to the disks we now use as initial conditions were fully newtonian ( except for the inclusion of gravitational radiation reaction terms ) , particularly regarding the form of the gravitational potential produced by the black hole .",
    "for consistency we have thus kept this form . in the future",
    "we will explore situations in which the black hole potential is given by a form which reproduces the effects of a marginally stable orbit ( e.g. that of @xcite ) .",
    "second , the equation of state was likewise very simple in the initial calculations , and we have maintained it in the present work .",
    "the only change we apply is that at @xmath30 the value of the index @xmath16 has been lowered for some runs ( see table  [ table : ics ] ) from 2 to 4/3 .",
    "we will also improve on the form of the equation of state in future simulations .",
    "third , the final conditions of the 3d calculations show that the self  gravity of the disk is not too important in determining its structure ( it is pressure support that makes the rotation curve deviate from what would be expected for point masses orbiting a massive body , see e.g. figure  8b in l01 ) .    the second important new ingredient ( the first one being the assumption of azimuthal symmetry ) in the present simulations is the transport of angular momentum by viscosity , which is modeled by including all the terms derived from the stress tensor @xmath31 in the equations of motion ( we use the formalism developed by @xcite ) .",
    "we have :    @xmath32    where the commas indicate partial derivatives .",
    "the last term arises from the presence of artificial viscosity ( see below ) .",
    "the tensor responsible for the viscous force is @xmath33 , given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dynamical viscosity coefficient , and the shear is : @xmath36 the energy dissipation per unit mass is : @xmath37    to perform a dynamical calculation , at this point one needs to fix a prescription for the viscosity . we have chosen to parametrize its magnitude by using an @xmath1law , setting @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the adiabatic sound speed and @xmath40 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "this formulation of the viscosity has been used before in time ",
    "dependent studies of accretion flows in two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "we note that the simulations reported here are followed for a timescale that is much longer than the viscous one , and thus solutions that are qualitatively steady are obtained in all cases ( they can not be steady quantitatively simply because there is no external agent feeding the disk with matter as the simulation progresses ) .",
    "the implementation of sph for the present 2d azimuthally symmetric calculations requires the writing of the above expressions in cylindrical coordinates . for completeness , we give here the full set of equations for momentum and energy : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the distance to the origin , and the artificial viscosity terms are computed using the prescription of @xcite to minimize the effects of artificial shear on the evolution of the disk .",
    "the explicit forms of the acceleration and the energy dissipation for a given sph particle are : @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the sph interpolation kernel given by @xcite , adapted to azimuthal symmetry : @xmath49 we have @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the form - function for particle _ i _ defined by @xmath53 the factor @xmath54 in the denominator prevents numerical divergences . the smoothing length and sound speed for particle _",
    "i _ are denoted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are constants of order unity ( we use @xmath59 ) .",
    "the number of neighbors for the hydrodynamical interpolation is kept fixed at @xmath60 .",
    "artificial viscosity is used in sph to model the presence of shocks and avoid particle inter - penetration .",
    "the forms initially employed have been substantially improved over the years , with an accompanying reduction in spurious numerical effects .",
    "most notably , the one we use here is such that the shear viscosity is suppressed when the compression in the fluid is low and the vorticity is high ( @xmath61 , as is the case in accretion disks with differential rotation ) , but remains in effect if compression dominates in the flow ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we are able to monitor just how important the dissipation due to artificial viscosity is , compared with that arising from the stress tensor @xmath33 ( see equation  [ eq : diss ] ) .",
    "we employed two different values of the viscosity parameter @xmath1 for the runs shown here ( see table  [ table : ics]):@xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "for both cases , the energy dissipated through artificial viscosity is most important at early times ( @xmath65  ms ) , and quickly decreases relative to the terms generated through @xmath31 ( see below ,  [ results ] ) .",
    "we have tested our code to ensure that the viscous terms are computed correctly .",
    "the most simple test is to calculate the spreading of a ring of gas due to viscosity ( with no vertical structure ) orbiting a point mass , when pressure effects and self  gravity are neglected .",
    "this problem has an analytic solution in terms of bessel functions @xcite , which can be easily compared with a numerical solution .",
    "our code reproduces this calculation accurately , with the ring spreading radially on the correct timescale .",
    "we have also performed a second class of tests , allowing for vertical structure in azimuthal symmetry , studying the evolution of thick tori , where pressure effects are important and self  gravity is neglected .",
    "two different types of calculations were performed . in the first , a torus in hydrostatic equilibrium around a black hole , with an initially specified distribution of specific angular momentum , was allowed to evolve , switching the viscosity on at the start of the calculation @xcite . in the second ,",
    "a continuous flow of matter was injected at a large radius , and a disk was formed on the viscous timescale @xcite . for each of these ,",
    "several values of the @xmath1 parameter were used , ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath66 .",
    "we found excellent agreement with previously published results , both qualitatively and quantitatively @xcite .",
    "finally , we assume that all the energy dissipated in the flow is radiated away in neutrinos , and thus in this respect , the flow is an ndaf ( neutrino dominated accretion flow ) , as done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by directly removing from the fluid the internal energy associated with the first term in equation ( [ eq : diss ] ) .",
    "the neutrino luminosity is then given by @xmath67 .",
    "the energy dissipated by artificial viscosity remains in the disk as internal energy .",
    "this is another aspect that clearly needs to be treated in a more realistic manner and will be dealt with in future work .",
    "the choice of parameters shown in table  [ table : ics ] for the simulations allows us to explore the effect of numerical resolution on the results ( runs d and e , and runs f and g differ only in the initial number of particles ) , as well as that of the magnitude of the viscosity , the compressibility of the gas in the disk , and the initial mass of the black hole . for a lower black hole mass",
    "@xmath68 the accretion disk is initially more massive , and the spin angular momentum of the black hole is larger .",
    "this is a reflection of the previous binary evolution and tidal disruption that led to the formation of the accretion disk .",
    "the initial conditions we have used for the accretion disks clearly do not correspond to a simple equilibrium configuration , since they are derived from three  dimensional dynamical calculations . in our case , the disks are initially hot ( the internal energy is about 10  mev / nucleon , see figure  8 in l01 ) , and thus pressure support is important , making them quite thick ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this energy reservoir is not entirely lost , since only the energy dissipated through the physical viscosity is radiated away in neutrinos . thus the disks remain thick throughout the dynamical evolution .",
    "all the dynamical calculations are qualitatively similar .",
    "we show snapshots of the density and velocity field in the disk at various times for runs e ( @xmath63 ) and g ( @xmath64 ) in figures  [ rhoeg ] and [ veg ] . at the start of the calculation ,",
    "the disk flattens slightly , on a vertical free  fall timescale @xmath70  ms , since it is not in strict hydrostatic equilibrium at @xmath30 .",
    "the initial panels ( at @xmath71  ms ) show the formation of a weak shock at @xmath72  km , formed when the outer regions of the torus move radially inwards .",
    "this front moves subsequently outwards , and has practically left the inner region of the disk by @xmath73  ms .",
    "thereafter accretion proceeds onto the black hole in a characteristic pattern , which is mainly dependent on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the simulations use a variable smoothing length @xmath74 to ensure an accurate interpolation of the fluid variables , and so the spatial resolution ( which is essentially equal to @xmath74 ) , is also variable .",
    "it is smallest in the regions of highest density ( in the midplane of the disk ) . at @xmath75",
    "s , the smallest scales that can be resolved are of order @xmath76  cm=200  m at @xmath77  km , and @xmath78  cm=3  km close to the surface of the disk ( where @xmath79  g  @xmath80 for the high  resolution runs e and g ; in two dimensions the smoothing length scales with the number of particles as @xmath81 ) .",
    "the circulation patterns seen in figure  [ veg ] are much larger than the spatial resolution and thus are clearly resolved .",
    "the runs with a lower number of particles have a slightly poorer resolution , but nevertheless resolve the same global features clearly in terms of accretion rate , spatial extension of the disk and circulation patterns .    for a high viscosity ,",
    "a large  scale circulation is established , with @xmath82 .",
    "there is outflow in the equatorial plane at large distances from the black hole , and accretion takes place only along the surface of the disk and in the equatorial plane quite close to the black hole ( @xmath83  km ) .",
    "the radial velocities are subsonic , and the turnaround in @xmath84 occurs in large eddies close to the surface of the disk , when the gas is moving away from the equatorial plane .",
    "the disk slowly spreads in the radial direction , with an accompanying drop in density and accretion rate ( at @xmath21  s , @xmath85 has dropped by about one order of magnitude compared to its value at 10  ms , see also figure  [ mdotbz]a below ) .    for the low viscosity case , the flow is more complicated .",
    "accretion onto the black hole still occurs only along the surface of the disk and in the equatorial plane at small values of @xmath86 . however , the circulation patterns are present on smaller scales than before , with @xmath87 .",
    "the flow is qualitatively steady after approximately 20  ms , but the eddies persist throughout the simulation .",
    "the radial spread of the disk is less pronounced than before , due to the lower value of @xmath1 , and thus higher densities are maintained for a longer period .",
    "the accretion rate onto the black hole is about one order of magnitude lower ( for @xmath88  ms ) than for the high viscosity runs , and decreases more slowly .",
    "the circulation patterns described above can be clearly related to the distribution of specific angular momentum @xmath89 in the disk .",
    "we show in figure  [ lrz ] the contours of @xmath89 for runs e and g at @xmath90  ms .",
    "as one moves from the equator ( where @xmath91 to the surface of the disk at a given value of @xmath86 , @xmath89 decreases until the fluid turns around and flows inward .",
    "for both cases , the magnitude of the velocities ( radial and vertical ) in the disk decreases in time , with the circulation patterns becoming less intense in that respect .",
    "figure  [ ls ] shows views of the disks for runs e and g at @xmath92  s on a larger scale .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the black hole is clearly sensitive to the value of @xmath1 , and to a lesser extent , on the adiabatic index @xmath16 , as can be seen in figure  [ mdotbz]a .",
    "runs e and g differ only in the value of @xmath1 , and clearly lowering the viscosity leads to less vigorous transport of angular momentum , and thus to a reduced @xmath93 . runs e and c differ only in the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the less compressible case ( run c , with @xmath18 ) has a broader spatial mass distribution and reaches lower peak densities .",
    "thus slightly more mass is initially closer to the accretor and easily absorbed , giving a larger @xmath93 , and subsequently a faster drop ( by @xmath21  s , the disk mass is lower in run c than in run e , see table  [ table : evol ] ) .",
    "finally , run b differs from run e in the initial binary system that gave rise to the accretion disk , with a larger @xmath68 and smaller @xmath94 , which is responsible for the lower accretion rate .",
    "meridional circulation patterns like the ones seen in the present simulations have been studied before , both analytically and numerically . solving for the vertical structure of an accretion disk and using an @xmath1 viscosity",
    ", @xcite found that the radial flow can change direction in the midplane of the disk , with @xmath95 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite assumed a steady state in a polytropic @xmath1disk and found solutions which exhibited outflow along the equator , with inflow along the disk surface and in the equator close to the accretor , as seen here . in their study",
    "it was the value of @xmath1 that fixed the equatorial distance at which the flow turned from inflow to outflow ( the stagnation radius ) . in both cases",
    ", the authors assumed that the disk cools efficiently , with the dissipated energy being radiated away .    to our knowledge",
    ", numerical work has been performed so far mainly with eulerian codes , in which boundary conditions need to be specified .",
    "@xcite obtained outflow in the midplane of the disk , and inflow along the surface , as in the solution found by @xcite , but the use of height  averaged boundary conditions enforced artificial circulation at the edges of the computational domain , thus altering the flow structure substantially . in other cases ,",
    "a free outflow condition is used , meaning that gas which leaves the computational domain can not re  enter it at a later time",
    ". these calculations  which , contrary to what we have assumed , suppose that the dissipated energy is advected with the flow  have also revealed circulation patterns and inflows / outflows with morphologies that depend on the magnitude of the viscosity @xcite .",
    "the use of sph is clearly an advantage in this sense , since there are no boundary conditions at all and the modeling of the fluid is not restricted to a particular region in space .",
    "there are several instabilities that can affect massive accretion disks dynamically and shorten their lifetimes considerably , compared with the viscous timescale .",
    "one of these is the `` runaway radial '' instability , first discussed in the context of massive accretion disks at the centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "a number of different effects can work to enhance or suppress this phenomenon , namely ( i ) the spin of the black hole , ( ii ) the distribution of angular momentum in the disk , given by @xmath96 , ( iii ) the effects of general relativity and",
    "( iv ) the self ",
    "gravity of the disk .",
    "the first two ( large kerr parameter and a high value of @xmath97 ) tend to suppress the instability @xcite , while the others tend to enhance it @xcite .",
    "the numerical approach used here allows us only to comment on ( ii ) .",
    "the distribution of angular momentum in the disk can be approximated by a power law in the three  dimensional sph coalescence simulations , with @xmath98 , i.e. quite close to keplerian ( see figures 10b and 8b in @xcite and l01 respectively ) .",
    "this does not vary appreciably as the calculations progress , despite the circulation of the fluid in the disk described above in  [ circulation ] , and thus we find that the disk is stable in this respect .    additionally , disks can be unstable to axisymmetric perturbations depending on their surface density and temperature ( measured through the sound speed @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is known as toomre s stability criterion , and can be quantified through @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the local epicyclic frequency and @xmath102 is the mass surface density : @xmath103 for @xmath104 the disk is stable to axisymmetric perturbations , and unstable otherwise .",
    "this condition tells us that a dense , cold disk is more likely to be unstable than a hot , thick one ( such as the ones treated here ) .",
    "we find that for all our runs , @xmath104 .",
    "the profile of @xmath105 is such that at a given instant in time , there is a minimum @xmath106 at a certain radius ( close to the maximum in density , see figure  [ qr ] ) .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath106 occurs at @xmath30 , where @xmath107 .",
    "as the disk evolves , the density drops and both parameters increase . by @xmath21",
    "s , we typically find @xmath108 .",
    "the artificial viscosity mentioned above in  [ method ] ideally should not affect the accretion flow substantially , otherwise the results would be difficult to assess . as a measure of the effect",
    "the terms arising from it have on the disk , we plot in figure  [ lart ] the dissipated energy as a function of time , separated into the components arising from @xmath33 and those coming from artificial viscosity , for runs e and g ( the former is in fact what we have termed the neutrino luminosity @xmath109 above in  [ method ] ) .",
    "it is at early times ( @xmath65  ms ) that artificial viscosity is important .",
    "this is not surprising , since that is when the initial transient appears in the disk and the shock forms at @xmath110  km .",
    "thus the relative importance of the artificial viscosity merely means that it is working as one would expect . after this",
    "transient dies out , the dissipation rate becomes quickly dominated by the physical viscosity .",
    "it is also apparent that only for low values of @xmath1 ( run g with @xmath64 ) are the two terms comparable in magnitude in the initial stages .",
    "we are thus confident that our results are not affected significantly by the presence of artificial viscosity .",
    "we have computed the dynamical evolution of massive accretion disks around stellar - mass black holes in two dimensions ( with azimuthal symmetry ) , formed through the tidal disruption of a neutron star by a black hole in a close binary ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) .",
    "our initial conditions are taken from the final state of three dimensional hydrodynamical calculations of the coalescence process , by averaging in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we use newtonian physics , an ideal gas equation of state , and solve the equations of viscous hydrodynamics assuming an @xmath1 law for the viscosity coefficient . all the energy dissipated by the physical viscosity",
    "is radiated away ( in neutrinos ) .",
    "the time evolution is followed for 0.2  seconds .",
    "we find that after an initial transient of numerical origin , stemming from the fact that the 3d torus does not exhibit strict azimuthal symmetry due to the highly dynamical merging process ( see figures 2 and 7 in l01 ) , the disk settles to a qualitatively steady state .",
    "meridional circulations are promptly established , whose structure depends mainly on the value of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "most strikingly , there is an important motion of fluid from the inner regions of the disks to large radii , along the equatorial plane .",
    "the flow is directed towards the accreting black hole along the surface of the disk and in the equatorial region at small radii .",
    "the disks remain thick ( @xmath113 ) throughout the dynamical evolution , due to their large internal energy , with accretion rates on the order of one solar mass per second .",
    "the maximum densities decrease during our calculations , as there is no external agent feeding the disks , but remain at @xmath114  g  @xmath80 , with corresponding internal energy densities @xmath115  erg  @xmath80 .",
    "we stress that the evolution of accretion disks such as these should be studied with time ",
    "dependent models , since the system is clearly not in a steady state , even from its inception .",
    "the circulation pattern seen in figure [ veg ] would certainly lengthen their lifetimes by moving matter to larger radii continuously , an effect that would otherwise be omitted . to illustrate how important this can be , we considered the total radial mass flux in the disk , composed of two parts at any given value of the radial coordinate @xmath86 , @xmath116 where @xmath117 restricted to regions in which @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath95 for @xmath120 respectively . by definition , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "if there were no circulation in the disk and all matter moved radially inward one would have @xmath123 and @xmath124 . a measure of how important the circulations are , and",
    "how much they would lengthen the lifetime of the disks can be obtained by calculating the fraction of the gas flowing radially in the disk that is actually moving toward the accretor , i.e. @xmath125 . in the inner regions of the disks this ratio tends to unity , as can be seen from figure  [ veg ] .",
    "it decreases rapidly at larger radii , reaching about 1/3 for run e and 1/10 for run g at @xmath126  km midway through the simulations ( at @xmath75  s ) .",
    "thus most of the radial flow of gas actually cancels out in the circulations , with a residual amount left over moving toward the black hole .",
    "we now turn to the implications our calculations might have on models for the production of cosmological gamma ray bursts from coalescing compact binaries .",
    "the two main forms of energy release from the disk we consider are i ) neutrino emission and ii ) mhd flow , either through the blandford ",
    "znajek effect @xcite or by means of a magnetized wind .    in the first case",
    ", we make a rough estimate for @xmath109 and @xmath127 from the dissipated energy because of viscosity ( see table  [ table : evol ] ) , as mentioned above .",
    "we have made an estimate only for the total neutrino luminosity @xmath109 , and not for the _ annihilation _",
    "luminosity @xmath128 , which would determine if a relativistic fireball could be launched or not .",
    "the calculation of @xmath128 requires the use of a more realistic equation of state , which we will explore in future work . for the time being , we note that , regardless of the efficiency of energy conversion from neutrino luminosity to annihilation luminosity  which could be quite low , on the order of 1 per cent or less @xcite it appears that the time  dependence of @xmath109 , which follows that of @xmath93 ( see figure [ mdotbz]a and table [ table : evol ] ) , is such that neutrinos could only be responsible for a very short , almost impulsive energy release ( @xmath129 , so @xmath130 ) , and thus would be unable to power a burst lasting several tenths of a second or more . of course",
    "this does not mean that it would have a negligible impact on the structure of the burst itself .",
    "we note furthermore that in the detailed 3d calculations done by @xcite for the evolution of thick disks following the coalescence of two neutron stars , the `` neutrinosphere '' is quite close to an isodensity surface at @xmath131  g  @xmath80 , which is lower than the maximum densities present in the disks computed here , even at late times ( see figures  [ rhoeg ] and [ ls ] ) .",
    "@xcite have also performed 3d calculations of binary neutron star coalescence taking into account neutrino emission and scattering processes , finding as well that in the regions of highest density the material is opaque , in their case mainly because of scattering off heavy nuclei .",
    "thus it is clear that a complete picture must include an appropriate formulation of neutrino transport .    for the magnetic  dominated case we must make some assumptions , since our simulations do not incorporate the effects of magnetic fields explicitly . for the field to be able to extract the binding energy of the torus ,",
    "it should be anchored to it , and we assume its magnitude is directly related to the internal energy in the gas . for this purpose",
    "we show in table  [ table : evol ] the internal energy density @xmath132 at @xmath75  s in the inner regions of the disk ( at @xmath133 ( @xmath134  km for runs a and b , and @xmath135  km for runs c through g ) in the equatorial plane .",
    "it is of order @xmath136  erg  @xmath80 , and even larger for the case with low viscosity ( @xmath64 ) . from this",
    "we compute an estimate for the blandford ",
    "znajek luminosity as @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the kerr parameter of the black hole and the magnitude of the magnetic field is computed using @xmath139 ( this gives @xmath140  g in all cases ) .",
    "this is clearly the most optimistic scenario concerning energy release , in that it assumes that the magnetic field strength is at the equipartition value .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath141 is shown in figure  [ mdotbz]b for several runs . for a larger viscosity",
    ", the gas in the disk drains into the black hole on a shorter timescale , and thus the drop in @xmath141 is much faster than for a low value of @xmath1 ( in run g , @xmath142  erg  s@xmath143 is practically constant ) .    in principle",
    ", energy can be extracted over many dynamical timescales if magnetic fields can tap the rotational energy of the accretion disk and of the black hole . here",
    "@xmath144 is the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine measured in the fixed frame , where @xmath145 ( see figure [ mdotbz]b ) .",
    "for such a continuously fed fireball , a forward shock propagating into the external medium and a reverse shock moving back into the relativistic outflow will coexist on either side of the contact discontinuity",
    ". the latter may persist as long as a significant level of energy injection is maintained .",
    "the differential energy conservation relation for the self - similar blast wave can be written as @xmath146 @xcite , where the first term denotes steady energy injection , and the second accounts for possible radiative energy losses of the fireball , with @xmath147 and @xmath148 being dimensionless constants . in the adiabatic case ( no radiative losses ) @xmath149 and the lorentz factor evolves as @xmath150 @xcite . for @xmath151 , an analytical solution can be found : @xmath152(t",
    "/ t_0)^{q^{\\prime } } + e_{\\rm imp}(t / t_0)^{-\\kappa^{\\prime}}$ ] for @xmath153 , where @xmath154 describes the impulsive energy input . here",
    "@xmath155 is the characteristic timescale for the formation of a self - similar solution , which is roughly equal to the time for the external shock to start to decelerate . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the fireball scales with time as @xmath156 , with @xmath157 and @xmath148 connected by @xmath158 , and @xmath159 for an adiabatic blast wave expanding in a constant density medium . in the observer frame ,",
    "the arrival time at the detector @xmath160 is related to that in the fixed ( laboratory ) frame @xmath161 by @xmath162 , and @xmath163 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the differential energy conservation relation in the observer frame is now given by @xmath164 , and the integrated relation is @xmath165 here @xmath166 , and @xmath167 , @xmath168 . since @xmath169 , the comparisons between @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the following discussion are equivalent to the comparisons between @xmath147 and @xmath172 . at different times",
    ", the total energy of the blast wave may be dominated either by a continuous injection term or by the initial impulsive term ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . which of the two is dominant at a particular observation time @xmath160 depends both on the values of the two indices ( @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) , and on the relative values of @xmath173 and @xmath174 . if @xmath175 , the impulsive term always dominates since the first term is negative .",
    "for an adiabatic blast wave expanding in a constant density medium ( i.e. @xmath159 and @xmath176 ) , this condition yields @xmath177 . if @xmath178 , the continuous term will eventually dominate ( i.e. @xmath179 ) over the second term after a critical time @xmath180.\\ ] ] this is the case considered in many pulsar central engines @xcite .",
    "we then have @xmath181 and the fireball is completely analogous to the impulsive regime with @xmath182 .",
    "+ if initially @xmath183 , the critical @xmath184 after which the continuous injection becomes dominant could be much longer than @xmath185 , exerting a noticeable influence on the grb afterglow .",
    "we expect this to be the case either when the magnetic energy is below equipartition ( @xmath186 ) or when the timescale for the formation of a self  similar solution is small ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "because of the strong pinch that develops , a narrow jet that delivers its thrust in a narrow solid angle , @xmath188 , may be a common ingredient of strong rotating magnetic fields ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "we thus generally expect the magnetic outflow to be much more collimated than that produced by @xmath4 annihilation ( @xmath189 ) and the magnetic luminosity to be the dominant contribution . even in this case",
    ", the impulsive term @xmath174 may be responsible for either creating a cavity before the magnetized wind expands or for precursor emission .",
    "the detection of , or strong upper limits on , such features would provide constraints on the burst progenitor and on magnetar  like central engine models .",
    "an external shock can occur at much larger radii and over a much longer timescale than in usual afterglows , if the environment has a very low density .",
    "this may be the case for grbs arising from compact binary mergers that are ejected from the host galaxy into an external medium that is much less dense than the ism assumed for usual models ( where the particle density is @xmath190  @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is commonly assumed that compact mergers occur outside the host galaxies because of the long inspiral , due to the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "we note that recent calculations of evolutionary tracks of binary systems containing massive stars show that the merger events can occur on much shorter timescales and thus still within the host galaxy , because the initial binary separation is small @xcite",
    ".    our simulations would indicate that the central engine survives the initial , violent event that created it , and that it possesses enough energy to account for the energetics and durations of short grbs .",
    "however , they clearly can not tackle directly other relevant issues , mainly related to the evolution of the magnetic field , and its influence on the dynamics .",
    "magnetic instabilities could make the disk lifetime much shorter by effectively increasing the viscosity .",
    "the amplification of the magnetic field may be self  limiting due to magnetic stress , which would cause disk flaring .",
    "the properties of the expected variability depend strongly on the details of the configuration of the disk corona generated by the magnetic field , which is removed from the disk by flux buoyancy @xcite .",
