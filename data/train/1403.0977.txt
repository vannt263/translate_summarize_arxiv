    "the @xmath5 ion has been extensively introduced into different oxide hosts , such as : @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite and perovskite compounds @xcite to improve their luminescent properties .",
    "usually , li@xmath0 ions act as co - activators in these compounds .",
    "moreover , several studies showed that the @xmath5 ion addition affects positively the morphology of particles as well as the luminescent efficiency of oxide materials .",
    "the improved luminescence intensity can be originated from local crystal field symmetry breaking around the rare - earth ions by the @xmath5 doping .",
    "particularly , eu@xmath3 incorporation into ba@xmath11gdnbo@xmath12 ( bgn ) matrix modifies the luminescence spectrum due to the creation of emission centers , which generates specific red light @xcite . since li@xmath0 ion is very small , it can occupy any site in the bgn structure , either substitutionally , at the @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 sites , or interstitially . in both cases , to compensate the charge , additional defects are created , which can modify the local crystal field symmetry around the re ions .    recently , liu et al @xcite reported a detailed investigation about the synthesis and luminescence characterization of the bgn : eu@xmath3,dy@xmath3 and @xmath16 co - doped bgn : eu@xmath3,dy@xmath3 samples .",
    "they observed that the co - doping enhances the emissions of bgn : eu@xmath3/dy@xmath3 samples and related this enhancement to the charge compensation mechanism , which plays an important role in improving the luminescence efficiency of phosphors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigated the charge compensation mechanisms due to the @xmath16 incorporation into bgn : eu@xmath3 perovskite .",
    "we identified , by atomistic modelling and a simple overlap model , the most probable charge compensation mechanisms and the local symmetry breaking induced by li co - doping , which is the mechanism that enhances the luminescent properties .",
    "to model the pristine bgn crystal , a standard lattice - energy minimization using the general utility lattice program ( gulp ) code @xcite was performed .",
    "buckingham pairwise potentials were assumed for all interionic interactions , which were described together with the electrostatic interaction in the form :    @xmath17-\\frac{b_{ij } } { r_{ij}^{6 } } .\\ ] ]    in this equation , the first term describes the long - range electrostatic interaction between the ions of charge @xmath18 and @xmath19 separated by the distance @xmath20 ; the second term models the pauli short - range repulsion and the last term models the van der walls attraction . to compute the coulomb term ,",
    "the ewald summation @xcite , which is standard in gulp code , was employed .",
    "the barium and oxygen ions were treated by the shell model @xcite . in this model",
    "is assumed that the _ i@xmath21 _ ion is formed by a massless shell with charge @xmath22 and a core with mass @xmath23 whose charge is @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the valence of the _ i@xmath21 _ ion . to obtain a finite ionic polarizability the core is connected to the shell by a harmonic spring ,",
    "whose force constant is @xmath26 .",
    "gd@xmath3 , eu@xmath3 and li@xmath27 ions were modeled using a rigid ion model due to theirs low polarizability .",
    "the basic point defect energies were calculated using the mott ",
    "littleton method that considers the point defect in the centre of a region , in which all interactions immediately surrounding it ( region i ) are treated explicitly , while a continuum approach is used for more distant regions from the defect ( region iib ) .",
    "these two regions are connected by another one region called iia , in which ions are allowed to relax , but assuming that they are in harmonic potential wells .",
    "typical region radii of 12  ( region i ) and 16  ( region iia ) were adopted .",
    "the electronic transitions of the eu@xmath3 ion were calculated using the modified crystal field theory based on the judd-ofelt theory @xcite . in this theory , the energies are related to the crystal field hamiltonian ( @xmath28 ) by : @xmath29 in this equation , the @xmath30 parameters describe the contribution of the dopant ion to the crystal field hamiltonian , while the @xmath31 parameters describe the corresponding contribution of the eu@xmath3 surrounding oxygen ions . to calculate the @xmath31 parameters the simple overlap ( so ) model @xcite was employed .",
    "the initial data used in the so model were the dopant ion position and the relaxed positions of the surrounding ions , which were obtained by the defect calculations .",
    "this method was employed with success to optical transitions for other materials @xcite .",
    "bgn crystallizes in a tetragonal distorted perovskite that derives from the cubic rock salt double perovskite structure .",
    "however , as the tetragonal distortion is small , bgn can be well described by the pseudocubic structure @xcite .",
    "we assumed a previous complete set of potentials assumed to model the pristine bgn crystal @xcite , which is listed in table [ pot ] .",
    "this potential set exhibits an excellent reliability to model the structural properties of bgn . besides",
    ", the dielectric properties of bgn were remarkably modeled by this potential data , which is a necessary condition for consistent defect calculation @xcite .",
    "the good reliability of the potential set assumed can be checked comparing the error between calculated and experimental values for structural and dielectric properties of bgn , which are lower than 1% .",
