    "+ the geometric intuition of what we want to find ( blue ) given two divisors with disjoint supports : +        using mumford representation , if @xmath75 is a reduced divisor as in the corresponding theorem , and we denote the places as @xmath117 , then @xmath118 with @xmath119 and @xmath120 for all @xmath117 so @xmath121 and @xmath122 , so the addition is done as following : +   + @xmath123 + @xmath124 +   + we want to find @xmath125 as in the previous figure to represent @xmath126 , this results inverting @xmath127 and @xmath128 +   + to find the other elements of @xmath129 @xmath127 and @xmath130 we have to find the interpolation polynomial for the given places , square it and then making it equal to @xmath105 : +   + we have that : + @xmath131 +   + if we solve : +   + @xmath132 mod @xmath133 + @xmath134 mod @xmath135 +   + with @xmath136 we will have : +   + @xmath137 + @xmath138 +   + so @xmath139 and we will have a @xmath140 system of equations , the solutions are going to be the coefficients @xmath141 of @xmath142 , if we do the calculations reducing @xmath143 modulo @xmath133 and @xmath143 modulo @xmath135 we can find that @xmath144 in general induces a matrix +   + @xmath145 mod @xmath146 +   + @xmath147 mod @xmath148 +   + this induces 4 equations : +   + @xmath149 + @xmath150 + @xmath151 + @xmath152 +   + as we know the values @xmath153 and we want @xmath154 to find the coefficients of @xmath142 the system is this : + @xmath155.\\ ] ] the solution of this matrix give us the coefficients @xmath141 of @xmath142 having this we just have to make it equal to the hyperelliptic curve @xmath105 : + @xmath156 + this happens because @xmath157 and it has @xmath95 and @xmath158 as factors and the coordinates of @xmath61 are roots of the places of @xmath159 and @xmath160 so @xmath161 is the polynomial of degree 2 resulting of the quotient and this is going to have as roots the coordinates of @xmath61 in @xmath162 .",
    "+ to find @xmath163 we have that @xmath164 we just have to evaluate the roots of @xmath161 in the hyperelliptic curve @xmath165 over @xmath166 but this can be a problem ( computing roots ) so another way is to check that : +   + @xmath167 + with this we have @xmath168\\oplus [ d_{2}]= [ d_{3}]=(u''(x),v''(x))$ ] .",
    "see  @xcite but here we will show a slightly different approach , which in this case is a particular case of the previous , suppose we have @xmath169 and we want to calculate @xmath170 $ ] , this divisor is linearly equivalent to a divisor with * prime places of degree two * : @xmath170 \\sim [ 2\\mu -2\\infty ] \\oplus [ 2\\omega - 2\\infty]$ ] what we have here is @xmath171 and @xmath172 , the geometric intuition is that we have two points which are tangent to the hyperelliptic curve with degree of intersection two in both : +        the mumford divisors are the following : +   + let @xmath173 and @xmath174 be two points ( places ) of the hyperelliptic curve @xmath0 of genus two , @xmath169 , we will calculate +   + @xmath170 = [ d_1]\\oplus [ d_2 ] = [ 2[\\mu-2\\infty]\\oplus [ 2\\omega-2\\infty]$ ] +   + @xmath175=<x^2 - 2x\\mu_x+{\\mu_x}^2,\\frac{dc}{dx}(\\mu_x,\\mu_y)x-\\frac{dc}{dx}(\\mu_x,\\mu_y)\\mu_x+\\mu_y>$ ] + @xmath176=<x^2 - 2x\\omega_x+{\\omega_x}^2,\\frac{dc}{dx}(\\omega_x,\\omega_y)x-\\frac{dc}{dx}(\\omega_x,\\omega_y)\\omega_x+\\omega_y>$ ] +   + here we built the quadratic polynomial as a double root in the @xmath61 coordinate of the prime place of each divisor , and we used formal differentiation for the linear part to get the tangent line to the curve @xmath0 at the given point ( place ) .",
    "+   + so , using the matrix in the case 1 we need to solve for @xmath177 such that @xmath178 : + @xmath179 + @xmath180 + @xmath181 + @xmath182 +   + @xmath183 + @xmath184 + @xmath185 + @xmath186    @xmath187.\\ ] ] in the same way with the solution of this system with get the coefficients of @xmath142 and the new places to do hyperelliptic involution , so we are ready to compute @xmath170=(u'(x),v'(x))$ ] +    in this new case we have that both divisors share a place @xmath188 , let @xmath189 and @xmath190 , we will need to detect explicitly the repeated place @xmath36 to calculate this case given the divisors in the mumford notation , but this is easy because if @xmath168=<u_1(x)=x^2+ax+b , v_1(x)>$ ] and @xmath191=<u_2(x)=x^2+\\alpha x+\\beta , v_2(x)>$ ] the matrix generated by case 1 must be singular , so @xmath192 and @xmath193 have a common root so @xmath194 implies that the repeated root @xmath61 is @xmath195 , having this we have that @xmath196 and the other places @xmath197 and @xmath198 can be calculated directly , so we are ready to calculate the addition in this case .",
    "we see here the place @xmath36 of degree 2 ( blue curve tangent point at @xmath0 ) .",
    "+   + so we rewrite @xmath199 and @xmath200 as : + @xmath201 + @xmath202 +   + and we have the mumford divisors in the following way : +   + @xmath175=<x^2 - 2sx+s^2,\\frac{dc}{dx}(s , t)x-\\frac{dc}{dx}(s , t)s+t>$ ] + @xmath176=<x^2-x(\\mu_x+\\omega_x)+\\mu_x\\omega_x,\\frac{\\mu_{y}-\\omega_{y}}{\\mu_{x}-\\omega_{x}}x+\\frac{\\mu_{x}\\omega_{y}-\\omega_{x}\\mu_{y}}{\\mu_{x}-\\omega_{y}}>$ ] +   + here we have that @xmath175 $ ] has a multiple root at @xmath203 and the linear part is the tangent line at @xmath204 over @xmath0 and @xmath176 $ ] the linear part is the line through @xmath205 and @xmath206 , and the quadratic part has @xmath207 and @xmath208 as roots .",
    "+ we use the case 1 and we have that : + as in the other cases we use the matrix of case 1 to obtain the coefficients of the interpolation polynomial @xmath111 with @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath178 .",
    "so we solve for @xmath177 the following matrix : + @xmath209.\\ ] ]    jacobians of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 are a good candidate for asymmetric cryptography , so optimization of its endomorphism is an important task , the work of costello  @xcite is very important because it shows that the calculation of the addition in @xmath210 can be done solving a system of linear equations over the base field in two cases given mumford divisors of a genus 2 curve jacobian , we have extended with a similar approach a third case when both divisors to add in the jacobian share a point , the existence of the solution is backed up by the artin s approximation theorem , the figures shown in this work were calculated using these formul .      siegfried bosch _ algebraic geometry and commutative algebra_. + springer , utx 2013 .",
