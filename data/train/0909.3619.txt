    "<S> 1.0 mm    pacs numbers : 41.20.jb , 42.25.gy , 42.79.-e    since pendry _ et _ al . </S>",
    "<S> and leonhardt proposed an interesting idea to design invisibility cloaks [ 1,2 ] , more and more attention has been paid to the cloaks and other optical transformation devices [ 3 - 16 ] . </S>",
    "<S> recently , lai _ et _ al . have presented a concept of illusion optics : making an object with arbitrary shape and material properties appear exactly like another object of some other shape and material makeup [ 13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> invisibility cloak can be regarded as generating an illusion of free space [ 1 - 5 ] . using the transformation optics , </S>",
    "<S> they designed an illusion device consisting of two distinct pieces of metamaterials , which are called _ complementary medium _ and _ restoring medium_. however , the complementary medium was obtained from the transformation optics of folded geometry . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is composed of left - handed materials with simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the proposed illusion device is extremely demanding of material parameters , and the applications are possible to remain in the realm of theory [ 18 ] .    in this letter , we present a class of optical transformation media which can make the enclosed actual object invisible and generate one or more virtual objects at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrary object enclosed by such a medium layer appears to be one or more other objects of arbitrary shapes and material makeup . as applications , we design an illusion device , which transforms an actual object into two virtual objects . </S>",
    "<S> such a device exhibits unusual electromagnetic ( em ) behaviors as verified by full - wave simulations . </S>",
    "<S> here , we try to make the illusion media be fairly realizable . unlike the published illusion devices which are composed of left - handed materials [ 13 ] , all permittivity and permeability components of the proposed illusion media are finite and positive . </S>",
    "<S> hence the presented approach makes it possible to realize the illusion media using artificial metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> the principle behind such illusion media is not only bending em waves around the actual object , but also generating one or more virtual objects within the virtual boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> an intuitive schematic to illustrate the proposed method is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . a golden apple ( the actual object ) </S>",
    "<S> is enclosed with an illusion medium layer , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a layer of illusion media makes any detector outside the virtual boundary ( the dashed curves ) perceive the scattering fields of two green apples ( the virtual objects , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) instead of one golden apple . in the other word </S>",
    "<S> , the illusion medium layer makes the em fields outside the virtual boundary in both the physical and virtual spaces exactly the same , regardless the direction of the incident waves . </S>",
    "<S> the illusion medium layer has two functions , concealing the optical signature of the golden apple and generating the image of two green apples . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate transformation of the illusion medium layer is similar to that of an invisibility cloak , but the illusion space contains some virtual objects with given em parameters instead of purely free space . </S>",
    "<S> the permittivity and permeability tensors of the illusion media are calculated by @xmath0 in which @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the constitutive tensors in virtual space ( illusion space ) and the physical medium layer , respectively , and @xmath5 is the jacobian transformation matrix with components @xmath6 , corresponding to the mapping from the illusion space to the illusion medium layer .    </S>",
    "<S> similar to invisibility cloaks , the em fields in the illusion medium layer can be found from the transformation optics [ 1,2 ] as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are electric and magnetic fields in the virtual space , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> because the boundary @xmath11 is mapped to itself during the transformation @xmath5 , we have @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the subscript @xmath14 indicates transverse components along the surface @xmath11 . in another word , </S>",
    "<S> the tangential components of the em fields on the whole virtual boundary ( @xmath11 ) are exactly the same in the physical and virtual spaces . </S>",
    "<S> hence , by the uniqueness theorem , the em fields outside are also exactly the same . </S>",
    "<S> any detector outside the illusion medium layer will perceive em waves as if they were scattered from the illusion object ( two green apples and nothing else ) , and thus an illusion is generated . in the design of invisibility cloaks , </S>",
    "<S> the illusion space is only free space , hence there were almost no scattered fields from a perfect cloak . </S>",
    "<S> for the illusion media , however , the illusion space may contain many illusion objects of our choice , thus the scattered fields are the same as those from the virtual objects .    in order to demonstrate the design of illusion medium layer </S>",
    "<S> , we take an illusion device as example and make full - wave simulations based on the finite element method . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an illusion medium layer which transforms a metallic square cylinder to two dielectric square cylinders . in the following simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the case when a transverse - electric ( te ) polarized plane wave is incident upon an illusion medium layer , hence there exists only @xmath15 component of electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the case is very similar when a transverse - magnetic ( tm ) wave is incident .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 illustrates the numerical results of scattered electric fields for an illusion medium layer which transforms one metallic square cylinder to two smaller dielectric square cylinders . in order to illustrate the scattering character of objects better , </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the scattered fields instead of total fields here and next . </S>",
    "<S> the plane waves are incident horizontally from the left to the right at 12 ghz . figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(c ) show the scattered patterns of the single metallic square cylinder without the illusion medium layer and two dielectric square cylinders with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . when enclosed by the illusion medium layer , the scattered pattern from the single metallic square cylinder will be changed as if there were two smaller dielectric square cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> this can be clearly observed by comparing the scattering - field pattern of the metallic cylinder coated by the illusion medium layer shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) with that of two dielectric cylinders shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the field patterns are exactly the same outside the virtual boundary . inside the virtual boundary , the field patterns in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) and 2(c ) are different .    unlike the earlier - proposed illusion devices which consist of two distinct pieces of metamaterials - the complementary medium with double negative constitutive parameters and the restoring medium [ 13 ] , the illusion medium layer in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) is only composed of one layer of inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium . </S>",
    "<S> to design such an illusion medium layer , we first consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) one obtained by rotating the mirror - symmetric square around the _ </S>",
    "<S> x_-axis . </S>",
    "<S> we construct the transformation for each side in the cartesian coordinate system , which can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a compression factor , i.e. , the ratio of the sizes of actual and virtual spaces . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that the corresponding side of polygonal metallic cylinder be expressed as @xmath21 . in this example , the side length of each virtual object is 0.02 m and @xmath22 . based on the above transformation , the permittivity tensor of the illusion medium layer can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain two - dimensional ( 2d ) parameters by setting @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the component @xmath30 is constant . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic permeability can be expressed in a similar way , and we omit the expressions here . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that a 3d transformation have been constructed in equation ( 2 ) instead of a 2d transformation to eliminate the singularity of the em parameters [ 11,17 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that the illusion objects are isotropic : @xmath31 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> for two trapezia regions in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which generate the illusion of two square dielectric cylinders ; for other regions in the illusion medium layer , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which generate the illusion of free space . </S>",
    "<S> due to the non - conformality of the transformation , some non - diagonal components of the constitutive tensors are non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , the real fabrication requires the material parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be denoted in diagonal tensors . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the tensors @xmath35 and @xmath36 indicates that there always exists a rotation transformation which maps a symmetric tensor into a diagonal one . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the material parameters with the eigenbasis can be expressed as @xmath37 and all non - diagonal components are zero . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic permeability @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 have similar expressions , and are omitted here . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the relation between the virtual and physical coordinates can be established as @xmath41 .    for te - wave incidence , only @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> are of interest and must satisfy the request of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3)-(9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are illustrated in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a)-(b ) , from which we clearly see that all values are finite without any singularity . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the transformation in this illusion device is a compressing mapping , instead of the folding of geometry [ 10,13,16 ] . hence any parameters of the illusion medium layer is not negative </S>",
    "<S> this kind of metamaterials have been extensively studied and fabricated in the experiment of free - space cloaks at microwave frequency [ 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the experiment of the free - space cloak , such an illusion medium layer is restricted to a narrow frequency band because some parameter components go to zero near the inner boundary [ 3,15 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the illusion medium layer renders the enclosed metallic square cylinder invisible and projects the illusion of two dielectric square cylinders as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) .    in real applications , artificial metamaterial structures are always lossy . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is interesting to investigate the lossy effect of the medium layer on the illusion property . </S>",
    "<S> when we add a loss tangent of 0.01 in both permittivity and permeability of the illusion medium layer , the scattered electric - field distributions ( not shown ) are very similar to that of two dielectric square cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the lossy illusion medium layer is still effective .    </S>",
    "<S> the presented illusion medium layer could be realized by designing proper metamaterial structures . to achieve the permeability component @xmath42 , we can make use of the split - ring resonators ( srr ) [ 3,11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one kind of srr unit , the c structure , has been used for the design , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . from the retrieved permeability illustrated in the same figure , </S>",
    "<S> we could obtain the permeability component ranging from 0 to 0.7 by adjusting the srr s size , which satisfies the requirement to @xmath42 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> another kind of srr structure , which can be used to achieve the other permeability component @xmath43 , is demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the retrieved permeability varies from 2 to 5.2 by changing the srr s size , satisfying the requirement to @xmath43 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the component @xmath45 or 6 can be realized using the non - resonant structure - i shape [ 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> all the imaginary parts of electromagnetic parameters for the metamaterial units at the non - resonant frequencies are small enough to be neglected in the design of illusion medium layer . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that it is indeed a complicated work to optimize the overall design to make a compact layout of the illusion medium layer , which will be considered in the further work .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a class of optical transformation media , illusion media , which can create one or more virtual objects by using metamaterials . to eliminate the singularity of medium parameters for the illusion device </S>",
    "<S> , we construct the transformation in 3d . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in such illusion media , all components of constitutive parameters in the principle coordinate system are finite and positive and they could be realizable using artificial structures .    </S>",
