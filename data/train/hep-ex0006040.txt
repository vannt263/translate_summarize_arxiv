    "the fiducial volume begins 126 m downstream from the target and is contained in an evacuated cylindrical steel vessel 89  m long and 2.4  m in maximum diameter .",
    "the vessel is terminated at the downstream end by a kevlon - fiber composite window and followed immediately by the main na48 detector .",
    "the sub - detectors which are used in the k@xmath23 analysis are described below in order of succession ( see fig .",

    "a hadron calorimeter composed of 48 steel plates , each 24  mm thick , interleaved with scintillator is used in trigger formation and particle detection studies .",
    "candidate events were selected by a two - stage trigger . at the first level ,",
    "a trigger requiring adjacent hits in the hodoscope is put in coincidence with a total energy condition ( @xmath28 gev ) , defined by adding the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter with that seen by the trigger in the lkr calorimeter .",
    "the second level trigger uses information from the drift chambers to reconstruct tracks and invariant masses . for the 4-track part of the trigger , the number of clustered hits in each of the first , second , and fourth drift chamber had to be between 3 and 7 .",
    "all possible 2-track vertices were calculated online .",
    "at least two vertices within 6 m of each other in the axial direction had to be found .",
    "for the determination of the 4-track trigger efficiency , downscaled events that passed the first level were used .",
    "alternatively , events triggered with the neutral trigger - based on the data of the lkr calorimeter - were selected .",
    "the neutral trigger applied the following cuts to the events online : @xmath29 5 peaks in each projection , total energy @xmath30 50 gev , first moment of cluster energies ( ` center of gravity ' ) @xmath31 cm , and lifetime uncorrected for deflection in the magnet @xmath32 .    during the experimental runs ,",
    "roughly 100 terabytes of raw data with typically 20 kbytes per event were recorded .",
    "reconstructed output was stored in a compressed data format , 45 times smaller .",
    "in addition , several streams of data were formed for events accepted by about 40 filter modules for the analysis of neutral and charged two - pion decays , rare decays , and events for the detector calibration .",
    "the data sample which yields k@xmath33 also has been used to select k@xmath34 and k@xmath35 normalization events , with @xmath36 .",
    "the vertex was reconstructed from the 4 tracks by requiring that the sum of the squared transverse distances from the transverse vertex position , weighted by the inverse track momentum , be minimal .",
    "events were preselected by requiring two positive and two negative tracks with distance of closest approach to the vertex @xmath37  cm .",
    "all clusters in the lkr were required to be in a fiducial area given by an octogon about 5 cm smaller than the outside perimeter of the calorimeter and an inner radius of 15 cm . the distance to dead calorimeter cells had to exceed 2 cm to ensure negligible energy loss .",
    "the separation between cluster centers was required to be @xmath30 3 cm .",
    "the energy of each cluster was required to exceed 2 gev , well above the detector noise of 0.11 gev per cluster .",
    "electron candidates were identified by requiring that cluster centers in the lkr be within 1.5 cm of the calculated shower maxima based upon the extrapolation of each track .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure was measured to be @xmath38  @xcite . to reject pion showers , the ratio of cluster energy to track momentum @xmath39",

    "candidate events for the decay k@xmath33 with all tracks identified as electrons were selected . in principle , the following four classes of background sources are relevant :    * events with two decays k@xmath45 occuring at the same time and for which the pions were misidentified as electrons . being due to two coincident kaon",
    "decays the invariant mass of the system can be around and above the nominal k@xmath18 mass .",
    "these events are largely rejected by requiring a good vertex quality : the closest distance of approach of each track w.r.t .",
    "the reconstructed vertex had to be @xmath46 5 cm .",
    "events with separate vertices do not pass the level 2 trigger ( see above ) .",
    "+ finally it was required that the measured times for clusters associated to the electrons had to be consistent within 3 ns with each other .",

    "* events k@xmath47 , where the @xmath48 s undergo single or double dalitz decays or photons convert in the material of the detector , so that 2 positive and 2 negative electrons are detected . due to the missing photons",
    ", the invariant mass of the @xmath49 system is below the nominal k@xmath18 mass .",
    "the loose requirement that the square of the reconstructed transverse momentum @xmath50 of the reconstructed kaon with respect to the line joining the decay vertex and the k@xmath18 target must be less than 0.0005 ( gev / c)@xmath51 , restricts this background to less than 2.2% .",
    "the position of the cut is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt2 ] .",
    "the monte carlo simulation indicates that 1.5% of the signal events are lost by the @xmath50 cut . * events k@xmath52 and k@xmath15 , with conversion of the photons in the material upstream of the spectrometer also yield invariant masses around the nominal k@xmath18 mass .",
    "each pair of oppositely charged tracks was therefore required to be separated by @xmath53  cm in the first drift chamber as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : distdch](a ) .",
    "note that the conversion probability in the material of the na48 detector is of similar magnitude as that for internal photon conversion to a @xmath9 pair . as the angular opening of oppositely charged tracks peaks mostly at small angles ,",
    "60% of the signal events are lost by this cut ; according to the mc , there is no remaining background with converted @xmath54 s .",

    "[ fig : masskl ] . note the slightly asymmetric shape of the k@xmath18 mass peak , which is due to photons radiated off the electrons in the final state .",
    "[ fig : masskl ]    finally , a mass window of 0.475 gev/@xmath56 0.520 gev/@xmath57 was set to define the final sample . in total , 132 candidate events were selected in this way . from the number of events observed below the k@xmath18 mass peak and their distribution we estimate that the background contribution to the signal region is negligible .",
    "the four - track decay k@xmath34 , with @xmath36 , was used for normalization .",
    "only events that passed the pretrigger discussed above , downscaled by 60 , were selected .",
    "this sample was used to determine the efficiency of the 4-track trigger to be @xmath58 .",
    "the 4-track trigger is required for signal and normalization modes .    since both the signal and the normalization modes consist of 4-track events , uncertainties due to tracking tend to cancel in the ratio of acceptances .",
    "selection criteria similar to those used in the signal mode were applied .",
    "in addition , at least one extra cluster in the calorimeter not associated with a charged track was required .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath59 system had to be in the range of 0.115  0.155 gev/@xmath57 .",
    "monte carlo studies showed that 66 % of the reconstructed k@xmath60 candidate decays are from k@xmath61 with one of the external photons converting in the material of the detector ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : distdch](b ) ) .",
    "all other backgrounds have been estimated to be negligible . using these cuts ,",
    "17123 k@xmath62 decays were selected .    in a second analysis ,",
    "k@xmath35 events were selected , yielding 5167 events for normalization .",
    "while having a complicated topology of eight clusters , these events have the advantage that all decay products interact electromagnetically in the detector and that the radiative corrections should be similar to those in the signal mode .      for the simulation of the k@xmath33 acceptance , the matrix element was taken from ref",
    ".  @xcite neglecting the interference of the two virtual photons .",
    "the distribution of the angle spanned by the decay planes of the two @xmath9 pairs corresponds to a k@xmath18 which is assumed to be entirely cp@xmath63 .",
    "the photos  @xcite package has been used to simulate final state radiation both for the signal and normalization channels .",
    "the acceptance for k@xmath33 is calculated to be 7.8% for events generated in the range 45 gev @xmath64 gev and 5  m  @xmath65  m. the normalization to the k@xmath18 signal has been measured from the number of k@xmath66 decays in the same sample . using the acceptance of 1.34% , calculated by monte carlo simulation , a total number of @xmath67 k@xmath18 decays is obtained . with the cuts described above",
    ", the inclusion of radiative corrections decreased the acceptance of signal and normalization channel by 8.8% and 3.4% , respectively .",
    "consistent results for the total number of k@xmath18 were obtained when the alternative normalization channel , k@xmath68 , was used instead .",
    "a study of the stability of the branching ratio determination was made as a function of the cuts applied .",
    "a systematic error of 3.5% was estimated , mainly being due to the variation in the minimal distance of clusters from the beam pipe and the cut on the vertex quality .",
    "a second contribution comes from the 4-track trigger inefficiency . a monte carlo simulation of the level 2 algorithm yields a 95.0% efficiency for the normalization mode , in good agreement with the measured value .",
    "for the signal , the simulated efficiency is higher ( 99.8% ) .",
    "we chose not to apply a correction to the branching ratio ; instead we introduced a systematic error of @xmath695% for this preliminary result .",
    "finally , the effect of overflows in the drift chambers has been considered . if events with an overflow condition in a window of 312 ns around the event time are removed , 20% of the events are lost and the branching ratio stays constant within 1% .    adding these sources of systematic error in quadrature",
    ", we obtain a total systematic error of @xmath69 6.2% .    from the numbers given above ,",
    "a branching ratio of @xmath70 is obtained , where the statistical and systematical uncertainties as well as the uncertainty in the branching ratio of the normalization channel are given separately .",
    "this result is consistent with the theoretical expectation of  @xcite and the previous average value of ( @xmath71  @xcite , with 5 times the statistics of the single best previous experiment .    .",
