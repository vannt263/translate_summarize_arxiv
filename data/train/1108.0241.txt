    "since the foundation in late 1970s @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) has been a powerful tool to explore the strong interaction phenomena at large momentum transfers .",
    "this is such a kinematic region where the exclusive transition matrix element can be expressed as the convolution of the perturbative calculable coefficient and non - perturbative light - cone distribution amplitude ( da ) that describes the longitudinal momentum fraction of quarks , namely the so - called collinear factorization . in particular , with the availability of clean electromagnetic probes , the photon - pion transition form factor ( tff )",
    "will be the most ideal subject to test the validity of pqcd and partonic structure of pion .",
    "experimentally , the pseudoscalar mesons tffs have been measured by cello and cleo collaborations with the virtuality of one photon @xmath8 up to 9 gev@xmath1 and the other nearly on - shell  @xcite .",
    "the data fit very well the pqcd leading order interpolation formula  @xcite , which stitches together the chiral anomaly and pqcd asymptotic limit , @xmath9 where @xmath10 mev , @xmath11 mev  @xcite are the corresponding decay constants of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that nearly all the analyses up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) radiative and twist - four corrections favor the endpoint - suppressed or asymptotic - like pion da , which means that the first two nontrivial gegenbauer moments of the da are small and have opposite signs in the region of @xmath12 gev@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , the celebrated confirmation of pqcd dominance at large momentum transfers was shortly overwhelmed by the surprising babar measurement  @xcite .",
    "it shows that the rescaled pion tff exhibits a continuous growth at @xmath13 , even beyond the asymptotic limit of pqcd .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath7 and @xmath14 tffs seem to be consistent with the pqcd expectations .",
    "thus , a coherent understanding of the @xmath6 and @xmath15 tffs would be a necessity for resolving this puzzle .",
    "the babar observation immediately arouses tremendous interests in the pion tff . in the pqcd scheme ,",
    "the scaling violation of the babar data can be better explained by either a wider da with deep midpoint or even a flat one  @xcite .",
    "however , they both conflict with some other constraints such as the data at low @xmath8 , midpoint value of the pion da from light - cone sum rules  @xcite , or operator product expansion ( ope ) analysis for the leading handbag contribution  @xcite etc .",
    "moreover , a flat da means pion is an elementary field and can interact with quarks locally .",
    "thus , a quark loop can also give the logarithmic enhancement but with rather low constituent quark masses  @xcite .",
    "in this case , the qcd evolution is switched off , and the whole process is totally non - factorizable  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a rather flat da with vanishing endpoints may still be a temporary solution  @xcite taking into account that it is not supported by the @xmath16 quark behavior in the @xmath7 and @xmath14 tffs  @xcite .",
    "it is even claimed that a peculiar mechanism beyond the standard model is needed to explain the babar puzzle  @xcite .    in the chiral limit approximation",
    ", there is only one large physical scale in the hard part of pqcd calculation .",
    "so the power law is explicit and concrete . in turn",
    ", the abnormal growth of the rescaled pion tff implies that an additional mass scale would be present .",
    "a natural mechanism for generating a mass scale should satisfy the following constraints : i ) it should keep the general ope analysis . in another word , the solution should originate from non - ope or non - power corrections if only light quarks are involved ; ii ) the new mechanism should leave the chiral anomaly intact at @xmath17 since the room for the theoretical and experimental improvement is very small  @xcite ; iii ) the pqcd asymptotic prediction should be valid , though the current experimental region in the exclusive processes seems to be still far away from the asymptotic region determined in inclusive processes  @xcite ; iv ) the flavor symmetry breaking of the da should be explained in the same scheme , and it is better to keep su(3 ) flavor symmetry taking into account its big success in the effective theory ; v ) pion should be treated as a bound state of current quarks . it is necessary to make the new mechanism compatible with the numerous analyses for both the asymptotic - like da and collinear factorization before the babar data since they have been cross checked based on different powerful tools .",
    "to find a solution that satisfies the above constraints simultaneously seems not easy .",
    "in the literature there are also proposals to suggest that the babar puzzle may need explanations beyond qcd . however , before jump to any unusual solution , we should first have a full understanding of the evolution of non - perturbative mechanism from low to high @xmath8 . in principle",
    ", any solution satisfying those constraints based on qcd should be treated seriously .    in this work",
    ", we propose a novel prescription to address above questions as a compensation of pqcd .",
    "since non - perturbative flavor changing processes ( fcp ) may play a role as  mass transmutation \"  @xcite above certain momentum transfers , we assume that such non - perturbative mechanisms can be expressed in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom . with an effective lagrangian approach ( ela )",
    ", we shall show that intermediate meson loops have a peculiar evolution in terms of @xmath8 , which could be an important mechanism causing the tff deviations from the asymptotic behavior in the region of @xmath18 gev@xmath1 .",
    "babar collaboration recently also measured the @xmath19 tff  @xcite . a continuous growth of the rescaled tff ( or slow decrease of the tff )",
    "is observed clearly with the space - like momentum transfer square up to @xmath20 , which is caused by the large charm quark mass  @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that a small charm component in @xmath14 , which is needed to explain the abnormally large branch ratio of @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite , may cause large deviations from the asymptotic prediction in the medium momentum transfer region while affects little the low momentum transfer region  @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to speculate that the charm quark may play a role in the deviations from the asymptotic predictions in the babar kinematic region .",
    "the first possible qcd diagram is the photons fuse into a charm quark loop which then couples to two gluons .",
    "these two gluons then evolve to the pion through triangle anomaly .",
    "this factorizable charm loop is also a possible correction for the chiral anomaly  @xcite , and can not be recognized by the ope based only on the massless quarks .",
    "although the correction at @xmath17 , i.e. the chiral anomaly , is tiny , its evolution with the photon virtuality could make it relatively important in larger photon virtuality .",
    "unfortunately , for the case of pion transition it is an isospin suppressed process proportional to the @xmath16 quark mass difference .",
    "therefore , its influence on @xmath7 is much stronger than that on the pion . to avoid the isospin suppression",
    ", the @xmath16 quarks would interact with photons more directly , and the gluon exchanges between charm quark and light quark must be non - perturbative to evade the strong coupling suppressions",
    ". such a scenario can be equivalent to the introduction of the intermediate meson loops based on the quark - hadron duality argument .",
    "it will be our focus in this work to investigate such a non - perturbative effect on the pion tff in the babar kinematic region .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the effective lagrangian approach for the intermediate meson loops is introduced in sec .",
    "numerical results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "iii , and a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the @xmath5 mesons @xmath23 couplings to light pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite has the following expression : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 denotes the pseudoscalar octet mesons @xmath27 the corresponding lagrangians for the photon and @xmath5 couplings are @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and the vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not exist .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 are extracted from  @xcite : @xmath35 where the signs and relative size can also be deduced from constituent quark model , see also  @xcite for the lattice calculation .",
    "similarly , the coupling constant @xmath36  @xcite , and @xmath37 can be obtained from the heavy quark effective theory @xmath38    four types of loops would contribute to the pion tff , i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , where the @xmath5 mesons in the parentheses are the exchanged mesons between two photons .",
    "the kinematic conventions are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . the transition amplitude can be expressed as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the vertex functions given by the effective lagrangians , and @xmath45 are the denominators of propagators of the intermediate mesons , respectively .",
    "at hadronic level , the calculation of intermediate meson loops only includes @xmath46-wave ground state mesons . in our case ,",
    "the intermediate charmed mesons include @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , and in the strange sector @xmath51 and @xmath52 are considered . one essential question which is very often raised is the contributions from higher excited meson loops apart from those @xmath46-wave states .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that a complete set of intermediate meson loops should be included based on the quark - hadron duality argument . in our approach",
    ", the following reasons would allow us to only consider contributions from the @xmath46-wave states .",
    "firstly , for a given kinematic condition , we would expect that the local em dipole couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) would be much larger than the excited states due to quantum mechanical selection rules . for electric dipole couplings , e.g. @xmath53 ,",
    "the ground state would be less suppressed by the wavefunction overlaps than excited states .",
    "secondly , in many cases the quark - hadron duality is locally broken such that a subset of hadron loops would play a dominant role in observables . moreover , we find in numerical simulations that apart from the vertex couplings the loop integrals general decrease when the masses of the intermediate mesons increase . in this sense",
    "the contributions from the ground state @xmath46-wave intermediate meson loops can be regarded as a reasonable approximation . meanwhile , although we still lack a systematic evaluation of how good such an approximation would be in different circumstances , it interests us to explore such a possible mechanism that accounts for the non - factorizable contributions to the pion tff .",
    "we also note that in the process of @xmath54 , there exists a significant difference between @xmath33 and @xmath34 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) . in some other diagrams ,",
    "the neutral meson loops even vanishes , e.g. due to the @xmath55 vertex .",
    "it means that the isospin violation effects are actually enhanced by the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "also , a nonvanishing charmed meson loop contribution must be present in the low @xmath8 region which comes from the destructive sum between the charged and neutral @xmath5 meson loops . at sufficiently high @xmath8 the meson loop contributions should become negligible as expected by pqcd .",
    "the interesting question is at which range of @xmath8 such an effect becomes negligible .",
    "meanwhile , an associated difficulty is to model - independently quantify the loop contributions in a broad range of @xmath56 . in this sense",
    "our study is motivated to provide a qualitative estimate of the intermediate meson loop effects as part of the non - factorizable contributions in terms of @xmath8 .",
    "generally speaking , the loops suffer from ultraviolet divergence which means that we should replace the local coupling constants by the non - local form factors to suppress the divergence . as usually done , we introduce the form factor @xmath57 to take into account the off - shell effect of each vertex , which also reflects the substructure of external hadrons . with the large space - like momentum transfers , each vertex would be far off - shell . therefore , we adopt the following tri - monopole form in the calculation : @xmath58 this turns out to be a reasonable consideration by our numerical simulation .",
    "the cutoff @xmath59 can be parameterized as @xmath60 with @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the exchanged meson mass .",
    "parameter @xmath63 is usually taken at @xmath64 and not necessarily the same for different open flavors .",
    "meson loop contributions to pion tff .",
    "the other diagrams can be obtained by exchanging the photon momenta.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    apart from the @xmath47 loops , the kaon and @xmath65 loops can also contribute .",
    "the kaon loops are similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , where the coupling constants can be determined by experimental data  @xcite , i.e. @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the su(3)@xmath71 symmetry then gives @xmath72 .",
    "the introduction of an empirical form factor will bring in model - dependent features . in order to give a meaningful interpretation of the results",
    ", we outline the conditions for constraining the parameter @xmath63 as follows :    \\i ) for an adopted value of @xmath63 , the meson loop corrections to the tff at @xmath17 should be negligibly small in order not to conflict with the well established theoretical and experimental results for the chiral anomaly  @xcite . in practise , the @xmath47 or kaon meson loop contributions to the anomaly are restricted to be less than @xmath73 ( absolute value ) in comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : inter ] ) , @xmath74 .",
    "this serves as a strong constraint for the upper limit of @xmath63 .",
    "\\ii ) the form factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : formfactor ] ) introduces additional singularities into the integrals empirically  @xcite , which means that in order to reduce the model - dependence , parameter @xmath63 should have a sufficiently large value , e.g. @xmath75",
    ". this condition can be satisfied in @xmath3 since all the internal exchanged mesons are highly off - shell .",
    "\\iii ) we neglect @xmath65 meson loops because the numerical calculation shows that apart from couplings , their contributions are usually one order magnitude smaller than @xmath47 and @xmath51 loops .",
    "in addition , we do not include the non - strange light meson loops to avoid double counting .",
    "in fact , we find that the above conditions can indeed provide a stringent constraint on @xmath63 , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 can be determined in fig .  [",
    "fig:3](b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we plot pion tff given by the exclusive @xmath47 and kaon loops with @xmath78 and @xmath79 in terms of @xmath8 .",
    "it should be stressed that , the meson loop contributions to the chiral anomaly are nearly zero because of the destructive interferences from the @xmath47 and @xmath51 loops . it is indicated by the thick solid line at zero momentum transfer point in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . the dominance of @xmath47 loops over the kaon loops can be recognized . in particular , the @xmath42 loop exhibits an enhancement in the babar kinematics due to the relatively large coupling differences between the charged and neutral meson loops as shown in eq .",

    "the kaon loops are much smaller because of the destructive interferences among different loop amplitudes and smaller @xmath80 .",
    "a sensible feature of the @xmath47 loops is that , the total meson loop contribution decreases faster than pqcd with the increasing @xmath8 , thus , it guarantees the asymptotic prediction of pqcd at high @xmath8 .",
    "this is different from the logarithmic  @xcite or double logarithmic  @xcite growth predicted by some analyses with flat da or equivalent pion vertex function , although we should caution that the ela result at high @xmath8 is inevitably model - dependent .",
    "meson loop contributions to the pion tff .",

    "[ fig:3](a ) , the shadowed band is the exclusive contributions from the intermediate meson loops plus the pqcd prediction , which in this paper means the interpolation result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inter ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that there is no double counting between our meson loops and the pqcd interpolation result involving only the @xmath16 quarks .",
    "the range of the shadowed area is given by @xmath81 ( lower ) and @xmath82 ( upper bound ) with @xmath79 fixed .",
    "this is a rather conservative estimate of the meson loop contributions based on the above constraints on @xmath63 .",
    "it shows that the inclusion of the meson loops significantly improves the region of @xmath83 gev@xmath1 while affects little in @xmath84 gev@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the cello , cleo and babar experiments can be explained simultaneously without modifying conclusions obtained before .",
    "we also note that the discrepancies with the data at low @xmath8 are mainly caused by the pqcd interpolation formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : inter ] ) which would break down due to the growing importance of the qcd corrections with negative sign  @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that we do not try to fit the data and judge the possible configuration of the pion da .",
    "the meson loop mechanism only tells us that in the high momentum transfer region , the asymptotic - like pion da may be still compatible with the babar data .",

    "( b ) the @xmath63 dependence of the meson loop contributions to the chiral anomaly .",

    "it is thus natural to expect that the same formulation in the su(3)@xmath71 symmetry limit should keep consistent with the theoretical and experimental results for @xmath7 and @xmath14 , or at least for @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , the data  @xcite show that the rise of the rescaled tffs is much weaker than the rise of @xmath6 case .",
    "it implies that the @xmath16 components in @xmath7 and @xmath14 would be significantly different from that in @xmath6 if the analysis is only based on pqcd  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to examine the meson loop contributions here as a direct test of the proposed mechanism . it should be pointed out that a strict anomaly sum rule shows that the same non - perturbative non - ope correction to the continuum as in the pion tff should also be present in the @xmath7 and @xmath14 tff  @xcite , although the @xmath7 tff favors the result from the pqcd interpolation formula .",
