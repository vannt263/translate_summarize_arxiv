    "theoretical and experimental study of electron - positron pair creation in strong external fields is important for understanding the structure of the qed vacuum . in the past",
    ", pair production in relativistic heavy ion collisions was studied in detail @xcite . with the progress of laser technology , pair production via absorption of several real photons",
    "becomes increasingly interesting .",
    "there are various schemes of pair production in laser fields , for example the production with counter - propagating laser fields ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , for the observation it is necessary to come close to the critical electrical field strength @xmath1 @xcite which is still far away from experimental realisation .",
    "another way is to consider pair production in combined laser and coulomb fields .",
    "the coulomb field can originate from a moving ion .",
    "if the ion counterpropagates the laser beam at high speed , the laser s electric field strength and photon frequency are doppler shifted by the factor @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the relativistic lorentz factor of the ion .",
    "one usually distinguishes between the multiphoton and the tunneling regime of pair production . in the latter ,",
    "the laser field strength is close to the critical one and pair creation proceeds via the simultaneous absorption of a very large number of low frequency photons ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "an important quantity which arises in strong - field physics is the intensity parameter , @xmath5 , with the laser frequency @xmath6 and peak field strength @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the elementary charge , electron mass and speed of light , respectively .",
    "the tunneling regime corresponds to @xmath11 , thus to a high intensity and low frequency laser field .",
    "contrary , in the multiphoton regime the field strength is smaller , but the photon energies are sufficiently high to allow pair creation via the absorption of only a few photons .",
    "therefore , for the multiphoton regime @xmath12 .",
    "when electron - positron pairs are created in the vicinity of a nucleus , the electrons can be created either free or in a bound state .",
    "one refers usually to _ free - free _ and _ bound - free _ pair production , respectively . in the present work we consider bound - free pair creation in the multiphoton regime due to the head - on collision of a very fast bare ion or proton with a very intense x - ray laser field of linear polarization .",
    "x - ray free electron lasers ( xfel ) currently under construction at desy ( hamburg , germany ) and slac ( standford , california ) are predicted to obtain photon energies of @xmath13 kev and intensities of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "energy conservation demands @xmath15 , the energy of @xmath16 absorbed laser photons has to be greater than the rest masses of the produced particles .",
    "hence , together with acceleration of ions to a relativistic @xmath3-factor of around @xmath17 , pair creation with two or three photons from an xfel is possible as a nonlinear process .    in 1997 , the process of laser - induced pair creation has been observed at slac @xcite .",
    "a highly relativistic electron beam collided with a highly intense laser beam .",
    "energy conservation allowed the production of electron - positron pairs by absorption of five photons .",
    "two different mechanisms were found to be responsible for the process . on the one hand the breit - wheeler process where in a first step one or two photons are absorbed to create a highly energetic photon via compton scattering . in a second step",
    "this @xmath3 photon interacts with additional laser photons to create pairs .",
    "alternatively , pair production happens via the nonlinear bethe - heitler process in a single step by simultaneous absorption of several real photons in the coulomb field of the electrons to create pairs . in the analysis of the experiment",
    "it was found that the first process dominated over the second .",
    "in contrast , when the laser beam collides with heavy ions instead of electrons , the high masses of the ions suppress the breit - wheeler process substantially and the ( nonlinear ) bethe - heitler process plays the dominant role .",
    "bound - free pair creation has not yet been observed in laser - ion collisions , but in a similar way bound electrons have been detected in an experiment with relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . for small nuclear charge numbers @xmath18 bound - free pair creation is suppressed , but it is competitive with the free - free channel at intermediate and high @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the two competing channels of free - free and bound - free pair creation could be distinguished experimentally @xcite .",
    "theoretically the process of free pair creation by combined coulomb and laser fields has been investigated by several authors @xcite with a focus on the tunneling regime . also muon",
    "pair creation in laser - ion collisions has been calculated recently @xcite .",
    "bound - free electron - positron pair creation with single high - energy photons has been surveyed before ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but for the nonlinear case , i.e. the absorption of more than one photon , only a few calculations exist @xcite .",
    "both consider k - shell capture of the electron and a circularly polarized laser beam @xcite or an ultrashort , single - cycle electromagnetic pulse @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in relativistic laser - ion or laser - electron collisions also other qed processes can take place which arise from the nonlinear response of the vacuum due to virtual electron - positron pairs .",
    "this can lead , for example , to laser photon merging @xcite or the emission of unruh radiation @xcite .",
    "further nonlinear vacuum effects in strong laser fields comprise photon - photon scattering @xcite , photon splitting @xcite and changes in the refractive index @xcite .",
    "the creation of bound states in a supercritical ionic field was treated in @xcite .    in the present paper , we consider the bound - free channel of electron - positron pair production in xfel - nucleus collisions .",
    "in contrast to the earlier treatments of this problem @xcite , a laser beam of linear polarization is chosen .",
    "on the one hand this choice represents the more easily achievable case for experimental realization @xcite but leads on the other hand to more difficult calculations due to the appearance of the generalized bessel functions ( see eq .",
    "( [ genbessel ] ) ) . additionally , we consider not only the capture of the electron into the ground state , but also into excited states in the @xmath0-shell .",
    "this gives rise to corrections to the total bound - free production channel of @xmath19 .",

    "this is important because the bound state can decay via photoionization . for the given parameters the two pair production processes have approximately the same total rate ( @xmath174 , @xmath175 ) but scale differently with @xmath18 and @xmath6 . to obtain an estimate of experimental pair production rates one should take into account the pulse length and repetition rate as well as the projectile beam density .",
    "for example , when @xmath176 ions collide with a laser beam of @xmath177 fs duration and @xmath178 khz repetition rate @xcite , then the number of pair creation events per second is of the order of @xmath179 ( assuming perfect beam overlap ) .      for a relatively low intensity parameter @xmath12 ,",
    "the pair production rate scales with @xmath148 .",
    "the lowest possible photon order gives by far the largest contribution to the rate .",
    "if one increases the intensity , the higher photon orders become important whereas the two - photon process peters out at some intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ highxi ] ) .",
    "the phase space for the two - photon process diminishes as one increases the intensity and at one point the process is no longer possible due to energy conservation : the ponderomotive energy of the positrons becomes too large .",
    "eventually , the same happens successively for the higher photon orders but the black squares in fig .",
    "[ highxi ] indicate that the sum over all photon orders continues to increase . to estimate the contribution of all photons we calculated for each specific @xmath147 the rate for photon numbers from @xmath145 to @xmath142 and found out that they decrease exponentially for the larger @xmath16 values .",
    "from the exponential fit we were able to perform the sum to infinity , hence giving us an approximate result for all photon orders .",
    "we point out that the effect described here is analogous to the phenomenon of channel closing in above - threshold ionization of atoms @xcite .",
    "the results of this section are obtained by the same formalism as before ; note , however , that the existence of bound states in the @xmath180 domain is no longer evident since the laser field strength is very large and even exceeds the atomic binding field .",

    "apart from the capture in the ground state , the electrons can also be bound in higher states .",

    "pratt @xcite proved that for one - photon pair production in the high energy limit the ratio of the @xmath184-shell to the k - shell is @xmath185 ( here , @xmath16 denotes the principal quantum number ) .",

    "however , the total pair production rates are substantially lower . unlike before , for the capture into the @xmath92-state",
    "no simple scaling law for the ratio to the ground state can be found .",
    "but whereas the @xmath93-state scales with the same power of the nuclear charge number @xmath18 as the @xmath182-state ( @xmath190 ) , this is no longer true for @xmath92 .",
    "calculations for one - photon pair creation in born - approximation suggest a power of @xmath191 and we find @xmath192 . at @xmath128 the total rate of the @xmath92 is a negligible fraction to the @xmath182 state ( @xmath193 ) but steadily increases to about @xmath194 at @xmath195 .",
