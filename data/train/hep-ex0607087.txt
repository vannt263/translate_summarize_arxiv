    "the branching fractions of all - hadronic decays of the lightest charmed mesons are of interest for several reasons .",
    "the absolute branching fractions of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  mesons serve to normalize other charm meson decays and decay chains through charm quarks . due to the large branching fraction of @xmath6 , charm branching fractions normalize many processes in @xmath7 physics .",
    "inclusive decay rates of charmed mesons to final states including easily - identifiable particles can also be used to disentangle particle content .",
    "hadronic charm decays are also of intrinsic interest in understanding the dynamics of the strong force",
    ". phase shifts between different processes can be probed by measuring the branching fractions of final states that interfere or are related by isospin symmetry .",
    "the cleo - c experiment at the cesr @xmath0 collider has collected 281 pb@xmath8of data at center of mass energy @xmath9  = 3.77 gev and approximately 200 pb@xmath8  with @xmath9  near 4.17 gev .",
    "the 3.77 gev dataset , taken at the peak of the @xmath10 resonance , contains approximately 1 million @xmath11 and 0.8 million @xmath12 events .",
    "the 4.17 gev dataset , taken at an energy that optimizes the production of @xmath13 events with cross section @xmath14 1 nb , is primarily used for studies of @xmath5mesons .    for @xmath3  and @xmath4  mesons at 3.77 gev , and for @xmath5  mesons at 4.17 gev , the production of a charmed meson",
    "is always associated with the production of its antiparticle , as 3.77 gev and 4.17 gev are below the @xmath15 and @xmath16 thresholds , respectively .",
    "reconstruction of `` tag '' @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5  candidates thus provides a clean sample of a known number of decays of the antiparticle and enables powerful methods for measuring absolute branching fractions as detailed below .",
    "analyses of the 3.77 gev data use the kinematic variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 , defined as , and mass and momentum are measured in units of energy . ]",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the energy and momentum of the @xmath23  candidate . for equal - mass particles of mass",
    "@xmath24 produced in a two - body process , @xmath17 will peak at zero , and @xmath18  will peak at @xmath24 with better resolution than the invariant mass .",
    "@xmath23  candidates are required to have @xmath17 consistent with zero within roughly three standard deviations .    for analyses at 4.17 gev , the @xmath18  variable is used along with the invariant mass of the @xmath23  candidate . at this energy @xmath18  functions as a nearly energy - independent proxy for momentum , and separates states produced in different two - body processes .",
    "the @xmath5  produced from @xmath25 decays are boosted slightly relative to the nominal two - body momentum ; the consequent smearing in @xmath18  is accounted for in the selection requirements .",
    "precise measurements of charm meson branching fractions are often made as branching ratios to easy - to - identify and frequent all - hadronic final states , especially @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "uncertainties in these normalizing branching fractions thus propagate to many other modes .",
    "additionally , measurements of decay chains with @xmath23  mesons in the final state usually involve a normalizing @xmath23  decay which must be removed to obtain branching fractions for the intermediate states . reducing the uncertainties in these normalizing modes",
    "is a primary goal of cleo - c . before cleo - c input ,",
    "the relative uncertainties in these branching fractions were about 3% , 6% , and 13% for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively@xcite .    to measure the absolute branching fractions cleo - c uses a technique pioneered by the the mark  iii collaboration@xcite .",
    "single @xmath23candidates are reconstructed , regardless of the rest of the event ; these are called `` single tags '' ( st )",
    ". full reconstruction of a @xmath23@xmath29  pair is also attempted , and candidates are referred to as `` double tags '' ( dt ) .",
    "ratios of st yields to each other give precise branching ratios , while ratios of dt to st yields give information on the absolute branching fractions .",
    "cleo - c measures st yields in three , six , and four decay modes for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5respectively ( separating charge conjugate states ) , and in 9 , 36 , and 15 dt final states for @xmath3@xmath30 , @xmath4@xmath31 , and @xmath5@xmath32  respectively ( one @xmath5@xmath32double tag mode , @xmath33 , is dropped due to continuum background ) .",
    "fits are performed to the observed yields in terms of the total number of produced @xmath23  pairs , @xmath34 , and the branching fraction for each mode@xcite .",
    "the results here are based on 56 pb@xmath8  of 3.77 gev data for @xmath3  and @xmath4and 75 pb@xmath8  of @xmath14 4.17 gev data for @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath3  and @xmath4  results are published in ref .  ; the @xmath5  results are preliminary .",
    "the branching fractions obtained are listed in table  [ tbl : absbfs ] .",
    "1.2 cm    cleo - c does not report a @xmath35 branching fraction .",
    "such events with @xmath36 are included in the @xmath37 branching fraction .",
    "previous experiments have evaluated cuts and efficiencies assuming that all the @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40  signal in the @xmath41 mass region is in fact from the @xmath42 intermediate state .",
    "however there is strong evidence@xcite for a broad scalar contribution underneath the @xmath41 which will contribute differently to a `` @xmath42 '' signal depending on the specific selection requirements chosen , possibly varying up to 10% between measurements .",
    "since cleo - c measurements will soon exceed this level of precision , the need for better - defined reference branching fractions has been recognized .",
    "the long - term solution for precision experiments wishing to use a `` @xmath42 '' signal will be to couple the inclusive @xmath43 branching fraction with monte carlo incorporating dalitz analysis of this decay .",
    "the branching fractions of the cabibbo  suppressed decays of @xmath3  and @xmath4  to multi - pion final states are poorly measured , especially for modes with @xmath44mesons .",
    "knowledge of these branching fractions allows better understanding and simulation of backgrounds to other decays , in particular those involving @xmath45  mesons .",
    "multi - pion decays also give information on intermediate resonant states ( through , _",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . finally , the three decay modes @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 form an isospin triangle that permits the extraction of the phase difference between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 amplitudes ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ) .    in this analysis@xcite , which uses the full 281 pb@xmath8  dataset ,",
    "candidates are reconstructed in seven @xmath3  and five @xmath4  all - pion final states .",
    "vetoes on the invariant mass of @xmath55 and @xmath56 pairs are applied to remove contamination from @xmath45  decays .",
    "branching ratios are obtained relative to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "first observations are made of four inclusive final states and two intermediate states ; limits are placed on the inclusive @xmath57 decay and three intermediate states .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tbl : cabibbosup ] .",
    "the ratio of the two isospin amplitudes for @xmath58 is found to be : @xmath59",
    "the cabibbo  favored ( cf ) decay of a @xmath3  or @xmath4  meson to a state with a neutral kaon includes a @xmath62 .",
    "however there are also doubly - cabibbo  suppressed ( dcs ) decays where the final state instead has a @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath64 amplitude will interfere with the @xmath65 amplitude with the sign of the interference being opposite for the observed states @xmath45  and @xmath66 .",
    "the branching fractions of @xmath23  mesons to @xmath45  and @xmath66should thus in general be different , with an asymmetry of the order of @xmath67 ( enhanced over the dcs rate because this is an interference effect)@xcite .",
    "this will be modified by the unknown phase between the cf and dcs amplitudes in each mode .",
    "cleo - c obtains absolute branching fractions for the process @xmath68 from the full 281 pb@xmath8  sample ( `` @xmath69 '' represents the sum of @xmath45and @xmath66  contributions to a neutral kaon branching fraction ) .",
    "six decay modes are used to find tag @xmath70 candidates .",
    "a pion of the opposite charge , putatively from the @xmath71 decay , is then searched for , and the missing mass squared of the @xmath72 system is computed . a clear peak at the kaon mass squared is seen .",
    "extra peaking contributions are seen from two - body modes with charged pions and muons in the final state , and small smooth backgrounds from three - body modes and combinatoric background are also accounted for , with shapes obtained from monte carlo simulations .    a measurement of @xmath73 can be combined with the directly - measured @xmath74 from table  [ tbl : absbfs ] to obtain an asymmetry .",
    "the analysis yields the following preliminary results : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 no significant asymmetry is observed in this decay mode .",
    "this could result from the phase between the cf and dcs amplitudes being @xmath78 .",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath79 agrees with that obtained from the multi - pion analysis .",
    "because a cabibbo  favored decay of a @xmath5  meson has an @xmath82 quark pair , while cabibbo  favored @xmath3  and @xmath4  decays generally do not , one expects that mesons with large @xmath82 content will be produced more often in @xmath5decay than in @xmath3  and @xmath4  decays .",
    "this difference can be used , for example , to estimate the rate of @xmath83 production at the @xmath84 resonance by exploiting the large @xmath85 branching fraction .",
    "cleo - c has preliminary measurements of inclusive rates of the production of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath41 mesons in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  decays using the full 281 pb@xmath8  dataset at 3.77 gev and 71 pb@xmath8  of 4.17 gev data .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  candidates are reconstructed as tags , and the remaining showers and tracks are used to reconstruct mesons in the @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath36 decay modes .",
    "sidebands in @xmath17 ( for @xmath3  and @xmath4 ) and @xmath18  ( for @xmath5 ) are used to subtract peaking combinatoric backgrounds .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tbl : phietaetap ] .",
    "the @xmath5  branching fractions to these mesons are significantly larger than those for @xmath3  and @xmath4 , as expected .",
    "the cleo - c experiment has recorded 281 pb@xmath8  of @xmath0 collisions at 3.77 gev and 200 pb@xmath8  near 4.17 gev ( of the latter , @xmath14 75 pb@xmath8  is used for the results presented here ) . using these data branching fractions for many decay modes of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  mesons",
    "have been obtained with precision comparable to or exceeding the world average of previous measurements , and the absolute scale of these decays has been established using the unique kinematics of threshold production .",
