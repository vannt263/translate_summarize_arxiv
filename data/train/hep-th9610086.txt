    "since the discovery of black hole radiation by hawking @xcite , the fate of information falling into a black hole has been a mystery .",
    "( see @xcite for reviews . ) if hawking s semiclassical calculation is correct , then the outgoing radiation is purely thermal and the outgoing photons are uncorrelated to each other and to the matter which formed the black hole . if the evaporation is complete , and if the thermal nature of the radiation persists throughout the evaporation , then the original information is lost .",
    "thus if the black hole is formed from a quantum - mechanically pure state , there will nevertheless be a mixed state after the evaporation is complete .",
    "this is the position held by hawking ( e.g. see @xcite ) , but it violates cpt and may lead to difficulties with energy conservation and causality .    if information is not lost in black hole evaporation , there are several possibilities .",
    "one is that the black hole does not evaporate completely , but instead produces one or more planck - scale remnants ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the information disappears into a baby universe @xcite . in this scenario the quantum - mechanical pure state",
    "is preserved , but parts of it are inaccessible to observation .",
    "it is also possible that the radiation is not really thermal , even at early times , because of a complementarity principle @xcite or the inapplicability of the semiclassical approach @xcite , and thus that the information is encoded in subtle correlations in the radiation . in this case",
    "the black hole could act like a normal object with the entropy describing internal degrees of freedom",
    ". some results from string theory @xcite tend to confirm this view .",
    "even if the radiation is thermal and uncorrelated during most of the evaporation , there is no reason to believe that it remains thermal near the endpoint of the evaporation .",
    "the late - time radiation is presumably governed by an unknown theory of quantum gravity , and may well have correlations to the radiation emitted earlier .",
    "however , it is generally believed that late - time radiation can not resolve the information paradox @xcite .",
    "the argument goes as follows : while the black hole is large , it is presumably radiating high - entropy thermal radiation . if the final explosion is to restore a pure state , it must radiate as much entropy as was radiated in earlier times .",
    "however , by the time the black hole reaches the point where unknown physics could come into play , there is little energy remaining . to radiate",
    "a lot of information with little energy requires a long period of time , and thus the `` final explosion '' looks more like a long - lived remnant .",
    "however , wilczek @xcite argues from a moving mirror model that a state with high entropy can nevertheless be purified with arbitrarily low energy cost . in certain ways ,",
    "his model looks more like a remnant theory than a complete - evaporation theory , but it still appears to cast some doubt on the standard argument above .    in any case , this argument requires bounding the entropy that can be contained in a particular region with a fixed energy . in the case of a region with reflecting walls ,",
    "this is the question of finding the thermal state of quantum fields in a box . for a spherical box and a particular field theory",
    "the problem is easily solved . but with a region of complex shape , or where one wishes to make a statement intended to apply to all field theories ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "bekenstein @xcite argues that such a universal bound exists , although unruh and wald @xcite disagree .",
    "here we take a different approach .",
    "we consider only a single scalar field , but we use a weaker and , we hope , more physical condition on the results of the black hole evaporation .",
    "in the end , our results still support the claim that late - time radiation can not restore the purity of the state of an evaporating black hole .",
    "we start by considering a black hole formed from a pure quantum - mechanical state of incoming matter . to avoid any possible complications of quantum gravity theory",
    ", we will look at the state produced after the black hole has completely evaporated @xcite .",
    "gravity should play no significant role in this state , since the energy density state should be small everywhere .",
    "we can describe the final state as follows : at large distances from the position of the black hole ( taken as the origin ) there is outgoing hawking radiation , which we are assuming to be thermal and uncorrelated to anything . within some distance @xmath3 of the origin",
    ", there is some state of ordinary quantum fields that could have correlations with the radiation emitted earlier .",
    "the distance @xmath3 is the distance to which such information might have propagated after unknown physics came into play .",
    "let us assume that hawking s semi - classical calculation is good up to an energy scale @xmath4 .",
    "this temperature is reached when the black hole s mass is ] @xmath5 .",
    "if , after this , the rate of evaporation continues to match the hawking calculation , the black hole will evaporate in time @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the effective number of degrees of freedom in the particles that can be radiated .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "so there is a sphere of radius @xmath8 which contains total energy @xmath9 in which the information could be contained .",
    "[ sec : realistic - er ] taking , for example , @xmath10 and @xmath11 we get diverges as @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the information can be radiated in a small number of particles of about the planck mass , chosen from an infinite spectrum of such particles .",
    "this is effectively a remnant theory . ]",
    "[ eqn : goshwownumbers ] @xmath13    now we would like to answer the following question : how much entropy can be contained in a spherical region of radius @xmath3 with a total energy of @xmath14 ? to answer this question we have to specify what we mean by `` contained in a region '' .",
    "as mentioned earlier , if we ask how much entropy can be contained in a spherical box of radius @xmath3 with perfectly reflecting walls , the question can be easily answered . however , the system with the box is not so closely akin to the system under discussion .",
    "for instance , inserting the reflecting walls into the system produces a divergent increase in the ground - state energy of the system .",
    "furthermore , if we started with the vacuum in the whole system , and then introduced a spherical wall , we would produce a divergent geometric entropy@xcite .",
    "a better description of our system is simply that it has thermal radiation outside radius @xmath3 , and an unknown state of the quantum fields inside radius @xmath3 , but no barrier or boundary at @xmath3 .    to study such systems",
    "we will assume that the difference between the external hawking radiation and an external vacuum is not important to considerations of entropy .",

    "the vacuum - bounded condition allows slightly more entropy .",
    "the entropy difference grows at most logarithmically with the number of thermal wavelengths in the inside region . since the total entropy at a given temperature is linear in @xmath343 , the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath24 goes to zero at high temperatures",

    "we specify a condition on a density matrix describing the state of the overall system .",
    "we require that any measurement which does not look into the inside region can not distinguish our system from the vacuum .",
    "this avoids certain difficulties such as the casimir energy that results from the introduction of a boundary and the geometric entropy @xcite that results from ignoring part of a system . for",
    "these `` vacuum - bounded '' states , we consider the problem of finding the maximum - entropy state for a given total energy .",
    "this is analogous to the problem of finding the thermal state in a system with a rigid boundary .",
    "unfortunately , the vacuum - bounded problem is more difficult than the analogous problem with a rigid boundary and we must resort to working in one dimension and to numerical solution on a lattice . from the numerical solution we justify the ansatz that the continuum wavenumbers are evenly spaced in this problem . using this ansatz we compute an upper bound on the entropy of a vacuum - bounded state , and",
    "show that for high energies ( @xmath362 ) the entropy approaches that of a system with rigid boundaries .",
    "of course this is what one would expect for a system whose typical wavelengths are much shorter than the size of the inside region .    to apply this result to an evaporating black hole we look at the state produced by the black hole after evaporation @xcite .",
    "since our calculation was one - dimensional we must assume that the similarity between the vacuum - bounded state and the thermal state with a rigid boundary extends to 3 dimensions .",
    "then we infer that very little entropy can be emitted in the final explosion , confirming the results of aharonov , casher and nussinov @xcite and preskill @xcite .",
    "for example , a black - hole formed in the big bang with mass of order @xmath363 would be evaporating today . during its life",
    "it would have radiated entropy @xmath364 .",
    "now we assume that the entropy of the final explosion has energy @xmath365 contained in radius @xmath366 as in sec.[sec : realistic - er ] , and that the maximum entropy is not too different from that of a spherical box , in accord with our 1-dimensional result .",
    "then we find that the final explosion can emit only entropy @xmath367 , which is a factor of @xmath368 too little to produce a pure state .",
    "this argument means that either a black hole must not evaporate completely but rather leave a remnant or remnants , that information must be lost , or else that the hawking radiation is not exactly thermal , even at very early times @xcite .",
