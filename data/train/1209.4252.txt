    "spontaneous parity breaking can be naturally explained within the framework of left - right symmetric models ( lrsm ) @xcite which have been considered a novel extension of standard model ( sm ) and studied extensively for last few decades .",
    "also , tiny neutrino masses @xcite can be successfully implemented via seesaw mechanism @xcite without reference to very high scale physics such as grand unification .",
    "incorporating supersymmetry into such models have several other motivations like protecting the scalar sector from quadratic divergences , providing a natural dark matter candidate among others .",
    "however , as studied previously in @xcite , generic supersymmetric left - right models are tightly constrained from consistent cosmology as well as successful gauge coupling unification point of view and in quite a few cases these models do not give rise to successful unification and consistent cosmology simultaneously .",
    "with a view of this , we intend to study non - supersymmetric versions of lrsm and check if both of these constraints can be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "spontaneous breaking of exact discrete symmetries like parity ( which we shall denote as d - parity hereafter ) has got cosmological implications since they lead to frustrated phase transitions leaving behind a network of domain walls ( dw ) .",
    "these domain walls , if not removed will be in conflict with the observed universe @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that planck scale suppressed non - renormalizable operators can be a source of domain wall instability .",
    "gauge structure of the underlying theory dictates the structure of these non - renormalizable operators . in presence of supersymmetry ,",
    "the constraints on the d - parity breaking scale was discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we perform the same analysis in the absence of supersymmetry and also check if successful gauge coupling unification can be achieved simultaneously in these models .",
    "earlier studies on gauge coupling unification in non - supersymmetric lrsm were done in @xcite and very recently in @xcite . here adopt the procedure outlined in @xcite for gauge coupling unification and that in @xcite for domain wall disappearance mechanism to show that in the minimal versions of non - supersymmetric lrsm , successful gauge coupling unification and domain wall disappearance can not be achieved simultaneously .",
    "we then propose two possible extensions of such minimal models which can successfully give rise to both of these desired outcomes .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the formation of domain walls is not generic in all left - right models .",
    "models where d - parity and @xmath0 gauge symmetry are broken at two different stages do not suffer from this problem @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a parity odd singlet field breaks the d - parity first and @xmath0 gauge symmetry gets broken at a later stage by either higgs triplets or higgs doublets .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dw - section ] we briefly review the domain wall dynamics . in section [ minlr ]",
    "we discuss minimal lrsm with higgs doublets and with higgs triplets , and discuss how the requirement of successful disappearance of domain walls gives rise to unphysical constraints on the parity breaking scale . in section [ extlr ]",
    "we discuss two viable extensions of the minimal lrsm which can provide a viable solution to the domain wall problem .",
    "then in section [ gut ] , we study gauge coupling unification in both minimal and extended lrsm and finally summarize our results in section [ conclude ] .",
    "discrete symmetries and their spontaneous breaking are both common instances and desirable in particle physics model building . the spontaneous breaking of such discrete symmetries gives rise to a network of domain walls leaving the accompanying phase transition frustrated @xcite .",
    "the danger of a frustrated phase transition can therefore be evaded if a small explicit breaking of discrete symmetry can be introduced .",
    "if the amount of such discrete symmetry breaking is small , the resulting domain walls may be relatively long lived and can dominate the universe for a sufficiently long time . however",
    ", this will be in conflict with the observed universe and hence these domain walls need to disappear at a very high energy scale ( at least before big bang nucleosynthesis ) . in view of this",
    ", we summarize the three cases of domain wall dynamics discussed in @xcite , one of which originates in radiation dominated ( rd ) universe and destabilized also within the radiation dominated universe .",
    "this scenario was originally proposed by kibble @xcite and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "the second scenario was essentially proposed in @xcite , which consists of the walls originating in a radiation dominated phase , subsequent to which the universe enters a matter dominated ( md ) phase , either due to substantial production of heavy unwanted relics such as moduli , or simply due to a coherent oscillating scalar field .",
    "the third one is a variant of the md model in which the domain walls dominate the universe for a considerable epoch giving rise to a mild inflationary behavior or weak inflation ( wi ) @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the domain walls disappear before they come to dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "when a scalar field @xmath1 acquires a vev at a scale @xmath2 at some critical temperature @xmath3 , a phase transition occurs leading to the formation of domain walls .",
    "the energy density trapped per unit area of such a wall is @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the walls are determined by two quantities , force due to tension @xmath5 and force due to friction @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the average scale of radius of curvature prevailing in the wall complex , @xmath8 is the speed at which the domain wall is navigating through the medium and @xmath9 is the temperature .",
    "the epoch at which these two forces balance each other sets the time scale @xmath10 .",
    "putting all these together leads to the scaling law for the growth of the scale @xmath11 : @xmath12 the energy density of the domain walls goes as @xmath13 . in a radiation dominated era",
    "this @xmath14 is comparable to the energy density of the universe @xmath15 $ ] around time @xmath16 .",
    "the pressure difference arising from small asymmetry on the two sides of the wall competes with the two forces @xmath17 and @xmath18 discussed above . for @xmath19 to exceed either of these two quantities before @xmath20 @xmath21    similar analysis in the matter",
    "dominated era , originally considered in @xcite begins with the assumption that the initially formed wall complex in a phase transition is expected to rapidly relax to a few walls per horizon volume at an epoch characterized by hubble parameter value @xmath22 .",
    "thus the initial energy density of the wall complex is @xmath23 .",
    "this epoch onward the energy density of the universe is assumed to be dominated by heavy relics or an oscillating modulus field and in both the cases the scale factor grows as @xmath24 .",
    "the energy density scales as @xmath25 .",
    "if the domain wall ( dw ) complex remains frustrated , i.e. its energy density contribution @xmath26 , the hubble parameter at the epoch of equality of dw contribution with that of the rest of the matter is given by @xcite @xmath27 assuming that the domain walls start decaying as soon as they dominate the energy density of the universe , which corresponds to a temperature @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , the above equation gives @xmath30 under the assumption that the domain walls are formed at @xmath31 @xmath32 now from eq .",
    "( [ td ] ) @xmath33 demanding @xmath34 leads to @xmath35    the third possibility is the walls dominating the energy density of the universe for a limited epoch which leads to a mild inflation .",
    "this possibility was considered in @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the evolution of energy density of such walls can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scale factor at which domain walls start dominating ( decaying ) and @xmath38 is the corresponding time .",
    "if the epoch of domain wall decay is characterized by temperature @xmath28 , then @xmath39 and the above equation gives @xmath40 in the matter dominated era the energy density of the moduli fields scale as @xmath41 using this in equation ( [ td1 ] ) gives @xmath42 domain walls start dominating the universe after the time of equality , @xmath43 .",
    "so the pressure difference across the walls when they start decaying is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 . replacing the value of @xmath46 from equation ( [ heq ] ) ,",
    "the pressure difference becomes @xmath47 unlike the previous two cases rd and md , here it will not be possible to estimate @xmath28 in terms of other mass scales and we will keep it as undetermined .",
    "we first study left - right symmetric extension of the standard model with only higgs doublets .",
    "in addition to the usual fermions of the standard model , we require the right - handed neutrinos to complete the representations .",
    "one of the important features of the model is that it allows spontaneous parity violation .",
    "the higgs representations then require a bidoublet field , which breaks the electroweak symmetry and gives masses to the fermions .",
    "but the neutrinos can have dirac masses only , which are then expected to be of the order of charged fermion masses . to implement the seesaw mechanism and obtain the observed tiny masses of the standard model neutrinos naturally , one has to introduce fermion triplets to give rise to the so called type iii seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , we shall restrict ourselves to the scalar sector and shall not discuss the implications of such additional fermions .",
    "the particle content of the left - right symmetric model with higgs doublet is @xmath48 @xmath49 where the numbers in the brackets are the quantum numbers corresponding to the gauge group @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to the bi - doublet scalar field @xmath51 , we should also have two doublet fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 to break the left - right symmetry and contribute to the neutrino masses . thus the symmetry breaking pattern becomes @xmath54      in this section we briefly outline left - right symmetric models with different field contents than the one in the previous section .",
    "the usual fermions , including the right - handed neutrinos , belong to the similar representations as in the previous section .",
    "however , the scalar sector now contains triplet higgs scalars in addition to the bidoublet higgs scalar to break the left - right symmetry .",
    "the triplet higgs scalars can then give majorana masses to the standard model neutrinos by the so called type ii seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the particle content of lrsm with higgs triplets is @xmath48 @xmath55 the symmetry breaking pattern in this model remains the same as in the previous model although the structure of neutrino masses changes . in the symmetry breaking pattern",
    ", the scalar @xmath56 now replaces the role of @xmath53 , but otherwise there is no change .",
    "@xmath57      in both the versions of minimal lrsm discussed above , the non zero vev of the right handed doublet ( or triplet ) field breaks both @xmath58 gauge symmetry as well as the discrete left - right parity ( or d parity ) and hence gives rise to transitory domain walls . in this section",
    ", we consider explicit d parity breaking planck suppressed operators in these models by adopting the technique developed in@xcite . and we find constraints on the parity breaking scale by demanding that these planck suppressed operators give rise to successful disappearance of domain walls .    in both the minimal versions of lrsm discussed above , the leading non - renormalizable operator is of dimension six which can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 can either be a higgs doublet or a higgs triplet . assuming a phase where only right type fields get non - zero vev and left type fields get zero vev , the scalar potential up to the leading term in @xmath61 becomes @xmath62 similarly assuming non - zero vev for left type fields only and not for right type fields the effective potential becomes @xmath63 due to the equal chance of both @xmath64 and @xmath65 acquiring the same vev ( guaranteed by the presence of discrete left - right symmetry ) , we consider @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the effective energy difference across the walls separating these two vacua is given by @xmath67 now we shall compare this @xmath19 with the case in a matter dominated era where we have calculated the energy density for the domain wall to disappear .",
    "@xmath68 taking the dimensionless parameters @xmath69 to be of order unity , the above equation gives a lower bound on @xmath2 in a matter dominated era @xmath70 which is unnatural considering the fact that planck scale is the maximum energy scale a physical theory can have .",
    "similarly for radiation dominated era @xmath71 which does not give a bound on @xmath2 .",
    "rather it gives a lower bound @xmath72 .",
    "this is also unnatural since dimensionless couplings are generically taken to be of order one .",
    "thus , in both the versions of minimal lrsm discussed above , the requirement of domain wall disappearance gives rise to unnatural constraints on the scale of parity breaking and the dimensionless parameters .",
    "this drawback of such minimal models appeals for suitable extensions so as to guarantee successful disappearance of cosmologically unwanted domain walls . in this work ,",
    "we propose two such possible extensions as discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we propose two viable as well as minimal extensions of the left right symmetric models discussed above .",
    "we show that , such extensions can give rise to successful disappearance of domain walls and different symmetry breaking patters as well as phenomenology .",
    "consider a gauge singlet field @xmath73 which is even under parity so that the tree level lagrangian is parity symmetric until the @xmath65 field acquires a vev to break ( spontaneously ) parity as well as the @xmath74 gauge symmetry to @xmath75 of standard model .",
    "to study the domain wall disappearance mechanism in this model , we consider planck suppressed higher dimensional operators as in the previous section . unlike before , here we can have dimension five planck suppressed terms in the scalar potential which , as we will see , create sufficient pressure difference across the domain walls to make them disappear .",
    "these operators can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath60 can either be a higgs doublet or a higgs triplet and @xmath77 is the gauge singlet we have introduced . since a singlet like @xmath78 can naturally fit inside several @xmath79 representations , we assume the vev of this singlet field to be of order @xmath80 . assuming a phase where only right type fields get non - zero vev and left type fields get zero vev , the scalar potential up to the leading term in @xmath81 becomes @xmath82 similarly assuming non - zero vev for left type fields only and not for right type fields the effective potential becomes @xmath83 due to the equal chance of both @xmath64 and @xmath65 acquiring the same vev , we consider @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the effective energy difference across the walls separating these two vacua is given by @xmath84 comparing this @xmath19 with the case in a matter dominated era , we have @xmath85 taking the dimensionless parameters @xmath69 to be of order unity , the above equation gives a upper bound on @xmath2 in a matter dominated era @xmath86 similarly for radiation dominated era @xmath87 which gives a similar upper bound on @xmath2 as @xmath88 comparing the obtained @xmath19 with the weak inflation case we have @xmath89 taking the dimensionless coefficients to be of order one , we arrive at the following bound on @xmath2 @xmath90 thus , for @xmath28 of the electroweak scale , @xmath91 .     allows the possibility to have low scale @xmath2 .",

    "as we will see , this extra pair of fields not only provides a viable mechanism for domain wall disappearance , but also allows the possibility to achieve the symmetry breaking @xmath96 at two different stages : @xmath97 where @xmath60 can either be a higgs doublet or a higgs triplet . unlike in the case of minimal lrsm , here we can have dimension five planck suppressed terms in the scalar potential which , as we will see , create sufficient pressure difference across the domain walls to make them disappear . these operators can be written as @xmath98 we denote the vev of @xmath65 as the scale of @xmath99 symmetry breaking @xmath100 and that of @xmath101 as @xmath2 . assuming non - zero vev for only the right handed higgs fields and zero vev for the left handed ones ,",

    ", the gauge coupling unification for minimal lrsm with doublets and triplets are shown in figure [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] respectively .",
    "we show that , just with the minimal field content and no additional fields , successful gauge coupling unification can be achieved only when the parity breaking scale @xmath2 is as high as @xmath128 and @xmath129 for doublet and triplet model respectively . however , if extra pairs of fields @xmath130 are taken into account , the scale of parity breaking @xmath2 can be as low as a few tev s as can be seen from figure [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] . these extra fields",
    "although looks unnatural ( if large in numbers ) , can naturally fit inside @xmath79 representations like @xmath131 .",

    "we consider the evolution and decay of domain walls in two different epochs : radiation dominated as well as matter dominated .",
    "we find that in minimal versions of these models , the successful removal of domain walls put such constraints on the d - parity breaking scale @xmath2 , which are not possible to realize in any physical theory , for example @xmath136 .",

    "a gauge singlet although do not affect the running of gauge coupling , contributes to the effective energy density in such a way that sufficient pressure difference can be created across the domain walls to make them disappear without having some unphysical constraints like @xmath138 as in the case of minimal lrsm .",
    "extension by higgs triplets @xmath139 not only provides a solution to the domain wall problem , but also allows the possibility to have separate @xmath0 and @xmath99 symmetry breaking scales .",

    "however , to agree with the constraints coming from domain wall disappearance ( @xmath140 for tev scale @xmath100 ) , we have to incorporate additional pairs of fields @xmath130 as seen from figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "these extra pairs of fields can naturally fit inside @xmath79 representations like @xmath131 .",
    "the constraints on the scale of parity breaking @xmath2 from domain wall disappearance in this model also depends on the scale of @xmath99 symmetry breaking @xmath100 .",

    "hence suitable extensions of minimal lrsm is required to achieve both domain wall disappearance as well as gauge coupling unification together with the tantalizing possibility of a tev scale intermediate symmetry .",

    "<S> we find that this mechanism can not make the walls disappear in minimal versions of lrsm . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two viable extensions of this model and show that planck scale suppressed operators can give rise to successful disappearance of domain walls provided the scale of parity breaking obeys certain limits . </S>",
    "<S> we also constrain the scale of parity breaking by demanding successful gauge coupling unification and make a comparison of the unification and cosmology bounds . </S>"
