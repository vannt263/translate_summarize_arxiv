    "the hard x - ray emission from luminous seyfert 1 galaxies is often modelled as due to an optically - thin corona above a dense accretion disc .",
    "this model successfully accounts for the reflection component often found in the spectra of these objects ( pounds et al .",
    "the dense optically - thick accretion disc is often assumed to be relatively cold , with iron only weakly ionized ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "sometimes however it may be highly ionized by the irradiating x - rays , resulting in a more complex spectrum ( ross & fabian 1993 ; ycki et al .",
    "1994 ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ; ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ; raska et al .",
    "generally the disc is assumed to be flat .",
    "recent numerical simulations of luminous accretion discs ( turner , stone & sano 2002 ) , particularly when radiation pressure is important , suggest that they are clumpy , irregular and possibly corrugated . in this case , if the corona lies close to the disc , the solid angle subtended by the disc at the corona may be much higher than @xmath0 , the value for a flat disc , and the reflection spectrum itself may be reflected .",
    "this will certainly happen if the disc is corrugated and the corona lies close to the bottom of corrugations .",
    "the observer may then not see any direct emission from the corona but only multiply - scattered flux .",
    "( rapid variability of an agn requires that any such corrugations be on a relatively small spatial scale . )",
    "we attempt here to simulate multiply - scattered reflection spectra for ionized discs in a simple generic manner using the code described by ross & fabian ( 1993 ) .",
    "multiply - scattered reflection spectra have been invoked as one explanation ( fabian et al .",
    "2002 ) for the remarkable spectrum of the narrow line seyfert  1 galaxy 1h  0707495  observed by xmm - newton ( boller et al .",
    ". they might also be relevant if the accretion disc extends well within 6 schwarzschild radii so that returning radiation due to light bending by the strong gravity of the black hole is important ( cunningham 1975 ; martocchia , matt & karas 2002 ) .",
    "multiple reflection is expected naturally if the accretion flow consists of clouds rather than a disc ( e.g. celotti , fabian & rees 1992 ; collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1996 ; malzac 2001 ) .",
    "multiple reflection could also be important in hypernova models for gamma - ray bursts ( mszros 2001 ) , in which the emission is surrounded by ejecta .",
    "we expect that multiple reflection will enhance both broad absorption and emission features in the spectrum , relative to single reflection spectra .",
    "the net effect is to produce a considerably steeper ( softer ) spectrum with pronounced broad spectral features around the k - shell emission of iron and other elements .",
    "as an idealized model , let us consider that the hard continuum originates from close to the bottom of a well or hole . if the opening at the top subtends an effective solid angle @xmath1 as seen from the bottom , then a fraction @xmath2 of the emitted radiation escapes directly ; the rest is scattered , absorbed and reflected by the material in the sides and bottom of the well . to a crude approximation ,",
    "this reflected flux has a similar probability of escaping , with the rest restriking the surfaces within the well .",
    "we model the multiple reflection process by simply introducing a partially reflecting mirror above a flat slab .",
    "a detailed model would involve knowledge of the precise geometry envisaged , but we expect that our simple model will give us a good qualitative guide to what the observer would expect to detect .",
    "if @xmath3 is small , an observer may see only the multiply - reflected flux , and it is this reprocessed radiation only that we discuss .    in detail , we treat a surface layer of gas with hydrogen number density @xmath4 and thomson depth @xmath5 .",
    "the outer surface is illuminated by `` direct '' radiation in the form of a power law with photon index @xmath6 and with total flux @xmath7 ( from 1 ev to 100 kev ) corresponding to a specified ionization parameter @xmath8 the penetration of the illuminating radiation and the compton - thick transfer of the diffuse radiation produced via scattering or emission within the gas are treated as described by ross & fabian ( 1993 ) . at each step in the radiative transfer calculation ,",
    "the diffuse radiation emerging from the outer surface is calculated as described by foster , fabian & ross ( 1986 ) .",
    "only a fraction @xmath3 of this emergent flux , however , is allowed to escape to distant regions .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath9 of the emergent flux is assumed to be reflected back onto the surface , so it is added to the `` direct '' radiation that illuminates the surface .",
    "the transfer calculation proceeds until the radiation field relaxes to a steady state , at which point the portion of the total emergent flux that actually escapes equals the total `` direct '' illumination .",
    "( solid lines ) and from a single reflection ( dotted lines ) for four different values of the ionization parameter @xmath10 .",
    "spectra for different values of @xmath10 have been offset vertically for clarity.,scaledwidth=34.0% ]     renormalized by dividing the escaping flux @xmath11 by the corresponding value at @xmath12  = 8.8  kev .",
    "the solid line is the result for multiple reflection with @xmath13 , while the dotted line is the result for a single reflection ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "bottom : ratio of fake data obtained by simulating the above model for the epic pn ccd for 40  ks ( and intensity appropriate for 1h  0707495 ) to a a power - law model of photon index 2.7.,scaledwidth=34.0% ]",
    "we have calculated multiple - reflection models with direct illumination corresponding to @xmath19 250 , 500 , 1000 and 2000 . for each value of the ionization parameter , models were produced with the emergent radiation having escape fractions of @xmath20 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 and 1.00 . here",
    "@xmath21 corresponds to escape of all emerging radiation with no reflection back onto the surface , and these results are similar to those of ross , fabian & young ( 1999 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the observed spectrum when only 25% of the emergent radiation actually escapes ( and 75% is reflected back ) in comparison with the spectrum without multiple reflection .",
    "multiple reflection reduces the escaping flux for @xmath22 by increasing the probability that such photons will be absorbed before ultimately escaping .",
    "in addition , it changes the _ shape _ of the observed spectrum . to make this clearer ,",
    "figure  2 shows the same two spectra for @xmath23 , but with each spectrum renormalized relative to the corresponding escaping flux at 8.8 kev ( just below the k - edge of fe  xxv ) .",
    "the multiple - reflection spectrum exhibits a relatively deeper fe k - edge , a stronger and broader comptonized fe k@xmath24 line , and a steeper spectrum in soft x - rays ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "an approximate test can be made of the accuracy of our method .",
    "consider a photon energy for which the illuminated material is essentially a pure absorber and coherent scatterer  that is , there is no emission due to absorbed or scattered radiation at other photon energies .",
    "let @xmath26 be the albedo for a single reflection by the material . then , if the probability of escape after each reflection is @xmath3 , the net albedo produced by multiple reflection is @xmath27 fig .",
    "2 shows the results of applying this formula to energies around the k - edge of iron , where it is approximately valid , for @xmath13 .",
    "( 2 ) predicts a slightly deeper absorption feature than our multiple - reflection calculation because it does not take into account incoherent compton scattering of higher - energy photons , which partially fills in the absorption feature ( see ross , weaver & mccray 1978 ) .",
    "figures  3 and  4 provide another way of visualizing the changes that multiple reflection produce in the observed spectrum . in each case , the ratio of the flux escaping after multiple reflections to the flux escaping after a single reflection is shown as a function of photon energy . on average , decreasing the escape fraction @xmath3 decreases the entire spectrum above @xmath28 .",
    "as @xmath3 decreases , however , the broad fe k - absorption feature decreases by a larger amount than the x - ray spectrum as a whole , so that the _ relative _ strength of this feature is enhanced . on the other hand , as @xmath3 decreases , the broad , comptonized fe k@xmath24 emission feature is suppressed less than the x - ray spectrum as a whole , so that this emission feature is also enhanced . at high ionization parameters ( @xmath17 and 1000 ; fig .",
    "4 ) , multiple reflection suppresses the narrow central core of the fe k@xmath24 line , since there is a deep , highly - ionized surface layer that compton scatters line photons that reenter it . at the lowest ionization parameter ( @xmath29 ;",
    "3 ) , a decrease in @xmath3 enhances the fe  xxv line core at 6.7 kev and suppresses the `` neutral '' iron line at 6.4 kev , since multiple reflection increases the effective ionization potential by increasing the total flux incident on the surface . in the soft x - ray region , the overall slope of the ratio presented in fig .  3 or  4 steepens as @xmath3 decreases , indicating that multiple reflection steepens the observed spectrum compared to that resulting from a single reflection .",
    "multiple x - ray reflection creates a steep soft x - ray spectrum and a strong , broad , iron absorption / emission feature .",
    "the power lost from the harder energies above @xmath28 emerges at lower energies , principally in the 0.051  kev band .",
    "overall the spectra resemble those from slightly higher ionization parameters and much higher abundances ( ballantyne , fabian & ross 2002 ) .",
    "a relativistically blurred version of the spectrum for @xmath13 and @xmath17 is shown in figure  5 . that has been used to simulate what would be observed with the xmm - newton epic pn ccd , and this",
    "is also displayed in fig .  5 in the form of a ratio to an incident power - law of photon index 2.7 .",
    "the result compares well to the spectrum of 1h  0707495  found by boller et al .",
    "if we fit the simulated spectrum from 210  kev with a power - law plus a broad gaussian line , then we find that the best - fitting line has a central energy of 4.8  kev , a width of 1.5  kev and an equivalent width of about 6  kev .",
    "positive residuals remain over the 67 kev band .",
    "it is not our intention to carry out a detailed fit to the data of 1h  0707495 , which would require a comprehensive grid of models , but merely to confirm that multiple reflection may be relevant there , as suggested by fabian et al .",
    "since the spectrum of 1h  0707495  is unusual , multiple reflection may occur only occasionally among narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies , and/or the primary continuum may be seen in addition to the reprocessed component most of the time .",
    "multiple reflection can be important when light bending is strong enough to cause part of the reflected spectrum to return to the disk .",
    "this occurs close to the centre of disks around maximally spinning kerr black holes ( martocchia & matt 1996 ; dabrowski et al 1997 ; dabrowski & lasenby 2001 ; martocchia , matt & karas 2002 ) .",
    "strong x - ray reflection has also been invoked ( vietri et al 2001 ; ballantyne & ramirez - ruiz 2001 ) for the production of x - ray lines seen in some gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. piro et al 2000 ) . if the emission is from a funnel geometry ( rees & meszaros 2000 ; mclaughlin et al 2002 ) then the calculations presented here could be relevant .",
    "lower abundances are implied than obtained from single reflection calculations .",
