    "the study of the phase transitions in the nuclear matter under extreme conditions is important for the theoretical analysis of heavy ion collision experiments at the intermediate and high energies  @xcite and for understanding of many critical issues in astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the nuclear multifragmentation observed in intermediate - energy nuclear reactions is indicating the first order phase transition of the nuclear liquid - gas type  @xcite .",
    "this claim is effectively based on the concept of the plateau in the nuclear multifragmentation caloric curve ( the dependence of the temperature @xmath1 on the excitation energy @xmath2 of the system ) which was theoretically predicted in @xcite and later was experimentally found in the @xmath3 mev / nucleon @xmath4 collision  @xcite .",
    "however , in certain experiments , as for example in @xmath5 gev / nucleon @xmath6 collision @xcite and @xmath7 mev / nucleon @xmath8 collisions @xcite , the plateau in the experimental caloric curve is absent .",
    "moreover , although there is a class of statistical multifragmentation models ( smm ) which predicts a plateau ( the discontinuity of energy ) in the caloric curves in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles @xcite , there is yet another class of smm which predicts a plateau in the caloric curves only in the isobaric ensemble and a very smooth transition in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles @xcite .",
    "this particular property of the caloric curves for the first order phase transition in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles can be also seen in the models of other physical systems @xcite .",
    "the first order phase transition in almost all classification schemes has the ehrenfest definition , which is one associated with a finite discontinuity in one or more of the first derivatives of the appropriate thermodynamic potential with respect to its variables of state  @xcite .",
    "the concrete type of the first order phase transition is related to an appropriate potential  @xcite .",
    "for example , for the liquid - gas phase transition the gibbs free energy @xmath0 is relevant and there are discontinuities in its first derivatives , the entropy and the volume , across the temperature - pressure coexistence curve  @xcite .",
    "herewith , the energy in the caloric curve for the liquid - gas phase transition is discontinuous in the isobaric ensemble and it is continuous in the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles .",
    "otherwise , for a magnetic system the free energy @xmath9 is the appropriate potential with the discontinuity in its first derivative , the magnetization , across the temperature - magnetic field coexistence curve  @xcite .",
    "the energy in the caloric curve for the first order phase transition associated with the free energy @xmath9 is discontinuous in the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles , as the first derivative of @xmath9 , the entropy , is discontinuous  @xcite .",
    "some other alternative methods which deal with the occurrence of phase transitions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition , i.e. the first order phase transition associated with the gibbs free energy @xmath0 , usually occurs in the models of the interacting hadron gas such as the relativistic mean - field hadronic model  @xcite , the mean - field approximation with a skyrme effective interaction  @xcite , etc . in spite of the fact that these models have been intensively investigated during a long period of time",
    ", the liquid - gas phase transition in such models has not been studied completely .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this paper is to provide a holistic and concerted approach to tackle the problem of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition on the basis of the method of the thermodynamical potentials and their first derivatives in different statistical ensembles and to establish the general criteria for the liquid - gas phase transition which allow to distinguish it from the first order phase transition associated with the free energy @xmath9 . to determine these criteria we use the well - known rmf hadronic model  @xcite , which enables to find the consistent behavior of the caloric curve and the equation of state ( the discontinuity of the density in the isotherms  @xcite ) for the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition in different statistical ensembles .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ rmf ] ,",
    "we briefly describe basic ingredients of the relativistic mean - field model and the methodology to evaluate the model parameters .",
    "the thermodynamic results for the liquid - gas phase transition and the caloric curve are discussed in sections  [ rez1 ] .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in the final section .",
    "let us consider the relativistic hadron many - body problem in the framework of the local quantum field theory . in the lagrange formalism",
    "this theory is based on the action functional of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the integration measure in four - dimensional minkowski space and @xmath12 is the lagrange density .",
    "we now proceed to use the simplest realization of the rmf approach  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the system of the low - lying baryons interacting through the exchange of the scalar meson @xmath13 and the intermediate abelian @xmath14 gauge boson , i.e. vector meson @xmath15 , is given by  @xcite @xmath16 - m\\overline{\\psi}\\psi   -   \\frac{1}{4 } f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac{1}{2 } m_{v}^{2}a_{\\mu}a^{\\mu } + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi - m_{s}^{2}\\phi^{2})+g_{s}\\phi\\overline{\\psi}\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the isodoublet of the group su(2 ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the spinor fields for protons and neutrons with common mass @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the dirac gamma matrix , @xmath22 is the real isoscalar vector proca field for the @xmath15 meson with mass @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the real isoscalar scalar field for @xmath13 meson with mass @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the antisymmetric field strength tensor for gauge field and the covariant derivative of the group u(1 ) are defined by @xmath27 note that throughout the paper we use the natural units system , @xmath28 .",
    "this lagrangian resembles the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) lagrangian with a massive abelian `` photon '' and an additional scalar interaction .",
    "this theory is renormalizable  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant with respect to the global gauge transformation of the abelian group @xmath14 and the non - abelian group @xmath29 .",
    "but , it is not invariant with respect to the local gauge transformations of these two groups .",
    "the mass term @xmath30 in the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) destroys the local abelian gauge u(1 ) invariance . in order to be invariant with respect to the local gauge transformations of the non - abelian group su(2 )",
    ", the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) must contain an isotopic triplet of massless vector fields interacting with the spinor fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 , because the theory with non - abelian massive gauge fields is not renormalizable .",
    "if that is the case , to preserve the renormalizability of the lagrangian , the mass terms for the non - abelian gauge quanta should be introduced into the theory via the so - called higgs mechanism  @xcite . however , in isospin symmetric matter the long - range part of the nuclear force which comes from one pion exchange and the force mediated by the exchange of the rho meson average to zero .    in the mean - field approximation",
