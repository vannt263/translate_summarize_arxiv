    "consensus and synchronization of node states in a network of coupled dynamics have been extensively studied in the past decades @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that @xcite nodes in a network with suitable connectivity can reach a common state or trajectory where all nodes initial values are encoded with distributed node interactions , and the strong involvement of graph - theoretic approaches has reshaped the study of networked control systems @xcite .",
    "excellent results have been derived towards the understandings of how bidirectional or directed , fixed or switching , deterministic or random , node interactions influence the consensus value and the speed of consensus , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "scientific interest on consensus and synchronization subject to the laws of quantum mechanics has also been noticed .",
    "recent work @xcite introduced the measures of synchronization in quantum systems of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "et al . _ @xcite generalized consensus algorithms to non - commutative spaces and presented convergence results for quantum stochastic maps to a fully mixed state .",
    "_ @xcite made a systematic study of consensus - seeking in quantum networks , where four classes of consensus quantum states based on invariance and symmetry properties were introduced and a quantum gossip algorithm @xcite was proposed for reaching a symmetric consensus state over a quantum network .",
    "the class of quantum gossip algorithms was extended to symmetrization problems in a group - theoretic framework in @xcite .",
    "developments in continuous - time quantum consensus seeking were made in @xcite for markovian quantum dynamics governed by master equations @xcite . in @xcite , using a group - theoretic analysis , the authors proposed a consensus master equation involving permutation operators and showed that a symmetric state consensus can be achieved under such evolutions . in @xcite ,",
    "a graphical method was systematically introduced for building the connection between the quantum consensus dynamics and its classical analogue by splitting the evolution of the entries in the network density operator .",
    "the idea of breaking down large density operators of multiple qubits can in fact be traced back to @xcite using stokes tensors .",
    "a type of quantum synchronization was also shown in the sense that the network trajectory tends to an orbit determined by the network hamiltonian and the symmetrization of the initial state , which implies that all quantum nodes asymptotically reach the same orbit @xcite .",
    "for research on quantum network control and information processing we refer to @xcite ; for a survey for quantum control theory we refer to @xcite .      in this paper , we aim to present a thorough investigation of consensus of qubit ( i.e. , quantum bit ) networks with directed qubit interactions .",
    "the evolution of the quantum network state is given by a lindblad master equation where the lindblad operators are in a set of qubit permutations @xcite .",
    "we define a directed quantum interaction graph associated with each of the permutation operators .",
    "our first contribution is the establishment of an unconditional convergence result indicating that the network state always converges , and the convergence limit is determined by the generating subgroup of the permutations .",
    "this result is proved via the perron - frobenius theory for non - negative matrices , and our analysis also allows for characterization of the convergence speed .",
    "moreover , we establish a tight graphical criterion regarding when such limit admits a consensus in the qubits reduced states .",
    "next , we study the missing symmetry in the reduced - state consensus state , compared to the symmetric consensus state studied in @xcite .",
    "the tool is based on extension of the graph - theoretic methods used in @xcite to the directed case , and the information - flow hierarchy in quantum permutation operators is precisely captured by different layers of information - induced graphs . such a characterization has proven able to establish a clear bridge between quantum and classical consensus dynamics , based on which the full details in the quantum state evolution can be visualized ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we study synchronization of quantum networks with presence of network hamiltonian as well as quantum consensus seeking subject to switching interactions in lights of the previously obtained results .",
    "particularly , we show that the quantum consensus dynamics with switching interactions are by nature equivalent to a parallel cut - balanced classical consensus processes @xcite , and then a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the convergence of the dynamics under switching interactions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] presents some preliminaries including relevant concepts in linear algebra , graph theory and quantum systems .",
    "section  [ secproblem ] introduces the n - qubits network model , its state evolution and the problem of interest .",
    "section  [ secconvergence ] establishes the convergence condition for the considered quantum network .",
    "section  [ secmissing ] turns to a graph - theoretic description of the information hierarchy in the qubit permutations , based on which we obtain a full interpretation of the missing symmetry between reduced - state consensus and symmetric - state consensus .",

    "<S> the state evolution of the quantum network is described by a continuous - time master equation , for which we establish an unconditional convergence result indicating that the network state always converges with the limit determined by the generating subgroup of the permutations making use of the perron - frobenius theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a tight graphical criterion regarding when such limit admits a reduced - state consensus . </S>",
    "<S> further , we provide a clear description to the missing symmetry in the reduced - state consensus from a graphical point of view , where the information - flow hierarchy in quantum permutation operators is characterized by different layers of information - induced graphs . finally , we investigate quantum synchronization in the presence of network hamiltonian , study quantum consensus conditions under switching interactions , and present a few numerical examples illustrating the obtained results .    </S>",
