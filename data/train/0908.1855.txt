    "many biological , social , and economic systems are built and sustained by cooperating individuals  @xcite .",
    "the issue of how cooperation emerges and persists among selfish individuals is the topic of game theory  @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most versatile framework for evolutionary game theory is perhaps the so called symmetric @xmath0 games  @xcite . in such games",
    ", agents can employ two behaviors or strategies  cooperative or defective  in their interaction with others to optimize their fitness .",
    "the goal of this branch of game theory is to establish the conditions for cooperation ( or , equivalently , defection ) to spread .",
    "an important @xmath0 game is the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) that describes the situation when cooperation gives the highest population - level payoff but , in a short timescale , defection maximizes the expected payoff of an individual . in well - mixed populations",
    ", cooperators can not outperform defectors and are doomed to extinction  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , many arguably realistic factors that favor cooperation .",
    "for example , one such factor is space  if the players are embedded in space , allowed only to interact with their neighbors , cooperation can spread in the population  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic explanation for this phenomenon is that cooperators can form spatial clusters where the boundaries , although exploited by defectors , protect the cooperators within  @xcite . on complex networks",
    " scale - free networks in particular  cooperators have a tendency to occupy high degree nodes , which stabilizes cooperation  @xcite . for detailed surveys of this field , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite . from these examples",
    "we learn that the spatial organization , the interaction patterns , are important elements behind the emergence of cooperation .",
    "this raises the question : are there also temporal patterns promoting cooperation ? in a recent work  @xcite , chen and wang investigated the effects of what they call `` payoff aspiration '' ( roughly , the lower limit of the payoff before a player gets impatient changes strategy ) .",
    "they found that intermediate aspiration levels maximize cooperation and argue that too high levels cause too fast strategy changes , while too low levels make the agents not adaptive enough .",
    "these results suggest a more fundamental principle  to achieve cooperation , there might exist an optimal timescale for updating strategies . in the present paper",
    ", we address this hypothesis by studying evolutionary spatial pd games and by explicitly considering the time scales of interaction and selection .",
    "one of our basic assumptions is that the selection timescale is slower than the interaction timescale .",
    "this means that even though each player has a finite lifetime , it can interact many times before selection occurs . during their lifetimes ,",
    "agents do not change their strategies ( or phenotype , in a more biological parlance ) .",
    "how can we connect the payoff of the game to fitness ?",
    "the meaning of payoff is more problem - dependent than fitness  payoff is some result of the interaction that is correlated with reproduction ability  @xcite and often equated , mathematically , with fitness  @xcite .",
    "some works using non - standard relationships between payoff and fitness are ref .",
    "@xcite ( where a background noise is added to the payoff to obtain fitness ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( studying non - linear fitness dependence on payoff ) .",
    "though there are many possible ways to characterize the relationship between payoff and fitness , in our model we assume the two quantities are positively correlated ( like in natural selection ) , and also including an inheritable fitness component ( so called maternal effect  @xcite ) , which can appear due to social , environmental or epigenetic mechanisms .    in the rest of the paper , we first introduce our model , defining the fitness and reproduction time scale .",
    "then we present our numerical and analytic results in detail and relate these to other studies .",
    "in the present study we consider evolutionary games where individuals , located on a two - dimensional square lattice , play pd games with their closest neighbors . following common practice  @xcite , we consider pure strategies without self - interaction ( where one player also plays with oneself  @xcite ) , and use the following parameterization of the pd : if two players both cooperate ( @xmath1 ) then both get a `` reward '' of @xmath2 , two defectors ( @xmath3 ) both obtain the `` punishment '' @xmath4 , a @xmath1 meeting a @xmath3 receives `` the sucker s payoff '' @xmath4 , while @xmath3 acquires `` the temptation to defect '' , @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "for each site @xmath6 we define its fitness at generation @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the generation of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath10 is the instantaneous payoff from the game and the parameter @xmath11 , the _ heritability _ , sets the balance between the present and past payoff gains  the relative importance of a previous generations , or strength of maternal effects  @xcite decays with a factor @xmath12 per time step .      since our main focus is to evaluate how the diversity of reproduction timescale affects the evolution of cooperation , we discard the normal setup that strategy updating of the players is implemented immediately after a round of game  @xcite . instead",
    ", we follow the approach of ref .  @xcite , and assume that the timescale of selection is slower than that of the interaction .",
    "in particular , we update the population by using probabilistic dynamics : for each focal site @xmath6 , a reproduction event occurs with probability @xmath13 , whose magnitude therefore characterizes the timescale of selection .",
    "when @xmath13 is close to unity , selection is frequent , while for small values of @xmath13 the reproduction event is rare and natural selection is slow .",
    "it is easy to see that the average time of selection on each site is @xmath14 . by this simple way",
    ", we are also able to introduce diversity of reproduction timescales .    when strategies are updated , the focal player @xmath6 and one randomly selected neighbor , say @xmath15 , compete for creating an offspring at @xmath6 . the focal site will , depending on their fitnesses , be occupied by either the offspring of @xmath6 or @xmath15 .",
    "to be specific , the neighbor @xmath15 places a new offspring with the same strategy on the focal site @xmath6 with a probability @xmath16}},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 measures the probabilistic selection intensity ( or noise , or temperature ) ; otherwise @xmath6 is replaced with an offspring of the previous individual at @xmath6 .",
    "a newborn is assigned the initial fitness @xmath18 ( the precise value of @xmath19 does not affect our conclusions ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the individuals sometimes can start with new strategies taken from a neighbor with higher fitness than the individual .",
    "the noise parameter @xmath17 is known to have a nontrivial effect on the evolutionary trajectories  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the highest cooperation levels appear in moderate amounts of noise .",
    "( here we want to point out such optimal behavior of noise in promoting cooperation is not universal , but dependent on the topology of the connectivity structure . ) furthermore , in a very recent paper  @xcite , szab _ et al .",
    "_ reported an interesting result that the darwinian selection of  temperature \" favors values of @xmath17 close to @xmath20 which is related to the optimum providing the highest level of cooperation . in this paper",
    "we will not investigate the effects of @xmath17 further , but set @xmath17 to a value , @xmath21 , that is low enough for the effects of the game to dominate the effects of noise , and high enough for selection to occur .",
    "we investigate our model with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "all runs are on a @xmath22 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "initially , either a cooperator or a defector , randomly chosen with equal probability , occupies each site . during one mc sweep we go through all players once in a random order .",
    "the key observable is the average fraction @xmath23 of cooperators in the population in the stationary state , which is measured for the last @xmath24 sweeps of the total simulation time @xmath25 .",
    "the results presented below are averages over twenty realizations from independent initial configurations .     of cooperation as a function of @xmath26 for different values of @xmath12 . in ( a ) and ( b ) the individuals have reproduction rate @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . ]",
    "we start by investigating how the heritability @xmath12 affects the evolution of cooperation .",
    "the simulation results for @xmath23 as a function of @xmath26 for three values of @xmath12 and two values of @xmath13 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in general",
    ", we can observe that with an increasing @xmath12 , the average fraction of cooperation grows .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath12 , the system can even , for the weakest temptations to defect , reach the absorbing state of full cooperation .",
    "this means that , the ability of inheritance of fitness from previous generations has a positive impact on the emergence of cooperation .",
    "the larger @xmath12 is , the greater is the cooperation level .",
    "this result is somewhat expected since other studies have shown that the average payoff of @xmath1 in the equilibrium is greater than that of @xmath3  @xcite .     of cooperators as a function of @xmath26 for different values of @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is fixed to @xmath29 . ]    even if the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath23 is qualitatively expected , it is rather different for the two @xmath13-values of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we fix @xmath30 and study how the average fraction of cooperation evolves as @xmath13 changes . for large ( @xmath31 ) and small ( @xmath32 ) values",
    "@xmath23 is smaller than for @xmath27 .",
    "this result suggests that a moderate reproduction rate promotes the spread of cooperation . to make this point clearer , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we summarize the results of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath13 for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "as surmised , the highest cooperation level is achieved in a region where @xmath13 is moderate , resembling coherence resonance phenomenon  that @xmath13 alone ( without e.g.  any weak periodic force ) can promote cooperation , as has been found frequently in recent literatures  @xcite .",
    "for example , by introducing additive noise to the payoff matrix of the pd game , perc found that cooperation is maximized at a moderate variance of payoff variations  @xcite . along a different research line , ren _",
    "et al . _",
    "studied pd game on random regular graphs and found that there exists an optimal amount of topological randomness , leading to the highest level of cooperation  @xcite . going back to our study ,",
    "note that the optimal value @xmath33 , where @xmath23 is maximized , depends on the value @xmath12 . increasing",
    "@xmath12 will shift @xmath33 toward smaller values ( smaller reproduction rates ) .",
    "for instance , for @xmath34 we have @xmath35 , while for @xmath30 @xmath33 is about @xmath36 .",
    "this point is also reflected by figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , where given @xmath30 the curves for @xmath27 take the rightmost position .     as a function of reproduction rate @xmath13 for @xmath37 .",
    "the squares , circles , and triangles correspond to @xmath34 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively . ]",
    "the nontrivial behavior of @xmath23 in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and  [ fig3 ] can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "as @xmath38  selection happens frequently ; the average fitness of @xmath1 should be lower than that of @xmath3 ( due to the frequent exploitation on @xmath1 by @xmath3 ) , so @xmath23 will decrease . on the other hand , in case of @xmath39  selection is very slow ; defectors around the boundary have enough time to obtain a fitness high enough to outcompete the cooperators .",
    "this is reminiscent of the observation that the formation of @xmath1-clusters can protect cooperation in the spatial pd , whereas the clusters of @xmath3 would deteriorate their own environment  @xcite . in the light of this",
    ", the maximal cooperation levels are reached for @xmath13-values that are neither be too large nor too small , so that @xmath1 has a larger chance than @xmath3 to obtain high fitness . in order to investigate this hypothesis further , we will first check what will happen if the population is well mixed rather than two - dimensionally extended .",
    "though mean - field treatment is not appropriate for spatial case , it is a fair first - order approximation of the well - mixed case .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that the average coordination number ( number of interactions per site , per mc sweep ) is @xmath40 . in the mean - field approximation",
    "we can write the following equation for the evolution of the average fraction of cooperation :    @xmath41}- \\frac{1}{1+\\exp    [ ( \\overline{f}_c-\\overline{f}_d)/\\kappa ] } \\big)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -f_c(1-f_c)\\tanh{\\big(\\frac{\\overline{f}_d-\\overline{f}_c }    { 2\\kappa}\\big)}\\label{fc},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 denote the average fitness of @xmath1 and @xmath3 . the sign of @xmath43 determines whether @xmath23 converges to @xmath2 , @xmath4 , or remains unchanged . since each individual reproduces with probability @xmath13 , the average reproduction period is @xmath44 where @xmath45 represent the smallest integer larger than the argument .",
    "the average fitness of @xmath3 at age @xmath7 can be written as @xmath46 .",
    "assume the age of the individuals are equally distributed in the region @xmath47 $ ] , using the boundary condition @xmath48 , we obtain the average expected fitness of @xmath3 : @xmath49 .",
    "after some algebra , we get    @xmath50    we can see that for any @xmath51 , because @xmath52 , @xmath23 will go to zero .",
    "the incorporation of spatial effects or diversity of reproduction times will change this picture .",
    "the permission of only nearest - neighbor interaction , and non - synchronous reproduction , also assures the possibility of @xmath53 at a local spatial scale .",
    "another factor is that @xmath3 clusters `` defeat themselves ''  @xcite . in combination with these observations ,",
    "the intrinsic stochasticity of probabilistic reproduction gives @xmath1 a chance to outcompete @xmath3 for dispersion , given that @xmath13 is appropriately selected . as a consequence ,",
    "cooperators are favored by diversity of reproduction , and can even dominate the whole population provided that @xmath26 is sufficiently small .      in reality",
    "there is a spread in reproduction times .",
    "we proceed to investigate the effects of diversity on our pd model . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to a bimodal distribution of @xmath13-values : we assign @xmath27 to a fraction @xmath54 of the players and @xmath31 to the rest .     as a function of @xmath26 for different systems where fraction @xmath54 of population has reproduction rate @xmath20 , and the others have @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is set to @xmath29 . ]     of cooperators as a function of @xmath26 for three special cases where all players have a reproduction rate @xmath55 ( squares ) , @xmath56 ( circles ) , and @xmath57 individuals with @xmath27 and the remaining with @xmath31 ( triangles ) .",
    "note that the population with half @xmath27 and half @xmath31 have the same average reproduction rate as the population with @xmath55 , and the same average life span as the population with @xmath56 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath26 for @xmath30 and different values of @xmath54 .",
    "we find that for appropriate mixing of the two types of individuals , for instance @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the final cooperative level is further enhanced as compared to a monomorphic population ( @xmath60 or @xmath2 ) . to investigate this further , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we graph @xmath61 for three systems : one with a polymorphic population where half of the population has @xmath27 the other has @xmath31 , another with a monomorphic population of the same average reproduction rate @xmath55 as the polymorphic population , and a third monomorphic population with the same average life time as the polymorphic population ( giving @xmath56 ) . in this comparison , the polymorphic population has a higher cooperation level than both the monomorphic reference populations .     for different values of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath60 or @xmath2 represent monomorphic populations ; diversity ( measured in standard deviation ) is largest for @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath12 is set to parameter @xmath29 . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we also note that an intermediate mixing of reproduction rate of the population benefits the maintenance of cooperation .",
    "this finding is corroborated by fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where @xmath63 is displayed for various @xmath26-values .",
    "for small @xmath26 , @xmath23 can reach unity even for moderate values of @xmath54 . with an increasing temptation to defect , the region of @xmath54 with non - zero cooperation vanishes . despite this ,",

    "the enhancement of cooperation at intermediate levels of mixing of two types of individuals can be explained in the same vein as ref .",
    "@xcite , where szolnoki and szab studied evolutionary pd game with a fraction @xmath54 of players having higher influence to spread their strategies than the others .",
    "they found that highest level of cooperation is attained when @xmath54 is around @xmath28 .",
    "their interpretation was that the less influential individuals act as followers  @xcite which stabilizes cooperation . in our case , by analogy",
    ", we can assume individuals with high reproduction ( large @xmath13 ) act as followers  @xcite , since , on average , they always get lower fitness than those with slow reproduction rate .",

    "note that the range of @xmath26 extends to values lower than 1 , where the game is not a proper prisoner s dilemma . ]",
    "to further investigate how the difference of reproduction rate affects the evolution of cooperation ; we measure the @xmath54-dependence of extinction threshold of @xmath65 and @xmath66  the values of @xmath26 that demarcate the region of coexisting cooperators and defectors .",
    "the simulation results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . between the upper and lower critical points @xmath1 and @xmath3 can coexist . above ( below ) this region",
    "only defectors ( cooperators ) remain alive in the final stationary states .",
    "note that , for the sake of comparison , we extend the @xmath26-values to the region smaller than @xmath2 where the game is a stag - hunt game rather than a pd  @xcite . from this figure",
    ", we observe that for intermediate @xmath54 both @xmath65 and @xmath66 attain their maximum values , though not at the same @xmath54 .",
    "to summarize , in the present work we have proposed and analyzed an evolutionary , spatial prisoner s dilemma game including a partial inheritance of fitness , a probabilistic reproduction , and a diversity of reproduction rates .",
    "the combination of these factors gives rise to rich dynamic behavior of the system .",
    "in particular , the stronger the ability of inheritance of fitness is , the more cooperation is there .",
    "the reproduction rate has a nontrivial effect on the evolution of cooperation .",
    "when the parameter @xmath12 ( characterizing the strength of inheritance of fitness ) is fixed , the highest cooperation level is realized for moderate reproduction rates .",
    "both too slow and too fast reproduction rates can harm cooperation .",
    "moreover , we find that the presence of diversity of reproduction rate can enhance cooperation . the behavior of promoting cooperation is found to resemble coherence resonance .",
    "these findings suggest that the heterogeneity of individual traits might benefit cooperation in pd situation , giving another clue to the emergence of population in social and biological systems of selfish individuals .    in a recent work ,",
    "qin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite explored the effects of infinite memory in a spatial pd game ( allowing self - interaction ) .",
    "they found that with a moderate memory effect , the extinction threshold @xmath65 reaches a maximal value , but observed no such behavior for @xmath66 .",
    "their memory mechanism is similar to the maternal - effect fitness inheritance in our model . in another related work",
    "@xcite , roca _ _ et al.__considered independent interaction and selection timescales in evolutionary games .",
    "the authors studied all @xmath67 nonequivalent symmetric @xmath0 games , and found that , depending on the type of the game , rapid selection may lead to changes of the asymptotic equilibria and changes in the basins of attraction  @xcite .",
    "@xcite differs from ours in the approach to strategy updates  they model updates as a moran process , whereas we use a stochastic migration rule ; and in the interaction configuration they , in contrast to us , consider a non - spatial ( or well - mixed ) population .",
    "one future problem is how cooperators vanish as the temptation to defect increases . for evolutionary pd with stochastic imitation rules szab and tke",
    "@xcite found a phase transition of the directed percolation universality class  @xcite .",
    "we expect a similar transition can occur in our model in the case of large value of @xmath13 .",
    "however , this point needs to be confirmed in further studies .",
    "moreover , how the @xmath13-value maximizing @xmath23 depends on the parameter @xmath12 is not addressed in the present work .",
