    "the reaction @xmath0 has attracted much interest lately , as a means to investigate the properties of correlated @xmath2 pion pairs , the `` @xmath3 '' meson , in nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "this has been partly motivated by recent experimental results , which show an @xmath4 dependent large enhancement of the cross section at low invariant masses of the dipion system @xcite .",
    "the enhancement occurs for the @xmath5 process ( @xmath6 and 2 at low energies ) , but is conspicuously absent for the @xmath7 case ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus , it happens only when @xmath6 pion pairs are produced , and could be related to the medium dependence of the @xmath1 interaction in the @xmath3 channel .",
    "our theoretical understanding of the @xmath1 scattering in vacuum has improved considerably in the last few years .",
    "close to threshold , the @xmath1 interaction is well described by chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath9pt ) . at higher energies , where unitarity matters and we are out of the @xmath9pt range of validity , some very successful non perturbative models have been developed@xcite .",
    "they are able to give a good description of the @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath3 channel up to energies above 1 gev .",
    "whereas in vacuum the low energy @xmath1 interaction in the @xmath2 channel , although attractive , is too weak to admit a bound state , it was soon realized that the nuclear medium attraction of the pions could lead to the accumulation of some strength close to the two pion threshold , or even to the appearance of a new bound state@xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached in ref.@xcite , where an enhancement of the the spectral function in the @xmath3 channel , just above the @xmath10 threshold , has been predicted as a consequence of a possible partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium . actually , in more detailed calculations , based on the @xmath1 interaction model of ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that spontaneous s - wave pion pair condensation could appear at densities as low as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "further works along the same line , but using the chirally improved jlich model for the meson - meson interaction , have shown that instabilities are pushed up in density when chiral constraints are imposed @xcite . nonetheless , some accumulation of strength close to the two pion threshold was found .",
    "similar results have been obtained in ref .",
    "the latter work is based in the model for @xmath1 interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite , which generates the scattering amplitude using the chiral lagrangians , and then unitarizes it by the inverse amplitude method .",
    "the first experimental signals showing a small enhancement of the @xmath1 spectral function in the @xmath12 reaction were found in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the experiment did nt measure below @xmath13 mev , and hence , missed the most interesting region .",
    "the advent of chaos improved considerably the experimental possibilities , and it has provided us with a wealth of good quality data for several charge channels and nuclei .",
    "the results show the emergence of a very clear peak in the @xmath14 spectral function close to threshold , when pions in the scalar isoscalar channels are present in the final state @xcite .",
    "this peak , absent for the reaction on deuterium already appears on light nuclei , and grows as a function of the atomic number .",
    "in contrast , only minor changes are observed when the cross section of the @xmath15 reaction in deuterium is compared to the same process in heavier nuclei .",
    "certainly , the different behaviour of the two processes can not be caused by trivial nuclear effects , like fermi motion , pauli blocking , or pion absorption , which are practically identical for both cases .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a calculation of the @xmath12 reaction has been presented in which the @xmath1 fsi was taken into account using the approach of ref .",
    "the emphasis being placed on the analysis of fsi , the elementary mechanism of pion production on a single nucleon ( @xmath16 ) was described in a simplified manner , taking only the most important pieces of the amplitude . also , some simplifications were done on the treatment of nuclear effects , like fermi motion , or pion absorption .",
    "the results are very stimulating , and show some enhancement on the @xmath14 distribution close to threshold , which agrees well with the experimental data .    our aim in this paper is to do a more detailed study of the reaction , including a realistic @xmath16 amplitude , and incorporating some nuclear effects omitted in the previous work , and which could affect its conclusions .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : chiang ] we give a brief outline of the model for @xmath1 scattering in the scalar isoscalar channel both in vacuum @xcite and in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : pin ] we develop a model for the @xmath16 reaction . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : nuc ] we discuss the process in nuclei .",
    "the @xmath1 scattering amplitude is calculated solving the coupled channels bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xmath17 where the subindex @xmath18 corresponds to the state @xmath19 and the subindex @xmath20 accounts for the @xmath19 and the @xmath21 states .",
    "the potentials @xmath22 are obtained from the lowest order chiral lagrangians@xcite .",
    "explicit expressions can be found in ref .",
    "the @xmath23 term of eq .",
    "[ eq : ls ] stands for @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the momenta of the mesons as defined in fig .  [",
    "fig : ls ] . a cutoff ( @xmath27 gev ) is used in the evaluation of the integral .",
    "@xmath28 is the product of the two meson propagators in the loop , @xmath29 the particular @xmath22 off - shell dependence leads to the simplification of the integral bs equation which can be transformed into the purely algebraic expression @xmath30 where @xmath31 is now the on - shell part of the potentials ( when the momenta are taken such that @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 the resulting amplitude reproduces well experimental phase shifts and inelasticities in the @xmath2 channel up to @xmath34 gev .      in the nuclear medium , the pion propagators",
    "are strongly modified , mainly due to their coupling to particle - hole @xmath35 and @xmath36hole @xmath37 excitations .",
    "therefore , new terms , of the type depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsn ] have to be included in the calculation of the scattering amplitude .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the terms c),d),f ) , ... of fig .  [",
    "fig : lsn ] cancel the off shell contribution of the terms a),b),e ) , ... so that only these latter terms must be considered with the @xmath1 amplitudes factorized on shell . as a result",
    "the new bs equation is written as @xmath38 as the @xmath39 state contributes very little to @xmath40 at low energies , the vacuum values are kept for @xmath41 . only @xmath40 and @xmath42 are renormalized in the medium .",
    "the function @xmath42 is now given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the pion selfenergy in the nuclear medium calculated as @xmath45 with @xmath46 the landau - migdal parameter ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 the @xmath49 coupling constant ( @xmath50 ) , and @xmath51 the lindhard function for both @xmath52 and @xmath53 excitations@xcite .",
    "in addition , we have also included the contribution of @xmath54 excitations as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : imt ] we show the imaginary part of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude for several nuclear densities .",
    "the results show a displacement of strength towards low energies .",
    "although eq .",
    "[ eq : lsn ] leads to a zero value for the amplitude close to the adler s zero , ( @xmath55 with @xmath56 the mandelstam variable of the two pions system ) , the accumulation of strength close and below the two pion threshold is large and grows rapidly as a function of the nuclear density .",
    "very similar results were found in other works using different models for @xmath1 interaction but imposing some minimal chiral constraints .",
    "see , for instance , fig .",
    "12 of ref . @xcite and fig . 3 of ref",
    "our understanding of the @xmath57 reaction at low energies has improved considerably in the last few years both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the model we present here follows closely that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the @xmath58 process was calculated . in this paper",
    "we will extend it to other charge channels and will include additional mechanisms , that have been found to be important in the calculation of some differential cross sections@xcite .    at low energies ,",
    "the only particles that need to be considered are pions , nucleons , and the @xmath59 and roper resonances .",
    "the need of the latter seems surprising , because of its relatively high mass and the smallness of the @xmath60 coupling .",
    "however , the roper resonance partly decays to a nucleon and a s - wave pion pair .",
    "this mechanism does not vanish at threshold , unlike most other terms , and it has been found to be very important for all charge channels that allow for an i = j=0 pion pair@xcite .    we have considered in our model the mechanisms represented by the diagrams of fig . [",
    "fig : dia ] .",
    "the dashed lines are pions , and the internal solid lines are all possible baryons ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "notice , that different charge channels allow or forbid some of the diagrams .",
    "also all possible different time orderings , not explicitly depicted , are included in the actual calculation .",
    "the feynman rules used to calculate the scattering amplitude are derived from the effective lagrangians of the appendix .",
    "it is relevant to mention here that no attempt to fit the @xmath57 data has been made .",
    "rather , standard values for the coupling constants , obtained from different experiments and/or analysis , have been used .",
    "the scattering amplitudes for the different @xmath62 charge channels can be written as linear combinations of four isospin amplitudes @xmath63 .",
    "here , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total isospin of the system and the isospin of the two final pions .",
    "the expressions , for the channels we are interested in , are @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 before proceeding , it is interesting to make some qualitative considerations .",
    "the symmetry of the pion pair wave function implies that the orbital angular momentum of the two final state pions will be even for the @xmath69 and odd for the @xmath70 amplitudes .",
    "thus , at low enough energies , where only s - wave would dominate , both @xmath71 and @xmath72 should be negligible .",
    "on the other hand , the cross section for the @xmath73 channel is much smaller than for the other two cases .",
    "therefore @xmath74 , what implies that the amplitudes for the @xmath75 and for the @xmath76 case should be equal at low energies and also that they are , essentially , dominated by the production of scalar isoscalar pion pairs . as a consequence , the @xmath76 cross section should be about one half the one for @xmath75 , once the different thresholds are taken into account . of course , the energies at which there are experimental data are not that close to threshold and one can not neglect @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in our calculation , we will proceed as follows .",
    "first , using the lagrangians of the appendix we calculate the amplitudes for the different charge channels .",
    "then , by means of eqs .",
    "[ eq : pm ] , [ eq:00 ] and [ eq : pp ] , we obtain @xmath69 , and the combination @xmath77 , and finally , we modify @xmath78 by including the final state interaction of the @xmath2 pion pairs .    at low energies , due to the smallness of the @xmath70 contributions ,",
    "we only need to consider the effects of the fsi on the @xmath79 channels . furthermore , as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath1 interaction in for @xmath8 is quite weak and does not change appreciably inside the nuclear medium .",
    "thus only the fsi on the @xmath6 channel could produce large effects on the scattering amplitude both in vacuum and in nuclei . to account for it ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath78 is modified in the following manner , @xmath80 where @xmath42 and @xmath40 are the two pions propagator and the scalar isoscalar two pions amplitude defined in eqs .",
    "[ eq : prp ] and [ eq : lsn ] respectively . using again eqs .",
    "[ eq : pm ] , [ eq:00 ] and [ eq : pp ] , where @xmath78 is now replaced by @xmath81 we obtain the scattering amplitudes for the physical channels .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : crs ] , this model , without free parameters , reproduces fairly well the total cross sections for the three channels considered .",
    "this agreement extends to differential cross sections , as it will be shown for some cases in next section .",
    "the net effect of the inclusion of the pions fsi is a small enhancement of the total cross section for the @xmath75 and @xmath76 channels , and slight modifications of the differential cross sections , as it was expected , given that the @xmath82 factor changes very smoothly , in vacuum , over the available phase space .",
    "there are several nuclear effects that could modify he pion production cross section , like fermi motion , pauli blocking , pion absorption and quasielastic scattering .",
    "additionally , there could be new reaction mechanisms involving more than one nucleon , but the contribution of this kind of processes has been shown to be quite small @xcite . to account for the medium effects we follow ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming only one nucleon mechanisms , the cross section can be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are the initial pion , initial nucleon and two final pions momenta ; @xmath87 and @xmath88 are their energies . the spatial volume element is written in terms of @xmath89 , perpendicular , and @xmath90 parallel to the beam momentum .",
    "the occupation number @xmath91 refers to the local density , it takes the value 1 when the argument is below the local fermi momentum ( @xmath92 ) and zero above it .",
    "note the sum over initial and final spins , but not over isospin because the channels we study involve only protons in the initial state and neutrons in the final one . in this paper",
    ", we only consider symmetric nuclei , and we will use the same density for neutrons and protons .",
    "the nuclear densities are taken from ref .",
    "the amplitude @xmath93 is also evaluated at the local density , what fundamentally means that its only changes occur in the @xmath82 factor , related to the @xmath1 interaction . finally ,",
    "the factors @xmath94 , and @xmath95 account for the flux loss due to pion absorption and scattering in the case of @xmath94 and for pion absorption alone in the case of @xmath95 . both pion absorption and quasielastic scattering",
    "are quite strong at the energy of the incoming pion and both reduce the effective initial pion flux .",
    "that is clear for the absorption , but it is also true for the @xmath18-nucleus quasielastic scattering , because in these collisions the pion loses always some energy , what reduces enormously the possibility of a subsequent pion production .",
    "we implement the flux lost with the eikonal factor @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the absorption and quasielastic scattering probability per unit length , that we take from ref . @xcite . due to these interactions ,",
    "the flux reaching the inner nucleus is quite small and the reaction happens at the surface , what reduces considerably the possibility of strong medium effects . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the final pions have low energy and absorption or quasielastic scattering is a minor effect in their case .",
    "this has also been confirmed in the analysis of experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite . nonetheless , it could affect more those events happening at high densities in the center of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , we include the factor @xmath98 that calculates the reduction of the cross section due to the absorption of any of the final pions .",
    "it is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 are the elements of longitude along the @xmath101 and @xmath102 directions .",
    "the probability of quasielastic collisions is very small at these energies and we ignore it .",
    "the results that will be presented in this section are all compared with chaos data .",
    "we have approximately implemented the experimental acceptance cuts in our calculation .",
    "let us take the beam direction as the @xmath103axis , and @xmath104 forming with @xmath90 the horizontal plane , then @xmath105 degrees , where @xmath106 is the pion angle with the @xmath107 plane , and @xmath108 , with @xmath109 the pion angle with the @xmath90 direction .",
    "also , we have taken a pion kinetic energy threshold , @xmath110 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deu ] , we show the invariant mass distributions for the deuteron case . we obtain a quite good agreement in the @xmath111 channel in both shape and size .",
    "the agreement is not as satisfactory for the @xmath75 case . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : crs ] , the total cross section is slightly overestimated by our model , and a similar situation is found for the mass distribution . in order to compare easily with the experimental shape , we have renormalized our result reducing it by a 20% and this is what is shown in the figure .",
    "let us remember here , that no parameter has been adjusted , and some of them , like those related to the roper properties are very uncertain .",
    "a quite small change of a few percent in the roper coupling constants would produce a fine agreement in size .",
    "it is interesting to understand the quite different behaviour of the two channels under consideration . as it was already stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath111 case follows closely a pure phase space distribution .",
    "the two peaks of the figure respond only to the geometry of the experimental apparatus , which favours clearly the situations in which either the pions go together ( low @xmath14 ) or in opposite directions ( high @xmath14 ) .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath14 distribution in the @xmath75 reaction reflects the much richer structure of the amplitude , and it is produced by the destructive interference of large pieces .",
    "consider , as an example , the mechanisms ( i ) @xmath112 and ( ii ) @xmath113 .",
    "the ( i ) amplitude has a constant sign , all over the available phase space . however , process ( ii ) has an amplitude approximately proportional to the scalar product of the final pions momenta .",
    "therefore , it changes sign when passing from low to high invariant masses .",
    "in fact , not only is there destructive interference at low masses , the constructive interference increases the size of the high mass region .",
    "our results for calcium are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cal ] .",
    "again , there is a very good agreement with the @xmath111 data .",
    "the shape of the figure is quite similar to the deuteron case .",
    "there is some softening , and the distribution reaches higher masses .",
    "both features are mostly due to the fermi motion of nucleons .",
    "pion absorption is weak at low energies .",
    "hence , it does not affect much the final pions , although it is partly responsible for the reduction of the spectral function at high masses .",
    "more important is the initial pion absorption , which apart from changing the total cross section , prevents the pions from reaching the nucleus core , therefore decreasing the effective density at which the reaction happens , and modulating all nuclear effects .",
    "the quality of the agreement on the latter channel , gives us confidence that all standard nuclear effects are properly taken into account .",
    "in particular that we have a proper description of where in the nucleus the reaction takes place .",
    "finally , let us discuss the @xmath75 data , the channel in which the nuclear dependent @xmath1 interaction in the scalar isoscalar channel could be responsible of the presence of a low mass peak .",
    "our results show some enhancement close to threshold , even when the pion fsi is calculated in vacuum .",
    "this is due to fermi motion . in the full calculation",
    ", the inclusion of the medium dependence in the fsi leads to a further enhancement and a displacement towards low masses , although is not enough to reproduce the data .",
    "one first question is the consistency of our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which reproduce well the experiment . in order to do a proper comparison",
    ", we should impose some approximations that were used there .",
    "in particular , we find that pion absorption forces the reaction to occur at the nuclear surface , at densities lower than those used in ref .",
    "if we impose a high fixed average density ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cal2 ] ) , we also get a large , although insufficient enhancement , and too high values for the mass distribution at high masses , produced by the excess of fermi motion .",
    "if we neglect pion absorption , the results follow closely the curve corresponding to @xmath114 , as expected , given the fact that for the calcium nucleus , the average density is approximately half the nuclear density .    in order to facilitate further the comparison with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we have also considered a simplified model for the reaction , neglecting all terms with a @xmath59 resonance .",
    "the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : cal4 ] correspond to fsi calculated in vacuum and with a density @xmath114 .",
    "this simplified model has a similar structure to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and although it is able to reproduce the peaks structure in nuclei , it does so at the price of overestimating for the deuteron case the threshold region by a large factor .",
    "we have studied the @xmath115 reactions on the deuteron and on calcium using a realistic model for the elementary @xmath116 production , and including several nuclear medium effects , like fermi motion , pion absorption , pion quasielastic scattering , and the medium dependent @xmath1 interaction in the scalar isoscalar channel .",
    "we find a very good agreement with the experimental data for the @xmath111 production , which gives us confidence on our treatment of the common nuclear effects .",
    "however , we are unable to reproduce fully the strong enhancement close to the two pion threshold found in the experiment for the @xmath75 production .",
    "we also find that approximations previously used in the literature could be critical in reproducing such an enhancement .",
    "several possibilities open up .",
    "it could happen that the @xmath1 interaction in the @xmath3 channel has a stronger dependence on density than that provided by existing models .",
    "this would be most interesting .",
    "however , we have also found that the smallness of the spectral function in the deuteron , close to threshold , is due to destructive interference between large pieces of the amplitude . if some of these pieces is substantially modified in the nuclear medium , the interference could disappear , and the spectral function would look more like phase space , as it is the case for @xmath111 production",
    ". this would be enough to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "new dedicated experiments , with a wider phase space , and at lower energies , where the interference effects are smaller are important to settle these questions .",
    "we also find that absorption of the incoming pion , leads the reaction to occur at the surface , therefore reducing the signals of any density dependent effect .",
    "electromagnetically induced reactions , free from such a disadvantage are clearly called for to investigate the medium effects on the @xmath1 interaction in the @xmath3 channel    one of us ( m.j.v.v . ) would like to acknowledge useful discussions with l.l .",

    "this factor depends smoothly in vacuum on the invariant mass of the two pion system , and is practically constant over the available phase space region of the @xmath182 decay .",
    "we thus take a corrected value for @xmath173 @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the value of @xmath181 at the average invariant mass of the two pions in the @xmath182 decay .",
    "the correction is not as important for the @xmath185 case .",
    "first , because only a small part of the partial width produces pion pairs in the scalar isoscalar channel , and second because at the low energies of the experiment under analysis , the contribution of this kind of mechanisms is small .",
