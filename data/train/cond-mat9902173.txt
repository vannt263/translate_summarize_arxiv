    "the possibility of fabricating @xcite tunnel junctions containing nanoscale particles has opened up new areas of exploration .",
    "experiments can now probe the energy spectrum in these particles and study changes as a function of temperature and magnetic field @xcite . in this way one can observe changes in the spectrum that are expected to occur in the bulk due to phase transitions , and determine to what extent these concepts are relevant for small systems @xcite .",
    "the unprecedented control over experimental conditions  changes due to a single tunneling electron can be observed  allows one to ask and address questions which , until now , have been academic only .    in this study",
    "we follow the experiments of tinkham _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and address the issues concerning superconductivity in small systems .",
    "specifically they studied small superconducting al particles ( diameter of order 10 nm ) and probed , through tunneling experiments , the excitation spectrum as a function of temperature and magnetic field . in attempting to treat small electronic systems",
    ", there are many concerns related to possible surface and impurity effects , both of which could lead to localization , for example . for",
    "the present we ignore these potential complications , and instead focus on a question which arises in the application of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite theory of superconductivity : to what extent is the grand canonical ensemble useful ( which in the thermodynamic limit , is equivalent to the canonical one ) for systems with a small number of electrons ?    we propose to tackle this question in a systematic way , using the attractive hubbard model .",
    "the choice of this model is motivated by several factors .",
    "it has long served as a paradigm for s - wave superconductivity , and serves as the ` minimal ' model that best describes superconductivity .",
    "all the energy scales are very well defined in the problem , so that no high frequency ( and ill - defined ) cutoffs are required @xcite .",
    "exact solutions are available in one dimension via bethe ansatz techniques @xcite , and the grand canonical bcs solutions have recently been evaluated for large system sizes @xcite .",
    "in fact in that work some preliminary canonical solutions were also examined , but only for very small system sizes . in this work",
    "we reformulate the canonical solution , in such a way that larger systems up to three dimensions can be tackled .",
    "we note that after this work was completed , a paper appeared @xcite in which the canonical bcs equations were formulated and solved for a model system with uniformly spaced level spacings .",
    "we will comment on the similarities and differences with our own work in the course of our discussion below .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate the problem .",
    "we mention the work of falicov and proetto @xcite , who applied a canonical bcs method to the problem of electrons on a tetrahedron ( a ` small ' fcc lattice ) .",
    "we have generalized this method for larger systems , and solved the ensuing equations numerically .",
    "however , memory requirements become very demanding , and therefore , beyond a certain lattice size , we had to abandon this approach .",
    "we include it in the appendix , nonetheless , because the variational wave function in this method is more general than the bcs canonical wave function , and the variational equation is linear . in practice , however , as will be shown , this wave function only marginally improves the ground state energy .",
    "we then formulate the canonical variational problem strictly in terms of the @xmath3 s familiar from the grand canonical solution @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations are tedious , and can be cast in a more enlightening form by following the pioneering work of dietrich , mang and pradal @xcite , who solved the canonical bcs problem for nuclei .",
    "this `` method of residues '' is based on representing expectation values in the bcs canonical ensemble through contour integrals of the bcs grand canonical ensemble expectation values : the latter seems to have started with a paper by bayman @xcite .",
    "this is also the methodology adopted by braun and von delft @xcite , who numerically evaluated residue integrals by fast fourier transform . as will be explained , however , we chose to evaluate the required integrals analytically ( which requires numerical summations ) . a concise summary of the residue method and further references are available in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we provide a review of the grand canonical formulation and the bethe ansatz solutions in one dimension @xcite , for purposes of comparison .",
    "we have also performed some numerical diagonalizations , although these are limited to small systems and ( in one dimension ) serve only to verify the bethe ansatz solutions . in both the grand canonical and canonical bcs formulations we have performed the variation strictly in terms of the single set of parameters , @xmath3 .",
    "this departs from more conventional treatments where two sets of parameters , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , are used , with an auxiliary relation between them .",
    "our formulation is conceptually clearer , but slightly more cumbersome , so some details are provided .",
    "the following section is devoted to numerical results .",
    "all the computational results presented in this paper will be in one dimension .",
    "this is because the exact results for ` large ' systems are only available in 1-d , and therefore it is presently only in this case that one can study the full crossover from the bulk limit to small systems .",
    "because the attractive hubbard model is a very local model , many of the features of the variational solution will remain in higher dimension ; in fact we expect the agreement of the canonical bcs results with the exact ones to improve , but we have no way at present to check this .",
    "in addition , many of the features of the solutions in higher dimensions ( such as long range order ) will not be present in one dimension .",
    "a more systematic study of the canonical bcs solution in two and three dimensions will be presented elsewhere ( unfortunately without exact checks , except for very small systems ) .    aside from evaluations of the canonical bcs formulation",
    "we will demonstrate the so - called ` parity effect ' @xcite , where qualitative differences in the tunneling gap can be observed , depending on whether an even or odd number of electrons occupies the small al particle .",
    "while this has been understood within a parity - conserved grand canonical bcs formulation @xcite , it becomes much clearer in a canonical formulation .",
    "in addition we have found an interesting @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 effect , where @xmath2 is an integer . in our case",
    "we have observed oscillations as a function of electron number .",
    "therefore we have variations in the gap between odd , even and _ super - even _ ( i.e. multiples of 4 ) electrons .",
    "hints of such behaviour , noted as a function of _ lattice size _ , were first discussed by fye _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the concluding section summarizes our results . in the appendix we outline the formulation of the linearized canonical variation",
    "the attractive hubbard hamiltonian is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the number operator for an electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 ( @xmath10 is the index for the primitive vector @xmath12 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 is the hopping rate of electrons from one site to a neighbouring site @xmath14 away ( often nearest neighbours only are included ) , and @xmath15 is the coupling strength between electrons on the same site ; here the fact that it is attractive is explicitly included from the beginning . in , we have fourier transformed the hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions for @xmath16 sites in each dimension .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the creation and annihilation operators in the reciprocal space , and the kinetic energy is given by @xmath19 where @xmath14 is the coordinate vector connecting sites @xmath10 to @xmath20 .",
    "we perform variational calculations using the component of the bcs wave function that has a given number of pairs @xmath21 and thus conserves the number of electrons @xmath22 .",
    "the bcs wave function is a superposition of pair states with all the possible numbers of pairs @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the vacuum state , and @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath21-pair component @xmath27 can be obtained by rearranging @xmath28 into a power series of the pair creation operator @xmath29 and can be written as @xmath30 here we have defined @xmath31 .",
    "the condition @xmath32 for the @xmath33 sums in means that all the @xmath34 s should be different and ordered so that all the different combinations of @xmath33 are counted once each : the latter condition is removed for the sums in and the division by @xmath35 compensates for the multiple counting . in a finite system with @xmath16 sites in each dimension , the wave number can take @xmath36 values , where @xmath37 is the dimension of the system , and hence the @xmath21 sums over @xmath38 s in result in @xmath39 terms .",
    "we begin by reviewing the grand canonical formulation of bcs theory .",
    "we have opted , contrary to convention , to formulate the minimization problem in terms of only the variational parameters , @xmath40 ( and not the @xmath41 s and @xmath42 s ) .",
    "this was originally motivated by the loss of clear meaning for the @xmath41 s and @xmath42 s in the canonical ensemble , though in fact one can proceed equally well with these @xcite .",
    "one therefore simply writes : |bcs_gc = c _ * k*(1+g _ a_*k*^a_-*k*^)|0,[bcswfg ] where the coefficient @xmath43 properly normalizes the wave function .",
    "one then calculates the various expectation values to determine the ground state energy : @xmath44 where , in this case , the wave function is the bcs grand canonical one given in eq .",
    "( [ bcswfg ] ) .",
    "for example , the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator , @xmath45 is @xmath46 note that normally the product and the denominator are absent because these factors are normally defined to be unity due to normalization . also note that the @xmath47 s are generally complex , but can be chosen to be real ; this is presumed in eq .",

    "we have written the total energy term by term in the following sequence : the first term is the kinetic energy , the following two come from cooper pair scattering ( @xmath50 ) , and the fourth term is the hartree term ( @xmath51 ) . when displayed this way",
    "it is apparent that the last term excludes the spurious hartree term whereby an electron interacts with itself ( a ` @xmath52 effect ' ) .",
    "it is also apparent that the _ reduced _ bcs hamiltonian ( @xmath50 scattering only ) will exclude this last term , and in doing so omits the hartree term ( since it is often deemed to merely represent a shift in energies ) . at the same time eq .",
    "( [ grand_e ] ) appears to have terms of order @xmath52 smaller than the dominant terms .",

    "the entire expression is now clearly extensive , as it should be , though in this form _ pairing _ terms of order @xmath52 have been mixed in with the hartree term .",

    "we initially adopted this method of canonical variation , which actually allows more variational freedom than using the @xmath47 s .",
    "however , as one can readily appreciate , the number of variational parameters grows very quickly with increasing lattice size , and therefore in practice , this method has limited usage . where it was practical , however , we carried out these calculations and compared them with the canonical bcs results to be described below .",
    "the gain in accuracy for the ground state energy was fairly small .",
    "our formulation and results in this case are summarized in the appendix .",
    "the cost of working with the @xmath47 s is that the problem remains a very nonlinear one .",
    "nonetheless the gain in computational ease more than compensates for this , in that only @xmath16 variational parameters are required , where @xmath16 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "as we shall see , this allows us to easily study the limit from small systems to those that are well described by the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the formulation of this problem using the expression for @xmath27 given in is straightforward but tedious .",
    "we therefore follow the `` method of residues '' @xcite ( see also @xcite and more recently @xcite ) originally developed for the nuclear pairing problem .",
    "an advantage of this method is that matrix elements are more easily evaluated ( they remain as simple as the ones in the grand canonical formulation ) .",
    "moreover the energy and the resulting variational equation can be written in a compact way which parallels the grand canonical bcs equations .",
    "the starting point is to write in the general form as a particle - number projection of the grand canonical bcs state @xcite . in more general terms",
    ", this is the projection that restores the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( i.e. , conserved particle number in this case ) in the wave function @xcite .    for an even number of electrons the @xmath21-pair wave function in the projected form is @xmath69 where the contour is any counterclockwise path that encloses the origin .",
    "if we perform the residue integral above , we recover the desired wave function .    as written above the wave function",

    "note that the energy range is magnified compared with ( a ) , and that for the exact and canonical results , the even and odd energies are not distinguished by different symbols .",
    "for @xmath96 the agreement between the canonical and exact energies is excellent for all values of @xmath98 , and it is still very good for @xmath99 . in the latter case , the grand canonical curve happens to be very close to the exact results for odd numbers of electrons for larger density . as explained above , however ,",
    "the grand canonical results shown here must be compared for the even numbers only .",
    "in fact , the grand canonical energy for an even number of electrons differs most from the exact and canonical energies for larger density . on the other hand",
    ", the canonical energy converges to the grand canonical one as the system size becomes larger , as can be seen in ( b ) for @xmath100 .",
    "the even - odd difference is negligible for this weak coupling and large system size .",
    "fig2a.ps    in fig .  2 ,",
    "the ground state energy is plotted as a function of the coupling strength for @xmath99 and 64 , for various densities with ( a ) even and ( b ) odd numbers of electrons . for small systems ,",
    "the canonical results improve the grand canonical ones , especially for intermediate coupling strengths , while the former converge to the latter as the coupling strength is increased .",
    "this can be seen for @xmath99 in ( a ) .",
    "in fact for @xmath101 , the exact ( solid ) and canonical ( dashed ) lines are indistinguishable , though the grand canonical one deviates from them only slightly .",
    "the three results converge as the coupling goes to zero , and also in the strong - coupling limit . for @xmath102 ,",
    "the size is large enough that the canonical and grand canonical results are converged in the given scale for all densities and coupling strengths .",
    "fig2b.ps    in ( b ) , the canonical and exact energies are compared for odd electron numbers . for @xmath99 , compared with ( a ) , the exact energy is reproduced rather poorly by the canonical bcs approximation , especially for larger coupling strengths . moreover , unlike the even number case , the canonical bcs results do not converge to the exact ones as the coupling strength is increased further .",
    "this difference between the errors in the energy by the even- and odd-@xmath79 canonical bcs approximation turns out to be smaller as the system size becomes larger . for @xmath102 ,",
    "the difference between the even and odd cases has diminished significantly from the @xmath99 case .",
    "we show the energy gap as a function of the density for ( a ) @xmath103 , ( b ) @xmath104 and ( c ) @xmath97 ; for @xmath96 and 8 ( upper figures ) and @xmath94 ( lower figures ) in and for @xmath100 ( upper ) and 64 ( lower ) in .",
    "again , the exact and canonical results ( @xmath84 in ) are plotted with symbols and the grand canonical results ( @xmath105 in ) are shown with curves . in the upper parts of , the exact solutions for @xmath96 and 8 are the circles and squares , respectively , and the corresponding canonical results are the crosses and stars .",
    "the gaps for odd numbers of electrons are negative .",
    "as discussed above , the conventional bcs wave function that is used in this work does not contain the odd-@xmath79 components , and thus the gap parameter defined by misses out the gap for odd electron numbers .",
    "for even electron numbers , the canonical bcs method improves the grand canonical results significantly for weak coupling and small system size .    in ( a ) for @xmath103 and @xmath96 , 8 and 16",
    ", we can see the excellent agreement between the exact and canonical bcs results .",
    "furthermore , there is a striking feature in these figures  the difference between the gaps for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath2 is an integer .",
    "( note that for all the results shown , the number of sites is a multiple of four . ) the gaps for @xmath107 are much larger than those for @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , it is clearly seen for @xmath94 that the gaps for @xmath107 increase as the density increases .",
    "we call these oscillations in the gap as a function of the even-@xmath79 the _ super - even _ effect : the system is more stable with @xmath1 electrons than with @xmath0 electrons .",
    "this effect is more pronounced when the coupling is weak , and it stems from the quantized and doubly degenerate energy levels , @xmath108 , of the unperturbed system . as will be shown later , when the coupling is weak , the occupation probabilities of the unperturbed states can be approximated by those for zero coupling .",
    "we can thus understand the super - even effect as follows , in terms of the unperturbed energy levels which are occupied by pairs of electrons up to the fermi level and are empty above it . to simplify the discussion , we ignore the energy change due to the blocked states by unpaired electrons",
    ".    in the case of one dimension and with @xmath109 , the unperturbed energy , , reduces to @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the lattice constant . from the periodic boundary condition , @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , and each energy level is degenerate for @xmath114 except for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "hence each level with @xmath117 can accommodate two pairs , ( @xmath118 ) and ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "thus when there are @xmath1 electrons , in the ground state , all the levels from @xmath115 up to @xmath120 are fully occupied by the pairs , while with @xmath0 electrons , the fermi level has a vacancy for one more pair .",
    "therefore , when there are @xmath0 electrons , a way to break a pair with the minimum energy is to flip the spin of an electron of the pair at the fermi level .",
    "the unpaired electrons then occupy the states @xmath121 and there is no extra cost for the kinetic energy . on the other hand ,",
    "when there are @xmath1 electrons , one can not break either pair at the fermi level simply by flipping a spin , but an unpaired electron has to move up to the next available level , increasing the kinetic energy .",
    "this is why the gap for pair breaking is larger for @xmath1 electrons than for @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the fact that the former gap increases as a function of @xmath79 is particular to the one - dimensional band structure that we use : the level spacing becomes maximum around @xmath122 ( i.e. , half filling ) and so does the kinetic energy cost for breaking a pair .",
    "the super - even effect can be recognized more clearly in ( a ) for @xmath100 and 64 .",
    "the overall scale of the gap becomes smaller for larger system size ( note the reduced scale compared to ( a ) ) . for 32 sites , the canonical bcs results still follow the exact solutions closely for almost all density values . for 64 sites ,",
    "the system is so large that even for this weak coupling , the canonical gaps are converged to the grand canonical curve in the dilute limit .",
    "the canonical results more or less follow the exact ones for @xmath123 , where the super - even effect is manifest .",
    "it can be seen in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 4(a ) that for larger density , where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 gaps are well separated , the grand canonical bcs completely misses the exact gaps for @xmath107 . on the other hand ,",
    "the grand canonical curves appear to follow closely the exact @xmath0 gaps .",
    "however , as the size is made larger than 64 sites , the exact @xmath0 gaps become smaller than the gap given by the grand canonical curve ( see the bottom graph of ( a ) ) and finally in the bulk limit , they are quite small compared to the grand canonical values ; at @xmath124 , the exact and grand canonical @xmath125 are about 0.003 and 0.015 , respectively @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the canonical @xmath0 gaps go up towards the grand canonical curve , as they ( and the @xmath126 gaps ) converge to the grand canonical values . hence for some particular sizes ( larger than 64 sites ) ,",
    "the canonical results for the @xmath0 gaps will be closer to the exact ones .",
    "in fact the grand canonical gaps tend to have a discontinuity at @xmath107 , but either value is generally well below the exact or canonical value . for smaller density where the super - even oscillations are not so prominent",
    ", the grand canonical gaps have cusps at @xmath107 , as can be seen , e.g. , for @xmath102 and @xmath127 in ( a ) .",
    "also , as the coupling strength is made a little larger but still small ( @xmath128 ) , these discontinuities at larger density are replaced by cusps .",
    "this can be seen in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 4(b ) for @xmath104 .",
    "while for the small sizes shown in ( b ) there are still discontinuities for @xmath129 , for the larger sizes in ( b ) the curves are continuous for all densities , with cusps at @xmath107 .",
    "it is intriguing that the grand canonical bcs partially reproduces the super - even oscillations in this way .",
    "the grand canonical solutions in the zero - coupling limit will be discussed further below .    for @xmath96 and 8 in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the agreement between the canonical and exact gaps is still very good , and the overall structure of the gaps as a function of the density is the same as for @xmath103 . for 16 sites , the canonical results deviate slightly but still reproduce the exact gaps well . for small density ,",
    "the canonical even-@xmath79 gaps are closer to the grand canonical curve , while for larger density the canonical @xmath107 gaps significantly improve the grand canonical curve .",
    "as the system becomes larger , the super - even oscillations diminish in amplitudes and also are confined more towards half filling . also , as the size increases , for larger density where the ( exact and canonical ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 gaps are well separated , the grand canonical curve shifts up relative to them , from near the @xmath0 gaps to above the @xmath1 gaps .",
    "this can be seen in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 4(b ) in increasing order in size .",
    "for 32 sites , the last two cusps in the grand canonical curve happen to be closer to the exact values than the canonical ones .",
    "however , the canonical gaps capture the correct behaviour of the super - even oscillations .",
    "finally for 64 sites , the canonical gaps are converged to the grand canonical one for low density , while they are much better for higher density , especially for @xmath106 .    as the coupling strength is increased further ( for a fixed size )",
    ", the scale of the gap increases as a whole for both even and odd @xmath79 ( thus the even - odd difference becomes larger ) , while the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 difference decreases .",
    "for example , it can be seen in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 4(c ) that @xmath97 is strong enough for most of the sizes shown for the system to reach the `` bulk '' limit , where the canonical and grand canonical methods hardly differ from one another .",
    "even for @xmath96 and 8 , the super - even structure is gone , and the canonical gaps are closer to the grand canonical ones .    to see the effect of the coupling strength on the energy gap , we plot in ( a ) the gap as a function of the coupling strength for @xmath99 ( upper ) and 64 ( lower ) , for quarter ( @xmath130 ) and half filling .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath99 the exact gaps for quarter and half filling are almost the same for all @xmath15 values , whereas for @xmath102 they are somewhat different . on the contrary , in the bcs picture ( both canonical and grand canonical )",
    ", the difference between quarter and half filling in the strong - coupling limit is about the same for small ( @xmath99 ) and large ( @xmath102 ) sizes and much larger than the exact result . as for the difference between the canonical and grand canonical results",
    ", we first note that @xmath106 for both cases shown in ( a ) . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the canonical and grand canonical results are equally good for weak coupling ( @xmath131 ) , whereas the canonical gaps improve the grand canonical ones slightly for stronger coupling .",
    "for large systems and for very weak coupling , the grand canonical results are better than the canonical ones .",
    "this can be seen for @xmath102 for @xmath132 for half filling , as we have seen in ( a ) .",
    "as the coupling becomes stronger , the canonical gap converges to the grand canonical one , and this happens faster for larger systems .",
    "indeed for 64 sites , the two curves for @xmath133 can barely be distinguished in the given scale both for quarter and half filling , although half filling is a special case where the canonical gap defined by does not converge to the conventional bcs gap  this will be discussed shortly .",
    "fig5a.ps    in ( b ) , we compare the magnitude of the exact and canonical gaps for even and odd @xmath79 for half filling , for 8 and 64 sites . for smaller systems ,",
    "the magnitude of the gap for even @xmath79 ( @xmath134 ) is a little larger than the one for odd @xmath79 ( @xmath135 ) , as can be seen for @xmath99 .",
    "this difference is slightly larger for the exact solutions than the canonical bcs results . as the coupling strength or the system size",
    "is increased , this difference between the magnitude of the even ( @xmath0 ) and odd gaps diminishes .",
    "this can be seen in ( b ) .",
    "also note that the difference between the bcs gap and the exact gap increases as the system size increases .",
    "( this can be seen in ( a ) as well . )",
    "this is due to the fact that the exact gap becomes smaller for larger systems , whereas the canonical gap in the strong - coupling limit hardly changes as the system becomes larger ( and @xmath102 is large enough to be the bulk limit for @xmath136 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , for very weak coupling , the grand canonical gaps have discontinuities for @xmath107 at larger density .",
    "we can understand how these discontinuities arise , by looking at the density as a function of the chemical potential in the zero - coupling limit .",
    "in ( a ) we show the density ( top ) and the gap @xmath137 ( middle ) as a function of the chemical potential @xmath48 , and @xmath137 as a function of the density @xmath98 ( bottom ) , for zero coupling and @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "there is no gap equation and @xmath98 is simply determined by for a given @xmath48 .",
    "thus the existence of a gap is solely due to the finite system size .",
    "it can be seen in the top figure that as @xmath48 changes continuously , the density @xmath98 changes as a step function : it is multi - valued when @xmath48 is equal to any of the discrete @xmath142 due to the orbital and spin degeneracy . as @xmath48 moves from one level to the next",
    ", the density stays the same , whereas @xmath143 increases from zero , peaks when @xmath48 is precisely between the two levels , and falls to zero again .",
    "hence @xmath137 as a function of @xmath98 has @xmath144-function - like peaks , as seen in the bottom figure .",
    "when the coupling is nonzero , @xmath98 and @xmath48 must satisfy not only the number equation but the gap equation = 1n_*k*12e_*k * = 1n_*k*12,[bcs_gap ] which is obtained by substituting into .",
    "it turns out that when the coupling is weak , @xmath145 given by can not take certain values in between two levels ( corresponding to the plateau regions in @xmath98 in ( a ) ) , and this can be understood in the following way .    for weak coupling",
    ", we can consider the relation between the density and chemical potential ( @xmath146 ) roughly in the same way as for the zero - coupling case : for @xmath106 , @xmath146 is very close to one of the levels @xmath142 ( when @xmath138 , it is equal to @xmath142 ) , while for @xmath107 it must be in between two levels .",
    "therefore for @xmath106 , @xmath147 and thus @xmath54 must be finite for @xmath98 to have a certain value ( see ) . for @xmath107 ,",
    "however , if @xmath148 is finite , then @xmath54 is driven to zero so that the rhs of attains a large enough value for small @xmath15 . indeed , for sufficiently small @xmath15 , even if @xmath54 is zero , be satisfied for @xmath146 near the middle of the range between two levels .",
    "instead @xmath146 is driven towards either level , so that the rhs of increases sufficiently to equal the lhs .",
    "the number equation is still satisfied , since @xmath149 .",
    "thus certain values of @xmath146 are not allowed for small values of @xmath15 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in ( b ) for @xmath103 . in the top part ,",
    "the abrupt jumps in @xmath98 seen in ( a ) have been somewhat smoothed , whereas the plateau parts have disappeared . accordingly",
    "the gap becomes discontinuous as a function of @xmath146 as well as @xmath98 . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath137 indeed has two values for a given @xmath98 at each discontinuity shown , corresponding to the two solutions for @xmath146 for coming up from a lower level and coming down from the next level . in any case , all values of @xmath98 are possible ( in contrast to @xmath146 ) .",
    "fig6b.ps    for smaller density or larger system size , the level spacings become smaller , and it becomes possible for @xmath146 to have all the values in between levels .",
    "this also occurs for stronger coupling , as can be seen in ( c ) for @xmath95 , where @xmath137 is now continuous and has cusps at @xmath107 .",
    "these cusps come about when the coupling is still weak enough so that @xmath54 is small , and for the same reason as in the zero - coupling case , that is , when @xmath150 becomes a maximum .",
    "it is intriguing that the weak but nonzero coupling picture described above does not interpolate smoothly to the zero - coupling case .",
    "as @xmath15 decreases , the slope of @xmath98 ( centred around @xmath106 ) as a function of @xmath146 seen in ( b ) ( top frame ) will become sharper , while the corresponding curves in @xmath151 will be reduced to points . at exactly @xmath138",
    ", @xmath98 becomes vertical around @xmath106 for all @xmath2 .",

    "as defined by , the gap @xmath105 is the lowest quasi - particle energy @xmath153 . the minimum energy required for breaking a pair is @xmath154 and",

    "since the grand canonical bcs yields the same behaviour of @xmath195 , this can be understood by the simple expression of .",
    "as @xmath15 approaches zero , @xmath54 goes to zero , and @xmath172 can be expanded up to the leading order in @xmath54 . then reduces to g _",
    "thus in the limit of @xmath199 and @xmath200 , g_&&_bcs2|_-| ( _ > ) + and & & + g_&&2|_-|_bcs(_<).hence @xmath201 for @xmath202 , while for @xmath203 , @xmath47 diverges in the zero - coupling limit , and provides an image of @xmath204 ( note that for half filling , @xmath205 ) .",
    "fig8a.ps    furthermore , the occupation probability clearly shows how the distribution over the unperturbed states changes as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "it can be seen in ( b ) that the distribution function for the non - interacting case is recovered for weak coupling ; @xmath206 for @xmath207 and 0 for @xmath208 , and @xmath209 at the doubly degenerate fermi level . in ( b ) , not only the scale is reduced compared to ( a ) , but also the relative ( average ) height of @xmath210 at @xmath93 against the one in the zero - coupling limit is larger . thus @xmath210 may appear to have more variation as a function of @xmath197 in the strong - coupling limit than @xmath211 does .",
    "however , the difference between the maximum and minimum values at @xmath93 are approximately the same for both cases , and @xmath210 is about 0.7 at @xmath192 and about 0.3 at the edges of the band .",
    "as the coupling is made stronger , the occupation probability ( and @xmath211 ) becomes almost equal for all the states , and @xmath212 for all @xmath197 in the case of half filling .",
    "we have formulated bcs theory for a canonical ensemble , following earlier work by dietrich _",
    ". _ @xcite and falicov and proetto @xcite , and very recently by braun and von delft @xcite .",
    "we have also generalized the linear formulation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for any system size .",
    "however , this method has proven to be numerically too intensive for `` large '' systems , and provided at best only marginal improvement over the nonlinear canonical formulation .",
    "in this work we have adopted a very definite model , the attractive hubbard model , for various reasons .",
    "first , we wanted to have an exact solution with which to monitor the improvement over the grand canonical scheme .",
    "these are available for the hubbard model in one dimension by the bethe ansatz technique , and so we have used these as a benchmark throughout this work .",
    "second , we wanted to study a system which , by choice of parameters , could easily span the weak coupling to strong coupling regime , as well as the low density to high density limits . in this way we have observed the crossover from the bulk to quantum limit for a variety of regimes .",
    "the attractive hubbard model is no doubt the `` minimal '' model that accomplishes this . finally , we wanted to use a model which could readily be generalized to a realistic case , so , for example , one could use a parametrized tight - binding model to fit the band structure for al to better describe ultrasmall metallic al grains .    in this work , however , we focused on the first two points listed above , with the goal of establishing generic trends .",
    "the existence of the parity effect , as already determined by a parity - projected grand canonical scheme @xcite and more recently by the canonical formulation of a uniformly - spaced - level model @xcite , emerges quite naturally in this model .",
    "however , in addition to the even - odd effect , we have found a _ super - even _ effect , with oscillations in the superconducting gap occurring between even electron numbers which are multiples of 4 ( @xmath213 ) and non - multiples of 4 ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the gap variation for even numbers of electrons is , in some cases , comparable to the even - odd variation , i.e. @xmath215 .",
    "thus , such oscillations should be observable in the same kind of tunneling experiments for seeing the even - odd effect .",
    "we note , however , a key ingredient for the super - even effect to occur is the double degeneracy of levels , which in our case comes about from the simple equality , @xmath216 . in a more general case , the degeneracy structure will be more complicated , and therefore oscillations will exist but may not be as simply periodic as a function of electron number as is the case here .",
    "the super - even effect is also a result of quantized energy levels due to finite system size , and the effect will be stronger for smaller systems . for very weak coupling , the grand canonical bcs fails to reproduce the super - even effect , while the canonical scheme does ; indeed , it yields very good agreement with the exact solutions .",
    "finally , we note that the grand canonical bcs quasi - particle dispersion relation was beautifully reproduced by the canonical results , _ simply by varying the odd number ground state momentum _",
    ", with the proviso that the electron and hole momenta were the same .",
    "this simple correspondence is quite surprising .",
    "this research was supported by the avadh bhatia fellowship and by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and the canadian institute for advanced research .",
    "we are grateful to bob teshima for his help in efficiently evaluating the residue integrals using the analytical results .",
    "k.t . thanks rajat bhaduri , jules carbotte and elisabeth nicol for helpful comments and discussions .",
    "calculations were performed on the 42 node sgi parallel processor at the university of alberta .",
    "we summarize the linearized formulation of the canonical variation .",
    "in addition to the wave function for @xmath22 defined by , we define the wave function for odd number of electrons @xmath78 , following @xcite as |_2 + 1=&a_*q*^ & _ * k*_1<_*k*_2 < _ < * k * _ c(*k*_1,*k*_2,,*k * _ ) + & & _ i=1^a_*k*_i^a_-*k*_i^|0,[cwfo ] where spin of the extra electron @xmath9 can be either up or down . the extra electron blocks the state @xmath85 from being occupied by pairs",
    "there is no variational parameter for the blocked state : for the variational calculations , we always choose @xmath85 that gives the lowest energy . note that the @xmath61 s in the above equation are different from those for the same number of pairs in due to the missing @xmath85 .",
    "we now derive the variational equation using @xmath217 in for an even number of electrons @xmath22 .",
    "the formulae below are slightly modified for an odd number of electrons @xmath78 in terms of the odd wave function .",
    "we mention the difference for @xmath78 in the end .",

    "calculation of the potential energy term is more tedious .",
    "after some lengthy operator algebra it can be written in a general form for @xmath21 pairs as & & _",

    "the other terms systematically consider the various cases when one pair is scattered into another ( unoccupied ) pair state .    in the following ,",
    "we take the @xmath61 s to be real variables . in it",
    "has been proved for the bcs formulation that for negative pairing - type interactions , real ( and positive ) variational parameters yield the lowest energy . the minimization condition for the energy with respect to the real @xmath68 results in the equation c(*k*_1,,*k*_)&=&-1d|u|n,[csol ] where",
    "d = e_-2(_*k*_1++_*k * _ ) + |u|n^2 .",
    "[ cdenom ] this should be solved for all the @xmath61 s selfconsistently .",
    "for an odd number of electrons , in the energy expectation value and the variational equation in terms of @xmath220 , the blocked @xmath85 is excluded in all the @xmath221 sums and @xmath222 sums .",
    "other than that , the normalization factor for @xmath220 is the same as : the kinetic energy term is the same as except that @xmath223 should be replaced by @xmath224 : the potential energy term is the same as except that the factor @xmath225 should be replaced by @xmath226 : the variational equation is the same as , while in @xmath227 as defined in @xmath228 should be added and @xmath226 should be replaced by @xmath229 .",
    "we have found that this linear variation in terms of the @xmath61 s just barely improves the ground state energy , compared to the nonlinear variation in terms of the @xmath230 s .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath61-formulation does not improve the @xmath230-formulation for the energy gap .",
    "we illustrate this in for @xmath94 and for @xmath104 and 4 .",
    "we found that for smaller system size , the two formulations do not make any difference for any coupling strength , for the gap as well as the ground state energy . for larger system size ( which was limited for @xmath231 ) the gap from the @xmath61-formulation",
    "is slightly worse than the one from the @xmath230-formulation for weak coupling and larger density .",
