    "basing on the assumptions concerning subvalent bi states we studied several bismuth - related centers in and networks , as follows :    * trivalent bi substitutional center ; * divalent bi substitutional center ; * @xmath0 interstitial molecule ; * interstitial single - changed ion , @xmath1 , and interstitial atom , @xmath2 ; * and complexes formed by interstitial bi atom and glass intrinsic defect , or oxygen vacancy ; * interstitial bi dimers , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "we believe that our choice covers sufficiently wide range of the most probable bismuth - related centers in and glasses .",
    "according to our modeling of bi substitutional centers in and networks , bi atoms occupying , respectively , si or ge sites , can form substitutional centers of two types , threefold coordinated bi atoms bonded by three bridging o atoms with si ( ge ) atoms , and fourfold coordinated bi atoms in bi - pyramidal configuration bonded by four bridging o atoms with si ( ge ) atoms .",
    "in addition to bridging o atoms , in both cases there are also o atoms completing the bi atoms coordination to fivefold or sixfold ones .",
    "these o atoms interact slightly with bi atoms forming only very weak bonds .",
    "threefold ( to be more specific , @xmath29- or @xmath30-fold ) coordination of atoms is typical of trivalent bi compounds and of impurity bismuth centers in many hosts ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fourfold ( @xmath31- or @xmath32-fold ) coordination of bi atoms is known to occur in some crystalline bismuth compounds ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "sometimes the absorption corresponding to the @xmath39 transition is present as well .",
    "wavelengths of absorption and luminescence bands are subject to wide variations depending on the host : luminescence in the 0.280.55  m range is excited by absorption in the 0.230.33  m range .",
    "lifetimes of excited states responsible for the luminescence are typically of 15  s in different hosts .",
    "the results of our modeling suggest that these variations may be explained by a prevailing coordination of trivalent bi .",
    "e.g. in the most intensive absorption band of the threefold coordinated bi atom is found to be near 0.26  m but the same band of the fourfold coordinated bi atom turns out to be shifted to 0.22  m. in the absorption bands of threefold and fourfold coordinated bi atoms occur near 0.24 and 0.23  m , respectively .",
    "stokes shift turn out to be large in all these cases .",
    "hence we can do no more than suggest , by analogy with the experimental data available @xcite , that the luminescence in the 0.30.4  m range may be excited in the above - mentioned absorption bands .",
    "the modeling revealed that in network the divalent bismuth forms twofold coordinated bi atoms bonded by bridging o atoms with si atoms . in such twofold coordinated bi atom",
    "does not occur since network readily transforms resulting in a formation of threefold coordinated bi atom ( the above - described trivalent substitutional center ) , sixfold coordinated ge atom , and threefold coordinated o atom .",
    "calculation of electron density distribution by bader s method proves the effective charge of twofold coordinated bi atom to be @xmath40 .",

    "the effective charges of o and si atoms calculated using the same approach are found to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "however it seems reasonable to discuss certain suggestions @xcite in more detail .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , there are luminescence centers of two types in",
    ". bi centers of the first type are responsible for ir luminescence near 1.4  m with a long lifetime excited only by intra - center absorption . centers of the second type give rise to red luminescence near 0.63  m with a short lifetime excited not only by intra - center absorption but by electron - hole recombination as well .",
    "such centers trap electrons excited to the conduction band by two - photon absorption of intense uv laser light , and the recombination of trapped electrons with holes gives rise to red luminescence .",
    "the centers responsible for ir luminescence are not quenched up to the temperature of 700  k , but the red luminescence centers are thermally quenched at temperatures @xmath63  k ( [ itm : vii ] in page  ) .",
    "such different properties of bismuth - related centers might be explained by the fact that the first - type center weakly interacts with the glass network and , as a result , it is temperature - resistant and can not capture conductive electrons and participate in the process of electron - hole recombination excitation of the luminescence .",
    "the second - type center is embedded in the glass network and hence it is subject to temperature quenching and is able to capture conductive electrons with subsequent excitation of red luminescence owing to electron - hole recombination .",
    "the results of modeling bismuth - related centers described in sections  [ sec : bi^2 + ] and [ sec : bi_and_o_vacancy ] allow an understanding the assumptions made by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of their experimental data .",
    "indeed , if the ir luminescence center in is a complex of interstitial bi atom and intrinsic defect , oxygen vacancy , its thermal stability should be only somewhat lower than the stability of the vacancy , since in such a complex the bi atom forms only weak bonds with the glass network .",
    "further , these bonds are formed with si atoms of the vacancy , but not with o atoms .",
    "this eliminates the possibility of recombination of an electron trapped in such a center with a hole in the glass valence band , since in the states near the upper edge of the valence band are formed mainly by non - bonding 2p electron states ( lone pairs ) of bridging o atoms . on the other hand , if the red luminescence center in is the divalent bi substitutional atom , @xmath46 , with the bi atom covalently bonded with two bridging o atoms ,",
    "the thermal stability of such a center should be considerably lower than the stability of the vacancy owing to low coordination of the bi atom .",
    "the bridging o atoms in this center allow effective recombination of a hole with a trapped electron .    to realize the possibility of conduction electron to be captured in the defects under consideration we calculated electron affinities of complex and of @xmath46 substitutional center using the approach developed in ref .",
    "the electron affinity is found to be approximately of 2.1 and 4.2  ev for these centers , respectively . according to different estimations @xcite , electron affinity of vitreous host",
    "is known to be from 0.9 to 2.7  ev .",
    "hence our calculations suggest that conduction electron can be readily trapped in divalent bi substitutional center , @xmath46 , and can hardly be trapped in center .",
    "this is in obvious agreement with the assumptions made in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as noted above ,",
    "comparing the results of lifetime calculations with the experimental data on the excited states responsible for the luminescence in and ( [ itm : viii ] in page  ) is meaningful only by an order of magnitude . for this purpose",
    "the calculated relative lifetimes are listed in table  [ tab : lifetimes ] with the lifetime corresponding to the most intensive transition in @xmath37 substitutional center ( the absorption near 0.25  m , the luminescence in the 0.30.4  m range , see section  [ sec : bi^3 + ] ) taken to be unity .",
    "the lifetime of corresponding luminescence of trivalent bi in different hosts is known to be 15  s @xcite . using this estimation together with the data given in table  [ tab : lifetimes ]",
    "one can easily see that the results of lifetime calculations agree satisfactorily with the experimental data both for ir luminescence of and centers and red luminescence of @xmath46 substitutional center .",
    "basing on the results of our modeling of bismuth - related centers in and glasses and taking into account the assumption concerning common origin of bi centers responsible for ir luminescence in silica and germania glasses , it may be safely suggested that the bismuth - related centers of near - ir luminescence in and glasses are mainly represented by the and complexes formed by interstitial bi atoms and intrinsic defects of glass , and oxygen vacancies .",
    "interstitial @xmath0 molecules and negatively charged @xmath4 dimers might also contribute to the ir luminescence in glass as well but are absent in host .",
    "bismuth - related centers responsible for the visible ( red ) luminescence in the glass are likely to be represented by twofold coordinated bi atoms bonded with si atoms by bridging o atoms .",
