    "all key - quantities of ferromagnetism ( curie - temperature @xmath0 , magnetic moment @xmath2 , magnetization @xmath3 , susceptibility @xmath4 ,  ) are in the last analysis consequences of the electronic structure of the respective magnetic material .",
    "to understand ferromagnetism therefore means to understand the temperature - dependent electronic structure .",
    "our method , which we use to get reliable information in this respect , consists of three steps .",
    "first we choose a proper theoretical model , defined by its hamiltonian @xmath5 more strictly by the interaction part @xmath6 which shall incorporate all those interactions which are considered as relevant for the physical problem under study .",
    "the single - particle part , on the other hand , shall cover , besides the usual kinetic energy and the periodic lattice potential , the influences of all the other interactions which are not directly accounted for by @xmath7 . by definition",
    "they are not decisive for magnetism and the characteristic temperature - dependent electronic structure , but nevertheless , they may determine the rough structure of the energy spectrum being therefore non - negligible if our study aims at a more or less quantitative electronic structure description .",
    "we therefore perform in the second step a first principles bandstructure calculation on the basis of density functional theory ( dft ) and use the results as single - particle energies in @xmath8 .",
    "so we guarantee that all the other interactions show up in @xmath9 in an averaged but fairly realistic manner .",
    "however , one has carefully to avoid a double counting of just the relevant interactions , once explicitly in @xmath6 and then once more implicitly in the renormalized single - particle energies . how to circumvent this serious and well - known double counting problem",
    "shall be explained for the actual problem at a later stage of this paper .    as a third step a many - body formalism",
    "is used for ( [ eq : hamil ] ) to work out how the effective single - particle energies change under the relevant interactions @xmath7 into a temperature- and concentration - dependent selfenergy @xmath10 from which we derive the quasiparticle bandstructure ( q - bs ) .",
    "the latter directly corresponds to the data of an angle- and spin - resolved photoemission experiment .",
    "we proceed in the following exactly along the line given by the just - developed concept . to do the first step , the fixing of a proper theoretical model , requires of course above all to agree upon",
    "which type of magnetic material shall be studied .",
    "we concentrate ourselves in this paper on so - called local - moment systems , i.  e.  on materials , the magnetic properties of which are due to strictly localized moments , while the conductivity properties are provoked by extended band states .",
    "typical examples are magnetic insulators such as euo , eus @xcite and magnetic metals as gd @xcite , which all have strictly localized moments because of the half - filled @xmath11 shell of the rare earth ion ( eu@xmath12 , gd@xmath13 ) .",
    "many striking features of these materials can be traced back to an intimate correlation between the localized magnetic moments and the extended band states .",
    "the same interaction is considered responsible for the properties of the intensively investigated diluted magnetic semiconductors like ga@xmath14mn@xmath15as .",
    "the ion creates simultaneously a localized @xmath16 moment and an itinerant hole in the gaas valence band @xcite , the interaction of which leads to ferromagnetism already for very low concentrations @xmath17 .",
    "another burning issue in this respect are the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials @xcite such as la@xmath14(ca , sr)@xmath18mno@xmath19 which exhibit a rich magnetic phase diagram as function of @xmath17 . for @xmath20",
    "the original insulating antiferromagnetic parent compound lamno@xmath19 becomes a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "this is ascribed to a homogeneous valence mixing ( mn@xmath21mn@xmath22 ) .",
    "the three @xmath23 electrons in mn@xmath13 form a localized @xmath24 moment while the additional @xmath25 electron is itinerant .",
    "again the local moment - itinerant electron correlation is likely responsible for many typical features of the cmr materials .",
    "a model which provides an at least qualitatively correct insight into the physics of the local- moment systems is the kondo - lattice model , which shall now be investigated in detail .",
    "the klm describes interacting local moments ( spins @xmath26 ) and itinerant electrons in a nondegenerate @xmath27-band : @xmath28 @xmath29 creates ( annihilates ) a band electron with spin @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) at the lattice site @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 are the hopping integrals .",
    "the  a priori  uncorrelated electrons are exchange coupled to the local moments , where this coupling is considered an on - site interaction of the electron spin @xmath34 and the localized spin @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath35 is the coupling constant . using second quantization for the electron spin operator",
    "the interaction term reads : @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the first term represents an  ising - type  interaction while the two others refer to spin exchange processes .",
    "the latter give rise to some of the most typical klm properties .",
    "spin exchange may happen in three different elementary processes : magnon emission by a @xmath38 electron , magnon absorption by a @xmath39 electron and formation of a quasiparticle known as  magnetic polaron  .",
    "the quasiparticle can be understood as a propagating electron dressed by a virtual cloud of magnons corresponding to a polarization of the immediate localized spin neighbourhood .",
    "the sophisticated many - body problem provoked by the klm - hamiltonian ( [ eq : klm ] ) can in general not be solved exactly .",
    "luckily there exists a non - trivial limiting case which is rigorously treatable exhibiting all the just - mentioned important elementary exchange processes .",
    "it is the situation of a ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor ( euo at @xmath40 ) , i.  e.  a single electron in an otherwise empty conduction band coupled to a saturated moment system . in this case",
    "the @xmath39 spectrum is extremely simple because the @xmath39 electron has no chance to exchange its spin with the parallel aligned spin system .",
    "only the ising - type interaction in ( [ eq : hsf ] ) takes care for a rigid shift of the spectrum of @xmath41 .",
    "the quasiparticle density of states ( q - dos ) is identical to the free bloch density of states ( b - dos ) , @xmath42 , expect for the trivial shift of @xmath41 . on the contrary ,",
    "real correlation effects make the @xmath38 spectrum highly non - trivial .",
    "[ fig : qdos ] shows the @xmath38-q - bs    .",
    "the degree of blackening in the bandstructure is a measure of the magnitude of the spectral density .",
    "parameters : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , s.c .  lattice .",
    "@xmath45 means the interaction - free bloch - dispersion.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    as density plot of the respective spectral density .",
    "the degree of blackening is a measure for the height of the quasiparticle peak .",
    "rather moderate effective exchange couplings @xmath46 are already sufficient to split the energy dispersion into two branches .",
    "the sharp high - energy one belongs to the magnetic polaron , which has in this case even an infinite lifetime (  bound state  ) .",
    "the low - energy branch is stronger washed out .",
    "it is due to magnon emission by the @xmath38 electron which thereby reverses its spin .",
    "the magnon can carry away any wave vector from the first brillouin zone .",
    "the spectrum (  scattering spectrum  ) is therefore in general rather broad . because of the spinflip it extends over just that energy region where @xmath47 .",
    "surprisingly , however , the broad scattering part is often bunched together to a rather prominent quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "the splitting of the original bloch dispersion into two quasiparticle branches is a typical correlation effect , by no means reproducible by a single - particle theory .      for the general case ( finite temperature , finite band occupations )",
    "the many - body problem of the klm can only be solved approximately .",
    "a common feature of many approaches is the following structure of the conduction electron selfenergy @xcite @xmath48 if restricting to the first term , only , one has the mean - field approach to the klm , which is correct for sufficiently weak couplings @xmath35 .",
    "this part is mainly due to the ising - interaction in ( [ eq : hsf ] ) . without the second term",
    ", it would lead to a spin - polarized splitting of the conduction band ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the more complicated second part contains the spin exchange processes and the polaron formation . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have proposed a moment conserving decoupling approach ( mcda ) for a set of properly defined green functions that correctly reproduces the exactly solvable limiting cases of the klm . for details of the derivation",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "the mcda demonstrates that the selfenergy carries a distinct temperature - dependence which is brought into play by two different types of spin correlations .",
    "there are mixed correlations such as @xmath50 , @xmath51,  built up by combinations of localized - spin and itinerant - electron operators .",
    "luckily all these correlations can be expressed via the spectral theorem by one of the green functions involved in the mcda .",
    "there is no need for further approximations .",
    "the second type of correlations are pure local - moment correlations : @xmath52 , @xmath53,@xmath54,  which need a special treatment .",

    "we calculate the above - mentioned local moment correlations , applying a standard tyablikow - approximation to the heisenberg model @xcite .",

    "the scattering states are clearly visible near the point , while near the r point the magnetic polaron states dominate .",
    "one recognizes that @xmath70 has a low - energy tail , which covers exactly the same energy region as @xmath71 .",
    "this tail consists of scattering states ( magnon emission ! ) which belong to spin - flip excitations of the @xmath38 electron .",
    "such processes are of course possible only when there are @xmath39-states within reach . that explains the coincidence of the low - energy tail of @xmath70 with @xmath71 at low temperatures .    with",
    "increasing temperature , decreasing moment magnetization @xmath72 , more and more magnons are created which can be absorbed by the @xmath39 electron .",

    "q - bs as well as q - dos for @xmath39 and @xmath38 continuously approach each other with increasing @xmath73 , at @xmath0 the spin asymmetry is removed .",

    "the most important entity of ferromagnetism is the curie temperature @xmath0 .",
    "so it is worthwhile to have a look on its dependence on model parameters like band occupation @xmath74 and exchange coupling @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcnj ] ) .",

    "around half - filling ( @xmath75 ) ferromagnetism is excluded .",
    "even more striking and substantially deviating from the conventional rkky picture is the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath0 ( fig .",

    "except for very low electron densities @xmath74 there exist a lower and an upper critical @xmath76 .",
    "finite curie temperatures appear only between these two limits , which in addition are approaching each other with increasing @xmath74 .",

    "on the other hand , the results in fig .  [",
    "fig : tcnj]b do not exclude a reappearance of ferromagnetism for still stronger @xmath35 .",
    "this could not be checked up to now .",
    "according to the general scheme annotated in the introduction we are now going to combine the preceding model study with a first - principles bandstructure calculation in order to investigate the electronic structure of a real ferromagnetic material .",

    "the only difference is that the central equations of the theory now appear in matrix form .",
    "that complicates a little bit the numerical evaluation .",
    "the interesting question is whether or not the correlation effects , worked out for the bulk - klm in sect .",
    "[ sec : klm ] , are decisively influenced by the reduced symmetry of a thin film .",

    "a new feature is the possible appearance of surface states as a consequence of the modified hopping near and within the surface .",
    "that will be inspected in sect .",
    "[ ssec : euofilm ] with respect to a euo ( 100)-film .",
    "to apply our model study to a ferromagnetic euo ( 100 ) film we have first to remove some model simplifications .",
    "the ( empty ) conduction bands of euo have @xmath90 character .",
    "so we have to replace the previous assumption of a non - degenerate @xmath27-band accordingly . instead of ( [ eq : hamil ] ) we write @xmath91 @xmath92 refers to the conduction bands : @xmath93 @xmath94 ,",

    "[ fig : qdosa ] ) .",
    "so we take from the bandstructure calculation the @xmath39 spectrum as input for @xmath92 , thereby elegantly circumventing the double counting of the interband exchange .",
    "we do not avoid the double counting by  switching off  the relevant interaction part , what appears almost impossible , but by exploiting the exact limiting case , for which this interaction part causes only a rigid shift of the @xmath39 spectrum . remember that the @xmath38 spectrum , on the contrary , is influenced by the interband exchange in a drastic manner , even at @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath99 refers to the local moment system ( half - filled @xmath11 shell of the eu@xmath12 ion ) , which we describe by an extended heisenberg hamiltonian : @xmath100 the first term is the original heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ eq : hf ] ) , while the second term introduces a symmetry - breaking single - ion anisotropy being necessary to overcome the mermin - wagner theorem which excludes a collective magnetic order in the isotropic heisenberg model for film geometries at finite temperatures @xcite . because of the empty conduction bands a self - consistent justification of the euo - ferromagnetism via an rkky - type mechanism is not possible . instead of this",
    "we take the experimental values for the exchange integrals between nearest ( @xmath101 ) and next - nearest neighbours ( @xmath102)@xcite ( @xmath103 ) .    the third term in ( [ eq : mklm ] ) describes the on - site coulomb interaction between electrons in different orbitals .",
    "by a straightforward consideration@xcite one finds an interaction operator in strict generalization of ( [ eq : hsf ] ) : @xmath104 although the multiorbital situation complicates once more the numerics of the evaluation , nevertheless one can apply the same many - body concepts , successful for the simple klm ( sect .
