    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; defined as having @xmath8@xmath710@xmath14@xmath6 , @xcite ) are believed to be an important contributor to the global star - formation rate density at @xmath0@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this simple luminosity - cut definition , however , potentially includes a wide range of physical characteristics .",
    "it is particularly poorly understood at the high luminosity ( @xmath8@xmath1@xmath15@xmath16@xmath6 ) end , due to the scarcity of such sources locally . in this regime and above",
    ", most sources are believed to be largely agn - dominated @xcite . however , at @xmath0@xmath12 , sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) fall in the above luminosity range , but appear to be largely starburst - dominated ulirgs @xcite .",
    "although , less numerous , luminous quasars also peak at @xmath0@xmath12 @xcite , and their bolometric luminosities fall in the above luminosity range .",
    "a popular evolutionary scenario suggests that major mergers lead to starburst - like cold ulirgs followed by warm ulirgs as the dust - obscured agn become dominant .",
    "eventually , outflows shed the dusty cocoon to reveal the naked quasar @xcite . due to their mid - ir brightness _",
    "space telescope @xcite selected @xmath0@xmath12 ulirgs , are biased to the ` warm ulirg ' phase @xcite and so fill the gap between smgs and qsos allowing us to test the above scenario directly at the peak epoch for ulirgs and quasars .",
    "if at least a part of the quasars follow a similar evolutionary path we expect to find a population of obscured quasars which are accompanied by strong starburst activity .",
    "recent studies suggest this might indeed be the case @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns a sample of 52 _ spitzer_-selected ulirgs , with infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectra . by selection ,",
    "our sample has somewhat less extreme 24@xmath2m - to - r colors compared with other samples aiming at understanding the _ spitzer_-bright ( @xmath91mjy at 24@xmath2 m ) , optically - faint population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , beside the strong continuum , strong silicate absorption spectra typical of such samples , our sample also includes sources with pah features of comparable strength to those seen in smgs @xcite",
    ". our sample may therefore represent transition objects spanning the range between ( un)obscured quasars and smgs .",
    "this is paperiii of a series of papers on the infrared properties this sample . in (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we presented the spectra , sample selection as well as the irs - derived redshifts . in (",
    "* hereafter paperii ) , we presented the spectral decomposition of the irs spectra into their pah , continuum , and obscuration components .",
    "an _ hst _ nicmos morphology study of the 36 @xmath0@xmath71.5 sources in our sample is presented in @xcite .",
    "that study shows that , typically , the most compact sources are those with agn - like mid - ir spectra ( i.e. weak pah ) and vice versa .",
    "the more intriguing result was the finding that at least some of the interactions leading to ultraluminous activity at @xmath0@xmath12 appear to differ from local ones ( which essentially require equal mass mergers ) .",
    "this result cautions that some of our sources may not have true local analogues . in @xcite , we discussed the fact that 40% of our @xmath0@xmath71.6 sources with optical depths of @xmath17@xmath71 are radio loud , including some sources with powerful radio jets . since deep silicate feature sources are particularly prone to power source ambiguities ( due to the heavy obscuration ) , this result was crucial in confirming that a significant fraction of these sources do indeed host powerful agn .",
    "lastly , the _ chandra _ x - ray detectability of our sources is addressed in bauer et al .",
    "( 2008 , in prep . ) .",
    "there are however key questions about the nature of these sources which remain unanswered after the above studies , and are the subject of this paper .",
    "given the uncertainties inherent in the mid - ir diagnostics ( see paperii ) , can we confirm the presence of obscured agn in our sources , and if present , are they of quasar - like strength ?",
    "what is the bolometric power output of our sources , and what fraction of that is due to agn vs. star - formation activity ?    this paper is organized as follows .",

    "* ) 70@xmath2 m and 160@xmath2 m , and mambo1.2 mm pointed photometry , as well as the archival vla 1.4ghz , and gmrt 610mhz data .",
    "our analysis of the above data is presented in  3 , where we look for the signature of agn activity via their radio properties ( luminosity and spectral index ) as well as traditional optical line diagnostics ( broad lines , high ionization lines , and agn - like line ratios ) .",
    "we use spectral decomposition to determine the role of agn and starburst activity in powering the bolometric output of our sources . in  4 , we use all of the above diagnostics to address the question how do our sources relate to other high-@xmath0 luminous populations such as smgs and in particular whether or not they form part of the population of obscured quasars as we speculated in paperi .",
    "finally , we summarize the key results of this work in  5 . throughout this paper , we adopt a @xmath18cdm model with @xmath19=0.27 , @xmath20=0.73 , and @xmath21=71@xmath22 @xcite .",

    "the irs low resolution data revealed that 47 of the targets have measurable redshifts from the features detected in their mid - ir spectra , with the majority ( 35/47=74% ) at 1.5@xmath24@xmath0@xmath243.2 , and a smaller fraction ( 12/47=28% ) at 0.65@xmath24@xmath0@xmath241.5 . an additional source ( mips279 )",

    "most of our spectra cover rest - frame @xmath1515@xmath2 m  with a minimum signal - to - noise per pixel of 4 . because the primary selection is the 24@xmath2 m  flux , we name our sources based on their mips24@xmath2 m  catalogue number ( see table  [ table_long ] for a source list and redshifts ) .    in paperii",
    ", we presented the decomposition of the rest - frame @xmath1515@xmath2 m  mid - ir spectra into pah , continuum , and obscuration components .",

    "we adopt these definitions throughout this paper as well . in paperii",
    ", we found that @xmath175% of the sample are weak - pah sources consistent with agn - dominance in the mid - ir .",
    "however , although of comparable luminosities , these sources are more obscured than typical quasars as evidenced by their steeper slopes , and typically significant 9.7@xmath2 m  silicate absorption .",
    "although most of our strong - pah ( starburst - like ) sources were found among the lower-@xmath0 sub - sample , we found an intriguing population of these star - forming sources at @xmath0@xmath12 with luminosities an order of magnitude larger than local ulirg analogues .",
    "we obtained optical spectra for 12 of our sources using the lris and deimos instruments on the keck telescopes @xcite .",
    "the initial results from the optical and near - ir spectroscopy ( see below ) were presented in paperi @xcite . for the red side of the lris spectrograph , he d680 dichroic was used , splitting the red and blue arms at 6800 .",

    "the slit width is @xmath26 and we dithered the targets along the slits between exposures with offsets of 24@xmath27 .",
    "the integration time for each exposure was 1200seconds , with a total time per mask of 11.5hours .",
    "the deimos observations were made using a 1200 line mm@xmath25 grating with central wavelength settings of 7400  and 7699  together with the gg495 blocking filter , resulting in a 0.33  pix@xmath25 mean spectral dispersion and a 1.45  instrumental resolution .",

    ", we used the deep2 spec2d data reduction pipeline , which performs cosmic ray removal , flat - fielding , co - addition , sky subtraction , wavelength calibration and both 2-d and 1-d spectral extraction .",
    "we obtained near - ir @xmath28 and @xmath29 spectra using the nirspec instrument on keck @xcite .",
    "additional three nights with the niri instrument @xcite on the gemini - north telescope were used to obtain near - ir @xmath28 and @xmath29-band spectra of our sample targets at @xmath30 .",

    "the nirspec data reduction was done using idl software written by george becker ( private communication ) .",
    "this software uses the methods of optimal sky subtraction @xcite for reducing longslit spectra in the near - infrared , where the strong oh emission lines can hide the faint spectral features of our source sample .",
    "this method models and removes sky emission without first rectifying or rebinning the data , which eliminates noise and edge effects that can occur during interpolation .",
    "the spectra are wavelength calibrated using the sky emission lines .",
    "standard f and g stars were observed in order to perform flux calibrations and to remove atmospheric absorption features .",
    "the absolute standard fluxes were obtained from the irtf spectral library using the spectral type closest to that of our standards .",
    "the maximum air mass difference between our source observations and the standard star observations is @xmath10.2 .",
    "given the average values of sky extinction on mauna kea , which are 0.05mag / airmass , and 0.07mag / airmass in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 band respectively @xcite , this airmass difference does not significantly affect our flux calibration .",
    "the aforementioned idl code for longslit reductions does not currently accept niri data , so we performed the spectroscopic reductions on the niri data using the gemini iraf package gnirs and the instrument - specific niri package , following the data reduction procedures outlined on the gemini observatory webpages .",
    "the flux calibration followed a similar procedure as for nirspec .",
    "the spectra were extracted using a gaussian profile with fwhm of 4pixels for nirspec and 8pixels for niri , appropriate for spatially unresolved sources .",
    "lastly , the absolute flux correction is uncertain due to the uncertain positioning of the standard sources on the slits and possible light loss ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to estimate the degree of uncertainty in the absolute fluxes , we compare with expectations from the nicmos broadband photometry @xcite .",
    "this is complicated for most of our sources due to the non - detection of the continuum .",
    "the only exception is mips8196 ( observed with niri ) , which is brighter than the rest of our sources ( @xmath37=18.68 ) .",
    "we find that , convolving its spectrum with the nicmos f160w transmission curve results in a flux 1.6 times the observed .",
    "this sources also has a @xmath29-band magnitude from the wide field ir camera ( wirc ) , of @xmath38=17.63 ( p.choi , private communication ) .",
    "our @xmath29-band spectrum results in a wirc flux a factor of 1.9 higher than the observed .",
    "this shows that the absolute flux calibration of our sources is likely overestimated by roughly 50100% .",
    "however , as we can not confidently determine these overestimation factors for any other sources ( both nirspec and niri ) , we choose not to apply this correction factors , but merely state that the line luminosities we derive from these spectra (  [ sec_lineratios ] and table  [ table_keck ] ) are uncertain up to a factor of 2 ( 0.3dex ) .",
    "the xfls was observed in scan map mode with the mips70@xmath2 m  array @xcite .",
    "a smaller , 0.25 sq.deg .",
    ", verification field was imaged with 4 times the integration time as the main xfls field .",
    "the noise is non - uniform across the field , however the average point source ( 1@xmath39 ) rms at 70@xmath2 m   is @xmath12.8mjy in the main field , and @xmath11.6mjy in the verification field .",
    "three of our sources fall inside the verification field ( mips15977 , mips8268 , mips8245 ) . for the sources without clear 70@xmath2 m  detection in the scan map data , additional pointed photometry data was obtained as part of _ spitzer _ go2 program # 20239 ( pi : p.choi ) .",
    "most of our targets have roughly 700 seconds integration time per pixel .",
    "the scan map data and pointed photometry data were combined into a local median - subtracted image with 4  pixel scale .",
    "the fluxes and their uncertainties are estimated from prf photometry on the median - subtracted image ( using apex ; * ? ? ?",
    "for color corrections , we use the values for flat spectrum ( @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42 ) , which is also roughly consistent with the color corrections for dust temperatures in the range 3070k .",
    "this implies a color correction of 1.09 for mips70@xmath2 m , and 1.04 for mips160@xmath2m(see below ) .",
    "an additional 5% error in the flux is attributed to the uncertain color correction ( after excluding obviously inconsistent spectral types ) .",

    "the aperture - photometry derived 70@xmath2 m  fluxes for our sample were presented in paperii .",
    "we found that , within the expected uncertainty the prf - derived fluxes presented here and these aperture - photometry derived fluxes agree well , however , that the prf method is somewhat more conservative in that 4 sources with low signal - to - noise detection in paperii ( snr@xmath13 - 3.5 ) were not detected with apex .",

    "the total integration time per pixel is estimated to be @xmath12500sec .",
    "the fluxes and their uncertainties are estimated from prf photometry on the median - subtracted images as in the case of the mips70@xmath2 m  data .",
    "we used a 20  matching radius .",
    "the positional offsets and possibility of random matches are addressed in  [ sec_random ] .",
    "we adopt the latest value of the mips160@xmath2 m  calibration , 41.7mjy / ster @xcite .",
    "the mips160@xmath2 m  calibration is uncertain to @xmath115% . as mentioned in  [ sec_mips70 ]",
    ", we adopt a color correction of 1.04 for mips160@xmath2 m .",
    "an additional 10% correction is needed , since for small field photometry filtering results in an underestimated flux densities ( see mips handbook ) .",
    "we confirm that this is present in our data by comparing the pixel values at the positions of a few of the brightest sources ( including mips15977 , which is detected in both the field map and the photometry data ) .",
    "therefore , all apex - derived fluxes are multiplied by 1.14 , which includes color correction , as well as the above offset .",
    "a total of 9 sources have @xmath73@xmath39 detections ( 1 more has 2.6@xmath39 ) .",
    "including mips22404 , this adds up to 11 sources ( 23% of the sample ) . for the rest",

    "we show the 11 sources with highest signal - to - noise ratio at 160@xmath2 m , where we combined the xfls map @xcite with our photometry data . an important point",
    "we see in figure  [ mosaic_full ] is that in some cases , the shape of the 160@xmath2 m  contours ( e.g. mips289 , mips8184 , mips22404 ) suggests that more than one source contributes significantly .",

    "there are two distinct questions we wish to address here : 1 ) whether or not our sources contain agn and/or starbursts , and 2 ) what is the relative contribution of the two processes to their bolometric power output .",
    "the presence of agn in the bulk of our sample was originally asserted on the basis of their typically low pah equivalent widths , and high 6@xmath2 m  hot dust continuum ( see paperii ) .",
    "conversely , the strong pah emission in a quarter of the sample , and the presence of pah in the stacked spectra of the weak - pah sources suggest that star - formation is likely present in the majority of our sources ( paperii ) .",
    "the presence of agn in many of the weak - pah sources was independently shown on the basis of their agn - like radio luminosities and even , in two cases , radio jets @xcite .    in this section we further test for the presence of starbursts by the detectability of cold ( @xmath5750k ) dust emission typically associated with this process .",
    "we further expand the discussion on the presence of radio agn on the basis of radio luminosities , spectral indices , and the ir - radio correlation .",
    "for a sub - set of the sample with available optical / near - ir spectra , we present optical line diagnostics which could reveal the presence of agn .",
    "finally , we use sed decomposition to estimate the relative contribution of agn and starbursts to @xmath8 . to do so",
    ", we make the simplifying assumption that the cold dust continuum is entirely due to star - formation while the warm / hot dust continuum is entirely due to agn .",
    "the derived starburst component luminosities are the _ sum _ of the cold dust and pah luminosities .",
    "we compare our results from the above analysis with the seds of well known sources and models in order to assess the level of uncertainty in the relative agn / starburst fractions of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we address the questions : how much starburst activity is there in the weak - pah sources and how much agn activity is there is the strong - pah sources ?      typically , the far - ir emission is assumed to arise from star - formation even in quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , for highly obscured agn as is the case with our sources ( see paperii ) , there exists the possibility of dust reprocessing the typically hot / warm sed of an agn into a much cooler starburst - like sed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , before we proceed , we look for trends between the far - ir continuum emission and the pah equivalent widths ( indicative of starburst activity ) and 9.7@xmath2 m  silicate feature optical depth ( @xmath17 ) indicative of obscuration .",
    "as shown in table  [ table_det ] , both the 160@xmath2 m  and 1.2 mm detectability of our sample are rather low ( 21% and 16% respectively ) . however , in both cases , the detectability is higher for the strong - pah vs. weak - pah @xmath0@xmath71.5 sources ( e.g. 50% vs. 11% for the 1.2 mm data ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ cold_origin]_left_. to assess the strength of the perceived trend , we perform a spearman rank correlation .",
    "we find @xmath58=0.569 with probability of correlation of 99.9% .",

    "this suggests that there is a significant trend of strong - pah sources to be strong cold - dust emitters , but no such trends exists with respect to the degree of obscuration as quantified by the depth of the silicate feature .",

    "therefore , the radio undetected 37% of the @xmath0@xmath71.5 sources , as well as the @xmath0@xmath241.5 sources are consistent with the local ir - radio correlation .",
    "a lower @xmath10 than the standard mean value is most commonly but not necessarily associated with excess radio emission due to an agn .",
    "however , purely star - forming galaxies can exhibit infrared - to - radio ratios a few times lower than typical ( @xmath10@xmath12.0 ) in certain environments such as the centers of clusters @xcite , likely as a result of the thermal pressure of the inter cluster medium . in rare cases ,",
    "a merger / interaction can form a synchrotron bridge between the merging pair which leads to lower @xmath10 values as well @xcite .",
    "when considering as yet poorly understood high redshift populations , such effects can not be ruled out .",
    "the agn luminosities we derive based on our spectral decomposition ( @xmath114=@xmath115@xmath6 ) place our sample in the quasar regime .",
    "when available , the [ oiii ] luminosities of our sources , imply intrinsic @xmath116@xmath910@xmath117erg / s , supporting this conclusion . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec_agnsed ] and  [ sec_sbsed ] , our sed decomposition ( especially for strong - pah sources ) is uncertain .",
    "in particular , starburst - powered mid - ir continua have been observed both in conjunction with strong pah ( e.g. m82 ) and weak - pah , but strong si features ( e.g. ngc1377 ; roussel et al .",
    "the presence of either an optical or a radio agn , however is independently supported for at least 20/35 ( 57% ) of our @xmath0@xmath71.5 sample ( see table  [ table_fits ] ) .",
    "these include both strong - pah and weak - pah sources .",
    "although , this does not prove the agn - origin of their mid - ir continua , it does make it the most likely explanation .",
    "we therefore , conclude that _ at least _ 57% of our higher-@xmath0 sample",
    "are consistent with hosting obscured quasars , although this fraction can be as high as 100% .",
    "the optical faintness , red infrared colors and frequent deep silicate absorption all suggests high degrees of obscuration .",
    "two sources with silicate absorption do not show optical extinction in their h@xmath36/h@xmath69 ratios suggesting perhaps an obscured nucleus surrounded by an unobscured host galaxy . in @xcite , we argued that ( the radio - loud ) of these sources might be transition objects just before feedback effects dispel the obscuring matter and reveal the naked quasar .",
    "some tentative evidence of such processes are seen in the blue - shifted [ oiii ] emission of mips15949 and mips16080 , which may indicate outflows of @xmath71=-576km / s and @xmath71=-261km / s respectively .",
    "we find that the number density of our @xmath0@xmath12 sources is @xmath12@xmath4@xmath118mpc@xmath119 .",
    "their mean agn luminosity is @xmath120=12.6@xmath130.2 .",
    "since these sources are optically faint , this luminosity is a close approximation to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the number density of unobscured ( optically and x - ray selected ) quasars of comparable bolometric luminosities at @xmath0@xmath12 is a few@xmath4@xmath118mpc@xmath119 @xcite .",
    "therefore our sources are already comparable in number to the unobscured quasars of the same luminosity and redshift .",
    "the mean redshift of our sample , @xmath0=2.05 , is also consistent with the epoch of peak quasar number density which is estimated at @xmath0@xmath12.15 @xcite . since",
    "our sample is not a complete census of the unobscured quasars at @xmath0@xmath12 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) our results support the finding that obscured quasars at @xmath0@xmath12 are at least as numerous , but likely outnumber the unobscured ones .",
    "lastly , our sample is most likely characterized by sources powered by a combination of starburst and agn activity ( see  [ sec_agnsed ] and  [ sec_sbsed ] ) .",
    "concurrent with the agns are , frequently ulirg - strength starbursts accounting for @xmath13080% of the bolometric emission . these support the conclusion that a significant fraction of these obscured quasars are accompanied by vigorous star - formation activity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown that 6 of our 35 @xmath0@xmath71.6 sources ( 20% ) have @xmath121@xmath72mjy , implying @xmath122@xmath95mjy .",

    "their number density however ( @xmath12/sq.deg . ) is only @xmath12% that of the blank - sky sub - mm population @xcite .",
    "four of these six sources are strong - pah of similar pah strengths as smgs @xcite .",

    "the mid - ir continua of our sources are found to be a higher fraction of their total infrared luminosities than is the case in smgs ( see  [ sec_sbsed ] ) .",
    "our model suggests that this translates into higher agn fractions .",
    "however , as our model assumptions here are uncertain , it is more accurate to say that these are upper limits on the agn fractions .",
    "our spectral decomposition suggests @xmath12030% agn fractions of @xmath8 for the strong - pah sources , while the weak - pah sources have 4079% agn fractions .",
    "@xcite find that the bulk ( 75% ) of smgs host agn ; however , even after absorption - correction the typical @xmath123/@xmath8 for those smgs is about an order of magnitude lower than that of quasars .",

    "this is roughly consistent with the estimates of pope et al .",
    "( 2007 ) based on mid - ir spectral decomposition .",
    "it appears likely that our few mm - bright sources represent the stronger - agn tail of the smg population . particularly intriguing",

    "these types of sources are still rare in our extragalactic samples , yet are clearly crucial in understanding any evolutionary links between starburst - dominated and agn - dominated ulirgs / obscured quasars .",
    "such sources are likely to be detected in larger numbers in upcoming wide - field sub - mm surveys such as expected from scuba2 @xcite , when combined with large - area mid - ir surveys such as swire @xcite .",
    "\\1 ) our sample shows low detectability in the far - ir ( 23% at 160@xmath2 m , and 16% at 1.2 mm ) . for the @xmath0@xmath71.5 bulk of this sample",
    ", there is a trend of increasing mambo1.2 mm fluxes with increasing pah equivalent widths , but no clear trend with increasing 9.7@xmath2 m  silicate absorption .",
    "+ 2 ) by contrast 67% of the sample are radio - detected .",
    "based on their radio luminosities and/or spectral indices , we conclude the 17/35 ( 48% ) of our @xmath0@xmath71.5 sources host radio agn ( about half of these are radio - loud ) .",
    "this is supported by the observations of an enhanced radio emission for a given @xmath8 compared with expectations of the local ir - radio correlation . excluding radio - loud sources , and accounting for the radio - undetected sources ( through survival analysis ) , we estimate @xmath111=2.07@xmath130.01 , which is significantly below the mean value ( @xmath10=2.34 ) estimated locally .",

    "we find a good correspondence between the mid - ir and optical diagnostics in that only 10% of the strong - pah sources show signs of optical agn versus 62% of the weak - pah sources with optical / near - ir spectra .",

    "the optical spectra of four of our sources show the civ emission line with widths corresponding to the nlr .",
    "+ 5 ) evidence for blueshifted [ oiii ] emission is seen in two of our @xmath0@xmath12 weak - pah sources .",

    ", we find dust masses of @xmath15@xmath4@xmath105@xmath81 , consistent with the values for sub - mm galaxies .",
    "this suggests that these sources have comparable gas reservoirs to smgs and hence are capable of sustaining the sfr@xmath1900@xmath81/yr implied by their agn - subtracted infrared luminosities .",
    "+ 10 ) finally , the presence of an agn is confirmed through radio or optical line diagnostics in 57% of the 35 @xmath0@xmath71.5 sources .",
    "this is a lower limit on the presence of agn , because most agn are not radio - loud , less than half our sources have optical / near - ir spectra and due to the high obscurations and composite nature of our sources an agn may not be obvious in our optical spectra .",
    "the infrared , radio , and optical spectroscopic diagnostics all support the conclusion that agn contribute in the majority of these sources ; however , predominantly we have composite starburst - agn systems .",
