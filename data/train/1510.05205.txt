    "caching has been widely used in wired networks such as fixed line p2p systems @xcite and content distribution networks ( cdn ) @xcite .",
    "one key difference between wireless and wired networks is that the performance of wireless networks is fundamentally limited by the interference .",

    "a proactive caching paradigm was proposed in @xcite to exploit both the spatial and social structure of the wireless networks .",
    "@xcite studied the joint optimization of cache content replication and routing in a _",
    "regular network _ and identified the throughput scaling laws for various regimes .",
    "recently , a number of works have studied the fundamental tradeoff or scaling laws in wireless device - to - device ( d2d ) caching networks @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated the fundamental limits of distributed caching in d2d wireless networks and the combined effect of coded multicast gain and spatial reuse .",

    "@xcite presented a tutorial for the schemes and the recent results on the throughput scaling laws of d2d caching networks .",
    "a stochastic geometry framework , which incorporates the effects of random distributed users , user clustering , fading channel and interference , was proposed in @xcite to study the tradeoff between the fraction of video requests served through d2d and the average rate .",

    ", we consider both the effect of phy channel model and the coupling between caching and phy transmission ( e.g. , the phy transmission modes in our design depend on the cache mode of the requested file ) .",
    "note that the concept of cached - induced opportunistic comp was first introduced in our previous works @xcite for cellular networks .",
    "however , the cached - induced opportunistic comp schemes in @xcite can not be directly applied to wireless adhoc networks where a node may serve both as a transmitter that provides content and a receiver that requests content . as a result",
    ", we propose a new cache - induced _ dual - layer _ comp to support cached - induced opportunistic comp in wireless adhoc networks . to the best of our knowledge , a complete understanding of the role of caching in wireless networks is still missing , especially for the inter - play between the cache - assisted multihop gain and the cache - induced comp gains .",

    "we also analyze the performance of a baseline _ multihop caching scheme _ which only achieves cache - assisted multihop gain .",

    "the size of the @xmath11-th file is @xmath12 bits and we assume @xmath13 .",
    "there are two phases during the operation of cache - assisted wireless adhoc network , namely the _ cache initialization phase _ and the _ content delivery phase_.    in the cache initialization phase , each node caches a portion of @xmath14 ( possibly encoded ) bits of the @xmath11-th content file ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16^{t}$ ] ( with @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 ) are called _ cache content replication vector_. the specific cache data structure at each node and the algorithm to find @xmath19 will be elaborated in section [ sub : mds - cache - encoding ] and section [ sec : scaling - laws - of ] , respectively .",
    "since the popularity of content files change very slowly ( e.g. , new movies are usually posted on a weekly or monthly timescale ) , the cache update overhead in the cache initialization phase is usually small @xcite .",

    "* * however , the impact of cache initialization phase is worthy of further investigation , especially for the case when the popularity of content files changes more frequently .    in the content delivery phase ,",

    "the cache - assisted multihopping and cache - induced dual - layer comp have conflicting requirements on the caching scheme . for the former ,",
    "it is better to cache different content at different nodes so that the number of hops from the source to destination nodes can be minimized .",

    "we propose an _ mds cache encoding scheme _ to strike a balance between these two conflicting goals .",
