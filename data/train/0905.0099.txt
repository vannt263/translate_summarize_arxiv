    "the su(2 ) skyrme model provides a geometrical picture of nuclear physics in which nuclei are identified with the topological soliton solutions of the model , known as skyrmions @xcite .",
    "the model has several advantages over conventional nuclear models .",
    "firstly , single skyrmions , which are identified with nucleons , are found to merge to some extent and to lose their individual identities in the solutions describing larger nuclei .",
    "this captures an important feature of nuclei with individual nucleons close together , and is something that can not be achieved in conventional point nucleon models .",
    "secondly , the skyrme lagrangian is defined in terms of only three parameters . for each mass number",
    "@xmath1 we fit these parameters to the mass and size of the nucleus of zero isospin that has mass number @xmath1 , to obtain predictions with reasonable quantitative accuracy .",
    "this is unlike potential and shell model calculations which require many finely tuned parameters .",
    "the model is a pion field theory , and is an extension of the nonlinear sigma model .",
    "the pion fields @xmath2 are combined into an su(2)-valued scalar field , the skyrme field @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the triplet of pauli matrices and @xmath5 .",
    "the lagrangian density is @xcite @xmath6[\\partial^\\mu u u^{\\dag } , \\partial^\\nu u u^{\\dag } ] + \\frac{1}{8 } m_\\pi ^2 f_\\pi^2\\,\\hbox{tr}\\,(u-1_2 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the pion decay constant , @xmath8 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath9 is the pion mass . using energy and length units of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , the skyrme lagrangian can be rewritten as @xmath12[r^\\mu , r^\\nu ] )   + m^2\\,\\hbox{tr}\\,(u - 1_2 ) \\right\\ } d^3 x \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , and the dimensionless pion mass @xmath14 . as usual ,",
    "the lagrangian splits into kinetic and potential parts as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 quadratic in the time derivative of the skyrme field .",
    "the potential energy @xmath17 is given by @xmath18[r_i , r_j])-\\ , m^2\\hbox{tr}(u-1_2)\\right\\}d^3x\\,.\\ ] ] the skyrmions are minima of the potential energy and are static .",
    "they are labelled by their topological charge , @xmath1 , the degree of the map @xmath19 , which is well - defined provided @xmath20 at spatial infinity , and is given by the integral @xmath21 where @xmath22 we denote the minimised potential energy by @xmath23 .",
    "one interprets a charge @xmath1 skyrmion , after quantization , as a nucleus of mass number @xmath1 . in this picture ,",
    "nucleons and nuclei arise purely from the pion field and no explicit nucleonic sources are needed .",
    "it is necessary to semiclassically quantize the skyrmions as rigid bodies .",
    "the skyrme lagrangian is invariant under rotations in space .",
    "it is also invariant under the transformations @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "this is isospin symmetry .",
    "the rotational and isorotational degrees of freedom are treated as collective coordinates and the skyrmions are quantized in their rest frame by canonical methods . in this way",
    "the skyrmions acquire spin and isospin .",
    "an advantage of this model over other nuclear models that involve collective rotational motion is that it incorporates isospin excitations . in the skyrme model ,",
    "the vacuum solution @xmath26 is isospin invariant , but for each classical skyrmion solution , isospin symmetry as well as rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "these symmetries are restored by the collective coordinate quantization .",
    "the kinetic energy of a rigidly rotating skyrmion ( ignoring the rather trivial translational motion ) is of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the angular velocities in space and isospace respectively , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are inertia tensors @xcite .",
    "the momenta conjugate to @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the body - fixed spin and isospin operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian @xmath35 is obtained by re - expressing @xmath16 in terms of these operators .",
    "the space - fixed spin and isospin operators are denoted @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "finkelstein and rubinstein showed that it is possible to quantize a @xmath40 skyrmion as a fermion , and showed that for even ( odd ) @xmath1 the spin and isospin are integers ( half - integers ) @xcite .",
    "discrete symmetries of the classical skyrmion solutions and @xmath41 skyrmions possess continuous symmetries . ]",
    "give rise to further finkelstein  rubinstein ( fr ) constraints on the space of quantum states @xmath42 .",
    "these constraints are of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are , respectively , the axes and angles defining the rotations in isospace and space associated with a particular symmetry , and @xmath48 .",
    "the fr signs , @xmath49 , define a one - dimensional representation of the symmetry group of the skyrmion .",
    "krusch has found a convenient way to calculate them @xcite , and we use this method here .",
    "a basis for the wave functions @xmath42 is given by the products @xmath50 , the tensor products of states for a rigid body in space and a rigid body in isospace .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are the total spin and isospin quantum numbers , @xmath53 and @xmath54 the projections on to the third body - fixed axes , and the space projection labels ( which are the physical third components of spin and isospin ) are suppressed .",
    "the fr constraints only allow a subset of these products as physical states .",
    "a parity operator is introduced by considering a skyrmion s reflection symmetries .",
    "quantum states are therefore labelled by the usual quantum numbers : spin - parity @xmath55 and isospin @xmath52 .",
    "the inclusion of the third term in the lagrangian density , which involves the pion mass , has a significant effect on the shapes and symmetries of the classical skyrmion solutions .",
    "this effect is more marked for larger values of @xmath1 . for zero pion mass ,",
    "the skyrmions with @xmath1 up to 22 and beyond resemble hollow polyhedra , with their baryon density concentrated in a shell of roughly constant thickness , surrounding a region in which the baryon density is very small @xcite .",
    "this disagrees with the approximately uniform baryon density observed in the interior of real nuclei .",
    "fortunately , it has been established that the hollow polyhedral solutions for @xmath56 do not remain stable when the pion mass is set at a physically reasonable value , with @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this is because in the interior of the hollow polyhedra the skyrme field is very close to @xmath58 , and here the pion mass term gives the field a maximal potential energy , and hence instability .",
    "this instability results in the interior region splitting into separate smaller subregions .",
    "the stable skyrmion solutions are found to exhibit clustering : small skyrmion solutions , such as the cubically symmetric @xmath0 solution , appear as substructures within larger solutions @xcite .",
    "this is a very encouraging development as it has been believed for some time that alpha - particles exist as stable substructures inside heavier nuclei .",
    "the most remarkable success of the alpha - particle model is in its prediction for the binding energies of nuclei which can be formed out of an integral number of alpha - particles .    in earlier work , the @xmath0 ,",
    "6 and 8 skyrmions have been quantized @xcite , using some approximations to the skyrmion solutions based on the rational map ansatz @xcite .",
    "the inertia tensors used had the right symmetries , but not the correct numerical values . in this paper",
    "we consider the @xmath0 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 skyrmions , using a consistent numerical scheme to recalculate all these solutions .",
    "each of these skyrmions can be viewed as being built up from @xmath0 cubes ( it is possible to regard the @xmath59 skyrmion as being made up of a @xmath0 cube and a @xmath41 torus , and the @xmath60 solution as consisting of two @xmath0 cubes together with two @xmath40 skyrmions ) .",
    "we numerically relax field configurations to the stable skyrmions , for various values of the dimensionless pion mass @xmath61 , and then compute their static energies @xmath23 , charge radii @xmath62 , and inertia tensors .",
    "appendix a tabulates the calculated numerical values for @xmath63 , 1 and 1.5 , and describes the quadratic interpolation method used to estimate these quantities for any given @xmath61 . in the next section we describe our method of choosing @xmath61 and of calibrating the model to ensure that it provides quantitatively accurate predictions of nuclear properties .",
    "for each skyrmion we determine all the fr - allowed quantum states and their excitation energies , working up to spin and isospin values just beyond the edge of what is experimentally accessible .",
    "our rigid - body quantization leads to an infinite tower of quantum states ( the @xmath40 skyrmion , for example , has quantum states for all half - integer values of spin ) .",
    "however , in practice we expect a skyrmion to deform as it spins ( this is known to occur for the @xmath40 skyrmion @xcite ) , and this disallows many higher spin states .",
    "we are therefore not concerned that in some cases we predict higher spin states that are not experimentally observed .",
    "it is also possible that a skyrmion might break up as it spins , a phenomenon that is known to occur for real nuclei .",
    "the model was first calibrated by adkins , nappi and witten , by fitting the model in the @xmath40 sector to the masses of the proton and delta resonance @xcite . in a recent paper a new calibration",
    "was obtained by equating the mass and size of the quantized @xmath59 skyrmion to the mass and size of the lithium-6 nucleus @xcite .",
    "however this was performed using the approximate skyrmion found using the rational map ansatz .",
    "evidently , there are many possible ways in which the model may be calibrated .",
    "the three parameters of the model are the pion decay constant @xmath7 ( experimentally @xmath64 ) , the pion mass @xmath9 ( experimentally @xmath65 ) , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 . strictly speaking",
    ", one may argue that we are only free to set @xmath8 , as the other constants are fixed by experiment .",
    "however , we consider it permissible to vary @xmath7 , as we consider it to be a renormalised pion decay constant .",
    "we also allow @xmath8 to vary with mass number , @xmath66 , in order to get better agreement with experiment .",
    "the length and classical energy scales are @xmath11 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "we recall that the quantum hamiltonian for a rigidly rotating body is equal to the squared angular momentum operator divided by twice the moment of inertia of the body @xcite .",
    "the moment of inertia has units equal to the mass scale multiplied by the square of the length scale : @xmath68 .",
    "the quantum energy scale is its reciprocal , @xmath69 .",
    "the total energy of a quantum state of a skyrmion is therefore equal to @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the quantum kinetic energy of the state .",
    "the ratio of the total energy of a quantum state to the classical energy of the skyrmion is @xmath72 .",
    "the ratios of the quantum energies of skyrmion states are therefore sensitive to the value of @xmath8 .",
    "the classical skyrmion solutions match the experimental pion tails of nuclei if we use the physical value of @xmath9 of 138mev .",
    "for this reason , we keep @xmath9 fixed at this value . for each @xmath1",
    ", we choose @xmath61 ( and therefore fix the length scale , as @xmath14 ) such that the calculated mean charge radius agrees with that of the nucleus with zero isospin with this value of @xmath1 . within the skyrme model , the mean charge radius of a nucleus with zero isospin",
    "is estimated to be the square root of @xmath73 since the electric charge density is half the baryon density @xcite .",
    "we then set the classical energy scale such that the skyrmion mass agrees with the nuclear mass , which is done by setting @xmath67 to be the nuclear mass divided by @xmath23 .",
    "we use the actual nuclear masses , not taking into account small quantum energies which are of the order of 0.1% of the nuclear mass and @xmath74 respectively ) .",
    "we calculate the energy of the @xmath75 state of the @xmath59 skyrmion to be 1.6mev ( see section 4 ) , which is negligible compared to the mass of lithium-6 , 5601mev .",
    "an estimate of the boron-10 mass with its quantum energy removed can be obtained by taking the average of the masses of beryllium-10 and carbon-10 and subtracting from this our estimate of the @xmath76 state with isospin 1 , 10.4mev ( see section 6 ) .",
    "this yields a value of 9319mev , which is very close to the accepted mass of boron-10 , 9327mev . ] .",
    "it is found that in each case @xmath61 takes a value between 0.6 and 1.2 .",
    "the experimental data , the values of @xmath61 used , and the length and energy scales are listed in table 1 .        to obtain approximations to the inertia tensors , static energies and mean charge radii for a given value of @xmath61 , we use the method of quadratic interpolation between three points . we know",
    "the values of a property @xmath77 at @xmath63 , 1 and 1.5 , and we make the ansatz @xmath78 let @xmath79 . the vector @xmath80 is obtained by inverting the expression @xmath81 where @xmath82 the interpolated values are given in the right - hand columns of the tables in appendices a.1 to a.5 ."
