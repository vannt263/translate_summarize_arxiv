    "since @xmath359 satisfies the leibniz rule , @xmath360 is homologous to @xmath361 since by definition @xmath362 ( @xmath363 ) and @xmath339 , @xmath364        @xmath368 also admits @xmath365 defined as a `` separation '' of the graphs by removing a point from the specified oriented line ( see @xcite ) . theorem  6.3 of @xcite shows , without using @xmath12 , that @xmath369 if @xmath19 satisfies @xmath101 .",
    "fix @xmath215 and regard @xmath383 as an invariant @xmath384 of @xmath182 .",
    "we choose two crossings @xmath256 and @xmath259 from the diagram of @xmath182 in @xmath178-plane , and compute @xmath385 in the limit @xmath251 as in  [ ss : gramain ] .",

    "this will complete the proof .",
    "we will compute each @xmath388 ( @xmath389 ) in the limit @xmath251 .",
    "the two observations appearing in the proof of lemma  [ lem:13 - 24 ] allow us to conclude @xmath390 for @xmath391 in the same way as before , so we compute @xmath392 for @xmath304 below .",
