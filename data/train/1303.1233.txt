    "in recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in the interface between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics @xcite , macro and nano / micro @xcite , leading to a thorough reexamination of the basic concepts and principles of thermodynamics with ramifications in biological processes and soft condensed matter systems .",
    "new paradigms for notions of work , thermal machines etc . have emerged that provide deep insights into thermodynamics which in turn help enlarge its scope far beyond that envisaged originally and open up new possibilities @xcite .",
    "these developments force one to formulate questions concerning efficiencies of various heat engines using appropriate microscopic considerations @xcite .",
    "indeed , one has even started considering quantum heat engines which in principle have efficiency larger than carnot efficiency though such cases require non equilibrium steady states .",
    "such steady states can be reached via the use of the coherent laser fields or via quantum interference effects @xcite-@xcite . in a very recent",
    "experiment @xcite realized a microscopic brownian heat engine @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most important ingredient both in the work of blickle and bechinger @xcite as well as in the proposals of scully and collaborators @xcite is the possibility that all the relevant parametrs can be very well controlled experimentally and thus the heat engine cycle can be precisely realized and it becomes desirable to have exactly soluble models of microscopic heat engines .    in view of the way the experiments are carried out we need a fully dynamical model which should account for the way the system parameters like potentials or the external parameters like temperature are changed .",
    "further the behavior of the engine should depend on various time scales foe example the time taken to reach equilibrium state .",
    "such a time would depend on the scales of the damping in the system .",
    "motivated by these requirements we develop in the present work an exactly soluble model of a microscopic brownian heat engine .",
    "the model that we present is fully quantum mechanical .",
    "our model enables us to examine many different possible experimental scenarios- ( a ) low temperature behavior where quantum effects are likely to dominate , ( b ) behavior under different relaxation conditions - for example the system could be underdamped or overdamped , ( c ) possibilities for the system to pass through nonequilibrium stages depending on the rate of change of the external parameters , ( d ) nonequilibrium conditions because the experimental time scales are smaller than the time it takes for the system to reach steady state .",
    "our formulation is based on the wigner function and quantum langevin equations for an harmonic oscillator whose frequency is modulated in time .",
    "we also assume that the temperature of the environment is time dependent as well .",
    "these time dependences are needed to implement the heat engine cycle realistically .",
    "we calculate the time dependent wigner function , all the fluctuation parameters and the entropy .",
    "these enable us to calculate thermodynamic quantities like work , heat and internal energy .    a brief outline of the work is as follows . in section",
    "ii for later reference we briefly recapitualate the expressions for the efficiencies , both classical as well as quantum , for the three engines based on standard thermodynamic considerations with usual assumptions regarding the speed with which the various steps are carried out . in section",
    "iii we present a qua ntum thermodynamic frame work based on wigner phase space description for quantum systems which contains the classical framework as a limiting case . in section iv we develop a general set up for computing various quantitities of interest and give two models of frequency modulation where the relevant equations are amenable to exact analytical results . in section",
    "v we consider the situation when the diffusion constant is varied linearly and in section vi analyse its ramifications on the efficiencies of brownian heat engines . in section vii",
    "we develop a systematic scheme for computing finite time corrections to the efficiencies of classical and quantum brownian motors and then use these results in section vii to examine the role they play in determining the efficiency of the stirling engine at maximum power .",
    "section ix contains our concluding remarks and further outlook .    as noted above our working model for a heat engine",
    "is based on a quantum harmonic oscillator with a frequency @xmath0 interacting with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "three typical engines that have been discussed extensively in the literature based on varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 appropriately are ( a ) the stirling ( b ) carnot and ( c ) otto engines . their cycles adapted to the harmonic oscillator model are schematically given below : * stirling engine *  @xcite @xmath2    * carnot engine *  @xcite,@xcite @xmath3    * otto engine *",
    "@xcite @xmath4 here , the @xmath5 s indicate the time taken to carry out the indicated step and @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 .",
    "the calculations that we give in subsequent sections can be applied to any of these engines .",
    "the three prototype engines above thus involve suitable combinations of the following three steps :  ( a ) isothermal i.e. @xmath0 changing , @xmath1 fixed or ( b ) isochoric i.e. @xmath0 held fixed , @xmath1 changing or ( c ) isentropic i.e both @xmath0 and @xmath1 changing with @xmath8 fixed and one needs an appropriate formalism to compute the efficiencies under specific physical circumstances in which these steps are actually executed in an experiment .",
    "the present work has this as its major objective .",
    "our principal results include ( i ) development of a self contained formalism for computing efficiencies of brownian engines both in the classical as well as quantum conexts ( ii ) an exact analysis of the role of damping in the process of coupling the system to a bath at a higher temperature and its influence on the performance of the stirling engine ( iii ) computation of the irreversible heat in isothermal processes and the derivation of complementarity relations ( iv ) a detailed analysis of the role of damping as well as finite time corrections on the efficiency of the stirling engine at maximum power .",
    "to set the notation and for later reference we assemble here the standard thermodynamic considerations that enable us to compute the efficiencies for the three engines listed above both in classical and as well as in the quantum contexts .",
    "these are :      with this preparation we now proceed to compute the efficiencies of the three engines mentioned earlier both in the classical as well as quantum cases .",
    "these would then be compared with the results obtained from the microscopic theory developed later .",
    "the efficiency @xmath26 of the stirling engine is defined as @xmath27 * classical *    in the classical case the work done by the engine is given by @xmath28-[f(\\omega_2,t_c)-f(\\omega_1,t_c)]\\nonumber\\\\ & = k_b(t_h - t_c)\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the heat absorbed at @xmath29 by @xmath30 + 0+\\dfrac{1}{2}(\\dfrac{1}{\\beta_h}-\\dfrac{1}{\\beta_c})\\nonumber\\\\ & = k_bt_h\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}\\right)+\\dfrac{1}{2 } k_b(t_h - t_c ) .",

    "we will return to this later .",
    "] hence @xmath31 * quantum *    proceeding as before and using the expressions for @xmath11 and @xmath17 appropriate to the quantum case , we have for the work done @xmath28-[f(\\omega_2,t_c)-f(\\omega_1,t_c)],\\nonumber\\\\ & = k_bt_h \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{\\sinh(\\beta_h\\hbar\\omega_2/2)}{\\sinh(\\beta_h\\hbar\\omega_1/2)}\\right )        -k_bt_c\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{\\sinh(\\beta_c\\hbar\\omega_2/2)}{\\sinh(\\beta_c\\hbar\\omega_1/2)}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the heat absorbed at @xmath29 @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\&+[\\hbar\\omega_1(n(\\omega_1,t_h)+1/2 ) -\\hbar\\omega_2(n(\\omega_2,t_h)+1/2)]\\nonumber\\\\&+\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left([\\hbar\\omega_2(n(\\omega_2,t_h)+1/2 ) ] -[\\hbar\\omega_2(n(\\omega_2,t_c)+1/2)]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence @xmath33.\\nonumber \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath34 @xmath35 goes over to the classical efficiency @xmath36 as expected .      for the carnot engine the efficiency defined as before @xmath37 turns out to be the same in both classical and quantum cases and",
    "is given by @xmath38      here again the efficiency defined as @xmath39 turns out to be the same in both quantum and classical cases and is given by @xmath40 the expressions for efficiencies for the the three engines , realized here through a harmonic oscillator by appropriate changes of its frequency ( or equivalently its ` spring constant ' ) and the ambient temperature , hold for idealized operating conditions as stipulated in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "these , for instance , demand that the isothermal changes of frquency involved in the stiring or the carnot cycles be carried out quasistatically i.e. so slowly that at each instance the oscillator remains in the state of equilibrium at that temperature and frequency .",
    "such conditions are hardly ever met in practice and particularly in the light of the experimental work reported in @xcite there is an obvious need for developing a framework which brings into play aspects of approach to equilibrium , both in classical and quantum contexts , and is capable of furnishing a self - contained scheme for computing the efficiencies under realistic conditions .",
    "we develop such a scheme in the next section .",
    "for reasons given later it proves expedient to transcribe the quantum dynamics described by the master equation using the wigner phase space description of quantum systems @xcite,@xcite which associates with a density operator @xmath45 a phase space function @xmath46 of classical variables @xmath47 as follows : @xmath48    we note here that we use the wigner phase space description in preference to other phase space descriptions for two reasons : ( a ) it is the only one that that maps the quantum mechanical average of a product of two operators to the phase space average of the corresponding wigner functions ( b ) its moments @xmath49 correspond to quantum averages of of the symmetrised operator @xmath50 .",
    "for example @xmath51 corresponds to the expectation value of the operator @xmath52 .",
    "use of the wigner description turns the master equation into a fokker - planck equation for @xmath46 @xcite @xmath53w(q , p , t ) , \\nonumber\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the following the parameter @xmath56 , the ` spring constant ' , will be taken to be controlled externally .",
    "the langevin equations equivalent to the above fpe read : @xmath57 the langevin equations @xmath58   lend themselves to a nice thermodynamics intepretation @xcite : rewriting @xmath59 as @xmath60 and multiplying it by @xmath61 and using @xmath62 one obtains @xmath63 the three terms in the above equation may now be identified in an intuitively plausible manner as : @xmath64 leading to the energy balance equation : @xmath65 with @xmath66 ( -@xmath66 ) understood as the heat flow into of ( out ) the system and @xmath67 ( -@xmath67 ) as the work done by ( on ) the system .",
    "the stochastic averages of these quantities denote by @xmath68 respectively relate directly to the corresponding thermodynamic quantities and capture the thermodynamic conservation laws .",
    "this self - contained approach is clearly more microscopic than thermodynamics as it provides a framework for computing not only the averages of these quantities but their probability distributions as well .",
    "we note here that while it is certainly possible to transcribe the master equation dynamics directly into equivalent quantum langevin equations for the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 but owing to their noncommutativity the crucial step @xmath69 needed to obtain a clear thermodynamic interpretation of the such langevin equations would now involve terms like @xmath70 and would therefore be fraught with ordering ambiguities .      before proceeding further it is instructive to check that the wigner description above together with the thermodynamic interpretation implied by @xmath79 in the steady state does indeed reproduce the results given earlier for the efficiencies of the three engines using standard thermodynamic considerations .",
    "thus , for instance , calculation of the efficiency of the stirling engine involves computing @xmath80 @xmath81 , @xmath82 which in the present framework are given by @xmath83    further , from the fpe or the langevin eqns it follows that in the steady state @xmath84 these on using @xmath85 then give @xmath86 d\\omega\\nonumber\\\\ & ~~=k_bt_h\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sinh(\\beta_h\\omega_2/2 ) } { \\sinh(\\beta_h\\omega_1/2)}\\right)=f(1)-f(2),\\\\ & \\delta { w}_{3\\rightarrow 4 } = -\\int_{\\omega_{1}}^{\\omega_{2 } } [ n(\\omega , t_c)+1/2 ]   d\\omega\\nonumber\\\\ & ~~=-k_bt_c\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sinh(\\beta_c\\omega_2/2 ) } { \\sinh(\\beta_c\\omega_1/2)}\\right)=[f(3)-f(4)],\\\\ & \\delta { u}_{1\\rightarrow 2}= [ \\omega_{1}(n(\\omega_{1},t_h)+\\frac{1}{2 } ) -[\\omega_2(n(\\omega_{2},t_h)+\\frac{1}{2})],\\\\ & \\delta{u}_{4\\rightarrow 1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( [ \\omega_{2}(n(\\omega_{2},t_h)+\\frac{1}{2})]-[\\omega_2(n(\\omega_{2},t_c ) + \\frac{1}{2})]\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are the same expressions as before and therefore one recovers the expression for efficiency given in section ii .",
    "( note here that in computing @xmath87 we considered only the contribution from @xmath88 and not from @xmath89 , a question that will be examined in greater detail later . )",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the langevin equations equivalent to the fokker - planck equation obeyed by the wigner distribution lend themselves to a direct and transparent thermodynamic interpretation and that this interpretation in the steady state limit reproduces the standard thermodynamic results . to prepare ground for going beyond the steady state limit",
    "we now analyse the structure of the solutions of the langevin equations at hand allowing for arbitrary time dependence in the potential and the diffusion coefficients and apply this framework to arrive at the exact solutions of the langevin equations for three fairly realistic models .",
    "the langevin equations which in the present case are linear stochastic equations with additive noise may be solved to yield : @xmath90 where @xmath91 solves the homogeneous equations @xmath92 from @xmath93 for the variance matrix @xmath94 one has @xmath95m^{t}(t).\\ ] ] it is therefore clear that finding explicit solutions for the variances in situations where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend on time depends on our ability to solve for @xmath96 .",
    "we list below three physically meaningful cases where this is indeed possible .",

    "we first consider the case in which the the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath0 is in equilibrium with a bath at temperature @xmath114 characterized by a diffusion constant @xmath115 . with @xmath0",
    "held fixed , the the diffusion coefficient is changed linearly from its initial value @xmath115 appropriate to temperature @xmath114 to its final value @xmath116 appropriate to temperature @xmath117 in a time @xmath5 and then kept at that value thereafter .",
    "@xmath118 this situation pertains to the isochoric step in the brownian engines and is relevant for discussions on aspects of decoupling the system from a heat bath at one temperature and recoupling it to another heat bath at a different temperature .    for the case at hand ,",

    "the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 thus interpolate between the initial and the final equilibrium values of @xmath89 and @xmath88 and quantify the approach to equilibrium . in the following",
    "we consider the case when @xmath131 i.e. the situation that obtains immediately after the bath has reached the state characterized by the final value of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "evidently as far as the system is concerned we are dealing here with a non equilibrium state as the system has not yet had time to equilibriate with the ` final ' bath .    putting @xmath131 in @xmath132 and @xmath133 and denoting @xmath134 and @xmath135 simply as @xmath136 and @xmath6",

    "we recall that in the calculation of the efficiency of the stirling engine from standard thermodynamic considerations presented in section ii , we had drawn attention to the factor of @xmath151 in the expression for @xmath152 .",
    "likewise in the computation of the stirling engine using the quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the steady state we had noted that in computing @xmath152 only @xmath153 contributes to @xmath152 and not @xmath154 .",
    "this seemingly ad hoc prescription can now be understood at a deeper level in the light of the analysis in section v leading to eqns .",
    "it is clear from the discussion therin that , in general , the expression for @xmath152 should be taken to be @xmath156 where @xmath136 and @xmath6 depend on various time scales involved . indeed in the overdamped regime @xmath157 and @xmath158 and",

    "the situation is very different and this has significant consequences for the the relative magnitude of classical and quantum efficiencies under same operating conditions as discussed later .",
