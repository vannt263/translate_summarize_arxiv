    "the interaction of an atom with a periodic perturbation has an extensive history @xcite . in the field of ultracold atoms and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , oscillating magnetic fields",
    "have provided two robust and novel techniques to facilitate the atom trapping .",
    "the first one utilizes a low frequency oscillating magnetic field for generating a time orbiting potential ( top ) trap @xcite , which provided a simple solution to avoid the majorana losses at the quadrupole magnetic trap center and enabled the first realization of bec in a dilute atomic gas @xcite .",
    "the second technique is based on the proposal by zobay and garraway @xcite to use a strong high frequency oscillating magnetic field ( _ i.e. _ rf - field ) for dressing atomic states in the static magnetic trap . the trapping potential for an atom , generated with the combination of a static magnetic field and a strong dressing rf - field , is known as ` rf - dressed potential ' @xcite .",
    "these traps , also referred as ` rf - dressed magnetic traps ' , are now becoming popular due to their inherent flexibility in tailoring the trapping potential , which is not easily possible with the static magnetic trap alone due to the limitations posed by the maxwell s equation @xmath0 and earnshaw s theorem .",
    "a considerable control over the atom trapping geometries , using rf - dressed potentials , can be obtained by controlling the rf - field parameters such as amplitude , polarization , frequency and phase @xcite .",
    "using rf - dressed magnetic traps , several atom trapping geometries such as double - well , shell and ring traps have already been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "this kind of extensive control on trapping and manipulation of cold atoms is useful for various applications of cold atoms , starting from the study of fundamental physics to the matter wave interferometry based precision measurements @xcite .",
    "the progress so far made in the theoretical and experimental works related to the rf - dressed potentials involves mainly monochromatic rf - field @xcite , with a very few exceptions @xcite . with a polychromatic dressing rf - field and a static magnetic field ,",
    "the theoretical description of the interaction of an atom with these fields becomes complicated due to the breakdown of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "nevertheless , the case of rf - field having components at two frequencies , one component being stronger than the other , has been treated perturbatively to explain the results of rf - spectroscopy of ultracold atoms trapped in rf - dressed potential of stronger rf - field @xcite . for the case of all frequency components in the rf - field being sufficiently strong , a local resonance model was suggested by @xcite , which has validity in the close proximity of the resonance region but breaks down for rf - fields with closely spaced frequencies . hence , to overcome these limitations , a new formalism for rf - dressed traps is required where the rf - field is of polychromatic nature with the field modes having arbitrary frequency separation and field strength .    in this paper ,",
    "a theoretical frame work has been developed , using the many mode floquet theory formalism @xcite , to describe the use of a polychromatic rf - field for the dressing of a static quadrupole trap .",
    "this mmft approach , being neither perturbative nor based on rwa , seems a prominent formalism to obtain an insight into the composite atom - field system and generate the potential landscapes for the trapping of cold atoms . in this approach ,",
    "the properties of the atomic system can be derived from the spectral structure of the eigen - energies of the floquet operator and the corresponding composite floquet states @xcite . the time - dependence in the atom - field interaction hamiltonian",
    "is removed by representing the hamiltonian in an infinite dimensional hilbert space composed of the floquet basis states of the atomic system and the fourier states of the radiation field . to begin with ,",
    "we have compared the mmft formalism with the earlier established methods for single and two frequency rf - fields .",
    "the results are adequate to establish the superiority of the mmft approach over these approaches .",
    "we have then extended the mmft formalism to calculate the measurable parameters for the atomic system interacting with a polychromatic rf - field in presence of a static quadrupole magnetic trap .",
    "our aim is to apply this floquet formalism to calculate the eigen - energies of the coupled atom - field ( polychromatic ) system , which can facilitate the trapping of ultracold atoms in new types of rf - dressed potentials .",
    "the mmft also enables us to find out the time averaged transition probabilities between different atomic states .",
    "the results of the mmft approach predict that with the polychromatic dressing rf - field , the eigen - energies of the atomic system show a lattice like periodic structure .",
    "it is also found that there exist a large two - photon transition probability between the atomic states .",
    "this work thus predicts the possibility of generating the lattice type rf - dressed potentials for atom trapping .",
    "these lattices are similar to the optical lattices formed by the interfering laser beams , but offer better control over the lattice spacing and depth than the optical lattices .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mmft ] the theoretical background of the mmft has been discussed . in section [ subsec :",
    "compare ] , the results of mmft approach are compared with those of a dressed state approach under the rotating wave approximation for a single and two mode rf - field . in section [ subsec : poly ] , the results of mmft with a polychromatic rf - field has been discussed in detail .",
    "finally section [ sec : concln ] presents the conclusion of our work .",
    "the many mode floquet formalism is applied in several areas of science as described in the earlier works @xcite . in particular , the use of mmft is very popular to study interaction of atoms with ultra intense laser fields and to explain several important phenomenon such as multi - photon ionization and generation of higher harmonics @xcite . here we note that , the interaction of an atom with an rf - field can differ significantly with that of the electric field of a laser radiation due to different nature of interaction . in this article",
