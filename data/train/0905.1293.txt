    "here @xmath15 is the single file diffusion ( sfd ) mobility .",

    "by contrast well defined model systems can be created with micron sized colloidal particles .",
    "one of the major advantages is that the particles can be directly imaged in real time with digital video microscopy . by using lithography  @xcite or optical tweezers  @xcite to create the one - dimensional confinement for colloidal particles , unambiguous evidence of asymptotic sfd @xmath16 scaling",

    "( [ eq : sfdmsd ] ) .",
    "an obvious question raised by the experiments on sfd is what happens as the confinement becomes less severe . at some point",
    "the system should cross over to ordinary fickian diffusion at long time - scales .",
    "this problem was first studied by coupling two lattice gas models so that particles could jump between chains  @xcite . allowing the jumps produced a crossover in the mean - square displacement from subdiffusive @xmath27 scaling to diffusive @xmath28 asymptotic scaling at long times .",
    "difficulties in interpreting measurements of sfd transport in zeolites also inspired simulations that exhibited a similar long - time crossover to fickian diffusion  @xcite .",
    "as shown by mon and percus  @xcite it is convenient to analyze this crossover in terms of a markov process with a hopping time @xmath5 that measures the average time for two particles to pass one another .",
    "if @xmath29 , so that the system has reached the sfd regime between hops , then the average mean - square displacement of the particles scales as @xmath30 between hops . within this picture a particle makes on average @xmath31 hops in a time @xmath24 so that its mean - square displacement scales as @xmath32 which defines an effective fickian diffusion coefficient of the form @xmath33 the larger @xmath5 , the smaller @xmath34 , since particles passing events become more rare .",

    "we employ a hybrid md and stochastic rotations dynamics ( srd ) computer simulation method that has been shown to accurately reproduce brownian and hydrodynamic behaviour for colloidal suspensions  @xcite .",
    "srd , also known as multi - particle collision dynamics , was first described by malevanets and kapral  @xcite .",
    "srd has been applied to a wide number of different systems , including fluid vesicles in shear flow  @xcite , clay - like colloids  @xcite , sedimentation of colloids  @xcite , colloidal rods in shear flow  @xcite , knots in viral dna  @xcite and many other examples  @xcite .",
    "we have recently used this method to study the role of confinement on two - dimensional diffusion  @xcite and the role of finite sized particles on taylor dispersion  @xcite .    to capture the correct asymptotic trends for the mean - square displacement ,",
    "very long simulation runs are needed , which explains why so many of the simulations in the literature have been on two - dimensional models , which are generally faster to simulate than three - dimensional systems . in this paper",
    "we study strongly repulsive colloidal discs in confinement , using both the hybrid md - srd method as well as simpler bd to compare what happens when hi are ignored .",
    "we find , in agreement with experiments on colloidal suspensions  @xcite , that the simple hard - rod model for the sfd mobility  ( [ eq : mobhr ] ) provides a good fit both for bd and for the simulations that include hi .    when the pipe diameter is such that @xmath38 , so that the mutual passage constraint is lifted , we observe a crossover from sfd sub - diffusion to fickian diffusion at longer times @xmath39 .",
    "we measure the distribution of hopping times @xmath5 , showing that they follow poissonian statistics for simulations with and without hydrodynamic interactions . for both models",
    "we also find a scaling consistent with @xmath40 .",
    "for the bd simulations , we find that @xmath41 for small @xmath42 , but @xmath5 depends more strongly on @xmath43 when hydrodynamic interactions are included .",
    "we attribute this to repulsive lubrication forces , induced when particles approach each other other or the walls of the container .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we describe the model , our hybrid md - srd method and our implementation of bd . in section iii",
    "we study the sfd behaviour of colloids confined to one - dimensional flows for different packing fractions @xmath44 .",
    "section iv considers the case when the mutual passage constraint is lifted , so that at long times fickian diffusion is recovered .",
    "finally , in section v , we discuss the main conclusions of this study .",
    "for the colloid - colloid interactions , we use a very strongly repulsive potential of the form : @xmath45 where @xmath2 is the colloid - colloid diameter .",
    "the colloid - wall interaction is taken to be strongly repulsive as well , and a stick - boundary condition is applied to the colloids , as well as to the fluid particle - wall interaction in the srd simulations .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the direction parallel to the pipe walls .      to describe the hydrodynamic behaviour of colloids induced by a background fluid of much smaller constituents , some form of coarse - graining",
    "is required .",
    "the hydrodynamics can be described by the navier stokes equations that coarse - grain the fluid within a continuum description .",
    "the downside of going directly through this route is that every time the colloids move , the boundary conditions on the differential equations change , making them computationally expensive to solve .",
    "an alternative to computing a direct solution of the navier stokes equations is to use particle based techniques that exploit the fact that only a few conditions , such as ( local ) energy and momentum conservation , need to be satisfied to allow the correct ( thermo ) hydrodynamics to emerge in the continuum limit .",
    "simple particle collision rules , easily amenable to efficient computer simulation , can therefore be used .",
    "boundary conditions ( such as those imposed by colloids in suspension ) are easily implemented as external fields .    in this paper",

    "an srd fluid is modelled by @xmath19 point particles of mass @xmath46 , with positions @xmath47 and velocities @xmath48 .",
    "the coarse graining procedure consists of two steps , streaming and collision . during the streaming step ,",
    "the positions of the fluid particles are updated via @xmath49 in the collision step , the particles are split up into cells with sides of length @xmath50 , and their velocities are rotated around an angle @xmath51 with respect to the cell centre of mass velocity , @xmath52\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the centre of mass velocity of the particles in each cell , @xmath54 is the rotational matrix and @xmath55 is the interval between collisions .",
    "the purpose of this collision step is to transfer momentum between the fluid particles while conserving the energy and momentum of each cell .",
    "the fluid particles only interact with one another through the collision procedure .",
    "direct interactions between the solvent particles are not taken into account , so that the algorithm scales as @xmath56@xmath57 with particle number .",
    "the carefully constructed rotation procedure can be viewed as a coarse - graining of particle collisions over space _ and _ time .",
    "mass , energy and momentum are conserved locally , so that on large enough length - scales the correct navier stokes hydrodynamics naturally emerges  @xcite .",
    "it is important to remember that for all these particle based methods , the particles should not be viewed as composite supramolecular fluid units , but rather as coarse - grained navier stokes solvers ( with noise in the case of srd )  @xcite .",
    "another advantage of srd is that transport coefficients have been analytically calculated  @xcite , greatly facilitating its use .",
    "the srd fluid particles can easily be coupled to a solute as first shown by malevanets and kapral  @xcite , and studied in detail in a recent paper  @xcite . to simulate the behaviour of colloids of mass @xmath58",
    ", we use the colloid - colloid interaction defined above , while the solvent particles interact with the colloids via an interaction of the form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the colloid - solvent collision diameter .",
    "we propagate the ensuing equations of motion with a velocity verlet algorithm  @xcite using a molecular dynamic time step @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the position and velocity of the colloid , and @xmath65 is the total force exerted on the colloid .",
    "coupling the colloids in this way leads to slip boundary conditions .",
    "stick boundary conditions can also be implemented  @xcite , but for qualitative behaviour , we do nt expect there to be important differences . in parallel the velocities and positions of the srd particles are streamed in the external potential given by the colloids and the external walls and updated with the srd rotation - collision step every time - step @xmath55 .",
    "the larger the ratio @xmath66 , the more accurately the hydrodynamic flow fields will be reproduced . in ref",
    "@xcite , it is shown that using @xmath67 , and @xmath68 reproduces the flow fields with small relative errors for a single sphere in a 3d flow . because we are interested in processes where the colloids can just barely pass each other , we chose a finer grid ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this should in particular enhance the resolution of lubrication forces  @xcite .",
    "other parameter choices taken from refs  @xcite include @xmath70 for the colloids , an srd particle density of @xmath71 particles per @xmath72 and a rotation angle of @xmath73 .",
    "the time - steps for the md and srd step are set by different physics  @xcite , and we chose @xmath74 and @xmath75 for srd , where @xmath76 is the unit of time in our simulations .",
    "the particle motion for the colloids can also be solved using bd .",
    "the positions are updated via the equation of motion : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the force acting on the colloids , which arises from the colloid - colloid interaction , as well as the colloid - wall interactions , and each component @xmath79 is chosen from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath80  @xcite , where @xmath13 is the single particle diffusion coefficient .",
    "with bd , the particles execute a random walk with a physical time - scale @xmath81 called the diffusion time that measures how long it takes the particle to diffuse over its diameter .",
    "the bd time - step was chosen to be @xmath82 , slightly smaller than the value used , for example , in a careful study by lodge and heyes  @xcite .",
    "we use this conservative measure of the time - step because there are indications that scaling of the hopping time of colloidal particles simulated with bd is sensitive to the time - step  @xcite ; we checked that our time - step is small enough .",
    "in contrast to the srd method , which also exhibits diffusive motion , the bd method does not include hi .",
    "we first investigate the sfd behaviour of colloidal discs in pipes narrow enough that they can not pass each other . at times less than the collision time",

    "we attribute this increase of @xmath5 to the influence of hydrodynamic lubrication forces that make it harder for the particles to pass one another .",
    "the hopping time @xmath5 and diffusion coefficient @xmath34 depend strongly on @xmath120 .",
    "this means that measuring how @xmath5 or @xmath34 depend on @xmath120 may be difficult for experiments , because very small relative errors in the channel width can lead to large effects . but",
    "this sensitivity to changes in @xmath120 could also be used as an advantage , since it could be exploited , for example , by microfluidic applications  @xcite as a very sensitive way to measure of the size of particles in artificial channels .",
