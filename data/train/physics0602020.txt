    "several articles have appeared recently that aim to describe the virus structure , shape and stability by using physical principles .",
    "virus related research seems to be particularly appealing to physicists since viruses exhibit many features that are reminiscent of well known and thoroughly studied phenomena in  more traditional  physical systems . for example , fifty years ago fraenkel - conrat demonstrated that infectious viral particles ( tobacco mosaic viruses , tmv ) can be reassembled from two solutions , one containing the viral genetic material ( rna ) and the other its coat ( or _ capsid _ ) proteins ( a short historical overview of research on reconstitution of tmv can be found in ref . [ ] ) .",
    "the reassembly of tmv proceeds without any special external impetus - it is spontaneous .",
    "the fact that viruses can be reassembled in _ in vitro _",
    "conditions suggests that their shape and symmetry should be a result of free energy minimization , a concept familiar from equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "this line of thought has recently been successfully applied in the explanation of physical _ origin _ of the icosahedral symmetry of viruses ( see below ) and other possible shapes and geometries that might be adopted by viruses @xcite .",
    "production of functional molecular machine from its constituent , possibly engineered molecular components is of course a dream of nanotechnologists",
    ". such approach to",
    " molecular engineering  does not require precise molecular positioning , since correct assembly takes place _ spontaneously _ due to specific architecture of the molecular constituents and pronounced anisotropy of their mutual interactions , hence the term _ self - assembly _ is often used in nanotechnological context .",
    "the structural symmetry and shape of virus coating is in itself intriguing .",
    "there have been attempts to draw parallels between the symmetry of viruses , penrose tilings @xcite , and quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "most viruses have a structure with topology equal to that of triangulated icosahedra ( see fig [ fig : fig1 ] ) .    individual proteins that make the viral coating ( approximated by triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) are organized in units called _ capsomers _ that consist of five ( pentamers ) or six protein units ( hexamers ) .",
    "most viruses contain only twelve pentamers and remaining capsomers are hexamers @xcite .",
    "pentamers are located at twelve vertices of an icosahedron .",
    "such structures are very similar to giant fullerene molecules @xcite .",
    "it is also easy to see a structural relationship between the virus and an icosahedral geodesic dome @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest virus structures ( @xmath0 , see below ) , characteristic of small viruses ( e.g. cucumber mosaic virus @xcite ) , contains twelve pentamers and twenty hexamers and is topologically equivalent to a famous buckminsterfullerene molecule ( c@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "icosahedral symmetry that is characteristic of viral shapes is also frequently found in ground state configurations of atomic clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "poligonalizaton of a sphere with pentagons and hexagons is often described in terms of caspar - klug quasiequivalent construction @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "viruses are characterized by the so - called _ @xmath2 number _ which describes the order of a poligonalization .",
    "the @xmath2 number can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are nonnegative integers .",
    "the meaning of these integers can be quickly grasped from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . note how the two neighboring pentamers in the structure displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] can be connected through two subsequent translations along two distinct spherical geodesics .",
    "the magnitudes of these translations are nonnegative integer multiples ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) of distances between the nearest - neighboring capsomers , so as that the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] can be characterized by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , or @xmath8 .",
    "the total number of capsomeric units in a virus of particular @xmath2-number symmetry is @xmath9 .",
    "twelve of these units are pentamers and remaining @xmath10 are hexamers @xcite .",
    "the shapes of viral capsids have been recently studied within the framework of nonlinear theory of elastic shells @xcite .",
    "these studies have produced rather interesting results and excellent fits to experimentally determined virus shapes have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of the shell shapes that these studies predict is the _ buckling transition_.",
    "the buckling transition has been earlier predicted for planar triangular meshes with a pentagonal or heptagonal defect introduced in their structure @xcite . as a consequence of minimization of the total energy , which includes both stretching and bending contributions , the crystalline mesh buckles in a conical shape in the vicinity of a pentagonal defect ( or disclination ) .",
    "this transition is observed only above the critical value of the so - called _ foppl - von krmn number _ ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , which is an effective parameter combining the mesh radius , two - dimensional young s modulus ( @xmath12 ) and bending rigidity ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this parameter uniquely describes the shape of continuous shells . a pentagonal  defect ",
    "( pentamer ) is characteristic of a virus structure , and viral coating can thus be viewed as a continuous shell with twelve pentagonal disclinations introduced in otherwise hexagonally coordinated crystalline structure ( each vertex in the  regular  mesh has six nearest neighbors ) .",
    "the two studies @xcite have reached the conclusion that the remnants of buckling transitions survive in the more complex geometry of a spherical ( closed ) shell with twelve pentagonal disclinations .",
    "this transition is not as sharp as in the case of a ( two - dimensional ) disk , nevertheless an observable buckling transition of the shell was found for fppl - von krmn ( fvk ) numbers between about @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this effect has been related to the features of the experimentally determined virus shapes , and it can correctly describe the global trend of larger viruses being more faceted ( or buckled ) than smaller ones @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting propositions put forth by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the process of virus maturation can be described in part by the buckling transition of viral capsids .",
    "virus maturation is the process through which the assembled viral particles become fully functional .",
    "its precise evolution depends on the type ( or family ) of the virus in question , in particular whether the viruses are enveloped by the cell membrane proteins or not . for a large class of non - enveloped viruses",
    "[ e.g. those containing the double stranded dna ( dsdna ) in their mature form @xcite ] , the maturation consists of incorporation of the genetic material in a preassembled , empty protein capsid ( the so called precursor capsid or _ procapsid _ ) . during the maturation process",
    "the capsid typically  swells  and mature capsids are larger from their precursor counterparts .",
    "a faceted shape is often a characteristic of a mature virus , whereas ( immature ) precursor capsids have a more spherical shape .",
    "this transition in shape has been described within a framework of the elastic theory of shells in terms of the change of the fvk number @xcite - the fvk number in mature viral shells is larger than in their respective precursor capsids . however , during the buckling transition of elastic shells , the volume enclosed by the shell _ decreases _ , whereas for most viruses , the mature viral capsids enclose _ larger _ volume from the immature precursor capsids @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to investigate whether the buckling transition in elastic shells survives in more restrictive circumstances , in particular under the constraint of volume conservation and when the internal pressure acting on the shell is nonvanishing .",
    "these constraints may be thought of as the simplest possible introduction of the capsid - dna / rna interaction in the problem of virus shapes .",
    "thus , an investigation of the characteristics of buckling transition in more general conditions should be of use for a more thorough understanding of viral capsid shapes in their immature and mature forms .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] briefly discusses the model of elasticity and minimal energy shapes of shells with 12 pentagonal disclinations subjected to a constraint of fixed volume .",
    "section [ sec : empty ] contains the results pertaining to empty shells , i.e. without the imposition of the fixed enclosed volume or constant pressure constraints .",
    "this section deals with the subject already treated in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] , and its main purpose is to clearly demonstrate that the _ shell volume decreases during the buckling transition_. in section [ sec : full ] , the minimal energy shell shapes with the imposed constraint of fixed enclosed volume are studied .",
    "it is shown that the buckling transition survives in that case also , although the buckled shapes are less aspherical than the ones obtained without the volume conservation constraint .",
    "section [ sec : press ] contains results regarding the buckling transition of shells subjected to constant environmental pressure ( the difference in pressures in the inner and outer space of the shell is fixed ) .",
    "section [ sec : appli ] relates the results of the article to the virus maturation process .",
    "several possible scenarios that reproduce the experimentally observed fact of mature viruses being more aspherical , facetted from their immature precursors are discussed .",
    "new predictions for the parameters characterizing the elastic response of viral coatings are given .",
    "section [ sec : discuss ] briefly summarizes the results and concludes the article .",
    "i start from the model of elasticity described in refs . [ ] .",
    "briefly , the shell surface is discretized in triangular plaquettes and the hamiltonian describing such system is @xmath16 where indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) describe the two neighboring triangle vertices ( surfaces ) located at @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , @xmath23 is the scale of energy related to a change of the distance between the two neighboring vertices ( stretching ) , while @xmath24 is the scale of energy related to a change of dihedral angle ( bending ) between the two neighboring triangles ( those sharing a side ) whose normal vectors are denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the equilibrium distance between the two neighboring vertices is @xmath26 , and it is assumed that the neighboring triangular plaquettes prefer to lie in the same plane , i.e. the preferred angle between their normal vectors is zero .",

    "the discrete hamiltonian becomes reliable for the description of continuous elastic medium described by young s modulus @xmath27 , poisson s ratio @xmath28 , bending rigidity @xmath29 , and gaussian rigidity @xmath30 @xcite .    finding a minimum - energy state ( or a shape ) of a problem defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) consists of multidimensional search for a minimum of the hamiltonian function @xmath31 that depends on @xmath32 coordinates , where @xmath33 is the number of mesh vertices .",
    "this search is _ unconstrained _ which means that there are no relationships between the variables @xmath34 that have to be obeyed .",
    "it is possible to do a constrained search for the minimum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) , specifying additionally some relations that the variables ( or a shape ) have to obey .",
    "the volume of a shell can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of the mesh vertices as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the three vertices of the triangle @xmath19 in ( counter)clockwise order .",
    "a search for a minimum of eq . ( [ eq : h0 ] ) with the independent variables ( vertex coordinates ) additionally fulfilling @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a fixed quantity , should result in a shape that minimizes the function @xmath31 in the subspace of all possible shapes that enclose volume @xmath39 .",
    "the volume constraint is implemented in the numerical procedure using the so - called penalized version of the hamiltonian @xcite where an additional , quadratic penalty term of the form @xmath40 is added to the original hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) , so that the new hamiltonian ( @xmath41 ) is given by @xmath42 .",
    "ideally , penalty parameter @xmath43 should be extremely large ( and positive ) to strictly impose the volume constraint .",
    "the problem of finding a minimum of a strongly constrained hamiltonian is solved using the so - called continuation technique @xcite .",
    "a small value of @xmath43 is chosen initially , which enables a quick numerical convergence of the shape .",
    "this shape is used as an initial guess for the hamiltonian in which @xmath43 is ten times larger ( @xmath44 ) , and the procedure is repeated until @xmath43 is large enough so that the volume constraint is fulfilled to a machine precision .      the constant internal pressure ( @xmath45 ) is introduced in the problem by adding to the shell hamiltonian a term @xmath46 , so that the new hamiltonian of the problem ( @xmath41 ) is given by @xmath47 this introduces an additional force @xmath48 on the @xmath17-th vertex which is given by @xmath49 .",
    "a word of caution concerning the @xmath2-numbers of triangulated shells used by the authors of refs . @xcite and caspar - klug @xmath2-numbers pertaining to viral shells is in order here .",
    "it should be understood that these two are not the same .",
    "for example , for the idealized virus structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the caspar - klug @xmath2-number is 7 ( @xmath50 ) , while the @xmath2-number characteristic of a kind of triangulation ( without reference to pentamer / hexamer structures @xcite ) is 21 ( @xmath51 , this can be obtained by simply following a path from one pentamer to its neighboring pentamer with integer steps along the sides of the mesh triangles and not through the centers of pentamer / hexamer structures ) .",
    "of course , the two @xmath2-numbers become the same if _ every _ vertex in the triangular mesh corresponds to the center of a capsomer . in",
    "what follows , i shall reserve the term `` @xmath2-number '' for the characterization of the shell triangulation , while the term `` caspar - klug @xmath2-number '' shall be used for the characterization of @xmath2-numbers in the context in which they were originally introduced .",
    "icosahedral shells with various @xmath2-numbers have been constructed and their total energy ( @xmath52 , which includes both stretching and bending contributions ) as a function of bending modulus , @xmath13 has been calculated .",
    "other parameters of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) have been kept fixed ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "the initial shape for @xmath55 has been setup [ typically a sphere with a radius of @xmath56 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : volestimate ] ) ] , and the minimum energy shape was obtained by an efficient implementation of the conjugate gradient method described in ref .",
    "the resulting shape is used as an initial guess for the situation in which @xmath13 is decreased , and this procedure is repeated until @xmath13 becomes rather small . as demonstrated by the authors of ref .

    "for the buckled shapes ( @xmath71 ) , the functional dependence of the energy related to disclinations profoundly changes , and one has to account for the energies resulting from the bending of the conical section in the vicinity of each of the disclinations .",

    "note that the volume constraint of @xmath94 is _ not _ a constraint at the point when @xmath95 , since at that point the volume adopted by the unconstrained shell equals to the constrained volume ( see fig .",

    "thus , the energy curves for the unconstrained shape and the shape constrained to @xmath96 touch at @xmath95 .",

    "[ fig : fig7c ] .",
    "it is clear that large internal pressures suppress the change in aspherity in the buckling transition , but the transition is still observed within the region of pressures studied here .",
    "note that this is not a trivial finding since for @xmath118 , the enclosed shell volume for @xmath119 is 1.4 times larger from the volume that would be enclosed by the shell without the applied pressure , yet the buckling transition still survives .",
    "it is of use to scale the pressures studied in sec . [",
    "sec : press ] to circumstances that are relevant to viruses . to do this ,",
    "an estimate of the elastic parameters of the viral coatings is needed .",
    "the authors of ref . have suggested that the ratio @xmath120 appropriate for viruses is about 1 - 2 nm@xmath121 .",
    "the authors of ref . have taken a step further and they estimate that the young modulus of the viral coating is about @xmath122/nm@xmath123 .",
    "the scale of the stretching energy , @xmath23 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath12 [ see eq.([eq : h0 ] ) and the discussion following it ] , thus i shall fix @xmath23 to @xmath124 .",
    "the radius of the virus in its spherical ( immature ) form depends on the virus in question .",
    "if one considers hk97 bacteriophage procapsid of radius @xmath125 nm , the scale of pressure for this virus is @xmath126 pa @xmath127 16.4 atm .",
    "the highest pressure studied ( -0.331 @xmath104 ) would thus in case of hk97 bacteriophage be about 548600 pa @xmath127 5.42 atm .",
    "it is of interest to compare these numbers to those obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] . in studying the energetics of dna inserted in the preformed viral capsids , the authors have found @xcite that for a virus of radius 27.5 nm , the pressure that the _ fully _ packed dna genome ( whose length is 16.5 @xmath128 m ) exerts on its walls is about 30 - 45 atm . for a virus of such radius ,",
    "the pressure scale introduced in this article should be about @xmath129 15.5 atm , assuming the same value for @xmath23 as for the hk97 bacteriophage . the highest pressure studied in this work",
    "would then correspond to 5.1 atm , about 6 times smaller from the pressure acting in the filled viral capsid of the virus studied in ref . .",
    "similar estimate for the pressure that the fully loaded genetic material exerts on the viral coating was obtained in ref . .",
    "for @xmath13029 bacteriophage , the authors estimate that the internal pressure is about 60 atm , in agreement with previous estimates from ref . .",
    "there is an obvious agreement in the literature concerning the internal pressures in mature viral capsids .",
    "however , for such large internal pressures , _ and assuming that _ @xmath131/nm@xmath123 the mean square aspherities of buckled shapes ( i.e. mature viruses ) should be very small ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7c ] ) , far smaller than observed e.g. for mature hk97 capsid ( 0.00116 ) . on the other hand",
    ", one could insist on the application of the present model to viruses and use the results presented here to re - estimate the value of the young modulus of the coating of a mature virus .",
    "in other words , the aim is to scale the internal pressures to the values obtained in previous studies and to obtain new estimates for elastic parameters of mature viral capsid .",
    "i shall again concentrate on hk97 virus . assuming that the capsid s elastic parameters are in the region where the mean square aspherity saturates , the internal pressure should be about 0.045 @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7c ] - this internal pressure results in final aspherity that is about the same as in mature hk97 virus ) . equating this with the estimated internal pressure of about 40 atm @xcite , and using @xmath125 nm",
    ", one obtains that for the mature hk97 virus , @xmath132/nm@xmath123 ( 2.7 n / m ) , about sixty times larger from the estimate of ref . , but closer to the alternative ( discarded ) estimate of ref .",
    "[ ] which was about @xmath1331 n / m . the bending rigidity should then be smaller than about 1.8 10@xmath134 j ( @xmath135 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7c ] ) .",
    "division of the two - dimensional young s modulus obtained in this study with the thickness of the mature hk97 viral shell ( about 2.5 nm @xcite ) yields an approximate prediction for the 3d ( bulk ) young s modulus ( @xmath136 ) of the viral protein shell .",
    "this procedure gives @xmath136 = 1.1 gpa which is about fourty percent smaller from the value found in the experimental study of the elastic response of empty viral shells of @xmath13029 bacteriophage with the use of afm microscope ( 1.8 gpa ) @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the results obtained here relate to elastic properties of _ mature _ ( filled ) viral shells , while the experimental results are performed on empty capsids . nevertheless , the results obtained here suggest that the young s modulus of the viral coating may be significantly larger than predicted in ref . [ ] and closer to the value discarded by authors of that work .",
    "the alternative value of young s modulus was discarded by authors of ref .",
    "[ ] on the basis of monte carlo simulations of a coarse grained capsomer @xcite model which yielded that the bending rigidity @xmath13 should be of the order of the capsomer - capsomer cohesive binding energy .",
    "thus , the results presented here may point towards improvements in the coarse - grained model of viruses .",
    "pouring a liquid into a spherical elastic shell ( immature capsid ) , or applying a pressure to it from the inside will not , of course , change its shape to a more aspherical one .",
    "what ought to happen `` during pouring '' ( insertion of a genetic material ) is a _ dynamical process that changes the elastic properties of a capsid _ ,",
    "i.e. that effectively increases its fvk number . only then will a mature capsid be more aspherical than the precursor capsid .",
    "so , the results presented in this article can not , of course , provide the full physical description of virus maturation .",
    "nevertheless , if the change of the capsid shape is influenced by the fact that the capsid is filled with the genetic material ( in the most trivial sense of finite volume occupation or simulated by the constant internal pressure ) , the results should prove useful .",
    "the presented results essentially show that _ if _ there is a process that increases the effective fvk number of the capsid , the volume conservation constraint or finite internal pressure that may be imposed by the inserted genetic material is not strong enough to destroy the signatures of the buckling transition , and the  mature  shell will be more aspherical from its  precursor  shell , although to lesser amount than could be concluded from the study of buckling transition in _ empty _ shells ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "now , what could be the process that induces the change of elastic properties of the viral capsid ?",
    "the proposition put forth by lidmar _",
    "et al _ @xcite is that the fvk number changes during the maturation due to the _ increase _ of radius ( @xmath137 ) and _ decrease _ of effective thickness of the protein coating , @xmath138 . according to ref .",
    "[ ] , if one approximates a shell by a uniform isotropic elastic medium of thickness @xmath138 with the poisson ratio @xmath139 , then its effective fvk number should be about @xmath140 if one additionally assumes that the volume of the capsid protein material ( not the volume _ enclosed _ by the capsid ) remains the same , and that @xmath139 does not change during maturation , then the fvk numbers before ( @xmath141 ) and after ( @xmath142 ) the transition for the hk97 capsid studied in ref",
    ". should be @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "this indeed predicts a noticeably more spherical shape of the immature capsid .",
    "it has been experimentally observed that the capsid proteins rearrange themselves significantly during maturation @xcite . to a lesser extent ,",
    "the reorganization involves the refolding of the protein itself , but its main consequence is a rearrangement ( translations and rotations ) of the proteins to another configuration in which the contacts between capsomers change and the capsomers adopt a more symmetrical shape which also results in a smoother shape of the capsid .",
    "this rearrangement has been studied in detail for bacteriophage hk97 and p22 capsid in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] , respectively .",
    "these experimental findings suggest that one should study the effects of a change of the lattice constant , @xmath26 on the shape of the minimum energy shells .",
    "this was done in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] .",
    "the calculations were intentionally performed for small value of @xmath2-number ( @xmath8 , which corresponds to the symmetry of hk97 capsid ) , although one should keep in mind that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) was constructed with the idea of treating the continuous ( large @xmath2-number ) structures for which it makes sense to speak about elastic parameters of protein sheets , and its predictions for small @xmath2-numbers should not be directly transcribed to viral shapes . nevertheless , the form in which the hamiltonian is written [ eq . (",
    "[ eq : h0 ] ) ] suggests its  microscopic  interpretation .",
    "these subtleties were discussed in refs .",
    "[ ] . the calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] were performed for three values of the lattice constant , @xmath145 , scale of the elastic energy was kept constant ( @xmath54 ) , and the bending modulus @xmath13 was changed .",
    "the mean square aspherities were plotted as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the constraint of fixed enclosed volume was not implemented and @xmath102 .",
    "note that in the ",
    "critical  region of values of @xmath13 ( onset of the buckling transition ) , the shapes with very different aspherities can be produced by simply changing the lattice parameter @xmath26 , and keeping all other parameters of the hamiltonian fixed ( for the shapes plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , the bending modulus was @xmath146 ) .",
    "this numerical experiment reproduces the experimental findings that the @xmath147 mature viral shapes enclose larger volume , and @xmath148 mature viral shapes are more facetted from their precursor shapes . of course",
    ", it still does not provide any clues with respect to the process that drives the transition to larger lattice constant .",
    "the buckling transition of shells with twelve pentagonal disclinations situated in vertices of an icosahedron was studied .",
    "the constraint of the fixed enclosed volume was introduced and its effect on the shell shapes and energies explored . the shell shapes and buckling transition",
    "were also investigated in cases when the constant internal pressure acts on the shell .",
    "it was found that the buckling transition survives the volume constraint , at least for the enclosed volumes that are not too large .",
    "the buckled shapes are found to be less aspherical than the ones obtained without the volume constraint .",
    "similar conclusions were reached for shells subjected to constant internal pressure - for pressures that are not too large ( about @xmath149 ) , the buckling transition survives and the buckled shapes are significantly more aspherical from the ones in the region of small fvk numbers . if one transcribes the results of the study of shells under constant internal pressures to the circumstances appropriate to viruses @xcite , an estimate of the two - dimensional young s modulus of the coating can be obtained , and for mature hk97 virus , the value of @xmath150 n / m was found .",
    "this also puts an upper limit on bending rigidity , @xmath151 1.8 10@xmath134 j. for the bulk ( 3d ) young s modulus of the viral coating material this yields a value of about @xmath152 1.1 gpa , which is close to the value found in experimental studies of elastic response of empty @xmath13029 bacteriophage shells @xcite .    whether the fixed enclosed volume of the shell , or the constant internal pressure is a realistic model of the ( mature ) viral shells filled with the genetic material is , of course",
