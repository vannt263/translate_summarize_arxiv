    "<S> transient responses of the information entropies to an input signal and an external force have been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the information entropies also with the use of the probability distribution derived by the maximum - entropy method ( mem ) , whose result is compared to that obtained by the fpe . the cramr - rao inequality is shown to be expressed by the _ extended _ fisher entropy , which is different from the _ generalized _ fisher entropy obtained from the generalized kullback - leibler divergence in conformity with the tsallis entropy . the effect of additive and multiplicative _ colored _ noise on information entropies is discussed also .    </S>",
