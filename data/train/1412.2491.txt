    "hence the observed scale dependent feature of the dipole asymmetry indicates that this model is not the true model to explain the observed si violation .",
    "also detection of similar anisotropic feature from two independent experiments ( wmap and planck ) suggests a cosmological origin of the modulation field in favour of ignored systematic effect @xcite .    to investigate the cosmological origin of this dipole modulation which is present only at large angular scale , we propose a phenomenological model in which the si violated features are prominent in both scalar and tensor perturbation .",
