    "the nuclear sm was proposed almost sixty years ago@xcite .",
    "soon after , the interacting sm was developed and used extensively to understand a wealth of data on nuclear levels , moments , collective excitations , electromagnetic and @xmath1 decays , and various particle decays .",
    "interacting sm describes the nucleus as a closed quantum system : nucleons occupy bound , hence well localized , single - particle orbits of a harmonic oscillator potential and are isolated from the environment of unbound scattering states .",
    "since the scattering continuum is not considered explicitly , the presence of decay thresholds and the interplay of hermitian ( internal ) and anti - hermitian ( external , via the continuum ) mixing of sm configurations is neglected .",
    "this competition yields a complicate interference pattern@xcite and is a source of many collective features such as , e.g. , the resonance trapping@xcite and super - radiance phenomenon@xcite , the multichannel coupling effects in reaction cross - sections@xcite and shell occupancies@xcite , the clustering@xcite , the modification of spectral fluctuations@xcite , the deviations from porter - thomas resonance widths distribution@xcite , and so on .",
    "it was clear in fifties that the sm is a phenomenological tool which employs the strongly renormalized bare nuclear interaction between nucleons@xcite and neglects coupling to the continuum@xcite .",
    "the overwhelming success of the sm , its elegance and simplicity resulted in neglecting most of these questionable assumptions .",
    "unfortunately , the divide between discrete and continuum states in sm has led to an artificial separation of nuclear structure from nuclear reactions , and hindered a deeper understanding of nuclear properties .",
    "it is often believed that the understanding why the simple interacting sm works so well will be advanced when the goal of _ ab initio _ many - body approaches including the continuum coupling will be achieved .",
    "many structural properties of the nucleus are determined by means of nuclear collisions and this calls for a unified theoretical framework .",
    "feshbach at the beginning of sixties formulated a unified theory of nuclear reactions using the effective hamiltonian and the projection operator method to select the open channel components of the wave function@xcite .",
    "this development led to various formulations of the real - energy continuum shell model ( csm)@xcite .",
    "nowadays , the real - energy csm provides a unified description of the structure and reactions with up to two nucleons in the scattering continuum@xcite .    at the same time",
    ", fano noticed that the exact coincidence of different configurations above the lowest particle emission threshold makes the perturbation theory inadequate and calls for a generalization of the standard sm@xcite .",
    "the achievement of fano s goal took almost forty years and required the development of new mathematical approach of the rigged hilbert space@xcite , new methods to deal with diverging integrals ( matrix elements of one- and two - body operators ) involving resonance and scattering states@xcite , the formulation of the generalized completeness relation including single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "bound states , resonances and scattering states@xcite .",
    "these different and independent developments in mathematics and physics enabled finally a satisfactory formulation of the new many - body theory , the gsm@xcite , which offers a fully symmetric treatment of bound , resonance and scattering states in the multiparticle framework . in this formulation ,",
    "the maximum number of particles in the scattering continuum is not _ a priori _ prescribed as in the real - energy csm , but follows from the schrdinger variational principle for the many - body hamiltonian .    until now",
    ", gsm has been primarily used in the context of nuclear structure .",
    "( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in this paper , we shall extend gsm to reaction problems by the coupled - channel ( cc ) formulation of the scattering problem .",
    "the very first application of the gsm - cc formalism will be presented in this paper for the proton scattering on @xmath0he target .",
    "the proposed gsm - cc formalism can be easily straightforwardly generalized for the description of nuclear reactions in the _ ab initio _ framework of the no - core gamow shell model@xcite .    in sect .",
    "2 we present essential features of the gsm .",
    "the reaction wave function and the derivation of gsm - cc equations in the coordinate space representation are discussed in sect .",
    "the method for solving the cc equations is presented in sect .",
    "the first application of the gsm - cc formalism for a description of @xmath0he+p reaction is discussed in sect .",
    "finally , main conclusions of this work are summarized in sect .",
    "-1 cm    resonance phenomena are generic intrinsic properties of many mesoscopic systems .",
    "what is specific to atomic nuclei are strong nucleon - nucleon correlations which impose a simultaneous description of the configuration mixing and the coupling to decay channels . the fundamental difficulty in the csm formulation and the reason why the fano s program@xcite had to wait forty years to find a comprehensive solution is the fact that resonances do not belong to the hilbert space .",
    "therefore , whatever strategy is chosen to formulate a configuration interaction approach in open quantum systems , a key points are always : ( i ) the treatment of s.p .",
    "resonances in a many - body framework , and ( ii ) the definition of complete s.p . and",
    "many - body bases .    for the gsm , a s.p .",
    "basis is given by the berggren ensemble@xcite which consists of gamow ( resonant ) states and the non - resonant continuum ( see fig . [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "( for a detailed description of the gsm see ref .",
    "the gsm hamiltonian is hermitian .",
    "however , since the s.p .",
    "vectors have either outgoing or scattering asymptotics , the hamiltonian matrix in gsm is complex symmetric and its eigenvalues are complex above the first particle emission threshold .",
    "hence , both real - energy and complex - energy csm formulations lead to a non - hermitian eigenvalue problem above the threshold and contain all salient features of an interplay between opposite effects of hermitian and anti - hermitian couplings .      the translationally invariant gsm hamiltonian in intrinsic nucleon - core coordinates of the cluster - orbital shell model@xcite ,",

    "the last term in ( [ gsm_hamiltonian ] ) represents the recoil term .",
    "the particle - core interaction is a sum of nuclear and coulomb terms : @xmath8 .",
    "the nuclear potential @xmath9 is approximated either by a woods - saxon ( ws ) field with a spin - orbit term@xcite or by the gamow - hartree - fock ( ghf ) potential@xcite .",
    "the coulomb field @xmath10 is generated by a gaussian density of @xmath11 core protons@xcite .",
    "similarly , the residual interaction can split into nuclear and coulomb parts : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the modified surface gaussian interaction ( msgi)@xcite and @xmath14 is the two - body coulomb interaction .",
    "@xmath14 can be rewritten as : @xmath15^{ho}$ ] , where @xmath16 takes care of the asymptotic behavior of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the second term in this equation and the two - body recoil term can be expanded in the harmonic oscillator basis@xcite which provides an accurate treatment of the long - range physics of the coulomb potential . in this work",

    "it is then convenient to express channel states in @xmath37-nucleus in the same slater determinant basis .",
