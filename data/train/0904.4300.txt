    "the gravitational - wave astronomy is now becoming reality .",
    "in fact , significant progress has been made on the gravitational wave detectors , such as ligo , vigro , geo600 , tama300 , and aigo with their international network of the observatories ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for the detectors , core - collapse supernovae especially in our galaxy , have been supposed as one of the most plausible sources of gravitational waves ( see , for example , @xcite for recent reviews ) .    traditionally ,",
    "most of the model calculations of gravitational waves ( gws ) have focused on the bounce signals in the context of rotational ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and magneotrotational core - collapse @xcite .",
    "however recent stellar evolution calculations suggest that such rapid rotation assumed in most of the previous studies , albeit attracting much attention currently as a relevance to collapsar @xcite , is not canonical for progenitors of core - collapse supernovae with neutron star formations @xcite in the case of the slowly rotating supernova cores , two other ingredients are expected to be important in the much later phases after core bounce , namely convective motions and anisotropic neutrino emissions . thus far ,",
    "various physical ingredients for producing asphericities and the resulting gws in the postbounce phase , have been studied such as the roles of pre - collapse density inhomogeneities @xcite , moderate rotation of the iron core @xcite , g - mode oscillations of protoneutron stars ( pnss ) @xcite , and the standing - accretion - shock - instability ( sasi ) @xcite .    however ,",
    "most of them have been based on two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations that assume axisymmetry .",
    "then , the growth of sasi ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the large - scale convection , both of which are now considered to generically develop in the postbounce phase and to help the neutrino - driven explosions @xcite , develop along the symmetry axis preferentially , thus suppressing the anisotropies in explosions .",
    "so far very few three - dimensional ( 3d ) studies have been conducted @xcite . moreover ,",
    "neither the growth of the sasi nor its effects on the gws have been studied yet because sasi is suppressed artificially owing to the limited computational domain @xcite or to the early shock - revival @xcite , which has not been discovered by other supernova simulations . in this _ letter _ , we study the properties of the gravitational radiation based on the 3d simulations , which demonstrate the neutrino - driven explosions aided by sasi @xcite . supported by the evidence of the slow rotation prior to core - collapse @xcite , we focus on the asphericities outside the protoneutron stars , which are produced by the growth of sasi . by performing a ray - tracing calculation in 3d @xcite",
    ", we estimate accurately the gravitational waveforms from anisotropic neutrino emissions .",
    "we show that the features of the gravitational waveforms are significantly different than the ones in the axisymmetric cases , which should tell us the necessity of the 3d supernova modeling .",
    "the employed numerical methods and model concepts are essentially the same as those in our previous paper @xcite . using the zeus - mp @xcite as a hydro - solver",
    ", we solve the dynamics of the standing accretion shock flows of matter attracted by the protoneutron star and irradiated by neutrinos emitted from the protoneuton star .",
    "we employ the so - called light - bulb approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and adjust the neutrino luminosities from the pnss to trigger explosions . the computational grid is comprised of 300 logarithmically spaced , radial zones to cover from the absorbing inner boundary of @xmath2 to the outer boundary of @xmath3 , and 30 polar ( @xmath4 ) and 60 azimuthal ( @xmath5 ) uniform mesh points , which are used to cover the whole solid angle ( see for the resolution tests in @xcite ) .",
    "the initial conditions are provided in the same manner of @xcite , which describes the spherically symmetric steady accretion flow through a standing shock wave @xcite . to induce",
    "non - spherical instability we add random velocity perturbations to be less than 1 @xmath6 of the unperturbed velocity . changing the input ( electron-)neutrino luminosity at the surface of the protoneutron star from @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8 , we have computed six 3d models and one 2d model ( see table [ table1 ] . ) except for model e",
    ", we can observe the continuous increase of the average shock radius with the growth of sasi , reaching the outer boundary of the computational domain with the explosion energy of @xmath9 erg . until this moment",
    ", we run the simulations ( e.g. , @xmath10 in the table ) .    following the method in @xcite ,",
    "the two modes of the gws from anisotropic neutrino emissions are derived as follows , @xmath11 ^ 2 + s^2(\\theta')s^2(\\phi ' ) }   \\frac{dl_{\\nu}(\\omega',t')}{d\\omega'},\\nonumber \\label{t+}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath12 ^ 2 + s^2(\\theta')s^2(\\phi ' ) }   \\frac{dl_{\\nu}(\\omega',t')}{d\\omega'},\\nonumber \\label{tcc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , being the gravitational constant , the speed of light , the distance of the source to the observer respectively , @xmath17 represents the direction - dependent neutrino luminosity emitted per unit of solid angle into direction of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the viewing angle ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    ", we consider here two cases , in which the observer is assumed to be situated along polar ( @xmath20 ) or equatorial(@xmath21 ) direction . to determine @xmath17",
    ", we perform a ray - tracing calculation . since the regions outside the pnss are basically thin to neutrinos , we solve the neutrino transport equations in a post - processing manner to estimate the neutrino anisotropy , in which neutrino absorptions and emissions by free nucleons , dominant outside the pnss , are taken into account ( see @xcite for more details ) . to get the numerical convergence ,",
    "we need to set 45000 rays to determine the luminosity for each given direction of @xmath22 .",
    "the gw amplitudes from mass motions are extracted by using the standard quadrupole formula ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and their spectra by @xcite with the fft techniques .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the 3d hydrodynamics features of sasi from the early phase of the non - linear regime of sasi ( top left ) until the shock break - out ( bottom right ) with the gravitational waveform from neutrinos inserted in each panel .",
    "after about @xmath25 ms , the deformation of the standing shock becomes remarkable marking the epoch when the sasi enters the non - linear regime ( top left of figure [ fig1 ] ) . at the same time , the gravitational amplitudes begin to deviate from zero . comparing the top two panels in figure [ fig2 ] , which shows the total amplitudes ( top ) and the neutrino contribution only ( bottom )",
    ", it can be seen that the gross structures of the waveforms are predominantly determined by the neutrino - originated gws with the slower temporal variations ( @xmath26 ms ) , to which the gws from matter motions with rapid temporal variations ( @xmath27 ms ) are superimposed .",
    "so , we first pay attention to the neutrino gws in the following and discuss the importance of the matter gws later in the spectrum analysis .    as seen from the top right through bottom left to right panels of figure [ fig1 ] , the major axis of the growth of sasi",
    "is shown to be not aligned with the symmetric axis ( : @xmath28 axis in the figure ) and the flow inside the standing shock wave is not symmetric with respect to this major axis ( see the first and third quadrant in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is a generic feature in the computed 3d models , which is in contrast to the axisymmetric case .",
    "the gw amplitudes from sasi in 2d showed an increasing trend with time due to the symmetry axis , along which sasi can develop preferentially @xcite .",
    "free from such a restriction , a variety of the waveforms is shown to appear ( see waveforms inserted in figure 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the 3d standing shock can also oscillate in all directions , which leads to the smaller explosion anisotropy than 2d . with these two factors ,",
    "the maximum amplitudes seen either from the equator or the pole becomes smaller than 2d ( compare @xmath29 in table [ table1 ] for models a and a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "their sum in terms of the total radiated energy ( @xmath30 in table [ table1 ] ) are found to be almost comparable between 2d and 3d models , which is likely to imply the energy equipartition with respect to the spatial dimensions .",
    "it was reported in a pioneering 3d study @xcite that the emitted gw energy in the forms of neutrinos was reported to be about 2 orders of magnitude smaller for 3d than in 2d .",
    "however this may be because the global anisotropy of the sasi was not captured in their simulations with the limited computation domain in the polar direction .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the gravitational waveforms for different luminosity models .",
    "the input luminosity for the two pair panels differs only @xmath31 . despite the slight difference",
    ", the waveforms of each polarization are shown to exhibit no systematic similarity when seen from the pole or equator .",
    "this is due to the chaotic nature of sasi influenced by small differences .",
    "no systematic dependence of the maximum amplitudes and the radiated gw energies on the neutrino luminosities is found among the models investigated here ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in fact , the largest emitted gw energy is obtained for model d with the intermediate neutrino luminosity ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is noted that the waveforms are even sensitive to the difference of the grid zoning due to the stochastic nature , although no significant difference in the gw amplitudes is seen in the numerical run with twice as many grid points in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "now we move on to discuss the features of the waveforms by the spectrum analysis . from figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", it can be seen that the neutrino gws , albeit dominant over the matter gws in the lower frequencies below @xmath32 hz , become very difficult to detect for ground - based detectors whose sensitivity is limited mainly by the seismic noises at such lower frequencies @xcite . on the other hand , the gravitational - wave spectra from matter motions peak near @xmath0 hz , reflecting the growth of @xmath33 mode of sasi with timescales of @xmath34 ms .",
    "such signals from a galactic supernova are probably within the detection limits of the ligo - class detectors , and seem surely visible to the next - generation detectors such as the advanced ligo and lcgt .",
    "it is noted that another peak in the gw spectra near @xmath35 1khz is from the rapidly varying matter motions of @xmath36 , induced by the local hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "these gross properties in the gw spectra are found to be common to the other luminosity models .",
    "thus the peak in the spectra near @xmath37hz is a characteristic feature obtained in the 3d models computed here .",
    "we studied the properties of gws based on the 3d simulations , which demonstrate the neutrino - driven explosions with sasi .",
    "we focused on the asphericities outside the protoneutron stars , which are produced by the growth of sasi . by performing a ray - tracing calculation in 3d",
    ", we estimated accurately the gravitational waveforms from anisotropic neutrino emissions .",
    "our results showed that the waveforms vary much more stochastically than for 2d because the explosion anisotropies depend sensitively on the growth of the sasi which develops chaotically in all directions . from the spectra analysis ,",
    "it was pointed out that the gravitational - wave spectra from matter motions peak near @xmath0 hz , reflecting the growth of @xmath33 mode of sasi , and that such signals are probably visible to ligo - class detectors for a galactic source .    here",
    "it should be noted that the simulations highlighted in this paper are only a very first step towards realistic 3d modeling of the supernova explosions .",
    "the approximations adopted in this paper , such as the replacement of the pns by the fixed inner boundary and the light - bulb approach with the constant neutrino luminosity , should be improved .",
    "important ingredients for the gw emissions such as the oscillations of the pnss @xcite and the enhanced neutrino emissions near the equators deep inside the pns observed in @xcite , can not be treated in principle here .",
    "the exploration of these phenomena will require consistent simulations covering the entire stellar core and starting from gravitational collapse with neutrino transfer coupled to the 3d magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "besides , the effects of rotation on the sasi are yet to be investigated @xcite , although the construction of the rotating steady accretion flows is still a major undertaking .",
    "bearing these caveats in mind , the stochastic nature of the gws , which is illuminated here by the 3d models , is qualitatively new .",
    "it should be also mentioned that the gw spectra for the acoustic mechanism showed a very strong peak near @xmath35 khz , reflecting the g - modes oscillations of the pns @xcite , and are significantly different from the waveforms discussed here for the sasi - aided neutrino - driven models .",
    "this means that the successful detection of the gw signals will supply us a powerful tool to probe the explosion mechanism .",
    "recently the next - generation detectors , by which the gws studied here could be surely visible for a galactic source , are planned to be on line soon ( 2014 ! ) @xcite .",
    "here it is an urgent task for theorists to make precise predictions of the gw signals based on more sophisticated 3d supernova modeling .",
