    ", a self - consistent modal theory @xcite , which is equivalent to the coherent density approach , describes the incoherent solitons with the help of a system of coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "similar models appear , in a different physical context , in the theory of soliton wavelength - division multiplexing @xcite , multi - channel bit - parallel - wavelength optical fiber networks @xcite , multi - species and spinor bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and other important applications @xcite . in all such physical models",
    "solitary waves are _ multi - component _ , being described by localized solutions of the coupled nonlinear equations . in some very special cases ,",
    "the coupled system allows for explicit analytical solutions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) but , generally speaking , the nonlinear models with multi - component solitary waves are _",
    "nonintegrable_. stability of solitary waves is therefore a crucial issue for any kind of their applications .",
    "the study of soliton stability has a long history .",
    "stability of one - parameter solitary waves has been already well understood for both fundamental ( single - hump and nodeless ) solitons @xcite and solitons with nodes and multiple humps @xcite .",
    "the pioneering results of vakhitov and kolokolov @xcite found their rigorous justification in a general mathematical theory of grillakis , shatah , and strauss @xcite . although the corresponding stability and instability theorems for the scalar nls models extend formally to the case of multi - parametric solitons @xcite , all the cases analyzed so far correspond to solitary waves with effectively _ a single parameter_.    a recent progress in the study of soliton instabilities is associated with the application of a bifurcation theory valid for _ weakly unstable _ stationary localized waves . in this method ,",
    "the corresponding unstable eigenvalue of the associated spectral problem is treated as a small parameter of multi - scale asymptotic expansions @xcite . in the case of multi - parameter solitary waves , a simplified version of this method",
    "is usually reduced to a number of `` magic determinants '' constructed from the derivatives of the system invariants near a marginal stability line @xcite .",
    "however , such a bifurcation method _ has no rigorous proof _ , and it does not allow to predict the complete domains of the soliton stability and instability , since more general _ oscillatory instabilities _ may occur as well @xcite .    in this paper , we present _ a complete theory _ for stability and instability of _ multi - parameter solitary waves _ considering a particular example of a system of @xmath0 incoherently coupled nls equations .",
    "our results include the asymptotic bifurcation method with the determinant criterion as _ a simple near - threshold limiting case_. they also expand the applicability boundaries of the previously known mathematical theorems @xcite to the case of multi - component and multi - parameter solitary waves .",
    "the system of incoherently coupled nls equations has already been studied in many papers ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite to cite a few ) .",
    "however , the study of stability of single - hump and multi - hump solitary waves was restricted again by a single - parameter case , when soliton components have a similar shape and their amplitudes are proportional to each other @xcite . in this paper , we expand those results and present , for the first time to our knowledge , a complete matrix analysis of the constrained variational problem leading to the finite - dimensional linear algebra .",
    "although some of our results depend on the properties which are specific to the model under consideration , we believe that both the method and the basic results can be generalized , under proper assumptions , to be applied to other types of nonlinear physical models that support multi - parameter solitary waves .",
    "we consider nonlinear interaction of @xmath0 optical modes that describe either a multi - mode structure of a partially incoherent self - trapped beam or incoherent coupling between optical channels with different wavelengths in a fiber .",

    "if the latter condition is not satisfied , as it happens for solitary waves with nodes , the fundamental criterion for the soliton instability can be extended only for a special case @xcite , while more generic mechanisms of oscillatory instabilities , associated with complex eigenvalues of the linear eigenvalue problem , may appear beyond the prediction of the fundamental criterion @xcite .    here",
    "we extend the soliton stability analysis to the case of multi - component solitary waves described by a system of incoherently coupled nls equations ( [ nls ] ) .",
