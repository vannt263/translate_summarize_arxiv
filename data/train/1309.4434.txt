    "the description of nuclear @xmath0 decays requires the introduction of the fermi and gamow - teller nuclear matrix elements that play an analogous role to @xmath23 and @xmath13 in the neutron decay .    if non - standard ( pseudo)scalar interactions are present we need to introduce the following matrix elements in the theoretical description @xmath28 whereas a tensor interaction would introduce an additional hadronic matrix element which is not relevant for our discussion  @xcite .",
    "we can see in eqs .",
    "- how the size of the ( pseudo)scalar charges modulates the sensitivity of @xmath0 decay experiments to non - standard ( pseudo)scalar interactions .",
    "it is worth noticing that the pseudoscalar bilinear @xmath29 is itself of order @xmath30 , what suppresses the contribution of a pseudoscalar interaction  @xcite .",
    "however , we show later how this suppression is partially compensated by an enhanced value of @xmath8 .",
    "using the cvc result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cvc ] ) in combination with the above - given definitions of the form factors appearing in @xmath0 decay , it is straightforward to derive @xmath31 where @xmath32 and once again @xmath17 is the difference of neutron and proton masses in pure qcd due to the explicit breaking of isospin symmetry in the up / down quark masses ( @xmath33 ) . notice that the contribution due to electromagnetic effects @xmath34 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath17 , and so the experimental value can not be used .",
    "the inclusion of qed in the analysis would modify the cvc relation given in eq .   introducing a correction proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , the extra term in this case , @xmath36 , accounts for the ( nonperturbative ) electromagnetic correction to the nucleon mass difference .    in the limit",
    "@xmath37 the expression reduces to @xmath38 up to second order isospin - breaking corrections .",
    "notice that the renormalization - scale and scheme dependence of the light quark masses and @xmath7 is the opposite , in such a way that the dependence in the scalar charge counterbalances the running of @xmath39  @xcite rendering the observable quantity @xmath40 scale independent .",
    "throughout this paper we use the @xmath4 scheme at @xmath5 gev for both the ( pseudo)scalar charges and the light quark masses .    likewise , using pcac in eq .",

    "notice the large enhancement experienced by this form factor that diverges in the chiral limit .",
    "this effect is due to the pole of a charged pion present in the coupling of a pseudoscalar field to the @xmath62 vertex in qcd at low energies .",
    "in fact , this result is equivalent to the goldberger - treiman relation in which the pseudoscalar current serves as an interpolator of the pion field and @xmath63 is expressed as a function with a pole at @xmath64 , whose residue is defined as the strong pion - nucleon coupling ( see e.g. ref .",

    "- do not appear in the sm description of @xmath0 decays . however the contribution due to new physics , like the coupling of a heavy charged scalar to first generation fermions , would require the calculation of these matrix elements .",

    "notice we do not consider interactions involving right - handed neutrinos , that in any case would not interfere with the sm contributions , making their impact on the observable substantially smaller  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "and for the sake of simplicity we will assume in this work that the wilson coefficients @xmath70 are real , corresponding to cp - conserving interactions .",
    "the most stringent limits on non - standard scalar interactions obtained from @xmath0 decays arise from the contribution of the fierz interference term to the @xmath71-values of super - allowed pure fermi transitions @xcite , namely @xmath72 alternative bounds on scalar interactions can be also obtained from the measurement of the @xmath73 angular correlation @xmath74 in pure fermi transitions , also through the fierz term .",
    "although several on - going and planned experiments will improve the current measurements of @xmath74 , it seems unlikely that they will be able to improve the bound given in eq .   in the near future  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fierz term in neutron @xmath0 decay is also sensitive to scalar interactions , although the level of precision required to compete with the bounds from nuclear decays looks also quite challenging , at least for the current generation of experiments  @xcite .",
    "given the experimental measurement of eq .   and",
    "the value of the scalar form factor derived in the previous section , we can determine the current bound on @xmath75 from @xmath0 decays .",

    ", this means that @xmath7 is restricted to remain inside a given interval , namely @xmath77 from eq .  .",
    "notice that all values inside this range are treated on an equal footing , whereas values outside the interval are not permitted .",
    "also note that the bound on @xmath75 depends only on the lower limit of the scalar form factor , as long as @xmath78 is compatible with zero at @xmath79 .    in this way we obtain the following limit on cp - conserving scalar interactions @xmath80 which , as it is shown in fig .",

    "it is worth mentioning that if we abandoned the r - fit scheme and treated @xmath7 as a normally distributed variable we would obtain @xmath81 at 90% cl , in good agreement with the r - fit result of eq .  .",
    "the lhc searches can also be used to set bounds on @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this can be done in a model - independent way if the new degrees of freedom that produce the effective scalar interaction in @xmath0 decays are also too heavy to be produced on - shell at the lhc , since in that case it is possible to study collider observables using a high - energy @xmath82-invariant effective theory that can be connected to the low - energy effective theory of eq .  .",

    "notice that these searches are equally sensitive to scalar and pseudoscalar interactions .      in the study of the effect of non - standard interactions in",
    "nuclear and neutron @xmath0 decays , it is common lore that the pseudoscalar terms can be safely neglected in the analysis because the associated hadronic bilinear @xmath29 is of order @xmath30 , which represents a suppression of order @xmath87 .",
    "however , we showed in the previous section how the application of pcac yields @xmath88 for the pseudoscalar charge , reducing considerably the suppression from the pseudoscalar bilinear .",
    "this result means that , modulo numerical factors of order one , @xmath0 decays with a non - zero gamow - teller component , are as sensitive to pseudoscalar interactions as they are to scalar and tensor couplings .    as a representative example",
    "we show here the leading contribution of a non - zero pseudoscalar interaction to the electron energy spectrum in the @xmath0 decay of an unpolarized neutron @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the electron energy and the modulus of the three - momentum , @xmath92 is the electron endpoint energy and @xmath93 is the electron mass .",

    "this is certainly an interesting result that deserves more detailed studies , in particular related to the sensitivity of current and future @xmath0 decay measurements to @xmath69 .",
    "we hasten to add that the this coupling happens to be very strongly constrained by the helicity - suppressed ratio @xmath101)/\\gamma(\\pi \\to \\mu \\nu [ \\gamma])$ ]  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that there are some possible loopholes in the bound from leptonic pion decays , like the cancellation of effects between the electron and muon channel in @xmath102 due to an @xmath69 coupling proportional to the lepton masses , or cancellations between linear and quadratic terms originated from flavor non - diagonal contributions or interactions with right - handed neutrinos  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the extraction of bounds on the effective pseudoscalar coupling @xmath69 from @xmath0 decays paves the road for studying these scenarios .",
