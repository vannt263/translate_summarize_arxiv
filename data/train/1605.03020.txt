    "smoothness plays an important role in the theory of codimension one foliations of 3-manifolds .",
    "reeb constructed the first @xmath3 foliation on @xmath4 as the union of two foliated solid tori , or reeb components @xcite .",
    "this work of reeb , together with work of alexander @xcite and wallace @xcite , led to the proofs by lickorish @xcite and novikov and zieschang @xcite that any closed 3-manifold has a @xmath3 codimension one foliation . on the other hand",
    ", haefliger @xcite showed that no foliation of @xmath4 can be analytic .",
    "this was greatly improved by novikov @xcite to show that any @xmath1 foliation of @xmath4 must have reeb components , and these never exist in analytic foliations .",
    "the qualitative nature of foliation theory and its impact on the ambient 3-manifold was considerably advanced by thurston s introduction of the norm on the homology of a 3-manifold , and in particular the minimizing properties of leaves of taut , transversely oriented , @xmath1 foliations @xcite .",
    "a foliation is _ taut _ if closed smooth transversals to the foliation pass through every point of the manifold .",
    "this is also known as _ everywhere taut _ to distinguish it from the more familiar notion of _ smoothly taut _ in which closed smooth transversals are only required to intersect every leaf of the foliation . for a discussion of these and other notions of tautness ,",
    "why they are different for @xmath5 foliations , the same for @xmath6 foliations , and interchangeable up to @xmath7 approximation and isotopy of foliations , see @xcite .",
    "foliations as a tool for understanding problems in 3-dimensional topology came to the fore as a result of gabai s constructions of both @xmath8 and often less smooth , but finite depth , taut foliations @xcite .",
    "the success of gabai s applications of foliation theory led to many constructions of taut codimension one foliations .",
    "often these foliations are constructed using denjoy blowup techniques that yield foliations that are only @xmath9 ; that is , leaves are smoothly immersed , but transversely , their tangent plane fields vary only continuously .",
    "the impetus for our work starts with the eliashberg - thurston approximation theorem @xcite .",
    "they showed that a taut , co - oriented codimension one @xmath1 foliation of a 3-manifold can be @xmath7 approximated by a pair of symplectically fillable contact structures .",
    "this allows non - trivial heegaard - floer invariants to be assigned to any manifold that supports a taut foliation @xcite .",
    "this is , consequently , one of the pillars of the conjectural relationship between @xmath10-spaces , taut foliations , and left orderability of the fundamental group . for details ,",
    "see , for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite we extended the eliashberg - thurston approximation theorem to the class of all @xmath11 , co - oriented taut foliations , thereby extending its reach to manifolds carrying the new constructions of foliations mentioned above .",
    "similar results can be found in @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we found that many of the standard tools for working with foliations had either not been developed for foliations with lesser smoothness than originally intended , or had not been developed with an eye towards @xmath7 approximation theory in which it is often necessary to produce a new foliation while only moving the tangent planes of the original foliation slightly .",
    "this paper includes enhancements to well - known results of calegari @xcite on smoothing leaves , dippolito @xcite on denjoy blowup of leaves , and tischler @xcite on approximations by fibrations .",
    "it is possible that some of our results can be obtained by `` reading between the lines '' of the original source .",
    "however , as is well - known , subtleties , sometimes fatal , arise when smooth objects are replaced by objects that are merely continuous .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "these are foundational results in foliation theory , and proofs of these theorems , in the generality in which they are used , do not exist in the literature .",
    "an advantage to the flow box decomposition approach we use is that each of these results can be proved directly with a single inductive strategy .",
    "the methods developed in this paper are not intrinsically 3-dimensional techniques , and we expect they can be adapted to prove corresponding results for codimension one foliations in @xmath2-dimensional manifolds .    basic definitions ( codimension one foliation , flow , @xmath12 compatible , @xmath7 close , and @xmath7 small ) are given in   2 . in ",
    "3 we recall the definition of flow box decomposition , define regular neighborhood structure , and prove a sequence of useful local smoothing results .",
