    "at the present time , eight optical counterparts for gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are known , all of them after detection with the wide field cameras on board the italian - dutch bepposax observatory .",
    "they are : grb 970228 ( groot et al .",
    "1997 ; van paradijs et al . 1997 ) , grb 970508 ( bond 1997 ) , grb 971214 ( halpern et al .",

    "grb 980613 it is possible to speak about the detection of an underlying host galaxy ( hogg & fruchter 1998 ) .",
    "this paper is dedicated to a detailed analysis and interpretation of new @xmath0 photometrical data of the grb970508 host galaxy . since our @xmath0 observations of the optical source related to grb970508 in november 1997 ,",
    "we have continued them in january , july and august 1998 .",
    "these late - time observations were undertaken with the main purpose to check how constant this faint ( @xmath16 ) source is up to 470 days after the gamma - ray burst , i.e. when the contribution of the ot can be considered to be comparable with or even less than the observational errors of brightness estimates in all @xmath0 photometrical bands . these observations do show that the optical counterpart varies very little since november 1997 and allow us to determine the apparent magnitudes of the host galaxy . in this paper",
    "we compared the @xmath0 spectrum of the grb970508 host galaxy with spectral energy distributions of normal galaxies of different hubble types and extended the comparison to include local star - forming galaxies .",
    "table [ tab1 ] presents the results of our observations with the 6-m telescope of sao  ras in november ( @xmath17 band ) and in december 1997 ( @xmath9 band ) , in january , july and august 1998 ( @xmath0 bands ) in one photometric system . the photometrical analysis and details",

    "the presence of absorption lines as characteristic of star formation regions like mgii , mgi and feii ( metzger et al .",
    "1997a ) , evidence for emission line @xmath20   [ oii ] , and the similarity of the observed grb host spectrum to the spectral energy distribution in a scd galaxy prompts us to inquire how the host galaxy is might related to the class of late - type spiral and irregular galaxies . the first step in such",
    "a study is to compare the properties of the grb host galaxy with the galaxies in the local universe , on which we have good knowledge .",
    "the second step is to understand possible deviation from the local galaxy population ( normal , starburst , irregular ) as an effect of evolution and/or selection .",
    "the studies of the local luminosity function of types sd - sm - irr ( see e.g. binggeli et al .",
    "1988 ) indicate that these form a subclass among all galaxies with a knee in the luminosity function at about @xmath21 .",
    "so , the luminosity of the grb host is roughly at the knee of the local luminosity function @xmath13 . though one should note that here the primary selection is not optical but comes from the gamma - ray burst",
    ", this may explain why overluminous galaxies do not dominate among detected grb hosts .    in order to make further comparison between the grb970508 host and local galaxies , especially to utilize the absolute magnitude  linear size relation ( @xmath14 vs.  @xmath22 ) we used the lyon - meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) which currently lists the main astrophysical parameters for more than 165000 galaxies .",
    "the data are collected from the major published galaxy surveys , and complemented with individual measurements .",
    "the parameters have been carefully reduced to a common system ( of de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) and corrected for any instrumental or observational imperfections ( paturel et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the latest information on the status of leda and the data itself are available at http://www - obs.univ - lyon1.fr / leda/. extracted from leda parameters of the galaxies used in the comparison ( figs . 4 and 5 ) with the grb970508 host uv spectra are shown in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the @xmath14 vs.  @xmath22 diagrams for four ranges of galaxy types from leda ( sbc - sc , scd - sd , sm , irr ) .",
    "different types have the well known relation , roughly following the dependence @xmath23 const .",
    "the slope reflects what is expected from discs of different diameters with a constant average surface brightness . @xmath14 and @xmath24 are calculated as @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( total apparent b - magnitude ) , @xmath28 ( log of 25 b - mag / arcsec@xmath29 isophote diameter in units of @xmath30 arcmin ) , and @xmath31 ( radial velocity in km s@xmath3 ) are from leda .",
    "isophotal diameters were corrected for inclination and galactic absorption , and radial velocities for virgo infall .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines in fig .",
    "6 indicate the allowed region of the present grb host galaxy , as based on the absolute magnitudes derived from the models a , b and c.    in order to derive restrictions to the linear size , we use the result from hst measurements of fruchter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : the grb970508 host galaxy has an exponential disk with a scale length @xmath32 of about @xmath33 arcsec .    for a model disk with an exponential distribution of surface brightness from the center to galaxy periphery a simple relation between the central surface brightness @xmath34 ,",
    "the 25 mag / arcsec@xmath29 isophotal angular radius @xmath35 ( in arcsec ) , and the scale length @xmath32 ( @xmath36 ) can be determined as :    @xmath37 if for an exponential ( model ) disk one chooses as observational central surface brightness a value @xmath38 mag / arcsec@xmath29 , then the fraction @xmath36 is @xmath39 . for the angular scale length @xmath40 arcsec ,",
    "the corresponding angular diameter @xmath41 turns out to be equal to @xmath42 arcsec .",
    "the latter angular size of the grb host galaxy corresponds to the isophote of 25 mag / arcsec@xmath29 and is in good agreement with the upper limit of @xmath43 arcsec of the observable size of grb host obtained in previous hst / nicmos observations ( pian at al .",
    "so , the linear diameter @xmath24 would be in the range of @xmath44 4  7 kpc for the a , b , c cosmological models ( 4 ) and the allowed region for @xmath24 is shown by vertical dotted lines in fig",
    "but in that case the grb970508 host galaxy turns out to be in the region of blue compact galaxies with heightened central surface brightness . in other words",
    "the galaxy is on the same line in fig .",
    "6 ( scd  sd ) @xmath45 const where the blue compact mrk 1267 with the continuum spectra ( see fig .",
    "it good corresponds of the agreement ( mentioned above , see fig .",
    "4 ) the continuum uv spectrum with the @xmath0 broad - band grb host spectrum .",
    "the present late - time observations of the optical counterpart grb970508 allows us to think that in 470 days after the grb the observed @xmath0 fluxes can be attributed only to the grb host galaxy .",
    "the contribution of ot ( if any at all ) is already less than observational errors .",
    "it allows us to calculate the intrinsic parameters of the grb970508 host galaxy and to make the first step in the study of the properties of the grb host galaxy by the comparison with the properties of galaxies in the local universe , on which we have good knowledge .",
    "but for the grb redshift @xmath46 , the derived absolute magnitude and diameter , needed for comparison with local galaxies , depend on the adopted cosmological model .",
    "a change in the model parameters easily produces a change of 1 mag in the absolute magnitude of the host galaxy and a change of @xmath44 50% in diameter .",
    "we have measured the @xmath47 corrections for the grb970508 host galaxy and the neighbouring g2 galaxy , which are + 0.6 and + 2.1 , respectively .",
    "such corrections make absolute magnitudes brighter and shift them away from dwarf galaxies .",
    "the position and luminosity of one of the neighbouring g2 allows it to produce the @xmath48 absorption line system in the spectrum of the grb970508 ot on 11 may 1997 .",
    "the intrinsic physical properties of the possible host galaxy for grb970508 correspond to a late - type galaxy , with its @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( depending on the cosmological model ) clearly fainter than the knee of the general schechter luminosity function at about @xmath51 mag .",
    "however as demonstrated by binggeli et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , the luminosity function essentially depends on the type of galaxies and their environment ( field and clusters ) . for sd + sm galaxies",
    "the knee of the luminosity function is at @xmath52 and hence the detected host of grb970508 would be from the bright end for this galaxy type range . in terms of the classification by binggeli ( 1994 )",
    ", the host belongs to his sequence 3 and lies well away from the border between normal and dwarf galaxies traditionally taken to be around @xmath53 .",
    "the spectral distributions of normal galaxies with types earlier than sbc are confidently excluded for grb970508 host galaxy .",
    "the comparison of the spectral distribution of the host galaxy with local starburst galaxies revealed that the best fits were given by the  galaxy ngc7793 and the blue compact galaxy mrk 1267 . position of the host galaxy in the @xmath14 vs. @xmath15 diagram for local late - type leda galaxies and an analysis of the angular diameter of its disc using the scale length of about @xmath33 arcsec from fruchter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) give evidence for a higher than normal surface brightness .",
    "the latter , together with the closeness of the spectral distribution for mrk 1267 in the uv range of spectrum , allows us to attribute grb970508 host galaxy to the blue compact galaxies .",
    "altogether , the observed absorption lines mgii , mgi and feii , the evidence for emission line [ oii ] and evidence for a high surface brightness are consistent with a starburst process going on in the present grb host galaxy .    this work has been partly supported by the academy of finland ( project  cosmology in the local galaxy universe \" ) .",
