    "another problem that has also found many applications in the study of meson physics is that of fermions interacting with potentials of scalar and pseudoscalar natures , particularly in the context of the fractionization of the baryon number in the vacuum due to the topological configurations of the classical backgrounds @xcite . in this regard",
