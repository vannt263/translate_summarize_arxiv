    "cosmology has been characterized as the search for two numbers @xcite : @xmath0 , the present expansion rate , and @xmath1 , the present deceleration parameter .",
    "few would argue with the statement that cosmology is a much grander enterprise today , and that our  world model \" is better described by a larger set of physically motivated parameters , including the energy densities of radiation , dark matter , dark energy , and the equation of state of dark energy .    in this paper",
    "we show that in fact , the deceleration parameter can not be directly measured using distance indicators with both accuracy and precision . that is , @xmath1 can not be determined with statistical precision ( small error bar ) without incurring a bias away from the true value .",
    "while @xmath0 can be measured with both accuracy and precision , avoiding a slightly biased measurement requires a better choice of parameters than @xmath0 and @xmath1 , e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "sandage introduced @xmath0 and @xmath1 to provide a model - independent , kinematic description of the expansion of the universe .",
    "this description begins with a taylor series for the cosmic scale factor @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . using the definition of redshift , @xmath10 , and luminosity distance , @xmath11 , and the above expansion",
    ", the observable luminosity distance can be expressed in a taylor series in redshift @xmath12 note too , that no assumption about the validity of general relativity has been made ; only that spacetime is isotropic and homogeneous and described by a metric theory .",
    "we note that the next order term  the jerk parameter @xmath13may be added ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath181 , or 1 for a flat , open , or closed universe , respectively .",
    "the power of the @xmath19 ( or quadratic ) expansion is that , in principle , measurements of @xmath20 can be used to determine the present expansion rate  arguably the most important number in all of cosmology  and the deceleration parameter .",
    "moreover , in the simple matter - only cosmology of the time , general relativity , through the friedmann equations , relates @xmath1 to the physical parameter , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the present matter density and @xmath23 is the present critical density :    @xmath24    further , in this model , @xmath1 is related to the spatial curvature and destiny of the universe : if @xmath1 is greater than @xmath25 , @xmath26 is greater than unity and the universe is positively curved and will ultimately re - collapse ; conversely , if @xmath1 is less than 1/2 , @xmath26 is less than 1 and the universe is negatively curved and will expand forever .",
    "the case of @xmath27 is the flat universe that expands forever at an ever slowing rate .",
    "this is all well and good ; the question we address here is whether these two ( or three ) , model - independent parameters can in fact be measured .",
    "the answer is simple : only @xmath0 can be measured with accuracy and precision .",
    "the explanation is simple as well : at low redshifts , say @xmath28 , where the taylor expansion is most accurate , poor leverage on @xmath1 ( and @xmath13 ) and peculiar velocities severely limit the precision ; at higher redshifts , where the effect of peculiar velocities is negligible and the leverage is greater , the quadratic expansion does not accurately approximate @xmath20 ( see figure [ fig : hubble_exp ] ) and a bias is introduced in the measurement .",
    "one can measure @xmath1 either with precision ( use measurements extending to high redshift ) , or with accuracy ( restrict the measurements to low redshift ) .",
    "we also show that including the cubic term in the model - independent expansion ",
    "jerk @xmath13does change this conclusion .    moreover , while one might be tempted to simply abandon @xmath1 and @xmath13 given these complications , in fact they have found use recently to avoid a bias of order @xmath29 that otherwise inflicts direct measurements of @xmath0 due to the less accurate linear expansion @xcite . to better avoid such biases ,",
    "we explore other two- or three - parameter descriptions of @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the pair @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( where flatness and @xmath3 are assumed ) eliminates this small bias in measuring @xmath0 and is better motivated .",
    "we use the constitution compilation of supernovae @xcite to concretely illustrate of our findings .",
    "finally , we briefly address how @xmath1 might be measured with accuracy and precision by exploiting the very small time evolution of redshifts-of the order of cm s@xmath31 decade@xmath31known as redshift drift ( sandage 1962 ; loeb 1998 ) .",

    "the reasons are simple : at low redshifts , where the @xmath30 expansion is accurate , the combination of peculiar velocities and the small change in @xmath30 for different values of @xmath1 ( lack of leverage ) makes @xmath1 impossible to measure with any precision . at higher redshift , where there is leverage and precision is possible , the inaccuracy of the @xmath19 expansion strongly biases estimates of @xmath1 .",
