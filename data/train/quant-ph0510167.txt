    "can the experimenter s free - will be experimentally tested ?",
    "it seems unreasonable to expect that this question can be answered unconditionally . the philosophical debate on whether or not our choices",
    "are ultimately up to ourselves or are just a predetermined illusion has lasted for centuries without reaching a final conclusion . here",
    "we pursue our profession as physicists reminding ourselves of einstein s words that  it is the theory which decides what we can observe  .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , one could say that it is the theory that decides whether or not the experimenter s free - will can be tested . here",
    "we consider the experimenter s freedom of choosing between different possible measurement settings and argue that , _ within a local realistic theory _ , it can experimentally be tested .",
    "following gill _",
    "et al_.  @xcite this freedom will be defined as the _ independence _ of the experimenter s choice of measurement settings from the local realistic mechanism that determines the actual measurement results .    the theorem of john bell  @xcite states the impossibility of a local realistic explanation of quantum mechanics in which the experimenter has a freedom to choose between different experimental arrangements .",
    "this is demonstrated by the experimental confirmation of the violation of bell s inequalities in agreement with quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "the philosophical implications of bell s theorem are startling : either one must abandon the experimenter s freedom , or the view that external reality exists prior to and independent of observations ( realism ) , or dramatically revise our concepts of space and time ( locality ) .",
    "needless to say , either of the choices requires radical revision of the ruling philosophical view of most of the scientists and is in sharp contrast to our every - day experience .",
    "if one chooses to keep a local realistic picture and to deny the experimenter s freedom , then one must accept a world in which the measurement settings that are generated by the experimenter s choice ( or by tossing a coin , or  to put it in a grotesque way  by the parity of the number of cars passing the laboratory within @xmath0 seconds , where @xmath0 is given by the fourth decimal of the cube of the actual temperature in degrees fahrenheit ) are determined in advance and correlated with the actual outcome of the measurement .",
    "bell himself comments such theories with the words  @xcite :  a theory may appear in which such conspiracies inevitably occur , and these conspiracies may then seem more digestible than the non - localities of other theories .",
    "when that theory is announced i will not refuse to listen , either on methodological or other grounds .",
    "but i will not myself try to make such a theory .     in this paper",
    "we show that the experimentally observed degree of violation of bell s inequalities sets a minimal degree to which the free choice has to be abandoned if one insists on a local realistic explanation .",
    "thus , not every local realistic theory denying free choice is in agreement with observations .",
    "finally , extending the idea of hwang  @xcite , we argue that the experimenter s freedom can be considered as a resource in quantum communication as its lacking can be used by an eavesdropper to harm its security .",
    "we analyze the security in quantum key distribution as a function of the knowledge the eavesdropper has about the choice of measurement settings which is made by the authorized parties in the protocol .",
    "_ realism _ supposes that the measurement results are determined by ",
    "hidden variables  which exist prior to and independent of observation .",
    "_ locality _ supposes that the results obtained at one location are independent of any measurements or actions performed at space - like separated regions . finally , _",
    " freedom of choice  _ assumes that the experimenter s choice of the measurement setting is independent of the local realistic mechanism which determines the measurement results . in what follows we",
    "pursue the approach of gill _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in formulating these concepts in a mathematically rigorous way .",
    "consider two spatially separated partners , alice and bob , performing space - like separated experiments on particles which are pairwise emitted by some source .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the _ actual _ measurement outcomes obtained , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 the actual measurement settings chosen by alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the outcomes @xmath1 and @xmath2 can take values @xmath5 or @xmath6 , and the settings @xmath3 and @xmath4 values @xmath7 or @xmath8 . the probability to observe the two outcomes to be equal , @xmath9 , under the chosen @xmath3 ( alice ) and @xmath4 ( bob )",
    "is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "local realism assumes the existence of a quadruple of variables @xmath11 , each taking values @xmath5 or @xmath6 , which represents the _ potential _ measurement outcomes in a thought experiment , under any of the possible measurement settings .",
    "this quadruple exists independently of whether any or which experiment is actually performed on either side . because of locality the variables on alice s side",
    "do not depend on the choice of setting on bob s side , and vice versa .",
    "thus , local realism requires @xmath12 and @xmath13    the freedom assumption expresses the independence between the choice @xmath14 of the measurement settings and the local realistic mechanism which finally selects the actual outcomes @xmath15 from the potential ones @xmath16 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite put this formally in the requirement that @xmath17 are statistically independent of @xmath11 .",
    "this means that in many thought repetitions of the experiment the probabilities with which the quadruple @xmath18 takes on any of its @xmath19 possible values remain the same within each subensemble defined by the four possible combinations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the ( mathematical ) probability for having @xmath22 .",
    "what if the experimenter s freedom is just an illusion ?",
    "imagine that the choices of experimental settings and experimental results are both consequences of some common local realistic mechanism .",
    "in such a case the two probabilities @xmath21 and @xmath10 may differ from each other and we use their difference @xmath23 to measure the lack of freedom .",
    "this measure can acquire values from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and the freedom case corresponds to all @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to note that while the probabilities @xmath10 can directly be measured , the @xmath21 are only mathematical entities of the local realistic theory without a direct operational meaning .",
    "nevertheless , they satisfy a set - theoretical constraint which is mathematically equivalent to the clauser  horne  shimony ",
    "holt ( chsh ) inequality  @xcite .",
    "the product of local realistic results @xmath25 is always equal to the multiplication of @xmath26 , because the square of a dichotomic variable , with values @xmath5 or @xmath6 , is equal to @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the following expression can attain only one of two values @xcite:@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the indicator of the event @xmath29 , i.e. , it is equal to @xmath7 if it happens and @xmath30 if it does not happen .",
    "the expectation value of the indicator variable is the probability for the event to happen , @xmath21 .",
    "finally the expectation value of the left - hand side can not be greater than the maximum value of the averaged expression:@xmath31 the equivalence to the chsh inequality is evident as soon as one recalls that the correlation function of dichotomic variables equals @xmath32 .",
    "the above inequality , in turn , implies a new bound on the set of probabilities that can experimentally be measured:@xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "note that on the basis of measured probabilities ( relative frequencies ) one can not make statements about the individual measures @xmath35 but rather on their combination as given in @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , it is possible that @xmath37 , although all the individual @xmath38 , and it may also be negative",
    ". however , only the case of positive @xmath39  implying at least one individual @xmath35 to be unequal to zero  makes the freedom assumption within a local realistic model experimentally testable , as the bound on the right - hand side of ( [ delta ] ) is increased .",
    "as well one could study the lower bounds of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    to give an example of the lack of freedom model , imagine a local realistic mechanism in which the source  knows  in advance the settings `` to be chosen '' by alice and bob .",
    "the source can  arbitrarily  manipulate the value of @xmath41 in this case .",
    "even the algebraic ( logical ) bound of @xmath42 can be reached : whenever alice and bob both measure the second setting , the source sends ( local realistic ) correlated pairs such that the measurement results anticoincide , i.e.  @xmath43 , and in all other measurements it produces pairs for which the results coincide , i.e.  @xmath44 , and thus @xmath42 .",
    "for this local realistic model ( without freedom ) inequality ( [ delta ] ) is satisfied , but only because of the adapted bound @xmath45 .",
    "now imagine another experiment , in which the observers ( freely ) choose their settings independently from the local realistic source .",
    "then @xmath46 , i.e.  @xmath47 , and inequality ( [ delta ] ) is fulfilled with the bound of 2 , as it becomes the chsh inequality ( [ kids ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath39 for which the inequality is still satisfied , defines the minimal extent to which the experimenter s freedom has to be abandoned such that a local realistic explanation of the experiment is still possible .",
    "denote the left - hand side of inequality  ( [ delta ] ) as the chsh expression .",
    "the maximal possible quantum value , @xmath48 , of this expression can be observed for the maximally entangled state , for example , the singlet state @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are two orthogonal quantum states , and for an appropriate choice of possible settings @xmath17 .",
    "this quantum value requires an abandonment of the experimentalist s freedom to the extent of at least @xmath52 .    since , based on the experiment , we can only make statements about @xmath39 , a large number of local realistic theories are possible that deny the experimenter s freedom and are in agreement with quantum mechanical predictions and experiments . in order to be able to make further statements about these theories we need to impose some structure on them . in what follows",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the degree to which the freedom is abandoned  that is the absolute value of the measure @xmath35  is independent of the actual experiment performed , i.e.  @xmath53 is the same for all @xmath14 . roughly speaking",
    ", the level of conspiracy is assumed to be the same for all experimental situations .",
    "choosing @xmath54 one obtains @xmath55 for the minimal degree required to explain the quantum value of the chsh expression by a local realistic model . if all the @xmath35 are positive ( i.e.  if @xmath56 for all @xmath14 ) , one finds the even higher value @xmath57 .",
    "it is known that with an increasing number of parties , @xmath58 , the discrepancy between the results of bell tests and local realistic predictions that respect the experimenter s freedom increases rapidly ( exponentially ) with @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "we now determine how the degree of the lack of freedom needs to scale with @xmath58 in a local realistic theory that agrees with these tests .",
    "consider @xmath58 space - like separated parties who can each choose between two possible measurement settings .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the actual measurement result obtained and @xmath60 the actual measurement setting chosen by party @xmath61 .",
    "the probability to observe correlation , i.e.  the probability that the product of local results is equal to @xmath7 if settings @xmath62 are chosen , is denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "local realism assumes the existence of @xmath64 numbers @xmath65 , each taking values @xmath5 or @xmath6 and representing the potential measurement outcomes of @xmath58 parties under any possible combination of their measurement settings .",
    "the ( mathematical ) probability that the product of the potential outcomes is equal to @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "note again that this probability can not be measured experimentally .",
    "we apply the approach used above to the present case of @xmath58 parties .",
    "we introduce the difference@xmath67 to measure the lack of freedom of @xmath58 experimenters .",
    "the probabilities @xmath66 satisfy a set - theoretical constraint that is mathematically equivalent to the mermin inequality  @xcite ( the particular form used here is from  @xcite):@xmath68 where @xmath69   $ ] are coefficients taking values @xmath30 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the inequality is bounded by @xmath70   $ ] , where @xmath71 is the greatest integer less or equal to @xmath72 . using inequality  ( [ cave ] ) and definition  ( [ cold ] )",
    ", one obtains a new inequality:@xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "importantly , the probabilities entering this inequality are measurable .    in a bell experiment involving the maximally entangled @xmath58-party ( ghz ) state one observes @xmath75",
    "$ ] for the maximal possible value of the left - hand side of inequality  ( [ you ] ) .",
    "this implies @xmath76 for the minimal value of @xmath77 that still allows a local realistic explanation of the experiment .",
    "suppose again that the degree of the lack of freedom is independent of the measurement setting . with an adequate choice of signs",
    "one has @xmath78 for @xmath3 s for which @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath3 s for which @xmath81 .",
    "this results in @xmath82 .",
    "finally , one obtains that the degree to which the experimenter s freedom has to be abandoned in order to have an agreement between local realism and bell s experiments with @xmath58 parties _ saturates exponentially fast _ with @xmath58 as @xmath83 . in the limit of infinitely many partners",
    "@xmath84 reaches the value of @xmath85 .",
    "it is remarkable that if the sign of all @xmath86 is chosen positive , there will be no way to obtain agreement between local realism and the experimental results , since @xmath84 would have to leave the range from @xmath6 to @xmath5 in the limit of large @xmath58 .",
    "the other argument which invalidates all @xmath86 to be positive involves only four parties .",
    "in this case in the expression defined in ( [ you ] ) the number of probabilities with a positive sign is equal to the number of probabilities with a negative sign .",
    "thus , if all @xmath86 are positive and have the same value they cancel each other , i.e.  @xmath87 , and no explanation of the violation of the bound @xmath88 is possible .    in this section we showed that quantum correlations for @xmath58 partners can be explained within local realism only if both the number of measurement settings in which the experimenter s freedom is abandoned ( all @xmath89 combinations of local settings entering the mermin inequality ) increases exponentially and the degree of this abandonment saturates exponentially fast with @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , from the viewpoint of local realism that denies freedom , there is no obvious reason why the quantum bound of the chsh inequality is @xmath90 and not , for example , the maximal possible logical bound of 3 . in our opinion these objections clearly show that the local realistic program goes squarely against every effort for simple and sensible explanations of our observations . in particular , in order to explain the violation of bell s inequality within local realism , one has to introduce purely theoretical and experimentally not accessible entities such as the ( mathematical ) probabilities @xmath91 .",
    "this is against the spirit of ockham s razor principle .",
    "the violation of bell s inequality by legitimate parties was found to be a necessary and sufficient condition for their efficient extraction of a quantum secret key  @xcite , showing an appealing connection between secure key distribution and the violation of local realism .",
    "apart from its fundamental meaning , the freedom to choose between different measurement settings can be regarded as an important resource in quantum secret key distribution . in particular , as recently shown by hwang  @xcite , an eavesdropper can both simulate the violation of bell s inequality and successfully eavesdrop , if the freedom in choosing the settings by legitimate partners is abandoned .",
    "effectively , one can assume that each measurement device chooses its settings according to a pseudo - random sequence that is installed in the device beforehand .",
    "such a model of lack of freedom allows the eavesdropper to know the algorithm generating the pseudo - random numbers , at least to some extent , and correspondingly predict the future measurement settings of the legitimate parties .",
    "in what follows we will consider an ekert - like protocol  @xcite  a combination of the bbm92 protocol  @xcite ( which is an application of the bb84 protocol  @xcite to entangled states ) and a chsh test  and analyze both the violation of bell s inequality and the security of the key distribution as a function of the amount of knowledge that the eavesdropper eve ( e ) has about the settings chosen by the legitimate parties alice ( a ) and bob ( b ) .",
    "we have chosen this combination of bbm92 and chsh  henceforth denoted as the bbm  chsh protocol  because it allows to test the relationship between bell s theorem and secure quantum key distribution in a single protocol .",
    "( in contrast to the original ekert protocol with non - orthogonal key establishing settings , there is a security proof for the bbm92 attached to the error rate . )",
    "consider a source that emits pairs of spin-@xmath85 particles in the singlet state @xmath92 denote spin - up and spin - down along the @xmath93-direction , respectively .",
    "the legitimate parties measure the incoming particles in the @xmath94-plane .",
    "alice can choose between two orthogonal settings , characterized by the azimuthal angles @xmath95 and @xmath96 , whereas bob has 4 possible measurement directions , namely @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 ( note that the @xmath101 are not numbered in ascending order ) .",
    "therefore , depending on their choice of settings , they sometimes measure correlations for determining the violation of the chsh inequality , namely with the 4 settings @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , or they can establish a key , since their outcomes are perfectly anti - correlated for measurements along @xmath106 and @xmath107 . if they choose @xmath108 or @xmath109 , i.e.  orthogonal directions , they discard their results .",
    "a schematic of the measurement directions is shown in figure  [ fig_setting ] .     and",
    "@xmath110 , whereas bob has four different possibilities , namely the same directions as alice , i.e. , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , as well as two directions rotated by @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath114 and @xmath115 . ]",
    "let @xmath116 denote the probability that alice and bob obtain anti - correlated results if they measure along @xmath117 and @xmath101 , respectively , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 . within the freedom assumption",
    "the ( measured ) chsh expression has the form@xmath120 for the ( maximally entangled ) singlet state it is equal to @xmath90 .",
    "the classical bound is 2 , whereas the logical bound is equal to 3 .",
    "let us now assume that an eavesdropper , eve , has some knowledge about the choice of settings of alice and bob , for instance by having some insight into their random number generators . we _ model _",
    "this knowledge in the following way : in each run , i.e. , for each singlet pair , eve knows that the combination of local settings @xmath121 will happen with probability @xmath122 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that one out of the 8 joint settings will happen with ( high ) probability @xmath123 , whereas all the others 7 have equal ( low ) probability @xmath124 to be manifested . the number @xmath125 shall be the same for all runs ; the setting which it indicates to be most probable of course changes from run to run .",
    "the case @xmath126 corresponds to perfect knowledge of the eavesdropper and to the complete lack of free will of alice and bob , whereas @xmath127 means that eve has no knowledge at all .",
    "now we impose the following _ attack algorithm _ : if eve believes one of the chsh settings to be most likely , she sends the corresponding optimal product state . in general ,",
    "if @xmath128 , which means that the setting @xmath121 is most probable from eve s viewpoint , she intercepts and sends either @xmath129 or @xmath130 ( by tossing a fair coin , such that the local results of alice and bob are always totally random ) . only in the special case @xmath131 ,",
    "eve sends @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "this is the chsh setting where the probability of anti - correlation should be minimized , since @xmath134 appears with a minus sign in the chsh inequality .",
    "therefore , she attacks the chsh measurements in order to achieve a maximal violation ( @xmath135 ) _ and _ the key establishing measurements to find the key ( or rather produce it herself ) .    to further motivate why we have chosen this attack algorithm",
    ", we note that ( i ) it is canonical in the way that eve attacks all events in the same way , namely with the appropriate product state .",
    "( ii ) the attack is already good enough to show that the connection between violation of local realism and secure key distribution is lost in the case where the eavesdropper has partial knowledge about the settings .",
    "( iii ) eve sends a product state for each pair that is generated by the source ; hence , alice and bob are faced with measurement results that can be described by local realism but nevertheless can violate the chsh inequality ( [ chsh ( bbm ) ] ) due to restricted freedom .    according to eve s setting knowledge and the attack strategy , one can compute the value for the chsh expression as measured by alice and bob . _ in the subensemble _ of cases where , e.g. , alice measures along @xmath136 and bob along @xmath114 , eve sends with probability @xmath125 the product states resulting in anti - correlations @xmath137 .",
    "in the rest of the cases she sends 7 possible ",
    "wrong guesses  which each happen with probability @xmath124 and for each of them the probability for anti - correlations takes values between @xmath85 and @xmath138 , depending on the specific wrong attack .",
    "the measured probability @xmath139 is the expectation value of all 8 sets of anti - correlated results weighted with their probabilities to happen .",
    "analogously , the probabilities for anti - correlation in the other subensembles are calculated and we find @xmath140 the chsh expression finally results in @xmath141 thus , the logical bound @xmath142 is reached in the limit @xmath143 .",
    "the classical bound of @xmath144 is beaten for all @xmath145 and the quantum mechanics ( cirelson ) bound @xmath146 is beaten for setting knowledge @xmath147 . if @xmath125 is larger than @xmath148 , eve should reduce the strength of her attack , e.g.  by mixing some noise into her product states , for otherwise even the quantum bound would be broken .",

    "we have to compute mutual informations between the parties . the mutual information between alice and bob is determined by the bit error rate  @xcite which they can compute in the _ subensembles _ where they measured along @xmath164 or @xmath165 .",

    "the maximal mutual information between alice ( or bob for symmetry reasons ) and eve from alice s and bob s viewpoint , which can be attained by an optimal attack of eve for a given error rate @xmath166 and _ under the condition that eve has no setting knowledge _ , is given by  @xcite @xmath171    the _ actual _ mutual information between alice and eve , @xmath172 , can be computed from the conditional entropy @xmath173 by @xmath174 , where alice s shannon information is @xmath175 , since the outcomes of alice are always locally random for all possible attacks .",

    "thus , @xmath179 and @xmath180 analogously , one can find the _ actual _ mutual information between bob and eve : @xmath181 which is always smaller than ( or equal to ) @xmath172 .",

    "nonetheless they can not extract a secret key ( @xmath193 , @xmath196 ) .",

    "a violation of this new bound is equivalent to statement that the classical bound 2 is violated in the case of total freedom and for this situation there exists a complete equivalence between the chsh inequality violation and the security of the bbm protocol  @xcite .",
    "the violation of bell s inequalities is an experimental fact . within a local realistic program",
    "this fact can only be explained if the experimenter s freedom in choosing between different measurement settings is denied ( modulo known loopholes , considered by most scientists to be of technical nature ) . for a local realist",
    "our results show that both the number of settings in which the freedom is abandoned grows exponentially and the degree of this abandonment saturates exponentially fast with the number of parties . for the present authors , however , these results are rather an indication of the absurdity of the program itself . nevertheless , they give rise to new security criteria for quantum cryptography in situations in which the measurement settings chosen by the authorized parties are partially revealed by an eavesdropper .",
    "this contradicts the standard assumption in cryptography in which the laboratories of the authorized parties are safe and no relevant information is allowed to leak out from them .",
    "if this assumption is not fulfilled , we showed that the violation of the standard chsh inequality is not equivalent to a secure key distribution anymore .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to define a new ( higher ) bound whose violation indeed guarantees the security of the key .",
    "therefore , one can keep the security while , to some extent , relaxing the assumption that no information is revealed to an eavesdropper , as long as the amount of this information is known .",
