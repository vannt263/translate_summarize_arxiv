    "the phenomenon of entropy concentration was first demonstrated by e.t .",
    "jaynes @xcite , who called it , perhaps more appropriately , `` concentration of distributions at entropy maxima '' .",
    "entropy concentration provides a powerful justification for the application of the maximum entropy principle ( maxent ) in a variety of settings . in @xcite",
    "we presented a discrete , combinatorial setting , entirely devoid of probabilities and asymptotics , for entropy concentration . from @xmath0 units we constructed objects with @xmath1 parts , which can be thought of as allocating @xmath0 balls to @xmath1 bins , and characterized the objects by their frequency vectors , defining the fraction of units allocated to each of the parts .",
    "only certain allocations were admissible , those that satisfied a set of linear equalities and inequalities involving the @xmath1 elements of the frequency vector .    in this purely combinatorial setting ,",
    "the concentration phenomenon is that as @xmath0 becomes larger , the overwhelming majority of the allocations which accord with the constraints have frequency vectors that are close to the @xmath1-vector which maximizes the entropy subject to the constraints ; the closeness can be measured either by the entropy values of the vectors , or by the norm of their difference from the vector of maximum entropy . in a problem where the only available information is embodied in the constraints , and which otherwise admits a large number of solutions , the concentration phenomenon provides a powerful argument for selecting a particular solution , the one with maximum entropy , in preference to all others .    here",
    "we study a generalization , or relaxation , of this combinatorial setting , where there is no pre - specified number @xmath0 of units to be allocated to the @xmath1 parts . instead of frequency vectors",
    ", we therefore deal with even more basic entities , _ count _ vectors .",
    "linear equality and inequality constraints are placed on the counts .",
    "different count vectors sum to different totals , but we assume that the constraints limit the possible sums to lie within a finite interval .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that all the counts are bounded , so here we are dealing simply with the construction of _ bounded _ objects of a specified number of parts .",
    "the switch from frequency to count vectors also requires a new , generalized , entropy function in which the _ sum _ of the count vector whose entropy we are calculating plays a role . like the ordinary , shannon entropy",
    ", this generalized entropy is an approximation to the log of the multinomial coefficient giving the number of allocations that result in a particular count vector , except that here the numerator , which represents the sum , is also variable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that a concentration phenomenon arises even in this more general or relaxed setting , and to quantify the concentration in terms of various parameters without any asymptotic considerations , similarly to what was done in @xcite .    for the discrete setting in which we are studying concentration , the `` balls and bins '' paradigm for the construction of our objects",
    "is very useful .",
    "we are given @xmath1 labelled bins , and a large , but unspecified number of identical balls , indistinguishability is essential . ] .",
    "balls are placed into the bins one - by - one , so that an assignment of balls @xmath2 corresponds to a sequence of @xmath3 bin labels .",
    "any assignment results in a certain number of balls in each bin , summarized in a count vector @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "the total number @xmath6 of balls that ends up in the bins after an assignment can be any number @xmath0 allowed by the constraints .",
    "we are concerned with the assignments , or sequences of bin labels , whose count vectors satisfy the constraints .    we stress that this general setting is not the same as that of maxent . with the extra freedom allowed by the absence of the normalization constraint ,",
    "_ it is not a priori clear _ that any concentration should occur at all . and",
    "if it does , one might expect that it would do so when the number of balls is the largest allowable by the constraints .",
    "[ ex : first]you are given a large number of identical balls , and are asked to place them one - by - one in three bins which are colored red , green , and blue .",
    "the final numbers @xmath7 of balls in the bins must satisfy @xmath8 and @xmath9 . given these constraints , the total number of balls that may be put in the bins can not be too small , e.g. 3 , or too large , e.g. 20 .",
    "we can think of each assignment of balls to the bins as described by a sequence made out of the letters @xmath10 .",
    "the number of @xmath11s plus the number of @xmath12s in the sequence must be 4 whereas the number of @xmath12s plus the number of @xmath13s must be at most 6 ; the sequence can be of _ any _ length consistent with these requirements .",
    "to each such sequence corresponds a count vector @xmath14 .",
    "table [ tab : ass ] lists all the count vectors that accord with the constraints , their sum @xmath0 , and the number of _ realizations _ of each , i.e. the number of sequences or assignments that result in these counts ; this number is given by a multinomial coefficient , e.g. @xmath15 .",
    "l    .[tab : ass]the count vectors @xmath14 satisfying @xmath16 , their sum @xmath0 , and the number of realizations of each . if the second constraint is changed to an equality , only the highlighted rows are possible .",
    "if we knew that , e.g. , @xmath17 , only that section of the table would apply and we would reduce to the maxent problem studied in @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      by theorem 11.1.3 of @xcite , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",

    "a drawback of theorem [ th : ref ] is that the constraint data @xmath106 does not appear in the results ( only implicitly , and to some extent , via @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ) , and intuition says that the concentration _ should _ depend on this data .",
    "the root of the issue is that the upper bound on @xmath109 derived in [ sec : ubb ] ignores the constraints when it bounds the number of lattice points in the polytope @xmath110 simply by @xmath111 .",
