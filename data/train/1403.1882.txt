    "a central problem in the theory of strongly coupled plasmas is to describe how the many body physics of correlations affects transport properties .",
    "traditional plasmas are so hot and dilute that the average particle kinetic energy greatly exceeds the potential energy of interaction . in this weakly coupled regime , interactions are long range and coulomb collisions are accurately modeled as a series of small - angle binary scattering events.@xcite in contrast , the interaction potential energy exceeds the average particle kinetic energy in strongly coupled plasmas , so theory must account for both large angle collisions and many - body correlations .",
    "we recently proposed a method for extending the binary collision picture to strong coupling by accounting for correlations through an effective interaction potential.@xcite in the present paper , this approach is developed further by detailing aspects of the analysis that were not included in the previous publication and by drawing connections with weakly coupled plasma theory .",
    "this physically intuitive approach provides a practical means of extending the most commonly applied transport theories to stronger coupling",
    ". it may find application in ultracold plasmas,@xcite dense plasmas,@xcite and dusty plasmas@xcite where strong coupling effects can influence transport .",
    "it is especially advantageous for modeling systems in which the coupling strength can vary from weak to strong because it fits naturally within the framework of the chapman - enkog@xcite or grad@xcite methods , providing the transport coefficients that the macroscopic fluid descriptions require as input .",
    "the plasmas of interest are often multicomponent systems exhibiting a wide range of parameters .",
    "fluid simulations typically demand that calls to routines providing transport coefficients be fast , such as a table lookup or evaluation of a closed - form equation .",
    "one approach is to build tables or best fit curves based on many ab - initio simulations , but this quickly becomes impractical for multicomponent plasmas when a large parameter space is required . alternatively",
    ", approximate theories can be sought that balance accuracy and computational expense , while also providing insight into the physical processes at play . along these lines",
    ", we explore the extent to which the conventional binary scattering picture can be extended by using an effective interaction potential that includes correlation physics .",
    "the idea of imposing an effective interaction potential is not new .",
    "in fact , the approximation is used in traditional plasma theory as well , albeit in an indirect manner .",
    "landau s seminal collision operator@xcite is based on a binary scattering picture where particles interact via their bare coulomb interaction . however , this neglects the effect of screening and leads to an unphysical divergence .",
    "the effective potential concept is tacitly applied when screening is imposed through setting the maximum impact parameter to be the debye length .",
    "the screened coulomb ( debye - hckel ) potential has also been applied , but this does not include correlation effects that are important at strong coupling.@xcite in addition to our previous work on fluid transport,@xcite recent computations of single particle stopping power have successfully included correlation effects using an effective potential concept.@xcite the bulk of previous theoretical approaches either focus on deriving collision operators based on new closures of the bbgky hierarchy,@xcite or calculate transport properties from higher - order equilibrium correlation functions.@xcite a popular approach to deriving new collision operators is to generalize the dielectric response function to include correlation physics through a local field correction . in this work ,",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we apply the standard boltzmann collision operator with the only modification being the interaction force . to include correlation effects in this force ,",

    "although we focus on classical hnc in this work , any other approximation for @xmath1 could also be applied .",
    "for example , pair correlation functions in dense plasmas also require accounting for the quantum nature of electrons.@xcite utilizing the equilibrium relationship between @xmath1 and the potential of mean force , the input to the theory becomes @xmath1 .    in practice , evaluating transport coefficients using the effective potential theory consists of three steps .",

    "we obtain a model for the effective potential using the hnc approximation ( sec . [",

    "second , this potential is used to calculate the input functions for the transport theory .",
