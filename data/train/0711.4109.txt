    ", high redshift qsos is that they are black holes fed by by major mergers of gas - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent incarnations of such models @xcite provide a good description of many observed properties of the qso population .",
    "the situation is particularly interesting at high redshift , where the population of supermassive black holes that powers the qsos is growing rapidly ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . to further understand this important phase of black hole and galaxy evolution we would like to build a model in which qso activity is tied to the evolving cosmic web of dark matter halos .",
    "the relationship between qsos and dark matter halos , their environments and duty cycles , can be constrained via observations of their space density and large - scale clustering @xcite .",
    "these constraints become particularly sensitive if the qsos inhabit the rarest , most massive halos for which the spatial clustering depends strongly on halo mass @xcite .    at redshifts @xmath4 the advent of large optical surveys for qsos",
    "has led to firm constraints on the clustering as a function of luminosity and redshift @xcite . with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "we are now able to measure the clustering of qsos well even at @xmath5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also earlier work by @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the correlation length of the qso population increases rapidly with redshift , from @xmath6 at @xmath7 to @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that they can fit the observed clustering and space density of @xmath0 qsos with the model of @xcite provided the @xmath0 qsos are relatively long lived ( @xmath10myr ) and inhabit halos more massive than about @xmath11 .",
    "for this calculation @xcite assume that there is a monotonic relationship between instantaneous qso luminosity and halo mass , with no scatter .",
    "the actual relation between instantaneous qso luminosity and host halo mass is expected to include some scatter .",
    "scatter is expected in several of the relationships linking the qso luminosity and the host halo mass : the relationship between the host halo mass and galaxy bulge , in the relationship between galaxy bulge and black hole mass , in the relationship between black hole mass and peak luminosity and in the relationship between peak and instantaneous qso luminosity .    here",
    "we demonstrate that the very high correlation length measured by @xcite , when combined with the rapid increase in bias for the most massive halos , strongly constrains the scatter between instantaneous qso luminosity and halo mass .",
    "the essential idea is that any scatter increases the contribution from lower mass ( and less highly biased ) halos , so that a measurement of large clustering amplitude limits the contribution from lower mass objects .",
    "this constraint is as strong as direct , observational constraints at lower redshift on the amount of scatter in the various relationships mentioned above .",
    "we shall work throughout in the @xmath12cdm framework and adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "where appropriate we shall comment on how our results depend on these particular choices .",
    "the next section outlines our formalism and applies it to the data of @xcite , while  [ sec : discussion ] interprets our results and discusses future observations .",
    "we will focus our attention on the space density and large - scale bias of qsos , as these are the easiest to interpret , observationally measurable properties of the population .",
    "if the mean number of qsos in a halo of mass @xmath17 is @xmath18 then their number density and large - scale bias are @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ( comoving ) number density of halos per mass interval and @xmath21 is the bias associated with halos of that mass . for @xmath20 we use the fitting function from @xcite .",
    "the large - scale bias is slightly more problematic , as our results depend upon massive halos being biased and different fits to @xmath21 from simulations have appeared in the literature . @xcite",
    "derived the bias appropriate to their mass function fit using the peak background split .",
    "a slightly higher bias at fixed mass comes from assuming ellipsoidal collapse @xcite .",
    "the largest bias for halos of a given mass is given by the bias of the @xcite mass function , as computed by @xcite , which is very similar to the fit of @xcite for the masses of interest .",
    "these two forms give biases 30% larger , in the mass and redshift range of interest , than the lowest fit ( of * ? ? ?",
    "the fit of @xcite lies between that of @xcite and @xcite . for mass - thresholded samples of dark matter halos in a large n - body simulation particles in a @xmath22gpc box using the _ treepm _ code described in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent comparison with other n - body codes .",
    "] , we found the @xcite and @xcite forms bracketed the halo correlation function so this should represent the level of current uncertainty . as it provides the most conservative estimate of the maximum allowed scatter , and the numerical data lay closer to the form of @xcite , we adopt this as our fiducial bias . however , we caution that the statistics in the simulation are poor and we also illustrate the effect of choosing the @xcite form below . in several recent simulations at other redshifts and masses",
    "the @xcite form appears to be a worse fit @xcite , but unfortunately there are few direct n - body calibrations of @xmath23 at the number densities and redshifts of interest to us .",
    "one could imagine that for extremely rare peaks , whose collapse is much closer to spherical @xcite , these newer fits actually perform worse than the original formulation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this challenging numerical problem deserves further investigation .    to interpret the large - scale clustering measurements of @xcite",
    "we then must specify @xmath18 .",
    "we wish to choose as simple a model as possible to illustrate the effect of scatter on the @xmath24 relation , so we assume that the probability that a qso is seen with instantaneous luminosity @xmath25 is log - normally distributed can be interpreted as a fractional scatter .",

    "if we assume that at most a fraction @xmath32 of halos host active qsos at any epoch and that @xmath33 in the region of the turn - on , the mean number of qsos above @xmath31 in halos of mass @xmath17 is @xmath34 \\label{eqn : nofm}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and we expect @xmath37 .",
    "we shall assume eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nofm ] ) in what follows and try to constrain @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ fig : b_vs_n ] shows @xmath38 vs.  @xmath39 for a range of @xmath40 and @xmath26 .",
    "the larger the dispersion the lower the bias at fixed space density , as a larger fraction of the qsos are hosted in lower mass halos .",
    "similarly , a decrease in @xmath32 must be compensated by a decrease in @xmath40 to hold @xmath41 fixed , again leading to a lower @xmath42 . in our assumed cosmology the universe is @xmath43gyr old at @xmath44 .",
    "if we assume @xmath45 ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ) then the e - folding time is @xmath46 , so @xmath47 is not unexpected . while the inferred lifetimes are then weakly in conflict with the upper range of observational constraints ( @xmath48 years ; *",
    "* ) , these constraints largely stem from lower - redshift qsos .",
    "our model is not the most general one describing how qsos inhabit dark matter halos . in particular",
    ", there is no reason in principle why halos could not host more than one qso . to constrain the functional form of @xmath18",
    "would require modeling both the large- and small - scale clustering , and additional assumptions about the statistics of qsos in halos .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper , so we merely note that the mass function is very steeply falling in the range of halo masses that are of interest .",
    "our statistics are thus dominated by the lowest mass halos in our sample .",
    "in particular , the number density is approximately linear in @xmath49 .",
    "simply allowing @xmath50 has no impact on @xmath51 , but it would raise @xmath41 and slightly weaken our constraints . however to increase @xmath41 significantly above that for @xmath52 would require almost every halo of mass @xmath40 to host more than one high luminosity qso which would lead to an unacceptably high close pair fraction .",
    "for example , if every halo hosted 2 qsos the volume averaged correlation function within the halo radius would be @xmath53 . given the extreme rarity of these halos , this would be in conflict with observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g.  fig .",
    "17 in @xcite ) .    at this point",
    "it is also easy to see how a change in cosmological parameters affects @xmath24 .",
    "for example , if we raise @xmath54 , halos of a fixed mass correspond to less rare peaks .",
    "these halos are therefore slightly less biased and significantly more numerous .",
    "to hold @xmath41 fixed we would need to increase @xmath40 . to hold the bias fixed requires that we increase @xmath40 yet further and therefore to match both the @xmath42 and @xmath41",
    "the duty cycle must increase . for @xmath55 ,",
    "a 10% increase in @xmath54 leads to a 4% decrease in @xmath42 , which is insignificant for our purposes . in general , for a power - law power spectrum with index @xmath56 , the fractional change in number density at fixed bias is @xmath57 times the fractional change in @xmath54 .",
    "small changes in the other cosmological parameters have even smaller effects .",
    "this formalism allows us to use the observations of high-@xmath58 qso clustering from @xcite to constrain @xmath26 and @xmath32 in our model . to do",
    "so we need to estimate the large - scale bias , @xmath42 , from the measurements provided in @xcite and this requires making several assumptions .",
    "first we must convert from the clustering quoted by @xcite to large - scale bias .",
    "there are several ways to do this , and we have chosen to use the amplitude of their fits to @xmath59 power - laws over the range @xmath60mpc . at lower @xmath58",
    "the bias is relatively constant over this range and the slope of the dark matter correlation function is close to @xmath61 , so converting the fit into a measurement of @xmath51 is straightforward .",
    "however at @xmath5 the qsos are hosted by increasingly rare halos , whose bias is becoming more scale dependent . using the mass and halo catalogs from the n - body simulation",
    "described previously we find that the mass correlation function is shallower than @xmath59 below @xmath62 but the halo correlation function is still quite close to @xmath59 down to @xmath63mpc .",
    "we therefore convert from @xmath64 to @xmath51 by matching @xmath65 at @xmath66mpc , where the bias is close to constant .",
    "( this is also the scale where we compared the simulations to the @xcite fitting form to obtain the bias . ) for convenience we use the non - linear power spectrum of @xcite when computing @xmath67 , but we checked that this agrees well with the results of the n - body simulation on the scales of interest and the correction for non - linearity is relatively small .",
    "the clustering measurements of @xcite are averaged over bins in redshift , over which the bias and mass correlations are evolving strongly .",
    "fortuitously , the effects approximately cancel , leading to a slow evolution in @xmath68 .",
    "we estimate the effects of clustering evolution on our constant - time constraints by considering 3 models for the evolution : passive evolution ( which for massive , rare halos corresponds almost to @xmath69constant ) , constant bias and constant halo mass .",
    "each model predicts @xmath70 from which we can compute the average value measured by @xcite as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the redshift distribution , @xmath73 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath58 and @xmath74 is the comoving angular diameter distance to redshift @xmath58 .",
    "using @xmath72 from table 1 of @xcite in the two bins @xmath75 and @xmath76 we find that for the passive evolution model the correlation length inferred from @xmath77 is within 1% of that inferred from @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "for the constant halo mass case @xmath80 increases with @xmath58 , but the inferred @xmath64 is still within 5% of the constant @xmath58 value for both samples .",
    "for the constant bias case , @xmath80 decreases with @xmath58 , but the inferred @xmath64 is within 4% of the constant @xmath58 value for both samples . since the quoted errors on @xmath64 are larger than this , we shall interpret the quoted correlation lengths as measurements at @xmath81 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath82 , @xcite quote @xmath83mpc for their `` good '' sample with @xmath75 . using the dark matter correlation function for our cosmology at @xmath81",
    "this corresponds to @xmath84 .",
    "the quoted space density is @xmath85 .",
    "if we use the ` all ' sample both @xmath64 and hence @xmath51 are 14% lower .",
    "we will find that this point is relatively unconstraining for either choice .    at @xmath44",
    "the best fit is @xmath86mpc , again using the `` good '' sample , corresponding to @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the other clustering fits provided by @xcite are discussed below .",
    "note however , as pointed out by @xcite , this space density is actually an underestimate of the true space density because the @xcite parameterization of the lf underestimates the measured space density from @xmath89 ( see figure 20 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath9",
    "this underestimate is approximately a factor of two and we therefore use @xmath90 .",
    "the higher space density leads to a smaller predicted @xmath51 , requiring smaller dispersion @xmath26 between luminosity and halo mass to fit the observed clustering ( i.e.  this provides a more stringent constraint ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_vs_sig ] we show @xmath38 as a function of log - normal scatter , @xmath26 , at fixed @xmath41 for @xmath52 , 0.3 and 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath91 and @xmath92 confidence ranges in @xmath42 ( above ) are also shown .",
    "as can be seen , in order to get the large @xmath42 seen by @xcite , the scatter at @xmath9 has to be less than 80% and the fraction of halos containing quasars , @xmath32 , must be larger than @xmath93 .",
    "the constraints will change if different fits to the clustering measurements , different fits for @xmath94 , or different number densities are used .",
    "as the constraints are coming from @xmath44 , we focus on this case .",
    "@xcite gives 4 fits to power - law correlation functions , for `` all '' or `` good '' qso s , with fixed power law @xmath95 or varying power law .",
    "the fiducial calculation above was for the `` good '' qsos sample fit to @xmath95 , which has a @xmath96 .",
    "the other combinations give : ( sample , power - law index , @xmath97 , @xmath98)= ( `` all '' , @xmath99 , 0.52 , -15% ) , ( `` good '' , @xmath100 , 0.32 , + 6% ) , ( `` all '' , @xmath101 , 0.50 , -6% )",
    ". the central value in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_vs_sig ] then just moves up and down by the shift in bias ( the error bars do change slightly in width ) .",
    "our example in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_vs_sig ] is one of the best @xmath97 cases but also gives a high bias ( and thus is very constraining ) .",
    "as mentioned previously , our fiducial @xmath94 was chosen to give the least stringent constraint .",
    "the functional forms of @xcite , and @xcite predict lower @xmath94 at fixed @xmath17 and hence tighter constraints on @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "we illustrate the range in figure [ fig : bias_cmp ] , which compares the results using our fiducial bias to that of @xcite . as we discussed before the fits to @xmath21 from n - body simulations , where they are available , tend to lie between those of @xcite and @xcite which differ from each other by @xmath102 in the mass and redshift range of interest ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "neither the sheth - tormen or sheth - mo - tormen biases are able to fit the measured bias and number density .",
    "the most unconstraining estimate would be to use the lower amplitude of clustering , e.g.  the `` all '' sample , at @xmath44 .",
    "we did not choose this because there are a number of systematics which could lower the measured clustering amplitude and the `` all '' sample has a worse @xmath97 .",
    "but if taken in conjunction with the ( most conservative ) press - schechter bias and the highest allowed number density , the limit can be weakened to allow @xmath103 at 95% confidence for @xmath104 .",
    "it is also possible that qsos may inhabit a special subclass of halos for which the bias is larger than the average for that mass .",
    "for instance there are indications that halo history affects clustering in some cases @xcite . for the very rare and highly biased halos hosting qsos at @xmath9",
    "this effect may be large enough to weaken our constraint .",
    "unfortunately the bias of the relevant objects has not yet been measured in simulations .",
    "it appears that the most luminous , highest redshift qsos have instantaneous luminosities which are well correlated with their host halo masses . the already strong constraint shown here",
    "should be improved by measurements of high - redshift qso clustering with yet larger samples .",
    "new observations will broadly improve the constraint in two ways : through wider area observations to identify a larger number of qsos similar in redshift to the sdss sample , and through deeper observations over the same area .",
    "deeper observations will identify slightly fainter qsos at all redshifts and may provide a sufficient sample to measure the clustering amplitude at even higher redshift than @xmath105 , where we expect the bias to be even larger . going wider in area will decrease the fractional error on @xmath42 for high - redshift qsos .",
    "as these measurements of high - redshift qso bias will remain poisson limited , the fractional error on @xmath42 will scale as @xmath106 for a survey of @xmath107 qsos .",
    "going deeper to measure luminous qsos at yet higher redshifts is also expected to be useful , as the data indicate strong evolution in the clustering amplitude with redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : b_vs_z ] illustrates how @xmath42 increases with redshift for three values of the scatter between qso luminosity and host halo mass assuming @xmath108 . at each redshift @xmath42 was calculated to match the qso space density evolution parametrized by @xcite , although converted to our cosmological parameters and consequently the predicted bias is slightly higher . ] .",
    "the steepest relation between @xmath42 and redshift is for the case of the smallest scatter . if @xmath108 and the scatter is minimal , the relative value of @xmath42 for different values of the dispersion is a good measure of the fractional uncertainty in @xmath42 required to improve on our constraint .",
    "these ratios demonstrate that the most effective constraint from clustering arises from the lowest redshift at which @xmath108 and minimal scatter is a reasonable approximation .",
    "for example , the ratio of @xmath109 to @xmath110 increases by less than 10% from @xmath44 to @xmath111 , while the @xmath107 above the sdss flux limit drops by approximately an order of magnitude . therefore while the clustering amplitude increases , the decline in @xmath107 for a flux - limited , high - redshift survey more than offsets this gain .",
    "by contrast , color selection of just very high - redshift ( e.g.  @xmath112 ) qsos could produce a substantial improvement for a given total number of spectra .",
    "the immediate prospect for improvement in this constraint is completion of the sdss observations beyond the 4000 square degrees employed by @xcite .",
    "these observations will simply increase @xmath107 and the error bars should scale as @xmath113 . on a somewhat longer timescale , the proposed baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) should approximately double the number of @xmath76 qsos , although it will mostly achieve this by going deeper .",
    "provided @xmath108 and small scatter are still reasonable approximations to this slightly fainter population ( that will still be well above the break in the qso lf ) , boss factor of two improvement in sample size should decrease the error bars by approximately a factor of two and produce a powerful improvement in the constraint .",
    "for example , if the measured bias stayed fixed and the errorbars decreased by a factor of two , the upper limit on the observed scatter would improve to less than 0.5 ( i.e.  0.2 dex ) for @xmath114 .",
    "there are also upcoming photometric surveys that go even wider in area and deeper : pan - starrs , the dark energy survey ( des ) , and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",
    "while these surveys do not include a dedicated plan for spectroscopic observations of qsos , they will provide the necessary candidate database of these extremely rare objects for spectroscopy .    on the theoretical side , the calculations presented here could also be improved .",
    "better modeling could allow us to use a wider range of scales .",
    "as large - scale , high - resolution simulations become increasingly feasible , it will become possible to precisely measure both the bias of all halos and the bias as a function of halo history .",
    "the scatter between these various relationships can also be measured in self - consistent numerical simulations of merger - driven black hole growth .",
    "@xcite presented a recent analysis of the observed and simulated scatter between black hole mass and various host ( bulge ) galaxy properties ( @xmath26 , host galaxy mass , effective radius ) at lower redshifts than we are considering here .",
    "they find that the intrinsic scatter is generally lower than the observed ( upper limit ) and as small as @xmath115dex for combinations that produce a fundamental plane for black holes .",
    "however , they also note that the strong correlation of black hole mass with bulge properties implies that the connection to halo mass is only indirect and dominated by the evolution in the typical gas fractions .",
    "measurement of the evolution of these quantities in full cosmological simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could provide measurements of the expected scatter at the very high redshifts where qsos are observed to be so strongly biased .",
    "regardless of these future prospects , the strength of the present constraint on scatter in a monotonic relation between qso luminosity and halo mass is already surprising .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we expect scatter to be present because we expect scatter in at least four relationships that combine to determine the instantaneous luminosity of a qso in a halo of a given mass : the relationship between instantaneous luminosity and peak luminosity ; the relationship between peak luminosity and black hole mass ; the relationship between black hole mass and bulge properties ; and the relationship between bulge and halo mass .",
    "these expectations arise from the observed scatter in these individual relations at lower redshifts  intriguingly , in all cases the observed scatter only sets an upper limit on the intrinsic scatter .    for the relation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion known as the @xmath116 relation @xcite , @xcite showed that the intrinsic dispersion is no larger than 0.250.3 dex ( or @xmath117 in our natural log notation ) .",
    "@xcite explored the relation between @xmath118 by using rotation curve data and argued that the dispersion between black hole and halo mass could be even less than the @xmath3 dispersion , although she notes that the uncertainty in the transformation between circular velocity and halo mass is not well characterized .",
    "finally , @xcite measured the distribution in eddington ratio , @xmath119 , for a sample of @xmath120 qsos and find the distribution is well described as log - normal with a peak at 0.25 and a dispersion of 0.3 dex .",
    "as this observed dispersion must account for the uncertainty in the mass estimator and bolometric correction in addition to @xmath119 , this measurement also sets an upper limit to the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath119 .",
    "in addition to the small scatter in @xmath121 , the data also suggest that the duty cycle is approximately unity",
    ". this may be less surprising , given their extremely high luminosities and masses of their supermassive black holes .",
    "if qsos are limited to accreting at no more than the eddington rate , the luminosities of @xmath122 qsos imply that their central , supermassive black holes already exceeded @xmath123 when the universe was less than @xmath124gyr old @xcite .",
    "subsequent near - infrared spectroscopy provides further evidence that their central black holes are indeed this massive @xcite . to create such massive black holes at early times",
    "requires @xmath125 , modulo the uncertainty in the initial seed mass .",
    "together , these strong constraints on the duty cycle and scatter in @xmath126 for high - redshift qsos provide important new information on how supermassive black holes and their host halos grew at early times .",
