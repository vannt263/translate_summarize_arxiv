    "the nizhnik - novikov - veselov ( nnv ) equation @xcite is an important 2 + 1 dimensional integrable equation which is a natural generalization of the kdv equation to 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it is useful in both mechanics and differential geometry @xcite .",
    "the nnv equation has been solved by various methods such as inverse scattering @xcite , bilinear method @xcite , bilinear bcklund transformation @xcite , binary darboux transformation @xcite and so on @xcite .",
    "however , one can not construct the usual darboux transformation ( without integration ) because the principal part of the first equation of its lax pair is two dimensional wave operator or laplace operator .",
    "starting from the idea of nonlinearization @xcite , many high dimensional integrable systems were reduced to lower dimensional ones so that interesting solutions like soliton solutions and quasi - periodic solutions can be obtained from lower dimensional systems .",
    "especially , the kp equation @xcite , the equation and the @xmath2 dimensional @xmath3-wave equation @xcite were related to some 1 + 1 dimensional akns systems .",
    "following this idea , in this paper , we present a lax system of three variables , two equations of which form the lax pair of the stationary davey - stewartson  i-1pt i ( ds i-1pt i ) equation . with the nonlinear constraints ( [ eq : nonl_constr ] )",
    ", the full integrability condition of this lax system contains the hyperbolic nnv equation and its standard lax pair .",
    "the equation has a darboux transformation without integration . with the relations given by ( [ eq : nonl_constr ] ) , the darboux transformation for equation is used to solve the hyperbolic nnv equation .",
    "this darboux transformation without integration is more suitable for symbolic calculation than the known binary darboux transformation .",
    "it is well known that equation has solutions approaching zero exponentially at spatial infinity , but equation has not .",
    "however , we get soliton solution @xmath4 of the hyperbolic nnv equation from that of the stationary equation so that @xmath4 approaches zero exponentially at spatial infinity .",
    "this is possible because the solution @xmath4 of the hyperbolic nnv equation is given by @xmath5 as in ( [ eq : nonl_constr ] ) , not @xmath6 , the solution of the stationary equation .",
    "these soliton solutions are different from the known one derived by binary darboux transformation or bilinear method etc . and the behavior of the solutions is more complicated .",
    "in section  [ sect : nnv_ds ] , after reviewing the hyperbolic nnv equation and the stationary equation together with their standard lax pairs , a new lax system ( [ eq : lp ] ) is presented in which an extra equation is added to the standard lax pair of the stationary equation . with the nonlinear constraints ( [ eq : nonl_constr ] ) , the integrability condition of this lax system includes both the hyperbolic nnv equation and its standard lax pair .",
    "the darboux transformation for the new lax system is given in section  [ sect : dt ] and the general expression of multi - soliton solutions is presented in section  [ sect : stn ] . in section  [ sect:1stn ] , the explicit expressions and behavior of single - soliton solutions",
    "are discussed . in section  [",
    "sect : nstn ] , it is proved that each @xmath0-soliton solution approaches zero uniformly and exponentially at spatial infinity . in section  [",
    "sect : tinfty ] , it is proved that each @xmath0-soliton solution is asymptotic to @xmath1 lumps of peaks at temporal infinity .",
    "finally , some linear algebraic lemmas are presented in the appendix .",
    "the hyperbolic nnv equation is @xmath7 which has a lax pair @xmath8    by taking the new coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the hyperbolic nnv equation ( [ eq : nnv ] ) becomes @xmath11 and the lax pair ( [ eq : lp_nnv ] ) becomes @xmath12    on the other hand , the equation is @xmath13 which has a lax pair @xmath14 where @xmath15    if @xmath16 is independent of @xmath17 , ( [ eq : ds ] ) becomes the stationary equation @xmath18 taking @xmath19 in ( [ eq : lp_ds ] ) , we get the lax pair for ( [ eq : sds ] ) as @xmath20    the first equation of ( [ eq : lp_nnv2 ] ) and the first equation of ( [ eq : sds ] ) are similar , and the second equation of ( [ eq : lp_nnv2 ] ) is of order @xmath21 .",
    "hence we introduce an extra equation to the lax pair ( [ eq : lp_sds ] ) so that the whole system becomes @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are given by ( [ eq : jpq ] ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 refer to differential operators with respect to @xmath30 whose coefficients are @xmath31 matrices , @xmath32 .",
    "the integrability conditions of ( [ eq : lp ] ) include the following equations : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35    note that ( [ eq : lp_nnvb ] ) is exactly the same as the original lax pair ( [ eq : lp_nnv2 ] ) of the hyperbolic nnv equation . by direct calculation",
    ", we know that @xmath36 satisfies the hyperbolic nnv equation ( [ eq : nnv2 ] ) provided that @xmath6 and @xmath37 satisfy ( [ eq : lp_nnvb])([eq : nonl_constr ] ) . therefore , explicit solutions of the hyperbolic nnv equation can be obtained from those of ( [ eq : lp_nnvb])([eq : nonl_constr ] ) .",
    "clearly , the solutions of ( [ eq : lp_nnvb])([eq : nonl_constr ] ) are only part of those of the hyperbolic nnv equation .",
    "however , they include some interesting ones which will be shown in the rest of this paper .",
    "the binary darboux transformation for the hyperbolic nnv equation is well - known @xcite .",
    "integrations are needed in constructing explicit solutions . however , for equation , usual darboux transformation without integration is known .",
    "this darboux transformation is simpler than the binary darboux transformation for the hyperbolic nnv equation , and can be easily used to the stationary equation so that explicit solutions of the hyperbolic nnv equation can be constructed .",
    "note that the coefficients of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 satisfy @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "that is , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 satisfy @xmath41 hence , if @xmath42 is a solution of ( [ eq : lp ] ) with @xmath43 , then @xmath44 is a solution of ( [ eq : lp ] ) with @xmath45 .",
    "the darboux transformation of arbitrary order is constructed as follows @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath46 is a darboux operator for ( [ eq : lp ] ) , i.e. , there exist @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 which have the same form as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath6 and @xmath37 replaced by certain @xmath50 and @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 if so , @xmath54 satisfies @xmath55 since @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 satisfy the relations ( [ eq : reduc_lmn ] ) , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 satisfy the similar relations @xmath56 we want that @xmath54 satisfies @xmath57 .",

    "let @xmath69 be a column solution of ( [ eq : lp ] ) with @xmath70 , then @xmath71 is a solution of ( [ eq : lp ] ) with @xmath72 @xmath73 .",

    "for zero seed solution @xmath80 , ( [ eq : lp ] ) becomes @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
