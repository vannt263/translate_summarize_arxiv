    "the concept of `` balance '' , either global or local in any given context , it is undoubtedly the cornerstone in the increasing number of environmental problems . the question is : why are the environmental problems in the focus now ?",
    "one particular answer can be found in a hierarchy of the main scientific problems in this century . according to the physicists , the world scientific community ,",
    "will be occupied in this century among others , by the environmental problems that are primarily expressed through the problem of climate changes [ 1 , 2 ] as well as many other linked problems that comprises a wide range of time and spatial scales .",
    "this is the first time in the history of science that the environmental problems take the place at the research front of the sciences .",
    "the question , why it is happening now and why it will go on happening in the future , could be answered by the well known fact that in the scientific as well as in other worlds the main `` dramatic event '' takes place at the interface between either two media or two states [ 3 ] .",
    "the field of environmental sciences is abundant with various interfaces and it is the right place for application of new fundamental approaches leading towards better understanding of environmental phenomena .",
    "we define the environmental interface as an interface between the two , either abiotic or biotic environments each , which are in a relative motion exchanging energy through biophysical and chemical processes and fluctuating temporally and spatially regardless of its space and time scale . in our opinion , this definition broadly covers the unavoidable multidisciplinary approach in environmental sciences and also includes the traditional approaches in sciences that are dealing with the environmental space less complex than any one met in reality .",
    "the wealth and complexity of processes at this interface determine that the scientists , as it often seems , are more interested in a possibility of non - linear `` dislocations '' and surprises in the behaviour of the environment than in a smooth extrapolation of current trends and a use of the approaches close to the linear physics [ 3 - 6 ] . to overcome the current situation we have to do the following : ( a ) establish a way in approaching the non - linear physics and the non - linearity in describing the phenomena in physics as well as environmental sciences , and ( b ) solve or , at least , understand the problem of predictability .",
    "these two problems are problems par excellence of the methodology .",
    "their successful solving will help us avoid the current problems in mathematical , physical , biological and chemical interpretation of the nature .",
    "in the next section , we write down the equation for the energy balance at the environmental interface .",
    "we show that under certain conditions , its discrete version becomes well - known logistic equation leading to the chaotic behaviour of the temperature .",
    "the conditions for such behaviour are investigated and particular examples studied .",
    "the analysis is based on the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we see the outside world , i.e. the world of phenomena ( _ ambience _ ) from the observer s perspective ( its inner world ) . in the ambience",
    "there are _ systems _ of different levels of complexity and their environments .",
    "system in the ambience is a collection of precepts while whatever lies outside , like the component of a set , constitutes the environment [ 7,8 ] .",
    "the `` fate '' of science lies in the fact that it is focused on the system [ 8 ] .",
    "furthermore , to be able to anticipate something , we describe the system by the states ( determined by observations ) while the environment is characterized through its effects on the system . the environmental interface as a complex system is a suitable area for occurrence of the irregularities in temporal variation of some physical or biological quantities describing their interaction . for example , such interface can be placed between : human or animal bodies and surrounding air , aquatic species and water and air around them , natural or artificially built surfaces ( vegetation , ice , snow , barren soil , water , urban communities ) and atmosphere [ 4 - 6,9,10 ] , etc . the environmental interface of different media was recently considered for different purposes [ 3 - 6 , 11 - 13 ] . in these systems",
    "visible radiation provides almost all of the energy received on the environmental interface .",
    "some of the radiant energy is reflected back to space .",
    "the interface also radiates , in the thermal waveband , some of the energy received from the sun .",
    "the quantity of the radiant energy remaining on the environmental interface is the net radiation ( the net radiation energy available on the surface when all inward and outward streams of radiation have been considered as seen in fig . 1 where all kinds of energy are expressed in terms of the flux density ) , which drives certain physical processes important to us . the energy balance equation may be written as    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the environmental interface soil heat capacity per unit area , @xmath2 is the environmental interface temperature ( ei ) , @xmath3 is the time,@xmath4 and @xmath5 are the sensible and the latent heat , respectively , transferred by convection , and @xmath6 the heat transferred by conduction into deeper layers of underlying matter . +",

    "this is a non - linear riccati type differential equation that practically always has to be solved numerically , i.e. , @xmath25 ( 3 ) where @xmath26 is the finite difference operator defined as @xmath27 , @xmath28 the time level , @xmath29 is the time step and @xmath30 is the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) defined at the @xmath28th time level .",
    "we consider eq . ( 2.2 ) with the lower boundary condition , at some time interval , given in the form @xmath31 expressing slow temperature changes in both the environment and underlying material . then equation becomes    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "substituting the time derivative by the finite difference operator @xmath26 in this equation and after some transformations , we obtain    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this equation has the same form as the well known logistic difference equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant ( see , e.g. [ 17 ] , among others ) .",
    "conditions for occurrence of deterministic chaos for logistic mapping given by this equation are : ( a)@xmath40 and ( b)@xmath41 . here we have to bear in mind that @xmath42 depends on discrete `` time '' @xmath28 . however , chaos is still expected , although we can give no quantitative prediction of the parameter regime .",
    "we analyze eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) in the following way . with @xmath43",
    "we indicate the scaling time range of energy exchange at the environmental interface including coefficients , that express all kind of energy reaching and departing the environmental interface . for any chosen time interval , for solving eq .",

    "we get the interval ( @xmath48 ) where the solution is chaotic , i.e.,@xmath49 .",
    "we analyze now the occurrence of the chaos in solution of eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) . since conditions ( a ) and ( b ) are necessary but not sufficient for identification of the chaos",

    "we solve eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) for different values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , varying them in a broad range of energy exchange coefficients .",

    "+ now , we give a specific example of the above analysis applied to the interface of the earth and its environment .",
    "it is now accepted that the earth is a complex system which consists of the biota and their environment .",
    "these two elements of the system are closely coupled : the biota regulate the environment ( e.g. , climate on planetary scale ) and , in turn , the environment restricts the evolution of the biota and dictates what type of life can exist .",
    "changes in one part will influence the other , being opposed by negative feedback or enhanced by positive feedback , and this may lead to oscillation or chaos in the system . in the system",

    "the main aim of the report was to indicate the possibility of chaotic behaviour of the temperature at the interface of two media where the energy is exchanged by all three known mechanisms .",
    "the conditions for such phenomenon are discussed .",
