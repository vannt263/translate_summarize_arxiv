    "due to the exploding popularity of all things wireless , the demand for wireless data traffic increases dramatically . according to a cisco report",
    ", global mobile data traffic will increase 13-fold between 2012 and 2017 @xcite .",
    "this dramatic demand puts on pressure on mobile network operators ( mnos ) to purchase more spectrum .",
    "however , wireless spectrum is a scarce resource for mobile services . even if the continued innovations in technological progress relax this constraint as it provides more capacity and higher quality of service ( qos ) , the shortage of spectrum is still the bottleneck when the mobile telecommunications industry is moving toward wireless broadband services @xcite .    to achieve a dominant position for future wireless services , thus",
    ", it is significant how new spectrum is allocated to mnos .",
    "since the spectrum is statically and infrequently allocated to an mno , there has been an ongoing fight over access to the spectrum . in south korea , for example , the korea communications commission ( kcc ) planed to auction off additional spectrum in both 1.8 ghz and 2.6 ghz bands .",
    "the main issue was whether korea telecom ( kt ) acquires the contiguous spectrum block or not .",
    "due to the kt s existing holding downlink 10 mhz in the 1.8 ghz band , it could immediately double the existing long term evolution ( lte ) network capacity in the 1.8 ghz band at little or no cost .",
    "this is due to the support of the downlink up to 20 mhz contiguous bandwidth by lte release 8/9 . to the user side",
    ", there is no need for upgrading their handsets .",
    "lte release 10 ( lte - a ) can support up to 100 mhz bandwidth but this requires the carrier aggregation ( ca ) technique , for which both infrastructure and handsets should be upgraded . if kt leases the spectrum block in the 1.8 ghz band , kt might achieve a dominant position in the market . on the other hand , other mnos expect to make heavy investments as well as some deployment time to double their existing lte network capacities compared to kt @xcite .",
    "thus , the other mnos requested the government to exclude kt from bidding on the contiguous spectrum block to ensure market competitiveness .",
    "although we consider the example of south korea , this interesting but challenging issue on spectrum allocation is not limited to south korea but to most countries when asymmetric - valued spectrum blocks are auctioned off to mnos .",
    "spectrum auctions are widely used by governments to allocate spectrum for wireless communications .",
    "most of the existing auction literatures assume that each bidder ( i.e. , an mno ) only cares about his own profit : what spectrum block he gets and how much he has to pay @xcite . given spectrum constraints , however , there is some evidence that a bidder considers not only to maximize his own profit in the event that he wins the auction but to minimize the weighted difference of his competitor s profit and his own profit in the event that he loses the auction @xcite .",
    "this strategic concern can be interpreted as a _",
    "spite motive _ , which is the preference to make competitors worse off .",
    "since it might increase the mno s relative position in the market , such concern has been observed in spectrum auctions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study bidding and pricing competition between two competing / spiteful mnos with considering their existing spectrum holdings . given",
    "that asymmetric - valued spectrum blocks are auctioned off to them , we developed an analytical framework to investigate the interactions between two mnos and users as a three - stage dynamic game .",
    "in tage i , two spiteful mnos compete in a first - price sealed - bid auction .",
    "departing from the standard auction framework , we address the bidding behavior of the spiteful mno . in tage ii , two competing mnos optimally set their service prices to maximize their revenues with the newly allocated spectrum . in tage iii , users decide whether to stay in their current mno or to switch to the other mno for utility maximization .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    * _ asymmetric pricing structure _ :",
    "we show that two mnos announce different equilibrium prices to the users , even providing the same quality in services to the users . * _ different market share _ : we show that the market share leader , despite charging a higher price , still achieve more market share .",
    "* _ impact of competition _ : we show that the competition between two mnos leads to some loss of their revenues . * _ cross - over point between two mno s profits _ : we show that two mnos profits are switched .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : related works are discussed in ection ii . the system model and three - stage dynamic game",
    "are described in ection iii . using backward induction",
    ", we analyze user responses and pricing competition in ections vi and v , and bidding competition in ection vi .",
    "we conclude in section ii together with some future research directions .",
    "in wireless communications , the competition among mnos have been addressed by many researchers @xcite@xcite .",
    "yu and kim @xcite studied price dynamics among mnos .",
    "they also suggested a simple regulation that guarantees a pareto optimal equilibrium point to avoid instability and inefficiency .",
    "niyato and hossain @xcite proposed a pricing model among mnos providing different services to users .",
    "however , these works did not consider the spectrum allocation issue .",
    "more closely related to our paper are some recent works @xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite studied bandwidth and price competition ( i.e. , bertrand competition ) among mnos . by taking into account mnos heterogeneity in leasing costs and users heterogeneity in transmission power and channel conditions , duan _",
    "et al_. presented a comprehensive analytical study of mnos spectrum leasing and pricing strategies in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a new allocation scheme is suggested by jointly considering mnos revenues and social welfare .",
    "x. feng _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested a truthful double auction scheme for heterogeneous spectrum allocation .",
    "none of the prior results considered mnos existing spectrum holdings even if the value of spectrum could be varied depending on mnos existing spectrum holdings .",
    "we consider two mnos ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) compete in a first - price sealed - bid auction , where two spectrum blocks @xmath2 and @xmath3 are auctioned off to them as shown in ig .",

    "we consider only the downlink throughput the paper .",
    "note that both mnos operate frequency division duplex lte ( fdd lte ) in the same area .    due to the mnos existing spectrum holdings ( i.e. , each mno secures 10 mhz downlink spectrum in the 1.8 ghz band ) ,",

    "to predict the effect of spectrum allocation , we solve this three - stage dynamic game by applying the concept of backward induction , from tage iii to tage i.",
    "each user subscribes to one of the mnos based on his or her mno preference .",
    "let us assume that mnos @xmath4 and @xmath5 provide same quality in services to the users so they have the same reserve utility @xmath10 before spectrum auction .",
    "each mno initially has 50% market share and the total user population is normalized to 1 .    in asymmetric phase ,",
    "the users in mnos @xmath4 and @xmath5 obtain different utilities , i.e. , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a user sensitivity parameter to the double - speed lte service than existing one .",
    "it means that users care more about the data rate as @xmath13 increases .",
    "the users in mno @xmath5 have more incentive to switch to mno @xmath4 as @xmath13 increases . when they decide to change mno @xmath4 , however , they face switching costs , the disutility that a user experiences from switching mnos . in the case of higher switching costs ,",
    "the users in mno @xmath5 have less incentive to switch .",
    "the switching cost varies among users and discounts over time . to model such users time - dependent heterogeneity ,",
    "we assume that the switching cost is heterogeneous across users and uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath14 $ ] at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the discount rate @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pays for the penalty of terminating contract with operators decrease as time passes .",
    "now let us focus on how users churn in asymmetric phase .",
    "a user @xmath17 in mno @xmath5 , with switching cost , @xmath18 , observes the prices charged by mnos @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",

    "an interesting observation is that both mnos decrease their service prices as @xmath40 increases . due to the discount factor ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "the users in mno @xmath5 are not locked - in and tries to maximize their utilities by churning to mno @xmath4 as switching costs decrease over time .",
    "therefore , mno @xmath4 lowers his service price to maximize his revenue , which forces mno @xmath5 to decrease the service price .",
    "this phenomenon is consistent with the previous results @xcite , @xcite in that the reduction of switching costs intensifies the price - down competition between two mnos .",
    "if @xmath41 , then all users in mno @xmath5 churn to mno @xmath4 . however , it is an unrealistic feature of the mobile telecommunication industry so we add the constraint @xmath42 .",

    "since mno @xmath5 launches double - speed lte service in symmetric phase , we assume that the users in mnos @xmath4 and @xmath5 obtain same utility , i.e. , @xmath46    for better understanding of user responses in symmetric phase , we first discuss the effect of switching costs on market competition . given the same services offered by two mnos , an mno s current market share plays an important role in determining its price strategy .",
    "each mno faces a trade - off between a low price to increase market share , and a high price to harvest profits by exploiting users switching costs .",
