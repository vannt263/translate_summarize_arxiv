    "narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , a class of active galactic nuclei  ( agns ) , are defined as having the following optical properties : ( 1 )  the full - width at half - maximum  ( fwhm ) of h@xmath1 is less than 2000  km  s@xmath2 , ( 2 )  permitted lines are only slightly broader than forbidden lines , and ( 3 )  [ oiii]/h@xmath33 .",
    "nls1s have been extensively studied on both optical and x - ray bands ; results show that many of their properties are clearly different to those of the classical seyfert galaxies .",
    "there is increasing evidence that nls1s are extreme agns , with accretion rates near the eddington limit ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) onto relatively lower mass ( @xmath4 ) black holes , although this picture is still under debate . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio properties of nls1s have not been well investigated ; to date , there are only two known systematic surveys @xcite . from these two surveys , unlike the optical and x - ray studies , the radio data showed little difference between nls1s and classical seyfert galaxies .",
    "suggested that there is a scarcity of radio - loud nls1s , particularly very radio - loud ones ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "radio loudness , @xmath5 , was conventionally defined as the ratio of 5-ghz radio to _ b_-band flux densities , with a threshold of @xmath6 separating radio - loud and radio - quiet objects ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for the scarcity of radio - loud ( @xmath7 ) nls1s is still unknown .",
    "the radio - quietness of nls1s may possibly be related to the suppression of radio jets emanated from accretion disks with high accretion rates @xcite , as well as x - ray binaries in the _ high / soft _ state ( see , e.g. ,   for a review ) .",
    "radio - loud ( @xmath7 ) nls1s are rare , but they do exist @xcite .",
    "one possible idea that could explain the existence of radio - loud nls1s is that nonthermal jets are associated with nls1s , and a relativistic effect on these jets influences the radio loudness of nls1s , as well as the other radio - loud agn classes .",
    "hardening of x - ray spectra during rapid x - ray flares of the radio - loud nls1 pks  0558@xmath8504 could arise from the transient spectral dominance of synchrotron emission from relativistically boosted jets @xcite , similar to the spectra of radio - loud quasars  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "observational evidence for the existence of nonthermal jets and doppler beaming effect on them are required .",
    "if not , the presence of bright radio lobes or a starburst will be needed to explain the radio excess .",
    "very long baseline interferometry  ( vlbi ) is the most powerful tool available for revealing to such properties by direct imaging .",
    "arcsecond - resolution observations have resolved the structures of only a few nls1s @xcite ; however , there was insufficient evidence to prove the existence of jets .",
    "vlbi images at milli - arcsecond  ( mas ) resolutions had been reported for only three radio - quiet nls1s : mrk  766 , akn  564 @xcite , and ngc  5506 @xcite ; pc - scale radio structures were revealed in these nls1s .",
    "vlbi observations on a large number of nls1s , both radio - quiet and radio - loud objects , are crucial if we are to understand the nature of possible highly energetic jet phenomena in these central engines .",
    "we have started vlbi imaging studies on over a dozen nls1s , including both radio - quiet and radio - loud objects .",
    "it has previously been reported that vlbi observations for the most radio - loud ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) object , sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 , revealed that doppler - boosted jets are needed to explain observed high brightness temperatures on its radio emissions @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we report our vlbi survey of five radio - loud nls1s at 8.4  ghz . in section  [ section :",

    "we selected five targets out of the nine radio - loud nls1s that were previously identified by from 205 nls1s listed in `` a catalogue of quasars and active nuclei : 10th ed . . ''",
    "the reason for the choice is that we could retrieve the national radio astronomy observatory s  ( nrao s ) vla archival data , obtained at 4.9 or 8.4  ghz with a - array configuration , which provide radio positions with sufficient accuracy for processing in a vlbi correlator .",
    "our sample of the five radio - loud nls1s is listed in table  [ table : sample ] .",

    "( 7 )  brightness temperature at the rest frame [ eq .  ( [ equation : brightnesstemperature ] ) ] .",
    "all sources were unresolved in the jvn beams , resulting in brightness temperatures higher than @xmath13@xmath14  k at the rest frame  ( table  [ table : result ] ) , which were calculated using @xmath15 in k , where @xmath16 is redshift , @xmath17 is the flux density in mjy at frequency @xmath18 in ghz , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in mas are the fitted full widths at half maximum of the major and minor axes of source size , respectively ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "because these were unresolved , we adopted one - half the beam sizes , i.e. , @xmath21 ( table  [ table : imageparameter ] ) , as the upper limits to the source sizes @xmath22 .",
    "the 8.4  ghz jvn flux densities for the two most radio - loud objects in our sample , rxs  j16290 + 4007 and rxs  j16446 + 2619 , were larger than 1.4  ghz vla ones  ( tables  [ table : sample ] and  [ table : result ] ) .",
    "although the difference between the beam sizes of vla and jvn causes resolution effect , we can obtain at least the lower limit of spectral index @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "hence , the two inverted ( @xmath25 ) spectra must be real , without any regard for possible flux variability .",
    "we discuss the origin of the detected radio flux densities and what makes these nls1s radio - loud , in the present paper .",
    "possible radio emitting sources with relatively high brightness temperatures in active galaxies are ( 1 )  an accretion disk , ( 2 )  circumnuclear ionized torus , ( 3 )  compact super - nova remnants  ( snrs ) , and ( 4 )  agn jets",
    ".    an effective temperature in accretion disk would be at most @xmath0  k even in the innermost region ( within several times the schwarzschild radius ) of a `` slim disk , '' a theoretical model for super - eddington accretion @xcite , which may be a possible central engine for nls1s ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the emissions from such a small region and a relatively low temperature could hardly account for the detected radio fluxes with jvn .",
    "the nucleus of the classical seyfert galaxy , ngc  1068 , has a component , s1 , that may trace thermal free - free emissions from the ionized region of innermost ( @xmath261  pc ) molecular torus @xcite .",
    "however , this is an exceptional example and its brightness temperature was at most @xmath27  k , far inferior when compared with the detected radio - loud nls1s .",
    "the measured brightness temperatures , @xmath28@xmath14  k  ( table  [ table : result ] ) , were quite high , which is evidence for the existence of a nonthermal process .",
    "many vlbi detections have been reported for very young , compact snrs , for example , sn  1993j @xcite . however , even the most luminous radio snr , sn  1988z ( @xmath29 ) , generated a radio power at 8.4  ghz of @xmath30  w  hz@xmath2 at the maximum in its light curve @xcite .",
    "the sources detected with jvn clearly exceed this limit , excluding a compact snr origin . although the radio powers taken from a sample of the most radio - luminous starbursts are @xmath31@xmath32  w  hz@xmath2",
    "@xcite , these brightness temperatures were derived to be @xmath33  k , much less than those of the detected radio - loud nls1s .",
    "thus , the stellar origin should be ruled out .",
    "previously , based on the sensitivity of @xmath27@xmath34  k , vlbi imaging has been used to prove that radio emissions associated with agns are powered by a nonthermal process related to the activity of a central engine , not only for strong radio agn classes but also weak radio agn classes , such as seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , ) and radio - quiet quasars ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the radio emissions detected from our nls1 sample are also likely to be related to the activity of central engines .",
    "nonthermal jets are presumably associated with them , although the jvn images did not resolve any structures .",
    "sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 , the most radio - loud nls1 , has been resolved with vlbi into multiple radio components with very high brightness temperatures requiring doppler boosting @xcite , indicating highly relativistic jets .",
    "possible jet structures have also been found with vlbi in ngc  5506 @xcite , a radio - quiet nls1 candidate @xcite . in the limited dynamic ranges ,",
    "the jvn images have presumably shown an unresolved core as the base of jets or one of the compact hot - spots in radio lobes in these radio - loud nls1s .     in detail . filled and open circles represent objects with steep spectrum and inverted spectrum , respectively ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "five large plots represent objects observed with jvn in the present study . ]",
    "we now discuss the relationship between the radio loudness and the radio spectral index .",
    "we made the plot of radio loudness vs.  radio power using ( a )  the nine radio - loud nls1s listed in , including the five nls1s observed with jvn ( see , section  [ section : sample ] ) , and ( b )  the most radio - loud narrow - line quasar sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 ( @xmath35 ; @xcite ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : rl - p5ghz ] .",
    "rxs  j00449 + 1921 , one of the sample in , was excluded from the plot because recent observations have found it to be radio - quiet @xcite .",
    "total flux densities at 1.45  ghz were taken from for these nls1s , except for he  0132@xmath84313 at 4.858.4  ghz @xcite , pks  0558@xmath8504 at 2.74.85  ghz , and sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 at 1.434.86  ghz @xcite .",
    "we discovered that the four inverted spectrum sources are the four most radio - loud objects : sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 with @xmath35 , 2e  1640 + 5345 with @xmath36 , rxs  j16446 + 2619 with @xmath37 , and rxs  j16290 + 4007 with @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests that there could be some connection between a strong low - frequency absorption and the high values of radio loudness .",
    "we discuss two possibilities to cause the combination of the high radio loudness and the strong absorption .",
    "( 1 )  one possibility is doppler beaming effect on jets . the radio flux density from jets",
    "could have been boosted by a factor of @xmath39 ( doppler factor ) , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the source speed ) , and @xmath22 is the angle between the direction of the source velocity and our line of sight , although the optical emission from accretion disk is not affected : higher radio loudness could be achieved .",
    "the peak frequency of a self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum could be enhanced by a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "the frequency range where an inverted spectrum could be seen would extend to our observing frequency .",
    "doppler beaming in an nls1 has already been established by variability @xcite and vlbi studies @xcite for sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 , the most radio - loud object in fig .",
    "[ figure : rl - p5ghz ] .",
    "( 2 )  another possibility is a very compact radio lobe .",
    "giga - hertz peaked spectrum objects  ( gpss ; @xcite for a review ) are strong , compact radio sources , and thought to be in a very early stage  ( @xmath44  yr ) on the evolution of radio galaxies .",
    "the radio lobes of gpss are probably self - absorbed due to high brightness , and its spectral evolution throughout the evolution of radio galaxy has been suggested ( e.g. , @xcite ) . according to the evolution framework ,",
    "radio lobes become more luminous and less absorbed with age . however , although we used the limited number of radio - loud nls1s , we can not find any evidence of such an expected tendency in fig .  [",
    "figure : rl - p5ghz ] : inverted ( i.e. , strongly absorbed ) spectra are rather seen at a high radio power regime .",
    "it is less likely that radio - loud nls1s are a kind of gpss .",
    "therefore , we suggest the possibility that doppler boosting has affected the radio loudness of these nls1s showing inverted spectra",
    ".    we also have radio - loud nls1s with steep ( @xmath45 ) spectra .",
    "at least our vlbi detections have revealed the existence of components with high brightness temperatures in the three steep spectrum radio - loud nls1s , as well as the two inverted spectrum ones . in case of @xmath46 , more than about half of the 1.4  ghz vla flux densities ( table  [ table : sample ] ) have been retrieved with jvn at 8.4  ghz , implying that a compact nonthermal component made a major contribution toward total radio fluxes .",
    "however , we have little suggestion about the reason why they are radio - loud",
    ". there may be following possibilities .",
    "( 1 )  doppler beaming may exist but mildly affected : there would be an insufficient boosting on frequency , but a sufficient boosting on radio flux to the observables , due to only @xmath43-times boosting on frequency , but @xmath39-times boosting on flux density .",
    "( 2 )  these nls1s may have significant jet structures that can provide a radio power sufficient to being radio - loud but can not be resolved at the spatial resolution of jvn , @xmath47  mas@xmath48  mas . in the condition of equipartition between synchrotron electrons and magnetic fields ,",
    "a diameter of about 0.4  mas or more would be needed for a component size in these nls1s so that a jet can be optically - thin ( i.e. , steep spectrum ) at frequencies higher than 1.4  ghz .",
    "even if radio lobes with a size of 1  mas or less possibly resided in these nls1s , they could not be resolved with jvn beams .",
    "we can not ruled out either of the possibilities only by the present study .",
    "we have carried out another vlbi observation for the same sample at 1.7  ghz with the us very long baseline array  ( vlba ) , and the results will be reported in a future paper .",
    "we expect that radio properties of the radio - loud nls1s will be revealed in more detail , because optically - thin , extended synchrotron emissions would be detected more easily at such a low frequency .",
    "we observed five radio - loud nls1s at 8.4  ghz with the japanese vlbi network  ( jvn ) using a phase - referencing technique .",
    "all the targets were detected and unresolved in mas resolutions , i.e. , with brightness temperatures higher than 10@xmath4910@xmath50  k. vlbi - detected flux densities kept four out of the five sources still radio - loud .",
    "radio powers mainly originate in the nonthermal processes of agn activity in central engines , rather than starbursts .",
    "we argued the properties of nonthermal jets in these nls1s .",
    "the two most radio - loud objects in our sample , rxs  j16290 + 4007 and rxs  j16446 + 2619 , showed inverted spectra between vla flux densities at 1.4  ghz and jvn ones at 8.4  ghz . with nine radio - loud nls1s , we also found that the four most radio - loud objects exclusively have inverted spectra .",
    "we suggest there is a possibility that the radio emissions of these nls1s are enhanced by doppler beaming , which can change both radio loudness and the peak frequency of synchrotron self - absorption spectra .",
    "the jvn project is led by the national astronomical observatory of japan  ( naoj ) that is a branch of the national institutes of natural sciences  ( nins ) , hokkaido university , gifu university , yamaguchi university , and kagoshima university , in cooperation with the geographical survey institute  ( gsi ) , the japan aerospace exploration agency  ( jaxa ) , and the national institute of information and communications technology  ( nict ) .",
    "we have made use of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service , the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory ; it also has made use of ned wright s on - line cosmology calculator .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc ."
