    "more than 500 kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) have been discovered since the first , 1992 qb1 , was detected almost a decade ago .",
    "nearly all of these are currently within 50  au of the sun , and only one has been detected beyond 54  au , despite surveys sensitive enough to detect 160  km - diameter kbos to 60  au .",
    "such surveys have placed strong upper limits on the density of kbos in an outer kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the observed absence of distant kbos , each with distinctly different predictions for the kuiper belt beyond 50  au , and distinctly different implications for the history of the solar system .    in the simplest view of the kuiper belt",
    ", the region beyond 50  au , where the gravitational perturbations of the giant planets become negligible , has remained dynamically cold , with kbos moving on their primordial circular and coplanar orbits .",
    "it is inferred that the region inside 48  au has been heavily depopulated , by a factor of 10 - 100 in mass , over the age of the solar system as a result of planetary perturbations and mutual collisions @xcite . in the absence of such perturbations ,",
    "the outer disk is expected to be a factor of 5100 times as dense as the presently observed inner kuiper belt . however , as yet no discovered kbo has been determined to be in a circular orbit beyond 48  au .",
    "shallow surveys , with typical magnitude limits of @xmath5 , have searched for kbos in more than @xmath6 of sky , but objects at @xmath7  au must be @xmath8  km in diameter to be detected in such surveys .",
    "( in quoting sizes of kbos in this paper , we assume a 4% albedo . )",
    "it is desirable to search for smaller objects since the growth timescales for kbos in the outer kuiper belt , though highly uncertain , are likely longer than in the inner kuiper belt .",
    "only a few square degrees , however , have been surveyed to magnitudes @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that if the outer disk were dynamically very cold , thus restricted to a thin line on the sky , it could have easily slipped between the previous sparse deep survey fields . the most likely location for",
    "this distant cold disk would be the invariable plane , the plane normal to the total angular momentum of the solar system , which is inclined 16 to the ecliptic @xcite .",
    "most deep kbo surveys , including our previously published results @xcite[abm ] , have been conducted close to the ecliptic plane , possibly missing a thin disk near the invariable plane .",
    "we have therefore supplemented the abm survey with four new fields that are strategically chosen on the sky to maximize the likelihood of detecting a thin trans - neptunian disk near the invariable plane .",
    "we present here new limits on a putative cold disk beyond 50  au that result from our observations in these new survey fields combined with previously published data .",
    "the new observations were taken with the kpno mayall 4-m telescope and mosaic camera , during two consecutive nights in march 2001 .",
    "the observation and reduction methodologies are identical to those of abm . in brief : data were taken using a broad - band @xmath10 filter similar to that described in @xcite . each field",
    "is observed in a series of 7 to 9 exposures each night , each exposure 480  s long .",
    "the images were registered and then combined with a `` digital tracking '' technique to search for faint moving objects : after registration , the images from each night are summed ( with sigma - clipping rejection ) into a deep template .",
    "this template is then subtracted from each individual image in the opposing night , after matching the point spread functions .",
    "this removes all stationary objects from each image , leaving only moving objects and cosmic rays .",
    "these blank images are searched individually for bright kbos , then combined at potential kbo motion vectors to search for faint slow - moving objects .",
    "the images were combined tens of thousands of times to search all likely orbits between 30 and 100  au .",
    "as the observations were taken in fields very near opposition , the distance can be estimated to within 10% from the apparent velocity . although we can not determine orbits with the short ( two - night ) observational arc obtained here ,",
    "a distance alone is usually sufficient to exclude the possibility of a distant circular orbit .",
    "we discovered 10 new kbos in this 2001 survey data , over an effective area of @xmath11 .",
    "the effective area is simply the subtended survey area multiplied by the detection efficiency ",
    "the latter factor being probability of detecting a kbo at a particular magnitude .",
    "the effective area is determined by inserting hundreds of artificial moving objects into the data , then repeating the search process . in our 2001 survey ,",
    "the detection efficiency drops by 50% at a magnitude of @xmath12 due to noise , but has no dependence on velocity or distance as all kbos within 200  au will move appreciably in the two - night baseline .",
    "this limiting magnitude varies from field to field due to seeing and integration - time variations , while the peak detection efficiency varies primarily with stellar density and field overlap .",
    "data for each field are listed in table  [ fieldtable ] and the details for each discovered object are listed in table  [ objtable ] .",
    "also included in the tables are details of the fields and detected objects from the 1998 and 1999 abm data , which have an effective area of 1.3 square degrees with mean limiting magnitude of @xmath13 .",
    "altogether , our surveys between 1998 and 2001 cover 2.3 square degrees and we discovered a total of 33 kbos and 1 centaur .",
    "the discovered objects were found at distances between 20 and 53  au , but none of the objects beyond 48  au are on circular orbits . in our 2001 survey , no kbos were found beyond 46  au .",
    "we have clearly detected no possible distant cold disk members , even though we could have detected kbos larger than @xmath14=185  km to distances of 55  au or greater over nearly the entire survey area with our stated magnitude limits .",
    "figure  [ invfields ] shows in invariable - plane coordinates the extent of the abm fields ( a  g ) , the new fields ( h  l ) , and other authors surveys .",
    "the heavy line is the ecliptic plane ( the plane containing the orbit of the earth ) , about which the previous surveys are clustered . observing in the ecliptic rather than",
    "the invariable plane ( the total angular momentum plane of the solar system ) has been the norm , as the difference between the two is not important when considering a thick disk such as the kuiper belt inside 50  au .",
    "it is only when searching for a disk with vertical dispersion @xmath15 that this difference becomes significant .",
    "deep kbo surveys conducted by other researchers @xcite generally cover too little area ( on the order of a keck field @xmath16 ) to provide additional constraints on a thin disk . in the analysis described in the next section , we have included the kbo survey by @xcite , conducted with the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "this survey discovered 1999  dg8 , for which a one - night arc suggests a distance of @xmath17  au .",
    "this is the _ only _ known object which could have a circular orbit beyond 50  au , but the short arc means that the eccentricity of the orbit is completely indeterminate  it could easily be a scattered disk member . for the following analysis we must calculate the probability of cold disk models being consistent with the observations .",
    "we sum the probabilities of the model yielding 1 or 0 objects in the @xcite cfht field , since the nature of 1999  dg8 is indeterminate .",
    "this , along with the high latitude of the field [ 1.5 to 2 deg to the invariable plane ] , substantially weaken its ability to constrain a cold disk in the invariable plane .",
    "we did not detect any kbos beyond 50  au in the primordial , circular orbits expected of objects in a distant cold disk .",
    "we wish to constrain the total number of kbos which could be resident in such a disk .",
    "we will consider only kbos with diameter @xmath18  km , since such objects are detectable at @xmath19 efficiency in all our fields at a distance of 55  au , assuming 4% albedo .",
    "we express the total population @xmath20 of @xmath3  km objects between 50 and 60  au as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of classical kbos ( ckbos ) larger than @xmath23  km .",
    "@xcite determine @xmath24 .",
    "the cold disk is assumed to have some inclination @xmath25 and ascending node @xmath26 relative to the invariable plane .",
    "the surface density of cold disk objects on the sky is assumed to have a gaussian distribution in the vertical direction with dispersion @xmath27 , and to be uniform with disk longitude .",
    "an exponential vertical distribution yields similar results for most disk widths .",
    "we ask then what is the probability @xmath28 of a given disk model yielding the observations @xmath29 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all the @xmath20 objects in the 5060  au range have the apparent magnitude @xmath30 that a @xmath23  km object would have at a distance of 55  au .",
    "this is conservative in the sense that many of the objects would presumably be larger and brighter , but we do not want to assume any particular size distribution for the cold - disk members .",
    "note that for @xmath31 , we may imagine taking the ckbo population , collapsing ( cooling ) it down to a thin disk , then moving the disk out from its present 3848  au annulus to a 5060  au annulus .",
    "if the `` classical '' belt is truly a depleted and excited inner portion of the full kuiper belt , then this is a lower bound to the expected distant disk .    for chosen disk parameters",
    "@xmath32 , we convolve the model sky surface density with the survey geometry and detection efficiencies specified in table  [ fieldtable ] , yielding an expected number of detections .",
    "the expected number of detections for each field , @xmath33 , for each cold disk orientation is then @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the detection efficiency in each field , @xmath36 is the field width and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the top and bottom field latitudes in the cold disk plane .",
    "since the actual number of detections is zero ( save possibly for 1999  dg8 in the cfht field ) , @xmath39 is easily calculated from poisson statistics .",
    "a given disk configuration is excluded at 95% confidence if @xmath40 detections are expected .    as an example ,",
    "74% of the nodes of a very thin disk ( @xmath41 ) inclined at @xmath42 to the invariable plane , are ruled out at the @xmath43% confidence level for @xmath31 .",
    "most of the remaining un - excluded disks travel through our field h , due to its slightly brighter limiting magnitude .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath41 disks which are _ not _ ruled out by our deep fields are plotted in figure  [ invfields ] .    to simplify the interpretation ,",
    "we marginalize over the ascending node @xmath26 by assuming a uniform prior distribution in the interval @xmath45 : @xmath46 figure  [ disksout ] plots the probability @xmath47 . as we allow the cold disk model to be more inclined to the invariable plane",
    ", our limits become weaker because these disks more easily dodge the surveyed fields .",
    "our limits also become weaker as the model disks become thicker , at inclinations @xmath48 , since the sky density of the kbos drops in our fields .",
    "this situation reverses at higher inclinations , where the thicker disks ( @xmath49 ) are more likely to be detected , as they are unable to slip between our fields and the inclination variation matters less .",
    "if we assume that the distant cold disk must be located in the invariable plane , then we can place further limits on how many objects larger than 185  km could exist between 5060  au without being detected in our survey .",
    "figure  [ diskwidths ] plots the value of @xmath50 at which @xmath51 , as a function of disk thickness @xmath27 . a thin disk ( @xmath52 ) must have less than half as many @xmath3  km kbos as the classical kuiper belt ( @xmath53 at 95% cl ) .",
    "an @xmath54 distant disk with the same number of objects as the inner belt must have @xmath55 to have a @xmath56 chance of escaping detection in the surveys to date .",
    "the apparent width of the classical kuiper belt is @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "if the outer disk has the same width instead of being dynamically colder , an increase of factor @xmath58 over the classical belt population is ruled out at the 95% cl .",
    "the case of equivalent inner- and outer - disk sky distributions in considered in more detail in abm .    by also marginalizing over the inclination",
    ", we can place similar limits on @xmath50 for cold disks within @xmath59 of the invariable plane .",
    "assuming that the model disk pole locations are uniformly distributed in polar area , then @xmath60 we can then find @xmath50 at which @xmath61 , plotted in figure  [ diskwidths ] as the solid line .",
    "we can place tighter limits on a disk in the invariable plane , as above , than on any disk in any inclination up to @xmath59 because more of our fields were located in the invariable plane .",
    "however , we find for @xmath62 we can exclude at 95% cl or better the existence of a distant disk at any inclination @xmath2 to the invariable plane that contains at least 1.2 times as many @xmath3  km kbos as the classical kuiper belt .",
    "we have provided strong limits on the existence of a distant cold disk .",
    "the simple expectation of a dense thin disk in the invariable plane appears to be ruled out .",
    "however , it is possible that a thin disk composed of objects smaller than @xmath23  km , undetectable in much of our survey , is present .",
    "this would require an extreme change in the size distribution of kbos just beyond @xmath6350  au , as objects larger than @xmath64  km have been found at distances near 50  au .",
    "it is not clear what would cause such a large and sudden change in the size distribution .",
    "other explanations for the observed lack of distant kbos involve dropping the density of objects beyond 50  au .",
    "one possibility is that the outer kuiper belt was dynamically excited by a stellar encounter early in the history of the solar system @xcite .",
    "an increase in the mean eccentricity and inclination of distant kbos , thus lowering their apparent sky density and possibly halting accretion of large kbos , would make a distant disk much harder to detect .",
    "dynamical excitation by a stellar encounter results in a distinctive orbital distribution of kbos , and could yield limits on the birth cluster environment of the solar system @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to explain the lack of kbos beyond 50  au if the primordial planetesimal disk ended at this distance . if neptune and uranus have migrated significantly over the age of the solar system @xcite , the primordial solar nebula surface density beyond @xmath65  au could have been very small initially",
    "this could suggest that the larger kbos actually formed interior to 3040 au and were displaced to their present orbits by a large scale rearrangement of orbits in the outer solar system .",
    "circumstellar disks around other stars have been observed to have diameters ranging between 501000  au @xcite .",
    "a truncation of the solar nebula near 50  au would fit easily within this range , with important implications for planetary formation models of our solar system .    in order to distinguish between these theories and",
    "further constrain the distant kb population , deeper and wider survey observations of the kuiper belt ( to limiting magnitudes of @xmath66 ) will be necessary . based on the limits we have found here ,",
    "a survey covering approximately 20 square degrees near the invariable plane should be able to detect a distant disk dynamically excited to a thickness of 10  with even half the number of objects as the ckb .",
    "this would constrain the density and distribution of the kuiper belt at distances beyond 50  au , including the scattered disk objects , enabling a better comparison between our solar system and extrasolar systems .",
    "we thank l. strolger and m. holman for attempting to recover some of these objects , and the staff at kitt peak national observatory for their excellent support .",
