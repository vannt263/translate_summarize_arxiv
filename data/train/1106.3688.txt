    "in this paper ( paper i ) , we resolve the long - standing problem of the distance to  by measuring its trigonometric parallax , ie , triangulating using the earth s orbit as one leg of the triangle and measuring the change in its apparent position as the earth orbits the sun .",
    "our results are based on observations of compact radio emission with the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "previously , only one trigonometric parallax has been published for a binary containing a black hole : v404  cyg , an x - ray binary with a low - mass ( @xmath1 ) companion star  @xcite .",
    "our result is the first trigonometric parallax for an x - ray binary with a massive companion ( @xmath2 ) ; an accurate distance is key to achieving secure and detailed models of the physical properties of the binary system .",
    "was the first black hole ( bh ) candidate to be established via dynamical observations @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most well - studied black hole systems with excellent optical and x - ray data .",
    "however , modeling this system is limited by its very uncertain distance",
    ". distance estimates span a very large range , with most values between 1.8 and 2.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "the  distance estimate with the smallest _ formal _ uncertainty is @xmath3 kpc by @xcite and is based on photometry and spectroscopy of ngc 6871 ( an open cluster in the cyg ob3 complex ) .",
    "while this distance estimate is very precise , its true accuracy ( including systematic sources of error involving extinction , metallicity corrections , and stellar modeling ) is perhaps @xmath4% .",
    "also , it ( and many other distance estimates ) relies on the association of  with the cyg ob3 complex . while such an association is supported by similar stellar ( hipparcos ) and  ( vlbi ) proper motion measurements",
    "@xcite , it still must be considered tentative as this line - of - sight through the milky way is very `` crowded , '' passing nearly parallel to the local spiral arm , which extends at least several kpc from the sun , and then through the perseus and outer arms at greater distances @xcite .",
    "our observations were conducted under vlba program br141 . we observed  and two background sources over 10-hour tracks at five epochs : 2009 january 23 , april 13 , july 13 , october 31 and 2010 january 25 .",
    "these dates well sample the peaks of the sinusoidal trigonometric parallax signature in both right ascension and declination .",
    "this sampling provides near maximum sensitivity for parallax detection and ensures that we can separate the secular proper motion ( caused by projections of galactic rotation , as well as any peculiar motion of  and the sun ) from the sinusoidal parallax effect .",
    "table  [ table : positions ] lists the positions of  and the background continuum sources , as well as their angular separations from .",

    "we placed observations of well - known strong sources near the beginning , middle and end of the observations in order to monitor delay and electronic phase differences among the intermediate frequency bands . in practice , however , we found minimal drifts and used only a single scan of j2005 + 7752 for this calibration .    in order to calibrate atmospheric propagation delays , we scheduled `` geodetic blocks '' consisting of typically a dozen icrf sources @xcite observed over a wide range of source azimuths and elevations as describe in @xcite .",
    "we observed in left circular polarization and spread eight 16-mhz bands so as to span @xmath7 mhz of bandwidth .",
    "we corrected the interferometer data for ionospheric delays using global models of the total electron content obtained from global positioning system observations @xcite .",
    "residual multi - band delays and fringe rates were measured and used as data to solve for clock offsets and drift rates and unmodeled zenith atmospheric propagation path delays . later these were removed from the rapid - switching ( parallax ) data .",
    "the rapid - switching observations employed four adjacent frequency bands of 16-mhz bandwidth and recorded both right and left circularly polarized signals .",
    "the four ( dual - polarized ) bands were centered at frequencies of 8.425 , 8.441 , 8.457 and 8.473 ghz .",
    "we alternated between two @xmath8  min blocks , each consisting of observations of  and one of the background sources . within a block",
    ", we switched sources every 40  s , typically achieving 30  s of on - source data .",
    "we used the background sources j1953 + 3537 and j1957 + 3338 for phase - referencing .",
    "we calibrated the correlated data using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the calibration sequence included four steps . the first step involved correction of interferometer delays and phases for the effects of diurnal feed rotation ( parallactic angle ) , for errors in the values of the earth s orientation parameters used at the time of correlation , and for any small position shifts in the _ a priori _ coordinates of either the maser or background sources .",
    "since the vlba correlator model includes no ionospheric delays , we used global total electron content models to remove ionospheric effects . at this point",
    ", we also corrected the data for residual zenith atmospheric delays and clock drifts ( determined from the geodetic block data ) .    in the second step , we adjusted interferometer visibility amplitudes for the small ( few % ) effects of biases in the threshold levels of the data samplers at each station .",
    "we also entered system temperature and antenna gain curve information into calibration tables , which allows conversion of correlation coefficients to flux density units . in the third step",
    ", we performed a `` manual phase - calibration '' to remove delay and phase differences among all eight 16-mhz bands .",
    "this was done by selecting one scan on a strong calibrator , fitting fringe patterns to the data for each frequency band , and then shifting delays and phases to remove offsets .",
    "the fourth calibration step involved determining antenna - based complex gains from each of the two background sources and interpolating and removing those from the  observations . for most antennas at most times the phases were easily `` connected . ''",
    "however , when interferometer phase differences between adjacent background source scans exceeded @xmath9 , the data between those times were discarded .",
    "we then imaged the calibrated data with the aips task imagr .",
    "the synthesized `` dirty '' beam typically had a full - width at half - maximum of @xmath10 mas elongated approximately in the north - south direction .",
    "we adopted a round convolving - beam of 1.0 mas to construct clean images .",
    "example images from the middle epoch are shown in fig .",
    "[ images ] .",
    "positions were determined by fitting elliptical gaussian brightness distributions to the images . for , which shows a core - jet structure , we restricted the fitted pixels to those close to the bright core , typically within 1  mas of the peak emission .",
    "the peak brightness of  ranged between 4 and 9 mjy beam@xmath11 among our observations .",
    "the change in position of  relative to a background continuum source was then modeled by the parallax sinusoid in both coordinates , completely determined by one parameter ( the parallax ) , and a secular proper motion in each coordinate ( see fig .  [ parallax_fits ] ) .",
    "the model included the effects of the ellipticity of the earth s orbit .",
    "the weighting of the data in the parallax and proper motion fitting is complicated because the formal position uncertainties are often unrealistically small , since _ a priori _ unknown sources of systematic error often dominate over random noise .",
    "the north - south components of relative positions often have greater uncertainty than the east - west components , because the interferometer beams are generally larger in the north - south direction and systematic errors from unmodeled atmospheric delays usually are more strongly correlated with north - south positions @xcite .    in order to allow for , and estimate the magnitude of , systematic errors",
    ", we assigned independent `` error floors '' to the east - west and north - south position data and added these floors in quadrature with the formal position - fitting uncertainties .",
    "trial parallax and proper motion fits were conducted and a reduced @xmath12 ( per degree of freedom ) statistic was calculated separately for the east - west and north - south residuals .",
    "the error floors were then adjusted iteratively so as to make @xmath13 for each coordinate .",
    "this procedure resulted in error floors of 0.08 and 0.16  mas for the eastward and northward position measurements , respectively .",
    "the magnitudes of these error floors are reasonably consistent with those obtained for other parallax targets observed at 8.4 ghz , @xcite , and are probably dominated by unmodeled ionospheric delays .",
    "any component of variability in the centroid of the core - jet position of   caused by changing jet opacity must be less than @xmath14  mas .",

    "first , we attempted separate parallax fits for each background source measurement .",
    "the parallaxes for  for the two background sources differ by only 0.071  mas and are consistent with their individual formal uncertainties of about 0.06  mas .",
    "this agreement suggests that neither atmospheric mis - modeling nor potential unresolved structural variations in the background sources contribute position errors greater than the error floors .",
    "next , because of the agreement of the  parallaxes and proper motions for the two background sources , we did a combined fit with common parallax and proper motion parameters for both sets of data .",
    "( in the combined fit , we did allow for different position offsets for  with respect to each background source , since the _ a priori _ positions for these sources were not known to better than @xmath30  mas . )    finally , we investigated the effect of the  binary orbit on the parallax fits .",
    "all orbital parameters are known with reasonable accuracy and were considered as independent variables @xcite , with the exception of the direction of the orbital rotation on the sky .",
    "the binary orbital model we adopted had an orbital period of 5.599829  d , superior conjunction at jd 2441874.707  d , a radius of the radio source about the center of mass of 0.128  au , an inclination of @xmath31 ( ie , the angle between the orbit angular momentum vector and our line - of - sight ) .",
    "( using the revised value of @xmath32 , determined in paper ii , results in no significant difference in parallax and proper motion fits . )",
    "we assumed an orbital angular momentum vector parallel to the radio jet in , observed in our images ( see fig .  [ images ] ) and previous studies @xcite to be about @xmath33 east of north .",
    "this leaves two possible orbital directions , clockwise ( cw ) and counterclockwise ( ccw ) on the sky , to be determined by the data .",
    "parallax and proper motion fits for both orbital directions are listed in table  [ table : fits ] .",
    "the @xmath34 value for the cw orbit was 8.49 ( for 13 degrees of freedom ) , which was significantly lower than the value of 16.81 for the ccw orbit .",
    "the agreement of the data with the cw orbit model can be seen in the position data in fig .",
    "[ fit_with_orbit ] , especially in the more accurate eastward offset data .",
    "thus , our astrometric observations appear to be sensitive to the position changes caused by orbit of the radio source ( presumably the black hole ) about the center of mass of the binary system , and we have directly determined the direction of the orbit to be clock - wise on the sky .    adopting the cw orbit , we re - fitted the data allowing the orbital radius to vary and found a radius of @xmath35  au .",
    "thus , the current vlba data independently gives a @xmath36 estimate of the radius of the compact radio source about the center of mass of the binary . with more observations in the future",
    ", we could refine the values of some of the  orbital parameters .",
    "we adopt a  parallax of @xmath37  mas from the fit with the lowest @xmath12 value . that fit combined the data from both background sources and used the orbital model with clockwise projected motion on the sky .",
    "this parallax for  corresponds to a distance of @xmath0  kpc . at this distance",
    ", the proper motion of  corresponds to @xmath38  and @xmath39  eastward and northward , respectively . completing the full space velocity ,",
    "the average heliocentric radial velocity of  is about @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "since we have measured the position , parallax , proper motion , and others have measured the line - of - sight velocity , we have full three - dimensional position and velocity information for .",
    "we can convert this velocity vector from the equatorial heliocentric reference frame in which they are measured into a galactic reference frame .",
    "a convenient galactic frame is one rotating with a circular velocity @xmath41 at the position of the source : ie , a `` local standard of rest '' at the location of .",
    "this transformation is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "conversion to a rotating galactic reference frame depends somewhat upon the solar motion and galactic parameters .",
    "we adopt the distance of the sun from the galactic center of @xmath42 kpc as a rounded average of the values quoted by @xcite for a variety of `` classical '' techniques and by @xcite and @xcite from the orbits of stars about the supermassive black hole at the galactic center .",
    "the rotation speed of the local standard of rest is @xmath43 , which is based on this distance and the proper motion of sgr  a * ( the super - massive black hole at the galactic center ) , which directly measures @xmath44  kpc@xmath11 @xcite . using the newly proposed solar motion of @xmath45   by @xcite , and assuming a locally flat rotation curve ,  @xmath46",
    ", we find a `` peculiar motion '' ( relative to circular motion ) for  of @xmath47  toward the galactic center , @xmath48   in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath49  toward the north galactic pole .",
    "thus , the total magnitude of the peculiar motion of  is only 21  , indicating that the binary system did not experience a large `` kick '' when the black hole formed .",
    "this result supports the conjecture that the black hole may have formed without a supernova explosion  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite modeled the scattering by interstellar dust grains of x - rays from .",
    "they considered 18 models describing the characteristics of dust and selected six models with iron column densities consistent with a value of @xmath50  @xmath51 ( lee et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "modeling the x - ray light - curves , three of the six yielded distances between 3.15 and 3.59 kpc , and these models were discarded as being incompatible with our trigonometric parallax .",
    "the remaining three models yielded distances between 1.72 and 1.90 kpc , compatible with our parallax .",
    "thus , having an accurate trigonometic parallax can be important for the study of x - ray scattering from time varying sources .",
    "the black hole in  is fed gas via the stellar wind emanating from its o - type companion , which underfills its roche equipotential lobe . the degree",
    "to which the star underfills its roche lobe must be tightly constrained in order to obtain a useful dynamical model of the system , and accurate knowledge of the source distance is necessary to accomplish this  @xcite . using the accurate distance , @xmath52 , reported here , we have constructed such a model and obtained precise values for the mass , @xmath53 , of the black hole , the orbital inclination angle , @xmath54 , and other system parameters , as reported in paper ii  @xcite . with the required , accurate values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath52 in hand",
