    "bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) are now usually clubbed together and called blazars ; they represent a small subset of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) characterized by strong and rapid flux variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "blazars exhibit strong polarization from radio to optical wavelengths and usually have core - dominated radio structures .",
    "these extreme agns provide a natural laboratory to study the mechanisms of energy extraction from the central supermassive black holes and the physical properties of jets and perhaps accretion disks . according to the orientation based unified model of radio - loud agns",
    ", blazar jets usually make an angle @xmath3 to our line - of - sight ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic ( em ) radiation from blazars is predominantly non - thermal . at lower frequencies ( through the uv or x - ray bands )",
    "the mechanism is almost certainly synchrotron emission while at higher frequencies the emission mechanism is probably due to inverse - compton ( ic ) emission ( e.g. , sikora & madejski 2001 ; krawczynski 2004 ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars have a double - peaked structure ( e.g. , giommi , ansari & micol 1995 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1997 ; fossati et al .  1998 ) .",
    "based on the location of the first peak of their seds , @xmath4 , and blazars are often sub - classified into low energy peaked blazars ( lbls ) and high energy peaked blazars ( hbls ) ( padovani & giommi 1995 ) ; however , it should be noted that the sed peaks can be located at intermediate frequencies as well , giving rise to the intermediate peaks blazar ( ibl ) classification ( e.g. , sambruna , maraschi & urry 1996 ) .",
    "the first component peaks in the near - infrared ( nir)/optical in case of lbls and at uv / x - rays in hbls , while the second component usually peaks at gev energies in lbls and at tev energies in hbls .",
    "more specifically , nieppola , tornikoski & valtaoja ( 2006 ) classify over 300 bl lacs and suggest that blazars with @xmath5 hz are lbls , those with @xmath6 hz are ibls and those with @xmath7 hz are hbls .",
    "observations of blazars reveal that they are variable at all accessible timescales , from a few tens of minutes to years and even decades at many frequencies ( e.g. , aller et al .",
    "1992 ; carini & miller 1992a ; carini et al .  1992b ; wagner & witzel 1995 ; gupta et al .  2004 ; tersranta et al .",
    "2004 ; ostorero et al .",
    "2006 ; villata et al .  2007 ;",
    "dammando et al .",
    "2009 ) . based on these different timescales",
    ", the variability of blazars can be broadly divided into three classes , e.g. , intra - day variability ( idv ) , short - term variability ( stv ) , and long - term variability ( ltv ) .",
    "variations in the flux of a source of a couple of hundredths of a magnitude up to a few tenths of magnitude over a time scale of a day or less is known as idv ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) or microvariability or intra - night optical variability .",
    "flux changes over days to a few months are often considered to be stv , while those taking from several months to many years are usually called ltv ( e.g. , gupta et al .",
    "2004 ) ; both of these classes of variations typically exceed @xmath2 1 magnitude and can exceed even 5 magnitudes .",
    "the study of variability is one of the most powerful tools for revealing the nature of blazars and probing the various processes occurring in them . over the last two decades",
    ", the optical / nir variability of blazars has been extensively studied on diverse timescales ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "1989 ; carini et al .  1992b ; courvoisier et al .",
    "1995 ; heidt & wagner 1996 ; takalo et al . 1996",

    "tersranta et al .",
    "1992 , 2004 ; rani et al .  2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "there are several theoretical models that might be able to explain the observed variability over wide time - scales for all bands , with the leading contenders based upon shocks propagating down relativistic jets ( e.g. , marscher & gear 1985 ; qian et al .  1991 ; hughes , aller & aller 1991 ; marscher , gear & travis 1992 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ; marscher 1996 )",
    ". some of the variability may arise from helical structures , precession or other geometrical effects occurring within the jets ( e.g. , camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ;",
    "gopal - krishna & wiita 1992 ) and some of the radio variability is due to extrinsic propagative effects ( e.g. , rickett et al .",
    "hot spots or disturbances in or above accretion disks surrounding the black holes at the centers of agns ( e.g. , mangalam & wiita 1993 ; chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ) are likely to play a key role in the variability of non - blazar agns and might provide seed fluctuations that could be advected into the a blazar jet and then doppler amplified .    in this work we aimed to search for stv in the multi - band fluxes and colours of a sample of twelve lbls that consists of six bl lacs and six fsrqs and to thereby cast more light on the emission mechanisms responsible for these variations .",
    "our work is mainly focused on day to day variations in the magnitudes as well as the colours of these dozen sources which were the brightest blazars visible from india and bulgaria . throughout this paper when we use the term colour variation we mean a change in the colour of a blazar with time . optical flux variations in blazars",
    "are often associated with changes in their spectral shapes .",
    "these can be quantified by studying the properties of the colour indices of each source .",
    "so we have also investigated the spectral variabilities in the observed visible wavebands of lbls and have investigated if there are differences between spectral variability trends in those classified as bl lacs and those called fsrqs .",
    "we have also studied the spectral variability of these lbls with changes in the brightness of the sources .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the observations and data reduction procedure .",
    "section 3 provides our results , which are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "our observations of twelve lbls were performed using five optical telescopes , one in india and four in bulgaria .",
    "all of these telescopes are equipped with ccd detectors and johnson ubv and cousins ri filters .",
    "details about the telescopes , detectors and other parameters related to the observations are given in table 1 .",
    "a complete log of observations of these lbls from these five telescopes is given in table 2 .",
    "we carried out optical photometric observations during the period september 2008 to june 2009 .",
    "the raw photometric data were processed by standard methods which are briefly described here . for image processing or pre - processing",
    ", we generated a master bias frame for each observing night by taking the median of all bias frames .",
    "the master bias frame for the night was subtracted from all flat and source image frames taken on that night .",
    "then the master flat in each passband was generated by median combine of all flat frames in each passband .",
    "next , the normalized master flat for each passband was generated .",
    "each source image frame was flat - fielded by dividing by the normalized master flat in the respective band to remove pixel - to - pixel inhomogeneities .",
    "finally , cosmic ray removal was done from all source image frames .",
    "data pre - processing used the standard routines in image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) and eso midas software .",
    "we processed the data using the dominion astronomical observatory photometry ( daophot ii ) software to perform the circular concentric aperture photometric technique ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) . for each night",
    "we carried out aperture photometry with four different aperture radii , i.e. , 1@xmath8fwhm , 2@xmath8fwhm , 3@xmath8fwhm and 4@xmath8fwhm .",
    "on comparing the photometric results we found that aperture radii of 2@xmath8fwhm almost always provided the best s / n ratio , so we adopted that aperture for our final results .    for each of the twelve blazars , we observed more than three local standard stars on the same field .",
    "the magnitudes of the standard stars that we measured in the fields of our target sources are given in table 3 .",
    "having multiple standard stars was required to confirm that the final standard stars were truly non - variable .",
    "we employed two non - varying standard stars from each blazar field with magnitudes similar to those of the target and plotted their differential instrumental magnitudes so as to obtain an indication of the noise in the measurements .",
    "finally , to calibrate the photometry of the blazars , we used the one standard star which had a colour closer to that of the blazar .",
    "the calibrated light curves ( lcs ) of these blazars are plotted in the same panel with the differential instrumental magnitudes of those two standard stars in the figures 1 @xmath1 12 .",
    "we used r to write additional programs for data processing .",
    "to search for and describe blazar variability we have employed two quantities commonly used in the literature , the variability detection parameter , @xmath9 , and the variability amplitude , @xmath10 .",
    "the former was introduced by romero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and is defined as the average of @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the differential instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and standard star a and the blazar and standard star b , respectively , while @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the observational scatter of the differential instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and star a , the blazar and star b and stara and star b , respectively .",
    "if @xmath19 , the confidence level of a variability detection is @xmath20% , and we consider this to be a positive detection of a variation .",
    "for a few sources , the ( star a - star b ) lcs show isolated apparently discrepant points , that we conservatively retain in our analysis .",
    "these points increase the @xmath21 values relatively more than the bl  star scatter , thereby slightly reducing the @xmath9 values and the confidence with which variability claims are made .",
    "heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) introduced the variability amplitude , defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the maximum and minimum magnitudes in the calibrated lcs of the blazar and the average measurement error of the blazar lc is @xmath25 .",

    "1998 ; dai et al .",
    "we observed large flux variations in all the sources except 3c 273 during our observing span .",
    "the substantial flux variations we and others have observed in these lbls can be reasonably explained by models that involve relativistic shocks propagating outward ( e.g. , marscher & gear 1985 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ; marscher 1996 ) .",
    "the larger flares are expected to be produced by the emergence and motion of a new shock triggered by some strong variation in a physical quantity such as velocity , electron density or magnetic field moving into and through the relativistic jet .",
    "smaller variations may be nicely explained by turbulence behind a shock propagating down the jet ( marscher et al.1992 ) . in a minority of blazars , gravitational micro - lensing",
    "( e.g. , gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ) might be important .",
    "the one such case among our sample where micro - lensing may play a role is ao 0235@xmath0164 which is known to have two galaxies ( at @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) along our line - of - sight to it .",
    "the variability of blazars has been extensively studied over the past two decades .",
    "still , to the best of our knowledge , we are reporting the most extensive search for optical short term colour variations ( stcv ) , i.e. , variations in colour with time for time periods corresponding to stv , in a sample of lbls .",
    "gu et al .  ( 2006 ) presented monitoring of eight lbls , seven of which are also in our sample of 12 , for about six months during 2003 and 2004 ; their observations were only in the v , r and i bands for six of their sources , though they did also have b band coverage for two of them .",
    "three phenomena that could lead to colour variations with time were discussed by hawkins et al .",
    "( 2002 ) : the effect of the underlying host galaxy ; colour changes in accretion disks ; and colour changes from micro - lensing and we now consider each of these .",
    "the effect of the underlying host galaxy on colour variations of the source is usually seen in the case of low luminosity agns such as seyfert galaxies ( m@xmath55 ) where variable seeing would include more or less of the galaxy s light along with that of the seyfert .",
    "since the fsrqs are among the most luminous agns ( m@xmath56 ) , any colour variation in these sources is most unlikely to arise from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "this is true for bl lacs as well , in that the doppler boosted jet emission almost invariably swamps the light from the host galaxy , thereby often making the determination of redshifts very difficult , as noted above .",
    "the stcv observed in blazar lcs might conceivably come from colour changes arising in the accretion disc itself , particularly for the fsrq class , where accretion disc emission may be significant ( e.g. , malkan 1983 ; pian et al .",
    "1999 ) , although the bl lacs seem to have much weaker disc emission .",
    "the standard model of a geometrically and optically thick accretion disc ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) yields a negative temperature gradient , i.e. , the disc is cooler and redder with increasing radial distance from the central black hole .",
    "hence any non - linear oscillations of such a disc lead to temperature , and hence colour , changes ( hawkins et al .",
    "microlensing of radiation from an accretion disc having the expected radial temperature gradient can also produce variations in colour .",
    "yonehara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) carried out numerical simulations of the microlensing of accretion discs by a compact body and showed that for an optically thick accretion disk with a radial temperature gradient colour variations are seen , while for optically thin accretion discs such induced colour variations are unlikely to be observable .",
    "the blazar ao 0235@xmath0164 showed strong stcv during our observing run and is known to have two foreground galaxies at @xmath53 and @xmath57 ( nilsson et al .",
    "so at least some of the strong variations seen in this source could arise from microlensing of different regions within a relativistic jet ( e.g. , gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ) .",
    "since there are no microlenses known to be in front of the fsrqs pks 0420@xmath1014 , 4c 29.45 and 3c 454.3 , it is possible that the stcv observed in these sources arise from of colour changes in the accretion disc itself .",
    "the usual models for bl lacs attribute the vast bulk of their emission to doppler boosted fluxes from the relativistic jet ( e.g. , scheuer & readhead 1979 ; blandford & knigl 1979 ) . under these circumstances",
    "any accretion disc radiation is always likely to be overwhelmed by that from the jet , just as the galaxy s light also only comprises a small fraction of that observed",
    ". therefore jet models that can produce different fluctuations at different colours are most likely to be able to explain the stv and colour variations we have detected . in the usual boosted synchrotron models involving shocks propagating down the jets ( e.g. , marscher & gear 1985 ; marscher et al .",
    "2008 ) radiation at different frequencies is produced ( or at least emerges when the jet becomes optically thin to it ) at different distances behind the shocks .",
    "typically higher frequency photons emerge sooner ( e.g. , valtaoja et al .   1992 ) .",
    "therefore as we see a blazar brighten or fade we expect to see some differences in the times and rates at which radiation observed at different visible colours rise and fall .",
    "correlated trends in variability between an optical colour index and brightness has been studied by quite a few authors for a number of blazars , although usually just two colours were monitored as opposed to the four we usually could obtain .",
    "the historical optical observations seem to show that the correlation between colour index and magnitude for bl lac objects is such that their spectra become steeper ( redder ) when their fluxes decrease and flatter ( bluer ) when they increase . in this context",
    "the blazar bl lac is one of the most extensively studied objects ( carini et al .",
    "1992b ; massaro et al .",
    "1998 ; nesci et al .",
    "1998 ; webb et al .  1998 ; clements et al .  2001 ; villata et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; gu et al .  2006 ) .",
    "these extensive data show that this source usually follows a bluer - when - brighter trend , both in flaring and nearly steady states .",
    "a similar trend was also observed in s5 0716@xmath0714 ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1997 ; raiteri et al .  2003 ; gu et al .",
    "2006 ) , 3c 66a ( ghosh et al .",
    "2000 ; gu et al .   2006 ) and oj 287 ( carini et al .",
    "1992a ; gu et al .",
    "apart from the apparently general trend in bl lac objects , a redder - when - brighter correlation has sometimes been observed in the bl lacs pks 0735@xmath0178 , 3c 66a and ao 0235@xmath0164 ( ghosh et al .",
    "this overall trend is easily explained if there is a shift to higher peak frequencies during a flare ( e.g. , giommi et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) , but there is as yet no clear understanding as to why such a shift should occur .",
    "the fsrqs have been much less well studied in this regard , but a general redder - when - brighter trend seems to be present in at least two of them , 3c 454.3 and pks 0420@xmath1014 ( gu et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) , as well as another , cta 102 ( osterman meyer et al .  2009 ) .",
    "our data do support the general bluer - when - brighter trend for bl lacs since three of the six bl lacs we examined showed this trend : 3c 66a , s5 0716@xmath0714 and",
    "bl lac itself . in our observations",
    "ao 0235@xmath0164 and pks 0735@xmath0178 showed no significant trend either way , and only oj 287 showed a weak redder - when - brighter correlation .",
    "more importantly , our results add quite a bit of evidence in favour of the hint of a redder - when - brighter trend for fsrqs ( gu et al .",
    "2006 ; osterman meyer et al .",
    "four of the six fsrqs in our sample , pks 0420@xmath1014 , 4c 29.45 , pks 1510@xmath1089 and 3c 454.3 all show that trend .",
    "the special object 3c 273 had similar negative correlations for two colour - indices but a positive one for the other ; only 3c 279 among the fsrqs showed a clear bluer - when - brighter trend , and it was one of the two objects for which we lacked b band data .",
    "this possibility that the colour index variations with brightness typically follow different trends in fsrqs and bl lacs is intriguing .",
    "if a general result , it would indicate that the physical conditions are different in the two types of blazars in some important way .",
    "this perhaps would not be too surprising , in that most bl lacs are believed to be beamed , but intrinsically weak , fr i radio galaxies ( e.g. , padovani & urry 1992 ) , while the parent population of the fsrqs are the more powerful fr ii radio galaxies ( e.g. , maraschi & rovetti 1994 ) . on the other hand , the hypothesis that fr ii and fr i radio galaxies have fundamentally similar engines and that the difference between them arises merely from difference in their jet powers and the gases through which they flow on the kpc - scale ( e.g. , bicknell 1994 ; maraschi & rovetti 1994 ) is well supported , particularly by the existence of hymors  hybrid morphology radio sources , in which one side of the source has an fr i morphology , while the other shows a clear fr ii structure ( e.g. , gopal - krishna & wiita 2000 ) .",
    "still , there do seem to be some differences in the nuclear uv properties of the two classes ( e.g. , chiaberge et al .",
    "2002 ) so this dichotomy is not completely clear .",
    "so it is very important to investigate whether the claim that the bl lacs and fsrqs follow different trends for colour index against brightness is correct . while the preponderance of data , both in bl lacs and fsrqs , is with these opposite trends the numbers are small and exceptions are present in both groups .",
    "all the optical observations of the source bl lac shows that it follows a bluer - when - brighter trend and our observations also revealed the same trend .",
    "a similar trend has also been commonly observed in s5 0716@xmath0714 and oj 287 .",
    "our literature search shows the general steepening trend with increase in brightness of fsrqs in 3c 454.3 and pks 0420@xmath1014 which we have also found in our analysis results . in pks 0735@xmath0178 and",

    "both of them show a bluing trend with increase in flux although the correlation is weak in the case of pks 0735@xmath0178 .",
    "we stress that the amount of data for fsrqs is quite limited and additional observations could easily erase the nominal trend we find for redder - when - brighter behaviour among them .",
    "we suggest that both of these behaviours can be accommodated within shock - in - jet models .",
    "when an outgoing shock strikes a region with larger electron populations , stronger magnetic fields or a turbulent cell within the underlying flow , the emissivity from that region will rise .",
    "the radiation emitted at higher frequencies will typically emerge sooner while the maximum flux at somewhat lower frequencies will be seen later ( e.g. , valtaoja et al .",
    "2002 ) . therefore during the early phase of a rise in flux one is more likely to see a bluer colour .",
    "however , an observation later during the same flare might show a more enhanced redder band as the bluer one might have stopped rising as fast or may even have passed its peak .",
    "the former situation should be more likely to be seen than the latter , yielding a predominance of bluer - when - brighter situations , particularly when the jet is completely dominating the flux , as is the case for bl lacs . whereas for fsrqs there can be a significant disc component to the optical emission and this contribution is stronger toward the uv where the disc temperature peaks .",
    "then an increase in synchrotron emission from the jet , which usually peaks in the ir for lbls , would naturally yield a redder - when - brighter trend ( e.g. gu et al .",
    "our one counterexample among the fsrqs , 3c 279 , can sometimes have quite weak lines ; since we seem to have observed it in a low - state , it may well have been in that circumstance .",
    "then it could easily have been disc dominated , and thus shown a bluer - when - brighter trend , though it might behave in the opposite manner in a phase when its jet component is stronger ( e.g. , pian et al .",
    "we have carried out multiband optical photometry of a sample of 12 lbls during 2008 september through 2009 june .",
    "the results of our study can be summarized as follows : + 1 ) all sources except 3c 273 showed strong flux variations on timescales of months , as expected .",
    "the amplitude of variation was @xmath20.3 mag in pks 0420@xmath1014 , bl lac and pks 0735@xmath0178 , while for ao 0235@xmath0164 and s5 0716@xmath0714 the variability amplitude we saw exceeded 2 magnitudes . for the remaining eight blazars the amplitude of variability exceeded 0.9 magnitudes .",
    "+ 2 ) we found strong stcv in at least one colour index for 8 of the 12 sources , with 3c 66a , oj 287 , 3c 273 and bl lac as the exceptions , but only 4 showed it in all 4 bands .",
    "+ 3 ) the duty cycles for flux and colour variations on stv timescales in lbls are @xmath292 per cent and @xmath233 per cent , respectively .",
    "+ 4 ) three out of six bl lacs followed the bluer - when - brighter trend that had been rather well established in earlier studies ; ao 0235 + 164 was achromatic ; however , both oj 287 and pks 0735@xmath0178 were redder - when - brighter .",
    "5 ) four of the six fsrqs showed the opposite , redder - when - brighter , trend , which had been suggested earlier .",
    "two colour indices went in this direction for 3c 273 but one went the other way ; the only clear violator of this trend was 3c 279 .",
    "our new data substantially increases the evidence in favour of this proposition , but by no means establish it .",
    "substantial additional multi - colour observations of this class of blazars would be needed to do so and they are on our agenda .",

    "<S> we have measured multi - band optical flux and colour variations for a sample of 12 low energy peaked blazars on short , day - to - month , timescales . </S>",
    "<S> our sample contains six bl lacertae objects and six flat spectrum radio quasars . </S>",
    "<S> these photometric observations , made during september 2008 to june 2009 , used five optical telescopes , one in india and four in bulgaria . </S>",
    "<S> we detected short term flux variations in eleven of these blazars and colour variability in eight of them . </S>",
    "<S> our data indicate that six blazars ( 3c 66a , ao 0235@xmath0164 , s5 0716@xmath0714 , pks 0735@xmath0178 , oj 287 and 3c 454.3 ) were observed in pre- or post - outburst states , that five ( pks 0420@xmath1014 , 4c 29.45 , 3c 279 , pks 1510@xmath1089 and bl lac ) were in a low state , while one ( 3c 273 ) was in an essentially steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the duty cycles for flux and colour variations on short timescales in these low energy peaked blazars are @xmath292 per cent and @xmath2 33 per cent , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the colour vs magnitude correlations seen here support the hypothesis that bl lac objects tend to become bluer with increase in brightness ; however , flat spectrum radio quasars may show the opposite trend , and there are exceptions to these trends in both categories of blazar . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss emission models for active galactic nuclei that might explain our results .    </S>",
