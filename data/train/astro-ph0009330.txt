    "a popular explanation for exponential stellar light profiles of both high and low surface brightness disk galaxies is that stars form _ in situ _ in an already exponential gaseous disk ( mo , mao & white 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the origin of the exponential gaseous disk is in turn explained by the idea that all gas destined to settle into the disk originated in a rigidly rotating spherical protocloud which conserved its specific angular momentum not only during the process of protogalactic collapse and settling into centrifugal equilibrium but also throughout the star formation process ( mestel 1963 ; gunn 1982 ) . given the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation which makes such idealized conditions unlikely , a more appealing idea is that stars acquire an exponential stellar profile , regardless of initial conditions prior to star formation , if star formation proceeds on a viscous timescale ( silk & norman 1981 ; lin & pringle 1987 ) .",
    "we extend analytical work done by previous authors by performing numerical hydrodynamical simulations with the bgk ( bhatnagar - gross - krook ) code ( prendergast & xu 1993 ; slyz & prendergast 1999 ) . because this code solves a model to the collisional boltzmann equation",
    ", it incorporates dissipation naturally .",
    "our simulations start with a gaseous disk of arbitrary initial density profile in inviscid centrifugal equilibrium in a static dark matter halo also of arbitrary profile . on a 201 by 201 evenly spaced cartesian grid ,",
    "we follow the evolution of disks with milky way type masses and sizes for about 12 gyr .",
    "we assume an isothermal equation of state and we neglect self - gravity and stellar feedback in this contribution .",
    "for different initial gas and dark matter profiles we obtain disks with approximately exponential stellar profiles as long as @xmath0 ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we find that the stellar exponential scalelength is approximately half the initial half mass radius for the gas .",
    "hence in so far as the disks all end up with exponential stellar profiles , they forget their initial conditions but the exponential scalelength remembers the degree of central concentration of the initial gas distribution .",
    "in addition to obtaining exponential stellar profiles , we also find gas and star fractions after @xmath1 12 gyr that are consistent with observations without having to invoke an efficiency parameter for star formation .",
    "the exact link between star formation and viscosity remains a question .",
    "however our results suggest that the viscous timescale is indeed the natural timescale for star formation .",
