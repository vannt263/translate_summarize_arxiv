    "heavy quarks , unlikely light quarks do not come to an equilibrium with the surrounding matter and may therefore play an important role in the search for properties of this matter .",
    "produced in hard collisions , their initial momentum can be inferred from pp collisions . the deviation of the measured heavy mesons @xmath9 distribution in @xmath10 collisions from that measured in pp collisions is usually quantified by the nuclear modification factor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the differential electrons yield from heavy meson decays in @xmath13 collisions and @xmath14 is corresponding cross section in @xmath15 collisions in any given @xmath9 bin .    in the rhic experiments the heavy mesons have not yet been directly measured .",
    "both the phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite collaboration have observed only single nonphotonic electrons , which have been created in the semileptonic decay of heavy mesons .",
    "thus experimentally it is not easy separate between charm and bottom hadrons .",
    "the qcd calculations in the fixed order + next to leading logarithm ( fonll ) predict  @xcite the theoretical uncertainty for the charm and bottom quarks @xmath9 distribution in @xmath16-collisions at @xmath17 gev . apparently , that above @xmath18 gev / c the electrons from bottom mesons dominate the spectrum .",
    "however , uncertainty here is considerable .",
    "the nonphotonic electron yield at rhic measurement exhibits unexpectedly large suppression in central @xmath2 collisions at high @xmath9 .",
    "the observed values @xmath19 are smaller than originally expected .",
    "the theoretical approaches based on perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculation give much larger values and it has been doubt , whether pqcd is the right description of this interaction .",
    "one should note that for light quarks the radiative energy loss is the most important .",
    "the heavy quarks have a smaller amount of radiative energy loss due to their large mass  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic freedom in qcd enable one to apply the standard perturbative formulas at large momenta transferred .",
    "however a number of phenomena are beyond such calculation .",
    "moreover , the perturbative theory contain unphysical singularities in the expression for the running coupling , for example the ghost poles and also the unphysical cutes .",
    "therefore by number of authors were considered the analytic models of invariant charge in qcd .",
    "the condition of analyticity follows from the general principles of local quantum field theory .",
    "the analytic models contain no unphysical singularities and running coupling may be determined in the spacelike ( euclidean ) region and in the timelike region by analytic continuation from spacelike region . in this work",
    "we investigate the collisional energy losses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark in quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in central @xmath13 collisions at rhic energy .",
    "we use here the formulas for analytic invariant charge in qcd in the spacelike region .",
    "we show that the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 observed in the experiments is determined by hard collisions with qcd analytic charge @xmath20 which have the landau pole at @xmath21 in the perturbative qcd , but have no of this pole in analytic qcd .",
    "the vicinity @xmath22 one should consider as boundary of hard collisions in qcd .    in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] we give the brief description of analytic models results , which we use in this paper , and corresponding reference .    in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] we give the brief description of effective quasiparticle model and physical characteristic of expanding plasma .",
    "we calculate here energy losses @xmath23 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks at collisions with gluons and light quarks in plasma , using the analytic coupling in qcd .",
    "we calculate also the summary losses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks for various energies while they transverse the expanding plasma .    in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] we calculate the common nuclear modification factor @xmath6 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks , which fragmentized into @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons .",

    "the effective coupling constant @xmath24 is given in the lowest approximation ( one loop ) by the famous asymptotic formulas @xmath25 where @xmath26 is dimensional constant of qcd .",
    "this coupling constant have divergence at @xmath27 .",
    "that is related to an infrared landau pole in the running coupling , that is nonperturbative issue . in the two - loop case",
    "we have besides pole also the unphysical cut owing to the factor of type @xmath28 . in consequence of these difficulties",
    "the number of authors use the analytic models of invariant charge in qcd .",

    "we describe here briefly the analytic model proposed in the works  @xcite ,  @xcite . here",
    "the solution is derived as the solution of the rg equation with the @xmath29 function `` improved '' by the analytization procedure .",
    "this correspond to demand of analyticity of right hand side of rg equations as a whole before their solution by use of the kllen - lehmann integral representation . at the @xmath30-loop",

    "the infrared enhancement at small @xmath40 is in agreement with the schwinger - dyson equations  @xcite .",
    "the analytic invariant charge ( aic ) at the higher loop levels was also investigated in the works  @xcite ,  @xcite on the basic of the kllen - lehmann type integral representation .",
    "it was shown that aic possesses the higher loop stability .",
    "i.e. the curves corresponding to the two and three - loop levels are almost indistinguishable . in the present work we use analytic invariant charge in the form  ( [ eq.4 ] ) for investigation of energy losses @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks at collisions with gluons and light quarks in the quark - gluon plasma produced in central @xmath13 collisions at rhic energy .",
    "by analogy with the works  @xcite ,  @xcite we use the effective quasiparticle model for calculation of physical characteristics of expanding plasma .",
    "we assume the hot glue production at the early stage .",
    "this is caused by the relatively large @xmath41 cross section in comparison with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ones  @xcite . in the work",
