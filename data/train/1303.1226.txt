    "we also removed sources that did not have a nir counterpart in the flamingos catalog . in our analysis of the x - ray properties , we found that the sources without a nir counterpart had an average hardness ratio consistent with extragalactic sources ( wang et al . , in preparation ) .      by analyzing the distributions of yso classes separately one",

    "the different yso classes represent different evolutionary stages , with class 0 and i sources representing the youngest sources still embedded in their envelopes , class ii sources are a later stage of sources still accreting material from their disks , and class iii sources are diskless pre - main sequence stars .",

    "the radius for the class ii to class iii ratio is larger because the magnitude cuts ( see next paragraph ) reduce the number of sources .",
    "the regions are sampled across the grid at intervals of one - third the region radius .",
    "the created ratio map provides a visual representation of age gradients and can then map the progression of star formation .    in order to compare class ii and class iii sources",
    "it is necessary to make sure the samples are uniform and unbiased @xcite .",
    "we first restrict the samples to sources which are detected in the flamingos _ jhk _ survey .",
    "we estimate the class ii sample is complete to @xmath32 and the class iii sample to be complete to @xmath33 .",
    "we use the h - band luminosity as the emission from disks at this wavelength is negligible .",
    "we de - redden our samples to a 2 myr isochrone @xcite and limit the samples to @xmath34 , making the samples complete to the same depth across the cloud .",

    "we binned the regions by extinction into 1 mag bins and calculated the weighted mean ratio in each bin .",
    "figure 6 presents a plot of extinction bin versus mean ratio of class ii to class iii sources .",
    "the figure shows that the ratio increases monotonically with extinction .",
    "the plot can be fitted with a shallow linear fit for a@xmath37 mag , and a steeper linear fit for a@xmath38 mag .",
    "thus , decreasing age is related to increasing extinction .",

    ", the class i/0 to class ii ratio also steeply increases with extinction .",
    "however , this ratio appears flat for the extinction range a@xmath40 = 817 mag . to investigate this",
    "further we look at the contributions to the graph from the main core and cluster pl07 separately ( fig .",
    "7 b & c ) .",
    "we find that for the main core of the cloud , where most of the star formation is taking place , the ratio has a positive monotonic relation with extinction .",
    "cluster pl07 region is different ; it appears to have a relatively flat relationship between ratio and extinction , with a possible increase at a@xmath40 = 78 mag .",
    "there is a small offset between the extinction peak and class i/0 density peak ; which suggests a recent expulsion of gas from the center of pl07 . for the cloud as a whole ,",
    "the mean ratios between the class i/0 and class ii sources have a small range ( 0.200.60 ) which may correspond to a narrow range of ages or perhaps evidence for continuous star formation .",
    "the relationships between the two ratios and extinction reveal a trend of decreasing age with increasing extinction .",
    "this implies that stars may be preferentially forming in the highest extinction parts of the molecular cloud .",
    "the class ii to class iii ratio map traces regions with estimated ages of 0.53 myr , and these regions are spatially coincident with extinction values of a@xmath40 = 418 mag . using the empirical relationship between disk fraction and cluster age , we can fit a power law relation to the class ii to class iii ratio and age .",
    "then we can directly study the relation between age and extinction .",
    "figure 8 shows a plot of estimated age versus extinction .",
    "the plot suggests that the column density of gas decrease exponentially with time above a@xmath40 = 5 mag , with a half - life , @xmath41 = 0.4 myr .",
    "we estimate the average rate at which the column density of gas decreases as @xmath42 which is over an order of magnitude larger than the star formation rate measured in nearby molecular clouds @xcite . thus most of this gas is not removed through formation of stars and is possibly being relocated to other regions of the cloud .",
    "this is consistent with the study of nearby molecular clouds by @xcite which demonstrated that star formation on the scale of few myr has a negligible effect on the total mass of the cloud .    in the rmc main core",
    ", we find a similar relationship between the class i/0 to class ii ratio and extinction .",
    "this suggests that star formation occurs preferentially in high extinction regions .",
    "additionally , we find that over half of the clustered ( @xmath43 ) class i/0 sources are found at @xmath44 mag and all of them at @xmath45 mag .",
    "this too is consistent with the study of nearby molecular clouds by @xcite that found an extinction threshold of @xmath46 mag , above which the star formation rate was proportional to the mass of the cloud measured above that threshold .",
    "the relationship between star formation and column density may have consequences for the formation and evolution of clusters .",
    "table 2 shows the properties and yso content of the clusters .",
    "the stellar content is measured within a 1 parsec ( 2.14 ) radius of the listed cluster center .",
    "most of the embedded clusters in the rmc have a class ii to class iii ratio , @xmath47 , between 1 and 2 . the weighted mean ratio of all the embedded clusters is @xmath48 , suggesting that most of the clusters started forming around the same time .    there is a group of clusters with ratios suggesting a more recent episode of star formation , having @xmath49 .",
    "this group includes clusters pl2a , pl02b , pl03b , and refl09 .",
    "these clusters however do not appear to have a significant class i/0 population .",
    "this suggests that the star formation in these clusters is more coeval .",
    "the cluster refl08 appears to have the most recent episode of star formation .",
    "this cluster has class i/0 sources concentrated in dense filamentary structures seen in extinction .",
    "it has the highest ratio of class ii to class iii sources which is consistent with an age less than 1 myr .",
    "our x - ray observations do not cover embedded cluster pl07 .",
    "this cluster has the second highest concentration of young class i/0 objects .",
    "however , without knowledge of its class iii content , an age estimate for this region is not possible .    although there are some differences between the clusters , the age spread of these clusters is nonetheless small .",

    "clusters pl02a and pl02b , spatially coincident with the visible edge of the region , have class ii to class iii ratios consistent with a recent ( @xmath6 1 myr ) episode of star formation .",
    "the formation of these clusters may have been triggered by ngc 2244 , consistent with the x - ray analysis of @xcite .",
    "our analysis finds a local age progression surrounding refl08 which is consistent with the studies of @xcite .",
    "this progression does not extend through the cloud .",
    "it appears that any effect the region has on the star formation history is secondary to that of the primordial collapse of the cloud .",
    "our analysis suggests that star formation started throughout the complex due to a primordial collapse and has progressed through a series of localized episodes of formation closely following each other .",
    "in our analysis of the different yso classes in the rmc we find that they often have different density distributions .",
    "we use the yso ratios to study age gradients across the cloud to better understand how star formation has progressed .",
    "the relationships between the yso ratios and extinction suggest that star formation in the cloud occurs preferentially in high extinction regions and that the column density of gas rapidly decreases as the region evolves .",
    "this suggests rapid removal of gas may account for the low star formation efficiencies observed in molecular clouds .",
    "we find that progressions of star formation appear to be localized with a small overall age spread across the cloud , consistent with star formation starting across the cloud at roughly the same time .",
    "the distribution of ysos in the rmc show little or no effect of ngc 2244 on the relative ages of the clusters except for the possible triggering of clusters pl02a and pl02b .",
