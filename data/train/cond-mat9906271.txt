    "aqueous solutions containing polymers and smaller solute molecules are common in biological systems and industrial applications . in",
    "many cases the small molecules are amphiphilic ( surfactants ) and may self - assemble with the polymer chains into joint aggregates .",
    "such systems , synthetic as well as biological , have been the subject of extensive research in the past few decades.@xcite the possibility to achieve polymer ",
    "surfactant aggregation using very low surfactant concentration offers a delicate control over the properties of the solution , a feature being used in numerous applications.@xcite    the current article presents a theory for the onset of self - assembly in such mixed systems.@xcite the theory considers the various interactions in a very general way , not taking into account microscopic details of the small molecules or the polymer .",
    "indeed , the particular structure of a surfactant may affect the details of its aggregation . nevertheless , we suggest that the _ onset _ of joint polymer  surfactant self - assembly is mainly determined by simpler , more general considerations .",
    "self - assembly of polymer  surfactant complexes usually starts at a well - defined surfactant concentration , the ` critical aggregation concentration ' ( _ cac _ ) .",
    "one of the most consistent experimental observations in polymer  surfactant systems is that the _ cac _ is found to be lower than the ` critical micelle concentration ' ( _ cmc _ ) of the polymer - free surfactant solution , @xmath0 consequently , polymer  surfactant systems are commonly divided into two categories : ( i ) systems whose _ cac _ is much lower than the _ cmc _ , @xmath1 ; ( ii ) systems where the _ cac _ is lower than , but comparable to the _ cmc _ , @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally , the former case corresponds to systems containing a polyelectrolyte and an oppositely charged ionic surfactant,@xcite _ e.g. , _",
    "polyacrylic acid ( paa ) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide ( dtab ) .",
    "the strong electrostatic attraction between the two species can cause the _ cac _ in such systems to be several orders of magnitude lower than the _",
    "cmc_. the latter case usually corresponds to systems containing a neutral polymer and an ionic surfactant,@xcite _ e.g. , _ polyethylene oxide ( peo ) and sodium dodecylsulfate ( sds ) .",
    "somewhat less common are systems containing a polyelectrolyte and a nonionic surfactant,@xcite which can be included in the second category as their _ cac _ is comparable to the _",
    "cmc_. systems where both species are neutral exhibit a very weak effect.@xcite    the _ cac _ is usually interpreted in terms of the strength of interaction , or affinity , between the two species . in analogy to regular micellization,@xcite @xmath3",
    "is related to the free energy of transfer ( in units of @xmath4 ) of a molecule from the aqueous solution to a joint aggregate .",
    "evidently , the affinity should be much stronger for oppositely charged species ( the first category above ) than for the other cases , resulting in a very low _ cac _ in those systems .",
    "the difficulty , however , is to correctly identify the various contributions to this free energy .",
    "apart from the bare interactions among the various molecules , there may be additional contributions from conformational changes of the polymer induced by the joint self - assembly . therefore , construction of a detailed , reliable molecular model for this complex system is a complicated task .",
    "several theories have been presented for polymer ",
    "surfactant aggregation.@xcite most of the models @xcite attempt to add the polymer as another ingredient to the already - established thermodynamic theory of micellization.@xcite these models are usually applied to the case of neutral polymers .",
    "the prediction of @xmath5 does not arise naturally from the models but depends on the choice of parameters .",
    "other models,@xcite inspired by the zimm - bragg theory of coil ",
    "helix transition,@xcite treat the bound surfactant as an adsorbed one - dimensional lattice gas . using two fitting parameters , for the affinity between the two species and for ` binding cooperativity '",
    ", they account for binding isotherms in polyelectrolyte ",
    "oppositely charged surfactant solutions .",
    "additional models for polyelectrolyte ",
    "ionic surfactant systems attempt to calculate the interaction between the two species focusing on electrostatics @xcite and counterion - condensation effects.@xcite    the models mentioned above do not explicitly consider internal features of the polymer chain .",
    "this approach may be justified for rigid polymers such as dna or strong polyelectrolytes at low ionic strength , where electrostatic interactions are not screened .",
    "it is somewhat more questionable in view of the strong conformational changes observed in flexible polymers upon self - assembly.@xcite in fact , most models use various interaction parameters to fit experimental data , which may implicitly contain conformational effects ( _ e.g. , _ the cooperativity parameter in one - dimensional models , whose physical origin is unspecified @xcite ) .",
    "two recent works @xcite have treated the polymer chains in more detail , but in a different context .",
    "both assume that spherical surfactant micelles have already bound to the polymer and try to study the additional effect of the adsorbed chain . in another work @xcite a detailed molecular thermodynamic theory of polymer ",
    "surfactant complexes was presented .",
    "this model applies to neutral polymers and contains several molecular parameters .",
    "the present work takes a different approach towards the joint self - assembly of polymers and small solute molecules such as surfactants . instead of starting from a model of surfactant micellization and trying to add the polymer as a further complication",
    ", we rather focus on flexible polymers in solution and study the effect of small associating molecules , treated as impurities , on the chain statistics . unlike surfactant micelles ,",
    "a flexible polymer can be treated as a thermodynamic , large system .",
    "hence , if the polymer undergoes a significant change of conformation at the onset of self - assembly , then a simple phenomenological approach might be more successful than in pure surfactant solutions .",
    "we thus conjecture that in a mixed system of flexible polymers and small molecules the _ cac _ is associated with a local instability ( partial collapse ) of the polymer chain .",
    "the instability occurs when attractive correlations induced by the interaction between the species overcome the intrinsic intra - chain repulsion .",
    "this description is reminiscent of de gennes and brochard s treatment of a polymer in a binary mixture of good solvents close to the demixing critical point.@xcite similar to the latter scenario , the polymer studied in the current work is predicted to undergo _ partial collapse _",
    "@xcite at the _ cac _ , which marks the onset of association .",
    "the simple criterion of partial collapse leads to several interesting predictions which seem to be well supported by experiments .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to distinguish and explain certain common , ` universal ' features in the vast experimental literature which has accumulated on polymer  surfactant systems .",
    "the theory presented here is phenomenological in nature and does not consider molecular or structural details .",
    "hence , on one hand , its results are fairly general , relying on a single requirement  that the polymer be flexible enough for its local conformation to play a significant role in the self - assembly .",
    "( this assumption is quantified in section  [ sec_blob ] . ) unlike detailed molecular models,@xcite the number of parameters is reduced to three : one accounting for the affinity between the two species ( @xmath6 ) , another for intra - chain repulsion ( @xmath7 ) , and the third is the _ cmc _ of the polymer - free solution , ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the theory is restricted to the onset of association ( _ cac _ ) and its vicinity .",
    "since we are not interested in the micellization itself , we treat the surfactant solution , as it approaches the _ cmc _ , as a dilute solution of small associating molecules approaching phase separation .",
    "the theory can not provide , therefore , a reliable detailed description of aggregation .",
    "more molecular approaches can be found in refs  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that models of a simpler , more general nature were successfully employed in the past for describing the interaction of polymers with surfactant monolayers.@xcite    the free energy of the polymer solution is assumed to be characterized by a single interaction parameter ( 2nd virial coefficient ) .",
    "the theory is thus applicable to a dilute as well as semi - dilute polymer regime .",
    "issues of morphology , phase behavior and rheology , especially in semi - dilute and concentrated polymer  surfactant systems , are very interesting and important,@xcite but lie outside the scope of the current work .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section  [ sec_cac ] a simple thermodynamic model for the onset of self - assembly in the mixed system",
    "is presented .",
    "the main results of this model , as given in section [ sec_cac_results ] , can be divided into two limiting cases , corresponding to strong or weak effective interaction between the two species . in section  [ sec_blob ]",
    "we present a more refined model , using a scaling approach to treat the partial collapse of the polymer in more detail .",
    "we qualitatively discuss in section [ sec_polysoap ] the special case of amphiphilic polymers and polysoaps , which provides experimental support for our assumptions .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_summary ] we present some conclusions and future directions . throughout the paper",
    "we compare our results with available experiments whenever possible , and stress points where experimental support is still required . in order to make the central results as clear as possible ,",
    "we have put most of the technical calculations in two appendices . appendix",
    "a contains a detailed statistical - mechanical calculation , which is used to verify the general results of section [ sec_cac ] while allowing for their systematic improvement .",
    "appendix b presents the details of the scaling calculation leading to the results of section [ sec_blob ] .",
    "consider a solution of polymer and smaller solute molecules whose local concentrations are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the free energy density can be divided into three terms accounting for the polymer contribution , the small solute one , and the coupling between the two , @xmath11 ( all energies are expressed hereafter in units of the thermal energy @xmath12 , _",
    "@xmath13 has the dimensions of inverse volume . )",
    "we treat the repulsion between monomers of the chains using a 2nd - virial term , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the free energy of an ideal polymer solution and @xmath16 is the 2nd virial coefficient ( having dimensions of volume ) .",
    "this treatment is valid for dilute , as well as semi - dilute polymer solutions . since the concentration of both species is low and we are interested only in the onset of association , the leading quadratic term in the expansion of @xmath17 suffices , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a parameter characterizing the interaction strength and having dimensions of volume .",
    "in fact , as will be shown below , this general model is sufficient for obtaining our main qualitative results .",
    "however , for the sake of clarity , let us specify an expression for the small solute contribution as well : @xmath20 the first term in this expression accounts for the ideal entropy of mixing of the small molecules , the second describes short - range attraction , and the third is due to a contact with a reservoir of small molecules having a chemical potential @xmath21 .    in the absence of polymer",
    "the small solute concentration has a bulk value , @xmath22 , corresponding to the minimum of @xmath23 .",
    "consider a small perturbation in local concentration , @xmath24 .",
    "assuming that the solution is both below its _ cac _ and _ cmc _ , @xmath13 can be expanded in small @xmath25 to yield @xmath26 where @xmath27 . in this work",
    "we identify the _ cmc _ as the value of @xmath10 at which , for @xmath28 , the solution becomes unstable to small perturbations , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath29 equation [ cmc ] is essentially a ( spinodal ) phase separation condition . in practice , due to the particular structure of surfactants and the resulting finite - size effects , the _ cmc _ does not correspond to a true phase transition , and @xmath30 is not strictly zero . in the case of aggregation into finite micelles of typical aggregation number @xmath31 , a rough estimate for @xmath32",
    "is given by @xmath33 , the volume - fraction ratio of single molecules and molecules participating in aggregates .",
    "this gives @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the energy per molecule ( in units of @xmath12 ) gained by aggregation.@xcite for typical values of @xmath36 and @xmath35 of a few @xmath12 , this is a small , yet finite number .",
    "since we are interested in the onset of the joint self - assembly ( which is subsequently found to occur at a lower concentration than the polymer - free surfactant micellization ) , we allow ourselves to ignore these delicate considerations . using eq  [ cmc ] , we thus assume that for @xmath37 specific features of the surfactant can be incorporated in the phenomenological parameter @xmath8 . in the presence of the polymer , minimization of eq  [ perturbed_f ] with respect to @xmath25",
    "gives @xmath38 the last term in @xmath13 implies an effective reduction in the 2nd virial coefficient of the polymer , @xmath39 thus , letting the distribution of small molecules , @xmath10 , reach equilibrium has led to an effective attraction between chain monomers.@xcite    the polymer will become unstable when @xmath40 . at this point @xmath9",
    "is expected to increase significantly ( due to contraction of chain conformation ) , leading to a sharp increase in @xmath25 as well .",
    "we identify this point , therefore , as the _ cac_. setting @xmath40 in eq  [ veff ] and using eq  [ f_s ] for @xmath23 , we find the following expression for the _ cac _ : @xmath41 this simple calculation demonstrates the physics governing the mixed system : the affinity between the flexible polymer and the small solute induces attractive correlations between monomers , which compete with the bare monomer - monomer repulsion .",
    "the correlations become stronger as the _ cmc _ is approached , and _ they are bound to win before reaching the cmc , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath5_. the fact that the _ cac _ is lower than the _ cmc _ has been established by numerous experiments.@xcite according to the description given here , this fact is a manifestation of a general effect of equilibrated ( annealed ) impurities .",
    "it is important to note that the qualitative features of expression [ cac ] , relating the _ cac _ and _ cmc _ , do not depend on the specific model taken for the small molecules , _",
    "i.e. , _ the expression for @xmath23 . in appendix",
    "a we present a more detailed statistical - mechanical calculation , yielding eq  [ cac ] as a first order in an expansion .",
    "going beyond this first , mean - field approximation gives the same qualitative relation between @xmath42 and @xmath8 as in eq  [ cac ] , with merely a modified function @xmath43 .",
    "this modified function can be written in a close form using the inverse function @xmath44 of @xmath45 : @xmath46 both expressions for @xmath47 , eqs [ cac ] and [ f_beyond ] , have the same limiting behavior , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath48 for small @xmath49 and @xmath50 for large @xmath49 .",
    "the two expressions differ , however , in higher orders .",
    "the difference is particularly significant in the asymptotic approach towards saturation ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the mean - field calculation gives a @xmath52 dependence , whereas the improved analysis yields a much slower trend towards saturation of @xmath53 .",
    "the difference is also evident in figure  [ fig_f ] , which shows the two results for @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , large values of the argument @xmath49 correspond to solute concentrations approaching the _ cmc _ , @xmath54 , where solute - solute correlations become strong and the mean - field approximation should give poor results .",
    "in fact , the leading asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath43 , relating the _ cac _ and _ cmc _ , can be obtained on very general grounds , without specifying an expression for @xmath23 . to this end",
    "we use the following mathematical construction .",
    "( the uninterested reader can skip the following derivation and just recall the general result , eq  [ cac_general ] . )",
    "let @xmath43 be a dimensionless function , such that @xmath55 solves the equation @xmath56 .",
    "( @xmath49 is now merely an unspecified argument . ) according to eq  [ cmc ] , for @xmath57 the solution to the equation is @xmath58 .",
    "hence we get the asymptotic behavior for small arguments , @xmath59 . in the other limit one has @xmath60 and @xmath61 . since @xmath62 is a well - behaved function for @xmath63 , the solution for @xmath10 must tend to zero .",
    "hence @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , in this limit the solution @xmath65 must become independent of the fixed parameter @xmath8 , which leads to the asymptotic behavior @xmath66 .",
    "the general expression for the _ cac _ is thus @xmath67      the argument @xmath68 in eq  [ cac_general ] determines the strength of effective interaction between the polymer and the small molecules .",
    "two limiting cases arise : ( i ) strong effective interaction ( @xmath69 ) , where @xmath1 ; ( ii ) weak interaction ( @xmath51 ) , where @xmath2 . the two limiting behaviors , together with a third one corresponding to polysoaps ( section  [ sec_polysoap ] ) , are presented in the diagram of figure  [ fig_diag ] .",
    "note that the distinction between strong and weak interaction involves not only the bare interaction between the species , as compared to the interaction among small molecules , but also intra - chain features . in our opinion ,",
    "this observation was not given proper attention by previous studies .",
    "in the case of strong effective interaction between the two species , @xmath70 ( upper part of the diagram in figure  [ fig_diag ] ) , the attraction among the small molecules has no effect on the _ cac _ and , according to eq  [ cac_general ] , it becomes independent of the _ cmc _ , @xmath71 in practice , this case corresponds to systems containing oppositely charged species , _",
    "e.g. , _ a polyacid and a cationic surfactant.@xcite because of the strong electrostatic interactions , the _ cac _ in such systems is usually found to be two to three orders of magnitude lower than the _",
    "cmc_. in order for the requirement of polymer flexibility to be fulfilled , the system must contain additional salt which would screen the electrostatic interactions on length scales comparable to those of the induced attractive correlations .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath6 are expected to be dominated in such systems by electrostatics , and , therefore , mainly depend on the polymer ionization degree , @xmath72 , and salt concentration , @xmath73 .",
    "a polyelectrolyte solution is a complicated system by itself , exhibiting diverse behavior as function of @xmath72 and @xmath73.@xcite however , two observations can generally be made : ( i ) the monomer ",
    "monomer parameter , @xmath7 , should have a stronger dependence on @xmath72 than the monomer  small solute one , @xmath6 ( the simplest dependence would be @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) ; ( ii ) both @xmath7 and @xmath6 should have a similar ( increasing ) dependence on the debye screening length , @xmath76 , _",
    "i.e. , _ a similar decreasing dependence on @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , @xmath77 should increase with @xmath73 and , somewhat more surprisingly , be only weakly dependent on @xmath72 .",
    "a model which is focused on the bare interaction between the species would necessarily yield a _ strongly decreasing _ dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath72 .",
    "the weak dependence on @xmath72 is a characteristic result of our approach , which takes into account intra - chain features .",
    "it stems from a competition between two effects that compensate each other : a mutual affinity effect ( increasing @xmath72 strengthens the attraction between the oppositely charged species ) , and an intra - chain effect ( larger @xmath72 implies stronger intra - chain repulsion).@xcite    apart from these rather general conclusions , we may try to reach more quantitative predictions.@xcite the excluded - volume parameter for a flexible ( weak ) polyelectrolyte should roughly scale like @xmath78.@xcite ( this result can be simply interpreted as an electrostatic energy @xmath79 integrated over a volume @xmath80 . ) similarly , we write for the monomer  small solute parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting _ cac _ should scale , therefore , as @xmath82 a more detailed calculation , however , yields a different scaling and is discussed in section  [ sec_blob ] ( eq  [ cac_scaling_blob ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab_i ] summarizes various experimental results for the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath72 in the presence of salt .",
    "the first six experimental systems presented in the table exhibit vanishing dependence on @xmath72 , the next four  an increasing dependence , and the last one  a weak decrease .",
    "the fact that most experiments found a vanishing or slightly _ increasing _ dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath72 clearly indicates the important role of intra - chain features in the self - assembly .",
    "if intra - chain features are disregarded , one would expect , upon increasing @xmath72 , a stronger attraction between the oppositely charged species and , hence , a sharp _ decrease _ in the _ cac _ , _ i.e. , _ an opposite trend to the one observed in table  [ tab_i ] .    as mentioned above",
    ", the solution must contain enough salt for our description to hold .",
    "electrostatic interactions should be screened on length scales comparable to the correlation length in the surfactant solution , _",
    "i.e. , _ the debye screening length , @xmath83 , should be smaller than a few nanometers . for monovalent salt ,",
    "it means that the salt concentration should exceed about 10 mm .",
    "this might explain the inconsistent trends observed in systems containing only about this amount of salt ( table  [ tab_i ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_salt ] shows experimental results for the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath73 , taken from eleven different experiments with different mixtures of polymers , surfactants and mono - valent salts .",
    "all systems exhibit an increasing dependence on @xmath73 , in qualitative agreement with our finding .",
    "previous works focused on small differences in the slopes of @xmath3 _",
    "vs_.  @xmath84 for different systems , attributing them to different ionization degrees of the charged aggregates.@xcite while such effects are probably present , we would rather like to draw the attention to the striking _",
    "uniformity _ of the slopes  all of the graphs in figure  [ fig_salt ] , representing eleven different polymer  surfactant systems , have fitted slopes in the narrow range of 0.680.77 , namely @xmath85 with @xmath860.680.77.@xcite this uniformity was not pointed out before .",
    "it might indicate that specific molecular details are not essential to determining the onset of self - assembly , as suggested here .",
    "quantitatively , the observed power law disagrees with the exponent @xmath87 in eq  [ cac_scaling_strong ] .",
    "we return to this point in section  [ sec_blob ] .",
    "it is important to note again that our results hold for flexible polymers only .",
    "a different behavior as function of @xmath73 is observed for stiff polymers such as dna or proteins.@xcite similarly , the _ cac _ in salt - free solutions of strongly charged polyelectrolytes , which can not be regarded as flexible chains , depends sensitively on @xmath72.@xcite      in the other limiting case of eq  [ cac_general ] , @xmath88 ( lower part of the diagram in figure  [ fig_diag ] ) , the effective interaction between the polymer and small molecules is weak and the _ cac _ and _ cmc _ become comparable ( yet still @xmath5 ) , @xmath89 where @xmath90\\lesssim 1 $ ] can be considered essentially as a prefactor which is not very sensitive to changes in @xmath7 , @xmath6 or @xmath8 [ since @xmath47 is close to saturation ; cf .",
    "eq  [ cac_general ] ] .",
    "experimentally , this weak - interaction limit applies to systems where at least one of the species is uncharged , _",
    "neutral polymers interacting with ionic surfactants @xcite or polyelectrolytes interacting with nonionic surfactants.@xcite the _ cac _ is expected to depend in this case on molecular details .",
    "however , _ most of this complicated dependence is incorporated in @xmath8 itself_. in other words , changing various parameters ( _ e.g. , _ ionic strength ) may lead to considerable changes in both the _ cmc _ and _ cac _ ; yet , according to eq  [ cac_weak ] , their ratio is expected to remain roughly constant .",
    "we note again that the model is not presumed to properly account for the _ cmc _ itself .",
    "it is expected , however , to correctly capture the relation between the _ cac _ and _ cmc _ , due to the particular behavior of the polymer at the _",
    "cac_.    the simple prediction given in eq  [ cac_weak ] is verified in various experiments , as summarized in table  [ tab_weak ] . in each of the four experimental systems presented in table  [ tab_weak ] ,",
    "the ratio @xmath91 remains roughly constant , sometimes over a wide range of _ cmc _",
    "the treatment given in section  [ sec_cac ] for the onset of self - assembly is not accurate enough and should be regarded as a first step in a more rigorous calculation .",
    "its description of the _ cac _ resembles a ` shifted ' @xmath92 collapse  a sharp transition of polymer conformation occurring when the 2nd virial coefficient changes sign . in practice , however , flexible polymers do not exhibit a sharp coil - to - globule collapse at the _ cac_.",
    "their association with small surfactant molecules exhibits a steep , albeit continuous increase at the _ cac _ , the finite slope being associated with the ` binding cooperativity'.@xcite    the difference between a @xmath92 point and the _ cac _ lies in the different ranges of competing interactions . in a regular @xmath92 point the competing interactions ( between monomers and between monomers and solvent molecules ) have a similar short range .",
    "this leads to a sharp conformational collapse which is stabilized by three - body interactions ( 3rd virial coefficient term ) . by contrast , in the system discussed here the strong , short - range repulsion between monomers is overcome by weaker , yet longer - range attractive correlations .",
    "these attractive correlations are induced by the small associating molecules interacting with the polymer , as has been found in section [ sec_cac ] . as a result of the competition between interactions of different ranges , the polymer undergoes a more moderate _ partial collapse _ into sub - units ( ` blobs ' ) , such that the interaction between monomers within each blob is dominated by the short - range repulsion , whereas the interaction between blobs is dominated by the attractive correlations .",
    "this behavior resembles the one previously discussed by de gennes and brochard for a polymer in a binary mixture close to the critical demixing point.@xcite an important difference , however , is that the correlation length in the system of ref  @xcite may become arbitrarily large .",
    "the solution discussed here , by contrast , is not close to a critical point but approaches a point of phase separation or micellization .",
    "thus , the correlations may become strong but their range remains finite .",
    "partial collapse is essentially a ` smoothed ' @xmath92 transition  the rescaled ` chain of blobs ' is at a @xmath92 point , while on length scales smaller than the blob size the chain is almost unperturbed . throughout the regime of partial collapse ,",
    "as small solute molecules are added , the sub - division of the chain into blobs is adapted so as to keep the rescaled chain at a @xmath92 point .",
    "association , thus , progresses _ continuously _ , as the blobs become smaller and more numerous , and the local monomer concentration gradually increases . in the following analysis , the added solute molecules ( _ e.g. , _",
    "surfactants ) do not appear explicitly .",
    "they are accounted for via the effective interaction which they induce in the polymer .",
    "this interaction has a typical amplitude , @xmath93 , and a typical range , @xmath94 , both of which implicitly depend on the solute concentration @xmath10 .",
    "since , for very long chains , @xmath94 is the only length scale in the problem , it must also be the typical size of a blob.@xcite    let us consider , therefore , a chain of blobs of size @xmath94 , each containing @xmath95 statistical ( kuhn ) segments , as sketched in figure  [ fig_blob].@xcite if each blob contains a large number of segments , its size @xmath94 is related to the number @xmath95 by a power law , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the length of a kuhn segment . in the case of excluded - volume repulsion in three dimensions , the flory argument yields @xmath98 and @xmath99.@xcite further properties of the ` chain of blobs ' can be studied using scaling arguments , as presented in detail in appendix  b. this calculation leads to the following relations between @xmath95 , @xmath94 and the phenomenological parameters introduced in section  [ sec_cac ] : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the effective reduction in the 2nd virial coefficient due to the added solute ( surfactant ) , defined in eq  [ veff ] .",
    "several interesting observations arise from eq  [ g_xi ] . in order for",
    "the results to be consistent , @xmath95 and @xmath94 must increase with decreasing @xmath101 so that the entire chain should reduce to a single blob for small enough @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the self - consistency condition is @xmath102 this self - consistency condition gives a precise definition for the requirement of polymer flexibility  on the scale of the correlation length in the solution the chain statistics should satisfy @xmath103 .",
    "( in particular , the chain should not be stretched , having @xmath104 . ) for example , in polyelectrolyte solutions this condition sets a lower bound for salt concentration , below which the chain would be too stretched on the length scale of @xmath94 , and the partial - collapse picture described here would become invalid .    repeating the calculation for chains embedded in @xmath105 dimensions , the same result as eq  [ g_xi ]",
    "is obtained , with @xmath106 .",
    "this self - consistency condition , @xmath107 , is similar to well known results for the critical behavior of disordered systems . for both equilibrated ( annealed ) and frozen ( quenched ) disorder",
    " fisher renormalization @xcite and the harris criterion,@xcite respectively  the critical behavior is affected by impurities if @xmath108 , _ i.e. , _ @xmath107 .",
    "thus , in a similar way , small solute molecules affect the conformational transition of a polymer if @xmath108.@xcite    we stress again that the solution discussed here is not close to a critical point and , hence , the correlations induced in the polymer may be strong but their range remains finite . as a result , the blobs can not be arbitrarily large , _",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath94 are bounded by certain maximum values , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath110 characterizes the range of correlations in the solution of small molecules ( surfactants ) , it can be estimated by the typical size of aggregates ( micelles ) formed at the _ cmc _ , _ i.e. , _ typically a few nm . the value of @xmath109 , in turn ,",

    "both vanishing and weakly increasing dependencies were observed experimentally ( table  [ tab_i ] ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec_cac ] , these findings qualitatively support our approach , emphasizing the significance of intra - chain interactions . in order to quantitatively determine the correct dependence on @xmath72 ,",
    "more experiments are needed , in particular at higher ionic strength .",

    "the dependence in eq  [ cac_scaling_blob ] agrees with the experimentally observed power laws ( figure  [ fig_salt ] ) , having exponents of @xmath86 0.680.77 .",
    "our basic conjecture , regarding instability of polymer conformation at the onset of self - assembly , can be qualitatively supported by considering a special class of polymers  associating polymers that form intra - chain aggregates in the absence of any additional associating solute . a good example for this case are amphiphilic side - chain polymers , which consist of a hydrophilic backbone ( usually a polyacid ) and many hydrophobic side chains.@xcite within a certain range of hydrophobicity , those polymers exhibit intra - chain aggregation while still remaining water - soluble , in which case they are called",
    "_ polysoaps_. by synthesizing polymers with various side - chain lengths and controlling their ionization degree , a crossover between regular polyelectrolyte behavior and intra - chain association ( polysoap ) can be observed.@xcite    according to our description , a polysoap is already partially collapsed .",
    "no further instability is supposed to occur upon addition of small solute molecules and , hence , no sharp onset of self - assembly is expected .",
    "association of small molecules to such a chain should progress gradually as function of concentration , by means of partitioning of molecules between the aqueous solution and the already - collapsed polymeric aggregates .",
    "the association of ionic surfactants with such hydrophobically modified polyelectrolytes , poly(maleic acid - co - alkylvinyl ether ) , was thoroughly studied.@xcite when the polymer is in the regular polyelectrolyte regime ( _ e.g. , _ having short side chains of 14 hydrocarbon groups ) , a sharp , cooperative binding is observed . on the other hand , when the polymer behaves as a polysoap ( having longer side chains and exhibiting intra - chain aggregation ) ,",
    "surfactant association is found to be gradual with no apparent _ cac_.@xcite we regard this experimental observation as a strong support for our conjecture , associating the _ cac _ with partial collapse .",
    "furthermore , let us consider amphiphilic polymers which still behave like polyelectrolytes but lie very close to the polysoap regime .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by tuning their ionization degree .",
    "the effective 2nd virial coefficient of such polymers should be small , leading , according to eq  [ cac_strong_blob ] ( or [ cac_strong ] ) , to low _",
    "cac_. the physical reason is that close to the polysoap regime the stability of the polymer is only marginal , _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath7 is close to zero even in the absence of additional solute ( surfactant ) .",
    "hence , a small amount of solute is sufficient to cause self - assembly . in this region of @xmath134",
    ", therefore , intra - chain features , rather than the affinity between the two species , determine the onset of self - assembly .",
    "as a result , the _ cac _ can be significantly reduced without a significant change in the bare interaction , or , moreover , even if the bare affinity becomes _ weaker _ ( _ e.g. , _ by reducing @xmath72 ) .",
    "there are two available experimental works demonstrating this surprising effect,@xcite as shown in figure  [ fig_amphi ] .",
    "both experiments involved amphiphilic polyelectrolytes whose charge density was varied .",
    "although reducing charge density must _ weaken _ the interaction with the oppositely charged surfactant , the _ cac _ was shown to _",
    "decrease _ , the effect becoming sharp close to the polysoap limit .",
    "the polymers discussed above have many hydrophobic groups along their backbone .",
    "also worth mentioning are experiments involving polyelectrolytes with a very small number of hydrophobic groups.@xcite in this case too , the _ cac _ was found to significantly decrease upon increasing the degree of hydrophobic modification , implying a sensitive dependence on intra - chain features .",
    "focusing on the onset of self - assembly ( the _ cac _ ) , we have presented a unified description of the interaction between a flexible polymer and small associating molecules in dilute solution . utilizing a conjecture of partial collapse of the polymer at the onset of self - assembly , we have obtained simple predictions which seem to be well supported by experiments on diverse polymer  surfactant systems .",
    "apart from the bare interaction between the two species , we argue that intra - chain interactions have an important role as well . in certain cases , such as systems involving amphiphilic polymers , intra - chain features",
    "may even become the dominant factor determining the _ cac_. the interplay between various interactions in the system ( monomer  solute , monomer  monomer and solute  solute ) leads to three self - assembly scenarios , which are summarized in the diagram of figure  [ fig_diag ] .",
    "by modifying intra - chain features of the polymer , one can obtain a crossover between the various self - assembly regimes without necessarily changing the bare interaction between the two associating species .",
    "an interesting experiment would be to take a weakly interacting system ( _ e.g. , _ a polyacid like paa and a nonionic surfactant like c@xmath135e@xmath136 ) and by modifying the polymer ( _ e.g. , _ changing hydrophobicity ) gradually shift it to the strong - interaction regime and finally to the polysoap regime ; the _ cac _ is predicted to decrease from a value close to the _ cmc _ to much lower values and finally to disappear .    in spite of the vast experimental literature available on polymer  surfactant systems ,",
    "additional experiments are still required in order to verify the theory presented in this work . in particular , measurement of polymer statistics at the _ cac _ ( _ i.e. , _ dependence of size on polymerization degree )",
    "may provide a clear verification of the partial - collapse conjecture .",
    "we have presented a scaling function relating the _ cac _ and _ cmc _ and demonstrated its universal features .",
    "the scaling function was explicitly calculated in a mean - field approximation and at the next level beyond mean field .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that we expect the scaling law of eqs [ cac_general ] and [ cac_blob ] to be of more general validity than any specific model discussed here .",
    "it should be interesting , therefore , to gain more information on the scaling law , _",
    "e.g. , _ by computer simulations , and check the analytic results .",
    "we have pointed at interesting similarities between the effect of small associating molecules on polymer conformation and general results concerning the effect of impurities on critical phenomena .",
    "one future extension of this work would be to apply the partial collapse approach to more concentrated solutions , where the onset of self - assembly involves many - chain effects and leads to interesting phase behavior and gelation.@xcite another direction may be to consider more complicated polymers such as polypeptides , where surfactant binding was shown to promote the formation of secondary structures.@xcite in addition , the partial - collapse approach is valid only for flexible polymers , as demonstrated in section  [ sec_blob ] .",
