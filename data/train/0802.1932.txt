    "understanding the interplay between electron - phonon ( e - ph ) and strong electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions can be important to understand the properties of many compounds , such as manganites@xcite or fullerides@xcite .",
    "this problem has recently received a renewed attention , after a number of experiments on high - t@xmath0 superconducting cuprates testified for a non trivial role of the e - ph coupling in the underdoped region , where correlation effects are important and standard e - ph theories are hardly reliable@xcite .",
    "indeed a full theoretical understanding of lattice effects in strongly - correlated systems is still lacking when the two interactions have intermediate or large strength .",
    "the essential features of a strongly - correlated system are captured in the celebrated hubbard model@xcite and in its extensions . on the other hand ,",
    "polaron formation due to e - ph coupling has been extensively studied in the absence of e - e repulsion , mainly in the limit of low electron density within the molecular - crystal model first introduced by holstein@xcite .",
    "nonperturbative approaches such as quantum monte carlo , density matrix renormalization group and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) have enormously contributed to the understanding of these models and have been successfully applied to the hubbard - holstein model@xcite .",
    "nonetheless these methods require a considerable numerical effort , and it is not unfair to say that approximate analytic results , even if less accurate , are still highly desirable .    from this point of view , variational approaches are a very natural choice as they provide immediate information on the ground - state properties . in the field of strongly - correlated systems ,",
    "the trial wavefunction introduced by gutzwiller@xcite and then generalized by bnemann and coworkers@xcite has proved quite accurate for electronic systems with local interactions .",
    "the underlying recipe is to construct the correlated wavefunction starting from an adequate uncorrelated one and projecting out the energetically unfavored states .",
    "the equivalence with the kotliar - ruckenstein ( kr ) slave - boson saddle - point solution@xcite allows also to go beyond the mean - field approximation in a controlled way . for the holstein model",
    "several trial wavefunctions have been proposed generalizing the lang - firsov transformation@xcite , which yields the exact solution in the atomic limit , and it is believed to capture the essence of polaronic physics , i.e. , the entanglement between electronic and phonic degrees of freedom . these kind of approaches have been successfully applied to the holstein model , mainly in the limit of low carrier density or for spinless electrons@xcite .",
    "in fact , a further complication arises at finite density , since the e - ph coupling induces an effective e - e attractive interaction that can not be handled in an independent particle picture .",
    "when the hubbard repulsion is included , it directly competes with such phonon - mediated attraction .",
    "the typical strategy to treat correlated fermions coupled with phonons consists in deriving an effective model for electrons by averaging the full hamiltonian over a suitable trial phonon wavefunction ( which also implies the neglect of any electron - multiphonon residual interaction)@xcite , and then to resort to some appropriate technique in order to tackle the electronic effective interaction .",
    "this can be done for instance by means of a hartree - fock decoupling scheme@xcite or exploiting the more accurate kr slave - boson mean field@xcite suitable for local e - e interactions . as discussed in details in refs .",
    "the assumption of a factorized wavefunction becomes questionable in the regime where retardation effects between the motion of electrons and lattice deformations imply a strong exchange of momentum .    in order to better describe the interplay between lattice vibrations and local electronic configurations",
    ", we introduced in a previous paper@xcite a gutzwiller phonon wavefunction ( gpw ) to account for the e - ph coupling besides strong electronic correlation and benchmarked it in the infinite-@xmath1 limit of the hubbard - holstein model by comparing with exact dmft calculations . in this limit",
    "a finite phonon - driven attraction is obviously ineffective against the infinite repulsion , and the only effect of phonons is the formation of polarons .    in this paper",
    "we turn our attention to the finite-@xmath1 regime , analyzing in details the paramagnetic solution ( i.e. , neglecting broken - symmetry phases ) . relaxing the infinite-@xmath1 assumption ,",
    "the competition between repulsion and attraction becomes effective , leading to a rich phase diagram .",
    "we focus on the half - filling case , in which the e - e and e - ph interactions can drive , respectively , the mott and bipolaronic metal - insulator transition , so that their interplay is both more transparent and more qualitative than for arbitrary fillings .",
    "out of half - filling the system is indeed always metallic in the absence of symmetry breaking , and the effect of the competition is essentially quantitative and therefore less clear@xcite .",
    "the key property of our gpw wavefunction is to treat simultaneously electrons and phonons from the onset by introducing a generalized gutzwiller projector where phonon quantum states are determined by the local electronic configurations rather than by the average electron density .",
    "this allows to address the modification induced by the electronic correlation onto the lattice groundstate .",
    "therefore , even if the multiphonon adiabatic regime of the weakly - correlated system is probably still misrepresented , we expect to capture the essential features of the model in the presence of a sizeable repulsive interaction , when the relevant physics is essentially local because the electron motion is slowed down by correlations .",
    "we derive a set of variational equations for the phonon wavefunctions and show that standard approaches can be obtained as particular choices for the solution of such equations .",
    "we obtain a phase diagram which strongly depends on the adiabaticity regime , and critically discuss our results and the quality of the proposed wavefunction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we introduce the model hamiltonian and the relevant equations for the general case of arbitrary electron filling , and then we specialize them for the half - filling case we are interested in . at the end of this section",
    "we derive standard variational approaches for the holstein problem as particular variational ansatzs on the gutzwiller wavefunction . in section [ sec : phasedia ] we present the general solution provided by our method for the half - filled system , whose properties are analyzed in the following section [ sec : polform ] .",
    "we then discuss in section [ sec : discussion ] the quality of the proposed wavefunction by comparing it with other variational wavefunctions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard - holstein model at half - filling reads : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively annihilation ( creation ) operators for tight - binding electrons with spin @xmath5 and for optical phonons of frequency @xmath6 on site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath1 the local hubbard repulsion and @xmath9 parameterizes the coupling between local displacements and electronic density fluctuations @xmath10 .",
    "both interaction terms have been written in a particle - hole symmetric form which enforces the half - filling condition .",
    "we introduce an adiabaticity parameter defined as @xmath11 , measuring the ratio between the phonon and electron characteristic energies , and a dimensionless parameter @xmath12 which measures the strength of the e - ph coupling . here",
    "@xmath13 is the half bandwidth , which depends on the hopping parameter @xmath8 once a particular lattice is chosen .",
    "we perform our calculations in an infinite - coordination bethe lattice with semicircular density of states of half - bandwidth @xmath14.@xcite for this lattice , as in any infinite - coordination lattice , the expectation value of the hamiltonian on the gutzwiller state can be performed without further approximations , because all the configurations with the same average occupation number equally contribute to the quantum averages .",
    "the same approach can be used also for finite - dimensional lattices , where it represents a further approximation , usually called gutzwiller approximation .",
    "another advantage of considering the infinite - coordination bethe lattice is the possibility to compare with the exact results for this lattice , obtained through dmft.@xcite    we introduce the gpw as@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a slater determinant , that we take as the non - interacting fermi sea in order to describe metallic states .",
    "@xmath17 is a generalized gutzwiller projection operator @xmath18 here @xmath19 are the projectors associated to the different local electronic states , empty site ( @xmath20 ) , singly occupied site ( @xmath21 ) and doubly occupied site ( @xmath22) .",
    "our wavefunction therefore associates to each local electronic state a normalized _ first quantization _ phonon wave function @xmath23 depending on the displacement coordinate @xmath24 , which has to be determined variationally , exactly like the probabilities of each of the local states @xmath25 ( @xmath26 are the same quantities for the uncorrelated system , _",

    ", one gets @xmath34 for the correlated occupation probabilities . setting @xmath35 ,",
    "the three amplitudes are controlled by a single variational parameter , @xmath36 .",

    "the second line of eq.([energy ] ) represents the standard energy of the gutzwiller approximation for the hubbard model with @xmath42 the free electron kinetic energy and @xmath43 the renormalization factor that accounts for the reduced electron mobility in the presence of e - ph and e - e interactions .",
    "then we have to minimize with respect to @xmath36 and the @xmath44 .",
    "the first minimization gives @xmath45 while the second yields the following non - linear second - order differential equations @xmath46 where the @xmath47 s are lagrange multipliers enforcing the normalization conditions on the @xmath48 s .    before discussing in some detail the solution of eqs.([mf_0])-([mf_2 ] ) , we briefly analyze their structure . in the absence of e - ph coupling they reduce to three equivalent schrdinger equations for a free harmonic oscillator centered at each site independent on the electron occupancy .",
    "therefore the phonon wavefunction is the standard gaussian , contributing @xmath49 to the on - site energy .",
    "switching on the e - ph interaction has two major effects .",
    "the first is to induce a shift proportional to @xmath50 to the phonon wavefunctions associated to the @xmath51 electron states , which is the expected effect in the atomic limit with the chosen form of the e - ph interaction ; the second is a non - local coupling between wavefunctions related to different charge configurations , which appears to be proportional to the average kinetic energy of the electrons .",
    "this is not surprising , since one expects the electron dynamics to affect the phononic properties driving them away from the atomic limit scenario .",
    "nonetheless , it is readily seen that this coupling term is inversely proportional to the adiabaticity ratio , that means , as it is well - known , that in the antiadiabatic regime , i.e. when phonons move faster than electrons , the interplay of phonon and electron dynamics is negligible : the lattice rearranges itself almost instantaneously with respect to slowly moving electrons and a charge - dependent shift of the phonons is sufficient to capture the ground - state properties of the system . on the other hand",
    "the coupling term becomes dominant in the opposite limit , i.e. for @xmath52 ; in this case each projected wavefunction depends heavily on the other wavefunctions and on the electron probability distribution , thus suggesting non trivial dependence on correlation effects .    at half - filling",
    "we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 , that imply @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the lowest - energy state .",
    "therefore we are left with two variational equations for the lattice ground state coupled with eq .",
    "( [ mf_d ] ) .",
    "the latter can be recast in the more transparent form @xmath57 which depends from the important quantity @xmath58 measuring the effective degree of electronic correlation as the ratio between renormalized @xmath59 ( numerator ) and phonon - renormalized kinetic energy @xmath60 ( denominator)@xcite .    in spite of these simplifications , an analytical solution of our equations",
    "is still a difficult task . in the next section we present the general solution of eqs .",

    "such anharmonic fluctuations can be partially captured by assuming that phonon wavefunctions are `` squeezed '' two - phonon coherent states ( variational squeezed , vsq ) .",
    "the simplest choice that is usually made is : @xmath74 where the e - ph induced displacement of the phonon field is still associated to the local charge state whereas the variational parameter @xmath75 controlling the squeezing of the wavefunctions is charge - independent , i.e. , as noticed first in ref .",

    "while @xmath80 still accounts for the effective e - ph - induced displacement of the ions , the variational parameter @xmath81 can be viewed as a measure of anharmonic fluctuations of the phonon wavefunctions .",
    "as we briefly discussed in the introduction , the paramagnetic phase of the half - filled hubbard - holstein model is an interesting test - field for our trial wavefunction since the interplay of the two local interaction mechanisms is more effective and at the same time more transparent because both the interaction terms are able to drive metal - insulator transitions of different nature . from a technical point of view , imposing the particle - hole symmetry simplifies the calculation , eliminating of the three self - consistency equations for the phonon wavefunctions .",
    "finally , the half - filled phase diagram has been extensively studied by means of dmft , providing us with an exact benchmark for the infinite coordination bethe lattice.@xcite    in this section we mainly focus on the metal - insulator transitions driven by the two interaction terms . in the absence of e - ph coupling",

    "the effect of correlation on polaronic physics can be analyzed by tuning electron filling , and we found that polaron formation is inhibited and pushed to higher , though finite , @xmath83 when moving from low - density to half - filled system .    relaxing the assumption of infinite repulsion between electrons , in this paper we turned our attention to the half - filling regime and considered , together with bipolaron formation , the competition between @xmath1 and the phonon - mediated bipolaron instability , ruled out by an infinite @xmath1 .",

    "is inhibited by @xmath1 faster than bipolaronic transition , and polaronic features are observed in a narrow region that rapidly shrinks with increasing @xmath1 ; at the same time a change in the order of the transition occurs depending on the strength of correlation .",
    "a critical comparison with standard variational approaches to holstein phonons shows that the proposed wavefunction can be viewed as a proper generalization apt to include correlation effects , underlying the importance of a reliable variational description of anharmonic fluctuations in the presence of @xmath1 .",
    "our wavefunction improves on previous variational approaches already in the absence of electron correlations ( vlf and vsq can indeed be obtained as restricted solutions of our method limiting the variational freedom ) , but it still has some limitations in the deep adiabatic limit due to the nature of our phonon wavefunctions , that are associated to the different local electronic states . for the same reasons , our method becomes considerably more accurate in the presence of strong correlations , that make the electronic physics more local .",
