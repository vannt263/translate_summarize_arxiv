    "we are assisting at a booming expansion of nanoparticle research and technology .",
    "synthesis method especially make fast progresses@xcite .",
    "analysis methods , however , are not up to speed . a fundamental simple task as determining and controlling",
    "the size distribution of nanoparticles ( nps hereafter ) is currently a complex experimental work , involving electron microscopy and combined techniques . in this work",
    "we want to highlight the possibilities offered in this issue by a much less complex technique as powder diffraction .",
    "powder diffraction is a widespread technique with a great potential to meet the increasing demands of microstructural material characterization .",
    "the methods of powder diffraction data analysis have reached maturity for micrometer - sized polycrystalline materials . however , when the particle size falls much below 100 nm , specifically tuned methods of analysis are needed to extract meaningful information from powder diffraction patterns .",
    "in fact , nanoparticles ( nps hereafter ) present unique analytical challenges . in the most complex cases ,",
    "non - crystallographic structures @xcite may occur .",
    "surface - related deformation fields @xcite are another challenge . in these extreme cases ,",
    "the classical crystallographic formalism becomes quite useless .",
    "the debye scattering function@xcite ( that is , the direct evaluation of the np structure factor from the interatomic distances ) is the only choice in those cases .",
    "we are currently developing @xcite methods to increase the efficiency of such calculations and make them a practical tool .",
    "even for crystalline nps , however , the small size plays a decisive role .",
    "bragg peaks may be so much broadened that they can not be simply separated and many approximations , commonly accepted for micrometer size domains , fail .",
    "as we will show , also models specifically corrected for nps@xcite may fail for ultra - small nps ( say below 5 nm diameter , as it will be better specified ) .",
    "again for these ultra - small sizes the debye scattering function is the only choice for obtaining precise results , while the smaller number of atoms makes it extremely practical .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we discuss the shape - based method for calculating np powder patterns in relation to the surface structure and to its limits of validity at small sizes .",
    "application to full - pattern fit on a test - case ( 20-nm ceo@xmath1 ) is shown in sec .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "scherrer s formula@xcite is the most known method for extracting size information from powder patterns ( namely , from the bragg peaks width ) .",
    "this is a simple method , but accurate only to the order of magnitude .",
    "however , since scherrer s work , line profile analysis has made enormous progress @xcite .",
    "theoretical progress on understanding the physical origin of peak broadening has been focused on the dislocation analysis , size broadening being considered as a side effect to be corrected for in order to determine the defect structure . nevertheless , today it is possible to determine the parameters of a ( log - normal ) size distribution of crystallites , together with information on type and concentration of dislocations .",
    "these methods are , however , complex and sophisticated , requiring a fairly high signal - to - noise ratio , low and flat background , a precise deconvolution of the instrumental broadening and especially well - isolated bragg peaks .",
    "full - pattern fitting methods ( _ cf . _ sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) are more direct and robust , especially when the target is the size analysis .",
    "firstly , they use all the experimental information , regardless of partial or total peak overlap , increasing redundancy and therefore precision and decreasing experimental requirement .",
    "furthermore , they allow the evaluation of a np - characteristic feature , namely the variation with size of the lattice parameter@xcite ( an effect that can be important below 20  nm ) .",
    "corrections for texture , microabsorption , anisotropic elastic peak shifts and instrumental broadening can also be implemented .",
    "an efficient and precise method to evaluate np diffraction patterns is needed to perform full - pattern fits .",
    "hereafter we discuss the shape - based method@xcite with a thorough analysis of its validity limits .",
    "we shortly recall some methods for the calculation of the powder diffraction intensity for a np with known periodic structure and definite size and shape . in the following the length of a vector @xmath2",
    "will be denoted by @xmath3 . accordingly",
    ", @xmath4 will be the scattering vector of length @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the scattering half - angle and @xmath7 the incident wavelength ; @xmath8 shall denote the scattering vector associated with a bragg peak , its length being @xmath9 .",
    "a np occupies a geometrical region of space @xmath10 .",
    "we recall @xcite the definition of a shape function @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 if @xmath13 lies inside @xmath10 , @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "we shall hereforth suppose that @xmath15 so that its fourier transform is real .",
    "however , defining the shape of a crystal means also to describe what happens to the atoms on the surface .",
    "these are increasingly important at very small sizes .",
    "in fact , there are different ways of interpreting the action of @xmath11 , the most meaningful ones being :    * truncating sharply the scattering density ( the electron density for x - rays ) at the surface @xcite ; * selecting all whole unit cells whose origins are in @xmath10 and all whole atoms whose centres lie in the selected cells@xcite ; * selecting all whole atoms whose centres are in @xmath10 .",
    "useful illustrations are found in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "( see figs .  1a , 1c and 1d , respectively for a , b , c ) .",
    "to evaluate the diffracted intensities , in cases b ) , c ) , one may utilize the debye function . in this way the chosen model is faithfully represented .",
    "it is possible , however , to proceed in a different way , that is , by the shape - function method .",
    "accordingly , we first evaluate the scattering amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "the explicit expressions@xcite are , for cases a , b , c : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reciprocal lattice ; @xmath19 is the fourier transform from the fourier amplitudes and @xmath20 from the related intensities , where @xmath21 is the unit cell volume . ] of @xmath11 , or @xmath22 and it satisfies @xmath23 because @xmath15 ; @xmath24 is the unit cell structure factor @xmath25 where the sum index @xmath26 runs on the atoms in the unit cell , which have form factors @xmath27 and position vectors ( relative to the cell origin ) @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is the same as the former but evaluated in @xmath4 ; and @xmath30 is the mixed expression @xmath31    it is evident that form a ) is simpler but by construction less reasonable - for electron and x - ray diffraction - than b ) and c ) .",
    "in fact , the sharp truncation of the electron density at the surface is unjustified . for neutron nuclear elastic scattering",
    "the atoms are point scatterers , therefore , construction a ) coincides with c ) .",
    "accordingly , in the neutron case , the atomic form factors are constant and @xmath32 .    form",
    "b ) depends on an appropriate choice of the unit cell .",
    "clearly , it preserves the stoichiometric composition and symmetry .",
    "form c ) needs a careful implementation ( regarding the definition of @xmath10 ) to preserve stoichiometry , that is important for ionic compounds ; however , it is clearly more flexible .",
    "remark also that , in the case of monoatomic lattices , instead - as for simple - cubic , face - centered or body - centered cubic metals - construction b ) and c ) will be coincident and @xmath33 .      squaring eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ampla],[eq : amplb],[eq : amplc ] ) we obtain the intensities . supposing @xmath34 centrosymmetric and @xmath35 real , we have @xmath36 here , we have neglected cross - summations of the form @xmath37 where overbar stands for complex conjugate and , for x = a , b , c , respectively , it is @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "neglecting @xmath41 is , first of all , a question of convenience , because its evaluation - either analytical or numerical - is a nightmare .",
    "there are obvious reasons for neglecting @xmath41 for large particles . consider a spherical particle with cubic structure with lattice parameter @xmath42 and radius @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath19 is large only for @xmath44 , and decreases as @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "as for any bragg peak @xmath8 it is @xmath47 , @xmath48 can be neglected .    for smaller particles the situation is different . in refs .",
    "it is proposed that @xmath41 is negligible due to a certain statistical ` smearing ' of the np surface region on a thickness of the order of the lattice parameter @xmath42 .",
    "however , this hypothesis can not be accepted by default .",
    "firstly , the order at the surface strongly depends on the considered crystal phase and on the actual sample .",
    "consider that for a np of diameter @xmath49 , the fraction of atoms included in a layer of thickness @xmath42 is @xmath50 ( about 50% at @xmath51 , still 12% at @xmath52 ) .",
    "the structure of this large fraction should be carefully considered on a case - by - case basis .",
    "relaxations in the core due to a disordered layer of thickness @xmath42 should also be considered . secondly , supposing a default smearing of the np boundaries flattens the different construction principles of forms a , b , c. in fact , the differences among them regard the finest details of the np surface structure .",
    "we shall hereafter assess the effect of neglecting @xmath41 on the calculation of a powder diffraction pattern .",
    "[ appa ] we carry out some relevant calculations .",
    "evidently this will depend on the choice of form a , b , or c. examples are reported in the following section .    for form",
    "@xmath53 it turns out that , even when @xmath41 is not negligible , it yields a contribution that is approximately proportional to the retained term @xmath53 of the scattered intensity .",
    "this means that the effect of neglecting @xmath41 may be just a small error on the global scale factor for samples composed of particles of equal size .",
    "however , as this effect is size - dependent , it may hamper the evaluation of size distribution when this is not very narrow . a size - related correction factor for the scale factor may - and should - be evaluated ( see app .",
    "[ appa ] ) in this case .",
    "this of course is an undesired complication .    in cases",
    "a ) and c ) the neglected term @xmath41 depends on the crystal structure ( see app .",
    "[ appa ] ) .",
    "it is not a constant scale factor for all bragg peaks , and it may have a significant gradient in the bragg peak positions .",
    "at very small sizes the latter may induce a systematic error also in the lattice constant determination .",
    "however , in the x - ray case , for form a ) @xmath41 is larger - and has a larger gradient in the bragg peak neighbourhood - than the corresponding term for form c ) .      to obtain a powder diffraction pattern",
    ", we must integrate @xmath54 ( x = a , b , c , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ampla],[eq : amplb],[eq : amplc ] ) ) at constant @xmath55 .",
    "we write @xmath4 in polar coordinates as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the orientation defined by the pair @xmath58 .",
    "we have to integrate over the set of all orientations @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) , as @xmath61 in detail , considering the expressions for the different cases , we have @xmath62 the integration in case b ) is much more difficult and it can not generally be expressed in closed form even for simple shapes .",
    "therefore , as a careful implementation of form c ) is at least as good a description as form b ) , we shall disregard b ) in the following .",

    "a small variation of the debye - waller factor ( from 0.005 to 0.0047  nm@xmath79 ) is due to the fact that the @xmath94-neglection error changes slightly the intensity ratios .",
