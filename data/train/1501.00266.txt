    "one way of finding rates of reaction is to consider rates of transport in a low dimensional hamiltonian system representing the specific reaction . some of the first examples studied using transition state theory consisted of bimolecular reaction in gaseous phase , i.e. @xmath4 for two ( polyatomic ) molecules @xmath5 and @xmath6 . provided",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation holds , we can pass from the quantum mechanical system to a classical one , namely the hamiltonian system for the motion of the nuclei interacting via a potential given by the ( ground state ) energy of the electrons as a function of the internuclear coordinates . then , if this extremely high dimensional hamiltonian system is , at any instant , the product of `` reacting '' two molecule sub - systems that are independent of each other , we may consider the evolution of an ensemble of individual reactions in this low dimensional hamiltonian sub - system . for this , we require the gas to be sufficiently dilute . see keck @xcite for a nice review of transition state theory and discussion of the assumptions involved . finally , since the low dimensional system is hamiltonian and energy is conserved , we can restrict our attention to the energy levels , and consider the flow of ergode , as a function of the energy . finding ( microcanonical ) reaction rates",
    "translates to finding the rate of transport of ergode between regions representing reactants and products .",
    "transition state theory provides upper bounds on rates of transport via the flux of ergode through a _ dividing surface _ that separates the regions of interest",
    ". the dividing surface approach , which we reviewed in @xcite , can be traced back to the works of marcelin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) and wigner @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain a useful upper bound , the dividing surface is chosen to have locally minimum flux in a given direction .",
    "for this to be the case , the dividing surface must be the union of surfaces of unidirectional stationary flux with no local recrossings , which in turn is the case for surfaces spanning a closed , invariant , orientable , codimension-2 submanifold of the energy level , known as a _",
    "transition state_. the simplest transition states and dividing surfaces are found in the basic transport scenario of `` flux over a saddle '' @xcite .",
    "these are transition states diffeomorphic to @xmath7 for energies just above the index-1 critical point of the hamiltonian for @xmath8 degree of freedom systems , with dividing surfaces diffeomorphic to @xmath9 . for two degree of freedom systems , these transition states are hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "as the energy is increased , they may lose normal hyperbolicity and bifurcate .",
    "the bifurcations of periodic orbits are well known , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.6 ) , and those of periodic orbit transition states have been studied for a long time , see e.g. @xcite . instead , for higher degrees of freedom than two the transition states for the basic scenario are normally hyperbolic @xmath10 spheres ( within the energy levels ) and very little is known about their bifurcations .",
    "what had been overlooked , and was explained in @xcite , is that the transition states may lose normal hyperbolicity by becoming singular , i.e.  the manifold structure fails , at a higher critical energy value but then regain their normal hyperbolicity for values above the critical energy .",
    "these are _ morse bifurcations _",
    "* appendix b ) , leading to a change in diffeomorphism class of the transition states and dividing surfaces spanning them .",
    "they occur when the union of transition states over a range of energies forms a smooth normally hyperbolic submanifold of state space , which we call a _ transition manifold _ , and there is a critical value of the hamiltonian function restricted to the transition manifold . by definition ,",
    "the transition states are the level sets of this restricted hamiltonian and undergo a bifurcation .",
    "similarly , the dividing surfaces , which span the transition manifold , undergo a morse bifurcation .",
    "actually , they occur because the energy levels undergo a morse bifurcation themselves so the dividing surfaces , and therefore the transition states , must also undergo a change of diffeomorphism class in order to still separate these in two .",
    "morse theory tells us that we can continue the transition states and dividing surfaces , with respect to the energy , through critical values , as well as giving the diffeomorphism class of the submanifolds .",
    "this is useful , for example , when the transition states above some critical energy are disjoint , which we shall see in the atom - frozen diatom system , as we then know exactly what objects to look for .",
    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in general transport problems ( as opposed to the basic one ) , non - minimum energy paths @xcite , and roaming reactions @xcite .",
    "these transport scenarios may emerge from the basic one via a morse bifurcation , in which case by considering these bifurcations , we obtain transition states and dividing surfaces that can be used to find the rates of transport",
    ".    we shall consider transport between the region representing two distant molecules ( reactants ) and the region in which the molecules are close .",
    "the latter does not however generally constitute the products .",
    "this is the _ capture _ transport problem associated with the necessary first step of the molecules getting close enough to react",
    ". the _ capture rate _",
    "( sometimes also called _ collision rate _ ) provides an upper bound on the reaction rate , as we do not expect all captured trajectories to proceed to the products region @xcite .",
    "note that there might actually be multiple product regions , but for a two - body capture process there is only one final region of interest .",
    "capture rates are crucial for many physical processes , and have a long history dating back at least to 1905 with langevin s early contribution @xcite , see review by chesnavich and bowers @xcite .",
    "two assumptions are usually found in the literature .",
    "firstly , the reacting hamiltonian systems are assumed to have euclidean symmetry , that is to be invariant under translations and rotations .",
    "this is the case for gas phase reactions with no background ( electro - magnetic ) field .",
    "the hamiltonian system can then be reduced to a family of systems , in centre of mass frame , parametrised by the angular momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian function then contains both coriolis and centrifugal terms .",
    "secondly , the energy is taken to be below those at which the two molecules dissociate and centrifugal and coriolis forces to be sufficiently weak such that the molecules are well defined and in the small vibrations regime .",
    "these assumptions allow to distinguish between intermolecular degrees of freedom ( distance and relative attitudes of the molecules ) and intramolecular ones .",
    "we too shall consider systems that satisfy these assumptions .",
    "we want to find the rate of capture , which we shall assume can be thought of as transport between regions on either side of a non - degenerate maximum @xmath11 of the effective potential ( centrifugal terms plus potential ) with respect to the intermolecular distance @xmath12 . in the literature , this maximum is generally a centrifugal maximum obtained by balancing the repulsive centrifugal terms with the attractive long distance potential energy .",
    "alternatively , @xmath11 could be a non - degenerate chemical maximum of the bimolecular potential and therefore of the effective potential for small angular momentum .",
    "provided @xmath11 is sufficiently large , such that capture occurs in a region where the potential is only weakly dependent upon the attitudes of the molecules , and sufficiently non - degenerate , we shall see that fixing the intermolecular distance degree of freedom to the maximum value gives a normally hyperbolic transition manifold in state space , which can be spanned by a dividing manifold .",
    "the restriction of these manifolds to the energy levels gives dividing surfaces and transition states , which we shall refer to as _ capture _ transition states .",
    "the literature often refers to them as _ orbiting _ or _ loose _ transition states @xcite .",
    "the central field model , in which the attitudes of the colliding pair are ignored , is attributed to langevin @xcite . in this very early work ,",
    "one already finds capture periodic orbit transition states .",
    "langevin considers the capture process using scattering theory . for",
    "an introduction to scattering theory see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.10 ) , whereas for a comparison with the dividing surface approach see @xcite .",
    "non - central fields were considered later , also usually from a scattering theory perspective , starting with the works of pechukas @xcite and chesnavich , su and bowers @xcite . as the energy is increased above the critical energy for first connection between reactants and `` products '' , the intermolecular attitude and angular momentum degrees of freedom",
    "will generally be involved in interesting sequences of morse bifurcations causing changes in the diffeomorphism class of the energy levels , as the `` cone of acceptance '' ( i.e.  orientations for which capture is possible ) opens up , and therefore changes of the capture transition states and dividing surfaces . instead , the intramolecular degrees of freedom are assumed to consist of small vibrations , thus not playing a role in the morse bifurcations .",
    "using morse theory , one can know which the correct transition states and dividing surfaces are , as we shall outline for two examples , and then study rates of transport for larger energies than previously thought possible . here , we shall focus on the morse bifurcations , the reduction and the details of bimolecular capture problems .",
    "some analysis of `` reaction dynamics '' of rotating molecules has been done recently in @xcite , but we are interested in the interaction of two rotating molecules .    whether captured pairs then go on to react can be thought of as a further transport problem with its own ( _ reaction _ ) transition states and dividing surfaces , possibly ( but not necessarily ) associated to other maxima @xmath13 of the effective potential .",
    "these are often referred to as _",
    "tight _ transition states .",
    "the capture and reaction transition states are therefore in series .",
    "the simplest case will be when these are distant and the level sets of separate transition manifolds .",
    "however , even when `` separate '' their stable and unstable manifolds , which act as transport barriers , will intersect , determining the `` reaction channels '' .",
    "some trajectories joining reactants and products might roam in the region between the ( capture and reaction ) dividing surfaces , that is follow trajectories with a non - monotonic intermolecular distance in time , before finally crossing the reaction dividing surface .",
    "this is to be expected due to coupling between degrees of freedom , and was recently given as an explanation of what has been called _ roaming reactions _",
    "@xcite .",
    "reaction rates have an equally long history as capture rates , and bimolecular reactions have played the role of test problems since the early days of transition state theory ( as noted in @xcite ) .",
    "the transport problems associated with reaction tend to be harder because the chemical potentials are at best not simple and often degenerate .",
    "similarly to how the first capture models were simplified by making the fields central , reaction rates were first , and largely still , considered for collinear and planar systems with zero angular momentum .",
    "note that reaction transition states will also generally undergo morse bifurcations .",
    "hamiltonian systems with symmetry , such as the molecular @xmath14 body systems with euclidean symmetry considered here , have conserved quantities by noether s theorem ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 5 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.7 ) ) , and can be reduced via symplectic reduction .",
    "the euclidean symmetry group of our @xmath14 body systems is a semi - direct product @xmath15 and can be reduced in stages ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) .",
    "the translational symmetry and associated linear momentum are easily reduced , whereas the rotational symmetry , which does not act freely on the whole of state space , and the associated angular momentum require singular reduction , see e.g. @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) .",
    "the reduced state space is therefore a stratified symplectic manifold , however the hamiltonian flow leaves the connected components of the strata invariant so the reduced dynamics can be studied on each stratum individually",
    ". the stratified symplectic manifold for our reduced molecular @xmath14 body systems is composed of three strata . both singular strata have zero angular momentum , whereas on the principal stratum the angular momentum is arbitrary .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite .",
    "actually , reactions with initial positions and momenta confined to a plane remain in this plane for all successive times , and reduced planar systems have no angular momentum degree of freedom and no coordinate singularities at collinear configurations . in section [ planaratomdiatom ] ,",
    "we therefore consider planar capture between an atom and a diatom and find our first examples of morse bifurcations .",
    "this example and that of two interacting diatoms were considered in less detail in @xcite .",
    "a spatial example , of an atom interacting with a molecule , is considered in section [ spatialbimol ] .",
    "we choose to use the coordinates that one obtains via the gauge theoretic approach to cotangent bundle reduction as outlined by littlejohn and reinsch @xcite , and reviewed in appendix [ bigauge ] , where we discuss the symplectic form and consider the transformation to serret - andoyer coordinates on the angular momentum sphere , which is not done in @xcite .",
    "this approach gives coordinates , which are furthermore physically meaningful since coordinates and momenta are not mixed , however it involves considering the rotational @xmath16 action on configuration space as opposed to the lifted action in state space , and therefore introduces coordinate singularities .",
    "these are avoided by considering non - collinear molecules .",
    "ways to deal with them are discussed in the conclusions in section [ conclude ] .",
    "the simplest non - trivial capture example is planar reactions between an atom and a diatom .",
    "the planar reduced three - body hamiltonian system that represents an atom interacting with a diatom with no background field is the family of mechanical systems @xmath17 , parametrised by the angular momentum @xmath18 , with @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath12 is the intermolecular distance , @xmath22 the attitude and @xmath23 the length of the diatom , see figure [ jacobifig ] .",
    "@xmath24 is the effective potential with the centrifugal term .",
    "the parameters are the reduced masses @xmath8 and @xmath25 , and the magnitude of the angular momentum @xmath26",
    ".    we shall restrict our attention to energies below that at which the diatom dissociates , so we have a two - body capture problem .",
    "specifically , we shall consider the capture of an atom by a strongly bonded diatom that is distant and rotating slowly , assuming that the potential of the pair has a non - degenerate maximum @xmath11 with respect to @xmath12 for large @xmath12 , and that the centrifugal and coriolis forces are not too large .",
    "thus , for energies below that at which the diatom dissociates , the reduced coordinates and their momenta split into intermolecular @xmath27 and intramolecular @xmath23 degrees of freedom .",
    "our assumptions imply that the diatom is in the small vibrations regime , i.e.  @xmath28 is an elliptic degree of freedom , and rotating slowly , so in the neighbourhood of @xmath11 we will find a codimension-2 normally hyperbolic submanifolds @xmath29 and span it by a dividing manifold @xmath30",
    ". this will be the capture dividing manifold that trajectories must cross in order for capture to occur .",
    "the assumptions will be introduced by scaling the coordinates , after which the dynamics and the existence of the transition manifold @xmath29 will be clear .",
    "then , we will show that the level sets of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the transition states @xmath31 and dividing surfaces @xmath32 , generically undergo morse bifurcations involving the @xmath33 degree of freedom , as the energy is varied .    for simplicity , the masses of the atom and the diatom are set to @xmath34",
    ". a better approach would be to non - dimensionalise the variables .",
    "note that normalised or mass - weighted jacobi coordinates do not remove the mass dependence .",
    "the intermolecular terms of the potential will be repulsive at short ranges , possibly have a number of maxima ( and therefore minima ) with respect to the intermolecular distance @xmath12 in the mid ranges , and be attractive at long ranges with inverse @xmath35-power of @xmath12 terms @xcite , see figure [ atomdiatomxpot ] .",
    "the potential is then summed to the repulsive centrifugal term to give the effective potential . in the long ( physical ) range , provided the attractive potential falls off faster than the centrifugal potential as @xmath36 , i.e.  @xmath37 , the effective potential has a centrifugal maximum @xmath38 . in the short ( chemical )",
    "range of the potential , the chemical maxima of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath12 imply chemical maxima of @xmath24 for @xmath26 small with respect to the slope of @xmath39 at the maxima . in either case , as @xmath26 increases the maxima will `` collide '' with the minima and disappear , see figure [ atomdiatomxpot ] .",
    "we shall think of capture as transport between the regions on either side of the largest maximum @xmath40 , assumed large with respect to the length of the diatom @xmath23 .",
    "we introduce the capture scale by setting @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 , and taking @xmath11 to be of order 1 . essentially , @xmath44 is the ratio between the size of the diatom and its distance to the atom , however in practice we assume that for distant pairs , the potential energy is weakly dependent on the attitude of the diatom , since the pair are distant , and we can choose @xmath44 such that @xmath45 this is the case for potentials that are inverse power functions of the intermolecular distance , which can be expanded using legendre polynomials .",
    "the hamiltonian function expands into @xmath46 where we have dropped the tildes .",
    "we note that @xmath22 does not appear until order @xmath47 , so @xmath48 with constant @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , the system separates into slow and fast degrees of freedom , i.e.  at order @xmath50 we find the fast oscillations of the diatom plus a `` centrifugal '' term , at order @xmath51 there is the intermolecular ( capture ) dynamics , and then there are the higher order terms . up to order @xmath51 ,",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath23 degrees of freedom are uncoupled , and @xmath52 .",
    "the diatom will have an equilibrium configuration , which corresponds to a non - degenerate minimum @xmath53 of the joint atom - diatom potential with respect to the intramolecular distance @xmath23 .",
    "we assume this minimum to be highly non - degenerate , i.e.  that the diatom is strongly bonded , and that the centrifugal and coriolis forces on the diatom are not too strong , so the diatom will vibrate about its equilibrium without significant distortion .",
    "we therefore , linearise @xmath23 about @xmath54 by setting @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the constant @xmath58 is chosen such that @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is order one , and @xmath62 . recall that we are assuming @xmath63 to be large .",
    "this scaling ensures that the leading order terms of the potential with respect to the coordinates are of the same order as their conjugate momenta in the kinetic energy . the hamiltonian function , again dropping the tildes , becomes @xmath64    we shall further simplify our hamiltonian by setting @xmath65 , i.e.  considering @xmath66 .",
    "general @xmath67 is considered in the disconnecting example of @xcite .",
    "the scaled system consists of @xmath68 and @xmath69 from which we get the equations of motion up to order @xmath70 , namely @xmath71    by assumption , the intermolecular distance degree of freedom is hyperbolic , and the intramolecular distance is in the small vibrations regime , i.e.  elliptic .",
    "these dynamics are uncoupled to this order .",
    "as the diatom rotates , the attitude degree of freedom will display both kinds of motion . provided the @xmath72 degree of freedom is more strongly hyperbolic that the @xmath33 one , that is the maximum @xmath11 is sufficiently non - degenerate , the submanifold @xmath73 is almost invariant , or more precisely invariant to order @xmath70 , and normally hyperbolic . by normal hyperbolicity theory",
    ", there is a true normally hyperbolic submanifold @xmath29 nearby .",
    "given @xmath74 , we could find a better approximation to @xmath29 as explained in @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of studying the morse bifurcations of the transition states , @xmath74 is a sufficiently good approximation .",
    "the normally hyperbolic submanifold @xmath29 is a transition manifold , as it can be spanned by a dividing manifold .",
    "the approximate transition manifold @xmath74 is spanned by @xmath75 the transition states @xmath31 and dividing surfaces @xmath32 are then approximately the level sets of the hamiltonian restricted to the approximate transition and dividing manifolds .",
    "as the energy varies , we expect these to bifurcate .",
    "the transition states may lose normal hyperbolicity . for atom - diatom reactions , @xmath31 are 3-dimensional manifolds , so it is not well understood how they lose normal hyperbolicity . freezing the diatom , the system only has two degrees of freedom and @xmath31 is a periodic orbit . in @xcite , we saw that these disappear in a centre - saddle bifurcation . however , before the loss of normal hyperbolicity , the capture transition states will undergo changes of diffeomorphism class via morse bifurcations .",
    "if we write @xmath76 we find that the hamiltonian function restricted to the transition manifold @xmath29 is independent of @xmath77 and @xmath78 up to order @xmath47 , namely @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the non - canonical momentum , and we dropped constant terms .    for @xmath81 below",
    "that at which the diatom dissociates , the intramolecular degree of freedom contributes only positive - definite terms to the restricted hamiltonian function and is not involved in any morse bifurcations , which can be studied by considering the simpler function obtained by freezing the diatom , i.e.  minimising @xmath82 over @xmath28 by setting @xmath83 and @xmath84 giving @xmath85    different reactions , i.e.  choices of atom and diatom , will have different potentials and different sequences of morse bifurcations .",

    "the first is that @xmath266 does not contain points @xmath228 at which the @xmath245 , @xmath246 principal moments become equal .",
    "the order of the bifurcations then depends on the relative heights of the critical energies , and both cases are straightforward , see figure [ spatialcase1 ] .",
    "the other scenario is when @xmath266 does contain @xmath228 .",
    "we shall consider the case in which it contains only one pair of such points .",

    "if the centrifugal energy is smaller than the attitude potential , then the points @xmath244 at which the moments @xmath245 , @xmath246 are not distinct do not play a role in the morse bifurcations , which are the same as those for the case when @xmath266 does not contain @xmath228 , as we can see by comparing the left hand side of figures [ spatialcase1 ] .",
    "instead , when the molecular potential is smaller than the centrifugal one , depicted on the right in figure [ spatialcase1 ] , we see that the points @xmath244 do play a significant role in the bifurcations and the sub - level sets of the torus bifurcate as follows @xmath268 where @xmath269 and @xmath270 can be written as handlebodies using morse theorem b @xcite",
    ". therefore , the sub - level sets of the capture transition manifold @xmath96 have the following sequence of bifurcations @xmath271 and the transition states @xmath272 similarly for the dividing surfaces .    finally , if we were to consider higher energies for this choice of @xmath103 , the other attitude would also become involved in morse bifurcations . here",
    "again the @xmath228 points would most likely lead to interesting sequences of morse bifurcations , however we would also have to deal with the non - trivial nature of the fibre bundle .",
    "after the morse bifurcations at the index-2 critical points @xmath260 , the base space would contain a 2-sphere , and many examples of non - trivial orientable bundles over these can be found .",
    "thus before we can consider the full sequence of morse bifurcations of the dividing surfaces and transition states and the transport for a larger range of energies , the bundle class of the reduced state space needs to be understood .",
    "the purpose of this article was to show that morse bifurcations must be considered when studying transport problems for larger ranges of energies , and more specifically to show the existence of morse bifurcations of capture transition states and dividing surfaces for bimolecular reactions . by considering the different sequences of morse bifurcations we were able to find interesting new transition states and dividing surfaces for general reactions with non - zero angular momentum , thus extending the dividing surface approach beyond the well known basic transport scenario .",
    "other choices of molecules than those considered here will have similar capture transport problems and therefore similar transition states and bifurcations .",
    "the flux of ergode through a dividing surface as a function of energy and the effect of the morse bifurcations was considered in @xcite and commented upon in section [ atomdiatom ] for planar atom - diatom reactions .",
    "seeing as the systems representing these examples have more than 2 degrees of freedom , apart from the unrealistic planar atom - frozen diatom case , the morse bifurcations do not have a significant effect on the flux , which varies @xmath107 smoothly through these .",
    "the actual use of capture rates as bounds on reaction rates is debatable , but largely depends on the reaction being considered .",
    "however , these were only chosen to provide relatively simple examples of morse bifurcations , and to show the importance of the attitude and angular momentum degrees of freedom in bimolecular reactions .",
    "we considered bimolecular reactions with euclidean symmetry and reduced them accordingly .",
    "even though ( symplectic ) reduction theory is a highly developed subject , we faced a number of difficulties when considering these examples . setting aside the fact that singular reduction was required , due to the nature of the rotational symmetry , and that singular cotangent bundle reduction is still not a complete theory , there is a large gap between the reduction theory literature and applications . even if one restricts one s attention to the principal non - singular stratum , it is not an easy task to find suitable charts .",
    "some of the literature avoids charts altogether , focusing instead on the global geometric properties of the reduced spaces , whereas the celestial mechanics literature considers charts for different regions of the reduced space .",
    "the most common approach in the molecular literature is to restrict one s attention to non - collinear configurations such that the gauge theoretic approach to cotangent bundle reduction provides a set of charts , as reviewed in appendix [ bigauge ] .",
    "however , here we face the opposite issue , namely the reduced space is an @xmath116 fibre bundle , due to the angular momentum degree of freedom , but the global nature of this bundle is generally not discussed in the literature .",
    "we feel that more work is needed , both on charts for the reduced spaces and on their global nature , and that this would improve our understanding of molecular reactions , and also other @xmath14-body systems .    by considering normal molecules , with a fixed equilibrium configuration and energies below that",
    "at which either of the two molecules dissociates , collinearity becomes a decreasing concern with increasing size of the molecules , namely codimension-@xmath273 where @xmath274 is the number of atoms in the @xmath275th molecule ( @xmath276 ) , and the chemistry of the molecule is not taken into account .",
    "however , for smaller molecules , higher energies , or other transport problems we may need to consider collinear configurations . for non - zero angular momentum , collinear configurations are a subset of the principal reduced stratum . however",
    "due to collinear configurations having non - trivial configuration space isotropy , we can not find charts via the gauge theoretic approach to cotangent bundle reduction .",
    "the issue is therefore not one of reduction per se , but only of finding suitable coordinates .",
    "the transport problem and bifurcations of transition states will be the same as those considered in section [ spatialbimol ] . for more than seventy years , chemists have been using charts obtained by modifying gauge theoretic cotangent bundle reduction @xcite .",
    "the idea is to pass to a rotating frame in which the collinear ( equilibrium ) configuration is along a chosen axis , say the @xmath132-axis , but retain the remaining rotational symmetry ( about @xmath132 ) as an internal coordinate . then by choosing the eckart convention and the non - gauge invariant form of the kinetic energy , we find that the lagrangian is not a function of the angular velocity about the collinear axis @xmath277 , so we can obtain a hamiltonian that is not a function of the first angular momentum component @xmath278 .",
    "that is , @xmath278 is replaced by the canonical momentum conjugate to the `` internal '' rotation about the @xmath132-axis .",
    "these charts were first considered by sayvetz @xcite , though nowadays they are often attributed to watson @xcite .",
    "this procedure can be justified geometrically by applying the slice theorem ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3.14 ) ) to configuration space in a neighbourhood of the collinear configurations , and then lifting the charts obtained to the cotangent bundle @xcite .",
    "actually , with this understanding , charts can be obtained that are not those of the eckart convention , i.e.  other gauges and internal coordinates .",
    "this was used in examples by kozin et al .",
    "note that this is just the splitting of coordinates into internal coordinates and rotations and not an actual reduction , cf .",
    "appendix [ bigauge ] . with these charts",
    ", we can not simply pass to serret - andoyer coordinates to reduce the symmetry , seeing as the hamiltonian is not a function of @xmath278 .",
    "this is generally not addressed in literature .",
    "the transport problems associated with reaction are usually a lot more complicated than the capture ones considered here , so their transition states may undergo a number of different bifurcations .",
    "one simple example which should display much the same bifurcations as those seen here is isomerization reactions involving only one molecule .",
    "these will be the topic of a future publication .",
    "we have concentrated here on how the transition state and dividing surface vary with energy , but the exact dependence of the capture transition states on the angular momentum and the possible loss of normal hyperbolicity for large values should be considered in detail . due to the high degrees of freedom of these systems , this is not a straightforward task .",
    "it is also interesting to ask whether the dividing surface method can be extended to consider reactions with a varying external field or laser pulse , which need to be modelled as a non - autonomous hamiltonian system ; or reactions that are not in the ( dilute ) gas phase , for which the product kinetic approximation leading to a low dimensional hamiltonian system is not valid ; or even reactions out of equilibrium .",
    "reviews of the dividing surface approach applied to the basic transport scenario of flux over a saddle for non - autonomous systems and langevin systems can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , more work is required to consider general transport scenarios and fully understand transport in these systems .",

    "this is a different issue from the stratification of the reduced state space .",

    "the molecular literature usually does not pass to the gauge - invariant form of the kinetic energy , see discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iv.f ) .",
    "by introducing the rotating frame , we have split the coordinates into internal coordinates @xmath123 , ( ignorable ) rotations @xmath343 and their momenta , but we have not actually reduced the system . since @xmath344 are non - canonical , the fact that @xmath343 are ignorable does nt lead to @xmath111 being constant .",
    "we can however pass from the non - canonical @xmath344 to canonical serret - andoyer coordinates @xmath345 which consist of the total angular momentum @xmath346 plus two projections of @xmath111 , which we are free to choose , and three angles .",
    "the choice of projection onto the @xmath132 and @xmath347-axis is shown in figure [ bimolando ] .",
    "we immediately note that @xmath348 which we need to transform the hamiltonian function , whereas the relations between the new angles @xmath349 and the non - canonical angular momentum coordinates is less straightforward and depends on the original choice of euler angles .",
    "these are of no use to us here , but can be found in @xcite and @xcite , where @xmath345 are shown to be canonical coordinates .",
    "the hamiltonian in these new coordinates is @xmath350 therefore , the system is reduced by eliminating the ignorable degree of freedom @xmath351 , fixing @xmath352 , which is the constant absolute value of the angular momentum , and eliminating @xmath353 .",
    "the remaining angular momentum coordinates @xmath354 are the canonical latitude and longitude on the angular momentum sphere @xmath120 , henceforth denoted @xmath124 , and there is a coordinate singularity at @xmath355 .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian function is @xmath356 and @xmath357    the choice of projection is equivalent to a choice of which axis to use as a longitude for @xmath358 .",
    "the transformation for other projections is equivalent . by considering e.g.  minor and major principal axes ,",
    "we get two charts that cover the whole of @xmath358 .",
    "this appendix contains the scaling of the moment of inertia tensor , the gauge potential and the reduced metric for the spatial atom - diatom molecule capture problem of section [ spatialbimol ] .",
    "the intermolecular distance degree of freedom is scaled as @xmath140 and @xmath141 , whereas the intramolecular coordinates are shifted such that @xmath142 at the equilibrium , and then scaled as @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the scaled , rotating frame jacobi vectors are @xmath359 where @xmath360 are equilibrium configuration vectors , @xmath361 determines the orientation of @xmath6 and the @xmath362 constants @xmath363 determine the intramolecular coordinates @xmath23 and shall be chosen along the lines of the eckart @xcite and sayvetz @xcite conventions for normal and anomalous molecules in the small vibration regime .",
    "if we write the moment of inertia tensor as @xmath364 then @xmath365 where @xmath366 .",
    "thus , it scales to @xmath367 where @xmath368 , and we choose @xmath134 with @xmath135 , via @xmath369 and the rotation of @xmath6 about @xmath132 , i.e.  @xmath370 .",
    "the inverse moment of inertia matrix exists , since @xmath129 is a real , symmetric and positive definite for @xmath6 non - collinear , and scales as @xmath371    for our choice of coordinates and gauge , the gauge potential @xmath372 has @xmath373 and we ask that @xmath374 for all @xmath375 , i.e. @xmath376 this is known as the eckart condition , and imposes @xmath377 conditions on @xmath378 .",
    "the gauge potential scales to @xmath379 where @xmath380 and @xmath381 for @xmath382 .    finally , for the reduced metric @xmath383 , which is a real , symmetric , positive definite matrix , we consider the pseudo - metric @xmath384 and write @xmath385 where @xmath386 and @xmath387 we ask that @xmath388 for all @xmath389 .",
    "that is we choose williamson normal form coordinates for the intramolecular degrees of freedom .",
    "these are @xmath390 conditions on @xmath391 .",
    "furthermore , we claim that due to eckart condition @xmath392 for all @xmath389 , i.e. @xmath393 let us consider the case with @xmath394 .",
    "the euler angles @xmath22 can be chosen in a number of ways , and the rotation matrix written as @xmath395 , where @xmath396 is a rotation by @xmath397 about some axis @xmath398 .",
    "recall that the symmetry about @xmath132 has been reduced and @xmath399 .",
    "thus @xmath400 where @xmath401 is a rotation about @xmath402 by @xmath403 and simultaneously a contraction in the @xmath402 direction to zero .",
    "this can be seen by considering planar rotation matrices .",
    "then @xmath404 where @xmath405 and @xmath406 by the eckart condition .",
    "thus @xmath407 , and the same is true for @xmath408 .",
    "the gauge dependent term of @xmath383 instead scales to @xmath409 so @xmath410 and @xmath411 by inverting the matrix blockwise , and expanding inverse matrices in formal power series ."
