    "deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) is the molecule of life as we know it .",
    "it contains all information of an entire organism .",
    "this information is copied during cell division with an extremely high fidelity by the replication mechanism . despite the rather high chemical and physical stability of dna , due to constant action of enzymes and other binding proteins ( mismatches , rupture ) as well as potential environmentally induced damage ( radiation , chemicals ) , this low error rate , i.e.",
    ", the suppression of the liability to mutations , is only possible with the constant action of repair mechanisms @xcite .",
    "although dna s structural and mechanical properties are rather well established for isolated dna molecules ( starting with rosalind franklin s x - ray diffraction images @xcite ) , the characterisation of dna in its cellular environment , and even in vitro during interaction with binding proteins , is subject of ongoing investigations .",
    "recent advances in experimental techniques such as fluorescence methods , atomic force microscopy , or optical tweezers have leveraged the potential to both probe and manipulate the equilibrium and out of equilibrium behaviour of _ single _ dna molecules , making it possible to explore dna s physical and mechanical properties as well as its interaction with other biopolymers , such as the dna - protein interplay during gene regulation or repair processes .",
    "an important ingredient is the coupling to thermal activation due to the highly brownian environment .",
    "although mostly performed in vitro , these experiments provide access to increasingly refined information on the nature of dna and its environment - controlled behaviour .",
    "in addition to chromosomal packaging inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and the concentration of dna in the membraneless nucleoid region of prokaryotes , the global structure of the dna molecule can be affected by topological entanglements .",
    "thus , by error or design a dna molecule can attain a knotted or concatenated state , reducing or inhibiting biologically relevant functions , for instance , replication or transcription .",
    "such entangled states can be actively reduced by enzymes of the topoisomerase family . their precise action , in particular ,",
    "how they determine the presence of an entangled state , is not fully known .",
    "current studies therefore aim at shedding light on possible mechanisms , in particular , in view of the importance of topoisomerase action ( or better , its inhibition ) in tumour proliferation .",
    "other applications may be directed towards the treatment of viral deceases by modifying the packaging of viral dna to create knots in the virus capsid and prevent ejection of the dna into a host , and thereby infection .",
    "dna knots are also being recognised as a potential complication in the use of nanochannels for dna separation and sequencing .",
    "in such confined geometries dna knots are created with appreciable probability , affecting the reliability of these techniques . similarly to dna knots , dna looping is intimately connected to the function of dna .",
    "current results on dna looping and dna knot behaviour are summarised in the first parts of this review .",
    "the watson - crick double - helix represents the thermodynamically stable state of dna at moderate salt concentrations and below the melting temperature .",
    "this stability is effected by watson - crick hydrogen bonding and the stronger base stacking of neighbouring base - pairs ( bps ) . however , even at room temperature dna locally opens up intermittent flexible single - stranded domains , so - called dna - bubbles .",
    "their size typically ranges from a few broken bps , increasing to some 200 broken bps closer to the melting temperature .",
    "the thermal melting of dna has traditionally been used to obtain the sequence - dependent stability parameters of dna .",
    "more recently , the role of intermittent bubble domains has been investigated with respect to the liability of dna - denaturation induced by proteins that selectively bind to single - stranded dna .",
    "it has been speculated that due to the liability to denaturation of the tata motif bubble formation may add in transcription initiation .",
    "the dynamics of single bubbles can be monitored by fluorescence methods , opening a window to both study the breathing of dna experimentally , but also to obtain high precision dna stability data .",
    "finally , bubble dynamics has been suggested as a useful tool in optical nanosensing .",
    "dna breathing is the topic of the second part of this work .",
    "essentially all the biological functions of dna rely on site - specific dna - binding proteins locating their targets ( cognate sites ) on the dna molecule , and therefore require searching through megabases of non - target dna in a highly efficient manner .",
    "for instance , gene regulation is performed by specific regulatory proteins .",
    "on binding to a promoter area on the dna , they recruit or inhibit binding of rna polymerase and subsequent transcription of the associated gene .",
    "the search for the cognate site is in fact facilitated by the dna molecule : in addition to three - dimensional search it enables the proteins to also move one - dimensionally along the dna while being non - specifically bound .",
    "moreover , at points where the dna loops back on itself , this polymeric conformation provides shortcuts for the proteins in the chemical coordinate along the dna , approximately giving rise to search - efficient lvy flights .",
    "target search is currently a very active field of research , and single molecule methods have been shown to provide essential new information .",
    "moreover , the architecture of more complex promoters relying on the simultaneous presence of several regulatory proteins is being investigated to create in silico circuits for highly sensitive chemical probes in small volumes .",
    "such nanosensing applications are expected to be of great importance in microarrays or other nano- and microapplications .",
    "the third part of this review deals with diffusional aspects of gene regulation .    at the same time dna s role in classical polymer physics",
    "is increasingly appreciated . with the possibility to reproduce dna with extremely low error rate by the pcr , monodisperse samples can be prepared . while shorter single - stranded dna can be used as a model for flexible polymers , the double strand exhibits a semiflexible behaviour with a persistence length , that can be easily probed experimentally .",
    "moreover , dna is orders of magnitude longer than conventional polymers .",
    "combined with the potential of single molecule probing , dna is advancing as a model polymer .",
    "after an introduction to the properties of dna we address these functional properties of dna from the perspective of biological relevance , physical behaviour and nanotechnological potential . most emphasis will be put on the single molecular aspects of dna .",
    "we note that this is not intended to be an exhaustive review on the physical properties of dna .",
    "rather , we present some important features and their consequences from a personal perspective .",
    "biomolecules , that occur naturally in biological systems , can be grouped into unspecific oligo- and macromolecules and biopolymers in the stricter sense @xcite .",
    "unspecific biomolecules are produced by biological organisms in a large range of molecular weight and structure , such as polysaccharides ( cellulose , chitin , starch , etc . ) , higher fatty acids , actin filaments or microtubules .",
    "also the natural ` india - rubber ' from the _ hevea brasiliensis _",
    "tree , historically important for both industrial purposes and the development of polymer physics @xcite belongs to this group .    , width=241 ]",
    "biopolymers in the stricter sense we are going to assume here comprise the polynucleotides dna and rna consisting of the four - letter nucleotide alphabet with a - t and g - c ( a - u and g - c for rna ) bps , and the polypeptidic proteins consisting of 20 different amino acids , each coded for by 3 bases ( codons ) in the rna @xcite .",
    "we will come back to proteins later when reviewing binding protein - dna interactions .",
    "biopolymers are copied and/or created according to the information flow sketched in figure [ crick ] , the so - called central dogma of molecular biology , a term originally coined by frances crick @xcite . accordingly , starting from the genetic code stored in the dna ( in some cases in rna ) dna is copied by dna polymerase ( replication ) , and the proteins as the actually task - performing biopolymers are created via messenger rna ( created by dna transcription through rna polymerase ) and further by translation in ribosomes to proteins .",
    "dna is made up of the four bases @xcite : a(denine ) , g(uanine ) , c(ytosine ) , and t(hymine ) that form the dna ladder structure shown in figure [ dh ] .",
    ", height=290 ]    these building - blocks a , g , c , t bp according to the key - lock principle as a - t and g - c , where the at bond is weaker than the gc bond in terms of stability .",
    "apart from the watson - crick base - pairing energy , the stability of dsdna is effected by the stacking interactions , the specific matching of subsequent bps along the double - strand , i.e. , bp - bp interactions . in standard literature , the stacking interactions are listed for pairs of bps ( e.g. , for at - gc , at - at , at - ta , etc . ) , see below .",
    "based on this agct alphabet , the primary structure of dna can be specified .",
    "dna s six local structural elements twist , tilt , roll , shift , slide , and rise are effected by the stacking interactions between vicinal bps . in figure",
    "[ structure ] , we show a map with the structure elements of the entire _ e.coli _",
    "genome , demonstrating the degree of structural information currently available .",
    "these structural elements define the local geometrical structure of dna within a typical correlation ( persistence ) length of about 150 bps corresponding to 50 nm ( the bp - bp distance measures 3.4  , reflecting the rather complex chemical structure of a nucleotide in comparison to the monomer size of man - made polymers such as polyethylene ) @xcite . on a larger scale , much longer than the persistence length , dna becomes flexible . on this level ,",
    "tertiary structural elements come into play .",
    "one example is dna looping , that is the formation of polymeric lasso loops induced by chemical bonds between binding proteins attached to the dna at specific bps which are remote along the dna backbone @xcite .",
    "an extreme limit of tertiary structure is the packaging of dna onto histones and further wrapping into the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells @xcite . at the same time",
    ", dsdna may locally open into floppy ssdna bubbles , with a persistence length of a few bases .",
    "these fluctuation - induced bubbles increase their statistical weight at higher temperatures , until the dsdna fully denatures ( melts ) .",
    "we will come back to dna denaturation bubbles below . depending on the external conditions",
    ", dna occurs in several configurations . under physiological conditions , one",
    "is concerned with b - dna , but there are other states such as a , b , z , ps , triplex dna , quadruplex dna , cruciform , and h , reviewed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "dna occurs naturally in a large range of length scales . in viruses",
    ", dna is of the order of a few @xmath0 m long . in bacteria",
    ", it already reaches lengths of several mm , and in mammalian cells it can reach the order of a few m , roughly 2 m in a human cell and 35 m in a cell of the south american lungfish , albeit split up into the individual chromosomes @xcite .",
    "dna in bacteria in vivo , or extracted from bacteria and higher cells for our purposes can therefore be viewed a fully flexible polymer with a persistence length of roughly 50 nm , being governed by generic effects independent of the detailed sequence . on short scales dna",
    "becomes semiflexible and governed by the worm - like chain model ( kratky - porod model ) @xcite ; on even shorter scales , local structural elements become important ( in particular , for recognition by binding proteins @xcite ) , and eventually molecular resolution is reached .",
    "stacking interactions govern the local structure of dsdna . globally , an additional constraint arises due to the circular nature of the dna , since it has to satisfy the conservation law @xcite @xmath1 where lk stands for the linking number , tw for the twist , and wr for the writhe of the double helix .",
    "the linking number @xmath2 is an integer and formally given by one - half the number of signed crossings of one dna strand with the other in any regular projection of the molecule .",
    "@xmath2 is a topological property , and no deformation of a closed dna , without breaking and rejoining the dna strands , will alter it .",
    "@xmath3 is equal to the number of times that the two strands of dna wind about the central axis of the molecule , and @xmath4 is a number whose absolute value equals approximately the number of times that the dna axis winds about itself . whereas tw is a property of the double - helical structure of dna",
    ", wr is a property of the dna axis alone .",
    "tw and wr do not need to be integers and are not conserved , but coupled through lk by equation ( [ ltw ] ) .",
    "a nicked circular dna , i.e. , when the twist can fully relax , carries @xmath5 links , where @xmath6 is the number of bp and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 in b - dna ) the number of bps per turn .",

    "the dna of virtually all terrestrial organisms is underwound or _",
    "negatively supercoiled _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath10 ( figures [ wind1 ] and [ wind2 ] ) .",
    "often , the superhelical density @xmath11 is used ; most supercoiled dna molecules isolated from either prokaryotes or eukaryotes have @xmath12 values between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "negative supercoiling is regulated in prokaryotes by dna gyrase ; eukaryotes lack gyrase but maintain negative supercoiling through winding of dna around nucleosomes and interactions with dna - unwinding proteins .",
    "there are two forms of intracellular supercoiling , the _ plectonemic _ form , characteristic of plasmid dna and accessible , nucleosome - free regions of chromatin , and the _ toroidal _ or _",
    "solenoidal _ form , where supercoiling is attained by dna wrapped around histone octamers or prokaryotic non - histone dna - binding proteins ( figure [ wind3 ] ) .",
    "the former is the active form of supercoiled dna and is freely accessible to proteins involved in transcription , replication , recombination and dna repair .",
    "the latter is the stored form of supercoiled dna and is largely responsible for the extraordinary degree of compaction required to condense typical genomes into the cell s nucleus.m and stores the 2 m of the human genome @xcite . ]",
    "negative supercoiling facilitates the local unwinding of dna by providing a ubiquitous source of free energy that augments the unwinding free energy accompanying the interactions of many proteins with their cognate dna sequences .",
    "the local unwinding of dna , in turn , is an integral part of many biological processes such as gene regulation and dna replication ( see section [ generegulation ] ) .",
    "therefore , understanding the interplay of supercoiling and local helical structure is essential to the understanding of biological mechanisms @xcite .",
    "ribonucleic acid ( rna ) consists of the same building blocks as dna , with the exception that t(hymine ) is replaced by u(racile ) @xcite .",
    "rna typically occurs in single - stranded form .",
    "therefore , its secondary structure is richer , being characterised by sequences of hairpins : smaller regions in which chemically remote sequences of bases match , pair and form hairpins which are stiff and energy - dominated , similar to dsdna .",
    "the remaining regions form entropy - dominated floppy loops , analogous to the ssdna bubbles .",
    "additional tertiary structure in rna comes about by the formation of so - called pseudoknots , chemical bonds established between bases sitting on chemically distant segments of the secondary structure . in",
    "rna - modelling the incorporation of pseudoknots is a non - trivial problem , which currently receives considerable interest ; see , for instance , references @xcite .",
    "the formation of dna loops mediated by proteins bound at distant sites along a single molecule is an essential mechanistic aspect of many biological processes including gene regulation , dna replication , and recombination ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . in _",
    ", dna looping represses gene expression at the _ ara _ , _ gal _ , _ lac _ , and _ deo _ operons @xcite and activates transcription from the _",
    "gln_alg operon @xcite .",
    "the size of dna loops formed in these systems varies between approximately 100 and 600 bps . in eukaryotes , a variety of transcription factors bind to enhancers that are hundreds to several thousand bps away from their promoters and interact with rna polymerases directly or through mediators in order to achieve combinatorial gene regulation @xcite .",
    "dna looping is required to juxtapose two recombination sites in intramolecular site - specific recombination @xcite and is also employed by a number of restriction endonucleases such as _ sfi_i and _ ngo_miv , which recognise and cut two copies of well - separated cognate sites simultaneously @xcite . here",
    "we describe a recent statistical - mechanical theory of loop formation that connects global mechanical and geometric properties of both dna and protein and demonstrates the importance of protein flexibility in loop - mediated protein - dna interactions @xcite .",
    "the biological importance of dna loop formation is underscored by the abundance of architectural proteins in the cell such as hu , ihf , and hmg , which facilitate looping by bending the intervening dna between protein - recognition sites @xcite .",
    "moreover , dna looping has been shown to be subject to regulation through the binding of effector molecules that alter protein conformation or protein - dna interactions @xcite .",
    "two characteristics of dna looping have been demonstrated by _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ experiments .",
    "one is cooperative binding of a protein to its two cognate sites , which can be demonstrated by footprinting methods @xcite .",
    "dna looping can increase the occupancies of both binding sites ; in particular , it can significantly enhance protein association to the lower - affinity site because of the tethering effect of dna looping .",
    "this is a general mechanism by which many transcription factors recruit rna polymerases in gene regulation .",
    "another hallmark is the helical dependence of loop formation @xcite , which arises because of dna s limited torsional flexibility and the requirement for correct torsional alignment of the two protein - binding sites .",
    "although many methods have been developed to directly observe dna looping _ in vitro _",
    ", such as scanning - probe @xcite and electron microscopy @xcite , and single - molecule techniques @xcite , assays based on helical dependence have been the only way to identify dna looping _ in vivo_. in these experiments , the dna length between two protein binding sites is varied and the yield of dna loop formation is monitored , for example by the repression or activation of a reporter gene @xcite . using this helical - twist assay , dna looping in the _ ara _",
    "operon was first discovered @xcite .",
    "our knowledge about the roles of dna bending , twist , and their respective energetics in dna looping has come largely from analyses of dna cyclisation @xcite .",
    "circularisation efficiencies of dna fragments , which are quantitatively described by @xmath15-_factors _ , oscillate with dna length and therefore torsional phase @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-factor is defined as the ratio of the partition function of a circularised polymer chain to that of an open chain .",
    "since there is a dimension reduction due to circularisation constraints ( two polymer ends have to meet ) , the ratio has a unit of concentration , or @xmath16 with @xmath17 representing length ; see @xcite for details . in the present context , the @xmath15-factor is equal to the free dna - end concentration whose bimolecular ligation efficiency equals that of the two ends of a cyclising dna molecule @xcite . for short dna fragments @xmath15-factors",
    "are limited by the significant bending and twisting energies required to form closed circles , whereas for long dna , the chain entropy loss during circularisation exceeds the elastic - energy decrease and reduces the @xmath15-factor . because of this competition between bending and twisting energetics and entropy , there is an optimal dna length for cyclisation @xcite .",
    "analogous behaviour has been expected for dna looping , especially with respect to the helical dependence discussed above .",
    "quantitative analyses of dna looping and cyclisation are challenging problems in statistical mechanics and have been largely limited to monte carlo or brownian dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions are available only for some ideal and special cases . an important contribution in this area",
    "is the theory of shimada and yamakawa @xcite , which is based on a homogeneous and continuous elastic rod model of dna .",
    "this theory has been applied extensively to dna cyclisation @xcite and also dna looping @xcite .",
    "the shimada - yamakawa theory makes use of a perturbation approach , in which small configurational fluctuations of a dna chain around the most probable configuration are accounted for in the evaluation of the partition function .",
    "the elastic - equilibrium conformation is obvious for the homogeneous dna circle studied by shimada and yamakawa @xcite .",
    "however , the search for the elastic - energy minimum of homogeneous dna molecules with complex geometry , such as in dna looping , supercoiling , and the case of inhomogeneous dna sequences containing curvature and nonuniform dna flexibility , is not trivial @xcite .",
    "recently , a statistical - mechanical theory for sequence - dependent dna circles has been developed @xcite and applied to the problem of dna cyclisation @xcite and dna looping @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the dna configuration is described by parameters defined at dinucleotide steps , i.e. , tilt , roll , and twist , which allows straightforward incorporation of intrinsic or protein - induced dna curvature at the bp level . following shimada and yamakawa s method ,",
    "the theory first determines the mechanical equilibrium configuration in small dna circles ( i.e. , less than @xmath18 bp ) under certain constraints ; fluctuations around the equilibrium configuration are then taken into account using an harmonic approximation .",
    "the new method is much more computationally efficient than monte carlo simulation , has comparable accuracy , and has been applied successfully to analyse experimental results from dna cyclisation @xcite .",
    "the basis of the extension of the model to dna looping @xcite is to treat the protein subunits as connected rigid bodies and to allow for a limited number of degrees of freedom between the subunits .",
    "motions of the subunits are assumed to be governed by harmonic potentials and an associated set of force constants , neglecting the anharmonic terms often required for proteins undergoing large conformational fluctuations among their modular domains .",
    "indeed , the use of a harmonic approximation is supported by the success of continuum elastic models that are based only on shape and mass - distribution information in descriptions of protein motion @xcite .",
    "similar to the description used for individual dna bps in the model , protein geometry and dynamics are described by three rigid - body rotation angles ( tilt , roll , and twist ) .",
    "therefore , dna looping can be viewed as a generalisation of dna cyclisation in which the protein component is characterised by a particular set of local geometric constraints and elastic constants .",
    "this treatment not only unifies the theoretical descriptions of dna cyclisation and looping , but also allows consideration of flexibilities at protein - dna and protein - protein interfaces and application of the concepts of linking number and writhe . in previous work , proteins were considered rigid and their effects on dna configuration were represented by a set of constraints applied to dna ends @xcite . with the present approach ,",
    "programs developed for analysing dna cyclisation can be used to analyse dna looping with only minor modifications .",
    "the new method @xcite is most applicable to the problem of short dna loops , in which the free energy of a wormlike chain is dominated by bending and torsional elasticity @xcite .",
    "possible modes of dna self contact and contacts between protein and dna at positions other than the binding sites are not considered . for",
    "large loops contributions to the free energy from chain entropy and dna - dna contacts can become highly significant .",
    "several alternative treatments of dna looping have appeared recently .",
    "one of these addresses the excluded - volume contribution to dna looping within large open - circular molecules @xcite , whereas two others consider the effect on looping of traction at the ends of a dna chain @xcite .",
    "none of these treatments includes helical phasing effects on dna looping .",
    "in contrast , a method based on the kirchhoff elastic - rod model , which includes the helical - phase dependence , has been presented @xcite .",
    "however , this approach does not include thermal fluctuations _ per se _ and therefore is not directly applicable to calculations of the @xmath15-factor .",
    "the comprehensive treatment of small dna loops described in @xcite is thus far unique to the extent that it accounts for sequence- and protein - dependent conformational and flexibility parameters , thermal fluctuations , and helical phasing effects .",
    "the protein subunits that mediate loop formation are modelled as two identical and connected rigid bodies , as shown in figure [ loopfig1 ] @xcite .",
    "there are three additional sets of rigid - body rotation angles that are defined in addition to those for dinucleotide steps : two sets for the interfaces between protein and the last ( dp ) and first bps ( pd ) of the dna and one set for the interface between the two protein domains ( pp ) , where the symbols in parentheses are used to indicate the corresponding angles through subscripts .",
    "the local cartesian - coordinate frames for protein subunits are defined such that their origins coincide with vertices of a circular chain and their @xmath19-axes point toward the next vertex in succession .",
    "thus protein dimensions can be modelled in terms of a non - canonical value for the helix rise corresponding to particular segments within a circular polymer chain .    ; the protein - protein twist angle , @xmath20 ; and the protein - dna roll angle , @xmath21 .",

    "the average values of tilt and roll are taken to be zero .      for dna loops with either zero or nonzero end - to - end distances ,",
    "constraints are directly applied to the dna ends , as in the case of dna cyclisation .",
    "we modelled dna loops formed during site synapsis using protein - dependent parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the angle was considered an adjustable parameter that we denote the _ axial angle _ and , unless specified , all other protein - related angular parameters were set equal to @xmath31 . in these cases",
    "the dna ends ( the centres of two protein - binding sites on dna ) are separated by twice the protein - arm length @xmath32 and displaced from one another along the @xmath33 direction , or toward the major groove of dna .",
    "projected along the @xmath34-axis , the axial angle is the included angle between the tangents to the dna at the two protein binding sites and is altered by varying the twist between protein subunits ( figure [ loopfig1 ] b , c ) .",
    "an axial angle equal to @xmath31 corresponds to antiparallel axes at the ends as shown in figure [ loopfig1]a .",

    "the error for end - to - end distances computed using equation ( [ 1 ] ) is less than @xmath52 of dna length from 50 bp to 100 bp , and less than @xmath53 from 100 bp to 500 bp .",
    "the torsional phase angle between two ends is @xmath54 .",
    "the entire loop lies in a plane , and the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the @xmath34-axis of the external coordinate can be shown to be @xmath55 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath56 and @xmath57 suggest that @xmath38 is related to dna bending isotropy .",
    "loop configurations with different @xmath38 values are related to each other by globally twisting dna molecules .",
    "since the orientation of the first bp is fixed , this global twist is equivalent to rotation of the loop plane , which corresponds to the rotational symmetry met in dna cyclisation of homogeneous dna with bending isotropy @xcite . therefore , @xmath15-factors for configurations with different @xmath38 values are identical .",
    "if dna looping needs to be torsionally in - phase , only two degenerate loop configurations are available , breaking the rotational symmetry .",
    "these loop geometries can be expressed by equation ( [ 1 ] ) with two different @xmath38 values : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which satisfy the torsional phase requirement @xmath60 in contrast to dna cyclisation , no twist change is involved in forming these ideal dna loops for any dna length and thus the helical dependence vanishes in this case . from the expression given above for @xmath57",

    "this model of equal loop sizes is equivalent to a completely delocalised knot .",
    "it may therefore be speculated , albeit rather long chain sizes of up to 400 were used , whether the numerical algorithm employed for the simulations in @xcite causes finite - size effects that , in turn , prevent a knot localisation .",

    "while regular rouse behaviour was found for the case of the unknot , the knotted chains displayed somewhat surprising long time contributions to the relaxation time spectrum @xcite , a phenomenon already pointed out by de gennes within an activation argument to create free volume in a tight knot in order to move along the chain @xcite .",
    "note that relatively lose knots in shorter chains do not appear to exhibit such extremely long relaxation time behaviour @xcite .",
    "simulation of a 3d knot with varying excluded volume showed , if only the excluded volume becomes large enough , the gyration radius of the knot is independent of the knot type @xcite .",
    "the picture of tight knots is further corroborated in the study by katritch _",

    "apart from determining the statistical quantities @xmath121 and @xmath185 from simulations , there also exist indirect methods for quantifying the size of the knot region in a knotted polymer .",
    "one such method is to confine an open chain containing a knot between two walls , and measuring the finite size corrections of the force - extension curve due to the knot size .",
    "this is based on the idea that the gyration radius for a system depending on more than one length scale ( i.e. , apart from the chain length @xmath6 ) shows above mentioned confluent corrections , such that @xcite @xmath202 when only the largest correction is considered , and in 3d @xmath203 is supposed to be universal @xcite .",

    "an argument in favour of this approach is the consistency of the exponent @xmath213 with the inferred @xmath214 , which is close to the known value .",
    "note that the force - extension of a chain with a slip - link was discussed in reference @xcite and shown that a loop separated off by a slip - link is confined within a pincus - de gennes blob .",
    "we also note that results corresponding to delocalisation in force - size relations were reported in @xcite .",
    "an entropic scale was conceived in @xcite : separating two chains with fixed topology but allowing them to exchange length ( e.g. , through a small hole in a wall ) would enable one to infer the localisation behaviour of a knot by comparing the equilibrium balance of this knot with a slip - link construct of known degrees of freedom until the average length on both sides coincides .",
    "the preliminary results in @xcite are shadowed by finite - size effects of the accessible system size , as limited by computation power .",
    "the analysis in reference @xcite of a self - avoiding polygon model uses the method of closure of a short fragment of the knot and subsequent determination of its alexander polynomial to obtain the scaling exponent @xmath215 ; in a second variant , the authors find a consistent result by a variant of the knot scale method .",
    "another recent study uses a more realistic model for a polymer chain , namely , a simplified model of polyethylene ; with up to 1000 monomers in the simulation , the exponent @xmath216 is found ( and delocalisation is obtained in the dense phase ) @xcite .    thus , there exist simulations results pointing in both directions , knot localisation and delocalisation . as the latter",
    "may be explained by finite size effects , it seems likely that ( at least simple ) knots in 2d and 3d localise in the sense that the knot region occupies a portion of the chain that is significantly smaller in comparison to the entire chain . in particular",
    ", this would imply that the average size of the knot region @xmath217 scales with the chain length @xmath218 with an exponent less than one , such that @xmath219 below , we show from analytical grounds that such a localisation is a natural consequence of interactions of a chain of fixed topology with fluctuations .",
    "we note , however , that conclusive results for knot localisation may in fact come from experiments : manipulation of single chains such as dna can be performed for rather long chains , making it possible to reach beyond the finite - size corrections inherent in , e.g. , the force - extension simulations mentioned above . the aforementioned afm studies on single dna knots indeed reveal knot localisation of flattened knots @xcite ; due to experimental limitations , presently only one dna length was investigated , such that the scaling exponent @xmath220 currently can not be obtained .    before proceeding to these analytical approaches ,",
    "we note that there have also been performed simulations of knotted chains under non - dilute conditions @xcite . in ( pseudo ) 2d , these have found delocalisation of the knot , i.e. , @xmath221 .",

    ". a segment of a 3d knot , in other words , can move without feeling the constraints due to the non - trivial topology of a knotted state , until it actually collides with another segment .",

    "however , some insight can be gained on the basis of phenomenological models , which we will come back to below . here , we continue with an analytical study of flat knots .",
    "one possibility to treat knotted polymer chains analytically is to confine the degrees of freedom of the knot to motion in 2d , only .",
    "the knot , that is , is preserved , as at the crossings the chain is allowed to form an over-/underpassing , while the rest of the knot is confined to 2d .",

    "thus , the chain can be confined between two close - by glass slabs , as demonstrated in @xcite ; it can be pressed flat on a surface by gravitation or similar forces , for instance in macroscopic systems @xcite ; the chain can be adhesively bound to a membrane and still reach configurational equilibrium , as experimentally shown for dna in references @xcite . or it can be adsorbed to a mica surface either by aptes coating or by providing bivalent mg ions in solution , as shown in figure [ valle ] . from such flat knots as discussed in the remainder of this section , we will be able to infer certain generic features also for 3d knots .    ]",
    "a flat knot therefore corresponds to a polymer network in 2d , but the orientation of the crossings is preserved , such that the network graph actually coincides with a typical knot projection @xcite , as shown in figure [ tref_proj ] on the left .",
    "this projection of the trefoil , and similar projections for all knots , displays the knot with the essential crossings . a flat knot can ,",
    "in principle acquire an arbitrary number of crossings by reidemeister moves ; for instance , the bottom left segment of the flat trefoil can slide under the vicinal segment , creating a new pair of vertices , and so on . however",
    ", we suppose that such transient additional loops are sufficiently short - lived so that we can neglect them in our analysis .",
    "then , we can apply results from scaling analysis of polymer networks of the most general type shown in figure [ network ] , see the primer in the appendix .",
    "we note that from the monte carlo simulations we performed it may be concluded that such additional vertices can in fact be neglected .",

    "let @xmath227 be the total length of all segments contained in the multiply connected knot region .",
    "accordingly , the length of the large loop is @xmath228 .    in the limit @xmath161",

    "putting numerical values , we find @xmath236 , i.e. , _",
    "strong localisation_.        however , some care is necessary in performing these integrations , since the scaling function @xmath237 may exhibit non - integrable singularities if one or more of the arguments @xmath238 tend to @xmath239 . the geometries corresponding to these limits ( edges of the configuration hyperspace ) represent _ contractions _ of the original trefoil network @xmath240 in the sense that the length of one or more of the segments @xmath225 is of the order of the short - distance cutoff @xmath114 .",
    "if such a short segment connects different vertices , they can not be resolved on larger length scales , but appear as a single , new vertex .",

    "there exist six different contractions , as grouped in figure [ knot_zoo ] around the original flat trefoil at position iii . as an example , in the top row of figure [ knot_zoo ] contraction vi follows from the original trefoil iii if the uppermost segment becomes very small , and similarly the network vii emanates from contraction vi if one of the four symmetric segments becomes very small . for each of these networks",

    "to lowest order , the trefoil behaves like a large ring polymer at whose fringe the point - like knot region is located . at the next level of resolution , it appears contracted to the figure - eight shape @xmath247 . for more accurate data ,",
    "the higher order shapes ii to vii may be found with decreasing probability .",
    "interestingly , the original uncontracted trefoil configuration ranks third in the hierarchy of shapes .",

    "configurations corresponding to contraction i are then selected by requiring that besides a large loop , they contain only one segment larger than a preset cutoff length ( taken to be 5 monomers ) , and similarly for contraction ii .",

    "the more traditional way to determine the stacking interactions is by fit of bulk melting curves of dna constructs containing exclusively pairs of the specific bp - bp combination such as @xmath304 ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the free energy used in this automated fit procedure using the meltsim algorithm @xcite , @xmath305 combines the stacking enthalpy difference @xmath306 for both hydrogen bond and actual stacking energies , and the entropy difference @xmath307 chosen to explicitly depend on the nature of the broken bp . a recent alternative to determine the stability parameters of dna",
    "was developed in the group of frank - kamenetskii , leading to the free energy @xcite @xmath308 where the gibbs free energies @xmath309 and @xmath310 measure the stacking of bps @xmath34 and @xmath301 and the hydrogen bonding of bp @xmath34 _ including _ the entropy release on disruption .",
    "note that @xmath310 is chosen such that it only depends on the broken bp and has two values for at and gc bps , irrespective of the orientation ( 3 or 5 ) .",

    "the difference between the two approaches becomes apparent when we consider the initiation of a bubble , i.e. , a denatured coil enclosed by intact double - helix .",
    "now , the partition function for a bubble with left fork position at @xmath312 and consisting of @xmath299 broken bps , @xmath313 differs from ( [ endpart ] ) in three respects : ( i ) while the bubble consists of @xmath299 molten bps , @xmath314 stacking interactions need to be broken to create two boundaries between intact double - strand and the single - strand in the bubble ; the extra stacking interaction is effectively incorporated into @xmath315 .",

    "rna polymerase binds at the promoter region consisting of some 60 bps close to the beginning of the gene .",
    "it then converts the a , t , g , c code of the gene into a complementary messenger rna ( from which , in turn , the protein is produced during translation ) .",
    "the stop of transcription is triggered by a certain sequence at the end of the gene .",
    "depending on specific conditions of the recruitment by regulatory proteins , rna polymerase binding to the promoter of a certain gene is either blocked ( the gene is off ) , facilitated ( high binding affinity of rna polymerase due to the ( simultaneous ) presence of certain protein(s ) ) , or basal ( in absence of any bound regulatory protein , rna polymerase can still have a minor affinity to the promoter and then autonomously start transcription ) .",

    "molecular switches such as the @xmath108 switch are surprisingly stable against noise , despite the fact that there are only about 100 repressor dimers in the entire bacteria cell @xcite .",
    "thus , apart from external induction , lysis occurs by spontaneous induction due to absence of ci from the operators @xcite .",
    "such noise - induced errors are estimated to occur once in @xmath434 cell generations @xcite .",
    "the stability of the @xmath108 switch against noise was analysed in terms of a wentzell - freidlin approach @xcite and by a simulation analysis @xcite .",
    "the latter confirmed that the currently known molecular mechanisms used in modelling the @xmath108 switch appear sufficient .",

    "[ bakk],width=325 ]      given their very specific function , dna - binding proteins must recognise a specific ( cognate ) sequence of nucleotides along the genome .",
    "in fact , without opening the double helix , the outside of the dna can be read by proteins , as the edge of each bp is exposed at the surface .",
    "these patterns are unique only in the major groove of the dna , this being the reason why gene regulatory proteins generally bind to the major groove . apart from single bp pattern recognition , the protein binding is sensitive to the special surface features of a certain dna region .",
    "this local structure of dna needs to be complementary to the protein structure .",
    "typical structure patterns ( motifs ) include helix - turn - helix , zinc fingers , leucine zipper , and helix - loop - helix motifs @xcite . in bacteria ,",
    "typical dna - binding proteins cover some 20 bps or less .",
    "for instance , the lac repressor has a cognate sequence of 21 base pairs , the cap protein 16 , and the @xmath108 repressor ci 17 bps @xcite .",
    "although the interaction with a single nucleotide within such a dna - protein bond is relatively weak , the sum of all matching nucleotides reaches appreciable values for the overall binding enthalpy , see below .",
    "moreover , regulatory proteins bound simultaneously can significantly enhance the stability of their individual bonds .",
    "a simple model for the binding interaction goes back to the work of berg and von hippel @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the binding free energy is comprised of two contributions : ( i ) the ( average ) non - specific binding free energy due to electrostatic interaction with the dna ; and ( ii ) additional binding free energy if the sequence of the binding site is sufficiently close to the best ( perfectly matching ) sequence .",
    "the transition to the non - specific binding is supposed to occur via a conformational change of the regulatory protein from one that allows more hydrogen bond - formation to another that permits closer contact between the positive charges of the binding protein to the negatively charged dna backbone @xcite .",
    "this is supported by more recent structural studies : while in the non - specific binding mode the lac repressor is bound to dna in a rather loose and fuzzy way @xcite , it appears much more ordered in the specific mode .",
    "in fact , in the latter the protein induces a bend in the dna @xcite . in case ( ii ) , the additional binding free energy can , to good approximation , be considered independent and additive .",
    "reference @xcite provides a review of these issues , and derives the following result . accordingly , to satisfy both the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints of the dna - binding protein interaction , each additional base mismatch in comparison to the best sequence amounts to the loss of roughly 2 @xmath435 , and the optimal value for the transition between best specific binding to the cognate site and non - specific binding is shown to be some 16 @xmath435 below the energy of the best binding .",
    "this value is quite close to the @xmath436 @xmath435 found for the difference between specific and nonspecific binding in @xcite .",
    "the fact that regulatory proteins bind with varying affinity is an important ingredient in gene regulation : not all promoters should have the same activity , because some proteins are required by the cell at much higher levels than others . thus ,",
    "one given regulatory protein , that controls the recruitment to the promoters of several genes , can act with different strength depending on the degree of matching with the local sequence .",
    "non - specific binding can become quite appreciable .",
    "it was discovered in reference @xcite that in the case of the lac repressor less than 10% of the proteins were unbound . in a more recent study using in vivo data of the @xmath108 switch",
    ", it was found that in a lysogen nearly 90% of the repressor protein ci is non - specifically bound .",

    "the corresponding non - specific binding energies were estimated as 7 @xmath435 @xcite .",
    "we note that in contrast to regulatory proteins , restriction enzymes have an approximate all - or - nothing matching condition : if a defined sequence matches the restriction enzyme , it will cut , otherwise not .",
    "even a single mismatch reduces the action of the restriction enzyme by orders of magnitude .",
    "this distinction from regulatory protein makes sense as restriction enzymes are survival mechanisms and should not just cut the cell s own dna @xcite .",

    ".,width=302 ]    to find their specific ( cognate ) binding site along the genome , dna - binding proteins such as restriction enzymes or transcription factors have to search megabases along the dna molecule .",
    "the high accuracy of gene expression control by binding proteins such as in the @xmath108-switch requires a fast search and recognition of the target sequence by the proteins .",
    "a simple 3-dimensional ( 3d ) search of the target sequence by the proteins is not sufficient to explain experimentally measured target search rates .",
    "it has been suggested relatively early @xcite that additional search mechanisms such as 1d sliding along the genome are needed to account for the actual efficiency of the search process . in their pioneering work ,",
    "berg , von hippel and coworkers established a statistical model for target search comprising the four fundamental steps , as shown in figure [ fig : ownmechanisms ] : ( i ) 3d macrohops during which the protein fully detaches from the genome until after a volume excursion it rebinds to the dna ( as a good approximation , the landing site on the dna after a macrohop can be assumed to be equidistributed and uncorrelated ) ; ( ii ) microhops during which the protein detaches from the dna but always stays very close to it ( i.e. , the microhop takes place within a cylinder whose radius corresponds to the escape distance of the protein from the dna , see @xcite ) ; ( iii ) 1d sliding along the genome ( while preserving a certain bonding to the dna due to nonspecific binding ) ; and ( iv ) intersegmental jumps . the latter",
    "are mediated by dna - loops bringing two chemically remote segments of the dna close in euclidean space , see , for instance , @xcite and references therein .",
    "a protein like lac repressor , which can establish bonds to two different stretches of dsdna simultaneously , can then jump from one to the neighbouring segment .",
    "this process might lead to a paradoxical diffusion behaviour @xcite .",
    "however , if the conformational changes in the dna are not too slow , both the bulk mediated macrohops and the intersegmental transfer lead to fast mixing of the enzymes positions along the chain ( as it was shown for the related problem in @xcite ) , and on the mean - field level can be described by a desorption followed by the absorption at a random place .",
    "recently , there has been renewed interest in the targeting problem , both theoretically ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and experimentally ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including single molecule studies @xcite . despite the extensive knowledge of specific binding rates and both specific and non - specific binding free energies , the precise relative contributions of the different search mechanisms ( and , to some extent ,",
    "also the stringent criteria to define these four elementary interactions ) are not fully resolved .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that under tight(er ) binding conditions , the sliding of the protein becomes subdiffusive due to the local structure landscape of a heteropolymer dna @xcite .",
    "this complication , however , is expected to be relaxed in a more loosely bound search mode of the searching protein @xcite .",
    "we here adopt the latter view of normal diffusion , which is corroborated by the experimental study in the next subsection .      in previous studies ,",
    "the 1d sliding problem had always been considered as a problem of 3d diffusion which is enhanced by 1d diffusion .",
    "thus , workers such as berg , winter , and von hippel @xcite assumed that proteins nonspecifically bound would on average unbind before finding their specific binding sites .",
    "this results in an enhancement of specific binding rates that is proportional to the 1d sliding rate , but the overall specific binding rate depends linearly on protein concentration .",
    "these studies neglect the possibility that the protein finds its specific site before unbinding . given the experimental conditions under which transcription factor binding has been previously studied , this approximation is appropriate .",
    "however , as demonstrated in @xcite , this mechanism , in which the unbinding rate is much lower than the specific binding rate , occurs for the 1d search of dna by the single - stranded dna binding protein t4 gene 32 protein ( gp32 ) .",
    "this fast 1d search rate is essential for gp32 to be able to quickly find specific locations on dna molecules that are undergoing replication , and which have large sections of single - stranded dna exposed for gp32 binding .",
    "the resulting nonlinear concentration dependence of gp32 binding will likely have significant effects on gp32 s ability to find its replication sites as well as its ability to recruit other proteins during replication .",
    "if these nonlinear effects also occur for tfs , this characteristic will strongly affect regulatory processes governed by protein binding .     in 1/s as function of protein concentration @xmath197 in m , for parameters corresponding to 100 mm salt .",

    "a more detailed study of different regimes of dna is under way .",
    "viruses have played an important role in the discovery of the mechanisms underlying gene regulation , see , for instance , reference @xcite . from a nanoscience perspective , viruses are of interest on their own part . during the assembly of many viruses , the viral dna of several @xmath0 m length is packaged into the capsid , the protein container making up most of the virus , by a motor protein . this motor packages the dna by exerting forces of up to 60 pn or more , causing pressures building up in the capsid of the order of 6 mpa @xcite .",
    "the size of the capsid spans few tens of @xmath0 m , and is therefore comparable to the persistence length of dna @xcite .",
    "therefore , fluctuation - based undulations are suppressed , and the chain can be approximately thought of as being wound up helically like thread on a bobbin , or like a ball of yarn .",
    "ultimately , a relatively highly ordered 3d configuration of the dna inside the capsid is achieved , which under certain conditions may even lead to local crystallisation of the dna @xcite .",
    "it is generally argued that this ordered arrangement helps to avoid the creation of entanglements or even knots of the wound - up dna , thus enabling easy ejection , i.e. , release of the dna once the phage docks to a new host cell ; this ejection is not assisted by the packaging motor , but it can be facilitated by host cellular dna polymerase , which starts to transcribe the dna and thereby pulls it out of the capsid @xcite .",
    "details on the packaging energetics can be found in reference @xcite , and the works cited therein .",
    "model calculations for the entropy loss , binding and twist energy , and electrostatic forces that need to be overcome on packaging reveal , that at higher packaging ratios the packaging force almost exclusively comes from the electrostatic repulsion .",
    "complex molecules can be endowed with the distinct feature that they contain subunits which are linked to each other mechanically rather than chemically @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the structure and properties of such interlocked _ topological molecules _ is subject of the growing field of chemical topology @xcite ; while speculations about the possibility of catenanes ( olympic rings ) date back to the early 20th century lectures of willsttter , the actual synthesis of catenanes and rotaxanes succeeded in 1958 @xcite .",
    "modern organic chemistry has seen the development of refined synthesis methods to generate topological molecules .      in parallel to the miniaturisation in electronics @xcite and the possibility of manipulating single ( bio)molecules @xcite , supramolecular chemistry which makes use of chemical topology properties is coming of age @xcite .",
    "thus , rotaxane - type molecules are believed to be the building blocks for certain nanoscale machines and motors @xcite , so - called hermaphrodite molecules have been shown to perform linear relative motion ( `` contraction and stretching '' ) @xcite , and pirouetting molecules have been synthesised @xcite . moreover",
    ", topological molecules are thought to become components for molecular electronics switching devices in memory and computing applications @xcite .",
    "these molecular machines are usually of lower molecular weight , and their behaviour is essentially energy - dominated in the sense that their conformations and dynamical properties are governed by external and thermal activation in an energy landscape .",
    "the understanding of the physical properties and the theoretical modelling of such designer molecules and their natural biological counterparts has increasingly gained momentum , and the stage is already set for the next generation of applications @xcite .    in reference",
    "@xcite we introduced some basic concepts for functional molecules whose driving force is entropic rather than energetic , see also the more recent publications in chemistry journals @xcite .",
    "entropy - functional molecules will be of higher molecular weight ( hundred monomers or above ) in order to provide sufficient degrees of freedom such that entropic effects can determine the behaviour of the molecule .",
    "the potential for such _ entropy - driven functional molecules _ can be anticipated from the classical gibbs free energy @xmath484 in functional molecules , @xmath485 is minimised mainly by variation of the internal energy @xmath486 representing the shape of the energy landscape of the functional unit .",
    "new types of molecules were proposed for which @xmath485 is minimised by variations of the entropy @xmath487 , while the energies and chemical bondings are left unchanged @xcite .",
    "the entropy - functional units of such molecules can be specifically controlled by external parameters like temperature , light flashes , or other electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we note that dna is already being studied as a macromolecular prototype building block for molecular machines @xcite .",
    "a typical example is the molecule shown in figure [ muscle ] . according to the arrangement of the sliding rings 1 and 2",
    ", this compound exhibits the unique feature of a molecule that it can slide _",
    "laterally_. suggested as precursors of molecular muscles @xcite , this compound could be propelled with internal entropy - motors , which entropically adjust the elongation of the muscle . in the configuration shown in figure [ muscle ] , the sliding ring 3 creates , if activated , an entropic force which tends to contract the `` muscle '' ; at @xmath488 and on a typical scale @xmath489 , the entropic force @xmath490 is of the order of pn , and thus comparable to the force created in biological muscle cells @xcite .",
    "molecular muscles of such a make can be viewed as the nano - counterpart of macroscopic muscle models proposed by de gennes @xcite , in which the contraction is based on the entropy difference between the isotropic and nematic phases in liquid crystalline elastomer films @xcite .",
    "similarly , one might speculate whether the dna helix - coil transition @xcite in multiplication setups could be facilitated in the presence of pre - ring molecules which in vitro attach to an opened loop of the double strand and close , creating an entropy pressure which tends to open up the vicinal parts of the dna which are still in the helix state .",
    "finally , considering molecular motors , it would be interesting to design an externally controllable , purely entropy - driven rotating nanomotor .",
    "numerous additional nanoapplications of biopolymers appear in current literature .",
    "an interesting example is the nanomotor created by a dna ring in a periodically driven external field , for instance , a focused light beam inducing localised temperature variations @xcite .",
    "the speeds possibly attained by such a device are of the order of those reached by biological organisms .",
    "such a nanorotor could be used to stir smallest volumes in higher viscous environments .",
    "the advances in minituarization of reactors and devices also brings along the need of probes , by which smallest volumes can be tested .",
    "for instance , microarrays used in genomics require sensors to detect the presence of certain proteins ( often at small concentrations ) in a microdish , without disturbing the environment in the small volume too much .",
    "similarly , single molecule experiments require specific local detection possibilities .",
    "a fine example for a potential nanosensore is the blinking behaviour of a fluorophore - quencher pair mounted on the denaturation wedge as shown in figure [ beacon ] .",
    "this setup , similar to the ones described in references @xcite works as follows .",
    "as long as the dsdna is intact , fluorophore and quencher are in close proximity .",
    "once they come apart from one another when the denaturation wedge opens up , the incident laser light causes fluorescence of the dye .",
    "the on / off blinking of this `` molecular beacon '' can be monitored in the focus of a confocal microscope , or , depending on the intensity of the emitted light , by a digital camera .",
    "the blinking renders immediate information about the state of the bp , that is tagged by the dye - quencher pair .",
    "fluorescence , that is , indicates that the bp is currently broken .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to define the random variable @xmath353 with the property @xmath491 and in experiments one typically measures the corresponding blinking autocorrelation function @xmath492 where @xmath493 is the ( ensemble ) equilibrium value , or its spectral decomposition @xmath494 where @xmath495 is called the relaxation time spectrum .",
    "figure [ blinkbeac ] shows an example for the achievable sensitivity of such nanobeacons , in an example where the denaturation wedge is in solution together with a certain concentration ( proportional to @xmath430 , compare sec .",
    "ivg ) of selectively single - stranded dna binding proteins , as discussed previously .",
    "it is distinct how both measurable signals , @xmath496 and @xmath369 change with varying ssb - concentration .",
    "biopolymers such as dna , rna , and proteins are indispensable for their specificity and robustness in all forms of life . given their detailed physical properties such as dna s persistence length of some 50 nm or its local denaturation in nano - bubbles already at room temperature , and biochemically relevant interfaces such as 10 - 20 bps , they deeply stretch into the nanoscience domain .",
    "this statement is twofold in the following sense .",
    "firstly , nanotechniques such as atomic force microscopes become important tools to manipulate and probe biomolecules and their interaction even on the single molecule level . secondly , biomolecules are entering the stage as nanotools such as nanosensors , functional molecules , or highly sensitive force transducers .",
    "the possibility to perform controlled experiments on biomolecules , for instance , to measure the force - extension curves of single biopolymers , also opens up novel possibilities to test new physical theories .",
    "the foremost examples may be the exploration of persistence lengths and other polymer physics properties , and the statistical mechanical concepts relevant for small system sizes .",
    "the latter are known under the keyword of the jarzynski relation connecting the non - equilibrium work performed on a physical system with the difference in the thermodynamic ( i.e. , equilibrium ) potential between initial and final states @xcite . however , there exist by now several similar theories addressing different physical quantities , such as the concept of entropy production along a single particle trajectory @xcite .",
    "this review summaries fundamental physical properties of dna , and their relevance for both biological processes and technological applications",
    ". the extensive list of references will be useful for further studies on specific topics covered herein .",
    "we are confident that the role of biomolecules in technology , not at least for biomedical applications , will experience a dramatic increase during the coming years and will enable us to extend current physical understanding of fundamental processes .",

    "in this section , we introduce some basic concepts from polymer physics . starting from the random walk model",
    ", we define the fundamental measures of a polymer chain , before introducing excluded volume . for more details",
    ", we refer to the monographs @xcite .",
    "the simplest polymer model is due to orr @xcite .",
    "it models the polymer chain a a random walk on a periodic lattice with lattice spacing @xmath114 .",
    "then , each monomer of index @xmath45 is characterised by a position vector @xmath497 with @xmath498 .",
    "the distance between monomers @xmath45 and @xmath499 is called @xmath500 . consequently , the end - to - end vector of the polymer is @xmath501 different @xmath502 have completely independent orientations , such that we immediately obtain the average ( @xmath503 over different configurations ) squared end - to - end distance @xmath504 @xmath505 is a measure for the size of the random walk .",
    "an alternative measure of the size of a polymer chain is provided by its radius of gyration @xmath121 , which may be measured by light scattering experiments .",
    "it is defined by @xmath506 and measures the average squared distance to the centre of gravity , @xmath507 expression ( [ appgyr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath508 with @xmath509 , one can easily show that @xmath510 $ ] . for large @xmath6 ,",
    "that is , @xmath511 , and therefore : @xmath512    on a cubic lattice in @xmath116 dimensions , each step can go in @xmath513 directions , and for a general lattice , each vector @xmath502 will have @xmath0 possible directions .",
    "the number of distinct walks with @xmath6 steps is therefore @xmath131 .",
    "denote @xmath514 the number of distinct walks with end - to - end vector @xmath515 , the probability density function for a given @xmath515 is @xmath516 for large @xmath6 , due to the independence of individual @xmath502 , this probability density function will acquire a gaussian shape , @xmath517 where the normalisation is such that @xmath518 . from this expression",
    ", we can deduce that the number of degrees of freedom of a closed random walk chain is proportional to @xmath519 , the entropy loss suffered by a chain subject to the constraint @xmath520 . on a general lattice ,",
    "@xmath521 with the connectivity constant @xmath0 , a measure for in how many different directions the next bond vector can point ( @xmath130 in a cubic lattice ) . at fixed end - to - end distance , the entropy of the random walk becomes @xmath522 where @xmath523 absorbs all constants .",
    "for the free energy @xmath524 we therefore obtain @xmath525 i.e. , the random walk likes to coil , the restoring force @xmath526 being linear in @xmath515 .",
    "this is often called the entropic spring character of a gaussian polymer .",
    "note that the ` spring constant ' increases with temperature ( ` entropy elasticity ' ) .    in this random walk model of a polymer chain , it is straightforward to define the persistence length of the chain . by this",
    "we mean that successive vectors @xmath502 are not independent , but tend to be parallel . over long distance , this correlation is lost , and the chain behaves like a random walk . due to the quantum chemistry of the monomers , an adjacent pair of vectors @xmath527 includes preferred angles , for carbon chains leading to the trans / gauche configurations .",
    "this feature is captured schematically in the freely rotating chain as depicted in figure [ fjc ] .      following @xcite",
    ", we can obtain the correlation @xmath528 as follows .",
    "if we fix all vectors @xmath529 , then the average @xmath530 .",
    "multiplication by @xmath531 produces @xmath532 averaging over the @xmath533 leads to the recursion relation @xmath534 . with the initial condition @xmath535 , we find @xmath536 thus , if @xmath537 , we obtain a rigid rod behaviour , while for @xmath538 , there occurs an exponential decay of the correlation between any two bond vectors @xmath539 and @xmath531 .",
    "this defines a length scale @xmath540 the ` persistence length ' of the chain .",
    "it diverges for @xmath541 , while for @xmath542 , it vanishes , corresponding to the random walk model discusses above ( ` freely jointed chain ' ) . as @xmath543",
    "we find @xmath544 , i.e. , statistically , the freely jointed chain behaves the same as the random walk chain , but with a rescaled monomer length . the statistical unit in a polymer chain is often taken to be the kuhn length @xmath545 .",
    "above chain models are often referred to as being phantom , i.e. , the chain can freely cross itself .",
    "a physical polymer possesses an excluded volume and behaves like a so - called self - avoiding chain .",
    "mathematically , this can be modelled by self - avoiding walks .",
    "to include the major effects , it is sufficient to follow a simple argument due to flory .",
    "consider a chain with unknown radius @xmath546 and internal monomer concentration @xmath547 . assuming that the self - avoiding character is due to monomer - monomer interactions , the repulsive energy is proportional to the squared concentration , i.e. , @xmath548 with the excluded volume parameter @xmath549 ( @xmath550 in flory s notation , where the @xmath455 condition @xmath551 corresponds to ideal chain behaviour ) . to obtain the total averaged repulsive energy @xmath552 , we need to average over @xmath553 . in a mean field approach ,",
    "we take @xmath554 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath555 favouring large values of @xmath546 .",
    "this ` swelling ' competes with the entropic elasticity contribution @xmath556 .",
    "the total free energy becomes @xmath557 with a minimum at @xmath558 , so that the flory radius scales like @xmath559 the values of the exponent @xmath560 and @xmath561 are extremely close to the best known values @xmath562 and @xmath180 .",
