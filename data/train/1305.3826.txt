    "at the present time , nearly all massive galaxies contain supermassive ( @xmath8 ) black holes ( bhs ) at their center .",
    "the formation mechanism of the seeds for these bhs is not known .",
    "they may have formed from the death of the first , massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , from the direct collapse of gas clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or in the centers of dense stellar clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "whatever the mechanism , we know that in some cases the seed bhs were able to gain mass quickly to form massive quasars at @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additional insight into the formation of the first bhs comes from looking for the least massive bhs in the universe today .",
    "these are , in some sense ,  left - over  seed bhs .",
    "a study of their number density , mass distribution , and host - galaxy properties can in principle isolate the primary seed formation mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    unfortunately , low - mass bhs ( @xmath10@xmath11  @xmath12 ) are difficult to study since they tend to live in faint galaxies .",
    "even when active , the bhs are faint , rarely reaching their eddington luminosity ( @xmath13  erg  s@xmath3 for a @xmath14 bh ) . the first indication of a population of low - mass bhs in late - type galaxies came from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) discovered in ngc  4395 @xcite , which is thought to harbor a @xmath15  @xmath12  bh @xcite .",
    "the rediscovery of the agn in pox 52 , also thought to harbor a @xmath15  @xmath12bh @xcite , inspired a number of more systematic searches for bhs in this low - mass range .",
    "systematic searches through the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have uncovered more than one hundred bhs with @xmath16  @xmath12  @xcite .",

    "we are beginning to study the accretion properties @xcite and the distribution of host properties for these samples @xcite . on the other hand , because of severe bias in the optical selection of these objects , it is prohibitive to calculate a robust space density for them ( see review in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alternate search strategies are needed that circumvent strong optical bias toward luminous host galaxies and high - eddington ratio sources .",
    "techniques using x - rays or mid - infrared spectroscopy have utilized very small samples to date @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", very deep x - ray surveys now exist that reach depths capable of probing the intermediate - mass regime for bhs .",
    "for instance , the central area of the chandra deep field - south survey reaches depths ( up to 4 ms ) capable of uncovering @xmath17 bhs with @xmath18/@xmath19 as low as @xmath20 out to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "so far , most studies of the agn population in these deep - survey fields have focused on either the high - redshift luminous population or those hidden by obscuration .",
    "recently , @xcite find that there is a significant fraction of relatively low - mass galaxies that host highly obscured agns at @xmath22 , which contribute to the unresolved 6 - 8 kev cosmic x - ray background .",
    "these surveys enable searches for accreting bhs in small stellar mass systems that are not biased by host - galaxy mass .",
    "furthermore , such surveys have remarkable multiwavelength data that greatly facilitate our understanding of the building blocks of the more massive quasars and their host galaxies .",
    "we use x - ray observations from the chandra deep field - south survey and its extended coverage to search for faint agns within the low - mass ( @xmath23 ) galaxy population .",

    "stellar masses are determined from the galaxy absolute magnitude @xmath28 and rest - frame color @xmath29 as measured from hst imaging , following the prescription of @xcite .",

    "the galaxy cut - off mass we choose is somewhat arbitrary , but does focus on a stellar - mass regime where only a few agns are already known [ see , e.g. , figure 1 of @xcite ; note the @xmath32 cutoff line in their figure 1 ] . specifically , low - mass black holes found through optical selection using the sdss @xcite are typically found in higher mass galaxies with stellar masses of a few times @xmath33 @xmath34 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar - mass regime below @xmath35 @xmath34 has yielded essentially no agns in optically - selected searches @xcite .",
    "also , based on a naive extrapolation of the bh - to - bulge mass relation of @xcite , these galaxies are likely to harbor a black hole with @xmath36 @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the upper limit on the stellar mass of the parent galaxy population focuses our search for low - mass black holes at the low - mass end of the blue cloud , a region of parameter space in the color - mass plane ( see figure  [ fig : cm ] ) where galaxies are likely to be forming stars rapidly .",
    "multi - wavelength catalogs of x - ray sources in the cdf - s @xcite provide robust matches to optical counterparts , including low - mass galaxies , based upon a likelihood - ratio matching routine .",
    "we find 27 galaxies with @xmath37 , @xmath38  @xmath12 , and an x - ray detection .",

    "[ fig : optical ] , we show postage - stamp hst / acs images of the three low - mass galaxies while indicating the x - ray centroid and an effective search radius for an optical counterpart that demonstrates the likelihood of these associations . in the remainder of this paper , we combine the _ hst _ imaging ( figure  [ fig : optical ] ) , the optical spectroscopy from keck / deimos @xcite and vlt / vimos @xcite ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) , and the broad - band sed to argue that each of these sources is a viable candidate to host a low - mass agn (  3 ) .",
    "we present our case that these three x - ray detected galaxies are most naturally explained as being powered by accretion onto a massive black hole .",
    "there are many other processes that lead to x - ray emission from galaxies , including an unresolved contribution of low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries or thermal emission from hot gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the high - mass x - ray binary population is likely to contribute significantly to those galaxies with high sfrs .",

    "we first show that our candidates have excess x - ray emission compared to that expected from early - type galaxies based on their optical continuum luminosities and then we show that the sources have even more anomalous x - ray luminosity given their inferred sfrs . in figure",

    "although xid-312 is just above our selection criteria in the @xmath50 plane , the galaxy has been reported to be x - ray variable in the recent study by @xcite , who concluded that the observed variability can not be due to binary populations or ultraluminous sources but rather is best explained by an accreting black hole .",
    "its x - ray hardness ratio , defined as hr=(h - s)/(h+s ) , where s and h are the soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and hard ( 2 - 8 kev ) band net counts is hr=-0.2 @xcite .",
    "the observed hardness ratio suggests some absorption by neutral gas with a density of about @xmath51 ( see figure 9 in * ? ? ?",

    "now we turn to the optical line emission , ( see figure [ fig : spectra ] ) for additional clues as to the nature of these sources .",
    "we use traditional emission - line ratio diagnostics ( e.g. , kewley et al .",
    "2006 ) to determine the dominant source of photo - ionization in these galaxies ( agn activity or star formation ) .",
    "we perform a line - fitting routine to measure the strengths of the emission lines .",
    "we first fit the spectrum with a low - order polynomial to model the continuum adjacent to the emission line and then subtract it from the spectrum . in the cases of xid-476 and xid-231 , we do not detect any starlight in the continuum .",
    "line fluxes are measured by integrating our best fit obtained for a multi - gaussian model . for xid-312 ,",
    "there is significant galaxy continuum , and so we use gandalf @xcite with bc03 models @xcite to model and subtract the galaxy continuum before applying the same line - fitting routines . in case of xid-476 and xid-231 , a single gaussian is sufficient to model the line profiles , but for xid-312 with its broad component in h@xmath4 and line blending with [ n ii ] , a multi - component fit is necessary .",
    "we scale the spectra to the flux in the broad acs f606w filter .    in figure [",
    "fig : bpt ] , we plot the line ratios for [ o iii]/h@xmath42 versus [ n ii]/h@xmath4 .",
    "we find that the line ratios are not typical of seyfert 2 galaxies ; all fall below the demarcation line of kewley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that cleanly separates star - forming and agn dominated galaxies .",

    "( 2008 ) , are indicated by small blue circles ; these galaxies have been selected to be bona - fide agns by their emission - line ratios .",
    "two of our three galaxies are located at low [ nii]/h@xmath4 and high [ oiii]/h@xmath42 .",
    "given the low stellar masses of our sample , these low ratios are most naturally explained as a metallicity effect @xcite . from the [ nii]/h@xmath4 ratio , using the empirical calibration of nagao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we estimate the metallicities of the three host galaxies to be in the range of 0.3 - 0.6 solar metallicity . from the total emission - line intensity ratios i(h@xmath4)/i(h@xmath42 )",
    ", we estimate that all three galaxies show internal extinction ranging from a@xmath55=0.9 - 1.6 mag .    in the case of xid-312 , we report here a possible identification of a broad h@xmath4 line in the low - resolution optical spectrum from szokoly et al .",
    "we performed the decomposition of the h@xmath4 profile into a gaussian for the broad component and the [ o iii ] line profile to model the narrow h@xmath4 and [ n ii ] .",
    "we estimate that the broad component has a fwhm of @xmath56 km  s@xmath3 ( corrected for instrumental resolution ) but caution that the resolution of this spectrum is low , and the continuum is dominated by galaxy light . the corresponding black hole mass would be log @xmath57=5.3 using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "although x - ray variability of this source and the broad h@xmath4 line are strong indications of an agn , the overall line ratios place this galaxy in the composite ( sf + agn ) region in the bpt diagram @xcite ( see figure [ fig : bpt ] ) .",
    "we can use the narrow line emission as a further test of the origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "we take the total h@xmath4 luminosity as an upper limit to the sfr , under the conservative assumption that there is no contribution to the line emission from an agn .",
    "sfrs are corrected for galactic and internal extinction based on the measured balmer decrement assuming a @xcite extinction curve .",
    "using h@xmath4 luminosity , we find that the upper limits to the sfrs are @xmath580.2 - 0.6 @xmath59  yr@xmath3 , and are consistent with those seen in galaxies with masses of @xmath35 @xmath59 @xcite . as a second sfr estimator",
    ", we use the extinction corrected galex - nuv flux measurement , which gives a consistent sfr estimation again assuming no contribution from accretion . we find that for these upper limits on the sfrs , the x - ray emission is @xmath60 ( xid-231 , xid-476 ) and @xmath61 ( xid-312 ) larger than expected for star - forming galaxies ( see figure [ fig : xrayel_sfr ] ) using the relations given in @xcite and @xcite",
    ".    therefore , there are two possible explanations for our sources .",
    "first , they have one or several highly super - eddington x - ray binaries , or ultra - luminous x - ray sources .",
    "second , they contain accreting nuclear black holes . in either case , they are interesting outliers from the @xmath62 relations . in the case of xid-312 ,",
    "the x - ray variability and broad h@xmath4 line both suggest that the source is powered by a massive bh .",
    "we test the possibility of some super - eddington x - ray binaries through a simple monte - carlo test .",
    "we find that the probability for the two remaining galaxies to be outliers ( @xmath63 ) in the @xmath64-sfr relation is @xmath65 based on our parent population of @xmath66 galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we expect at most one false positive detection at @xmath67 within our parent . for this test",
    "we make the conservative assumption that we have a uniform x - ray sensitivity of the 4 ms survey for the full parent population .",
    "we examine the host morphologies of each agn candidate to provide some clues as to the formation mechanism of these low - mass black holes and their hosts .",

    "the bulge component of xid-312 appear to be consistent with the relation at higher mass as well as the bulge components of disks from @xcite with similar bh masses .",
    "the morphological analysis of xid-476 using galfit to fit a srsic model shows that its host galaxy is an early type galaxy based on the best - fit srsic index ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we do not find a point source ( host / nuclear@xmath6840 ) in the center of the galaxy .",
    "since we do not have a broad emission line to use to estimate the bh mass , we convert the stellar bulge mass into a bh mass using the relation from @xcite , yielding a bh mass of @xmath72 @xmath59 .    xid-231 has the lowest stellar mass of all three candidates ( log m@xmath73 ) and shows the most peculiar host among all three galaxies .",
    "we find no sign of a point source ( host / nuclear@xmath6840 ) from our two - dimensional imaging analysis .",
    "although the best - fit single srsic index is n=2.4 , the residuals are significant and suggest that a single srsic model is insufficient to describe the host morphology . adding further srsic models to the fit reduces the residuals but we can not identify a prominent bulge or disk component even by fixing some of the parameters .",
    "we conclude that this galaxy is of an irregular type .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of three low - mass black hole candidates residing in the centers of low - mass galaxies at @xmath0 in the @xmath1 deep field - south survey . </S>",

    "<S> multi - wavelength observations are used to strengthen our claim that such emission is powered by an accreting supermassive black hole . while the x - ray luminosities are low at @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( and variable in one case ) , we argue that they are unlikely to be attributed to star formation based on h@xmath4 or uv - fluxes . optical spectroscopy with keck / deimos and vlt / fors allows us to ( 1 ) measure accurate redshifts , ( 2 ) confirm their low stellar host mass , ( 3 ) investigate the source(s ) of photo - ionization , and ( 4 ) estimate extinction . with stellar masses of @xmath5 m@xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> determined from hst / acs imaging , the host galaxies are among the lowest mass systems known to host actively accreting black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate bh masses @xmath7 m@xmath6 based on scaling relations between bh mass and host properties for more luminous systems . in one case , a broad component of the h@xmath4 emission - line profile is detected thus providing a virial mass estimate . </S>",
    "<S> black holes in such low - mass galaxies are of considerable interest as the low - redshift analogs to the seeds of the most massive bhs at high redshift which have remained largely elusive to date . </S>",
    "<S> our study highlights the power of deep x - ray surveys to uncover such low - mass systems . </S>"
