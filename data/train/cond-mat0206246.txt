    "amphiphilic molecules in water self - assemble into a variety of structures , including micelles , bilayer vesicles , and stacks of bilayer membranes . when a dehydrated lump of amphiphile is brought into contact with water",
    ", it will develop a large number of tubular structures which grow to lengths many times larger than their radii  @xcite .",
    "these tubes , called _ myelin figures _ , are densely - packed , nested stacks of coaxial cylindrical bilayers  @xcite .",
    "typically the outer radius of such a stack is on the order of tens of microns and the inner radius can be as small as or smaller than @xmath0  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "myelin figures tend to be straight over lengths many times longer than their radii , but eventually bend or fold back on themselves  @xcite .",
    "though they appear to have no intrinsic chirality , they are observed to form coils or double helices  @xcite .",
    "coiling has also been observed in cylindrical stacks of binary mixtures  @xcite , and egg - yolk phosphatidylcholine  @xcite . in the first system",
    ", @xmath1 ions were added to myelin figures formed from a binary mixture of cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine . above a critical concentration of ions ,",
    "tightly - packed , single helices were formed .",
    "coiling was also observed when the system was hydrated with a solution of @xmath1 ions . in the latter system",
    ", the myelin figures would be straight initially but form helices and other structures after they had been growing for several minutes .",
    "it was presumed that the observed coiling in both systems was due to surface adhesion .",
    "however , coiling has also been observed recently in another system of myelin figures hydrated with a polymer solution in which it was demonstrated that surface adhesion played a negligiable role in the coiling mechanism  @xcite .",
    "coiling in this system was attributed to an interaction between the polymer and the membranes which resulted in a local spontaneous curvature . in  @xcite",
    ", a model was developed in which the polymer is allowed to diffuse freely along the bilayer surfaces . once the polymer concentration is above a critical concentration , the straight myelin figure becomes unstable to one which is maximally coiled .",
    "unilamellar tubes in the presence of the same polymer , on the other hand , are known to exhibit a _ pearling instability _  @xcite . here , the tubes are formed first and a drop of polymer solution is added later . in the early stages of the instability ,",
    "the tubes develop a periodic oscillation along their length which leads , eventually , to the formation of a string of spheres .",
    "a different pearling instability has also been observed in unilamellar tubes excited with optical tweezers  @xcite and has been attributed to induced surface tension  @xcite , and unilamellar tubes with oil incorporated into the bilayer  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the bending and interaction energies for undulations of a cylindrical multilamellar stack .",
    "we then study the instabilities generated by perturbing the stack in various ways : ( 1 ) we add spontaneous curvature to all the bilayers , and ( 2 ) we decrease the interaction equilibrium distance between the layers after the stacks have been formed .",
    "we show that the most unstable mode ( neglecting dynamics ) breaks the chiral symmetry of the cylinders and introduces a twisting undulation , which may be related to coiling .",
    "in contrast , spontaneous curvature on a unilamellar cylindrical vesicle results in periodic oscillation along the cylinder axis , as in the pearling instability .",
    "a similar instability in a smectic - a liquid crystal confined within a cylindrical channel with homeotropic boundary conditions was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions cause the smectic layers to arrange themselves into co - axial cylinders much like myelin figures .",
    "the presence of the confining walls changes the nature of the instability , however , since the outer layer of a myelin figure is not fixed to be a cylinder .",
    "also , those authors consider only undulations which vary along the length of the cylinder which explicitely prohibits instabilities that break chiral symmetry .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we calculate the total energy of a cylindrical multilamellar stack to second order in arbitrary undulations of the radius . in section",
    "iii we demonstrate the existence of the instabilities . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the nature of the instabilities .",
    "finally , we summarize in section v.",
    "we will assume the bilayers in the cylindrical stack to be equally spaced , though the actual distribution of layers is unknown . at length scales larger than molecular lengths , it is appropriate to model a bilayer membrane as a two dimensional surface",
    ". there are two equivalent representations of the membrane surfaces that we will use .    on one hand , we can introduce local coordinates on the cylinders @xmath2 and a vector function @xmath3 which gives the position in space of any point on the membrane .",
    "the @xmath4 membrane in the stack can then be described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is independent of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for a cylinder of radius @xmath9 .",
    "we generalize this to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spacing between the layers , and @xmath12 is an undulation of the cylinder radius . since the membranes in the stack are very close together , the undulations of the layers are severely constrained and @xmath12 should be slowly varying radially . therefore , to simplify our calculations , we specialize to the case where @xmath12 is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "the induced metric , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the differential surface area element is @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the mean curvature and gaussian curvature are defined to be the trace and determinant respectively of the curvature tensor , @xmath21 , given by , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the covariant derivative .",
    "then @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the laplace - beltrami operator acting on a scalar . in two dimensions ,",
    "@xmath26 is a topological invariant .",
    "an alternative way to represent the layers is with a function @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath4 membrane is then given by the solution to the equation @xmath28 for some @xmath29 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath30 describes a cylinder with a radius given by @xmath31 . in this representation ,",
    "we write the unit normal as @xmath32 .",
    "this gives the unit normal as a function of @xmath33 so we use @xmath34 for the unit normal on the @xmath4 membrane .",
    "finally , we write @xmath35 and @xmath36 gives the mean curvature on the @xmath4 membrane .",
    "this representation is similar to that used for smectic liquid crystals ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the theory of the bending energy of amphiphilic membranes is well - established for small curvatures  @xcite .",
    "the bending energy is given by , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean curvature , @xmath39 is the gaussian curvature , and @xmath40 is the spontaneous curvature .",
    "spontaneous curvature can arise from an asymmetry between the two monolayers of the membrane . here",
    "we will assume that @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath42 is a topological invariant and we do not allow topology change , we suppress this term .",
    "we assume that the surface area per molecule is constant .",
    "though myelin figures are nonequilibrium structures , we will also assume that their rate of growth , @xmath43  @xcite , is slow enough to allow us to treat them as being in equilibrium at any given time .",
    "these assumptions together give us the constraint that the total surface area of the layers should remain constant .",
    "to impliment this constraint , we add an effective surface tension of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the surface area of the membrane and the surface tension , @xmath46 , is actually a lagrange multiplier chosen to enforce the constraint .    this single constraint , however , is not enough to ensure that a cylindrical membrane is an extremum of the bending energy .",
    "if we neglect the endcap energy ( which is reasonable for long cylinders ) , the mean curvature for a cylinder of radius @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the bending energy of a cylinder can always be lowered by increasing the radius , and we can always do so while conserving area by decreasing the length . an additional contribution to the free energy",
    "is necessary for a cylindrical membrane to be stable .",
    "since the mechanism which stabilizes a myelin figure is still poorly understood , there are a number of possible approaches we can take to this problem . on the one hand , sakurai and kawamura  @xcite",
    "suggest that a cylindrical stack can be stabilized by the interaction energy , which forbids the layers from increasing their separation .",
    "this still allows for the possibility of increasing all the radii without changing their separations .",
    "a second possibility is that of osmotic pressure which keeps the volume between the layers constant . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors use osmotic pressure to stabilize a cylindrical vesicle and their results have a simple generalization to cylindrical stacks .",
    "however , for mathematical simplicity , we choose to solve this by adding a linear tension ( of the form @xmath49 ) . by choosing the linear tension and surface tension properly",
    ", we can ensure that a cylindrical stack of any length and distribution of layers is an extremum of the energy . in section",
    "v , we comment on how conserving the volume between the layers changes our results .    finally , the effective energy of each membrane layer , without interactions between the layers and with @xmath41 , is given by , @xmath50    it will be convenient to use the fourier series representation for the function @xmath51 .",
    "since the cylinder length is much longer than the radius , we will neglect the contribution of the ends of the stack to the energy and will impose periodic boundary conditions along the cylinder axis .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the cylinder length , and both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are integers .",
    "the reality of @xmath51 imposes the condition @xmath57 on the fourier coefficients where @xmath58 signifies the complex conjugate .",
    "the coefficient @xmath59 represents changes of radius of all the bilayers .",
    "this coefficient is redundant with the layer separation @xmath11 and the core radius .",
    "we calculate @xmath46 and @xmath60 for each layer by imposing the conditions that the first derivative of the bending energy of a straight cylinder with respect to both radius and length should vanish .",
    "this gives us @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath47 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "expanding the bending energy to second order in @xmath51 and its derivatives and using these values for @xmath46 and @xmath60 results in the expression , @xmath63 for the bending energy of each bilayer , where @xmath64 is the @xmath4 membrane radius .",
    "notice that the first order variation of the bending energy with respect to the undulations @xmath51 vanishes since there are no terms in the bending energy linear in @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that a straight cylinder is an extremum of this bending energy .",
    "also , notice that the undulation mode with @xmath66 and @xmath67 has zero bending energy .",
    "since the shape change associated with this mode causes a change in the mean curvature of higher than second order , it is typically associated with translation of the cylinder normal to the long axis .    finally , to find the total bending energy we sum over the membranes .",
    "since they are very dense , we go over to the continuum limit and replace @xmath68 with @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the radius of the stack , and @xmath71 is the radius of the core . the final result for",
    "the bending energy is , @xmath72 where we have used the fact that @xmath73 .",
    "the largest contribution to the interaction energy comes from nearest - neighbor membranes .",
    "consider the shortest curve between the two membranes which is normal to both surfaces .",
    "if the membrane separation and size of undulations are small , this curve is nearly straight and , for any point @xmath2 on one membrane with normal curve passing through it , the interaction energy gets its dominant contribution from the point on the other membrane which lies along the curve .",
    "let @xmath74 be the length of the normal curve between the two membranes , @xmath11 be the separation of the layers with no undulations , and @xmath29 be the equilibrium separation of the layers . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that @xmath11 and @xmath29 are constant ( in particular , they are independent of @xmath13 ) .",
    "to find @xmath75 , we represent the membrane surfaces as solutions to the equation @xmath76 .",
    "then , noting that @xmath77 in the absence of defects and that @xmath78 , we can write @xmath79 $ ]    we can then expand the interaction energy in powers of @xmath80 to second order .",
    "the first order term vanishes since @xmath29 is the equilibrium separation , so the interaction energy density is @xmath81 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath82 is the bulk modulus .",
    "this must be integrated over the surface of each membrane in the layer .",
    "this interaction energy is similar to the familiar de gennes elastic term for the free energy of a smectic liquid crystal  @xcite .",
    "however , our bulk modulus @xmath82 has units of energy per area rather than energy per volume as it does in a liquid crystal .    to properly choose @xmath46 and @xmath60",
    ", we should take into account the interaction energy of the membranes .",
    "doing so gives a correction to our value for @xmath46 at nonzero @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , this gives @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the radius of the @xmath4 membrane .",
    "using our value for @xmath86 , the resulting interaction energy per layer is , @xmath87 \\big\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if there are no undulations , the interaction energy is zero even for nonzero @xmath88 .",
    "this comes about because of the correction to @xmath46 . without this correction",
    ", a cylindrical stack with @xmath89 will not be an extremum of the energy .",
    "we finally note that if @xmath90 , there is no contribution from the interaction energy to second order .",
    "this is because we are not allowing the undulation of the radius , @xmath51 , to vary from bilayer to bilayer so , to second order , they remain equidistant .",
    "adding the terms , @xmath91 to the bending energy of each layer gives each membrane a spontaneous curvature , @xmath40 . in order to conserve surface area the surface tension , @xmath46 , will adjust itself to cancel the second term exactly . without changing the linear tension ,",
    "however , there will appear terms in the total energy that are linear in the @xmath65 arising from the first term of equation ( [ eq : spontcurv ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to an instability that _ decreases _ the radii of the lamellae .",
    "however , the interaction energy of the stack requires that the change in radius of the layers be independent of the radii of the layers .",
    "conservation of surface area implies that the change in length , @xmath92 , be related to the change in radius , @xmath93 , by the expression @xmath94 .    since @xmath95",
    ", we see that the length of each layer is increased . however , the change of length is smaller for the layers with larger radii .",
    "the endcap of the inner layers will , therefore , be able to reach the endcaps of the outerlayers very early in this instability .",
    "this will prevent any large changes of length in the cylindrical stack .",
    "fixing the length of the cylindrical stack can be accomplished by adjusting the linear tension to be @xmath96 . with these changes , terms that are first order in the @xmath65",
    "expanding the resulting energy to second order in the undulations results in the following additional term to equation ( [ eq : layerbend ] ) , @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 . approximating the sum over membranes with an integral ,",
    "the total stack energy is calculated to be @xmath100 , where , @xmath101    since @xmath54 is large , @xmath102 is well - approximated as a continuous variable , @xmath103 . for @xmath104 , we have , @xmath105    minimizing this to find the most unstable mode gives @xmath106 with an onset threshold of @xmath107 . for @xmath67 ,",
    "we have , @xmath108    this expression is negative whenever @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this threshold is much smaller than the threshold for the @xmath104 instability .",
    "finally , larger values of @xmath55 can be analyzed like the @xmath104 case , yielding even larger thresholds for instability .",
    "notice that @xmath111 is proportional to @xmath112 , so the critical wavelength is very long for spontaneous curvatures just above @xmath113 .",
    "the most unstable wavelength can be found by minimizing @xmath114 .",
    "doing so gives the most unstable mode to be @xmath115 .",
    "we can do a similar analysis on a unilamellar membrane by using the energy for a single layer .",
    "the procedure above establishes the existence of an instability when @xmath116 where @xmath47 is the cylinder radius for both @xmath104 and @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath67 instability starts with long wavelength modes , however , while the @xmath104 instability has an onset wavelength of @xmath117 and is expected to dominate .",
    "this result qualitatively agrees with ou - yang and helfrich s calculation of instabilities in cylindrical vesicles  @xcite stabilized by osmotic pressure .",
    "one crucial difference , however , is that the @xmath67 mode never goes unstable in their calculation .",
    "the discrepancy must be in our choice of linear tension over osmotic pressure to stabilize the cylindrical vesicle .",
    "we now consider the situation when the equilibrium distance between the membranes is decreased .",
    "this requires special care because the mode which relaxes the equilibrium distance by reducing the radii uniformly and increasing the length has been neglected by assuming @xmath51 is independent of radius .",
    "this relaxation mode carries a linear dependence on the radius , @xmath47 , and will need to be considered explicitely .",
    "there are two effects which compete against the complete relaxation of the interaction energy through this mode .",
    "the first is the curvature energy which resists decreasing the radii of any of the membrane layers .",
    "the second is the endcap energy which resists changes of length .",
    "the stack will be unable to completely relax its interaction energy because of these effects , and the resulting separation between the layers , @xmath11 , will be larger than the new equilibrium distance , @xmath29 .",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to a swelled stack , which for a flat , lamellar phase results in a helfrich - hurault type instability  @xcite .    for a cylindrical stack ,",
    "this results in an additional contribution to equation ( [ eq : layerbend ] ) of , @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "summing over all membranes in the stack gives a total energy @xmath120 , where , @xmath121    we again study the stability of the energy for different choices of @xmath55 while taking @xmath102 to be continuous . for @xmath104",
    ", we have , @xmath122    this equation gives a most unstable mode of @xmath123 and an instability whenever @xmath124 .",
    "for @xmath67 , we have , @xmath125 which is negative when @xmath126 ^ 2}{r^4}}$ ] .",
    "thus , the reality of @xmath103 requires that @xmath127 , or @xmath128 .",
    "again , this threshold is smaller than the @xmath104 threshold and the thresholds for instability for @xmath129 are even higher than the @xmath104 case .",
    "we see then that , as @xmath130 is increased , the first mode to destabilize is the one with @xmath67 and @xmath131 for small @xmath88 .",
    "we find the most unstable wavenumber to be @xmath132",
    ".    the critical wavelength , @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the smectic penetration length , can be quite short .",
    "a 0.1 percent reduction in equilibrium distance results in a critical wavelength of approximately @xmath135 . if @xmath136 is on the order of the layer spacing and there are several hundred layers in the cylindrical stack , the critical wavelength will be on the order of a tube radius . a one percent reduction in equilibrium distance results in a critical wavelength smaller than a single tube radius .",
    "whenever @xmath137 , there are two types of behavior that can result , which we refer to as twisting ( or coiling ) and writhing .",
    "twisting can be represented by a model undulation of the form @xmath138 , for example , which breaks the chiral symmetry of the cylinders .",
    "writhing , on the other hand , can be represented by @xmath139 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "fourier coefficients which give twisting for @xmath67 and some choice of @xmath103 are @xmath140 and @xmath141 with the remaining coefficients zero or set by the reality condition on @xmath51 . in the case of writhing",
    ", we have @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the normalization factors of @xmath144 and @xmath145 are necessary so that the amplitudes of both undulations are equal to @xmath146 .",
    "now we can write the energy for both instabilities in the form , @xmath147    so we see that whenever @xmath148 , the most unstable case is twisting and not writhing . since the @xmath67 mode moves the center axis of the cylinders in the stack , we speculate that this mode may result in coiling as seen in experiments .    in both types of instabilities discussed , the first mode to go unstable is the mode with @xmath67 and @xmath149 .",
    "we expect that , when dynamics is taken into account , this @xmath149 mode will grow more slowly than all other wavelengths .",
    "thus , the dominant wavelength will be at some @xmath150 .",
    "it is not clear , however , how dynamics will affect whether the stack twists or writhes , and whether the behavior will lead to coiling .",
    "in this paper , we considered a nested stack of cylindrical , interacting membranes .",
    "we studied the instabilities generated by perturbing the stack in two ways : ( 1 ) we add spontaneous curvature to all the bilayers , and ( 2 ) we decrease the interaction equilibrium distance between the layers after the stacks have been formed . in both cases , we find that the first modes to go unstable are long wavelength modes which break the rotational symmetry of the cylinder .",
    "we find that the most unstable modes break chiral symmetry and may be related to the coiling which is observed in myelin figures .",
    "we should stress that we have studied only two in a larger class of instabilities . if we imagine perturbing the system by adding a term to the free energy that prefers local undulations of the layers , we are constrained , by dimensional analysis , to write down , @xmath151 to quadratic order in @xmath65 , @xmath55 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the units of @xmath152 and @xmath130 ( assumed the same ) determine the value of @xmath153 . as we have shown , a chiral symmetry breaking instability will occur when @xmath154 or @xmath155 .",
    "different mechanisms might then give rise to similar instabilities , depending only on the dimensions of their coefficients and the general condition that they result in local undulations .",
    "we expect , therefore , that there may be many instabilities of nested cylindrical stacks that lead to similar behavior .",
    "the instability resulting from decreasing the layer equilibrium distance bears some resemblence to an instability due to deswelling a myelin figure discovered by chen , _ _",
    "e__t al .",
    "they consider myelin figures whose outer layers only have been deswelled . in this case",
    ", the in - plane elasticity of the layers becomes relevant .",
    "they find that deswelling a myelin figure in this way results in an axisymmetric instability ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "it is important to note that allowing @xmath88 or @xmath40 to vary with radius can change the results completely .",
    "we see this already if we consider adding spontaneous curvature only to the outermost layers of the stack . in that case",
    ", the additional energy will be approximately proportional to the energy of a cylindrical vesicle .",
    "as we have already seen , an energy of this form has a short wavelength axisymmetric instability ( @xmath104 ) and a long wavelength helical instability ( @xmath67 ) , both at the same threshold .",
    "we have already mentioned that our results for a spontaneous curvature - induced instability in a cylindrical vesicle disagree with those of  @xcite , which uses osmotic pressure rather than linear tension to stabilize the vesicles .",
    "this sensitivity to our choice of constraints carries over to a cylindrical stack , also .",
    "a cylindrical stack with fixed volume between the layers which acquires spontaneous curvature on all of its layers will not develop an instability at @xmath67 as in the case of a cylindrical vesicle . the first mode to destabilize",
    "must then be @xmath104 .",
    "we have checked , however , that using osmotic pressure on a cylindrical stack whose equilibrium distance has been decreased still results in an instability with @xmath67 and onset @xmath157 , but does change the value of @xmath158 .",
