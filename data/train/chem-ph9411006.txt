    "spin - boson systems provide archetypical models for many low - temperature dissipative quantum tunneling systems @xcite .",
    "applications include diverse problems such as the observability of macroscopic quantum coherence in a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) @xcite , interstitial tunneling of light particles such as hydrogen in metals @xcite , and many others discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "two other examples are of special importance to this work .",
    "first , the so - called kondo problem concerns localized spin impurities in nonmagnetic metals @xcite .",
    "the second comes from the realm of chemical physics  in certain parameter regions , the spin - boson model provides a generalization of the marcus model for electron transfer reactions @xcite .",
    "the wide range of applicability of the spin - boson model stems from its apparent generality  by coupling two exactly solvable models bilinearly , namely a two - state system ( spin ) and an infinite - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( boson ) bath , one obtains a nontrivial description for many dissipative systems@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the spin - boson system has been widely studied using the feynman - vernon influence functional method@xcite , mostly in conjunction with instanton techniques @xcite .",
    "much of the physics of this model has been unraveled by analytical methods , though an exact solution is not possible ( except for some special parameter values ) .",
    "one particularly useful analytical approximation is the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) @xcite .",
    "although the niba has been rather successful , there are important regions in parameter space where this approximation is expected to fail .",
    "very recently , numerical techniques for computing the dynamics of dissipative two - state systems have been developed@xcite .",
    "these real - time quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations have confirmed the niba predictions quantitatively in many cases , and in addition have provided information in regions where the niba breaks down .",
    "however , due to the fundamental _ dynamical sign problem _ inherent in these calculations @xcite , the numerical computations are restricted in their accessible range of real times .",
    "the dynamical sign problem arises because at long times a large number of interfering paths contribute , leading to a very small signal - to - noise ratio . in effect",
    ", the simulation becomes unstable .",
    "consequently , even numerically exact qmc methods have not been able to resolve many important questions concerning the behavior of the spin - boson system , especially at low temperatures and long times .",
    "it is important to point out that many other approaches to dealing with the dynamical sign problem have been developed during the last decade .",
    "for example , methods based on related filtering techniques @xcite , optimized reference systems @xcite , or analytic continuation procedures following a conventional imaginary - time qmc simulation @xcite have been proposed .",
    "similar to the one described in this work , the first two methods attempt a direct simulation in real time .",
    "while we restrict our attention to _ discrete _ ( tight - binding ) systems which is adequate for many problems in low - temperature physics , these previous methods are designed for extended systems . on the other hand",
    ", the third method makes use of an imaginary - time simulation that has no dynamical sign problem to obtain numerical data which are then analytically continued to real times . to date",
    "this procedure has only be used to find ( e.g. , electronic ) spectral densities . while real - time information follows from the knowledge of these densities , such calculations have yet to be performed and hence the effectiveness of this approach to real - time dynamics is untested .",
    "we also point out that a similar numerical problem exists for qmc simulations of fermionic many - body systems@xcite . this _",
    "fermion sign problem _ has a different origin from the one dealt with here .",
    "it is due to the antisymmetry of fermionic wavefunctions , and makes even imaginary - time simulations problematic .",
    "if simulated in imaginary time , however , the spin - boson model does not pose any sign problem .    in this paper we propose a new simulation method to study the spin - boson dynamics numerically .",
    "like our earlier approaches , this technique is based on a discretized path integral representation of the dynamical quantities of interest , but differs from them in that it exploits the symmetry properties of the influence functional .",
    "this allows for an exact treatment of the numerically problematic quasiclassical paths , and one is left with a stochastic monte carlo sampling of the quantum fluctuations alone .",
    "related methods have been used previously to study quantum brownian motion @xcite , and we have used a similar algorithm to study the primary electron transfer steps in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center@xcite . furthermore , this idea of exploiting the symmetries of the influence functional has also led to an efficient simulation method for computing the mobility and diffusion coefficient of a dissipative particle in an infinite tight - binding lattice @xcite . the algorithm for this diffusion problem ,",
    "however , is rather different from the one employed in the case of a system with a small number of tight - binding states . in this article",
    ", we provide a detailed description of our simulation method for the dissipative two - state system ; the necessary generalizations for the case of more than two states should be obvious .",
    "we apply this special method to the spin - boson model in the low - temperature and the small bath cutoff regions .",
    "the accuracy of the niba in some other parameter regions has been confirmed by our earlier simulations already , and the numerical results presented in this work focus on these previously inaccessible regions . since the present algorithm is more powerful than previous methods , we are able to study longer times and much lower temperatures .",
    "data are presented for two practical problems of current interest : ( 1 ) electron transfer in a condensed phase environment , where we have examined the transition from nonadiabatic to adiabatic behavior for both the high - temperature and the low - temperature case .",
    "the high - temperature results should coincide with classical marcus theory , whereas for low temperatures we would expect quantum effects commonly attributed to nuclear tunneling @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the dissipative two - state system is also significant for the antiferromagnetic kondo problem of a localized impurity embedded in a nonmagnetic metal @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic kondo hamiltonian is related to the spin - boson model in a certain parameter region , and we have studied the most interesting antiferromagnetic case @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is kondo s parameter , at zero temperature . an important question to be addressed in this parameter region relates to the destruction of quantum coherence . for @xmath2 , one can observe quantum coherence ( oscillatory behavior ) in the zero - temperature dynamics of the dissipative system .",
    "the niba predicts such coherent behavior to be completely destroyed for @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , the justification for niba is suspect in this special parameter region , and our method offers an unique way of studying this region .    in section",
    "ii we present our simulation method for the dissipative two - state system .",
    "the results for the crossover between nonadiabatic and adiabatic electron transfer are discussed in section iii , followed by a discussion of the dynamics in the antiferromagnetic kondo region at very low temperatures . some final remarks and conclusions",
    "are given in section iv .",
    "in the following we present a dynamical simulation technique for dissipative tight - binding models with a finite number of states . for simplicity ,",

    "the bath is described by harmonic oscillators @xmath11 which are bilinearly coupled to the spin operator @xmath10 .",
    "this type of coupling is reasonable for the problems considered in this work ( and for many others ) ; for a justification , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .    within this model ,",
    "the bath parameters enter only via a single function called the spectral density @xmath12 which should have a continuous form in the limit of infinitely many bath oscillators .",
    "the spectral density then determines the bath correlation function @xcite @xmath13}{\\sinh[\\omega\\hbar\\beta/2]}\\;,\\ ] ] which is defined for complex - valued times @xmath14 .",
    "the distance between the localized states is given by a lengthscale @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",

    "the timescale distribution of bath motions is described by a cutoff frequency @xmath20 . for many problems in low - temperature physics , this cutoff frequency",
    "is taken to be the largest frequency scale in the problem . in the case of electron transfer ,",
    "the same spectral density with some intermediate value for @xmath20 is most appropriate for a realistic description of many polar solvents@xcite .",

    "there are several other possible choices of this contour due to the cyclic structure of the trace .    to parametrize the paths , we use @xmath36 uniformly spaced discrete points for each of the two real - time paths and @xmath37 points for the imaginary - time path ( see fig.[fig0 ] ) . hence , there are @xmath38 points in total .",

    "marcus found a bath activation energy @xmath149 , and combining this with a conventional estimate for the landau - zener factor@xcite , one obtains a formula for the total ( forward plus backward ) rate @xcite @xmath150 which is valid for @xmath151 .",
    "the landau - zener factor contains a frequency scale @xmath152 reminiscent of transition state theory which is usually applied to the adiabatic limit@xcite .",
    "note that for small electronic couplings , the rate @xmath153 which is just the golden rule behavior . in the adiabatic limit of large @xmath6 , however , the rate becomes independent of @xmath6 , and the dynamics is totally solvent - controlled .",
    "we note that for the spectral density ( [ ohmic ] ) , one can obtain analytical expressions in the nonadiabatic golden rule limit for both the high- and low - temperature rate ( @xmath154 provides a rough measure for the temperature below which quantum effects due to nuclear tunneling become important ) . for the special values @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the crossover behavior from high to low temperatures can be solved explicitly @xcite .    in fig.[fig1 ] we show some results for @xmath27 in the high - temperature limit ; in this parameter region , the effects of the initial preparation are negligible , so @xmath157 . for a study of the crossover between nonadiabatic and adiabatic behaviors ,",
    "all model parameters except @xmath6 are kept fixed . in the case of small @xmath6",
    ", the simulation results exhibit a monoexponential decay on the golden rule timescale .",
    "however , for larger @xmath6 , the dynamics becomes progressively more complex . after a fast initial transient",
    ", the decay slows down ; fitting this slower decay to an exponential law , one can again extract a rate for this adiabatic situation .",
    "the @xmath6-dependent high - temperature rates measured in units of @xmath20 are plotted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "clearly , the nonadiabatic limit is nicely reproduced by the simulations for small @xmath6 , and the rates @xmath153 . in the adiabatic limit ,",
    "the rate constant is approximately _ independent _ of the magnitude of the electronic coupling .",
    "these results are in agreement with the conventional landau - zener prediction ( [ clas ] ) in the limit of high temperatures .",
    "remarkably , the data in fig.[fig2 ] show that the golden rule formula is accurate for values of @xmath158 as large as @xmath159 .",
    "note also that we find a monotonic dependence of the rate on @xmath6 , in contrast to the findings of skourtis et al.@xcite which are based on a rather simplistic hamiltonian and would predict a maximum in the rate as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "next we study the low - temperature region ( @xmath160 ) , where the classical rate formula ( [ clas ] ) is not expected to hold .",
    "again , we find complete agreement with the nonadiabatic golden rule formalism for small values of @xmath158 , with @xmath27 decaying monoexponentially on the golden rule timescale ( with a fast initial transient ) .",
    "when increasing @xmath158 beyond @xmath161 , however , the dynamics exhibits an oscillatory behavior as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this prevents a meaningful estimate for the decay constant ( but when increasing @xmath1 to significantly larger values , we expect that the dynamics will become totally incoherent again , at least for not too small @xmath162 ) .",
    "we note that in the limit @xmath163 ( but @xmath164 finite ) , the dynamics can be solved exactly .",
    "this is the case of a strictly adiabatic bath @xcite , where the dynamics is always oscillatory . from the simulations we also observe that the nonadiabatic regime is confined to increasingly smaller values for @xmath158 when the temperature is lowered .    in conclusion ,",
    "the simulations confirm the classical picture for the crossover from nonadiabatic to adiabatic electron transfer in the high - temperature limit and , in addition , provide a dynamical explanation . in the low - temperature limit , however , the dynamics becomes oscillatory unless the system - bath coupling is made very large .",
    "we next turn to a different problem .",
    "the determination of the dynamical quantities of interest in the low - temperature kondo region characterized by a kondo parameter @xmath0 has been a long - standing problem .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of the relationship of the spin - boson model to the kondo problem@xcite .",
    "the kondo hamiltonian in its simplest form describes a spin-@xmath165 impurity interacting with a band of free electrons via isotropic exchange scattering .",
    "a particularly useful method for studying the low - temperature spin relaxation dynamics of the kondo problem ( the equilibrium properties are well understood@xcite ) employs a bosonization procedure to map it onto a spin - boson problem with ohmic dissipation@xcite .",
    "the case @xmath0 then corresponds to the interesting antiferromagnetic kondo problem .",
    "the important dynamical quantity in the kondo problem is the imaginary part of the frequency - dependent spin susceptibility , @xmath166 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the fourier transform of the correlation function ( [ ctt ] ) @xmath167 therefore a computation of @xmath30 will yield all relevant dynamical quantities ( structure factor , dynamical susceptibility , etc . ) of the kondo problem .",
    "unfortunately , the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) by leggett et al.@xcite can not be justified in this region for temperatures below the kondo temperature defined as @xmath168 , where @xmath169 .",
    "in fact , if one equates @xmath157 ( which niba predicts is true ) , the niba would imply certain unphysical properties of the related kondo problem , such as a divergence in the susceptibility as @xmath170 .",
    "furthermore , this parameter region is also interesting in the context of macroscopic quantum coherence , since there could be remnants of coherent ( oscillatory ) behavior in the zero - temperature dynamics for @xmath171 . for this region",
    ", niba predicts a complete destruction of quantum coherence .",
    "we have studied @xmath27 at zero temperature in order to check this prediction .",
    "some numerical results for this parameter region have already been given in refs.@xcite , and a biexponential behavior has been found .",
    "however , due to the limitations of our earlier techniques , these simulations were restricted to very small values for the cutoff ( @xmath172 has been used in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , our previous algorithm did not allow for a study of extremely low temperatures , and we have considered temperatures only slightly below @xmath173 .",
    "these shortcomings can be overcome by the algorithm discussed in sec .",
    "ii , and we are now able to reach both the scaling region @xmath174 and the zero - temperature limit for @xmath27 . at zero temperature , the timescale of the dynamics should be set solely by the frequency @xcite @xmath175^{1/2(1-k)}\\ , \\delta_r\\ ] ] where @xmath176 denotes the gamma function .",
    "this effective frequency scale is equal to @xmath6 at @xmath177 , becomes equal to @xmath178 for @xmath155 , and shrinks to zero as @xmath179 .",
    "since the cutoff @xmath20 should enter the dynamics only via a renormalization of this effective frequency scale , we use the dimensionless time @xmath180 ; at zero temperature , the only system parameter left is the kondo parameter . as shown by grabert and weiss @xcite , the niba solution for @xmath181 and @xmath182",
    "can be written in terms of the mittag - leffler function@xcite , @xmath183 in the parameter region @xmath184 , this describes a purely incoherent relaxation .    before discussing the zero - temperature limit for @xmath185 and @xmath0 , we first present data for the correlation function @xmath30 at @xmath155",
    "this special case has been solved exactly by sassetti and weiss @xcite , and one finds for sufficiently low temperatures that @xmath30 approaches zero _ from below _ at long times .",
    "this is reproduced by our simulations shown in fig.[fig4 ] ; the cutoff chosen here ( @xmath186 ) is already large enough to ensure the validity of @xmath174 .",
    "note that the corresponding exact solution for a factorizing initial state , @xmath187 , does not exhibit this behavior .",
    "finally , in fig.[fig5 ] we show qmc results for the exact @xmath181 dynamics of @xmath185 in the kondo region @xmath0 .",
    "the cutoff chosen here is within the scaling region @xmath174 so that the dynamics should depend only on the effective timescale @xmath180 . indeed ,",
    "as long as @xmath188 , we found that a change in the cutoff enters the dynamics solely via eq.([deff ] ) . since the frequency @xmath189 becomes extremely small with increasing @xmath1 , it is not possible to numerically study the @xmath181 dynamics on timescales of the order @xmath190 for @xmath1 larger than @xmath191 . here ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to @xmath192 and @xmath193 , see fig.[fig5 ] . for @xmath194 ,",
    "the qmc data for @xmath27 coincide with the exact solution .",
    "it is not possible to fit the numerical data in fig.[fig5 ] to simple ( exponential , biexponential , algebraic , etc . ) decay laws .",
    "however , it is obvious that _ the niba gives the correct qualitative picture _ , especially at short times .",
    "the exact dynamics is fully _ incoherent _ , yet of quite complicated appearance .",
    "these results again underline our earlier finding @xcite that _ the niba provides an excellent estimate for @xmath27 in the bulk of parameter space_. the data shown in fig.[fig5 ] suggest that the niba is more accurate for @xmath192 ; this indicates that the niba becomes exact for @xmath27 as @xmath195 .",
    "one may question how much the respective correlation functions @xmath30 will deviate from the @xmath27 depicted in fig.[fig5 ] , since @xmath30 is the relevant quantity for a comparison with the kondo problem . while the niba was shown to give an excellent approximation for the function @xmath27 even in the low - temperature kondo region , the quality of the niba - prediction @xmath157 seems to be poor in this region ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "we have carried out simulations for @xmath30 at temperatures slightly below @xmath196 for @xmath197 as well , and the characteristic behavior shown in fig.[fig4 ] , namely @xmath30 approaching zero from below as @xmath198 , was found to persist .",
    "this would resolve the divergence of the static spin susceptibility@xcite predicted by niba based on @xmath27 because @xmath27 and @xmath30 show qualitatively different behaviors .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath30 is also in correspondence with the exact shiba relation@xcite .    unfortunately , we were not able to reach the true zero - temperature limit for the equilibrium correlation function @xmath30",
    ". clearly , using the same kadanoff - baym contour employed in our method would require an infinitely long imaginary - time path for @xmath181 , which makes the algorithm impracticable . by invoking ergodicity arguments @xcite ,",
    "however , a viable variant of our algorithm may facilitate such a calculation . to that purpose",
    ", one might consider a factorized initial state at @xmath199 , so that for @xmath200 the system will be equilibrated at @xmath29 . in effect , one is then left with a real - time contour instead of the kadanoff - baym contour , and the initial correlations are represented by negative - time paths .",
    "this method is currently under study .",
    "we have proposed a real - time quantum monte carlo simulation method for a numerically exact computation of the dynamical quantities of the spin - boson model .",
    "our technique is based on a discretized path integral formulation and makes use of the symmetry properties of the dissipative influence functional , whereby one can integrate out the quasiclassical paths and is left with a stochastic sampling of the quantum fluctuations alone .",
    "this leads to a significant improvement compared to earlier methods , and allows us to study the dynamics at considerably longer times .",
    "the method is generally applicable to dissipative tight - binding systems with arbitrary spectral density .",
    "results have been presented for two problems of current interest .",
    "( a ) we have computed the electron transfer rate constant as a function of the electronic coupling in both the high - temperature and the low - temperature limit . in the high - temperature limit , the classical marcus result is reproduced ; for low temperatures , however , one obtains an oscillatory behavior for large electronic couplings which does not allow for a simple rate description .",
    "( b ) the dynamics in the antiferromagnetic kondo region has been computed at @xmath201 for several values of the kondo parameter . in accordance with the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) , we find a fully incoherent ( yet non - exponential ) decay for the occupation probability @xmath27 .",
    "initial preparation effects , however , lead to important deviations from the niba - prediction @xmath157 for the equilibrium correlation function .",
    "it is exactly this niba - equality which led to unphysical results for the equivalent kondo problem .",
