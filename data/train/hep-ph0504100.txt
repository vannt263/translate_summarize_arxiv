    "t hooft suggested that the inverse of number of colours ( @xmath1 ) could be used as an expansion coefficient in the otherwise parameter free qcd @xcite .",
    "based on this , witten @xcite suggested mean field ( mf ) description for baryons - prompting the use of phenomenological interquark potential tested in meson sector .",
    "indeed baryon mass ( @xmath2 ) was calculated at mf level @xcite using richardson potential as an interquark one @xcite .",
    "the potential has confinement and asymptotic freedom ( af ) built in - with a single scale parameter ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "although the lattice qcd gives a confinement scale ( @xmath4 ) - the af scale as given by perturbative qcd is   @xmath5 .",
    "for computing the hadron properties a @xmath6 is required whereas for high density strange quark matter ( sqm in short ) @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising as for the sqm the confinement gets screened and a much reduced @xmath8 appropritate for af part is required .",
    "hence it is important to separate out the two scales and re - do the hadron properties -like magnetic moments and masses for the baryons .",
    "in fact , bagchi et al @xcite calculated the masses ( @xmath2 ) and magnetic moments @xmath0 of @xmath9 and @xmath10 with a modified two parameter richardson potential using relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) method .",
    "the known @xmath0-s can not be explained by any model exactly and in addition there are some sumrules which are interesting to look at .",
    "the first one that is much referred is the franklin sumrule , named erroneously after coleman and glashow @xcite .",
    "the latter authors derived mass sumrules for su(3 ) breaking and found specific @xmath0-s but not the actual sumrule for the octet @xmath0-s - which was first done by franklin @xcite and so should carry his name .    presently , extending the calculation of bagchi et al @xcite with the modified potential we find all baryonic ( decuplet and octet ) @xmath0-s and check few sumrules to test symmetry assumptions .",
    "we compare with experiment and other calculations hoping more experimental decuplet @xmath0-s to be soon deduced .",
    "our values are thus predictions .",
    "one can view our calculation in the spirit of large @xmath1 or consider it as a relativistic mf calculation with a potential having af and confinement property built into it .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained from analytic large @xmath1 formulations which are exact calculations but assumes static limit as @xmath2 is infinite for @xmath11 .",
    "our @xmath2-s are finite , so the comparison is interesting - displaying the effect of the wave functions and whatever dynamics it contains .",
    "one needs to sum all planar gluon exchange diagrams to deduce an effective interquark potential .",
    "analytic derivation of such a sum being absent , a potential like richardson potential is chosen from meson phenomenology and then tested for baryons and quark stars @xcite v(r )  =  -n_c+12n_c 633 - 2n_f[eq : richard ] @xmath12 is colour contribution , @xmath1 is number of colours (= 3 ) , @xmath13 is number of flavours (= 3 ) .",

    "also the strange star calculation improves @xcite , - increasing the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath23 in debye screening term .",
    "this is more consistent in the framework of the star calculation in view of the findings of @xcite where the density dependence of quark masses is found from @xmath23 .",

    "the coupled differential equations are to be solved self consistently .",

    "the centre - of - mass ( cm ) momentum is not well - defined in rhf solutions and this entails a spurious contribution from the cm kinetic energy to the total energy . since the relative importance of this effect increases as the number of particles decreases , it is necessary to correct it for systems formed of few particles .",
    "this has been done here by extending the peierls - yoccoz procedure of nuclear physics .",
    "the spurious contribution is denoted by @xmath43 and the baryon mass m is @xmath44 - @xmath43 .",
    "the peierls - yoccoz procedure corrects the energy but for @xmath0 - correct boosted wave functions are needed .",
    "this is discussed in the reference @xcite . boosting is not attempted in the present paper since our ultimate aim is to use the procedure for a large system , a massive star , where these corrections are not relevant .",
    "therefore , our results on masses of decuplet and octet baryons , take care of center of mass correction but not for the magnetic moments",
    ". still , we are able to compare our calculated @xmath45 with infinite mass static large @xmath1 models which also do not involve centre of mass correction .    energy differences between decuplet and octet baryons are obtained using the simplest idea of instanton physics @xcite where @xmath46 is the instanton induced potential between a ( u , d ) pair and @xmath47 is the same between a ( u , s ) or ( d , s ) pair .",

    "the logic behind this approximation is as follows . for large @xmath68",
    "the interaction between any given pair of quarks is negligible - of order @xmath69 .",
    "but the total potential experienced by any one quark is of order one , since any quark interacts with @xmath68 other quarks , each with strength @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the total potential experienced by any one quark is of order one , but is a sum of many small , separately insignificant terms . as in statistical mechanics , when a quantity is a sum of many insignificant terms , the fluctuation around the mean value are very small .",
    "thus , the potential experienced by one quark , apart from being of order one , can be regarded as a background , c - number potential - the fluctuations are negligible . to find the ground state baryon ,",
    "each quark should be placed in the ground state of the average potential that it experiences . by symmetry , the average potential is the same for each quark , so we should place each quark in the same ground state of the average potential \" .",
    "the beauty of mf approximation is that it can be used in both 3 quark system ( baryon ) and many quark system ( quark stars ) .",
