    "the surfaces span , and the surfaces are independent . in the following we only consider pure states based on parallel copies of essential @xmath76 unless otherwise is specified . + the lemmata below follow from proposition [ parallel ] .",
    "( shifting ) [ switch ] let @xmath77 be a dotted sphere in @xmath78 and @xmath79 be a white sphere parallel to @xmath77 .",

    "however , a pure state with a dot is zero if the number of component is greater than one : while shifting of a dot from a sphere to an adjacent sphere causes sign change , it is on the other hand isotopic to the original state , thus the same element in the module .    next we need to see that our skeins are independent . by proposition [ pure ]",
    "the skeins @xmath71 are all independent .",
    "we just need to show that @xmath86 is independent from the @xmath71 . to this end",

    "if a surface is the result of taking the disjoint union a family of spheres with dots bounding balls and compressible tori without a dot that are nullhomologous in @xmath88 , with @xmath86 or a torus without a dot that represents something nonzero in @xmath88 send it to @xmath89 where @xmath62 is the number of torus components .",

    "the module @xmath94 has a basis consisting of the empty surface , parallel copies of the tori paramatrized above without a dot , and single copies of the tori above carrying one dot .",
    "in this section we investigate if there is any other choice for the constants in bar - natan skein relations as in definition [ def ] .",
    "first let @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 by using the relation ( 2 ) in definition [ def ] we have @xmath98 and @xmath99 we need @xmath100 to be invertible in @xmath16 if @xmath101 , then we have @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . in the case",

    "+ first , a graph corresponding to a pure state is admissible since a vertex @xmath240 corresponds to a surface with boundary components specified by the edges that connect to @xmath232 , where a loop will give two circles , thus the contribution is zero in @xmath242-homology . on the other hand , for a given admissible graph with the data , the circles corresponding to the edges attached to a vertex must bound a surface in @xmath31 by the admissibility condition .",
    "one many randomly choose circles for each edge as many as the weights . .",
    "an admissible graph @xmath229 determines a pure state in the filtration @xmath247 if @xmath248 . for the sake of notation economy",
    ", we consider admissible graphs as if they are pure states in @xmath170 .",
    "the lemmas [ trivalent ] , [ loop ] lead to the following formulas for the graphs .",
    "* proof * + we maintain the notation used in the previous subsection regarding @xmath170 .",
    "let @xmath267 , and @xmath268 .",
    "since we already know that states consisting of incompressible surfaces without dots are linearly independent , we show that the preimages of the basis @xmath269 of @xmath257 with respect to the fibration map @xmath270 are linearly independent in @xmath271 .",
    "assume that the component that the dot in each @xmath223 is placed is arbitrarily chosen and fixed for all .",
    "we show that the states @xmath272 , where @xmath273 are linearly independent in @xmath271 .",
    "we proceed in a similar way to proposition [ independence ] .",
    "let @xmath274 be defined as follows : for a state @xmath79 , if it is a disjoint union of @xmath275 possibly with the dot dislocated , and singly dotted spheres bounding balls , and @xmath62 compressible white tori , let @xmath276 , where @xmath136 is the number of shifts that the dot in @xmath79 makes to arrive to the default position of the dot in @xmath277 within the surfaces corresponding to @xmath275 .",
    "note that shifting of a dot among the components of the surface @xmath275 is fully expressed in terms of components of the curve in @xmath223 , which has been discussed earlier . since @xmath223 is not zero ,",
    "@xmath136 is well - defined modulo @xmath12 .",
    "now we check that @xmath278 is compatible with the bn relations modulo grading .",
    "the only non - trivial relation to check is ( 2 ) .",
    "let      where by these equalities we denote pure states with local modifications illustrated by the right hand sides .",
    "we need to show that @xmath282 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath283 does not have any spheres bounding balls , or tori bounding solid tori .",
    "if the underlining surfaces of @xmath283 is compressible , or incompressible but not isotopic to that of @xmath275 , both side of the equality is zero .",
    "otherwise @xmath284 , thus we have @xmath285 the number of the components of @xmath286 is @xmath287 , thus @xmath288 in @xmath271 .",
    "thus we proved the independence of @xmath272 in @xmath271 , which implies @xmath289 .",
    "+   + next we want to understand the horizontal surfaces .",
    "if @xmath3 has a horizontal surface , let @xmath290 be a connected horizontal surface so that @xmath291 .",
    "orienting the fibers of @xmath3 we can define a map @xmath292 by following the fibers in the positive direction .",
    "the map @xmath293 has finite order and @xmath294/\\sim$ ] , where we identify @xmath295 with @xmath296 is homeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath297 denote the invariant part of @xmath298 under the action of @xmath293 .",
    "for the sake of computation we orient @xmath290 and @xmath3 and @xmath31 . if @xmath299 is any horizontal surface the degree of @xmath300 is an integer @xmath301 . making @xmath299 transverse to @xmath290 we can take their oriented intersection and view it as defining an element @xmath302 of @xmath297 .",
    "hence we can assign to any connected oriented horizontal surface the ordered pair @xmath303 .",
    "the image of this map is all indivisible elements , which we denote @xmath304 .",
    "two connected oriented surfaces are isotopic if and only if they have the same image in @xmath304 .",
    "let @xmath305 be all elements of @xmath304 with @xmath306 , these points are in one to one correspondence with the isotopy classes of unoriented horizontal surfaces in @xmath3 . if @xmath307 , let @xmath308 denote @xmath62 parallel copies of @xmath309 without dots .",
