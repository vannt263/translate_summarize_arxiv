    "most studies on the feeding and feedback mechanisms of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) presently available in the literature are based on optical observations , which are affected by dust obscuration , a problem that can be softened by the use of infrared observations .",
    "another advantage of infrared spectral region is that , besides observing ionized gas emission , we can also observe emission from molecular gas ( h@xmath10 ) .",
    "our group , _ agnifs _",
    "( for agn integral field spectroscopy ) , has been developing a project to map both the feeding and feedback in nearby agn using near - infrared integral field spectroscopic observations mostly with the instrument nifs at the gemini north telescope .",
    "the main findings of our group so far have been that the molecular gas  traced by k - band @xmath16 emission , and the ionized gas traced by hi recombination lines and [ feii ] emission , present distinct flux distributions and kinematics .",
    "usually the @xmath16 emitting gas is restricted to the plane of the galaxy , while the ionized gas extends also to high latitudes and is associated with the radio emission , when present @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 kinematics is usually dominated by rotation , including in some cases , streaming motions towards the nucleus , while the kinematics of the ionized gas , and in particular of the [ feii ] emitting gas , shows also , in many cases , a strong outflowing component associated with radio jets from the agn .",
    "similar results have been found using the spectrograph for integral field observations in the near infrared ( sinfoni ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "@xcite found molecular gas inflows towards the nucleus of ngc1097 and @xcite mapped similar h@xmath10 inflows feeding and obscuring the active nucleus of ngc1068 , while @xcite mapped outflows in ionized gas around 7 active galatic nuclei .    in this work",

    "mrk766 was selected for this study because : ( i ) it presents strong near - ir emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the data reduction procedure included trimming of the images , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength and spatial distortion calibrations .",
    "we also removed the telluric bands and flux calibrated the frames by interpolating a black body function to the spectrum of the telluric standard star .",
    "these procedures were executed using tasks contained in the nifs software package which is part of gemini iraf package , as well as generic iraf tasks . in order to check our flux calibration , we extracted a nuclear spectrum with the same aperture of a previous spectrum of the galaxy by @xcite .",

    "the flux values ( as well as those of the central wavelength and width of the profile , see next sections ) were obtained by the fit of the profiles using both gaussian and gauss - hermite ( gh ) series .",
    "we found out that the latter gave better fits to most lines , except for the [ six ] line , for which the gh fits introduced extra wings in some regions where the line was weak .",

    "the resulting masses are @xmath71 7.6@xmath72 and @xmath73 1.32@xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "the above values are similar to those we have obtained in previous studies , which are in the range @xmath76 m@xmath77 m@xmath781.7@xmath79 m@xmath80 and 66m@xmath77 m@xmath813300 m@xmath80 , respectively .    the mass of molecular gas is thus 10@xmath82 times smaller than that of the ionized gas but , as discussed in @xcite , this h@xmath10 mass represents only that of warm gas emitting in the near - ir .",
    "the total mass of molecular gas is dominated by the cold gas , and the usual proxy to estimate the cold h@xmath10 mass has been the co emission .",
    "a number of studies have derived the ratio between the cold and warm h@xmath10 gas masses by comparing the masses obtained using the co and near - ir emission . @xcite",

    "more recently , @xcite compiled from the literature values of mcold derived from co observations and h@xmath102.12@xmath5 m luminosities for a larger number of galaxies , covering a wider range of luminosities , morphological and nuclear activity types . from that",

    "all the velocity fields shown in fig .  [ velocity ] suggest rotation in the inner 450pc of mrk766 . in order to obtain the systemic velocity , orientation of the line of nodes and an estimate for the enclosed mass",
    ", we fitted a model of circular orbits in a plane to the @xmath7 and h@xmath92 m velocity fields .",
    "the expression for the circular velocity is given by @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the projected distance from the nucleus in the plane of the sky , @xmath95 is the corresponding position angle , @xmath96 is the mass inside @xmath94 , @xmath97 is the newtow s gravitational constant , @xmath98 is the systemic velocity , @xmath99 is the inclination of the disc ( @xmath100 for a face - on disc ) , @xmath101 is the position angle of the line of nodes and @xmath102 is a scale length projected in the plane of the sky .    the location of the kinematical center was not allowed to vary , being fixed to the position of the peak of the continuum .",
    "the equation above contains five free parameters , which can be determined by fitting the model to the observations .",
    "this was done using the levenberg - marquardt least - squares fitting algorithm , in which initial guesses are given for the free parameters .",
    "the best fit model for pa@xmath11 is shown in fig.[residuals1 ] ( top - left panel ) and the best fit model for h@xmath92 m in fig.[residuals2 ] . in both figures",
    "we show the residual maps ( observed velocity field - model ) for [ feii ] ( bottom - left panel ) , @xmath16 ( bottom - right panel ) and @xmath7 ( top - right panel ) .",
    "the parameters derived from the fit of the pa@xmath11 are : the systemic velocity corrected to the heliocentric reference frame @xmath103kms@xmath1 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 pc .",
    "we can compare the near - ir line - emitting gas kinematics with results obtained in the optical at larger scales .",
    "@xcite present long - slit spectroscopy of mrk  766 at kpc scales with the slit oriented along pa@xmath108 .",
    "they found that the kinematic of the high - excitation gas ( traced by the [ oiii]@xmath109 emission ) is more perturbed than that of the low - ionization gas ( traced by h@xmath110 and h@xmath11 ) , showing radial motions consistent with gas outflows from the nucleus .",
    "the low - ionization gas seems to be dominated by rotation in the plane of the galaxy with a velocity amplitude of @xmath27130  kms@xmath1 . at distances smaller than 15 from the nucleus , the velocity amplitude is @xmath11150kms@xmath1 , which is somewhat smaller than the amplitude that we have derived .",
    "this is expected , since the slit used by @xcite was not oriented along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite quote a photometric major axis orientation of 105@xmath112 , based on an large scale continuum image at @xmath45960 .",

    "[ galaxia ] shows that mrk766 presents a bar with size of 4.5  kpc .",
    "the orientation of the bar is similar to that of the photometric major axis considered by @xcite . as the bar is broad an luminous and the outer parts of the galaxy are faint , we believe they have mistakenly concluded that the direction of the bar was that of the major axis .",
    "the systemic velocity and @xmath99 are in reasonable agreement with the values listed at the hyperleda @xcite and ned databases ( @xmath114kms@xmath1 and @xmath115 and @xmath96 and @xmath102 are similar to values found for other seyfert galaxies using the same model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . for the h@xmath92",
    "m fit we found a much more compact velocity field than that of pa@xmath11 , with a scale lenght @xmath116 pc .",
    "the other parameters were practically the same .",
    "this signature of a more compact rotating disk in h@xmath10 than in pa@xmath11 , is similar to that we have found for mrk1066 @xcite , indicating that h@xmath10 presents a `` colder '' and more ordered kinematics .",
    "an exception is the region to the south - west , which seems to show a detached kinematics .",
    "this region is probably a molecular cloud that is not in the galaxy disc .",
    "the residuals shown in fig.[residuals1 ] show blueshifts in the borders of the measured field in pa@xmath11 to the north  north - east of the nucleus which we attribute to poor fits of the lines in this region .",
    "more significant are the redshift residuals to the south - south - east , a region where the largest residuals in the [ feii ] velocity field are also observed .",
    "there is where the enhanced [ feii ] velocity dispersion and the radio structure are also located .",
    "in addition , in this same region , the [ feii ] flux distributions in the channel maps of fig . 8 show both blueshifts and redshifts , with velocities of up to 250 kms1 .",
    "we interpret these results as being due to emission of gas in a one - sided outflow oriented along the position angle @xmath2 135@xmath18 .",
    "the observation of both blueshifts and redshifts in the channel maps supports that its axis lies approximately in the plane of the sky .",
    "the main residuals in the h@xmath10 velocity field that are not in the borders of the field ( where the line fits are poorer ) are the redshifts observed to the north  northwest . as this is the near side of the galaxy , we speculate that these residuals could be due to inflows in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "these residuals are seen along the direction of the bar at pa@xmath117 .",
    "we speculate that they may be associated to inflows along the bar , as predicted by theoretical models ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and as measured in a few cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in previous studies ,",
    "we have found inflows along nuclear dusty spirals @xcite .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations by @xcite have shown that if a central smbh is present , shocks can extend all the way to the vicinity of the smbh and generate gas inflows consistent with the accretion rates inferred in local agn .",
    "similar residuals are also seen in the pa@xmath11 and [ feii ] residual maps : redshifts to north ",
    "northwest , also suggesting inflows .",
    "we rule out the possibility of these redshifts being due to a counterpart of the south - east outflow once it is observed in redshift over the far side of the galaxy .",
    "a possible counterpart should be in blueshift and behind the near side of the galaxy plane .",
    "we do not see such a component ; one possibility is that it is hidden by the galaxy plane .",
    "the residuals shown in fig.[residuals2 ] , after the subtraction of the circular velocity model fitted to the h@xmath10 velocity field shows similar residuals to the south  south - east for pa@xmath11 and [ feii ] , but show additional residuals in the northern part of the field . in the case of the h@xmath10 residuals , redshifts are observed also in the region to the south - west , that we have interpreted as due to a detached cloud , that is probably not in the galaxy plane .      with the goal of quantifying the feedback from the agn in mrk766 , we estimate the ionized - gas mass outflow rate through a circular cross section with radius @xmath118pc located at a distance of @xmath119 from the nucleus to the south - east .",
    "this geometry corresponds to a conical outflow with an opening angle of @xmath2 64@xmath112 , estimated from fig.[sliceferro ] .",
    "the mass outflow rate can be obtained using : @xmath120 and the filling factor ( @xmath121 ) can be obtained from @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the proton mass , @xmath124 the electron density , @xmath125 is velocity of the outflowing gas and @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the luminosity and the emission coefficient of pa@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath128@xmath58 , @xmath1291.43@xmath130 erg s@xmath1 , @xmath131 erg @xmath132s@xmath1 and @xmath133kms@xmath134kms@xmath1 where @xmath135 is the angle between the wall of the cone ( from where we observe the line - of - sight velocity component of 147kms@xmath1 ) and the plane of sky .",
    "the latter velocity value was obtained directly from the channel maps considering that the structure seen to south - east is due to the emission of the walls of the cone . as described above , the axis of the cone seems to lie close to the plane of the sky . from the estimated aperture of the cone ,",
    "we adopt a maximum angle between the cone and the plane of the sky of @xmath136 . under these assumptions",
    "we obtain @xmath137 and then @xmath138 yr@xmath1 .",
    "the value found here for @xmath139 is in good agreement with those found in @xcite , which range from 0.1 to 10@xmath140 yr@xmath1 , it is of the same order of that obtained by @xcite , of 8@xmath141 yr@xmath1 , and is also within the range of the values found by @xcite , which range from 2.5 to 120 @xmath141 yr@xmath1 .",
    "following @xcite , we can use the above mass outflow rate to estimate the kinetic power of the outflow using : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the velocity of the outflowing gas and @xmath42 is its velocity dispersion . using @xmath144kms@xmath1 ( from fig.[disper ] ) and @xmath145kms@xmath1 we obtain @xmath146ergs@xmath1 which is in good agreement with the values obtained for seyfert galaxies and compact radio sources @xcite .",
    "this value is also similar to that obtained for mrk1157 @xcite , of @xmath147ergs@xmath1 , it is within the range of those found by @xcite , between 0.6 to 50@xmath148ergs@xmath1 .    in order to compare the above value of @xmath149 with the bolometric luminosity , we estimate the latter as 10 times the x - ray luminosity , of 3.5@xmath148 erg s@xmath1 @xcite , resulting in @xmath150 0.08 l@xmath151 .    finally , we can calculate the mass acretion rate to feed the active nucleus from@xcite @xmath152 where , @xmath153 is the nuclear bolometric luminosity , @xmath154 is the efficiency of conversion of the rest mass energy of the accreted material into radiation and @xmath155 is the light speed .",
    "the bolometric luminosity was already estimated as 3.5@xmath156 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "assuming @xmath1570.1 which is a typical value for a geometrially thin , optically thick accretion disc @xcite , we obtain an accretion rate of @xmath1581.4@xmath2810@xmath159 m@xmath13yr@xmath1 , which is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the mass outflow rate , a ratio compared with those found in our previous studies .",
    "we have mapped the gas flux distribution , excitation and kinematics from the inner @xmath2450pc radius of the seyfert1 galaxy mrk766 using near - ir j - and k - band integral - field spectroscopy at a spatial resolution of @xmath260pc ( 020 ) .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are :    * the emission - line flux distributions of molecular hydrogen h@xmath10 and low - ionization gas are extended to at least @xmath2300pc from the nucleus ; * the h@xmath10 line emission is most extended along pa=70@xmath112 , which is close to the position angle of the line of nodes of the gas kinematics ; * the [ feii ] emission is most extended approximately along the perpendicular direction to the line of nodes of the gas kinematics ; * the coronal line [ six ] emission is resolved and extends up to @xmath2150pc from the nucleus ; * the emission - line ratios [ feii]/@xmath7 and @xmath32/br@xmath9 show a mixture of starburst and seyfert type excitation ; the seyfert values dominates at the nucleus , to the north - west and in an arc - shaped region between 02 and 06 to the south - east where a radio jet has been observed , while starburst values are present at the nucleus and other regions ; * the enhancement of the [ feii]/[pii ] line ratio at the location of the radio jet , as well as the corresponding increase in the [ fe ii ] flux and velocity dispersion support a contribution from shocks to the gas excitation in the arc - shaped region to the south - east ; in the remaining regions , the favoured excitation mechanism is uv radiation from young stars ; * the @xmath16 gas kinematics is dominated by rotation in a compact disc with a velocity amplitude of 140 km s@xmath1 and low velocity dispersion ( 40 - 60 km s@xmath1 , consistent with orbital motion in the plane of the galaxy ) ; * the kinematics of the ionized gas is also dominated by rotation , but channel maps in [ fe ii ] show in addition an outflowing component to the south - east , with an axis lying close to the plane of the sky reaching velocities of @xmath27 300 km s@xmath1 , probably associated with the radio jet . * the mass outflow rate in ionized gas is estimated to be @xmath2 10.7 m@xmath80 yr@xmath1 and the power of the outflow estimated to be @xmath160 ; * the mass of ionized gas is @xmath161 while the mass of the hot molecular gas is @xmath162 and the estimated cold molecular gas mass is m@xmath90 @xmath2 9.8@xmath2810@xmath91 .",
    "+ the distinct flux distributions and kinematics of the h@xmath10 and [ feii ] emitting gas , with the first more restricted to the plane of the galaxy and in compact rotation and the second related with the radio jet and in outflow are common characteristics of 8 seyfert galaxies ( eso428-g14 , ngc4051 , ngc7582 , ngc4151 , mrk1066 , mrk1157 , mrk79 and mrk766 ) we have studied so far using similar integral - field observations and 2 others ( circinus and ngc2110 ) using long - slit observations .",

    "<S> we have mapped the emission - line flux distributions and ratios as well as the gaseous kinematics of the inner 450 pc radius of the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk766 using integral field near - ir j- and k@xmath0-band spectra obtained with the gemini nifs at a spatial resolution of 60 pc and velocity resolution of 40 kms@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> emission - line flux distributions in ionized and molecular gas extend up to @xmath2 300 pc from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> coronal [ six]@xmath3 m line emission is resolved , being extended up to 150 pc from the nucleus . at the highest flux levels , </S>",
    "<S> the [ feii]@xmath41.257@xmath5 m line emission is most extended to the south - east , where a radio jet has been observed.the emission - line ratios [ feii]@xmath6m/@xmath7 and @xmath8m / br@xmath9 show a mixture of starburst and seyfert excitation ; the seyfert excitation dominates at the nucleus , to the north - west and in an arc - shaped region between 02 and 06 to the south - east at the location of the radio jet . a contribution from shocks at this location </S>",
    "<S> is supported by enhanced [ feii]/[pii ] line ratios and increased [ feii ] velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the gas velocity field is dominated by rotation that is more compact for h@xmath10 than for pa@xmath11 , indicating that the molecular gas has a colder kinematics and is located in the galaxy plane . </S>",
    "<S> there is about 10@xmath12 m@xmath13 of hot h@xmath10 , implying @xmath2 10@xmath14 m@xmath13 of cold molecular gas . at the location of the radio jet </S>",
    "<S> , we observe an increase in the [ feii ] velocity dispersion ( 150 km s@xmath1 ) , as well as both blueshift and redshifts in the channel maps , supporting the presence of an outflow there . </S>",
    "<S> the ionized gas mass outflow rate is estimated to be @xmath2 10 m@xmath13 yr@xmath1 , and the power of the outflow @xmath2 0.08 l@xmath15 .    </S>",
