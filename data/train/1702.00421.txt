    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ static properties of integrable quantum many - body systems are well understood @xcite . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> , dynamical questions in these systems continue to be a major challenge in many areas of modern physics and range from fundamental questions in statistical physics to applied questions for a specific class of materials . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , integrable systems feature a macroscopic number of ( quasi-)local conservation laws @xcite and any overlap with these conserved quantities leads to the breakdown of conventional equilibration and thermalization @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> such overlap is not warranted for all possible initial states , observables , or model parameters and integrability does not rigorously exclude the existence of thermodynamic relaxation such as exponential decay or diffusive transport . </S>",
    "<S> this type of relaxation , however , is often traced back to chaos @xcite , being absent in integrable systems .    in this context , </S>",
    "<S> two important and extensively studied examples are ( i ) the one - dimensional xxz spin-@xmath1 model and ( ii ) the ( fermi-)hubbard chain . as typical for integrable systems , </S>",
    "<S> the energy current is ( i ) strictly or ( ii ) at least partially conserved @xcite such that energy flow is ballistic at any finite temperature @xcite , as signaled by a nonzero drude weight within linear - response theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , a much richer dynamical phase diagram develops for other transport quantities . in case ( i ) of the xxz spin-@xmath1 chain , the spin current is not strictly conserved . while the partial conservation of this current and a nonzero drude have been proven analytically below the isotropic point @xcite , strong numerical evidence for a vanishing drude weight and nonballistic dynamics has been provided above this point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for the latter regime , clear signatures of diffusion have been reported in various works @xcite . in case ( ii ) of the hubbard chain </S>",
    "<S> , the situation appears to be similar for charge transport . </S>",
    "<S> even though clarifying the existence of a nonzero drude weight has turned out to be hard task analytically @xcite , numerical studies point to a vanishing drude weight for strong particle - particle interactions @xcite . while signatures of diffusion have been observed for such interactions also @xcite , a direct detection of the characteristic gaussian broadening is lacking .    </S>",
    "<S> the intention of our letter is to clarify the existence of charge diffusion in the hubbard chain . for this purpose , we study the nonequilibrium dynamics as resulting for a convenient class of initial states . </S>",
    "<S> these initial states are pure and realize density profiles where a peak with the maximum amplitude possible is located in the center of the chain and lies on top of a homogeneous many - body background . </S>",
    "<S> first , we focus on a subclass with random internal degrees of freedom and rely on the well - known concept of typicality @xcite to obtain the real - time broadening of density profiles in the linear - response regime . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> our large - scale numerical simulations for chains as long as @xmath0 sites allow us to unveil the existence of remarkably clean charge diffusion , as a key result of our letter . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we extend our analysis to initial states without any randomness and show that the dynamical behavior is stable against varying details of the initial conditions . this stability is another central result of our work and reveals that exactly the same charge diffusion emerges in a far - from - equilibrium setup . </S>",
    "<S> these findings clearly demonstrate that thermodynamic relaxation can occur in integrable systems .    _ model and observables . _ in one spatial dimension and with periodic boundary conditions , the hamiltonian of the hubbard model reads @xmath2 , @xmath3 where the operator @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) creates ( annihilates ) at site @xmath6 a fermion with spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the hopping matrix element , and @xmath9 is the number of sites . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath10 is the local occupation number and @xmath11 is the strength of the on - site interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for all values , this model is integrable and the total particle numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 are strictly conserved quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we do not restrict ourselves to a particular particle sector , i.e. , we study the case @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that , via the jordan - wigner transformation , this model can be mapped onto a spin-@xmath1 two - leg ladder of length @xmath9 , with xy exchange in the legs and ising exchange in the rungs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this spin model is used in our numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the real - time dynamics of the local occupation numbers @xmath15 and investigate the expectation values @xmath16 $ ] for the density matrix @xmath17 at time @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> ( it is important to note that @xmath19 . ) doing so , we can follow the broadening of nonequilibrium density profiles , as realized by the preparation of a proper initial state @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> .    _ initial states . _ in this letter , we prepare pure initial states @xmath21 . to specify our @xmath22 , it is convenient to consider the common eigenbasis of all @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> . let @xmath23 be this basis . </S>",
    "<S> then , our initial states read @xmath24 where @xmath25 are complex and yet arbitrary coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath26 projects only onto states with a spin - up particle in the middle of the chain , @xmath27 has the maximum value possible .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on two particular choices for the coefficients @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> first , we choose all @xmath25 to be the same number . </S>",
    "<S> second , we choose the @xmath25 at random according to the unitary invariant haar measure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this choice means in practice that real and imaginary part of the @xmath25 are independently drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean . for both , the random and equal choice of the @xmath25 , all @xmath28 take on their equilibrium value , and still @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the initial density profile features a central peak on top of a homogeneous many - particle background .    </S>",
    "<S> a very similar form for the density profile also results for the state @xmath30 then , due to the additional projection , @xmath31 also for equal and random @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the density profiles @xmath32 are identical for @xmath33 and all later times @xmath34 as well , see @xcite for initial displacement .     for a _ typical _ initial state @xmath35 ( where all spin - down occupation numbers @xmath36 ) in the one - dimensional hubbard model with @xmath37 sites and different interaction strengths : ( a ) @xmath38 , ( b ) @xmath39 , ( c ) @xmath40 . while the broadening in ( a ) points to charge diffusion , the broadening in ( c ) is clearly ballistic . ]    </S>",
    "<S> all initial states introduced have to be considered as far - from - equilibrium states : they are not only pure but also have maximum @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , however , the dynamics of @xmath22 in eq.([single ] ) with random @xmath25 can be connected to the linear - response kubo formula , since the underlying @xmath42 is a so - called typical state @xcite , see also refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the concept of typicality . exploiting this typicality </S>",
    "<S> allows one to derive the relation @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44/ 4^l$ ] is the thermodynamic average at formally infinite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for a typical state , the nonequilibrium expectation value is directly related to an equilibrium correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> this fact enables a connection to the kubo formula via the variance @xmath45 ^ 2 \\ , , \\label{variance}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 excludes the equilibrium background and is normalized to @xmath47 . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the time derivative of this variance satisfies @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total current of the spin - up particles and the quantity @xmath50 plays the role of a time - dependent diffusion coefficient . for @xmath51 , [ @xmath52 = 0 $ ] </S>",
    "<S> necessarily leads to ballistic scaling @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for large @xmath55 , signatures of diffusive scaling @xmath56 and @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> have been reported in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , however , a systematic analysis beyond the mere width of the density profile is lacking and the central issue of our letter .    </S>",
    "<S> _ numerical technique and results . </S>",
    "<S> _ from a numerical point of view , the hubbard chain is challenging since the hilbert - space dimension @xmath58 grows rapidly with @xmath9 , e.g. , much faster than the also exponential increase @xmath59 in case of a spin-@xmath1 chain . as a consequence , exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> is only feasible for a few lattice sites and a real - space experiment like the one done in our letter would not be reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we proceed differently and profit from the fact that we only need to deal with pure states . the time evolution of these states can be obtained by forward - propagation methods such as fourth - order runge - kutta @xcite or more sophisticated schemes such as trotter decompositions or chebyshev polynomials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a second - order trotter formula with a time step @xmath60 , sufficient to reach very good agreement with chebyshev - polynomial algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> a massively parallelized implementation of this formula allows us to treat hubbard chains as long as @xmath61 sites . for this system size and a maximum time @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> , the simulation takes about @xmath63 hours when using @xmath64 double - thread cores . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , apart from the @xmath61 data depicted in fig.[fig2 ] , we focus on @xmath65 to reduce computational costs at least a bit .     as a function of site @xmath6 at various times @xmath66 for a hubbard chain of length @xmath61 and with a strong interaction @xmath67 , shown in a semi - log plot ( symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( the initial state @xmath22 is the same as the one in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . ) </S>",
    "<S> the data can be described by gaussian fits over several orders of magnitude ( curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) linear - response result for the time evolution of the diffusion coefficient @xmath50 and profile width @xmath68 , as obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for length @xmath69 and the same interaction @xmath38 ( curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation @xmath70 , as resulting from the gaussian fits in ( a ) , is indicated for comparison ( symbols ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> now , we turn to our numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the initial state @xmath71 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ single ] ) with a random choice of the coefficients @xmath25 , i.e. , a typical state . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that we consider a single realization of the @xmath25 and do not perform any kind of averaging . </S>",
    "<S> still , we allow the @xmath25 to be different for each simulation . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a)-(c ) we depict our results for the spin - up occupation numbers @xmath72(t ) for a hubbard chain of length @xmath37 and with different interactions @xmath38 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , in a 2d time - space density plot . </S>",
    "<S> several comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> first , for the noninteracting case @xmath51 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( c ) , the real - time broadening of @xmath75 is clearly linear and , as discussed above , has to occur due to the strict conservation of the particle current . </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced jets visible are typical for free - particle cases @xcite and propagate fast without any scattering until they eventually hit the boundary of the chain at short times @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> second , for the interacting cases @xmath38 , @xmath73 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , these jets and the linear broadening as well disappear , i.e. , the dynamics is not ballistic . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in contrast , the flow of energy is ballistic for arbitrary @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , the broadening is the slower the larger @xmath11 because scattering becomes stronger as @xmath11 increases . in particular , for the largest @xmath38 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) and the maximum time @xmath77 calculated , the overall width of @xmath78 is still smaller than the chain length </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , we can exclude trivial finite - size effects for such times @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> for the same model parameters as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] but for another and _ untypical _ initial state @xmath22 ( where all spin - down occupation numbers @xmath36 once again ) . compared to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , jet - like behavior is enhanced in ( c ) while no significant difference is visible in ( a ) . ]    to gain insight into the dynamics at large @xmath79 , we show in fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) the site dependence of the profile @xmath75 for various times @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath73 , and for an even larger system size @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by subtracting from @xmath75 the equilibrium value @xmath83 and using a semi - log plot , to visualize also the outer tails of the profile . </S>",
    "<S> it is intriguing to see that , for all times @xmath18 depicted , the profiles can be described very well by gaussians @xmath84 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the standard deviation @xmath70 occurs as the only free parameter and is adjusted by fitting . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent fits over several orders of magnitude are a central result of our letter and already provide strong evidence for the existence of diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> still , however , @xmath70 needs to scale as @xmath85 .    for a final conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) the time dependence of @xmath70 and compare to the linear - response @xmath68 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ d ] ) , as resulting from the @xmath50 calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the same interaction @xmath79 and length @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> while the perfect agreement illustrates the high accuracy of the typicality relation , this agreement implies that the linear - response result @xmath56 @xcite also holds for our nonequilibrium dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , diffusion clearly exists . </S>",
    "<S> note that the same conclusion can be drawn for smaller interactions @xmath86 also @xcite , where finite - size effects are still negligibly small . for @xmath87 , </S>",
    "<S> however , significant finite - size effects are known to occur @xcite and a reliable conclusion on the thermodynamic limit @xmath88 is impossible on the basis of @xmath89 .     versus site @xmath6 for fixed times ( a ) @xmath90 , ( b ) @xmath91 for various initial states , i.e. , @xmath22 ( 1 ) and @xmath92 ( 2 ) with random ( r. ) and equal ( e. ) coefficients in the underlying superposition . </S>",
    "<S> as a guide to the eyes , gaussian fits are indicated ( for 1 , r. ) . while data for random initial states are practically indistinguishable , data for nonrandom initial states differ only very little . ]    </S>",
    "<S> next , we intend to shed light on the role of the specific initial - state realization , in particular on the influence of randomness . therefore , in a first step , we investigate the initial state @xmath22 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ single ] ) again but now with equal coefficients @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> recall that , while this nonrandom state has exactly the same initial density profile , the typicality relation does not need to hold any further . </S>",
    "<S> for this state , we repeat the calculation in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath65 sites and different interactions @xmath38 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and summarize the corresponding results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . in comparison to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , jet - like behavior for @xmath51 is enhanced in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( c ) and emerges now for @xmath93 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( b ) in addition . </S>",
    "<S> the same observation has been made for the xxz spin-@xmath1 chain below the isotropic point @xcite . remarkably , however , the diffusive behavior for @xmath38 in fig .  [ fig3 ] ( a ) turns out to be unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this observation is different to the one found for the xxz spin-@xmath1 chain above the isotropic point @xcite , where the impact of nonrandomness is strong .    </S>",
    "<S> the above finding suggests that charge diffusion for strong interactions @xmath11 is stable against varying details of the initial condition . to substantiate this suggestion </S>",
    "<S> , we finally extend our analysis to the initial state @xmath94 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ double ] ) and study both , random and equal coefficients @xmath25 . to repeat , these states have the same initial density profile @xmath95 but @xmath96 now . for system size @xmath37 , interaction @xmath38 , and two different times @xmath90 , @xmath73 , </S>",
    "<S> we compare in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] the distribution @xmath75 for these states with the one for the others . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , @xmath75 is practically indistinguishable for the two cases with random @xmath25 . even though not shown explicitly here </S>",
    "<S> , these two random cases also coincide for other values of @xmath11 @xcite . while the two equal cases in fig.[fig4 ] differ from the two random ones , this difference is minor in view of the semi - log plot used . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are another central result of our letter and clearly show that charge diffusion in the strong - interaction limit does not depend on the specific initial - state preparation , at least for the whole class of nonequilibrium states investigated .    </S>",
