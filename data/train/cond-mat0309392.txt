    "in condensed matter one finds three kinds of electrical dipoles : ( 1 ) permanent ( as in a molecular cluster of polar molecules , such as ch@xmath0cl ) , ( 2 ) diplacive ( as in batio@xmath0 ) , and ( 3 ) induced ( a cluster of benzene molecules in an external field ) .",
    "the unifying feature is that the dipole moments feel each other .",
    "their magnitudes and orientations depend on where the other dipoles are , in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "this paper argues that one should study the linear algebra , and particularly the eigenvector of maximum eigenvalue , of the dipole - dipole matrix @xmath1 which relates the induced electric field @xmath2 at the @xmath3th site @xmath4 to the dipoles @xmath5 at sites @xmath6 : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 . the insights obtained from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are illustrated below in some simple examples , and in an application to real materials with spontaneous electrical polarity , the octahedral tilt instability of reo@xmath0-type perovskite crystals .    of course , it must be acknowledged that not all properties of polar matter have much to do with the dipole moments of their molecules .",
    "for example , the water molecule has a dipole in vapor phase , and electrical polarity is a dominant effect in the interactions of water molecules with each other and with dissolved species .",
    "however , for near - neighbor pairs , it is not a good approximation to replace the polar charge distribution of water by a single dipole .",
    "a better approximation would use two dipoles , located along the two bonds , each pointing away from the oxygen toward one of the two hydrogens .",
    "the sum of these two dipoles is the total measured dipole moment of the water molecule .",
    "also , it would be not a very good approximation to assume that the two dipole moments of the water molecule are unchanged in their various chemical environments .",
    "induced polarity should be treated on top of permanent or displacive polarity , and this is done in the case of the octahedral tilt .",
    "a complete theory would not make any type of dipolar approximation , but would deal with the actual varying charge distribution of the molecules in detail .",
    "modern density functional theory does this well , but slowly , which motivates a search for a less complete but still sensible theory .",
    "the energy of a single molecule is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the polarizability and @xmath12 is an externally applied field .",
    "the actual dipole moment @xmath13 is fixed by the condition that the energy is minimum , which gives @xmath14 .",
    "now consider @xmath15 molecules , approximated as points , at chosen fixed positions @xmath4 .",
    "it costs energy @xmath16 to create a dipole @xmath17 on the @xmath3th site , but one gets back energy @xmath18 from the total field @xmath19 at the site , where @xmath20 may be spatially inhomogeneous , varying from site to site . the total energy , in a standard vector space notation , is @xmath21",
    "when there are @xmath15 sites , each with a dipole , then @xmath22 is a @xmath23 column vector containing all the components @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "notice that the interaction energy @xmath27 is reduced by a factor of 2 in the total energy , to avoid double counting . with no external field ,",
    "the system is stable if @xmath28 is a positive operator .",
    "equivalently , all eigenvalues of @xmath1 should be less than @xmath29 .    just as for the single molecule , the induced dipoles @xmath17 should minimize the total energy , @xmath30 the solution is @xmath31",
    "this is a generalized version of the clausius - mossotti law @xcite .",
    "an alternate notation , @xmath32 uses an expansion in eigenvectors , where @xmath33 is the eigenvector of @xmath1 with eigenvalue @xmath34 .",
    "if the overlap @xmath35 is not zero , the eigenvector of largest eigenvalue @xmath36 may dominate the response .",
    "if @xmath36 increases to become equal to @xmath29 , then the system becomes unstable .",
    "it will develop a spontaneous polarization , with a pattern @xmath22 proportional to the corresponding eigenvector @xmath37 .",
    "higher order terms not considered here are needed to determine the magnitude of the spontaneous moment .",
    "for pedagogical purposes , let us examine the @xmath38 matrix @xmath1 which describes the interaction between two dipoles separated by distance @xmath39 ; to be specific , let @xmath40 point along the @xmath41 axis . even without writing the matrix , we can find all six eigenvectors by simple physical reasoning .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath1 are those patterns of dipoles such that the induced field at each dipole is parallel and proportional to the dipole itself .",
    "consider the patterns in fig .",
    "1.*a - d*. the field @xmath42 lies along the @xmath43-axis if @xmath44 points along @xmath43 , and lies in the @xmath45 plane antiparallel to @xmath44 if @xmath44 lies in the @xmath45 plane",
    ". therefore vectors lying along @xmath41 separate from those lying in the @xmath45 plane , and by cylindrical symmetry , eigenvectors in the @xmath45 plane are doubly degenerate .",
    "the degenerate pair can be chosen so that one lies along @xmath46 and one along @xmath47 . to save space , we project the problem onto the 2d @xmath48 plane .",
    "the resulting @xmath49 matrix is @xmath50 the eigenvalues are ( 2,1,-1,-2 ) in units of @xmath51 , and the corresponding eigenvectors , shown in fig.1.*a - d * , are @xmath52 these eigenvectors all have different symmetries . under inversion and mirror reflection in the central @xmath45 plane ,",
    "the vectors have @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 symmetry , respectively .",
    "[ 0.5 ] are shown for two dipoles . in * e ,",
    "f , h * , the eigenvector of largest eigenvalue is shown for three dipoles . in * e * , the dipoles all have equal length . in * g * and",
    "* i * the optimal patterns ( not eigenvectors ! ) for fixed length dipoles are shown , nearly agreeing with the eigenvectors of * f * and * h*. the vectors in * h * and * i * differ in angle by about 3@xmath57.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .2 in    the isotropic heisenberg interaction @xmath58 for two spins has exactly the same eigenvectors but very different eigenvalues . for @xmath59 ( ferromagnetic exchange ) , states * a * and * c * are low energy states , equal in energy , and states * b * and * d * are high energy states , also equal in energy . for @xmath59 ( antiferromagnetic exchange ) ,",
    "the reverse is true . for magnetic systems",
    "( the o@xmath60 molecule is a nice example ) , the exchange energy is much larger than the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the ground state of o@xmath60 has two outer electrons , polarized ferromagnetically ( @xmath61 ) , and only a tiny spin - orbit - induced preference for the moment to point perpendicular to the axis .",
    "by contrast , electrical dipoles have a large dipole - dipole interaction which is intrinsically anisotropic and strongly prefers state * a*.",
    "in the two - dipole problem of the previous section , the eigenstates all had the property that each molecule s moment @xmath17 ( where @xmath62 ) had the same magnitude @xmath63 .",
    "this brings a nice benefit : these patterns tell us also about the energetics of the problem of fixed size permanent dipoles .",
    "1.*e - i * shows geometries and corresponding dipole patterns for three molecules .",
    "the physical situations of interest are ( 1 ) polarizable molecules with no permanent moment , ( 2 ) permanent dipoles which can orient in space but not change their magnitude , and ( 3 ) permanent dipoles which are also polarizable and change their magnitude .",
    "we omit category ( 3 ) for now .",
    "category ( 1 ) is mathematically simplest because linear algebra determines what happens in an external field , and whether spontaneous polarity appears .",
    "1.*e , f , h * show the eigenvectors of largest eigenvalue of @xmath1 for ( * e * ) the equilateral triangle , ( * f * ) the linear arrangement , and ( * h * ) an obtuse isosceles triangle . for the equilateral case ,",
    "the eigenvector is determined by symmetry , but for the other two cases , there are two independent vectors odd under the perpendicular mirror , so a @xmath64 matrix is needed , and the central atom ( or molecule ) has a larger @xmath65 than the end atoms .",
    "because @xmath63 is no longer the same for each molecule in the maximal eigenvector , it is not the solution of the problem of a fixed moment . instead , for fixed moments we want to know the pattern @xmath22 which minimizes @xmath66 subject to @xmath15 nonlinear constraints @xmath67 .",
    "this is a much harder mathematical problem .",
    "fortunately , the solution is guaranteed @xcite to have a smooth relation to the maximal eigenvector of @xmath1 . the solutions to the fixed moment problem in zero field are shown in fig .",
    "1.*g , i * , and are close to the unconstrained solutions in fig .",
    "[ 0.3 ] in all directions . in the right , the field decays exponentially in the directions transverse to the stack.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .2 in    consider the arrangement @xmath22 of fig .",
    "2 , with equally spaced dipoles @xmath13 of equal magnitude , all pointing in the @xmath41 direction which is also the direction of the stack of molecules .",
    "it is clear that this pattern is the maximal eigenvector of the corresponding @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenvalue is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the spacing of dipoles and @xmath70 is the riemann zeta function . since the moments are equal , this pattern is also the solution to the problem of fixed dipoles on a 1-d line .",
    "it is interesting to compute the electric field of this stack , which is the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the radial distance ) . by methods described elsewhere",
    "@xcite the potential has the asymptotic form @xmath73 this result explains why fixed dipoles particularly like to form one - dimensional stacks .",
    "the dipole - dipole attraction within the stack is very big , and the interaction with other dipoles falls very rapidly with distance .",
    "the asymptotic form eq.[eq : phi ] is already accurate to 2% at @xmath74 .",
    "[ 0.4 ]    .2 in    an eigenvector of this problem was found independently by clausius @xcite and mossotti @xcite , and is illustrated in fig .",
    "if all dipoles point along a cube axis , with equal magnitude , it is clear that the induced field does the same thing , so this is an eigenvector .",
    "the clausius - mossotti arguments show that the eigenvalue is @xmath75 where @xmath76 , the density of molecules , is @xmath77 for the simple cubic lattice . a good pedagogical discussion is given by aspnes @xcite .",
    "one should also ask whether this is the maximal eigenvalue . from fig .",
    "2 , it is clear that for the simple cubic lattice illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , the answer is `` no . '' one can further lower the energy by reversing the direction of alternate stacks of dipoles , producing a slightly larger eigenvalue in an antiferroelectric pattern .",
    "luttinger and tisza @xcite proved that this pattern had the extremal eigenvalue . for diamond structure ,",
    "a more complicated extremal antiferroelectric eigenstate was found by white _",
    "these authors also showed that for _ fcc _ and _ bcc _ structures , the clausius - mossotti ferroelectric eigenstate is maximal .",
    "[ 0.35 ] periodic tilts around the ( 111 ) axis of bx@xmath0 ( reo@xmath0 structure type ) perovskites .",
    "the solid line is the total electrostatic energy ( units @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the anion charge ) computed for rigid ions comprising rigid octahedra , with a corresponding hard - core contraction perpendicular to ( 111 ) planes .",
    "the dashed curves , from top to bottom , are electrostatic energy for one displaced anion , dipole - dipole attraction energy of interacting displacements , and volume contraction energy .",
    "the sum of these is the dashed curve , coinciding with the exact energy up to fourth order terms in the taylor series.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .2 in    in this last section a brief discussion is given of recent work to be explained more fully elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have found that dipole - dipole interactions play an unexpectedly big role in the `` octahedral tilt '' instabilities common in perovskite materials @xcite .",
    "the motif is evident in fig .",
    "1.*e * , showing the tendency of a triangular plaquette to polarize circumferentially . in the perovskite tilt , when the axis is ( 111 ) , the displaced anions create the same triangular pattern of displacive dipoles .",
    "the moment points from the new anion position to the undistorted cubic anion position .",
    "these moments interact because they create an induced field at each undisplaced site . after some thought one can conclude that this is an eigenstate of @xmath1 , and after some calculation one can prove that it is the maximal eigenstate .",
    "there is no better way to place dipoles on the x sites of abx@xmath0 perovskite than in the pattern corresponding to this tilt .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath80 , is 15% bigger than @xmath81 .",
    "the consequence is that in a rigid ion picture , the bx@xmath0 simplification of the abx@xmath0 lattice is only marginally stable under electrostatic and hard sphere forces . when the anion polarizability is added to the theory @xcite ,",
    "the structure is almost immediately unstable even for very small polarizability .",
    "the maximum eigenvalue is accidentally 5-fold degenerate .",
    "three of the partners permit @xmath82 alternating tilts in any linear combination around any cube axis .",
    "these generate the distortions labeled @xmath83 in glazer notation @xcite .",
    "the glazer distortions with + signs require tilts with @xmath84 periodicity , which happen also to be eigenvectors of @xmath1 , with slightly smaller than maximal eigenvalue .",
    "it seems appropriate , given the role that dipolar interactions play , to regard all these distorted ground states as multiple - sublattice antiferroelectrics .",
    "the other two partners are related to the cooperative jahn - teller ground state of lamno@xmath0 , which thus also has an unexpected contribution from polar interactions in its distorted ground state .",
    "maximal eigenstates of the dipole - dipole interaction tensor @xmath1 are useful and relevant to several problems : response of polarizable clusters to external fields , causes and patterns of spontaneous distortion of polar assemblies , and the self - organization of polar molecules in various media .",
    "it is surprising how robust and useful this concept seems to be . given that short range repulsive forces are large , and that near - neighbor electrostatics may involve higher multipoles , there is no obvious reason why a pattern like the perovskite octahedral tilt should have to conform to the maximal eigenvector .",
    "the fact that it does should encourage us to use this tool in other problems .",
