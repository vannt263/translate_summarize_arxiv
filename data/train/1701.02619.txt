    "the interaction between the predator and prey is closely related with the functional response of the predator , which refers to the per capita feeding rate of the predator upon its prey @xcite . in general",

    "the predator density - independent functional responses are generally classified into four holling types : type i - iv@xcite .",
    "when @xmath12 is holling type i functional response , that is , @xmath14 seo and kot @xcite found that the kinetic system of model possesses two limit cycles and these cycles arise through global cyclic - fold bifurcations .",
    "when @xmath12 is the following holling type ii functional response @xmath15 the ode system of model has been investigated extensively on the aspect of the global stability and existence and uniqueness of a limit cycle @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite on the bifurcations of steady states and periodic solutions and the existence and nonexistence of nonconstant steady states for pde system with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions . for pde system",
    "subject to homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions , zhou and mu @xcite gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of positive steady states of system .",
    "moreover , other predator - prey models with holling type ii functional response were studied in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath12 is holling type iii or iv functional response , the dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns of system were investigated in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the above mentioned holling type functional responses can induce different dynamical behaviors and spatiotemporal patterns , which can be used to explain the ecological complexity . however , these functional responses are all independent of the predator density , which implies that the competition among predators for food occurs only in the process of prey depletion @xcite .",
    "this is not realistic sometimes and the predator interference was investigated by many researchers .",
    "for example , when @xmath12 is holling type i functional response with predator interference , that is , @xmath16 seo and deangelis @xcite studied the stability and bifurcations of equilibria for the kinetic system of model . here",
    "@xmath17 models the mutual interference among predators , and if @xmath18 , eq . is reduced to holling type i functional response .",
    "similarly , the following functional response can be derived from holling type ii functional response : @xmath19 this functional response is always referred to as the beddington - deangelis ( bd ) functional response , which was introduced by beddington @xcite and deangelis et al . @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of model with bd functional response was investigated in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the following functional response , proposed by bazykin @xcite and crowley and martin @xcite , @xmath20 also models the predator interference , which is referred to as the crowley - martin ( cm ) functional response . for this functional response , sambath et al .",
    "@xcite studied the stability and bifurcations of the positive equilibrium of system when the positive equilibrium is unique .",
    "wang and wu @xcite studied a slightly different model , where the growth rate of the predator is logistic type in the absence of prey , and obtained the stability and multiplicity of the positive solutions when some parameters are large or small .",
    "we remark that there are also many results on other predator - prey models with cm functional response @xcite .    in this paper",

    "system can be simplified as follows : @xmath33 here parameter @xmath11 represents the conversion rate of the predator , all the parameters are positive , and @xmath22 is a bounded domain in @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) with a smooth boundary @xmath25 .",
    "the results in @xcite are mainly derived under certain conditions where system has a unique constant positive equilibrium . however , there are two or three constant positive equilibria of system under certain conditions .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to understand the stationary solutions even when system has more than one constant positive equilibrium .",
