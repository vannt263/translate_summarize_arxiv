    "ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have created a dense matter consisting of partonic degrees of freedom , often called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . from comparisons between the experimental data on various observables and results of different theoretical models ,",
    "we expect to learn the space - time evolution of the dense matter and consequently the properties of qgp and quantum chromodynamics . for collisions of heavy ions such as pb+pb ,",
    "the highest energy achievable in the near future is @xmath5 tev .",
    "since high energy heavy ion collisions are expected to create a qgp matter with a high initial effective temperature with a long lifetime being in parton degrees of freedom , comparing observables at this highest energy with those at lower energies will provide us new information for the study of qgp properties .",
    "simulations of the space - time evolution of relativistic heavy ion collisions have been performed extensively with hydrodynamic models @xcite , transport models @xcite , and hybrid models that combine a hydrodynamic model with a transport model @xcite . despite the different physics foundations and assumptions in these three types of models ,",
    "they have been quite successful in describing many observables such as azimuthal anisotropies .",
    "it has been widely believed that for heavy colliding systems transport models essentially approach the hydrodynamical limit , therefore it does not seem surprising that transport and hydrodynamic models can both describe anisotropy observables in large systems .",
    "on the other hand , it is puzzling that they also both seem to describe azimuthal anisotropies in small systems such as p+pb and d+au collisions @xcite , since transport models are far from the hydrodynamical limit for small systems .",
    "recently it was realized that transport models for current ultra - relativistic heavy colliding systems may still be far from the hydrodynamical limit . in particular , it is found with transport models @xcite that azimuthal anisotropies may be produced mainly by the anisotropic parton escape probability as a response to the initial spatial eccentricity through interactions , not mainly by the hydrodynamic - type collective flow .",
    "therefore transport models and hydrodynamic models for current heavy ion collisions are different , and it is important to identify unique signatures of transport or hydrodynamic models in order to determine which picture is a more relevant description for a given type of heavy ion collisions .",
    "there have been recent hydrodynamic predictions for 5.02 tev pb+pb collisions @xcite , and in this study we present transport predictions from a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model @xcite .",
    "the ampt model was constructed to simulate relativistic heavy ion collisions , and predictions were made for au+au collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "the model at that time ( now called the default version ) consisted of fluctuating initial conditions from the hijing model @xcite , the elastic parton cascade zpc @xcite for minijet partons , the lund string model @xcite for hadronization , and the art hadron cascade @xcite . with modified lund string fragmentation @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters @xcite ,",
    "the default ampt model was able to reasonably describe the rapidity distributions and @xmath8 spectra in heavy ion collisions from cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) to rhic energies .",
    "it was later found that the default version of the ampt model ( as all transport models at the time ) under - estimated the elliptic flow observed at rhic , and the reason was that most of the energy produced in the overlap volume of heavy ion collisions are in hadronic strings and thus not included in the parton cascade in the model @xcite .",
    "so the string melting version of the ampt model was constructed , where all excited hadronic strings in the overlap volume are converted into partons @xcite .",
    "the string melting ampt model consists of fluctuating initial conditions from the hijing model @xcite , the elastic parton cascade zpc @xcite for all partons from the melting of hadronic strings , a quark coalescence model for hadronization , and the art hadron cascade @xcite . due to its dense parton phase",
    ", the string melting version reasonably fit the elliptic flow @xcite and two - pion interferometry @xcite in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies ; but it could not reproduce well the rapidity distributions and @xmath8 spectra ( when using the same lund @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters as in the default version ) . therefore ,",
    "in previous predictions from the ampt model on pb+pb collisions at 5.5 tev @xcite , we used the default ampt model to predict particle yields and @xmath8 spectra but used the string melting ampt model to predict the elliptic flow and two - pion or two - kaon correlation functions .",
    "recently we found that the string melting ampt model can be tuned to reasonably reproduce the pion and kaon yields , @xmath8 spectra , and elliptic flows below @xmath9 gev/@xmath10 in central and semi - central au+au collisions at the rhic energy of @xmath11 gev and pb+pb collisions at the lhc energy of 2.76 tev @xcite . for predictions for the top lhc energy of 5.02 tev in this study",
    ", we use the same string melting ampt version ( v2.26t5 , available online @xcite ) and the same parameter values as used for the lhc energy of 2.76 tev in an earlier study @xcite .",
    "these parameters include the lund string fragmentation parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath14 , strong coupling constant @xmath15 , and a parton cross section of 3 mb .",
    "note that this ampt version @xcite imposes an upper limit of 0.40 on the relative production of strange to nonstrange quarks from the lund string fragmentation .",
    "in addition , in order to avoid potential effects due to different lund @xmath6-values , we also use these parameters ( lund @xmath12 in particular ) for the 200 gev rhic simulations in this study , even though they describe the 200 gev dn / dy data not as well as the earlier study @xcite which used lund @xmath16 .",
    "since our predictions include observables far away from mid-(pseudo)rapidity , we terminate the hadron cascade at 200 fm/@xmath10 in all ampt calculations of this study instead of the typical value of 30 fm/@xmath10 .",
    "note that centrality in ampt results of this study is determined by the range of impact parameters in the simulated minimum - bias events for which we impose no upper limit on the maximum impact parameter .",
    "for example , for pb+pb collisions at 5.02 tev the 0 - 5% centrality corresponds to impact parameters from 0 to 3.6 fm while the 20 - 30% centrality corresponds to impact parameters from 7.3 fm to 8.9 fm .",
    "at mid - pseudorapidity ( @xmath18 ) from the string melting ampt model in comparison with data for heavy ion collisions at @xmath5 tev , 2.76 tev and 200 gev.,width=6 ]    we compare in fig.[fig : dnchde ] charged particle yields at mid - pseudorapidity , scaled by half the number of participant nucleons @xmath19 , from the string melting ampt model ( curves without symbols ) in comparison with the experimental data , which include the alice pb+pb data at @xmath5 tev @xcite , 2.76 tev @xcite , and the phenix au+au data at 200 gev @xcite .",
    "although these ampt results were already obtained with the same ampt code and parameters as in an earlier study @xcite before the announcement of the alice 5.02 tev data @xcite , they were not posted before the data and are thus , strictly speaking , not predictions .     at two different energies from ampt in comparison with the corresponding ratio derived from experimental data.,width=6 ]    figure  [ fig : dnchde ]",
    "shows that the ampt model reproduces the overall magnitudes and the @xmath19 dependence shapes of @xmath17 at mid - pseudorapidity ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "note that the ampt 200 gev results in this study are obtained using the same lund @xmath6 parameter ( @xmath12 ) as the lhc results ; they are generally lower than the phenix data and also lower than the ampt 200 gev results in an earlier study @xcite where the lund parameter @xmath16 was used .",
    "we also see in fig.[fig : dnchde ] that the energy dependence of @xmath17 at mid - pseudorapidity from ampt is often stronger than the data . this can be better demonstrated in fig.[fig : dnchderatio ] , where we show the ratio of mid - pseudorapidity @xmath17 at one energy to that at a lower energy .",

    "the ratio of mid - pseudorapidity @xmath17 in pb+pb collisions at 5.02 tev to that at 2.76 tev from ampt ( solid curve ) is close to the corresponding data , and its magnitude is much lower than the other ratio ( dashed curve ) as a result of the smaller relative increase of the collision energy . note that , since the experimental data ( and ampt results ) in fig.[fig : dnchde ] at different energies have different sets of @xmath19 values , we have used linear interpolation in order to make the @xmath17 ratio at a given @xmath19 value for fig.[fig : dnchderatio ] .    the @xmath17 results as functions of @xmath20 at different centralities of pb+pb collisions are shown in fig .",

    ", at mid - pseudorapidity in comparison with the cms data at 2.76 tev and star data at 200 gev . , width=6 ]     at mid - pseudorapidity at two different energies as a function of @xmath19 from ampt in comparison with data . , width=6 ]    since we may expect some uncertainties to cancel out in ratios , we show in fig.[fig : meanptratio ] the ratio of the charged particle @xmath83 at mid - pseudorapidity at one energy to that at a lower energy .",
    "the ratio of the ampt @xmath83 at 2.76 tev to that at 200 gev ( dashed curve ) is seen to have a weak centrality dependence similar to the data ; while the overall magnitude of the ampt ratio is lower than the data .",
    "we also see from the ampt results that , as the energy of pb+pb collisions increases from 2.76 tev to 5.02 tev , @xmath83 at mid - pseudorapidity only increases slightly ( between 1.7% and 3.0% ) .",
    "the overall magnitude of the @xmath83 relative increase from ampt is close to that from a recent hydrodynamic prediction @xcite .",
    "however the centrality dependences are different : ampt results show a small decrease of the @xmath83 ratio going from mid - central towards central collisions , while the hydrodynamic prediction @xcite shows a small increase .",
    "spectra at mid - rapidity for the 0 - 5% centrality , and c ) @xmath25 as a function of @xmath8 at mid - rapidity for the 20 - 30% centrality .",
    "corresponding experimental data at 2.76 tev and 200 gev are also shown for comparison .",
    ", width=6 ]    proton rapidity distribution is another observable that the string melting version of the ampt model fails to describe .",
    "it was realized earlier on @xcite that the string melting version of ampt ( unlike the default version of ampt ) gives an artificial peak at mid - rapidity in the proton and anti - proton rapidity distributions for central au+au collisions at 200 gev , which points to the need to improve the simple quark coalescence model in ampt @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig : proton]a , the string melting ampt model also gives mid - rapidity peaks in both central ( thick curves ) and semi - central ( thin curves ) pb+pb collisions at lhc energies .",
    "in addition , the model significantly over - estimates the proton dn / dy at mid - rapidity in comparison with the corresponding alice data at 2.76 tev ( filled circles ) . figure  [ fig :",
    "proton]b shows the proton @xmath8 spectra at mid - rapidity for central collisions , where we see that the ampt model mostly over - estimates at low @xmath8 and the over - estimation factor is bigger at 2.76 tev than that at 200 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the elliptic flow is normalized by the particle multiplicity , therefore it is not directly affected by this over - estimation .",
    "figure  [ fig : proton]c indeed shows that the proton @xmath25 results at mid - rapidity from ampt ( curves without symbols ) agree reasonably well with the alice data at 2.76 tev and phenix data at 200 gev for the 20 - 30% centrality , where the ampt @xmath25 results at 200 gev has the cut @xmath57 for comparison with the phenix data .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to address the problem in baryon rapidity distributions in the string melting version of ampt .",
    "improvements of the quark coalescence model in ampt will be needed ; for example , it has been proposed that one should use the local energy density as the criterion of hadronization in order to make the effective equation of state more realistic @xcite .",
    "using the string melting version of a multi - phase transport model with parameters established from an earlier study , we present predictions on various observables in pb+pb collisions at @xmath5 tev .",
    "ampt results and experimental data for pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev and au+au collisions at 200 gev are also often shown for comparisons .",
    "we first compare with the already - available centrality dependence data on charged particle @xmath2 in pb+pb collisions at 5.02 tev .",
    "we then present ampt model predictions on identified particle dn / dy , @xmath8-spectra at mid - rapidity for central collisions , azimuthal anisotropies @xmath3 including the @xmath8 , centrality and @xmath20 dependences , and factorization ratios @xmath4 for longitudinal correlations .",
