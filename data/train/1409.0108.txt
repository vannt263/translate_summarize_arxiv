    "the _ ab initio _ theoretical description of light nuclei is based on direct solution of the nuclear many - body problem given realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions . in no - core",
    "configuration interaction ( ncci ) calculations  @xcite , the nuclear many - body problem is formulated as a matrix eigenproblem .",
    "the hamiltonian is represented in terms of basis states which are antisymmetrized products of single - particle states for the full @xmath2-body system of nucleons , _",
    "i.e. _ , with no assumption of an inert core .",
    "in practice , the nuclear many - body calculation must be carried out in a truncated space .",
    "the dimension of the problem grows combinatorially with the size of the included single - particle space and with the number of nucleons in the system .",
    "computational restrictions therefore limit the extent to which converged results can be obtained , for energies or for other properties of the wave functions . except for the very lightest systems ( @xmath3 )",
    ", convergence is generally beyond reach .",
    "instead , we seek to approach convergence as closely as possible . based on the still - unconverged calculations which are computationally feasible",
    ", we would then ideally be able to obtain a reliable estimate of the true values of observables which would be obtained in the full , untruncated space .",
    "therefore , progress may be pursued both by seeking accelerated convergence , _",
    "e.g. _ , through the choice of basis , as considered here , and by developing means by which robust extrapolations can be made  @xcite .",
    "ncci calculations have so far been based almost exclusively upon bases constructed from harmonic oscillator single - particle wave functions .",
    "the harmonic oscillator radial functions have the significant limitation that their asymptotic behavior is gaussian , _",
    "i.e. _ , falling as @xmath4 for large @xmath5 .",
    "the actual asymptotics for nucleons bound by a finite - range force are instead expected to be exponential , _",
    "i.e. _ , falling as @xmath6 .",
    "is shown on a logarithmic scale , so that exponential asymptotics would appear as a straight line .",
    "the woods - saxon and oscillator potentials are shown in the inset .",
    "( solutions are for the woods - saxon @xmath7 function , with potential parameters appropriate to neutrons in @xmath8{o}$ ]  @xcite , with maximal basis radial quantum numbers @xmath9 as indicated . ) , scaledwidth=67.0% ]    the problem encountered in using an oscillator basis to describe a system with exponential asymptotics may be illustrated through the simple one - dimensional example of the schrdinger equation with a woods - saxon potential . in fig .",
    "[ fig - ws - soln ] , we see the results of solving for a particular eigenfunction in terms of successively larger bases of oscillator radial functions . in the classically forbidden region , where the potential is nearly flat , the tail of the wave function should be exponential .",
    "it should thus appear as a straight line on the logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "[ fig - ws - soln ] .",
    "inclusion of each additional basis function yields a small extension to the region in which the expected straight - line behavior is reproduced , but , for any finite number of oscillator functions , there is a radius beyond which the calculated tail is seen to sharply fall below the true asymptotics .",
    "observables which are sensitive to the large - radius asymptotic portions of the nuclear wave function therefore present a special challenge to convergence in ncci calculations with a conventional oscillator basis .",
    "such `` long - range '' observables include the rms radius and @xmath10 moments and transitions , since the @xmath11 dependence of the relevant operators in both cases preferentially weight the larger-@xmath5 portions of the wave - function .",
    "the results for these observables in ncci calculations are in general highly basis - dependent  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a prominent feature in light nuclei is the emergence of halo structure  @xcite , in which one or more loosely - bound nucleons surround a compact core , spending much of their time in the classically - forbidden region .",
    "a realistic treatment of the long - range properties of the wave function is essential for an accurate reproduction of the halo structure  @xcite .",
    "we are therefore motivated to consider alternative bases which might be better suited for expanding the nuclear wave function in its asymptotic region .",
    "the framework for carrying out ncci calculations with a general radial basis is developed in ref .",
    "we explore the use of the coulomb - sturmian functions  @xcite , which form a complete set of square - integrable functions and have exponential asymptotics .    in the present work ,",
    "we apply the colomb - sturmian basis to ncci calculations for the neutron halo nuclei @xmath12{he}$ ]   as well as to the baseline case @xmath13{he}$ ] , for which converged results can be obtained .",
    "we examine the possibility of extracting rms radii for the proton and neutron distributions based on a relatively straightforward estimate , the `` crossover point ''  @xcite , pending further development of more sophisticated extrapolation schemes  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the disparity between proton and neutron radial distributions in the neutron - rich halo nuclei , we also explore the use of proton - neutron asymmetric bases , with different length scales for the proton and neutron radial basis functions .",
    "the basis and methods are first reviewed ( sec .",
    "[ sec - methods ] ) , after which the results for @xmath14{he}$ ] are discussed ( sec .  [ sec - results ] ) .",
    "the harmonic oscillator basis functions , as used in conventional ncci calculations , constitute a complete , discrete , orthogonal set of square - integrable functions and are given by @xmath15 , with radial wave functions @xmath16 e^{-\\tfrac12(r / b)^2},\\ ] ] where the @xmath17 are generalized laguerre polynomials , the @xmath18 are spherical harmonics , @xmath9 is the radial quantum number , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the orbital angular momentum and its @xmath21-projection , and @xmath22 is the oscillator length .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian functions likewise constitute a complete , discrete , orthogonal set of square - integrable functions , while also possessing exponential asymptotics more appropriate to the nuclear problem .",
    "they are given by @xmath23 , with radial wave functions @xmath24 where @xmath22 again represents a length scale .",
    "further details may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . both sets of radial functions",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - scheme - radial ] , for comparison .    for either basis , the single - particle basis states @xmath25 are then defined by coupling of the orbital angular momentum with the spin , to give total angular momentum @xmath26 , and the many - body basis is defined by taking antisymmetrized products of these single - particle states .",
    "thus , the structure of the many - body calculation is independent of the details of the radial basis .",
    "the choice of radial basis only enters the calculation through the values of the hamiltonian two - body matrix elements ( or higher - body matrix elements , if present ) , which we must first generate as the input to the many - body calculation .",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian for ncci calculations has the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the galilean - invariant , two - body relative kinetic energy operator , and @xmath29 is the nucleon - nucleon interaction . of center - of - mass oscillator quanta can also be included , to shift center - of - mass excitations out of the low - lying spectrum , but it is not essential for the ground - state properties considered here .",
    "the implications of center - of - mass dynamics for general bases are addressed in ref .",
    "the relative kinetic energy decomposes into one - body and two - body terms as @xmath30.\\ ] ] since the two - body term is separable , matrix elements of @xmath28 may be calculated in a straightforward fashion for any radial basis , in terms of one - dimensional radial integrals of the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "calculation of the interaction two - body matrix elements becomes more involved if one moves to a general radial basis .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is defined in relative coordinates .",
    "the oscillator basis is special , in that matrix elements in a relative oscillator basis , consisting of functions @xmath33 , can readily be transformed to the two - body oscillator basis , consisting of functions @xmath34 , by the moshinsky transformation .",
    "we therefore still begin by carrying out the transformation to two - body matrix elements @xmath35 with respect to the oscillator basis , and only then carry out a change of basis to the coulomb - sturmian basis in the two - body space , as  @xcite @xmath36 where we label single - particle orbitals for the oscillator basis by unbarred symbols @xmath37 and those for the coulomb - sturmian basis by barred symbols @xmath38 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath39 required for the transformation are obtained from straightforward one - dimensional overlaps of the harmonic oscillator and coulomb - sturmian radial functions , @xmath40 .",
    "the oscillator length @xmath41 with respect to which the interaction two - body matrix elements are defined and the length scale @xmath22 of the final coulomb - sturmian basis functions may in general be different .",
    "the change - of - basis transformation in  ( [ eqn - tbme - xform ] ) is , in practice , limited to a finite sum , _",
    "e.g. _ , with a shell cutoff @xmath42 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath43 must be chosen high enough to insure that the results of the subsequent many - body calculation are cutoff - independent , which may in general depend upon the oscillator and coulomb - sturmian length parameters , interaction , nucleus , and observable at hand .",
    "of the harmonic oscillator basis and ( b )  @xmath44 of the coulomb - sturmian basis , with @xmath45 given by the node - matching prescription ( see text ) .",
    "these functions are shown arranged according to the harmonic oscillator principal quantum number @xmath46 , and are labeled by @xmath19 .",
    "the dotted curves show the same functions dilated outward by a factor of @xmath47 . ]",
    "any single particle basis , including  ( [ eqn - ho - r ] ) or  ( [ eqn - cs - s ] ) , has a free length scale @xmath22 . for the oscillator basis",
    ", this is traditionally quoted as the oscillator energy @xmath48 , where @xmath49^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] in deference to the convention of presenting ncci results as a function of the basis `` @xmath48 '' , we nominally carry over this relation to define an @xmath50 parameter for general radial bases , although @xmath48 no longer has any direct physical meaning as an energy scale .",
    "regardless , the inverse square - root dependence remains , so that a factor of two change in @xmath48 describes a factor of @xmath51 change in radial scale , as illustrated for both harmonic oscillator and coulomb - sturmian bases by the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig - scheme - radial ] .",
    "furthermore , there is much additional freedom in the basis , since the many - body basis states ( antisymmetrized product states ) constructed from a single - particle basis are orthonormal so long as the single - particle states are orthonormal .",
    "orthogonality for single - particle states of different @xmath19 or @xmath26 follows entirely from the angular and spin parts of the wave function",
    ". only orthogonality _ within _ the space of a given @xmath19 and @xmath26 follows from the radial functions , _",
    "e.g. _ , for the coulomb - sturmian functions , @xmath52\\,\\delta_{l'l}\\delta_{j'j}$ ] .",
    "we are therefore free to choose @xmath22 independently , firstly , for each @xmath19 space ( or @xmath26 space ) , as @xmath45 ( or @xmath53 ) , and , secondly , for protons and neutrons , as @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the first observation raises the possibility , still to be explored , of obtaining significant improvements in the efficacy of the basis by optimizing the @xmath19-dependence of the length parameter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radial scale of the coulomb - sturmian functions , for each @xmath19 , was fixed by matching the first node of the @xmath56 coulomb - sturmian function to the first node of the @xmath56 oscillator function , at that @xmath19 , yielding the prescription @xmath57^{1/2}b({{\\hbar\\omega}})$ ]  @xcite .",
    "the second observation raises the possibility of proton - neutron asymmetric length scales , which might be advantageous for nuclei with significant disparities between the proton and neutron distributions , in particular , halo nuclei .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we adopt @xmath58 where @xmath59 sets an overall relative scale @xmath60 . for example , if the solid and dotted curves in fig .
