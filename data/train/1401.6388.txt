    "the vacuum state is defined as the state annihilated by all the particle annihilation operators .",
    "the definition of a vacuum state is therefore dependent on how the field modes are split into positive and negative frequency modes .",
    "this split is restricted for a quantum scalar field by the fact that positive frequency modes must have positive klein - gordon norm . for a quantum fermion field ,",
    "both positive and negative frequency fermion modes have positive dirac norm , so the split of the field modes into positive and negative frequency is less constrained compared with the scalar field case .",
