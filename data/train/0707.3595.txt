    "with the start of data taking at the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) , particle physics will , for the first time , directly probe the tera scale , i.e.  the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking according to the standard model  ( sm ) , around  @xmath2 . while the  sm has been confirmed experimentally to be a very precise effective description of the physics below the tera scale ,",
    "there are many serious contenders for the more fundamental theory beneath the  sm .",
    "for quite some time , superstring theory has been a leading candidate for the fundamental theory unifying all known interactions .",
    "there are certain solutions of superstring theory with additional spatial dimensions , where the characteristic string scales are low enough to allow experimental tests at the lhc and the planned international @xmath3 linear collider  ( ilc ) .",
    "one spectacular prediction  @xcite of superstring theory is the emergence of a noncommutative  ( nc ) structure of spacetime at a scale  @xmath4 associated with nonvanishing commutators @xmath5 = { \\mathrm{i}}\\theta_{\\mu\\nu }       = { \\mathrm{i}}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{nc}}^2}c_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] of spacetime coordinates that correspond to oriented minimal resolvable areas of size  @xmath6 . while a nonvanishing commutator like  ( [ eq : nc - geometry ] ) had been proposed much earlier  @xcite as a regulator of divergencies in quantum field theory  ( qft ) and quantum gravity , the observation of  @xcite caused intense renewed interest in qft on nc spacetimes ( ncqft ) .",

    "spacetime by replacing all products of functions by moyal - weyl @xmath7-products @xmath8 a prescription for constructing arbitrary gauge theories on a nc spacetime was presented in  @xcite .",
    "these so - called seiberg - witten maps  ( swm ) realize nc gauge transformations in the nc theory as ordinary commutative gauge transformations on an effective commutative gauge theory . by going to the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra of a given gauge group , this approach  @xcite circumvents obstructions like charge quantization in  @xmath9 gauge theories and the prohibition of  @xmath10 gauge groups in the earlier attempts .    in particular , this prescription allowed the construction of the so - called noncommutative standard model  ( ncsm )  @xcite as an anomaly - free  @xcite canonical nc extension of the sm without having to introduce additional particles gauge theory and subsequently break the extraneous symmetries , introducing additional particles that must be removed from the observable spectrum  @xcite . ] . in the first order of an expansion in  @xmath0",
    ", one has only three new bounded parameters that depend on the choice of the representation of the enveloping algebra of the sm lie algebra and describe new couplings among gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "these couplings vanish in the minimal ncsm , where the enveloping algebra is realized by matrices acting in the vector space of the adjoint representation .",
    "furthermore , the bosonic sector of the minimal ncsm was shown to be renormalizable at one loop  @xcite , where all counter terms can be expressed through the usual field strength and coupling constant renormalizations .",
    "also the nonminimal ncsm is renormalizable at one - loop , if a _ finite _ gauge invariant @xmath1-term is added to the action  @xcite .",
    "finally , the fermionic sector can be shown to require a finite number of gauge invariant four - fermion operators as additional counter terms in one loop order  @xcite . in euclidean nc space",
    ", the renormalizability of scalar and gauge models has been shown to all orders in  @xmath0  @xcite .    using the effective theory in the first order of the @xmath0-expansion ,",
    "several phenomenological studies were performed for past , present , and future colliders  @xcite . in a preceding paper  @xcite , we have studied the associated production of photons and @xmath11-bosons at hadron colliders ( tevatron and lhc ) showing that at the lhc one can reach a noncommutativity scale  @xmath4 slightly above  @xmath2  @xcite . moreover , we have found that it is necessary to go beyond the first order in  @xmath0 , because of significant contributions from partonic center of mass energies exceeding the noncommutativity scale that can actually be probed .    while it is possible in simple cases to derive expressions for families of swm to all orders in  @xmath0  @xcite , an explicit parameterization of the most general solution has not been given .",
    "therefore , we start in this paper by constructing the most general swm for the ncsm in the second order of the @xmath0-expansion . the importance of this systematic approach is stressed _ a posteriori _ by discovering ambiguities in the swm that have been missed in earlier  @xmath12 constructions of swm  @xcite . while these authors expected all ambiguities to cancel in observable quantities",

    "not_. in fact , using @xmath13 as an example , we will calculate the ambiguity in the corresponding scattering amplitude explicitly .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : swm ]",
    "we derive the general swm up to second order in the noncommutativity @xmath0 .",
    "particular emphasis will be given to the ambiguities resulting from the homogeneous solutions of the gauge equivalence equations .",
    "furthermore , the lagrangian and the feynman rules of the neutral current sector of the ncsm are constructed in section  [ sec : feynman ] .",
    "section  [ sec : ambiguities ] presents our analysis of the impact of the swm ambiguities on physical observables .",
    "we will demonstrate by an explicit calculation of  @xmath14 that not all ambiguities cancel in the  @xmath12 contribution to the cross section . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",

    "complete expressions in second order in @xmath0 that are too lengthy to be included in this paper can be found in the appendix of  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the swm is to realize noncommutative gauge transformations by representations of the enveloping algebra using nonlinear functions of ordinary , commutative fields that reside in representations of the given lie algebra .",
    "this requirement is expressed by a set of so - called gauge equivalence equations for noncommutative gauge fields  @xmath15 , gauge parameters appear in the lagrangian in the guise of faddeev - popov ghosts , if the gauge fixing is performed before application of the swm . ]  @xmath16 and matter fields  @xmath17 as functions of the commutative gauge fields  @xmath18 , gauge parameters  @xmath19 and matter fields  @xmath20 .",

    "the gauge equivalence equations  ( [ eq : swm - condition ] ) can be solved order by order in an expansion in  @xmath0 .",
    "the physical predictions of qft , in particular the on - shell @xmath26-matrix elements and scattering cross sections , do not depend on the choice of interpolating fields  @xcite .",
    "in fact , any two theories which are related by non - singular local field redefinitions    [ eq : reparametrization ] @xmath27 and the corresponding change in the lagrangian @xmath28    will predict identical scattering cross sections .",
    "this reparametrization invariance can be proven both in axiomatic qft  @xcite and in perturbation theory for effective qft  @xcite .",
    "it provides the basis for the application of the powerful and now ubiquitous methods of effective qft to elementary particle physics phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the reparametrization  ( [ eq : reparametrization ] ) corresponds to a change of integration variables in the path integral , provides a particularly intuitive proof of the invariance .    since the swm @xmath29 appear to be just a reparametrization like  ( [ eq : reparametrization ] )",
    ", one might expect that its application has no effect on the calculation of observables . for a noncommutative @xmath9 gauge theory with unit charge  @xcite",
    "it can be shown that this is indeed the case . however , in theories with multiple @xmath9 charges and @xmath10 gauge groups , the enveloping algebra is strictly larger than the lie algebra and the swm  ( [ eq : swm ] ) must therefore be singular .",
    "the ncsm is a prominent representative of such theories , whence we must expect nontrivial effects of the swm on observables , as can readily be seen from  @xcite .",
    "it was noted from early on , that the solutions of  ( [ eq : swm - condition ] ) are not unique  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the construction of nc extensions of the sm via swm is a priori not unique as well .",
    "only those ambiguities that correspond to non - singular reparametrization like  ( [ eq : reparametrization ] ) are guaranteed to cancel in observables .",
    "this leaves us with the crucial problem of genuine ambiguities in physical quantities .",
    "to first order in  @xmath0 it has been shown by explicit calculations that all ambiguities cancel in on - shell scattering amplitudes . in turn",
    ", one can use these cancellations as a powerful consistency check for numerical calculations of cross sections  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no general theorem or physical argument that implies the cancellation of all ambiguities in the swm to all orders in the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "below we will identify ambiguities in the second order swm that affect cross sections . in an examination of the effective action of @xmath1-ncqed  @xcite showing that the swm in first order corresponds to a field redefinition",
    ", it was already conjectured that this is not the case in second order .",
    "our results provide a proof for this conjecture from a completely different angle .",
    "furthermore , some of the ambiguities in second order are discussed in  @xcite , but no claim is made of completeness .",
    "in fact , we have found additional ambiguities .",
    "a recursive solution of the gauge equivalence equations  ( [ eq : swm - condition ] ) to all orders in  @xmath0 , including ambiguities , has been given in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the ambiguities are not given as an explicit function of an independent set of parameters and it is not straightforward to search for observable effects in the ncsm in this form .",
    "thus we do not rely on  @xcite for a discussion of the general solution of  ( [ eq : swm - condition ] ) and derive the higher order terms anew .",
    "still , the existence of ambiguities with observable effects does not render the ncsm proposed in  @xcite unphysical and thus rather useless .",
    "it merely adds more free parameters , not unlike those originating from the freedom of choosing the representation of the enveloping algebra , already discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the most serious aspect of such additional parameters is the question to which extent deviations from sm predictions could be hidden by particular choices of the ambiguous contributions , making the ncsm untestable by experiment .",
    "the non - linear gauge equivalence equations  ( [ eq : swm - condition ] ) are most easily solved by going over to the equivalent set of equations for infinitesimal gauge transformations . in the commutative case ,",
    "the latter are given by    [ eq : delta ] @xmath30 \\\\ \\label{eq : delta - psi }    \\delta_\\alpha \\psi & = { \\mathrm{i}}\\alpha\\psi\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while the noncommutative infinitesimal gauge transformations read    [ eq : hat - delta ] @xmath31 \\\\ \\label{eq : hat - delta - psi }    \\hat\\delta_\\alpha \\hat\\psi(\\psi , a,\\theta )       & = { \\mathrm{i}}\\hat\\lambda(\\alpha , a,\\theta)\\ast\\hat\\psi(\\psi , a,\\theta)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from  ( [ eq : delta ] ) and  ( [ eq : hat - delta ] ) , one readily obtains the infinitesimal versions of the gauge equivalence equations  ( [ eq : swm - condition - a ] ) and  ( [ eq : swm - condition - psi ] ) :    [ eq : swm - condition - infinitesimal ] @xmath32    where the commutative gauge transformation  @xmath33 acts on the arguments of the noncommutative gauge and matter fields via the chain rule .    however , the equations  ( [ eq : swm - condition - infinitesimal ] ) are not sufficient .",
    "the existence of a noncommutative gauge parameter  @xmath16 in  ( [ eq : swm - condition ] ) requires that the commutator of two infinitesimal gauge transformations closes to another gauge transformation just as in the commutative case : @xmath34 } \\hat\\psi\\,,\\ ] ] where  @xmath35 $ ] denotes the bracket in the commutative lie algebra . applying  ( [ eq : swm - condition - infinitesimal - psi ] ) twice and taking into account that the commutative gauge transformation of the noncommutative gauge parameter  @xmath16 does not vanish because it depends on  @xmath18 , one has @xmath36 where all unnecessary arguments have been omitted .",
