    "in [ 1 ] , `` problems in low - dimensional topology '' by rob kirby , one can find the following :    * problem 5.17 ( freedman ) * _ given a finite set of points @xmath0 in @xmath1 , let @xmath2 be a tree in @xmath3 of minimal length with @xmath4 .",
    "is @xmath2 unknotted , that is , is there a @xmath5 imbedded 2-ball in @xmath3 containing @xmath2 ? _    it is shown here that there is a finite set @xmath0 on the boundary unit 3-ball in @xmath6 whose minimal tree _",
    "is _ knotted .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath0 is quite large , but the construction essentially depends on seven elements only : 6 points and an arc on the boundary of the ball .",
    "an outline of the example , provided by the author of this paper , is contained in [ 1 ] following the statement of problem 5.17 .",
    "the arc lies close to the equator circumventing it one and a half times . in a plane perpendicular to the equator , consider a regular hexagon whose one pair of antipodal vertices is very close to the endpoints of the arc .",
    "the set @xmath0 contains one of the other pairs of antipodal vertices .",
    "the remaining two vertices of the hexagon are split into two points each so that the points are closer to the equator and the minimal tree connects these points to the endpoints of the arc .",
    "finally , the arc is replaced by a sequence of points of small mesh .",
    "let @xmath7 be a locally connected compact set in @xmath6 with finitely many components .",
    "a _ connecting graph _ for @xmath7 is a pair @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a finite collection of straight line segments ( edges ) and @xmath10 is a set of points ( vertices ) consisting of endpoints of edges of @xmath9 , such that the set @xmath11 is connected .",
    "we informally say that the graph consists of these edges .",
    "the _ length _ of a connecting graph is the sum of the lengths of its edges .",
    "a _ minimal graph _ for @xmath7 is a connecting graph for @xmath7 whose length is a minimum . a minimal graph for @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath12 , possibly with a subscript if more than one of such graphs is considered .",
    "the length of @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "no additional notation is used for the union of the elements of @xmath12  it is also denoted by @xmath12 . for simplicity , assume that every point of @xmath14 is a vertex of @xmath12 but otherwise @xmath12 has the minimum number of vertices , i.e. , if two edges meeting at a vertex are collinear , then the vertex belongs to @xmath7 .",
    "the _ order _ of a vertex is the number of edges meeting at this vertex .",
    "if @xmath7 is finite , then a minimal graph @xmath12 is a tree , i.e. , it is connected and acyclic .",
    "it is then called a _ minimal tree _ for @xmath7 and it is denoted by @xmath15 .",

    "if all angles of @xmath20 are less than @xmath19 , then the minimal tree is a simple triod whose edges form @xmath19 angles . in general ,",
    "a minimal tree is not unique .",
    "for example , the set of vertices of a square has two minimal trees .",
    "if four or more half - lines in @xmath6 have a common endpoint @xmath21 , then at least one of the angles between the half - lines is less than @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two distinct points equidistant to @xmath21 that are on two half - lines meeting at @xmath21 at an angle less than @xmath19 , then the minimal tree @xmath24 is a triod .",
    "therefore , a vertex of a minimal graph @xmath12 is either of order 3 or it belongs to @xmath7 .",
    "the angles between the edges meeting at a vertex not in @xmath7 equal @xmath19 and the edges are coplanar .    the segment joining the points @xmath21 and @xmath25 is denoted by @xmath26 $ ] .",

    "we say that two sets @xmath7 and @xmath31 with the same finite number of components , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , are hausdorff @xmath35-close , if there is a permutation @xmath36 such that for @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
