    "+   + since @xmath15 , landau s asymptotic is in agreement with the above , but owing to the erratic behaviour of @xmath16 for @xmath17 , this definition of @xmath5 becomes impractical in the study of @xmath5 for @xmath18 .",
    "+   + what follows then , is a study of the behaviour of @xmath5 when @xmath3 is allowed to tend to infinity with @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig:01 ]     [ fig:02 ]      figure 1 shows the well - known poisson distribution of @xmath5 at @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where the solid line is the actual value , and the dotted line is landau s estimate , which appears to be fairly accurate .",
    "figure 2 however , shows @xmath21 , and whereas landau s estimate tends to zero , the actual value can be seen to approach a maximum as @xmath22 , and remain at that value .      where @xmath23 is the @xmath24th prime , the following holds for @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "+   + for @xmath27 , it is clear that @xmath28 . in fact , for any @xmath3 , it can be said that @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , but since @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , since @xmath34 .",
    "+   + for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , since @xmath37 can be deconstructed thus : +   + @xmath38 @xmath39 similarly , for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , since @xmath37 may be represented as follows:@xmath39 @xmath42 +   + the representative sequence for @xmath43 begins + @xmath44 at @xmath45 for @xmath46 respectively , +   + ( i.e. for @xmath47 , and for @xmath48 , etc . ) .",
    "+   + it may therefore be said that the prime factors ( counted with multiplicity ) are distributed cumulatively at @xmath21 .",
    "the same is also true of course for @xmath49 , and more accurate approximations of the asymptotics of k - almost primes may be derived as a result . +   +",
    "this may be more clearly seen by arranging the set of natural numbers @xmath50 into columns , where each column @xmath3 is the set of all products of exactly k not - necessarily - distinct primes ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows that any given prime , when multiplied by a power of @xmath51 , aside from the obvious of moving into the next column , eventually plateaus .",
    "figure 4 shows the defining boundary for the plateau ; namely when power of @xmath52 is introduced into a column @xmath3 . +   + figures 5 and 6 are graphic representations of figures 3 and 4 , with @xmath53 running up the @xmath54-axis , and @xmath3 running along the @xmath4-axis , where the dotted lines in figure 5 show the pattern of the doubling primes , and figure 6 shows the approximate asymptotics .",
    "an approximate estimate for the growth of the power-3 bounding curve for low @xmath3 is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the alladi - grinstead constant as shown by the solid black line in figure 6 .",
    "the asymptotes of @xmath57 ( dotted lines ) are simply translations of @xmath58 .",
    "it may be of interest to note here that the primes in column @xmath27 do not lie on these lines .",

    "a sensible starting point to finding the asymptotics of @xmath5 would be to first find the limit for @xmath21 , and then work backwards . as can be seen in figure 2 , the global maximum of landau s estimate ( at approximately @xmath59 ) approaches the actual limit , albeit prematurely .",
    "landau s formula may then be approximated ( and i suggest , improved upon ) with the following ammendments , which holds for some constant @xmath60 : @xmath61 figure 7 shows a plot of the actual values for @xmath62 for @xmath63 . the dotted line shows the limit for @xmath21 , which is reached at approximately @xmath64 .     [ fig:07 ]     [ fig:08 ]    the value for @xmath60 at this point is approximately @xmath65 , and for want of a more accurate value being found , this is the one that i shall use from here on .",
    "+   + by taking approximate numerical values for @xmath60 , that align with @xmath66 , and plotting against a cdf with equation@xmath67 where @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ; where @xmath70 is the complementary error function , @xmath71 is owen s t - function , and @xmath72 is euler s constant ; figure 8 is arrived at .",
    "all that then remains is to apply the cdf to the above formula for @xmath21 , and rearrange for @xmath5 .",
    "+   + i realise that the method described may not sit comfortably with most readers , and i would certainly prefer to furnish such an explanation with a rigorous proof , but not being a number theorist , i can offer only estimation and approximation based on testing . that mathematics may be treated as a science in this age of technology , where numerical experimentation has been possible , i can but",
    "offer an informed guess as to the values of these constants .",
    "it has seemed natural to me to employ universally recognised constants , largely because experimentation has show that purely numerical values lie extremely close to the ones given , but of course they may just as easily be replaced with numerical values until a proof justifying their use has been found .      compiling the above estimates into workable formulae",

    "improvements to the above can certainly be made , but as @xmath22 , the formulae above , as far as has been tested , seem to be fairly accurate .",
