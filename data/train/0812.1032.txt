    "a hilbert geometry is a particularly simple metric space on the interior of a compact convex set @xmath0 modeled on the construction of the klein model of hyperbolic geometry inside an euclidean ball .",
    "this metric happens to be a complete finsler metric whose set of geodesics contains the straight lines .",
    "since the definition of the hilbert geometry only uses cross - ratios , the hilbert metric is a projective invariant .",
    "in addition to ellipsoids , a second familly of convex sets play a distinct role among hilbert geometries : the simplicies . if the ellipsoids geometry is isometric to the hyperbolic geometry and are the only riemannian hilbert geometries ( see d.c .",

    "* corollary 1 ) ) , at the opposite side simplecies happen to be the only ones whose geometry is isometric to a normed vector space ( e.g. see de la harpe @xcite for the existence and foertsch & karlsson @xcite for the unicity ) .    a lot of the recent works done in the context of the these geometries focuse on finding out how close they are to the hyperbolic geometry , from different viewpoints ( see , e.g. , a.  karlsson & g.  noskov  @xcite , y.  benoist  @xcite for @xmath1-hyperbolicity , e.  socie - methou  @xcite for automorphisms and b.  colbois & c.  vernicos  @xcite for the spectrum ) .",
    "it is now quite well understood that this is closely related to regularity properties of the boundary of the convex set .",
    "for instance if the boundary is @xmath2 with positive gaussian curvature , then b.  colbois & p.  verovic  @xcite have shown that the hilbert geometry is bi - lipschitz equivalent to the hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the present work investigate those hilbert geometries close to a norm vector space .",
    "along that path it has been noticed than any polytopal hilbert geometry can be isometrically embeded in a normed vector space of dimension twice the number of it faces ( see b.c .",
    "lins  @xcite ) .",
    "then b.  coblois & p.  verovic @xcite showed that in fact no other hilbert geometry could be quasi - isometrically embedded into a normed vector space . furthermore with b.",
    "colbois and p.  verovic @xcite we have shown that the hilbert geometries of plane polygons are bi - lipshitz to the euclidean plane . even though we saw no reason for this result not to hold in higher dimension , our point of view made it difficult to obtain a generalisation due to the computations it involved .",
    "the present works aims at filling that gap by giving a slightly different proofs which holds in all dimension , with less computations , but at the cost of a longer study of simplicies .",
    "hence our main results is the following ,    [ main ] let @xmath3 be a convex polytope , its hilbert geometry @xmath4 is bi - lipshitz to the @xmath5-dimensional euclidean geometry @xmath6 .",
    "in other words there exist a map @xmath7 and a constant @xmath8 such that for any two points @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 , @xmath12    the main idea is that a polytopal convex set can be decomposed into pyramids with apex its barycenter and base its faces , and then to prove that each pyramid is bi - lipschitz to the cone it defines . however due to the multitude of available faces in dimension higher than two ,",
    "a reduction is needed and consists in using the barycentric subdivison to decompose each of these pyramids into similar simplicies , and to prove that each of these simplicies is bi - lipshitz to the cone it defines .",
    "the following corollary ``  la '' bourbaki sums up the known characterisations of the polytopal hilbert geometries    [ cor ] let @xmath13 be a properly open convex set and @xmath14 its hilbert geometry",

    "theorem [ main ] was found and proven with a completely different approach by andreas bernig @xcite .",
    "let us recall that a hilbert geometry @xmath14 is a non empty bounded open convex set @xmath0 on @xmath15 ( that we shall call _ convex domain _ ) with the hilbert distance @xmath16 defined as follows : for any distinct points @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath0 , the line passing through @xmath17 and @xmath18 meets the boundary @xmath19 of @xmath0 at two points @xmath20 and @xmath21 , such that one walking on the line goes consecutively by @xmath20 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath21 ( figure  [ dintro ] )",

    "note that the invariance of the cross - ratio by a projective map implies the invariance of @xmath28 by such a map .",
    "these geometries are naturally endowed with a @xmath29 finsler metric @xmath30 as follows : if @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 , the straight line passing by @xmath17 and directed by @xmath34 meets @xmath35 at two points @xmath36 and @xmath37  ; we then define @xmath38    ]    the hilbert distance @xmath16 is the length distance associated to @xmath39 .",
    "the idea of the proof is the following one .    1 .   we decompose each polytopal domain into a finite number of linearly equivalent cells . 2 .",
    "then each cell is shown to admit a bi - lipshits embedding onto a special cell of the hilbert geometry of the @xmath5-simplex which is known to be isometric to a @xmath5-dimensional normed vector space @xmath40 .",
    "this cell of the @xmath5-simplex is shown to be a positive cone of the @xmath40 .",
    "this cone is sent to the cone corresponding to a cell of the polytopal domain .",
    "finally this allows us to define a map from the polytopal domain to @xmath15 by patching the bi - lipshitz embeddings done cell by cell .",
    "the real difficult step is the second one .",
    "recall that to a closed convex @xmath41 set we can associate an equivalent relation , stating that two points @xmath42,@xmath43 are equivalent if there exists a segment @xmath44\\subset k$ ] containing the segment @xmath45 $ ] such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
