    "the proper motion in @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "this differs from the old convention by the @xmath16 term which properly accounts for the deformation of the azimuthal coordinate ( r.a ) towards the poles . the radial motion is entirely contained in @xmath17 and contributes as a second order effect .",
    "the so - called _ perspective acceleration _ is the product of the proper motion and the true radial velocity ( i.e. @xmath18 in @xmath17 ) and grows quadratically with time in the direction of the proper motion .",
    "the true radial velocity of the star is obtained if the perspective acceleration can be observed .",
    "compared to the observed spectroscopic shift , the difference can be attributed to several physical processes , such as the gravitational redshift and the convective outflow .",
    "however , the gravitational redshift in white dwarfs ( @xmath19 km / s ) is the dominant source of non - kinematic shifts . the astrometric signal of the offset induced by the _",

    "the gravitational redshift has also already been measured in binary systems such as sirius b. gaia+sim offers the opportunity of applying the method to a statistically significant number of nearby white dwarfs .",
    "white dwarfs can be used as absolute stellar candles to obtain distance measures and absolute photometry to old stellar complexes such as globular clusters and nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "long term astrometric observations will be extremely sensitive to planets around white dwarfs .",
    "most planetary companions to white dwarfs are expected to lie in regions exterior to a primordial separation of @xmath21-@xmath22 au @xcite , which due to central star mass loss on the red giant branch corresponds to final separations of between @xmath23@xmath24 au or larger .",
    "the presence of a long period planet ( p@xmath2515 years ) should be obvious when combining gaia+sim data sets , but its signature will be strongly correlated with the perspective acceleration effect . the combined signal of a planet with a relatively short period compared to the time - span of the observations is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . in the short period case",
    "the decoupling of the perspective acceleration with the planet signal is feasible .",
    "as.,width=403 ]    in the case of a long period planet , only the orbital motion perpendicular to the proper motion can be measurable independently .",
    "while these systems are interesting from the point of view of planetary systems evolution , they are not useful for gravitational redshift studies .",
    "we have collected a sample of white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( d@xmath220 pc ) .",
    "we compiled the sample from @xcite with proper motions obtained from simbad . in our knowledge , it represents the most complete sample of wd within @xmath26 pc .",
    "the distances determined are trigonometric parallaxes if available . except for a few binaries ( eg .",
    "sirius b ) , the masses are based on model estimates @xcite .",
    "the gravitational redshift and its astrometric signal have been simulated in gaia - alone ( 5 years ) , and gaia+sim ( 5 years + 4 sim epochs at @xmath27as ) , obtaining a realistic estimate of what can be obtained for each star .",
    "we show how the gravitational redshift term is very significant in the apparent motion of the star and can be measured by comparing the perspective acceleration effect(astrometry ) and the doppler shift ( spectroscopy ) .",
