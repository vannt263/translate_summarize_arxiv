    "the main idea of the continuum fermion approach ( cfa )  @xcite to chiral gauge theories is to discretize the gauge fields only , and to consider the fermions in the continuum . in order to do so",
    ", we need to extrapolate the lattice gauge fields to continuum gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "the generating functional for lh fermions in the sector of non - trivial topology with charge @xmath0 is defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lattice gauge field action and the continuum fermion action , respectively , with @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 s are the zero mode eigenfunctions , and @xmath6 is the green function orthogonal to the eigenfunctions subspace .",
    "whenever we write @xmath7 we mean the lattice gauge field extrapolated to the continuum .",
    "the @xmath8 s live on a lattice with lattice spacing @xmath9 . in practice",
    "the fermions are put on a fine lattice with spacing @xmath10 , with the understanding of finally taking @xmath11 .",
    "gauge invariance breaking effects can be made arbitrarily small by making @xmath12 small enough so that they do not affect the continuum limit @xmath13 ( in accordance with  @xcite ) .",
    "the effective action @xmath14 is defined as  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the link variable on the fine lattice , with ( for one species of lh fermions ) @xmath17 @xmath18 being the wilson term . for background fields with trivial topology",
    "it has been demonstrated , both analytically and numerically , that @xmath14 exists having all desired properties . in particular , @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the effective action of the vector ( free ) theory .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 gives the right anomaly , and @xmath22 is gauge invariant in the anomaly free model .",
    "we also did not encounter any problems with large ( singular ) gauge transformations  @xcite , which cause trouble in the overlap approach  @xcite ( and presumably in slavnov s approach  @xcite as well ) .    using neuberger s operator  @xcite instead of the dirac - wilson operator",
    ", @xmath23 can be computed on the original lattice due to the absence of additive fermion mass renormalization .",
    "the formal continuum expression for the t hooft vertex in the anomaly free csm with four lh fermions of charge 1 and one rh fermion of charge 2 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and similarly for @xmath26 , and where @xmath27 the integral in the numerator is over the sector with topological charge @xmath28 , while that in the denominator is over the sector with @xmath29 .    on the @xmath30 torus the gauge field takes the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the toron field",
    ", @xmath33 represents the gauge degrees of freedom , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the proper dynamical fields of zero and non - zero topological charge , respectively .",
    "after integration over the fermion fields and change of variables , eq .",
    "( [ hv1 ] ) becomes @xmath36 where  @xcite @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ hv2 ] ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , with @xmath41 @xmath42 the t hooft vertex @xmath43 has been computed analytically in  @xcite with the help of results obtained for the schwinger model in  @xcite .    in this paper we present results obtained in a ` hybrid ' calculation .",
    "for the fermionic expressions we use the analytically known formulae , which is equivalent to taking the limit @xmath44 in the cfa . in this way we by - pass the costly calculation of the fermionic determinant on ever larger lattices .",
    "the integration over the gauge fields is done numerically .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath45-dependence factorizes out in both , the numerator and the denominator , and that the factors cancel each other if one adopts special fermionic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "we then find for the numerator @xmath46 and for the denominator @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the gauge boson mass , with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is dedekind s function .",
    "the simulations were done for @xmath53 and @xmath54 on lattices of size @xmath55 varying from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . in fig .  1 we show our results as a function of @xmath58 . also shown is the analytic result  @xcite .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our results extrapolated to @xmath59 and the analytic values .",
    "we have once more illustrated that the cfa is a powerful tool for formulating and analyzing chiral gauge theories on the lattice .",
    "in particular , we find stable results at large values of @xmath60 , which allow us to determine the continuum numbers rather accurately .",
    "a problem of the overlap approach is  @xcite that a thirring term is generated dynamically , which has to be tuned carefully so that its effective coupling vanishes .",
    "this is particularly aggravating at large @xmath60 , and so far has prevented a reliable extrapolation to the continuum . in our approach , being intrinsically gauge invariant , this problem does not exist .",
    "a totally numerical computation of the t hooft vertex is under way ."
