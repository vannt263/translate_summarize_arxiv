    "an interesting case which is second order lovelock gravity is gauss - bonnet ( gb ) theory with @xmath12 dimensions . in string theory context , when assuming that the tension of a string is large as compared to the energy scale of other variables , gb term is the first curvature correction to gravitation @xcite .",
    "exactly the same as einstein gravity , the einstein - gb ( egb ) field equation contains up to second order of metric tensor and is free of ghost .",

    "the boundary properties of tnads spacetimes has been discussed in einstein gravity @xcite . in general , the killing vector which corresponds to the coordinate that parameterizes the fibre @xmath13 can have a zero - dimensional fixed point set ( called a nut solution ) or a two - dimensional fixed point set ( referred to as a ` bolt ' solution ) .",
    "generalizations to higher dimensions and higher derivative gravity have been done @xcite .",
    "these solutions of einstein gravity play a central role in the construction of m - theory configurations .",
    "indeed , the 4-dimensional tnads solution provided the first test for the ads / cft correspondence in spacetimes that are only locally asymptotically ads @xcite , and the taub - nut metric is central to the supergravity realization of the @xmath16-brane of type iia string theory @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to suppose that the generalization of these solutions to the case of egb gravity , which is the low energy limit of supergravity , might provide us with a window into some interesting new corners of m - theory moduli space .    the ads / cft correspondence , is a famous conjecture that relates a ( @xmath17)-dimensional conformal field theory to @xmath9-dimensional gravity theory with a negative cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "in light of this conjecture , similar to quantum field theory , there are some counterterms which remove infinities in the gravity action .",

    "the great importance of this method is the computation of the finite action , which is easier than the counterterm prescription , for some spacetimes higher than seven dimensions in higher derivative gravity .",
