    "it is widely recognized that nuclear corrections in neutrino reactions play an important role because they alter sometimes the neutrino ",
    "nucleon interaction at the 10 - 30% level .",
    "there are standard questions that are frequently asked on this topic for which the answers are not yet confirmed by observations . among them",
    "i will mention three .    *",
    "how big is the absorption of hadrons and in particular of pions within a nucleus ?",
    "* how does nuclear matter affect the propagation of resonances themselves ? * when a resonance decays within a nucleus , what are the changes in the energy and angular distribution of the decay products , due to interactions within the medium ?",
    "such questions are important for the interpretation of the new experiments and the precise determination of neutrino parameters which occur in neutrino oscillations and the discovery of cp violation in the leptonic sector @xcite .",
    "this article tries to present a consistent and easy to follow summary of the calculations in the anp model @xcite and then mentions a few comparisons with data which are now possible .",
    "first i will discuss a general framework within which nuclear effects are calculated .",
    "resonances like the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are produced within nuclei with the cross sections proportional to the density of nuclear matter .",
    "they either propagate within the nuclear medium or decay producing hadrons like pions , a proton or a neutron , which propagate in the medium before they exit from the nucleus . in this article",
    "we assume that the resonances either decay immediately or are absorbed .",
    "the latter means that they interact with the medium producing excited nuclear states which subsequently vibrate decaying eventually to the ground state .",
    "the extra energy in this case is transferred to thermal or other unobserved energy .",
    "the absorption of pions will be parametrized by a phenomenological function @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the invariant mass of the pion nucleon system @xcite .    in this article",
    "we shall consider the pions produced from the decays of the resonances and the interaction of the pions with an isoscalar medium .",
    "the propagation of the pions is characterized by three eigenfunctions with characteristic eigenvalues @xmath4 : @xmath5 the eigenfunctions @xmath6 denote the pion charge multiplicities ( populations ) after successive scatterings .",
    "more precisely the pion admixtures included in the eigenfunctions are reproducing themselves after each scattering . assuming charge ",
    "symmetry for the interactions there are three independent transport functions .",
    "in addition , assuming @xmath7resonance dominance the elementary interactions are written in terms of the @xmath8 cross section .",
    "the probability of a pion origninally at point @xmath9 to propagate to point @xmath10 and interact there is governed by an exponential law @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 an effective cross section given by @xmath14 in this form , the effective cross section depends on the absorption which is assumed to be the same for the three types of pions plus an interaction cross section which includes charge  exchange terms .",
    "the transport problem is a matrix problem which is solved as an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the absorption term , being proportional to the unit matrix , brings an overall factor @xmath15 consisting of a pauli suppression factor @xmath16 at the production point times a transport function @xmath17 for the eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in eq .",
    "( 1 ) correspond to the interaction matrix , i.e.  the second matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . as we describe later on",
    ", each eigenvalue has its own transport factor @xmath19 .",
    "the absorption cross section is a phenomenological function which contains several nuclear effects ; for example excitation of the nucleus , a short propagation of the @xmath7resonance before it decays , etc .",
    "it is determined phenomenologically from data .",
    "let us denote by @xmath20 with @xmath21 the neutrino ",
    "nucleon cross section averaged over protons and neutrons at production point within the nucleus .",
    "similarly denote by @xmath22 the number of pions with charges @xmath23 emerging from the nucleus @xmath24 .",
    "the isospin symmetry of the problem gives the following relation @xmath25 = a(q^2,\\ , w ) \\,\\",
    ", m \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }   d\\sigma(\\pi^+)\\\\   d\\sigma(\\pi^0)\\\\ d\\sigma(\\pi^- ) \\end{array}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath26\\ , .\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 depend on the charge exchange and are given in ref",
    ".  @xcite . they will be defined also below .",
    "taking the sum of all pions we arrive at the relation @xmath29 when the pauli factor is weighted by @xmath30 , it gives a value between 0.96 and 0.98 and consequently @xmath31 gives practically the suppression introduced by absorption .",
    "this is seen in table [ tab1 ] where the pauli factor is given as a function of @xmath32 in gev@xmath33 .",
    "in addition , we computed the charge  exchange matrix for several values of the absorption cross section and found that it affects @xmath35 by noticeable amounts but the @xmath36 charge ",
    "exchange matrix very little (  3% ) .",
    "values for the charge ",
    "exchange matrix were reported already and we give values for several nuclei .",
    "+ @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 these matrices have been used for analyzing ratios of neutral to charged currents @xcite .",
    "we mention two examples in order to show the changes that are introduced by rescatterings on nuclei .",
    "this case considers the ratio of neutral to charged  current reactions @xmath40 which has been measured in two neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the columbia ",
    "bnl experiment had a complex target consisting 75% al and 25% c. they reported the value @xcite @xmath41 the gargamelle experiment used a bubble chamber filled with freon cf@xmath42br and reported @xcite @xmath43 the two experiments are consistent with each other .",
    "the values are , however , much smaller than the value calculated for the scattering on free protons and neutrons to be denoted by @xmath44 the agreement is restored @xcite when charge ",
    "exchange corrections are included @xmath45 this example shows the important role that nuclear corrections played in establishing the isospin content of the neutral current .",
    "the same ratio could be , hopefully , measured in k2k , superkamiokande ( sk ) and miniboone .",
    "for the long  base  line experiment k2k there is an additional bonus : the ratios should be larger in sk because as the @xmath46 s travel to kamioka they oscillate to @xmath47 s which do not contribute to the charged  current cross section in the denominator .",
    "the precise value of the ratio for the two detectors is calculable .",
    "another realistic case occurred in the gargamelle experiment where they measured the production of pions in an enriched freon target .",
    "the average energy of the neutrino beam was low , in the @xmath7resonance region .",
    "they observed the ratio @xcite : @xmath48 the cross sections for @xmath49 gev in units of @xmath50 are @xmath51 it follows from these numbers that the ratio , averaged over protons and neutrons , is @xmath52 which is far away from the value reported by gargamelle .",
    "after we include nuclear corrections for bromine , the ratio becomes @xmath53 in good agreement with the experimental number .",
    "+ further information on the pion absorption cross section could be extracted @xcite from an argonne experiment on deuterium @xcite and data from the bebc experiment @xcite on a neon target .",
    "deuterium was considered to be an isoscalar target of free protons and neutrons , and nuclear corrections were introduced for neon .",
    "unfortunately , the two experiments were at different energies . however , it was possible to re - weight the data to the _ same _ atmospheric neutrino energy spectrum @xcite allowing for a direct comparison",
    ". the parameters of the anp model were found to be in good qualitative agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "the comparisons show that the qualitative properties of the pion transport model are confirmed by experiments .",
    "the remaining question is to test the degree of its accuracy . this can and should be done in the running and upcoming experiments because the model provides a means for studying the mixing and other properties of neutrinos to a higher degree of accuracy .",
    "precise determinations of nuclear corrections are also important for the discovery of cp  violation in the leptonic sector .",
