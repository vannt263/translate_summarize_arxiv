    "maximum parsimony ( mp ) is a popular tool to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from a sequence of morphological or molecular characters . since there is currently an increasing interest in representing evolution as an intertwined network  @xcite that accounts for speciation as well as reticulation events such as lateral gene transfer or hybridization , it is not surprising that consideration is given to extending parsimony to phylogenetic networks .",
    "similar to parsimony on phylogenetic trees ( reviewed in @xcite ) , one distinguishes the small and big parsimony problem . in terms of phylogenetic networks",
    ", the small parsimony problem asks for the parsimony score of a sequence of characters on a ( given ) phylogenetic network , while the big parsimony problem asks to find a phylogenetic network for a sequence of characters that minimizes the score amongst all phylogenetic networks .",
    "it is the latter problem that evolutionary biologists usually want to solve for a given data set , and it is this problem that is the focus of this paper .",
    "recently , two different approaches for parsimony on phylogenetic networks have been proposed , referred to as _ hardwired _ and _ softwired _ parsimony .",
    "the hardwired framework , introduced by @xcite , calculates the parsimony score of a phylogenetic network by considering character - state transitions along every edge of the network .",
    "a slightly different approach was taken by @xcite , who defined the softwired parsimony score of a phylogenetic network to be the smallest ( ordinary ) parsimony score of any phylogenetic tree that is displayed by the network under consideration .",
    "although one can compute the hardwired parsimony score of a set of binary characters on a phylogenetic network in polynomial time @xcite , solving the small parsimony problem is in general np - hard under both notions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the small parsimony problem on phylogenetic trees is solvable in polynomial time by applying fitch - hartigan s  @xcite or sankoff s @xcite algorithm .    given that it is in general computationally expensive to solve the small parsimony problem on networks , effort has been put into the development of heuristics @xcite , and algorithms that are exact and have a reasonable running time despite the complexity of the underlying problem @xcite . however , in finding ever quicker and more advanced algorithms to solve the small parsimony problem , an analysis of mp networks under the hardwired or softwired notion , and their biological relevance has fallen short .",
    "the only exceptions are two practical studies @xcite that aim at the reconstruction of a particular type of a softwired mp network for which the input does not only consist of a sequence of characters , but also of a given phylogenetic tree @xmath0 ( e.g. a species tree ) and a positive integer @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , this version of softwired parsimony adds @xmath1 reticulation edges to @xmath0 such that the softwired parsimony score of the resulting phylogenetic network is minimized over all possible solutions .    in this paper , we present the first analysis of mp networks and reveal fundamental properties of such networks that are simultaneously surprising and undesirable .",
    "for example , we show that an mp network under the hardwired definition tends to have a small number of reticulations , while an mp network under the softwired definition tends to have many reticulations .",
    "even stronger , we show that , for any sequence of characters , there always exists a phylogenetic tree that is an mp network under the hardwired definition . while some of our findings have independently been stated in @xcite , we remark that the author does not give any formal proofs . in conclusion ,",
    "the properties we find question the biological meaningfulness of mp networks and emphasize a fundamental difference between the hardwired and softwired parsimony framework on phylogenetic networks .",
    "we then shift towards maximum likelihood concepts on phylogenetic networks and analyze whether or not the tuffley - steel equivalence result for phylogenetic trees also holds for networks .",
    "it is well known that under a simple substitution model , parsimony and likelihood on phylogenetic trees are equivalent @xcite . however , as we shall show , parsimony on networks is not equivalent to one of the most frequently - used likelihood concepts on networks .",
    "nevertheless , the equivalence can be recovered using functions that resemble likelihoods , but are not true likelihoods in a probability theoretical sense .",
    "we call these functions pseudo - likelihoods . in this sense",
    ", the equivalence of the different parsimony concepts to pseudo - likelihoods rather than likelihoods can be viewed as another drawback of the existing notions of parsimony .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains notation and terminology that is used throughout the paper .",
    "we then analyze properties of mp networks under the hardwired and softwired definition in section  [ sec : parsimony ] .",
    "additionally , this section also considers the computational complexity of the big parsimony problem under both definitions .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : mpml ] , we re - visit the tuffley - steel equivalence result for parsimony and likelihood , and investigate in how far it can be extended from trees to networks .",
    "we end the paper with a brief conclusion in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "lastly , it is worth noting that our results are presented as general as possible .",
    "for example , we do not bound the number of character states of any character that is considered in this paper .",
    "furthermore , the only restriction in the definition of a phylogenetic network ( see next section for details ) is that the out - degree of a reticulation is exactly one .",
    "as a reticulation and speciation event are unlikely to happen simultaneously , this restriction is biologically sensible and , in fact , only needed to establish theorem  [ t : newdef ] .",
    "a _ rooted phylogenetic tree on @xmath2 _ is a rooted tree with no degree - two vertices ( except possibly the root which has degree at least two ) and whose leaf set is @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , a rooted phylogenetic tree on @xmath2 is _ binary _ if each internal vertex , except for the root , has degree three",
    ". a natural extension of a rooted phylogenetic tree on @xmath2 that allows for vertices whose in - degree is greater than one is a _ rooted phylogenetic network @xmath3 on @xmath2 _ which is a rooted acyclic digraph that satisfies the following three properties :    * @xmath2 is the set of vertices of in - degree one and out - degree zero , * the out - degree of the root is at least two , and * every other vertex has either in - degree one and out - degree at least two , or in - degree at least two and out - degree one .",
    "similar to rooted phylogenetic trees , we call @xmath2 the _ leaf set _ of @xmath3 . furthermore , each vertex of @xmath3 whose in - degree is at least two is called a _ reticulation _ and represents a species whose genome is a mosaic of at least two distinct parental genomes , while each edge directed into a reticulation is called a _ reticulation edge_. to illustrate , a rooted phylogenetic network on @xmath4 and with one reticulation is shown on the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : prelim ] . moreover , for two vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath3 , we say that @xmath5 is a _ parent _ of @xmath6 or , equivalently , @xmath6 is a _ child _ of @xmath5 if @xmath7 is an edge in @xmath3 .",
    "lastly , note that a rooted phylogenetic tree on @xmath2 is a rooted phylogenetic network on @xmath2 with no reticulation .",
    "let @xmath3 be a rooted phylogenetic network on @xmath2 and let @xmath0 be a rooted phylogenetic tree on @xmath2 .",

    "intuitively , if @xmath0 is displayed by @xmath3 , then all ancestral information inferred by @xmath0 is also inferred by @xmath3 . the two rooted phylogenetic trees @xmath8 and @xmath9 that are displayed by the network shown on the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : prelim ] are presented on the right - hand side of the same figure .",

    "moreover , since a rooted phylogenetic network @xmath3 is a special type of acyclic digraph , the definition of the hardwired parsimony score of @xmath30 on @xmath11 naturally carries over to the hardwired parsimony score of @xmath30 on @xmath3 .    in practice",

    "now , by subsequently deleting edges and vertices , and contracting vertices , we can always obtain a rooted phylogenetic tree on @xmath2 from @xmath3 which , by observation  [ ob - hard ] , has the property that its hardwired parsimony score is strictly less than that of @xmath3 .",

    "hence , from a biological point of view , it seems to be sensible to argue that @xmath6 and all of its parental species have the same genetic makeup ; thereby indicating that the associated reticulation event is possibly redundant .    referring back to theorem  [ t : tree ] ,",
    "it is not too difficult to see that each rooted phylogenetic tree that is a hardwired mp network @xmath3 for @xmath30 is , in fact , an mp tree for @xmath30 since , otherwise , @xmath3 is not optimal .",

    "moreover , since the ( ordinary ) parsimony definition for rooted phylogenetic trees coincides with the hardwired definition when restricted to rooted phylogenetic trees , it follows that @xmath0 is an mp tree for @xmath30 .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "we end this section with a result on the computational complexity of the big parsimony problem on phylogenetic networks under the hardwired definition .",
    "similar to the big parsimony problem on phylogenetic trees @xcite , the next corollary states that it takes exponential time to compute a hardwired mp network for a sequence of characters .",

    "it is however worth noting that in order to find a hardwired mp network for a sequence of characters on @xmath2 , by theorem  [ t : tree ] , it suffices to search through all rooted phylogenetic trees on @xmath2 instead of the greatly enlarged space of all rooted phylogenetic networks on @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "while the evolution of a set of species whose past is likely to include reticulation events can often be best represented by a phylogenetic network , the evolution of a particular gene or dna segment can generally be described without reticulation events and therefore be represented by a phylogenetic tree .",

    "we end this section with a remark .",
    "recall that the likelihoods of all characters on an arbitrary phylogenetic tree sum up to one . since",
    "a phylogenetic network @xmath3 can be obtained from some phylogenetic tree @xmath0 by adding edges , it follows that the the likelihoods of all characters on @xmath3 may sum up to a value that is strictly less than one because each likelihood on @xmath0 will be multiplied with the substitution probability on each additional edge in @xmath3 .",
    "this is the reason , why we refer to @xmath202 as pseudo - likelihood .",
    "the small parsimony problem on networks has recently attracted considerable attention . in particular , several related complexity questions",
    "have been settled @xcite and exact algorithms and heuristics @xcite to tackle this problem have been proposed .",
    "in contrast , the big parsimony problem has so far only been mentioned in one article @xcite , where formal proofs were omitted . yet",
    ", the big problem is exactly what is ultimately of interest to evolutionary biologists who wish to reconstruct a rooted phylogenetic network from molecular data under a parsimony framework . in this paper , we have presented the first formal analysis of mp networks and uncovered several curious properties of such networks , including interesting parallels to functions that resemble likelihood functions . depending on whether one reconstructs an mp network under the hardwired or softwired framework ,",
    "it is potentially either overly simple ( under hardwired ) or overly complex ( under softwired ) in terms of the number of reticulations .",
    "consequently , under both notions , the biological relevance of mp networks is challenged . in particular",
    ", the results in this paper show that neither hardwired nor softwired mp can distinguish between evolutionary histories that are best represented by a phylogenetic tree and histories that are best represented by a network .",
    "it suggests that we need to reconsider the definition of parsimony on networks and to develop a new or improved framework .",
    "one such improvement , that we propose , is to consider an extension of the softwired parsimony definition that computes the parsimony score of a sequence @xmath30 of characters on a rooted phylogenetic network @xmath3 by first computing @xmath88 and then increasing this score by a certain user - defined ` penalty ' for each reticulation in @xmath3 .",
    "unless the penalty is set to zero , an mp network for @xmath30 under this new definition is unlikely to have a high number of reticulations and , similarly , unless the penalty is set to infinity , such a network for @xmath30 is unlikely to be a tree .",
    "since evolutionary biologists often have valuable information at their fingertips as to whether the expected amount of reticulation is significant or not for a certain data set , this information can be used to compute parsimonious networks that are biologically more meaningful than those reconstructed under the hardwired or softwired definition . in particular ,",
    "if a high amount of reticulation is expected ( e.g. as for certain groups of bacteria or plants ) the penalty should be smaller than in the case for when one expects the evolutionary history to be almost tree - like .    concerning the parallels of both the softwired and hardwired parsimony concepts to likelihood concepts on phylogenetic networks , we showed in the previous section that the equivalence fails as soon as a more meaningful likelihood concept , which assigns probabilities to all trees that are displayed by a network , is applied .",
    "however , it is easily seen that , if all such trees have the same probability , the rankings suggested by softwired parsimony and weighted softwired likelihood are identical and , thus , softwired mp and weighted softwired ml choose the same optimal networks . on the other hand ,",
    "if one wanted to employ a ( more biologically plausible ) non - uniform distribution on the trees displayed by a phylogenetic network , we conjecture that softwired parsimony and weighted softwired likelihood are equivalent if one changes the definition of softwired parsimony in a way that assigns a suitable scaling factor to each displayed tree . for future research",
    ", it will be interesting to prove this conjecture and to analyze how other definitions of likelihood on networks relate to parsimony .",
