    "the rise of the proton structure function @xmath9 towards small bjorken @xmath3 has been discussed since the existence of qcd . in the double asymptotic limit ( large energies , i.e. small @xmath3 , and large photon virtualities @xmath2 ) the dglap evolution equations  @xcite can be solved  @xcite and @xmath9 is expected to rise approximately like a power of @xmath3 towards low @xmath3 . a power like behaviour",
    "is also expected in the bfkl approach  @xcite .",
    "however , it soon was discussed  @xcite that this rise may eventually be limited by gluon self interactions in the nucleon , or more generally due to unitarity constraints .    experimentally this rise towards small @xmath3",
    "was first observed in 1993 in the hera data  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the precision of the @xmath9 data is much improved and the rise can be studied in great detail .",
    "the low @xmath3 behaviour of @xmath9 at fixed @xmath2 is studied locally by the measurement of the derivative @xmath10 as function of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the results are based on preliminary h1 @xmath9 data presented to this conference  @xcite covering the range @xmath11 gev@xmath5 and published h1 data  @xcite ,  @xcite which cover the range @xmath12 gev@xmath5 .",
    "the low @xmath2 @xmath9 data were obtained by shifting the @xmath13 interaction vertex by 70 cm in proton beam direction  @xcite . at @xmath14 gev@xmath5",
    "the h1 data are also shown combined with data of nmc  @xcite and zeus  @xcite .",
    "the derivative @xmath15 is evaluated using data points at adjacent values of @xmath3 at fixed @xmath2 taking into account error correlations and @xmath3 spacing corrections .",
    "the derivatives are compared with the next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd fit to the h1 cross section data  @xcite and a `` fractal '' fit  @xcite where self - similar properties of the proton structure are assumed .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 dependence of @xmath16 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : der1 ] .",
    "( 200,336 ) ( -15,220 . ) ( -15,5 . )    the new shifted vertex and the published data agree well in the overlap region .",
    "the derivative @xmath17 is constant within experimental uncertainties for fixed @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 , implying that the data are consistent with the power behaviour @xmath20 .",
    "fitting this form for each @xmath2 bin to the data at @xmath19 , results in the @xmath17 and @xmath21 values presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamh1 ] .",
    "( 200,315 ) ( -25,105 . )",
    "( -25,0 . )",
    "the results show that the @xmath22 data at low @xmath3 for @xmath23 gev@xmath5 can be well described by the very simple parameterisation @xmath24\\ ] ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 mev and @xmath27 .    at low @xmath2",
    "the deviation of @xmath17 from the logarithmic @xmath2 dependence and the decrease of @xmath28 is more significant if the h1 data are combined with nmc  @xcite and zeus  @xcite data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lammerge ] ) .",
    "( 200,315 ) ( -35,105 . )",
    "( -35,0 . )    the deviations from a simple constant respectively logarithmic behaviour occur at about such @xmath2 values below which perturbative qcd fits ( e.g.  @xcite ) are not supposed to be valid . at small @xmath2 the structure function @xmath9 can be related to the total virtual photon absorption cross section by @xmath29 where the total @xmath30 energy squared is given by @xmath31 . for @xmath32 we can expect @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the latter value corresponds to the energy dependence of soft hadronic interactions @xmath35 with @xmath36  @xcite which is approximately reached at @xmath37 gev@xmath5 .",
    "no significant deviation from the power behaviour @xmath38 at fixed @xmath2 is visible at present energies and @xmath39 gev@xmath40 . more specifically :    * for @xmath19 the derivative @xmath10 is independent of @xmath3 within errors .",
    "* @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath41 for @xmath42 gev@xmath5 , i.e. in the pqcd region . * here the data can be very simply parametrised by @xmath43 . * at @xmath44 gev@xmath5 deviations from the logarithmic @xmath2 dependence of @xmath17 are observed .",
    "* at low @xmath45 gev@xmath46 the energy rise is similar as in soft hadronic interactions .",
