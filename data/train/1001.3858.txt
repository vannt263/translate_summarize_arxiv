    "while the properties of hadrons are rather well known in free space ( embedded in a nonperturbative qcd vacuum ) the masses and lifetimes of hadrons in a baryonic and/or mesonic environment are subject of current research in order to achieve a better understanding of the strong interaction and the nature of confinement .",
    "a modification of vector mesons has been seen experimentally in the enhanced production of lepton pairs above known sources in nucleus - nucleus collisions at super - proton - synchroton ( sps ) energies @xcite .",
    "this can be attributed to a shortening of the lifetime of the vector mesons @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the question arises if the enhancement might ( in part ) be due to new radiative channels  @xcite from the strong quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "the answer to this question is nontrivial due to the nonequilibrium nature of the heavy - ion reactions and covariant transport models have to be incorporated to disentangle the various sources that contribute to the final dilepton spectra seen experimentally .",
    "to address the vector meson properties in a hot and dense medium  as created in heavy - ion collisions  we employ an up - to - date relativistic transport model , i.e. the parton hadron string dynamics  @xcite ( phsd ) that incorporates the relevant off - shell dynamics of the vector mesons as well as the explicit partonic phase in the early hot and dense reaction region .",
    "phsd consistently describes the full evolution of a relativistic heavy - ion collision from the initial hard scatterings and string formation through the dynamical deconfinement phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as well as hadronization and to the subsequent interactions in the hadronic phase .    in the hadronic sector phsd",
    "is equivalent to the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach @xcite that has been used for the description of @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions from sis to rhic energies and has lead to a fair reproduction of hadron abundances , rapidity distributions and transverse momentum spectra . in particular , hsd incorporates off - shell dynamics for vector mesons  according to refs .",
    "@xcite  and a set of vector - meson spectral functions  @xcite that covers possible scenarios for their in - medium modification . the transport theoretical description of quarks and gluons in phsd is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model for partons matched to reproduce lattice qcd results in thermodynamic equilibrium ( dqpm ) .",
    "the transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark - antiquark pairs to mesonic resonanses or three quarks ( antiquarks ) to baryonic states .",
    "various models predict that hadrons change in the ( hot and dense ) nuclear medium ; in particular , a broadening of the spectral function or a mass shift of the vector mesons has been expected .",
    "furthermore , qcd sum rules indicated that a mass shift may lead to a broadening and vice versa  @xcite ; therefore both modifications should be studied simultaneously .",
    "thus we explore three possible scenarios : ( 1 ) a broadening of the @xmath8 spectral function , ( 2 ) a mass shift , and ( 3 ) a broadening plus a mass shift . the hsd ( phsd ) off - shell transport approach allows to investigate in a consistent way the different scenarios for the modification of vector mesons in a hot and dense medium . in the off - shell transport ,",
    "hadron spectral functions change dynamically during the propagation through the medium and evolve towards the on - shell spectral function in the vacuum .    as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite the off - shell dynamics is particularly important for resonances with a rather long lifetime in vacuum but strongly decreasing lifetime in the nuclear medium ( especially @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons ) but also proves vital for the correct description of dilepton decays of @xmath8 mesons with masses close to the two pion decay threshold . for a detailed description of the various hadronic channels included for dilepton production as well as the off - shell dynamics we refer the reader to refs .",
    "by employing the hsd approach to the low mass dilepton production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , it was shown in  @xcite that the na60 collaboration data for the invariant mass spectra for @xmath13 pairs from in+in collisions at 158 a@xmath14gev favored the melting @xmath8 scenario @xcite . also the data from the ceres collaboration",
    "@xcite showed a preference for the melting @xmath8 picture . on the other hand , the dilepton spectrum from in+in collisions at 158 a@xmath14gev for @xmath15  gev",
    "could not be accounted for by the known hadronic sources ( see fig.2 of  @xcite ) .",
    "also , hadronic models do not reproduce the softening of the @xmath6 distribution of dileptons at @xmath15  gev  @xcite .",
    "this observation points towards a partonic origin but needs further examination .",
    "the transport theoretical description of the partonic dynamics in phsd is based on the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) @xcite which describes qcd properties in terms of single - particle green s functions ( in the sense of a two - particle irreducible approach ) and leads to effective strongly interacting partonic quasiparticles with broad spectral functions as degrees of freedom .",
    "dilepton radiation by the constituents of the strongly interacting qgp , i.e. by the dynamical quasiparticles , proceeds via the elementary processes illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] : the basic drell - yan @xmath16 annihilation mechanism , gluon compton scattering ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , and quark + anti - quark annihilation with gluon bremsstrahlung in the final state ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "note that in our calculations the running coupling @xmath20 depends on the local energy density @xmath21 according to the dpqm  @xcite , while the energy density is related to the temperature @xmath22 by the lqcd equation of state .",
    "numerically , we observe that @xmath20 is of the order @xmath23 and thus the contribution of the higher order diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] is not subleading !    in the on - shell approximation , one uses perturbative qcd cross sections for the processes listed above . however , to make a quantitative comparison to experimental data at the realistically low photon virtuality @xmath24  gev , one has to take into account the non - perturbative spectral functions and self - energies of the quarks , anti - quark and gluons thus going beyond the leading twist .",
    "therefore , we have derived the off - shell cross sections of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2(@xmath2 ) reactions by calculating the corresponding diagrams for massive quarks and gluons , with the masses being distributed according to the dqpm self energies . the obtained off - shell elementary cross sections then have been implemented into the phsd transport code .     at 158",

    "thus the result of  @xcite is confirmed by the phsd calculations . on the other hand ,",

    "we recall that hsd provides a reasonable description of hadron production in @xmath33 collisions at @xmath29 = 200 gev  @xcite such that we can directly continue with the results for @xmath31 pairs which are shown in fig .",

    "we step on with the case of inclusive @xmath35 collisions in comparison to the data from phenix  @xcite ( fig  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "when including the in - medium modification scenarios for the vector mesons , we achieve a sum spectrum which is only slightly enhanced compared to the free scenario . whereas the total yield is quite well described in the region of the pion dalitz decay as well as around the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mass",
    ", hsd clearly underestimates the measured spectra in the regime from 0.2 to 0.6 gev by an average factor of 3 .",
    "the low mass dilepton spectra from @xmath33 collisions at rhic ( from the phenix collaboration ) are clearly underestimated in the invariant mass range from 0.2 to 0.6 gev in the collisional broadening scenario as well as in the dropping mass + collisional broadening model , i.e. when assuming a shift of the vector meson mass poles with the baryon density .",
    "we mention that our results for the low mass dileptons are very close to the calculated spectra from van hees and rapp as well as dusling and zahed  @xcite ( cf . the comparison in ref .",
    "consequently we attribute this additional low mass enhancement seen by phenix to non - hadronic sources and will proceed with the quantitative test of this assumption in a future publication .",
