    "white dwarfs are the final stage of all low - mass stars and therefore all single stars in a globular cluster that currently finish their nuclear - burning lifetimes are expected to evolve into white dwarfs . as this has been the situation for many billions of years globular clusters should contain many white dwarfs .",
    "however , these stars managed to evade detection until photometric white dwarf sequences in globular clusters were discovered recently by observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) ( paresce et al .",
    "@xcite , richer et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , cool et al .",
    "@xcite , renzini et al .",
    "photometric observations contain only a limited amount of information : the two chemically distinct white dwarfs sequences ( hydrogen - rich da s and helium - rich db s ) in principle can be distinguished by their photometric properties alone in the temperature range @xmath0k ( see bergeron et al .",
    "renzini et al.(@xcite ) classified two white dwarfs in ngc6752 as db s by this method .",
    "however , without a spectral classification , both stars can also be explained as high mass da white dwarfs , possibly a product of merging .",
    "richer et al .  ( @xcite )",
    "speculate that the brightest white dwarf in m4 ( v=22.08 ) might be a hot ( 27,000k ) db star .",
    "the location of the white dwarf cooling sequence ( and thus the brightness of the white dwarfs ) is also sensitive to the white dwarf mass .",
    "renzini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) argued that the white dwarf masses in globular clusters are constrained to the narrow range 0.51@xmath1@xmath2 0.55@xmath1 , but some systematic differences between clusters are obvious : at a given metallicity some globular clusters ( e.g.  ngc6752 ) possess very blue horizontal branches ( hb s ) with hb star masses as low as 0.50@xmath1 .",
    "such extreme hb stars evolve directly to low - mass c / o white dwarfs ( bypassing the agb ) , shifting the mean white dwarf mass closer to 0.51@xmath1 .",
    "other clusters show only red hb stars , which will evolve to the agb and form preferably white dwarfs with masses of @xmath30.55@xmath1 .",
    "low - mass white dwarfs ( m@xmath40.45@xmath1 ) with a degenerate he core are produced if the red giant branch evolution is terminated by binary interaction before the helium core exceeds the minimum mass for helium burning .",
    "recently , cool et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found 3 faint uv - bright stars in ngc6397 which they suggest could be he white dwarfs ( supported by edmonds et al .",
    "massive white dwarfs may be produced from blue stragglers or by collisions of white dwarf - binaries with subsequent merging ( e.g. marsh et al .",
    "only a detailed spectroscopic investigation can provide masses and absolute luminosities of the individual globular cluster white dwarfs .",
    "this is also very important for the use of white dwarfs as standard candles to derive distances to globular clusters ( renzini et al .",
    "@xcite ) : the basic idea is to fit the white dwarf cooling sequence of a globular cluster to an appropriate empirical cooling sequence of local white dwarfs with well determined trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the procedure is analogous to the classical main sequence fitting but avoids the complications with metallicity ",
    "white dwarfs have virtually metal free atmospheres .",
    "in addition they are locally much more abundant than metal - poor subdwarfs .",
    "the arrival of the hipparcos results as well as new metallicity determinations have rekindled the debate on globular cluster distances ( see the review by reid @xcite and references therein ) . a further check on the distance is therefore urgently needed .",
    "we started an observing programme at the eso _ very large telescope ( vlt ) _ to obtain spectra of white dwarfs in globular clusters .",
    "the programme consists of two parts : first , low s / n ( @xmath5 ) spectra of the white dwarf candidates are obtained to verify their spectral type and estimate their effective temperatures . in a second run",
    "we plan to observe higher s / n ( @xmath6 ) spectra that will allow to derive @xmath7  with an internal error of @xmath8dex . here",

    "( @xcite ) targets brighter than @xmath9 were selected ( see fig .  [ cmd ] ) .",
    "the wfpc2 images were convolved to a seeing of 05 to select targets that are sufficiently uncrowded to be observable from the ground ( see table  [ targ ] and fig .  [ slits ] ) .",
    "the stars were observed with the _ focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph _ ( fors ) at unit telescope 1 of the vlt using the high resolution collimator ( 01/pixel ) to allow better extraction of the spectra and get a better handle on cosmic rays .",
    "we used the _ multi - object spectroscopy _ ( mos ) mode with the grism 300v and a slit width of 08 .",
    "the slit width was chosen to be larger than the required seeing to avoid slit losses due to imperfect pointing of the telescope .",
    "the data were obtained in service mode under excellent conditions ( seeing below 055 , no moon ) with a total exposure time of 90 minutes . the final resolution as judged from a wavelength calibration spectrum obtained with a 05 slit is @xmath311.5   .",

    "unfortunately wf4 - 205 lies so close to a bright star that even at this excellent seeing its spectrum could not be extracted .    due to the use of slit blades instead of fibers or masks",

    "the errors for the cooler stars are relatively small despite their low s / n because  at fixed @xmath7   the line profiles are much more sensitive to temperature variations at @xmath11@xmath311,000  k than at @xmath11@xmath318,000  k. the relatively large @xmath10 value for wf2 - 51 suggests that either the noise in this spectrum has been underestimated or that the spectrum contains additional features that are not well described by the model spectra .",

    "the longer distance moduli obtained for low - mass white dwarfs also result in masses for blue hb stars ( heber et al.@xcite ) and a hot post - agb star ( rob162 , heber & kudritzki @xcite ) that agree with canonical evolutionary theory .",
    "the distance moduli derived for a given @xmath7  from tables  [ targ ] and [ tab - results ] show a systematic variation with the brightest star ( wf4 - 358 ) yielding the smallest distance and the faintest star ( wf2 - 846 ) giving the largest distance .",
    "this variation could reflect the fact that the stars may not all have the same surface gravity : from their different apparent magnitudes ( i.e. different absolute magnitudes ) it is plausible that wf4 - 358 has the smallest @xmath7  and wf2 - 846 the largest .",
    "the quality of the current data , however , does not allow to verify this idea .",
    "using vlt - fors1 multi object spectroscopy we have confirmed four white dwarf candidates to be hydrogen - rich da white dwarfs .",
    "the gravity determined for the brightest star , wf4 - 358 , suggests that it could be a he white dwarf with a mass of ( 0.36@xmath170.12)@xmath1 , although the error bars are large enough to also accommodate a c / o white dwarf .",
    "temperatures derived for the three cooler and fainter stars for fixed @xmath7  would put them near the red edge of the zz ceti instability strip , for which bergeron et al.(@xcite ) determine a temperature range of 11,160  k to 12,460  k using their preferred ml2/@xmath28=0.6 prescription for the treatment of convection",
    ". therefore , a search for photometric variability of wf2 - 479 and wf2 - 51  if successful  could place important additional constraints on these stars .",
    "the systematic variation of the distance moduli derived for a given @xmath7  shows that the assumption of a constant mass for all white dwarfs in a globular cluster may bias a distance determination .",
    "however , due to the low s / n of the current data , these results are preliminary . once higher quality spectra are available , which will allow more accurate parameter ( and thus mass ) determinations , analyses of white dwarfs in globular clusters will become a powerful tool for independent distance estimates .",
