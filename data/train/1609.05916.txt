    "the gravitational - wave detections gw150914 and gw151226 are the first direct evidence of the formation and merger of stellar - mass binary black holes ( bbhs ) in the local universe @xcite .",
    "although many channels have been explored for the formation of such systems , most proposals fall into two categories : the `` field '' channel , in which bbhs are formed from isolated stellar binaries , usually involving either a common - envelope phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or chemically - homogeneous evolution due to rapid stellar rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the `` dynamical '' channel , in which bbhs are created though three - body encounters in dense star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the masses and merger rates predicted by these models often significantly overlap , making it difficult to discriminate between different formation channels for bbhs even with multiple detections .",
    "however , masses and merger rates are not the only observable predictions from bbh formation models .",
    "in particular , the distribution of bh spin orientations are expected to depend heavily on the binary formation mechanism .",
    "for bbhs from the field , it is expected that the individual bh spins should be mostly aligned with the orbital angular momentum @xcite , with any misalignment arising from the momentum `` kick '' imparted to the orbit during core collapse . for dynamically - formed bbhs , both the spin and orbital angular momenta",
    "should be randomly distributed on the sphere .",
    "these spin - tilt misalignments produce relativistic precession of the orbit , which can be detected through the amplitude modulations in the gravitational waveform as the binary changes its orientation with respect to the detector @xcite .    in this letter , we compare the expected distributions of spin - tilt misalignments for binaries formed from isolated binary stellar evolution to those formed from dynamical encounters in dense star clusters .",
    "we find that , for sufficiently massive systems ( such as gw150914 ) , measurements of the bbh spin - tilt will allow ligo to discriminate between dynamically- and field - formed binaries .",
    "in addition , we find that dynamics provides the best route to forming binaries with a significant component of the spins anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum . since advanced ligo can best constrain the component of the spin angular momentum that is aligned with the orbital angular momentum ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) we suggest that this may represent the best way to differentiate these bbh populations .",
    "in figure [ fig : cartoon ] we show the vectors and angles that describe the spin orientations of a bbh system . for any binary in which the total spin vector , @xmath0 , is misaligned with the orbital angular momentum , @xmath1",
    ", the entire system will precess about the total angular momentum , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we refer to the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , as the spin - orbit misalignment , or the spin - tilt .",
    "although restricting ourselves to only @xmath5 erases any information about the individual bh spins and their potential resonant configurations ( such as those studied in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is the component of the mass - weighted spin angular momentum perpendicular to the orbital plane , @xmath6\\cdot \\hat{l}$ ] , that is best constrained by advanced ligo .",
    "the components of the spins that lie in the plane of the orbit are responsible for the precession of @xmath3 about @xmath7 , which induces modulations in the amplitude of the gravitational waveform ; however , the bbhs detected by ligo have so far not yielded significant constraints on the in - plane spins of merging bhs @xcite .      for bbhs formed from stellar binaries in the isolated channel ,",
    "the primary mechanism for inducing a misalignment between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is the change in @xmath1 imparted by the natal kick ( nk ) .",
    "the change in linear momentum instantaneously imparted to the exploding star , from either emission of neutrinos or an assymetric explosion mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can significantly change the orbit of the binary , resulting in a change to @xmath5 .",
    "we use the binary stellar evolution ( bse , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) code to create a bbh population representative of the field .",
    "bse uses a series of metallicitiy - dependent fitted stellar tracks to rapidly model the evolution of stellar populations . for binaries ,",
    "bse also models stable and unstable mass transfer , tidal circularization , gravitational - wave emission , and the changes to the orbital angular momentum arising from kicks .",
    "in addition , our version of bse contains several modifications to low - metallicitiy stellar winds @xcite and core - collapse supernova ( sn ) @xcite required to form `` heavy '' bbhs such as gw150914 @xcite .",
    "our nk prescription is based on that developed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we assume that all compact objects receive a nk drawn a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion of @xmath8 ( used to model the observed velocities of pulsars in the galaxy , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , for bhs we also assume that some fraction of the mass ejected during core collapse will `` fall back '' onto the newly - formed proto - compact object .",
    "when this happens , conservation of momentum demands that the velocity of the bh be reduced by :    @xmath9    the fraction of material that falls back ( @xmath10 ) is proportional to the core mass of the bh progenitor ; for stars with large core masses ( those with a carbon - oxygen core mass greater than @xmath11 ) , the rapid sn prescription of @xcite assumes complete fallback of material onto the newly - formed bh ( i.e.  @xmath12 ) .",
    "this approximates the `` direct collapse '' of bh progenitors with proto - neutron star masses @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a more - massive pre - collapse core will produce a more - massive bh , accrete more fallback material , and experience a smaller nk .",
    "we can expect that bbhs formed from isolated binaries in the field should show less spin - orbit misalignment , especially as one considers binaries with heavy bh components .",
    "in addition , we consider two additional kick prescriptions for field bbh populations .",
    "our proportional kick prescription assumes a much simpler relationship between the new bh mass and the maximum ns mass , similar to that proposed for neutrino - driven kicks @xcite :    @xmath14    where we assume @xmath15 .",
    "we also consider the case where bhs recieve kicks comparable to those of nss , i.e. :    @xmath16    though as we discuss in section [ sec : disc ] , such kicks represent an extreme assumption not supported by current observations .",
    "in addition to varying the nk magnitudes , we also explore different nk directions . by default",
    ", most population synthesis studies have assumed kicks to be evenly distributed in solid angle about the sphere of the exploding star .",
    "however , pulsar observations have suggested a correlation between the kick direction and the spin - axis of the newly - formed proto - compact object ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we consider two cases : an isotropic case , where nks are distributed randomly in solid angle over the sphere of the star , and a polar case , where we assume that all nks are preferentially launched from a cone with an opening angle of @xmath17 about the spin axis of each star .    for each kick prescription , we consider 11 different stellar metallicities : 1.5@xmath18 , @xmath18 , 0.5@xmath18 , 0.375@xmath18 , 0.25@xmath18 , 0.125@xmath18 , 0.05@xmath18 , 0.0375@xmath18 , 0.025@xmath18 , 0.0125@xmath18 , and 0.005@xmath18 .",
    "we then evolve @xmath19 binaries in each metallicitiy bin for 50 myr with bse .",
    "we sample the primary mass from a @xmath20 power law from 18@xmath21 to @xmath22@xcite , and use a mass ratio distribution flat from 0 to 1 .",
    "the eccentricities are drawn from a thermal distribution , @xmath23 , and the initial semi - major axes from a distribution flat in @xmath24 from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "we limit our sample to only those bbhs that will merge from emission of gravitational waves in less than 13.8 gyr .    to assign spin - tilts to each binary , we assume that the only mechanism for misaligning the orbital and spin angular momenta is the nk .",
    "although bse does not keep track of the three - dimensional spin - misalignments during its evolution , we record the angle between the old and new @xmath3 after each nk .",
    "the total spin - tilt misalignment is the combination of the two tilts .",
    "we emphasize that this is a highly - conservative estimate : both mass transfer during the common envelope phase and tidal forces should realign the spins of the first and second components of the binary between the formation of the first and second bhs . however , this realignment would serve to decrease the large spin - tilts reported here , making the distinction between field and cluster populations even more distinct .",
    "see appendix [ app : a ] for details .",
    "finally we evolve each binary from a separation of @xmath27 to the separation where the binary enters the ligo band ( @xmath28 ) using the precession - averaged post - newtonian evolution in the ` precession ` package @xcite and assuming maximal spins for the bh components .",
    "this was done to report the spin - tilt misalignments that would be measurable by advanced ligo . in practice",
    ", the spin - tilt distributions do not change between formation and @xmath29 , since the couplings between @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath3 are @xmath32 corrections to the spin evolution .",
    "the differences in @xmath5 between @xmath27 and the seperation each binary enters the ligo band are also minor , but we report the @xmath28 values for comparison with previous results @xcite .      for bbhs formed in dense stellar environments ,",
    "we assume the orbital and spin angular momenta are completely random . as more than 99% of all bbhs that merge in the local universe from globular clusters",
    "are formed through complicated and chaotic dynamical interactions @xcite , bbhs from clusters should have @xmath3 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 isotropically distributed across the sphere . we conclude that @xmath35 , suggesting that clusters preferentially form binaries with spins lying in the plane of the orbit . since it has been shown @xcite that an isotropic distribution of bbh spins remains isotropic during inspiral , we assume cluster binaries to have randomly - distributed spins when they enter the ligo band . note that we are only considering the `` classical '' channel of dynamical formation ; many additional channels have been proposed in which dynamics can induce mergers in bbhs that formed from pre - existing stellar binaries , such as those driven to merger via kozai - lidov oscillations from either stellar - mass triples ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or binaries orbiting a super - massive bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or from binaries that form and potentially accrete gas in agn disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the spin distributions of such scenarios are worthy of future study , for simplicity we do not consider them here .",
    "because the magnitude of the bh nk decreases with increasing bh mass , we are most interested in the correlation between the spin - tilts and the binary masses . in figure",
    "[ fig : dist ] , we show the spin - tilt misalignment for each of our six models of field binaries , overlaid with the ( randomly distributed ) misalignments for bbhs from clusters . as expected , both",
    "the fallback and proportional prescriptions show a decreasing spin - tilt misalignment as a function of binary chirp mass , defined as @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , for binaries that experience polar kicks , the spin - orbit misalignments are limited to @xmath37 for the full ns kicks case , and @xmath38 for the fallback and proportional cases .",
    "this behavior is to be expected : in order to anti - align the orbital and spin angular momenta , the nks must be able to reverse the orbital angular momentum , which is best accomplished by a planar kick with sufficient speed to reverse the orbital velocity .",
    "however , the polar kick case explicitly excludes such planar kicks .",
    "the only exception would be the case where the first nk yields a misalignment @xmath39 , placing the second star in a position to emit a nk opposite to the direction of the orbital velocity .",
    "however , such large first kicks frequently unbind the binary , and any bbhs that survive are left with such large orbital separations that they will not merge within a hubble time .",
    "the large tilts in the isotropic models are best understood by decomposing the kick into two components : a polar component which can torque the orbit up to 90 , and a planar component , which can ( in some cases ) reverse the orbital velocity , flipping the orbit by 180. because the planar kick component can be launched in a direction opposite the orbital velocity , the binary can be pushed into a tighter orbit , allowing it to merge within a hubble time . on the other hand ,",
    "the polar component of the kicks is always tangential to the orbit ( for the first kick ) , increasing the orbital angular momentum and widening the orbit .",
    "this creates a bias for small nks and correspondingly small tilts in the polar kick models , since only those systems will remain bound and merge within a hubble time ( as noted by * ? ? ?",
    "even when we allow for full - ns nks independent of bh mass , the majority of systems do not show tilts beyond @xmath40 . in figure",
    "[ fig : frac ] , we show the fraction of bbhs in each model that have spin - tilts greater than @xmath40 as a function of chirp mass . for the polar kick models ,",
    "less than 1% of binaries achieve a spin - orbit misalignment of greater than @xmath40 at any given chirp mass . for isotropic kicks ,",
    "the possibility of a spin - flip is significantly increased , since an isotropic distribution allows for the planar kicks required to reverse the orbital velocity . however , these kick magnitudes must be on the order of and in the opposite direction to the orbital velocity . for the isotropic fallback and isotropic proportional models , only 7% and 10% of the low - mass binaries ( @xmath41 ) have sufficient kicks to flip the orbital angular momentum .",
    "this fraction decreases as a function of mass , such that the isotropic fallback model produces _ no _ spin - orbit misalignments for @xmath42 , while @xmath431% of binaries with @xmath44 can yield @xmath45 .",
    "only the isotropic full - ns kick model can produce significant fractions ( 10 - 30% ) of anti - aligned heavy bbhs .",
    "for dynamically - formed binaries , 50% of all systems show some anti - alignment of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , as expected for systems whose angular momenta are isotropically distributed on the sphere .",
    "figure [ fig : frac ] illustrates a key point of this letter : for sufficiently massive binaries , the most efficient way to produce systems with spin components anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum is through dynamical encounters .",
    "parameter estimation of the lower - mass bbh detected by advanced ligo , gw151226 , suggests a chirp mass of @xmath46 at the 90% credible level @xcite , and shows significant evidence for bh spins that are partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "given the analysis here , we can not rule out either a field- or dynamical - formation scenario for gw151226 . on the other hand , gw150914 , the most massive bbh merger detected to date ,",
    "was detected with a chirp mass of @xmath47 at 90% confidence @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that , if a bbh similar to gw150914 were detected with a measurably negative @xmath48 , it would strongly suggest a dynamical origin .",
    "although parameter estimation of gw150914 hinted at such a configuration , with a measured an aligned - spin value of @xmath49 at a 90% confidence , such a measurement does not definitively rule out either large , in - plane spins ( which would also arise from dynamical formation ) or small , aligned spins .    for systems similar to gw150914 ,",
    "figure [ fig : dist ] shows that only full - ns nks delivered in the plane of the orbit could produce a spin - orbit misalignment greater than @xmath40 .",
    "however , we consider such kicks to be highly unlikely .",
    "previous studies have indicated that such strong nks would reduce the bbh merger rate from dense stellar environments by an order of magnitude @xcite , and from the field by two orders of magnitude @xcite . even under optimistic assumptions",
    ", this would yield a combined merger rate of bbhs in the local universe of @xmath50 , below the 90% lower - limit of @xmath51 reported from the first observing run of advanced ligo @xcite .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that bhs can receive such strong nks across all mass ranges .",
    "it should be mentioned that recent analyses of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the galaxy have suggested that , while most bhs are consistent with no nks at formation , at least a few bhs may receive nks as high as @xmath52 @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite noted that two lmxb systems , xte j1118 + 48 and 0h1705 - 250 , must have received kicks of at least @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively to explain their current positions in the galaxy ; however , all of the nk prescriptions employed here can produce kicks of this magnitude for @xmath54 bhs ( see appendix [ app : a ] , figure [ fig : speeds ] ) , making our results consistent with the observed positions of these lmxbs .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the estimated birth velocity of h1705 - 250 can be explained by uncertainties in the observed position of the lmxb , without the need to invoke such large nks @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have assumed that the amount of material that falls back on the proto - compact object will reduce the velocity of the bh via conservation of momentum .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the fallback of material can actually _ accelerate _ the bh to speeds similar to neutron stars , either via asymmetric accretion or though a gravitational `` tug - boat '' mechanism powered by the asymmetric ejecta @xcite .",
    "however , such behavior would still only apply to bhs that eject some amount of material . for heavy bbhs such as gw150914 , these prescriptions suggest that the bhs would form in a direct collapse with no significant mass ejecta @xcite .",
    "a direct collapse would also eliminate the possibility of an asymmetric sn altering the spin of the compact object itself ( as has been invoked to explain the spin - misalignment of the double pulsar system psr j07373039 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in this letter , we explore the spin - tilt distributions of bbhs from different formation channels . we have shown for heavy bbh systems , such as gw150914",
    ", the allowed range of spin - orbit misalignments that can be produced by bh nks is limited . only under the extreme case where bhs of all masses can recieve nks comparable to nss , can isolated stellar evolution",
    "produce spin - tilt misalignment greater than @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "bbhs formed through dynamical processes in dense star clusters are expected to produce isotropically - distributed spin - tilt misalignments , which easily allow for the formation of bbhs with significantly anti - aligned spin and orbital angular momenta . since any model of bh formation that allows for full - ns nks results in a predicted bbh merger rate below the 90% lower - limit observed by advanced ligo",
    ", we conclude that any sufficiently - massive bbh merger ( @xmath55 , depending on the driving mechanism of the nk ) that shows a negative @xmath48 was most likely formed through dynamical processes .",
    "there are many additional facets of the bbh spin problem to be considered : first , although 50% of dynamically - formed binaries will have @xmath56 ( assuming non - zero component spins ) , this does _ not _ mean that 50% of binaries detected by ligo from clusters will have clearly discernible @xmath56 .",
    "systems with @xmath57 are detectable at greater distances than systems with @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , systems with large spins in the plane of the orbit ( the most probable configuration for dynamically - formed binaries ) will precess , producing amplitude modulations that can further decrease detectibility of rapidly - spinning binaries .",
    "given that dynamics preferentially forms bbhs with spins lying in the orbital plane , such precessional effects may offer the best chance for identifying dynamically - formed bbhs . although precession has not been observed in the two bbhs detected so far",
    ", improvements in the lower - frequency limit of the ligo instrument will increase the number of precessional periods a binary experiences while in the ligo band , significantly improving the ability to measure the in - plane component of the bh spins .",
    "studies to fully characterize the detection rate and distinguishability of these two astrophysical populations ( similar to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are currently underway .",

    "this is done using the formalism developed in the appendix of the original bse paper @xcite .",
    "briefly , when bse applies a kick to a binary , it assumes a coordinate system with the non - exploding star at the origin and the exploding star placed a position @xmath59 along the @xmath60 axis .",
    "the instantaneous orbital velocity lies in the @xmath61-@xmath62 plane and the orbital angular momentum vector , @xmath1 , points in the @xmath63 direction .",
    "when the sn occurs , a kick is added to the orbital velocity , such that @xmath64 .",
    "we show an example of the kick magnitudes for a single stellar metallicity in figure [ fig : speeds ] . since we assume that the nk is applied instantaneously on the orbital timescale of the binary , the separation does not change .",
    "the new direction of the orbital angular momentum vector is simply @xmath65 , and the angle between the new and old angular momenta , @xmath66 , is @xmath67 .",
    "because bse considers the orbit - averaged evolution of the binary , we can track the angle that @xmath68 makes with @xmath3 , but not the phase of the projection of @xmath3 into the orbital plane .",
    "to that end , we select a random angle @xmath69 from @xmath70 to @xmath71 for the orbital phase of @xmath3 in the new orbital plane .",
    "the total spin - misalignment is then      where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the tilts created after the first and second nks .",
    "note that this is identical to equation 7 in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the timescale between the formation of the first and second bhs is sufficiently short that neither tides nor mass transfer can significantly realign the spin of the second star between the two sn .",
    "as such , our field binaries all have @xmath75 by construction .",
    "this is considered a conservative assumption , as any physics which realigns @xmath76 or @xmath77 with @xmath1 will necessary produce smaller tilts than those reported in the main text .",
    "as an illustration , we recreate figure [ fig : dist ] , assuming that both spins realign with the orbital angular momentum before the second bh forms ( i.e.  @xmath78 ) . see figure [ fig : dist_2nd ] ."
