    "analysing the statistical properties of strong gravitational lensing in a sample of cosmologically distant sources provides a method for constraining cosmological parameters ( e.g.  turner 1990 ; fukugita , futamase , & kasai 1990 ; fukugita & turner 1991 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ; carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) as well as for constraining global properties of galaxy populations including evolutions ( e.g.  maoz & rix 1993 ; kochanek 1993 ; mao & kochanek 1994 ; king & browne 1996 ) . the observed statistical properties of gravitational lensing in a sample are the total rate of multiple - imaging , the image separations , the lens redshifts , the source redshifts , and the image multiplicities .",
    "these properties depend not only on cosmological parameters but also on the following properties of galaxies and sources ( e.g.  turner , ostriker , & gott 1984 ; turner 1990 ; fukugita & turner 1991 ; mao 1991 ; kochanek 1993 ; maoz & rix 1993 ; wallington & narayan 1993 ; mao & kochanek 1994 ; king & browne 1996 ; kochanek 1996a , b ) : ( 1 ) the galaxy luminosity functions per morphological type ( and their evolutions of any relevance to lensing ) and the projected mass distribution in the inner cylindrical region of a galaxy of given luminosity and morphological type ; and ( 2 ) the distribution of the sources in redshift and flux in the observational selection waveband ( e.g.  radio ) . because of the dependences of the statistical properties of gravitational lensing on the above multiple factors , analyses of statistical lensing can be used for various purposes . on the other hand , in order to derive reliable results from an analysis of statistical lensing , it is vital to properly take into account all the factors through a statistical lensing model based on reliable data .    in this paper",
    "we perform extensive analyses of statistical lensing based on more reliable sets of data than were available previously and using a more realistic statistical lensing model .",
    "essential results on cosmological parameters from ( part of ) the analyses are reported in chae et al .",
    ". however , in this paper we present not only the details of the analyses but also comprehensive results of the analyses for a broader range of parameters . in particular , we derive and discuss the global properties of the galaxies . in comparison to previous works on statistical lensing that attempted to put limits on cosmological parameters ( e.g.  kochanek 1996a ; falco , kochanek , & muoz 1998 ; chiba & yoshii 1999 ; helbig et al .  1999 ; cooray 1999 ) , the following aspects of this work can be pointed out :    1 .",
    "this work is based on the final cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class : myers et al .",
    "2003 ; browne et al .",
    "2003 ) statistical sample of 8958 radio sources [ which includes jodrell - bank  vla astrometric survey ( jvas ) sources as a subsample ] containing 13 multiply - imaged sources , which is the largest statistical sample that satisfies well - defined observational selection criteria",
    "this work is based on estimates of luminosity functions of galaxies per morphological type that have been derived taking into account latest results from large - scale observations of galaxies particularly including the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "we adopt a statistical lensing model in which we not only use elliptical projected densities for galaxies but also incorporate intrinsic shapes of galaxies .",
    "the adopted galactic model is the axisymmetric ( i.e.  oblate and prolate ) singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) with a distribution function of the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the relative energy and the angular momentum component parallel to the symmetry axis .",
    "this work is intended to provide robust constraints in cosmological parameter space .",
    "we make the least possible prior assumptions on the parameters of the assumed statistical lensing model and constrain the parameters self - consistently from the data of statistical lensing .",
    "this work is intended to be an investigation of global properties of galaxy populations ; namely , characteristic velocity dispersion(s ) for the early - type ( and the late - type ) galaxy population(s ) , mean apparent mass axial ratio of galaxies , and intrinsic shapes of galaxies .",
    "these investigations are made possible by the use of the ( 3-dimensional ) ellipsoidal lens model [ the above point  ( iii ) ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we build up the statistical lensing model based on the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) mass model for a galaxy , including the calculation of the cross sections for double - imaging and quadruple - imaging as functions of line - of - sight velocity dispersion , apparent ellipticity and assumed intrinsic shape distributions , and the calculation of magnification biases for double - imaging and quadruple - imaging . in section 2",
    ", we also define the likelihood function for the data given the model of statistical lensing . in section  3 ,",
    "we summarize the input data for the analyses including the final class statistical sample , distribution of the class sources in redshift and radio flux density , and galaxy luminosity functions per morphological type .",
    "the results of fitting the model to the data are presented in section  4 . in section  5 ,",
    "we discuss the derived results including comparison with previous results from statistical lensing and examination of possible systematics that could affect the derived results . in section  6",
    ", we discuss future prospects of statistical lensing .",
    "conclusions are given in section  7 .",
    "the isothermal mass profile ( i.e.  the density @xmath22 ) has been widely used for analyses of statistical lensing ( e.g.  turner , ostriker , & gott 1984 ; fukugita & turner 1991 ; kochanek 1993 ; maoz & rix 1993 ; wallington & narayan 1993 ; mao & kochanek 1994 ; king & browne 1996 ; kochanek 1996a , b ; falco , kochanek , & muoz 1998 ; chiba & yoshii 1999 ; helbig et al .  1999 ; cooray 1999 ; rusin & tegmark 2001 ) , because of the analytical tractability of the isothermal profile and because the projected surface density of the inner cylindrical regions of lensing galaxies probed by strong gravitational lensing are either consistent with or not too different from the isothermal profile .. ] isothermal mass models would , in general , be too simplified to allow us to do accurate modelling of individual lenses ( see , e.g. , muoz , kochanek , & keeton 2001 ; chae 2002 ) , but they should suffice at least as first - order approximations to the mean properties of galaxies relevant to statistical lensing .",
    "thus , following the literature on statistical lensing , we adopt the isothermal mass profile for our analyses . however , we use a more general isothermal model that incorporates not only a galaxy s apparent axial ratio but also its intrinsic shape .",
    "the projected surface density of the sie lens @xmath23 can be written in units of the critical surface density @xmath24 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the minor - to - major axial ratio of the surface density and is equal to @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the ellipticity ) , @xmath29 is the hubble length @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the angular diameter distance between redshift @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) in units of @xmath29 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the lens and the source redshifts . in equation  ( 1 ) , @xmath37 is the critical radius for the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) ( i.e.  for @xmath38 ) and is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the galaxy . for the case of the sis ,",
    "only double imaging is allowed and the cross section for the double imaging is @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , quadruple imaging ( and triple imaging for a sufficiently flattened surface density ; see below ) is possible in addition to double imaging , and the relations between the multiple - imaging cross sections and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the galaxy are not unique but depend on the intrinsic shape , the viewing direction , and the distribution function of the galaxy .",
    "this dependence is parametrised by @xmath43 ( ` dynamical normalisation ' ) in equation  ( 1 ) . in our parametrisation of the sie in equation  ( 1 ) ,",
    "@xmath44 and the case @xmath45 for any @xmath26 corresponds to the normalisation in which the mass within the area enclosed by an equi - density ellipse is independent of @xmath26 ( see kormann , schneider , & bartelmann 1994 ) . as shown in kormann , schneider , & bartelmann ( 1994 ) , for @xmath46 triple imaging with comparable brightnesses for all three images is possible due to a naked cusp radial caustic .",
    "the cross section for the naked - cusp triple - imaging is expected to be small and no case has been found from the class ( browne et al .",
    "hence we ignore the possibility in the following analyses .",
    "let @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote respectively the double imaging and the quadruple imaging cross sections in units of @xmath49 for the case of @xmath50 for any @xmath26 .",
    "then , for any given @xmath43 , the double ( quadruple ) imaging cross section @xmath51 [ @xmath52 in units of @xmath49 is given by @xmath53 ^ 2 \\hat{s}_2 ( f)$ ] \\{@xmath54 ^ 2\\hat{s}_4(f)$]}. the cross sections for the double imaging and the quadruple imaging for @xmath50 are respectively given by ( kormann et al .",

    "thus , the double imaging cross section that satisfies the observational limit on the image magnification ratio is less than that given by equation  ( 4 ) but it can be calculated numerically through a monte carlo method .",

    "the azimuthal component of the velocity distribution at a point includes streaming rotation motion as well as random motions .",
    "we use the mean squared azimuthal velocity , to be denoted by @xmath75 , for our dynamical normalisation calculations since measured line - of - sight velocity dispersions over a large aperture include contributions from any streaming motions . for the axisymmetric scale - free isothermal model given by equation  ( 6 ) , the second velocity moments can be calculated analytically and the expressions include only elementary functions ( see , e.g. , van der marel 1994 ; qian et al .",

    "however , the relative frequency for the doubles is higher than that in the class subsample used by rusin & tegmark ( 2001 ) , in which there are 5 doubles and 7 quadruples .",
    "this difference is for two reasons .",
    "first , in the time since rusin & tegmark ( 2001 ) did their analysis based on class lens systems available at that time , the class group has identified two new lens systems 0445 + 123 ( argo et al .",
    "2003 ) and 0631 + 519 , both of which are doubly - imaged systems and are now included in the final class statistical sample .",
    "second , the observational criteria used to define the final class statistical sample ( section  3.1 ) are not only more stringent but more reliable than those used to define the statistical sample used by rusin & tegmark ( 2001 ) . based on their statistical sample and",
    "the sie lens model , rusin & tegmark ( 2001 ) concluded that the predicted mean mass ellipticity of the early - type galaxies ( @xmath283 ) was much higher than an observed mean light ellipticity .",
    "in particular , rusin & tegmark ( 2001 ) found that the observed ellipticity distribution of the early - type galaxies in the coma cluster was inconsistent with the relative frequencies of the doubles and the quadruples in their sample at 98% statistical significance .",
    "based on the final class statistical sample and the sie lens model , we find that the best - fit mean mass ellipticity for the ( early - type ) galaxies is @xmath18 ( fig .  9",
    "; table  5 ) and the 68% lower limit is @xmath284 for the dynamical normalisation of the equal frequencies of the oblates and the prolates . for the dynamical normalisation of all oblates ,",
    "the 68% lower limit is increased to 0.34 . for the dynamical normalisation of all prolates ,",
    "@xmath285 at 68% . these results are consistent with the observed mean light ellipticity @xmath286 ( fig .",
    "18 in i m et al .",
    "2002 ) for the field early - type galaxies of the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep ) gross strip survey ( gss ) or @xmath287 for the combined e and s0 galaxies in the coma cluster [ fig .",
    "3(a ) in j@xmath288rgensen & franx 1994 ] . therefore , the potential ` ellipticity crisis ' for gravitational lenses that were noticed and investigated in the previous works ( rusin & tegmark 2001 ; kochanek 1996a ; king & browne 1996 ) based on samples that are not as well - defined as the final class statistical sample , has now significantly weakened .        in this work",
    ", we adopted the singular isothermal mass profile and the axisymmetric intrinsic shapes ( i.e. , oblate and prolate ) to model galaxy lenses .",
    "we also assumed that the distribution function of a galaxy depends only on the relative energy and the angular momentum component parallel to the symmetry axis of the galaxy . with the adopted mass model and the assumption on the distribution function",
    ", we calculated , as functions of apparent axial ratio and line - of - sight velocity dispersion , the multiple - imaging cross sections averaged over all the combinations of intrinsic shapes and inclination angles that are consistent with the apparent axial ratio for the assumed relative frequencies of oblates and prolates .",
    "the apparent axial ratio and the characteristic velocity dispersions ( corresponding to the characteristic absolute magnitudes ) were then constrained by the observed relative frequencies of image multiplicities and the observed image separations in the final class statistical sample .",
    "we found that the values of the early - type characteristic velocity dispersion obtained in the way described above agreed well with the values based on the early - type characteristic absolute magnitude and a faber - jackson relation or a @xmath275-@xmath276 relation ( recall here that a singular isothermal mass profile was also assumed ; see section  4 ) .",
    "the values of the late - type characteristic velocity dispersion obtained from the statistical lensing analyses were @xmath289 lower than the value based on the late - type characteristic absolute magnitude and a tully - fisher relation",
    ".    how would the derived results from the statistical lensing analyses be affected if non - isothermal mass profiles , non - axisymmetric intrinsic shapes , and/or general three - integral distribution functions of galaxies were considered ?",
    "constraints on cosmological parameters are not likely to be affected by non - isothermal mass profiles , non - axisymmetric intrinsic shapes , or general distribution functions according to the following arguments . for",
    "the given apparent axial ratio and line - of - sight velocity dispersion , the cross sections averaged over the allowed ensemble of models obviously depend on the assumed galaxy model .",
    "hence , the derived characteristic velocity dispersions from the observed image separations depend on the mass profile , the allowed range of intrinsic shapes , and the assumption on the distribution function of the galaxy .",
    "( dependences on the intrinsic shapes for the singular isothermal mass profile were illustrated in section  4 .",
    ") however , while the derived characteristic velocity dispersions are affected as the galaxy model is varied , the multiple - imaging cross sections are not as long as the projected surface density of the inner cylindrical region of the galaxy is similar to the isothermal surface density .",
    "in other words , the observed image separations will determine the multiple - imaging cross sections regardless of the details of the galaxy model as long as the image separation for the given multiple - imaging cross section is not significantly dependent on the image magnification ratio , similarly to the case for the singular isothermal profile in which the image separation is fixed by the cross section and independent of the magnification ratio .      as discussed in section  3.3 , there is no consensus among observationally derived results for the early - type lf .",
    "we have used two choices of the early - type lf in this work , namely the steep ssrs2 choice and the shallow 2dfgrs choice . as seen in section  4 , while the two different early - type lfs require different values of @xmath11 to fit the same image separations in the class statistical sample , the difference in the values of @xmath184 for the two early - type lfs is such that the two early - type lfs give similar results on cosmological parameters ( fig .",
    ". however , the fact that the two different early - type lfs give similar results on cosmological parameters does not preclude the possibility that the presently derived constraints on cosmological parameters based on the two early - type lfs suffer from systematic errors due to the present uncertainties in the early - type lf .",
    "as pointed out in section  3.3 , the main difficulty in the observational derivation of the early - type lf lies in classifying large numbers of galaxies by morphological types .",
    "systematically misclassifying galaxies will not only result in an error in the number density of early - type galaxies but also an error in the faint - end slope in the early - type lf .",
    "given that the derived cosmological parameters depend on both the early - type characteristic number density and faint - end slope , it is understood that the presently derived constraints on cosmological parameters are potentially susceptible to unquantified systematic errors due to the present uncertainties in the early - type lf .",
    "nonetheless , since the total galaxy lf has been reliably determined , as long as the partition of the total lf into the type - specific lfs is not drastically different from those considered in this work , the conclusions drawn on cosmological parameters ( section  4.1 ) would not be significantly affected .",
    "one key assumption made in this work is no evolution of early - type galaxies since @xmath0 in the sense that the early - type characteristic comoving number density and faint - end slope are unchanged from @xmath0 to the present epoch . in section  3.3",
    ", we pointed out that the hypothesis of the early ( @xmath290 ) formation and passive evolution of early - type galaxies is supported by many lines of observational studies .",
    "however , the evolution of early - type galaxies remains a relatively larger source of uncertainty for analyses of statistical lensing .",
    "first , the observational results that provided the most direct pieces of evidence for little or no evolution of the early - type characteristic comoving number density and faint - end slope were based on relatively small samples of galaxies and were less than abundant .",
    "furthermore , limits on galaxy evolution derived from galaxy counts are dependent on the assumed cosmological model and thus , in a strict sense , should not be used for constraining cosmological parameters via statistical lensing ( see , e.g. , keeton 2002 ) .",
    "second , there exist observational results in the literature that have been used to claim a rapid evolution of early - type galaxies in which there is a significant reduction in the comoving number density of early - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath291 ) compared with the present epoch .",
    "if future observational studies established a rapid evolution in the population of early - type galaxies since @xmath0 so that the comoving number density of early - type galaxies at an intermediate redshift was significantly lower than that at the present epoch , the constraints on cosmological parameters derived in this work would have to be adjusted ; the adjustment would increase ( decrease ) dark energy density ( matter density ) . reversing the problem ,",
    "statistical lensing can be used in the future to constrain the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies assuming a certain cosmological model . from the results of this work ,",
    "the qualitative inference on the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies would be that a flat ` concordance cosmology ' with @xmath292 ( @xmath273 ) favors an early ( @xmath293 ) formation of early - type galaxies followed by passive evolution .",
    "a detailed quantitative analysis of statistical lensing focusing on constraining the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies assuming the concordance cosmology will be presented in a forthcoming publication ( mao & chae 2003 ) .      as shown in figure  10(a ) , the derived value of @xmath242 ( in a flat universe ) is sensitive to the mean redshift of class sources . since the marlow et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measurement has a relatively large uncertainty due to the relatively small number of measured spectroscopic redshifts , it will be important to obtain secure redshifts for more class sources in the future to reduce the uncertainty arising from the current uncertainty in the mean redshift of class sources .",
    "six multiply - imaged sources in the final class statistical sample ( table  1 ) lack measured redshifts . while the unknown redshifts would not change the derived results from analyses of statistical lensing as long as they are not too close to their corresponding lens redshifts , although this interpretation was very uncertain ( fassnacht et al .",
    "it would be important to measure them not just as a matter of completeness but to make sure that no surprising results are missed .",
    "as demonstrated in detail in this work , statistical properties of strong gravitational lensing allow us to probe independently cosmological models and global properties of galaxies . in principle , a sample of cosmologically distant sources that is observationally well - defined and large enough can alone pin down both cosmological parameters ( e.g.  @xmath242 , @xmath181 , and @xmath294 ) and global parameters of galaxies ( e.g.  @xmath185 , early - type velocity function slope , @xmath226 , spiral - type velocity function slope , and @xmath295 ) including their evolutionary properties . since determining cosmological parameters and global properties of galaxies is a main and fundamental part of cosmology , it is important to have various independent methods .",
    "statistical lensing provides such a method .",
    "the cosmic lens all - sky survey is the largest systematic strong gravitational lens survey at the time of this writing .",
    "a second cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class2 ) is being planned and would aim to discover ten times as many multiply - imaged radio - loud sources as the class did .",
    "a statistical sample from a class2 project would allow us to measure cosmological and galactic parameters with three times smaller statistical errors compared with the values obtained in this work assuming that the errors are poissonian [ this appears to be the case from the comparison of fig .",
    "12  ( c ) or ( d ) with fig .  6  ( a ) ( see section  5.2 ) and we will deal with the issue regarding errors in a future publication through an extensive monte carlo simulation of statistical lensing ( chae et al . , in preparation ) ] .",
    "for example , this means that statistical lensing could independently come up with a value of @xmath242 ( or @xmath182 ) with an error of @xmath296 ( if a flat universe is assumed ) and values of @xmath185 and @xmath226 with errors of @xmath297  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "it is almost certain that statistical lensing will not enable us to measure cosmological parameters with the precision that is achievable by cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements or supernovae observations through space - based instruments for the present and the coming decade [ e.g. , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ : spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) ; planck surveyor ; supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) ]",
    ". nevertheless , independent results on cosmological parameters from statistical lensing are of interest and value because the importance of cosmological parameters warrants demanding tests .",
    "however , perhaps the greatest value of statistical lensing for the coming years lies in its unique probe of the velocity functions of galaxies and galaxy evolution .",
    "in particular , the velocity dispersions implied by the image separations of strongly - lensed systems are different from those measured spectroscopically from galaxy surveys such as the sdss , and statistical lensing probes galaxy evolution based on mass - selected samples of galaxies whereas studies from galaxy surveys are based on brightness - selected samples .",
    "thus , statistical lensing provides valuable and unique constraints on theories of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "from the analyses of statistical lensing based on the final class statistical sample , the current estimate of luminosity functions of galaxies per morphological type , and the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) lens model , we have reached the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the multiple - imaging cross sections of galaxies implied by the observed image separations are such that the observed ` local ' distributions of galaxies require a cosmological model dominated by dark energy to be compatible with the observed multiple - imaging rate , under the assumption that field early - type ( i.e.  e / s0 ) galaxies existed with the present - epoch abundance and masses at intermediate redshifts @xmath201 . in particular , the confidence region in the @xmath242-@xmath181 plane is in good agreement with that from type  ia supernovae observations ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "this independent result further supports a flat concordance cosmology with @xmath298 ( @xmath299 ) .",
    "however , if the early - type galaxy population underwent a significant evolution from @xmath0 to the present epoch as in a certain hierarchical galaxy formation picture , the statistical lensing data used in this work would imply an even higher dark energy density .",
    "2 .   assuming that one half of early - type galaxies are oblates and the other half are prolates",
    ", the fitted early - type characteristic line - of - sight velocity dispersion is @xmath300  km  s@xmath14 ( 68% ) if the early - type lf faint - end slope follows that of the ` steep ' ssrs2 early - type lf ( i.e.  @xmath15 ) , or @xmath301  km  s@xmath14 ( 68% ) if it follows that of the ` shallow ' 2dfgrs early - type lf ( i.e.  @xmath17 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the current estimate of the early - type characteristic absolute magnitude in the @xmath302 band and the @xmath40-@xmath276 relation , but are significantly lower than the previous result based on the optically - selected lens sample and the ssrs2-like steep early - type faint - end slope .",
    "3 .   assuming that one half of early - type galaxies are oblates and the other half are prolates , the best - fit value for the mean projected mass ellipticity of early - type galaxies is 0.42 and the 68% lower limit is 0.28 .",
    "the inferred mean projected mass ellipticity agrees well with the measured mean light ellipticity of early - type galaxies in ` fields ' ( i.e. , random environments ) or in clusters .",
