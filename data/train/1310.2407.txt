    "the toda equation and the lotka - volterra ( lv ) system are the basic integrable systems which describe the current - voltage in an electric circuit and a prey - predator relationship of distinct species , respectively .",
    "the discrete toda equation @xcite is a time - discretization of the toda equation , and is known to be just equal to the recursion formula of the qd algorithm for computing eigenvalues of symmetric tridiagonal matrix @xcite and singular values of bidiagonal one @xcite .",
    "the discrete lv ( dlv ) system @xcite , which is a time - discretization of the lv system , also has an interesting application to computing for bidiagonal singular values @xcite .",
    "the solutions to both the discrete toda equation and the dlv system are expressed by using the hankel determinant , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond the discrete spatial variable and the discrete time one , respectively @xcite . here , the formal power series @xmath3 associated with @xmath4 is assumed to be analytic at @xmath5 and meromorphic in the disk @xmath6 .",
    "the finite or infinite number of poles @xmath7 of @xmath8 are numbered such that @xmath9 .",
    "then , there exists a nonzero constant @xmath10 independent of @xmath2 such that , for @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 , @xmath13 as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the hankel determinant as @xmath14 enables us to analyze the discrete toda equation and the dlv system asymptotically as in @xcite and in @xcite , respectively .    a generalization of the hankel determinant @xmath15 is the determinant of a nonsymmetric square matrix of order @xmath1 , @xmath16 which is called the casorati determinant , or the casoratian .",
    "according to @xcite , the casoratian is a useful determinant in the theory of difference equations , which plays the role similar to the wronskian in the theory of differential equations , and it has some applications to difference equations in mathematical physics .",
    "no one feels something wrong that the formal power series @xmath17 is associated with the casorati determinant @xmath18 for each @xmath19 .",
    "the formal power series @xmath20 differ from @xmath8 in that not only the subscripts but also superscripts appear in the coefficients .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present an asymptotic expansion of @xmath18 as @xmath21 . as an application of it , we also give an asymptotic analysis for the discrete hungry lv ( dhlv ) system , which is a generalization of the dlv system .",
    "the dhlv system is a time - discretization of the hungry lv ( hlv ) system @xcite which grasps more complicated prey - predator relation , and is shown in @xcite to enable us to give the @xmath22 and the sifted @xmath22 transformations for computing eigenvalues of a banded totally nonnegative matrix whose all minors are nonnegative .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we first observe that the entries in @xmath18 can be expressed by using poles of @xmath23 .",
    "we next give an asymptotic expansion of the casorati determinant in terms of poles of @xmath23 as @xmath14 by expanding the theorem on analyticity for hankel determinant in @xcite . with the help of the resulting theorem , in section 3",
    ", we also clarify asymptotic behaviors of the solution to the dhlv system .",
    "finally , we give concluding remark in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we first give an expression of the entries of the casorati determinant @xmath18 in terms of the poles of the formal power series @xmath23 associated with @xmath18 . referring to the theorem on analyticity for hankel determinant in @xcite , we next present an asymptotic expansion of the casorati determinant @xmath18 as @xmath14 by using the poles of @xmath23 .",
    "we also describe an asymptotic expansion of @xmath18 as @xmath14 under some restriction on the poles of @xmath24    let @xmath25 , which is the formal power series associated with @xmath18 for @xmath26 be analytic at @xmath5 and meromorphic in the disk @xmath27 . moreover , let @xmath28 denote the poles of @xmath23 such that @xmath29 . by extracting the principal parts in @xmath23",

    "for example , it follows that @xmath62 it is easy to check all the permutations for @xmath63 in the @xmath55nd summation .",
    "thus , we can rewrite the second summation as @xmath64 therefore , by taking account that @xmath65 , from  we get .",
    "hereinafter , let us consider the restricted case where @xmath66 in @xmath23 .",
    "this restriction admits the relationship of @xmath67 , for example , appearing in the next section concerning an asymptotic analysis for dhlv system as @xmath14 .",
    "then , by the replacement of @xmath68 with @xmath69 in , we easily get @xmath70 as a specialization of theorem [ casoratiasgen ] , we thus derive the following theorem for an asymptotic expansion of the casorati determinant @xmath18 with the restricted @xmath37 as @xmath14 .",

    "in this section , we first explain that the solution to the dhlv system is written in terms of the casorati determinant by using theorem [ casorati ] , we next clarify an asymptotic behavior of the dhlv variables as @xmath14 .",
    "the hlv system is known as one of the mathematical prey - predator models which is an extension of the lv system .",
    "the hlv system differs from the simple lv system in that more than one food and predator exists for each species .",
    "a skillful discretization of the hlv system enable us to give the dhlv system with hungry degree @xmath82 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the number of the @xmath19th species and the discretization parameter at the discrete time @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the dhlv system with @xmath86 coincides with the simple lv system .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the dhlv system with @xmath87 is derived from starting the discussion on three - term recurrence @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , it is easy to get the arbitrary integer case of @xmath82 through considering the three - term recurrence @xmath89 . at a first glance",
    ", the dhlv system seems to differ from in @xcite from the viewpoint of the position of discrete parameter @xmath85 , but they are essentially equivalent to each other .",

    "thus , it follows that @xmath120 the cases where @xmath95 and @xmath121 in become @xmath122 consequently , by combining them with and , we get @xmath123    the entries in the @xmath1th row of @xmath124 are rewritten as the linear combination @xmath125 for @xmath126 . by multiplying the @xmath101th row by @xmath127 and by adding it to the @xmath1th , we get the row @xmath128 as the new @xmath1th .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath101th , the @xmath129th , @xmath100 , the @xmath55nd rows , it follows that @xmath130 it is here worth noting that the subscript @xmath82 can be regarded as be transformed into the superscript @xmath52 .",
