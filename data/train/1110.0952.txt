    "2010 ) . in general , the strategy to probe evolutionary stages usually involves several indicators , each of which traces some star - forming activities , e.g. radio emission for ionizaiton , gas or dust temperature for internal heating , molecular linewidth for turbulence , asymmetry of line profiles for infall motions , or high - velocity gas for outflows ( e.g. crapsi et  al .",

    "since more evolved cores show smaller values of @xmath6 and @xmath20 , the plausible correlation between @xmath159 and evolutionary stage may lead to the decreasing trend of @xmath6 .",
    "most of the cores in our sample have shown outflow signatures and likely have begun to form clusters with low- and intermediate - mass protostars .",
    "this increasing degree of ionization could be arising from accretion shocks and/or heating of the gas related to the central proto - stellar / cluster objects ( stahler , shu , & taam 1980 ; hosokawa , yorke , & omukai 2010 ; calvet et  al .",
    "2004 ) . given the porous nature of the surrounding medium ( indebetouw et  al .",

    "the four quiescent cores , g34.43-mm6 , -mm9 , i18151-mm3 , i18223-mm2 , also have the lowest ionization degree , @xmath180 , among cores in same irdc . in these cores ,",
    "the degree of ionization may play a role in regulating star formation efficiency through ambipolar diffusion , in which magnetic fields drift relative to a background of neutrals ( mestel & spitzer 1956 ; shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) . in a partially ionized medium , charged particles are coupled to magnetic fields while neutrals are supported against their self - gravity through the frictional drag that they experience when drifting through ions .",
    "in addition to ambipolar diffusion , evolution of massive star - forming cores can be affected by various effects such as turbulence ( mckee & tan 2003 ) , rotation , and magnetic fields . for a more complete picture",
    ", one needs to consider all the important supports against gravity ( myers & goodman 1988 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ) . here",
    "we just make an attempt to estimate the characteristic scale for ambipolar diffusion , @xmath181 , which gives the smallest scale for which the magnetic field is well coupled to the bulk of the gas .",
    "following the picture described in mckee & ostriker ( 2007 ) and approximating the ion abundance with @xmath182 , we estimate the characteristic ambipolar diffusion scale to be @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the alfvn speed associated with the large - scale magnetic field @xmath185 and @xmath186 the ion - neutral collision rate coefficient ( draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ) . for the unknown magnetic field strength in supersonic cores , we take the median value given by mckee & ostriker ( 2007 ) ( originally from crutcher ( 1999 ) ) , @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the line width for nonthermal motions . applying the values for @xmath28 and @xmath102 in the four quiescent cores , we find the magnetic field strength to be in a range from @xmath189 to @xmath190 . the characteristic scale for ambipolar diffusion is in a range from @xmath191 to @xmath192 , much smaller than the typical size of the cores . since most star - forming cores have alfvn speeds comparable to the nonthermal component of the velocity dispersions , the turbulence in these cores should have a substantial magnetohydro - dynamic ( mhd ) component ( myers & goodman 1988 ; crutcher et  al .",
    "myers & lazarian ( 1998 ) have proposed a pressure - driven cooling flows associated with local dissipation of turbulence due to wave damping by ion - neutral friction in an inner core region . from a sufficiently turbulent outer region ,",
    "the mhd wave power transmission , @xmath193 , into a spherical inner core is described in terms of the field - neutral coupling parameter , @xmath194 , which is defined as the ratio of the core size , @xmath195 , to the minimum cutoff wavelength , @xmath196 , for the propagation of mhd waves ( myers & khersonsky 1995 ) . using the upper limits of @xmath159 in the four quiescent cores , we obtain @xmath197 with a mean value of @xmath198 , roughly in the regime of marginal field - neutral coupling ( @xmath199 for @xmath200 ; myers & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "the mhd waves excited in the outer region would have a fairly limited range of allowed wavelengths to transmit the turbulence power into the dissipating inner regions , and a pressure - driven turbulent cooling flow may occur in these cores . for comparison , bergin et  al .",

    "( 2011 ) , and miettinen et  al .",
    "an increasing trend , though with larger scatters , in @xmath6 with the co depletion factor , @xmath20 , is also found . such trend resembles the behavior of @xmath6 in the low - mass protostellar cores and suggests the use of the @xmath22 ratio as an evolutionary probe to high - mass proto - stellar / cluster candidates . 2 .   a significant enhancement of @xmath18 orders of magnitude in the @xmath22 ratio in all detected sources over the local interstellar @xmath158/[h]}$ ] ratio",
