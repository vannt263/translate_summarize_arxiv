    "honeycomb - lattice iridates of the type @xmath5iro@xmath1 ( _ _ a__=li , na ) with the effective angular momentum @xmath6 due to strong spin - orbit coupling have been under active active experimental investigation @xcite mainly because of their interesting properties associated with predicted topologically non - trivial states , including the kitaev spin - liquid state @xcite .",
    "what is more , topological superconductivity has been proposed based on the kitaev - heisenberg model with the spin _ s _ = 1/2 emerging with hole doping @xcite .",
    "another interesting compound with the honeycomb structure is li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "one of the differences from @xmath5iro@xmath1 is that li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  has nominally @xmath7 , as expected for the low - spin state of ru@xmath3(4@xmath8 ) .",
    "interestingly , li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  exhibits dimerization of ru - ru ions at @xmath9  @xmath10  k , accompanied by a sharp decrease of magnetization below @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it is found that the disorder in the ru - ru dimer configuration sensitively affects the magnetic behavior @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dimer transition has been revealed to be of the first - order type @xcite , especially in samples with more coherent dimer configuratuion with @xmath9  @xmath11  k , @xcite .",
    "it has been also demonstrated that the dimer transition is not an ordinary peierls transition . in a recent study based on a combination of high - energy x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , pair distribution function ( pdf ) analysis , and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , it has been found that the dimers dynamically survives even above @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition can be regarded as the change from a static `` dimer - solid '' state at low temperatures to a dynamic `` dimer - liquid '' state above @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the potential utility of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 as a material for batteries has motivated investigation on its electrochemical properties as well @xcite .",
    "the delithiated series li@xmath2ruo@xmath1 has been synthesized from li@xmath12ruo@xmath1 by electrochemical deintercalation of lithium @xcite and by chemical oxidation by i@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been revealed that a part of ru@xmath3  changes to ru@xmath4  by delithiation based on a sequence of experiments @xcite .",
    "however , concerning the physical properties of li@xmath2ruo@xmath1 , only magnetization has been reported in the limited temperature range between 83 and 293  k @xcite .",
    "in particular , the relation between the dimer transition and delithiation has not been reported .",
    "the effect of li deficiency on the dimer transition is of primary interest for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the hole doping by delithiation could lead to the spin @xmath13 state and thus to various topological phases including exotic superconductivity .",
    "secondly , the dimer formation may be substantially changed by li deficiency or hole doping , leading to a possible new dimer state related to dimer - solid and dimer - liquid states .    in this work ,",
    "we report properties of heavily delithiated li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  obtained by chemical oxidation .",
    "we confirm a crystallographic phase distinct from the pristine phase .",
    "this phase , emerging by heavy delithiation , shall be called the `` d - phase '' .",
    "we compare structural and magnetic properties of the d - phase with those of the stoichiometric `` s - phase '' .",
    "in particular , we find in the d - phase a new dimer - solid state with a different electronic configuration from that in the s - phase .",
    "pristine li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 samples were prepared from li@xmath0co@xmath1 ( aldrich , 99.997% ) and ruo@xmath0 ( rare metallic , 99.9% ) by means of solid - state reaction .",
    "after the starting powders were dried , stoichiometric quantities were mixed and ground for 1  h in a conventional mortar .",
    "we added acetone to improve the homogeneity of the powder @xcite .",
    "the powder was pelletized and heated at 1000@xmath14c for 24  h in the first step .",
    "next , the pellet was re - ground in acetone for 1  h , pelletized , and heated at 900@xmath14c for 48  h followed by natural cooling .",
    "this choice of the synthesis proccedure is based on the previous study @xcite .",
    "purity , as well as the coherence of the dimer configuration were verified by xrd and magnetic susceptibility measurements as described below .",
    "the delithiation was performed based on the reaction : @xmath15{\\text{ch}_3\\text{cn } }   \\text{li}_{2-x}\\text{ruo}_3 + x \\text{lii } + \\frac{y - x}{2 } \\text{i}_2   \\label{ch : delithiation}\\ ] ]    i@xmath0 ( wako , 99.9% ) was dissolved in acetonitrile ( ch@xmath1cn ) with the concentration of 0.3384 mol / l .",
    "after precise measurement of its mass , the powder of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 was soaked in the iodine solution for 3 days at room temperature .",
    "then the li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  powder was washed with clean acetonitrile . since xrd analysis indicated that stronger delithiation was necessary , after another measurement of the mass , the powder was soaked in a new solution of i@xmath0 0.3683",

    "the containers were covered with aluminum foil in order to avoid the conversion of i@xmath16 into i@xmath0 triggered by light .",

    "a less - delithiated sample of li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  was prepared in a solution of i@xmath0  0.18457  mol / l . in this case , a pellet of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  was soaked for 3 days .",
    "we stored samples in vacuum although there is no noticeable decomposition at room temperature in air for both pristine and delithiaed samples .    in order to evaluate the value of _ x",
    "_ , the remaining quantity of i@xmath0 in acetonitrile was measured through titration @xcite with a standard solution of na@xmath0s@xmath0o@xmath1 ( wako , 0.05 mol / l for volumetric analysis ) at 19  based on the reaction : @xmath17 the glassware used for the titration was calibrated at 19  with acetonitrile .",
    "the completion of this reaction is monitored by the color of starch added in the solution .",
    "we find that the total lithium extracted is @xmath18 and 0.34 for the two delithiated samples presented in this paper .",
    "we also performed the inductively - coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy ( icp - oes ) analysis using a commercial apparatus ( seiko instruments , sps 6100 ) .",
    "quantitative evaluation of _ x _ by icp - oes was not successful because li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  can not be dissolved completely into standard acids ( such as hcl ) , due to production of insoluble ruo@xmath0  in the acid .",
    "the laboratory xrd measurements were carried out with a commercial diffractometer ( bruker , d8 advance ) using the cu@xmath19 radiation ( @xmath20   , @xmath21  kev ) equipped with a one - dimensional array of detectors and a nickel monochromator .",
    "high - energy xrd measurements at room temperature were performed at the beam line id22 of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) .",

    "high - energy xrd measurements at various elevated temperatures were performed at the beam line id11 at esrf .",
    "a double laue monochromator was used to select x - ray of the energy of 87.5  kev ( @xmath23   ) .",
    "the beam was focused to ca .",
    "100 mm using refractive lenses .",
    "the scattered x - ray was detected using a ccd camera ( frelon ) .",
    "temperature control was achieved using a hot - air blower .",
    "data were continuously collected upon heating to 723  k at 2.5  k / min , and upon cooling to room temperature at the same rate .",
    "typical temperature resolution was 0.2  k / pattern .",
    "we find a noticeable difference between the actual sample temperature and the thermometer temperature .",
    "thus , a lineal correction to the thermometer temperature was made , so that @xmath9  of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  recorded in the xrd measurement matches with the @xmath9  of the magnetization measurements .",
    "the magnetization measurements were performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms ) .",
    "the magnetization at high temperatures ( 300 to 700  k ) were measured using the oven option for mpms .",
    "we used quartz tubes as sample holders for the high temperature measurements .",
    "the sample tubes were sealed with ceramic bond ( resbond , 907gf ) in order to prevent any gas released from the sample to damage the inside of the oven sample space .",
    "we checked the thermometer calibration of the oven by measuring the ferromagnetic transition ( @xmath24= 627.2  k ) of ni ( rare metallic , 99.99% ) at several fields @xcite .",
    "the calibration error in @xmath25 of ni is less than 0.2% .",

    "the delithiated samples exhibit patterns with substantial differences compared with the @xmath26 sample as described below .",
    "the @xmath34 sample , exhibiting almost single - phase behavior , has the ( _ _ h__00 ) and ( 00__l _ _ ) peaks shifted to lower angles and the ( 0__k__0 ) peaks shifted to higher angles ( fig.[fig : xrd_he](c ) ) , indicating increase in the values of _ a _ and _ c _ and decrease in the value of _ b _ [ fig.[fig : mtlow](c ) ] .",
    "nevertheless , the spectrum of this delithiathed sample can be well fitted also with the sg @xmath33/_m _  [ fig  [ fig : rietveld](b ) ] .",
    "we designate the crystallographic phase observed in the @xmath34 sample as the d - phase .",
    "in addition to the main peaks associated with the d - phase , we can identify minor phases such as the s - phase li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , ruo@xmath0 , and yet another delithiated phase li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  with @xmath35 ( sg @xmath36 , no .",
    "148 ) @xcite .    for the sample with @xmath37 , we find that the xrd peaks such as ( 001 ) and ( 020 ) are clearly split into two peaks [ fig.[fig : xrd_he](c ) ] : one group similar to those of the @xmath26 sample and the other similar to those of the @xmath34 sample .",
    "this fact indicates that the crystal - structure change due to delithiation is not continuous : there are two crystallographically distinct phases with @xmath26 and @xmath38 and they coexist in similar ratio in the @xmath39 sample .",
    "in addition to the shifts in the main peaks , three small peaks but sharp peaks are observed in the delithiated samples at @xmath40 [ _ d _ = 7.30 , 6.18 , and 5.71  , fig.[fig : xrd_he](b ) ] , indicating the presence of a superlattice structure .",
    "although these small peaks have not been reported in pristine or delithiated li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , a superlattice in li@xmath2ru@xmath41o@xmath1 ( @xmath42mn , sn ) has been recently found as additional spots in electron diffraction @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the structure has approximately been described with the sg @xmath43  ( neglecting the presence of the superlattice and ru - ru dimers even for small values of _ y _ ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the origin of the superlattice is the distortion in the oxygen positions @xcite .",
    "another possibility is an ordering of ru valency ( charge order ) as we discuss latter .",
    "since the sg in li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  with the superlattice taken into account is not trivial , we hereafter consider the sg @xmath33/_m _  to evaluate the cell parameters and the ru ion positions .",

    "+    we performed a curie - weiss fitting to the susceptibility at low temperatures .",
    "the fitting temperature ranges ( shown in table [ tb : c - w ] ) are chosen so that the positive slope in @xmath45 associated with the dimer transition at @xmath9  does not affect the fittings .",

    "it is important to note that the obtained number of nondimerized ions in the @xmath18 sample is much smaller than the number of vacancies of lithium , or equivalently the number of ru@xmath4  ions .",

    "magnetic susceptibility vs temperature of ( a ) li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  and ( b ) li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  ( @xmath18 ) from 1.8 to 45  k at different magnetic fields measured in zfc ( closed symbols ) and fc ( open symbols ) processes.,width=321 ]    figures  [ fig : mtlow](a ) and ( b ) compare the low - temperature susceptibilities for the @xmath26 and @xmath18 samples .",
    "it is noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtlow](b ) that the sample with @xmath18 at low fields exhibits magnetic hysteresis below 12  k. since the weiss temperature @xmath47 is negative , this hysteresis is probably due to magnetic ordering with antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "no trace of superconductivity was found by ac susceptibility measurements using an adibatic demagnetization refrigerator @xcite or transport measurements down to 0.1  k.      according to the outcome of the last section , the d - phase is dominated by ru - ru dimers . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the electronic configuration of these dimers and their correlation with the crystalline structure .",
    "we first discuss the probable valency of ru ions in the d - phase .",
    "it has been demonstrated by x - ray photoemission spectroscopy , mssbauer spectroscopy , electronic paramagnetic resonance measurements , and dft calculations , that the deintercalation of lithium from li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  leads to the valence change from ru@xmath3  to ru@xmath4 . in higher _ x _ range than @xmath54 , where ru ions are fully oxidized to pentavalent , it is revealed that further delithiation induces loss of oxygen , presence of peroxides ( o@xmath55 ) , and oxidation of ru@xmath4  into ru@xmath56 ions @xcite .",
    "thus , in the sample of the present study with @xmath57 , the ratio of the amount of ru@xmath4  among the total ru ions would be similar to this _ x _ value and the others remain ru@xmath3 .",
    "in other words the valency of the sample can be approximately expressed as .     molecular orbital diagrams of possible configurations of the dimers of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  ( s - phase ) and li@xmath2ruo@xmath1  ( d - phase ) .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) depict the molecular orbitals in the dimer - solid state consisting of ru@xmath3ru@xmath3 , ru@xmath4ru@xmath4 , and ru@xmath3ru@xmath4 dimers , respectively .",
    "configuration in the panel ( c ) is less likely to occur based on the observed magnetic susceptibility .",
    "panel ( d ) depicts the molecular orbitals in the dimer - liquid state formed by ru@xmath3ru@xmath3 ions proposed in ref .",
    "_ b _ is the bond order defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bon_ord]).,width=226 ]    for the s - phase , it is expected that the magnetization is governed by the ru@xmath3  ( 4@xmath58 ) ion .",
    "the origin of the decrease of the magnetization below @xmath9  has been attributed to the formation of dimers with molecular orbitals ( mos ) with _ s _  @xmath59  0   @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the greater magnetization above @xmath9  has been explained by the partial breakdown of mos . in the dimer - liquid state above @xmath9 ,",
    "the ru  4__d _ _ orbitals keep the mo formed only by the @xmath60 , leading to dynamic dimers  @xcite .",
    "since the curie - weiss analysis indicates that most of the ru ions form dimers with @xmath61 even in li@xmath2ruo@xmath1 , there are three possible electronic configurations of the dimers in the dimer - solid state as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mo ] .",
    "the configuration in panel ( a ) is what already proposed for the s - phase ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we propose that in the d - phase the most probable configuration for ru@xmath4  is the dimer formed between ru@xmath4  and ru@xmath4  [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mo](b ) ] , since such a dimer has electrons only in the lower - energy bonding states .",
    "in contrast , the dimers formed between ru@xmath3  and ru@xmath3  ions or ru@xmath3and ru@xmath4  ions [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mo](a , c ) ] contain electrons also in higher - energy antibonding states .",
    "actually , the amount of dimers with the configuration ru@xmath4-ru@xmath3  accompanied by spin @xmath13 must be quite small based on the observed small curie constant .",
    "the situation that most of the ru ions form isovalent - spinless dimers is actually difficult to be realized if ru@xmath4  and ru@xmath3  ions distribute randomly .",
    "thus , the ru ions in the d - phase may exhibit charge ordering between ru@xmath3  and ru@xmath4ions .",
    "such charge ordering may be the origin of the observed superlattice .",
    "since ru@xmath3ru@xmath3  dimers contain a mo with higher energy than those of ru@xmath4ru@xmath4  dimers i.e. @xmath62 , it is more likely that the @xmath62 of the ru@xmath3ru@xmath3  dimers breaks at lower temperature than mos of ru@xmath4ru@xmath4[fig.[fig : mo](b ) ] . the @xmath9  where mos of li@xmath0ruo@xmath1  break has been demonstrated to depend on the dimer coherence configuration @xcite .",
    "thus , similar to the s - phase , the enhancement of magnetization in the d - phase at @xmath63  k ( fig .",
    "[ sec : magnetization ] ) is probably related to the breaking of mos of the ru@xmath3ru@xmath3  dimers .    in the context of the linear combination of atomic orbitals ,",
    "the bond lengths _ l _ of different dimer configurations can be estimated in terms of the quantity called the bond order _",

    "[ fig : mo ] the values of _ b _ of the possible electronic configurations are shown .",
    "pauling found an empirical relation between _ b _ and the bond length @xmath67 @xcite : @xmath68 where the value of _ f _ depends on the atoms and @xmath69 is the bond length for @xmath70 . later this relation was derived from the friedel model @xcite . in order to evaluate the constant",
    "_ f _ , we use the value of the bond length of the dimer - liquid state of the s - phase ( @xmath71   )  @xcite , where only the @xmath72-mo is occupied i.e. @xmath70 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mo](d ) ] .",
    "we also use the bond lengths of the short bond in the dimer - solid state of the s - phase ( @xmath73   ) where the @xmath74 mos are occupied i.e. @xmath75 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mo](a ) ] . from these values , we obtain @xmath76   . by using these values we estimate the length of the ru@xmath4ru@xmath4  bond in the dimer - solid state to be @xmath77   .",
    "since in the dimer - solid state of the @xmath18 sample , around 73% of the dimers are formed by ru@xmath4ru@xmath4  ions and the rest by by ru@xmath3ru@xmath3ions , the average length of the short bonds is expected to be 2.56    if we assume that the dimers are all located in the @xmath78 bonds .",
    "this is 0.04    shorter than the dimer entirely formed between ru@xmath3and ru@xmath3  ions in the s - phase . on the other hand , the observations for the sum of the bond lengths ( @xmath79 ) of the d - phase ( @xmath808.592   )",
    "is 0.074    shorter than that of the s - phase ( @xmath808.666   ) .",
    "the excess of shrinkage of @xmath81 maybe due to the difference in ionic size between ru@xmath3  ( @xmath82   ) and ru@xmath4  ( @xmath83   ) @xcite in the nondimer bonds , although covalency needs to be considered .",
    "the reduced difference between short and long bonds in the d - phase suggests that some dimers are distributed in @xmath84 and @xmath85 as well .",
    "we successfully synthesized the delithiated phase li@xmath2ruo@xmath1 , the d - phase , with structures distinct from the stoichiometric li@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the s - phase .",
    "for the first time , we identify the magnetic properties of the d - phase .",
    "we found that the ru ions also form dimers as in the s - phase .",
    "there should be two kinds of dimers in the d - phase : ru@xmath3ru@xmath3  dimers as in the s - phase and additional ru@xmath4ru@xmath4  dimers .",
    "the latter should have a new molecular orbital configuration , in which no electrons occupy antibonding states .",
    "we find that above @xmath86  k the d - phase exhibits a strong linear increase in the susceptibility . in analogy to the s - phase ,",
    "this magnetic feature is most likely associated with the change from the dimer - solid to dimer - liquid states .",
    "structural and magnetic properties indicate that the dimers in the dimer - solid state are located not only in the @xmath78 bonds but also in the @xmath84 and @xmath85 bonds .",
