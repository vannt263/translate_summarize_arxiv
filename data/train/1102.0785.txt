    "although the quark model exhibits a @xmath3 chiral symmetry in the limit of massless up , down and strange quarks , and in principle 9 massless goldstone modes are expected to appear when this symmetry is broken , only 8 light pseudoscalar mesons are observed experimentally .",
    "this puzzling mystery is resolved by the adler - bell - jackiw @xmath1 anomaly : instantons tunneling between topologically different qcd vacuum states explicitely break the @xmath1 part of the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "thus the 9th goldstone boson is expected to be massive , and is associated with the @xmath0 meson , which has a mass of 958 mev , approximately twice that of the other pseudoscalar mesons .    in high energy",
    "heavy ion collisions at rhic , a hot and dense medium is created .",
    "recent measurements of the direct photon spectrum in @xmath4 = 200 gev au+au collisions indicate  @xcite , that the initial temperature in these reactions is at least 300 mev , while hadrons as we know them may not exist above the hagedorn temperature of @xmath5 mev  @xcite .",
    "thus the matter created in heavy ion collisions at rhic is hot enough to be a quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of the properties of this matter indicate that it flows like a perfect fluid  @xcite , and scaling properties of the elliptic flow indicate scaling with the number of constituent quarks  @xcite , hence this matter is sometimes referred to as a strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp )  @xcite , or , in more direct terms , a perfect fluid of quarks  @xcite .    after this perfect fluid of quarks rehadronizes , a hot and dense hadronic matter",
    "may be created , where the @xmath1 symmetry of the strong interactions may temporarily be restored @xcite .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculations indicate that such chirally symmetric but hadronic matter may exist below the critical temperature for quark deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "in such a medium , the mass of the @xmath6 mesons may be reduced to its quark model value of about 500 mev , corresponding to the return of the  prodigal \" 9th goldstone boson  @xcite . in this presentation",
    "we summarize the the results on an indirect observation of such an in - medium @xmath0 mass modification based on a detailed analysis of phenix and star charged pion bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) data  @xcite .",
    "these results have been published recently in refs .",
    "@xcite and detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite ,    r0.49     the abundance of the @xmath0 mesons with reduced mass may be increased at low @xmath7 , by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "one should emphasize that the @xmath0 ( and @xmath8 ) mesons almost always decay after the surrounding hadronic matter has frozen out , due to their small annihilation and scattering cross sections , and their decay times that are much longer than the characteristic 5 - 10 fm / c decoupling times of the fireball created in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "therefore one can not expect a direct observation of the mass shift of the @xmath0 ( or @xmath8 ) mesons : all detection possibilities of their in - medium mass modification have to rely on their enhanced production .",
    "an enhancement of low transverse momentum @xmath0 mesons contributes to an enhanced production of soft charged pions mainly through the @xmath9 decay chain and also through other , less prominent channels . as the @xmath0 decays far away from the fireball",
    ", the enhanced production of pions in the corresponding halo region will reduce the strength of the bose - einstein correlation between soft charged pions .",
    "the transverse mass ( @xmath10 ) dependence of the extrapolated intercept parameter @xmath11 of the charged pion bose - einstein correlations was shown to be an observable that is sensitive to such an enhanced @xmath0 multiplicity , as pointed our first in ref .",
    "@xcite and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the predicted drop of @xmath12 data at low transverse masses has been observed both by phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite at rhic , as it is indicated on fig .",
    "[ f : datasets ] .",
    "note that this reduction is not present in the s+pb data set at cern sps at @xmath4 = 19.4 gev energy  @xcite .",
    "our main analysis tool was a monte - carlo simulation of the transverse mass dependence of the long lived resonance multiplicities including the possibility of an enhanced @xmath0 production at low transverse momentum , due to a partial in - medium @xmath1 restoration and a related @xmath0 mass modification .",
    "this model and the related reduction of the effective intercept parameter of the two - pion bose - einstein correlation function was proposed first in ref .",
    "@xcite and detailed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in thermal models ,",
    "the production cross sections of the light mesons are exponentially suppressed by the mass .",
    "hence one expects about two orders of magnitude less @xmath0 mesons from the freeze - out than pions .",
    "this suppression , however , may be moderated as a consequence of a possible @xmath0 mass reduction , and the @xmath0 mesons may show up in an enhanced number .",
    "the number of in - medium @xmath0 mesons is calculated with an improved hagedorn formula yielding the following @xmath0 enhancement factor : @xmath13 this formula includes a prefactor with an expansion dynamics dependent exponent @xmath14 for an expansion in @xmath15 effective dimensions  @xcite . as a default value",
    ", @xmath16 was taken  @xcite and , for the systematic investigations , this parameter was varied between @xmath17 .",
    "other model parameters and their investigated ranges are described as follows : @xmath18 in the above formula corresponds to the temperature of the medium when the in - medium modified @xmath0 mesons are formed ; its default value was taken to be @xmath19 mev  @xcite and varied systematically between 140 and 220 mev .",
    "resonances with different masses were simulated with a mass dependent slope parameter @xmath20 , where the default values of @xmath21 mev and @xmath22  @xcite were utilized and systematically varied in the range of 100 mev @xmath23 177 mev and 0.40 @xmath24 0.60  .",
    "once produced , the @xmath0 is expected to be decoupled from other hadronic matter , since its annihilation and scattering cross sections are very small  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0 mass is reduced in the medium , the observed @xmath0 spectrum will consist of two components .",
    "if the @xmath7 of the @xmath0 is large enough , it can get on - shell and escape .",
    "this will produce a thermal component of the spectrum .",

    "is dissolved , the effect of qcd instantons increases and the trapped @xmath0 mesons regain their free mass and appear at low @xmath7 .",
    "the low @xmath7 enhancement of the @xmath0 meson also affects the spectrum of its decay products , first of all the @xmath8 , the feed - down to which can be described with an @xmath0 to @xmath8 branching ratio of @xmath27 .",

    "@xcite , we improved on earlier simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , that considered the trapped @xmath0 mesons to leave the dissolving medium with a negligible @xmath7 . that earlier approach resulted in a steep hole in the extrapolated intercept parameter @xmath12 at a characteristic transverse mass of @xmath33  @xcite . in that simplified scenario",
    "the only free parameter was the in - medium @xmath0 mass , determining the depth of the observed hole .",
    "in our recent analysis  @xcite , the @xmath0-s from the decaying condensate were given a random transverse momentum , following maxwell - boltzmann statistics with an inverse slope parameter @xmath34 , which was necessary to obtain a quality description of the width and the slope of the @xmath12 data of phenix and star in the @xmath35 mev region .",
    "physically , @xmath34 is limited by @xmath36 , so the trapped @xmath0 -s may gain only moderate transverse momenta .",
