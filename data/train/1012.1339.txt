    "the characterization of the flavor conversions for neutrinos emitted by a stellar collapse is a field of intense activity . in particular ,",
    "the flavor transformation probabilities in supernovae ( sne ) not only depend on the matter background  @xcite , but also on the neutrino fluxes themselves : neutrino - neutrino interactions provide a nonlinear term in the equations of motion  @xcite that causes collective flavor transformations  .",
    "only recently  @xcite it has been fully appreciated that in the sn context these collective effects give rise to qualitatively new phenomena ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the main consequence of this unusual type of flavor transitions is an exchange of the spectrum of the electron species @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with the non - electron ones @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) in certain energy intervals .",
    "these flavor exchanges are called `` swaps '' marked by the `` splits '' , which are the boundary features at the edges of each swap interval  @xcite . the location and the number of these splits , as well as",
    "their dependence on the neutrino mass hierarchy , is crucially dependent on the flux ordering among different neutrino species  @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "one of the main complication in the simulation of the flavor evolution is that the flux of neutrinos emitted from a supernova core is far from isotropic .",
    "the current - current nature of the weak - interaction hamiltonian implies that the interaction energy between neutrinos of momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the neutrino velocity  @xcite . in a non - isotropic medium",
    "this velocity - dependent term would not average to zero , producing a different refractive index for neutrinos propagating on different trajectories .",
    "this is the origin of the so - called `` multi - angle effects ''  @xcite , which hinder the maintenance of the coherent oscillation behavior for different neutrino modes  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it has been shown that in a dense neutrino gas initially composed of only @xmath2 and @xmath10 with equal fluxes , multi - angles effects would rapidly lead to flavor decoherence , resulting in flux equilibration among electron and non - electron ( anti)neutrino species .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of relevant flavor asymmetries between @xmath2 and @xmath11 multi - angle effects can be suppressed . in particular , during the early sn accretion phase , one expects as neutrino flux ordering @xmath12  @xcite , defined in terms of the total neutrino number fluxes @xmath13 for the different flavors .",
    "this case would practically correspond to neutrino spectra with a _",
    "single crossing _",
    "point at @xmath14 ( where @xmath0 , and @xmath1 ) since @xmath15 for all the relevant energies ( and analogously for @xmath16 ) .",
    "for spectra with a single crossing , it has been shown in  @xcite that the presence of significant flavor asymmetries between @xmath2 and @xmath10 fluxes guarantees the synchronization of different angular modes at low - radii ( @xmath17  km ) , so that essentially nothing happens close to the neutrinosphere because the in - medium mixing is extremely small .",
    "therefore , the possible onset of multi - angle effects is delayed after the synchronization phase . then , the flavor evolution is adiabatic to produce spectral splits and swaps but not enough to allow the multi - angle instability to grow and produce significant decoherence effects . therefore , the resultant neutrino flavor conversions would be described by an effective `` quasi single - angle '' behavior . in this case",
    ", the self - induced spectral swaps and splits would be only marginal smeared by multi - angle effects , as explicitly shown in  @xcite .",

    "points , i.e. with @xmath15 at lower energies , and @xmath19 at higher energies ( and analogously for @xmath16 ) . for such spectra",
    ", it has been shown in  @xcite that the synchronization is not a stable solution for a neutrino gas in presence of a large neutrino density .",
    "therefore , collective flavor conversions would be possible at low - radii in the single - angle scheme  @xcite , in a region where one would have naively expected synchronization .",
    "however , it has been shown in  @xcite that the presence of a large dispersion in the neutrino - neutrino refractive index , induced by multi - angle effects , seems to block the development of these collective flavor conversions close to the neutrinosphere .",
    "this recent result extends the finding obtained with a toy model in  @xcite .",
    "the delay of the self - induced flavor conversions for this case is also visible in the multi - angle simulations in  @xcite .",
    "so , it is apparent that multi - angle effects are relevant not only for fluxes with small flavor asymmetries , where they trigger a quick flavor _ decoherence _ , but also in cases of spectra with multiple crossing points , where multi - angle effects can _ suppress _ flavor conversions at low - radii .    triggered by the contrasting impact of the multi - angle effects for fluxes typical of the accretion and cooling phase ,",

    "the total density matrix @xmath138 continues to behave as a collective object , but is not static and vibrates itself with a frequency @xmath174 .",
    "for single - crossed spectra , the energy conservation prevents any seizable change in the different @xmath137 , therefore the synchronized behavior prevails .",
    "conversely , in presence of multiple - crossed neutrino spectra , the different @xmath150 s do not remain aligned with the global @xmath176 and start to librate relative to each other .",
    "we also note that in this case three - flavor effects , associated with @xmath70 are present .",
    "in particular , from the figure , one realizes that collective librations first start in the @xmath69 system ( at @xmath172  km ) , and then trigger the @xmath71 conversions ( at @xmath177  km ) .",
    "the explanation of this dynamics has been recently given in  @xcite , where we redirect the interested reader .",
    "passing to the multi - angle case of fig .  8",
    ", we find that now the low - radii flavor conversions are suppressed .",
    "this effect has been recently described in  @xcite , even if there it has not made the connection between this behavior and the multi - angle suppression of the parametric resonance .",
    "this effect has been pointed out in  @xcite for generic neutrino gases with half - isotropic neutrino distributions , in cases where in the single - angle scheme the parametric resonance was found .",
    "the point is that in the multi - angle case , for large @xmath174 the different @xmath137 s would precess with different velocities whose spread , due to multi - angle effects , is much larger than @xmath82 . as a consequence of this dispersion , there can not exist a collective parametric resonance for all the neutrino modes .",
    "therefore , the collective behavior found in the idealized single - angle case is `` fragile '' and easily suppressed by multi - angle effects in the realistic anisotropic supernova environment . in this case , as long as multi - angle effects are dominant , they would suppress any flavor conversion at small radii . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the role of multi - angle effects in this case is analogous to the one that they have in presence of a large matter term ( @xmath178 )  @xcite .",

    "neutrino modes would remain frozen to their initial condition , till the neutrino - neutrino interaction @xmath174 becomes comparable with the averaged vacuum oscillation frequency of the neutrino ensemble  @xcite @xmath179 where for our input spectra @xmath180    and    @xmath181    which numerically leads to @xmath182  km@xmath152 .",

    "the flux differences are smaller than in the previous example of sec .",

    "we stress that the adiabaticity plays a crucial role in determining the impact of the multi - angle suppression in the flavor evolution .",

    "we have shown that this multi - angle delay can produce dramatic changes , not only in the deepest supernova regions , as shown in  @xcite , but also in the final oscillated neutrino spectra .",
    "in particular , the multi - angle suppression can be so strong to allow the onset of the flavor evolution only at a large radius , when the evolution is less adiabatic .",
    "depending on the violation of adiabaticity , in the inverted mass hierarchy there could be a suppression of the three - flavor effects , associated to the solar sector .",

    "i we summarize our results on the role of multi - angle effects , @xmath203 effects and spectral splits for different sn neutrino fluxes . in this work we have explicitly shown numerical results only for the case of neutrino inverted mass hierarchy . however , we have checked that the impact of multi - angle effects is qualitatively similar also for the normal hierarchy case .    from our numerical explorations",

    "on which was based the original picture of the collective supernova neutrino conversions : low - radii synchronization , subleading role of multi - angle and three - flavor effects .",
    "the discovery of these new effects adds additional layers of complications in the simulation of the flavor evolution for supernova neutrinos . in particular , our result shows that during the cooling phase three - flavor multi - angle simulations are crucial to obtain a correct result .",
    "multi - angle effects would be taken into account to assess the impact of collective neutrino oscillations on the r - process nucleosynthesis in supernovae , as recently investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the impact of the multi - angle effects would crucially depend on different sn input : neutrino luminosities and flavor asymmetries , neutrinosphere radius , etc .",
    "since all these quantities significantly change during the neutrino emission , one would expect time - dependent effects . at this regard ,",
    "the possibility to detect signatures of these effects in the next galactic supernova neutrino burst  @xcite would motivate further analytical and numerical investigations .",

    "<S> we investigate the dependence of these  multi - angle effects \" on the original sn neutrino fluxes in a three - flavor framework . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the pattern of the spectral crossings ( energies where @xmath0 , and @xmath1 ) is crucial in determining the impact of multi - angle effects on the flavor evolution </S>",
    "<S> . for neutrino spectra presenting only a single - crossing , synchronization of different angular modes prevails over multi - angle effects , producing the known `` quasi single - angle '' evolution . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in the presence of spectra with multiple crossing energies , synchronization is not stable . in this situation </S>",
    "<S> , multi - angle effects would produce a sizable delay in the onset of the flavor conversions , as recently observed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , due to the only partial adiabaticity of the evolution at large radii , the multi - angle suppression can be so strong to dramatically affect the final oscillated neutrino spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in particular three - flavor effects , associated with the solar parameters , could be washed - out in multi - angle simulations . </S>"
