    "in an analytic approach @xcite , we have recently described the spectrum of light scattered by a three - level lambda - type system under two conditions .",
    "one condition was that the incident - light frequency was much lower than the separation frequencies between the states situated in the ends of the arms of lambda configuration ( figure [ fig : lambda ] ) .",
    "thus , the transitions in the arms had multiphoton character .",
    "the other condition was that of weak depopulation of the initial state placed at the bottom of one arm ( the black dot in figure  [ fig : lambda ] ) .",
    "as long as the latter condition was fulfilled , our analytic approach succeeded in explaining all details of the spectra found by numerical integration of the schrdinger equation ( number of peaks , their internal structures , positions , relative heights and sensitivity to the light - pulse shape and strength ) .",
    "taking the wavefunction of the system as @xmath0 , the basis of our approach in @xcite was a set of two coupled nonlinear equations for the ratios @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the schrdinger population amplitudes @xmath3 .",
    "this set , found as    [ eq : ric ] @xmath4    with the parameters in it clarified in figure [ fig : lambda ] , was analytically solved for the case of weak depletion of the initial state , i.e. , under the condition @xmath5 . under this condition , we first dropped the term @xmath6 in equation  ( [ eq : ric1 ] ) , making this equation a quadratically nonlinear riccati - type equation known from the two - level problem @xcite . next",
    ", the riccati equation for @xmath7 was solved in the zero - order approximation by neglecting the term quadratic in @xmath7 . a better solution to the riccati equation for @xmath7 , describing approximately the effect of nonlinearity in @xmath7 , was then found in a perturbative way and this solution was substituted to equation  ( [ eq : ric2 ] ) . at a given @xmath7 , equation  ( [ eq : ric2 ] ) is a nonhomogeneous linear first - order differential equation with known formal solution @xcite .",
    "now we extend our approach @xcite to cover the case of significant depopulation of the initial state , particularly the spectacular case when the population is periodically exchanged between the two lower states lying in the bottoms of lambda , leaving the highest state practically unpopulated .",
    "such a population exchange between states 1 and 3 was , in fact , obtained in the numerical calculations reported by both us ( figure  2(c ) in @xcite and the corresponding text ) and caldara and fiordilino ( figure  2(b ) in @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , an effective exchange between the mentioned states occurred when these states were separated by nearly the energy of two photons .",
    "this case of the two - photon separation of the lower states is the very one we focus our attention on throughout this paper . in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the case to be considered means that @xmath7 is still small ( @xmath9 ) but @xmath8 can be large .     and @xmath10 much higher than the laser frequency @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the instantaneous rabi frequencies for the electric - dipole 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 couplings , respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in figure  [ fig : lambda ] , we sketch the system under study .",
    "the initial state of the system has its eigenfrequency @xmath14 .",
    "the parity @xmath15 of the 1st state differs from that of the 2nd state and is the same as that of the 3rd state so the only non - zero dipole matrix elements in the system are @xmath16 and @xmath17 . instead of applying the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 as in @xcite , we now prefer to work with the equations for the population amplitudes @xmath3 @xcite :    [ eq : set1 ] @xmath18    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the instantaneous rabi frequencies for the electric - dipole @xmath19 and @xmath20 couplings , respectively , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the eigenfrequencies of the other states .",
    "precisely , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a slowly varying pulse shape function and @xmath26 refers to the laser - field oscillations as fast as the optical frequency @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the familiar time - independent one - photon rabi frequencies with @xmath30 being the peak electric - field strength .    under the conditions",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 , we shall first reduce equations  ( [ eq : set1 ] ) to an effective two - state set . since the numerical calculations @xcite pointed to negligible population of level 2 when one meets nearly two - photon resonance between states 1 and 3 , we approximately eliminate @xmath33 from the set ( equations  ( [ eq : set1 ] ) ) .",
    "first , we formally integrate equation  ( [ eq : b2 ] ) in the range @xmath34 . since this equation alone is a nonhomogeneous linear in @xmath33 first - order differential equation ,",
    "its formal solution is @xcite @xmath35 we know that @xmath36 and that ( since @xmath31 ) these instantaneous rabi frequencies oscillate slowly in time with respect to the function @xmath37 .",
    "however , we a priori assume that the amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 also change slowly in time as compared to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the solutions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , if found under this adiabatic assumption , will have a limited range of applicability .",
    "this range will be defined later on . with this adiabatic assumption ,",
    "the leading term in equation  ( [ eq : solb2 ] ) is @xmath40 this @xmath41 , when substituted to equations  ( [ eq : b1 ] ) and ( [ eq : b3 ] ) , gives a pair of equations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 :    [ eq : set2 ] @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . above ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the instantaneous stark shifts of states 1 and 3 caused by direct coupling of these states to state 2 , while @xmath47 looks like an effective time - dependent coupling between states 1 and 3 through the intermediate state 2 . substituting @xmath48 and @xmath49",

    "is then reduced to a single equation for this variable , namely the riccati - type equation @xmath58 this equation has structurally the same form ( but different @xmath59 ) as the one met in the problem of a 2-level system @xcite .",
    "the corresponding two - level system equation reads @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in terms of the present @xmath63 and @xmath59 one obtains from equations  ( [ eq : set3 ] ) the required amplitudes :    [ eq : bric ] @xmath64\\,,\\\\ b_3(t ) & = & x\\,\\exp\\left[i\\left(\\int_0^t s(t^ { ' } ) x(t^ { ' } ) { \\mathrm{d}}t^{'}-\\phi(t)\\right)\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , using the fourier - bessel expansion to the term @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 and also the relation @xmath67 satisfied by the bessel functions @xmath68 we write the present @xmath59 defined by equation  ( [ eq : fulls ] ) as @xmath69}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}s_n(t)e^{-i[(\\omega_{31}-2n\\omega_0)t+\\delta_t]}\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this @xmath59 was derived taking fast oscillations of the electric field in the optical pulse in the form of @xmath26 . for",
    "the @xmath70 oscillations one should replace @xmath71 by @xmath72 in equation  ( [ eq : sapp1 ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : fulls ] ) and ( [ eq : sapp1 ] ) for @xmath59 show a great role played by the term @xmath73 in the phase @xmath55 . first of all , it is a term allowing higher - order even - photon @xmath74 resonances in the system , i.e. , higher than two - photon resonance .",
    "moreover , this term introduces a complex field dependence to a fixed resonance because , due to this term , the field appears in the argument of the bessel functions . in section iii ,",
    "more details will be given on the role of this term in the phase @xmath55 .",
    "the key riccati equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) is seen to play a crucial role in the above presentation .",
    "obviously , it also results from equations  ( [ eq : ric ] ) for the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 . to show this",
    ", we first neglect the term quadratic in @xmath7 in equation  ( [ eq : ric1 ] ) when considering the case of weak population of state 2 .",
    "then , the simplified equation  ( [ eq : ric1 ] ) is solved in the adiabatic approximation with the result @xmath75 analogous to equation  ( [ eq : apb2 ] ) . substituting this @xmath7 to equation  ( [ eq : ric2 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath76 gives the riccati equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) .",
    "in @xcite , an analytic solution to the riccati equation like equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) was given but for the case of weak depopulation of the initial state 1 .",
    "that solution is not valid for the present case because now the initial - state population can completely be moved to the third state under the condition of two - photon @xmath74 resonance .",
    "the strong pumping of state 3 means intermediate and large values of @xmath77 and , thus , the dominant role of the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) . on the other hand , the second term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] )",
    "is expected to be non - negligible in the opposite limit of weak pumping of state 3 , i.e. , when @xmath77 is small .",
    "mathematically , if @xmath78 is the solution of the reduced equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 solves the other reduced equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) , @xmath81 , then @xmath82 is an approximate solution of the complete riccati equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) under the condition @xmath83 , where @xmath84 . substituting the above @xmath85 to equations  ( [ eq : bric ] ) results in    [ eq : bric2 ] @xmath86    where @xmath87 $ ] . in the following",
    ", we shall consider a special form of these amplitudes .",
    "let us assume that the pulse envelope function @xmath25 rises from 0 to 1 in a short few - cycle time @xmath88 and then keeps constant value @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "thus , for the rising time much shorter than the pulse length , we roughly approximate @xmath91 . as a consequence , when the dynamic even - photon @xmath74 resonance takes place ( @xmath92 , where @xmath93 if @xmath94 ; @xmath95 is negative if @xmath96 ) , @xmath59 of equation  ( [ eq : sapp1 ] ) splits into its slowly and rapidly varying in time parts .",
    "the slow resonance part is that with @xmath97 only ,    @xmath98    while the rest in @xmath59 is the other part .",
    "this slow part will give dominant contribution to the integral @xmath99 rooted as the argument in the trigonometric functions in equations  ( [ eq : bric2 ] ) .",
    "thus , in analogy to the standard one - photon rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite , we now make generalized rotating - wave approximation ( grwa @xcite ) in the case of a given even - photon @xmath74 resonance , i.e , neglect the rapidly oscillating terms in @xmath59 . in grwa , @xmath100 and is thus real entailing @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the last @xmath63 is seen to be the exact solution of the riccati equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) in its grwa limit .",
    "the grwa population amplitudes , obtained from equations  ( [ eq : bric2 ] ) , are thus    [ eq : solb ] @xmath104    after the rising time @xmath88 has passed , the grwa populations of levels 1 and 3 ( @xmath105 ) are seen to oscillate at a constant @xmath95-photon rabi frequency resulting from equation  ( [ eq : slow ] ) by putting @xmath89 .    the applicability range of the above special solution ( equations  ( [ eq : solb ] ) ) results from the requirement that @xmath38 and @xmath39 change slowly in time with respect to @xmath106 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitudes will change slowly if four inequalities are fulfilled : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the first inequality is realized in the lambda - configuration of the levels only ( figure  [ fig : lambda ] ) , while all other inequalities impose the upper limit on the applied electric field . since @xmath31 ,",
    "the strongest field is such that both @xmath111 and @xmath112 are much smaller than @xmath113 allowing @xmath111 and @xmath112 to be as high as of the order of 1 . for this strongest field ,",
    "one finds @xmath114 justifying the approximation for the bessel function @xmath115 . with this approximation ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : slow ] ) for @xmath116 reduces to :    [ eq : rabifreq ] @xmath117    where @xmath118 .",
    "nearly the same solution as our equations  ( [ eq : solb ] ) , but with @xmath116 given by equations  ( [ eq : rabifreq ] ) rather than general equation  ( [ eq : slow ] ) , can be obtained from the floquet - like analysis .",
    "however , this analysis seems to be less comfortable and consumes much more time than our derivation .",
    "the basis for this analysis is the series expansion for the atomic amplitudes @xmath119 and @xmath120 :    @xmath121    when substituted to equations  ( [ eq : set2 ] ) , this expansion results in the evolutions for the floquet - state amplitudes :    [ eq : floqueteq ] @xmath122    under the condition of @xmath123-photon resonance ( @xmath124 ) , equations  ( [ eq : floqueteq ] ) can be solved approximately in a truncated basis of states .",
    "the states of this basis are those forming the shortest coupling chain between the initial state of amplitude @xmath125 and the final state of amplitude @xmath126 .",
    "the number of intermediate states in this shortest chain depends on the multiphoton order @xmath95 . for @xmath127 ,",
    "i.e. , the case of degeneracy ( @xmath128 ) there is no intermediate state between the initial and final states characterized by @xmath125 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "there is also no intermediate state for @xmath130 but now the initial and final states are characterized by @xmath125 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "however , for @xmath132 there are @xmath133 intermediate states characterized by @xmath134 . by adiabatic elimination of all intermediate states",
    "one obtains a pair of equations for the amplitudes of the initial and final floquet states coupled by @xmath95-photon resonance :    @xmath135    where @xmath116 is given by equations  ( [ eq : rabifreq ] ) .",

    "this is , probably , the cost we pay for the approximate procedures , particularly the procedure of adiabatic elimination of @xmath33 from equations  ( [ eq : set1 ] ) .",
    "the adiabatic elimination has turned out to be the main reason of quantitative differences between the solid and dotted curves in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it was found that this procedure works better for higher ratios @xmath113 . by increasing this ratio well above the assumed value 13",
    ", the differences in the long - time population evolutions gradually decrease .",

    "for these conditions , equations  ( [ eq : slow ] ) and ( [ eq : rabifreq ] ) for @xmath116 need to be multiplied by the factor @xmath176 . after including this factor we were not able to solve the riccati equation  ( [ eq : riccati ] ) in an exact analytic way",
    "so , we solved numerically the grwa version of equations  ( [ eq : set3 ] ) for @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) and then obtained the solid - line curves shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "these curves , resulting from both the adiabatic and generalized rotating - wave approximations , are compared with the dot - line curves coming from the numerical integration of equations  ( [ eq : set1 ] ) .",
    "the comparison shows that , under the assumed conditions , the two approximations lead to results reflecting the main aspects of the exact ( numerical ) solution of equations  ( [ eq : set1 ] ) .",
    "again , by increasing the ratio @xmath113 ( from 19 to 50 ) much better agreement was found between the analytic and numerical curves ( see figure  [ fig:2](c ) ) . in the same time scale as in figure  [ fig:2](a ) , almost all the population is seen in figure  [ fig:2](c ) to move from the initial state 1 to state 3 but without the return 2-photon transition from 3 to 1 .",
    "the residual differences , still seen between the solid and dotted curves in figure  [ fig:2](c ) , may suggest that the approximate grwa multiphoton rabi frequencies given by equations  ( [ eq : rabifreq ] ) are not sufficiently accurate .",
    "however , taking @xmath116 in the form of equation  ( [ eq : slow ] ) has not removed the residual differences . as to the photon - emission spectrum shown in figure  [ fig:2](b )",
    ", we do not observe now any low structure in the high - frequency regime ( @xmath173 ) of the numerical spectrum ( dotted line ) .",
    "this makes a difference when compared to the numerical spectrum in figure  [ fig1](c ) .",

    "now , the present version of the approach allows strong depopulation of the initial state as well .",
    "the amended approach was shown to explain the main numerical results , particularly the two - photon rabi oscillations of population between the states forming the bottoms of @xmath180 and the dominant ( if not all ) peaks in the spectrum of scattered light . though we considered the 2-photon resonance between the lower states in @xmath180 , the approach holds for any even - photon resonance between the mentioned states as well as for the case of degeneration of these states ."
