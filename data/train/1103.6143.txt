    "semi - markov processes ( smp ) are a wide class of stochastic processes which generalize at the same time both markov chains and renewal processes .",
    "their main advantage is that of using whatever type of waiting time distribution for modeling the time to have a transition from one state to another one .",
    "this major flexibility has a price to pay : availability of data to estimate the parameters of the model which are more numerous .",
    "semi - markov processes generalizes also non - markovian models based on continuous time random walks used extensively in the econophysics community , see for example @xcite .",

    "we propose a semi - markov model for price return .",
    "more precisely we assume that the intraday returns ( up to one minute frequency ) are described by a discrete time homogeneous semi - markov process and the overnight returns are modeled by a markov chain . in this way we can consider differently the intraday and the overnight activities . to establish the validity of our model we tested it first of all by using a nonparametric test proposed by @xcite and then against two of the stylized facts which characterized financial data : the first passage time distribution @xcite and the autocorrelation function of the square of returns .    following the model we determine equations for the first passage distributions and the intraday autocorrelation function by using renewal type arguments .",
    "results from the model are then compared with empirical results obtained from the data .",
    "we show that these stylized facts are better reproduce when the semi - markov model is used compare to a simple markov chain .",
