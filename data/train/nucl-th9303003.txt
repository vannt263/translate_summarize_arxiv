    "the comparison between the measured and calculated isotope shifts is illustrated in figs .  2 and 3 as a series of successively better approximations .",
    "first , the crosses , connected by dashed lines to guide eyes , show the isotope shifts for spherical nuclei .",

    "proton interaction we use has the correct magnitude .",
    "next , the equilibrium deformation for the lighter cesium isotopes is included ( open squares ) , leading to a much better agreement .",
    "further improvement is achieved when the effect of zero  point quadrupole vibrational motion is taken into account .",
    "it is well known that the mean square radius of a vibrating nucleus is increased by @xcite @xmath90 we include this effect of the shape fluctuations using the quantities @xmath91 extracted from the measured transition matrix elements @xmath92 and the relation @xmath93^{-2 } ~.\\ ] ] we take the average @xmath94 of the corresponding xe and ba isotopes with neutron numbers @xmath95 and correct the radii of @xmath6cs@xmath1cs accordingly , as shown in figs .  2 and 3 .",

    "one should make a similar correction for the deformed cesium isotopes as well .",
    "since the corresponding @xmath94 values for the vibrational states are not known , and the corrections are expected to be small , we do not make them . instead , we somewhat arbitrarily assume that the zero  point motion correction is the same as in the semimagic @xmath101cs .",
    "we believe this explains the somewhat poorer agreement in the deformed cesium isotopes .    even though the quadrupole @xmath97 states contribute most to the mean square radius via eq .",
    "( [ rb ] ) , other vibrational states , e.g. , the octupole @xmath102 and the giant resonances , contribute as well ; however , all such states not only have smaller collective amplitudes but , even more importantly , vary more smoothly with the atomic mass ( or neutron number ) than the @xmath97 states , and hence their contribution to the shifts @xmath103 should be correspondingly smaller .    altogether , the error in the shift @xmath104 is at most 0.2  @xmath99 , and appears to be independent of the change in the neutron number @xmath105 .",
    "thus , for the following considerations we assign an uncertainty in the relative value of @xmath104 of 0.2  @xmath99 .",
    "very little is known experimentally about the moments @xmath106 .",
    "quite conservatively , we assume that the uncertainty in @xmath107 is @xmath108 5  @xmath109 .    before turning our attention to the neutron radii",

    "such a fermi distribution gives @xmath112 = 673  @xmath109 .",
    "our hf calculation corrected for zero  point vibrational motion with @xmath115 = 0.024 , as described above , gives @xmath116 = 23.27  @xmath99 for skmiii and 22.69  @xmath99 for skm * interaction , both quite close to the experimental value .",
    "the calculated @xmath112 moments ( not corrected for the zero  point motion ) are 671(skmiii ) and 652(skm * )  @xmath109 .",
    "we see , therefore , that the calculation is quite successful in the absolute radii ( and even surface thicknesses ) , in particular for the skmiii interaction ( which gives also the correct ground state spin ) .",
    "the calculated shifts in the neutron radii @xmath117 and @xmath118 are listed in tables i ( skm * ) and ii ( skmiii ) and the quantities @xmath117 corrected for the effect of zero  point vibrational motion are displayed in fig .",
    "several comments about these are in order .",
    "first , the slope of the dependence of @xmath119 for spherical configurations is correspondingly steeper than the slope following from @xmath89 .",
    "that is obviously a correct result ; the combination of a smaller slope in the proton radii and a larger slope in the neutron radii when neutrons are added is necessary to maintain on average the @xmath89 relation .",
    "second , the hf calculations imply that the proton and neutron distributions have essentially identical deformations .",
    "this agrees with the general conclusion about the isoscalar character of low  frequency collective modes in nuclei ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "thus , we accept this result and do not assign any additional uncertainty to the possible difference in the deformation of protons and neutrons .",
    "finally , for the same reason , we use the same @xmath94 values , and the @xmath91 extracted from them , to correct the neutron radii using eq .",
    "( [ rb ] ) . assuming all of the above",
    ", we assign _ identical _ uncertainties to the neutron shifts @xmath117 and the proton shifts @xmath104 , and similarly to the fourth moments @xmath120 .",
    "very little reliable experimental information on neutron distribution in nuclei is available . in ref .",

    "the nearest nucleus to cesium in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath121ce . scaling it with @xmath122",
    "one arrives at @xmath123 = 24.7  @xmath99 for @xmath6cs , somewhat larger than our calculated values 23.7 and 24.0 for skm * and skmiii , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the theoretical neutron density of brack _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with @xmath123 = 23.5  @xmath99 , was used .",
    "that value , presumably obtained by interpolation from the values obtained by the hf method using the skm * interaction , is , not surprisingly , quite close to our calculated values .",
    "this limited comparison suggests that the absolute radii @xmath123 have uncertainties of about 1  @xmath99 .",
    "the uncertainty in the shifts @xmath117 should be substantially smaller , and our estimated error of 0.2  @xmath99 does not seem unreasonable .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the uncertainty in the integrals @xmath24 was estimated from the spread of the calculated values with a wide variety of interactions .",
    "some of the interactions employed in @xcite give better agreement for known quantities ( charge radii , binding energies , etc . )",
    "than others .",
    "we chose to use only the two most successful interactions .",
    "the spread in the calculated shifts @xmath86 for these two interactions is less than our postulated error of 0.2  @xmath99 .",
    "pollock _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also argue that the isovector surface term @xmath124 in the skyrme lagrangian is poorly determined and may affect the neutron skin significantly , without affecting most bulk nuclear properties .",
    "we tested this claim by modifying simultaneously the coefficients @xmath125 and @xmath126 in eq .",
    "( [ hfd ] ) .",
    "we find that when we vary @xmath127 ( i.e. , the relative strength of the isovector surface term ) from + 0.3 to -0.3 the proton radius @xmath111 changes indeed very little ( about 0.06  @xmath99 ) and the neutron radius changes somewhat more ( by about 0.1  @xmath99 , still less than our estimated error ) .",
    "however , the binding energy changes by about 5  mev , more than the largest discrepancy between the theory and experiment .",

    "it is easy now to evaluate the uncertainty in the factors @xmath24 given the coefficients @xmath139 and our estimates of the uncertainties in @xmath131 and @xmath22 . substituting the corresponding values , we find that the uncertainty is @xmath144 = 4.6@xmath14510@xmath146 , caused almost entirely by the uncertainty in the mean square radii @xmath147 .",
    "this uncertainty represents about 1% of the deviations of @xmath24 values from unity .    before evaluating the nuclear structure corrections @xmath29 we have to consider the effect of the intrinsic nucleon structure .",

    "<S> the interpretation of future precise experiments on atomic parity violation in terms of parameters of the standard model could be hampered by uncertainties in the atomic and nuclear structure . </S>",
    "<S> while the former can be overcome by measurement in a series of isotopes , the nuclear structure requires knowledge of the neutron density . </S>",

    "<S> we argue that the good agreement with the experimental charge radii , binding energies , and ground state spins signifies that the phenomenological nuclear force and the method of calculation that we use is adequate . </S>",
    "<S> based on this agreement , and on calculations involving different effective interactions , we estimate the uncertainties in the differences of the neutron radii @xmath2 and conclude that they cause uncertainties in the ratio of weak charges , the quantities determined in the atomic parity nonconservation experiments , of less than @xmath3 . such an uncertainty is smaller than the anticipated experimental error </S>",
