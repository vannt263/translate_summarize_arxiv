    "the region of the nuclear chart between the mg and ni isotopes is important for the next generation of radioactive beam experiments and for several astrophysical applications .",
    "the interest in the theoretical calculations for _ sd_-shell nuclei around @xmath1ca  @xcite has increased recently with the discovery of highly deformed shapes and superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands in the n = z nuclei @xmath0ar  @xcite , @xmath1ca  @xcite , @xmath9ca  @xcite , @xmath2cr  @xcite and @xmath3ni  @xcite .",
    "therefore the a@xmath10 @xmath11 30 - 60 mass region becomes of particular interest since quasimolecular resonances have also been observed for these @xmath12-like nuclei , in particular , in the @xmath13si+@xmath13si reaction  @xcite .",
    "although there is no experimental evidence to link the sd bands with the higher lying rotational bands formed by known quasimolecular resonances  @xcite , both phenomena are believed to originate from highly deformed configurations of these systems .",
    "the interpretation of resonant structures observed in the excitation functions in various combinations of light @xmath12-cluster nuclei in the energy regime from the barrier up to regions with excitation energies of 30 - 50  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate .",
    "in particular , in collisions between two @xmath14 nuclei , these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite . however , in many cases these structures have been connected to strongly deformed shapes and to the alpha - clustering phenomena , predicted from the @xmath12-cluster model  @xcite , hartree - fock calculations  @xcite , the nilsson - strutinsky approach  @xcite , and from a generalized liquid drop model  @xcite . in this paper we will show that the search for strongly deformed shapes in n = z nuclei is also the domain of charged - particle spectroscopy . in particular the study of a number of @xmath12-cluster nuclei with the charged particle multidetector array icare at the vivitron facility is presented in sec .  2 .",
    "in sec .  3 , the search for a @xmath6c+@xmath6c molecule in @xmath5mg@xmath15 is discussed with a description of a recent particle-@xmath4 experiment using euroball iv .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion of our results is added in sec .  4 for both topics .",

    "the lcp s emitted during the cn decay processes carry information on the underlying nuclear shapes and level densities .",
    "new information on nuclear structure far above the yrast line can be obtained from their study by a comparison with statistical - model calculations .",
    "an experimental programme is undertaken at the vivitron tandem facility of the ires strasbourg laboratory in the icare scattering chamber .",
    "both the heavy fragments ( a @xmath16 10 ) and their associated lcp s ( protons , deuterons , tritons , @xmath17he , and @xmath12 particles ) were detected in coincidence using the icare charged - particle multidetector array  @xcite which consists of nearly 50 telescopes .",
    "the properties of the lcp s emitted in the @xmath13si+@xmath13si reaction at the bombarding energy e@xmath8 = 112 mev , which corresponds to the @xmath3ni excitation energy of the conjectured j@xmath18 = 38@xmath19 quasimolecular resonance  @xcite , were first investigated  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the adjustments in the yrast line position suggests deformation effects at high spin for the @xmath3ni composite system in agreement with very recent @xmath4-ray spectroscopy data obtained at much lower spins  @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the generalized liquid drop model developed by g. royer and coworkers  @xcite . the extent to which the resonant behaviour is responsible to the observed nuclear deformation is still an open question . to resolve this issue ,",
    "we have performed a subsequent @xmath13si+@xmath13si experiment at e@xmath8 = 180 mev outside the `` molecular window '' where quasimolecular resonances are known to disappear  @xcite .",
    "the strong cluster emission of @xmath20be which was observed by the @xmath13si+@xmath6c reaction  @xcite has motivated the search for similar effects in the @xmath21al+@xmath6c  @xcite , @xmath22p+@xmath6c  @xcite , @xmath23s+@xmath6c  @xcite , and @xmath24o+@xmath13si  @xcite reactions .",

    "the analysis of the data has been performed using cacarizo  @xcite , the monte carlo version of the statistical - model code cascade .",
    "the parameters needed for the statistical description , i.e. the nuclear level densities and the barrier transmission probabilities , are usually obtained from the study of lcp evaporation spectra .",
    "the change in the emission barriers and , correspondingly , the transmission probabilities affects the lower energy part of the calculated evaporation spectra . on the other hand",
    "the high - energy part of the @xmath12-particle spectra depends critically on the available phase space obtained from the level densities at high spin .",
    "this is clearly shown by the solid and dashed lines of fig .  1 for @xmath13si+@xmath13si at e@xmath8 = 180 mev .",

    "1 show the predictions using the same parameter set with deformation effects that has been used at e@xmath8 = 180 mev @xcite .",
    "predictions with the parameters of the finite - range liquid drop model  @xcite are unable to reproduce the data ( dashed lines ) . since the highest incident energy is outside of the `` molecular window '' @xcite , we conclude that the highly deformed shapes ( with @xmath43 @xmath11 0.5 ) observed for both energies are not related to the @xmath13si+@xmath13si quasimolecular resonances  @xcite",
    ". however they may still be linked to shape isomerism of rotating @xmath3ni as suggested very recently by g. royer _ et al . _",
    "similarly , the extremely extended shapes that are needed to explain the @xmath12-particle spectra measured in the @xmath13si+@xmath6c  @xcite , @xmath23s+@xmath6c  @xcite , and @xmath13si+@xmath24o  @xcite reactions should correspond to shape isomerism of rotating @xmath1ca  @xcite and @xmath44ti  @xcite .",
    "superimposed on the maxwellian shapes typical of their evaporative origin , nonstatistical @xmath12-particles components were found in the energy spectra measured in coincidence with s residues in the @xmath13si+@xmath6c reaction  @xcite and ar residues for the @xmath23s+@xmath6c reaction  @xcite , respectively . in both reactions",
    ", these additional components attributed to the decay of unbound @xmath45be nuclei are more easily observed in the corresponding energy correlation plot displayed in fig .  3 ( left side of the upper panel ) .",
    "they appear as well defined peaks lying outside the `` statistical evaporation region '' which is consistent with cacarizo calculations ( see fig .  10 of ref .",
    "their `` folding angles '' are compatible with the two - body kinematics required for the @xmath23s+@xmath20be binary exit - channel . to clearly establish the mechanism resulting in these yields subsequent experiments",
    "have been undertaken with other reaction with a @xmath6c target  @xcite such as @xmath21al(150 mev)+@xmath6c and @xmath22p(112 mev)+@xmath6c .",
    "2 also displays the energy - correlation plots between @xmath12 particles and er s for three of these reactions  @xcite and for the @xmath24o+@xmath13si reaction at e@xmath8(@xmath24o ) = 112 mev  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the two - body components do not show - up for this last reaction  @xcite indicates the binary nature of the @xmath12-particle peaks present in the reactions involving a @xmath6c target .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the cluster - transfer picture proposed by morgenstern _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for incomplete fusion mechanisms .",
    "to summarize this topic , we have confirmed that the charged - particle spectroscopy appears to be a very efficient technique to search for superdeformed and hyperdeformed shapes in light ions , as well as to identify @xmath20be and @xmath6c @xmath12-cluster emissions with excellent selectivity at high excitation energy .",
    "in the presentation of the second topic of this paper we investigate the question whether @xmath6c+@xmath6c molecular resonances represent true cluster states in the @xmath5 mg compound system , or whether they simply reflect scattering states in the ion - ion potential is still unresolved .",
    "various decay branches from the highly excited @xmath5mg@xmath46 nucleus , including the emission of @xmath12 particles or heavier fragments such as @xmath20be and @xmath6c , are possibly available .",
    "however , @xmath4-decays have not been observed so far . actually the @xmath4-ray branches are predicted to be rather small at these excitation energies ,",
    "although some experiments have been reported  @xcite , which have searched for these very small branches expected in the range of @xmath47  fractions of the total width  @xcite .",
    "the rotational bands built on the knowledge of the measured spins and excitation energies can be extended to rather small angular momenta , where finally the @xmath4-decay becomes a larger part of the total width .",
    "the population of such states in @xmath12-cluster nuclei , which are lying below the threshold for fission decays and for other particle decays , is favored in binary reactions , where at a fixed incident energy the composite nucleus is formed with an excitation energy range governed by the two - body reaction kinematics .",
    "these states may be coupled to intrinsic states of @xmath5mg@xmath15 as populated by a breakup process ( via resonances ) as shown in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5mg+@xmath6c reaction has been extensively investigated by several measurements of the @xmath6c(@xmath5mg,@xmath6c@xmath6c)@xmath6c breakup channel  @xcite .",
    "sequential breakups are found to occur from specific states in @xmath5 mg at excitation energies ranging from 20 to 35 mev , which are linked to the ground state and also have an appreciable overlap with the @xmath6c+@xmath6c quasi - molecular configuration .",
    "several attempts @xcite were made to link the @xmath6c+@xmath6c barrier resonances @xcite with the breakup states .",
    "the underlying reaction mechanism is now fairly well established  @xcite and many of the barrier resonances appear to be correlated indicating that a common structure may exist in both instances . this is another indication of the possible link between barrier resonances and secondary minima in the compound nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the study of particle-@xmath4 coincidences in binary reactions in reverse kinematics is probably a unique tool for the search for extreme shapes related to clustering . in this way",
    "the @xmath5mg+@xmath6c reaction has been investigated with high selectivity at e@xmath8(@xmath5 mg ) = 130 mev with the binary reaction spectrometer  @xcite ( brs ) in coincidence with euroball iv installed at the vivitron  @xcite .",
    "the choice of the @xmath48 reaction implies that for an incident energy of e@xmath8 = 130  mev an excitation energy range up to e@xmath15 = 30  mev in @xmath5 mg is covered  @xcite .",
    "the brs gives access to a novel approach to the study of nuclei at large deformations  @xcite .",
    "the excellent channel selection capability of binary and/or ternary fragments gives a powerful identification among the reaction channels , implying that euroball iv is used mostly with one or two - fold multiplicities , for which the total @xmath4-ray efficiency is very high .",
    "the brs trigger consists of a kinematical coincidence set - up combining two large - area heavy - ion telescopes .",
    "both detector telescopes comprise each a two - dimensional position sensitive low - pressure multiwire chamber in conjunction with a bragg - curve ionization chamber .",
    "all detection planes are four - fold subdivided in order to improve the resolution and to increase the counting rate capability ( 100 k - events / s ) .",
    "the two - body q - value has been reconstructed using events for which both fragments are in well selected states chosen for spectroscopy purposes as well as to determine the reaction mechanism responsible for the population of these peculiar states .",
    "3 displays a typical example of a two - dimensional bragg - peak versus energy spectrum obtained for the @xmath5mg+@xmath6c reaction .",
    "this coincident spectrum shows the excellent charge discrimination achieved with the bragg - curve ionization chambers .",
    "the z=12 gate , which is shown in fig .  3",
    ", will be used in the following for the processing of the @xmath4-ray spectra of the @xmath5 mg nucleus of interest .",
    "the inverse kinematics of the @xmath5mg+@xmath6c reaction and the negative q - values give ideal conditions for the trigger on the brs , because the angular range is optimum for @xmath49 = 12@xmath50 - 40@xmath50 in the lab - system ( with @xmath49 = 12@xmath50 - 25@xmath50 for the recoils ) and because the solid angle transformation gives a factor  10 for the detection of the heavy fragments .",
    "thus we have been able to cover a large part of the angular distribution of the binary process with high efficiency , and a selection of events in particular angular ranges has been achieved . in binary exit - channels",
    "the exclusive detection of both ejectiles allows precise q - value determination , z - resolution and simultaneously optimal doppler - shift correction .",
    "4 displays a doppler - corrected @xmath4-ray spectrum for @xmath5 mg events in coincidence with the z=12 gate defined in the bragg - peak vs energy spectrum of fig .",
    "all known transitions of @xmath5 mg  @xcite can be identified in the energy range depicted .",
    "as expected we see decays feeding the yrast line of @xmath5 mg up to the 8@xmath51 level .",
    "the population of some of the observed states , in particular , the 2@xmath19 , 3@xmath19 and 4@xmath19 members of the k=2 rotational band , appears to be selectively enhanced .",
    "the strong population of the k=2 band has also been observed in the @xmath6c(@xmath6c,@xmath4 ) radiative capture reaction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is an indication of a @xmath4-ray around 5.95 mev which may be identified with the 10@xmath52 @xmath53 8@xmath51 transition as proposed in ref .",
    "it has been checked in the @xmath4-@xmath4 coincidences that most of the states of fig .",
    "4 belong to cascades which contain the characteristic 1368 kev @xmath4-ray and pass through the lowest 2@xmath19 state in @xmath5 mg . still a number of transitions in the high - energy part of the spectrum ( 6000  kev  -  8000  kev ) have not been clearly identified .",
    "the reason why the search for a @xmath4-decay in @xmath6c+@xmath6c has not been conclusive so far  @xcite is due to the excitation energy in @xmath5 mg as well as the spin region ( 8@xmath54 - 12@xmath54 ) which were chosen too high .",
    "the next step of the analysis will be the use of the brs trigger in order to select the excitation energy range by the two - body q - value ( in the @xmath6c+@xmath5 mg channel ) , and thus we will be able to study the region around the decay barriers , where @xmath4-decay becomes observable .",
    "according to recent predictions @xmath4-rays from 6@xmath19 @xmath53 4@xmath19 should have measurable branching ratios .",
    "work is currently in progress to analyse the @xmath4 rays from the @xmath6c(@xmath5mg,@xmath6c @xmath6c)@xmath6c ternary breakup reaction .",

    "the occurence of highly deformed configurations in light n = z nuclei and their possible link with alpha - clustering have been investigated at the vivitron tandem facility of the ires strasbourg by using two complementary experimental techniques : either the icare charged - particle multidetector array or the brs / euroball iv detection system . in the first case .",
    "the properties of the emitted lcp s in several reactions have been analysed with the cacarizo statistical - model code that was adapted to calculate evaporation spectra and angular distributions for deformed nuclei .",
    "the measured observables such as energy spectra in - plane and out - of - plane angular correlations are well described by hauser - feshbach calculations which include spin - dependent level densities .",
    "the magnitude of the adjustements in the yrast line suggests deformations at high spins that are far in excess of those predicted by the finite - range liquid drop model  @xcite .",
