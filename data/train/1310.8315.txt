    "according to the central theorem by mermin and wagner,@xcite low - dimensional heisenberg magnets with sufficiently short - ranged isotropic interactions do not order magnetically at any finite temperature in one or two spatial dimensions .",
    "the standard way in which real systems eventually evade this theorem is via weak inter - plane or inter - chain interactions which , no matter how weak , are enough to mitigate the entropic fluctuations and stabilize long range order ( lro ) below a characteristic temperature @xmath6 . by now , many aspects of this important ordering transition are theoretically well understood@xcite and tested by many experiments.@xcite for example , one of the key factors affecting the value of @xmath6 is the fluctuation strength of the low - dimensional units ( planes or chains ) and , hence , their dimensionality .",
    "this aspect is already exposed by mean - field theory,@xcite which shows that for weakly coupled antiferromagnetic ( afm ) planes ( or chains ) , @xmath6 is given by [ eq : rpaa ] ^s(t_n(j))=  , where @xmath8 is the interlayer ( resp .",

    "@xmath13 ) is the coordination number .    here , we study what happens when magnetic units of different dimensionality are brought together in a single material and , in particular , when successive afm layers couple to each other only via intermediate afm chains .",
    "this situation is realized in the spin-@xmath0 compound cup@xmath1o@xmath2 , where a 2d sublattice with stronger magnetic couplings coexists with a 1d sublattice featuring weaker magnetic couplings .",
    "systems of this type have been scarcely studied in the past , both experimentally and theoretically , yet they raise a number of interesting and so far unresolved questions . what is the nature of the transition and the magnetic behavior of the two sublattices below @xmath6 ?",
    "which energy scale determines the value of @xmath6 ?    the experiments presented below show clearly that the coexistence of two dimensionalities hinders the overall three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetic order in cup@xmath1o@xmath2 and , additionally , leads to a very peculiar situation where the 1d sublattice remains partly paramagnetic below @xmath6 .",

    "( [ eq : rpaa ] ) to [ eq : rpab ] |^s(t_n(j))=  , where @xmath14 is the geometric mean of the two staggered susceptibilities . as we discuss below , the physical meaning of this equation can be understood in terms of an effective , temperature - dependent interlayer coupling @xmath15 , mediated by the chains .",
    "regarding the crystal structure of cup@xmath1o@xmath2 , this compound features two crystallographically inequivalent positions of the magnetic cu@xmath16 ions . despite the similar local environment , which is well described by cuo@xmath17 planar units ,",

    "in contrast to previous studies that focused only on phenomenological aspects of this material , we provide a detailed microscopic scenario of cup@xmath1o@xmath2 and establish the combination of 1d and 2d magnetism taking place on different energy scales , thus leading to a magnetic ordering transition around 8  k with a remarkably low @xmath22 .",

    "in our case the esr signal could be also observed below 8  k , yet with a different resonance field @xmath84 .",
    "the persistence of the paramagnetic esr signal below @xmath6 is rooted in the different behavior of the two sublattices in cup@xmath1o@xmath2 . the standard situation in afm resonance",
    "@xcite is that below @xmath6 the resonance frequencies @xmath88 shift far away from the paramagnetic value @xmath89 , owing to the presence of anisotropy and the buildup of strong local exchange fields .",
    "this is exactly what we expect here for the cu1 spins , since their moments grow quickly below @xmath6 and the anisotropy field is effectively induced by the dm interactions ( or equivalently by the weak ferromagnetic moments , see sec .",

    "the cu2 spins on the chains , on the other hand , have a qualitatively different behavior : ( i ) there is no dm anisotropy along the chains due to inversion symmetry , and ( ii ) the moments grow significantly slower than those on cu1 in the layers , because thermal fluctuations remain strong in a finite @xmath90 range @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the persistence of the paramagnetic esr signal below @xmath6 is essentially a fingerprint of this partly paramagnetic behavior of cu1 spins .",

    "thermodynamic properties of this compound are well explained by a superposition of the 1d and 2d sublattices .",
    "however , a phenomenological analysis of the data is not straight - forward .",

    "[ fig : heat ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , the decomposition of the overall 3d spin lattice into two low - dimensional sublattices remains valid at low temperatures , even below the nel temperature @xmath6 , where the lro state involving both sublattices is formed .",
    "the nel temperature of @xmath7 is remarkably low for a quasi-2d antiferromagnet .",
    "a simple mean - field treatment shows that the coupling of 2d units via 1d units or , more generally , via any spin units with strong spin fluctuations will reduce the ordering temperature dramatically .",
    "this system follows an `` averaged '' scenario , which is intermediate between 2d and 1d .",
    "more precisely , the ordering is described at the mean - field level by the geometrical mean of the staggered susceptibilities of the 1d and 2d spin sublattices .",
    "another interesting aspect is the ordered state of cup@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the ordering in the 2d sublattice manifests itself by the weak net moment observed below @xmath6 .",
    "although this order has not been seen by neutron diffraction,@xcite both esr and the formation of net moment safely confirm the onset of the long - range magnetic order at 8  k , whereas the lack of the magnetic reflections may be ascribed to an insufficient sensitivity of the neutron experiment . indeed , in a quasi-2d system , an ordered moment of only 0.6  @xmath55 is expected.@xcite the persistent paramagnetic esr signal below @xmath6 gives strong evidence for the very weak cu2 moments along the chains .",
    "further studies of the ordered state of cup@xmath1o@xmath2 with neutron scattering and/or @xmath215p nuclear magnetic resonance are highly desirable and are presently underway .    surprisingly , only a few systems combining different types of spin lattices have been reported so far .",
    "the combination of spin chains and 2d square - lattice units is typical for the family of yba@xmath1cu@xmath216o@xmath217 high - temperature superconductors , but the relevant charge - ordered state has never been achieved there . indeed , at @xmath218 all cu ions should be in the 2 + spin-@xmath0 state , but residual charge transfer leads to a doping and superconductivity,@xcite so that the purely spin physics of a magnetic insulator can not be probed .",
    "we also note an interesting , albeit purely phenomenological similarity between cup@xmath1o@xmath2 and cub@xmath1o@xmath17 , where three consecutive magnetic transitions have been observed.@xcite although several studies consider the spin system of cub@xmath1o@xmath17 as a combination of square planes with strong couplings ( compare to the cu1 planes in cup@xmath1o@xmath2 ) and interstitial cu@xmath219 sites with weak couplings ( compare to the cu2 chains in cup@xmath1o@xmath2 ) , details of the microscopic magnetic model are far from being understood . moreover , some of the magnetic structures are incommensurate and likely influenced by substantial dm couplings .",
    "the case of cup@xmath1o@xmath2 should be more simple , because only one of the couplings features the dm component .",
    "this component is quite small and leads to a trivial spin canting without the complex helical modulation observed in cub@xmath1o@xmath17 .    in summary",
    ", we have studied thermodynamic properties and developed a microscopic magnetic model for cup@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "the dm couplings in the cu1 sublattice induce a weak , but clearly visible spin canting .",
    "moreover , the paramagnetic esr signal below 8  k puts forward substantial fluctuations that persist even below @xmath6 .",
