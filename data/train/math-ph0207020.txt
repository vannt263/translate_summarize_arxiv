    "[ rem:5.4 ] in some sense , the case of laplace - beltrami operators is the opposite of the case of divergence type operators : while the divergence type operator needs the factor @xmath223 to be _ large _ on @xmath4 to produce spectral gaps , the laplace - beltrami operator needs the factor @xmath224 to be _ small _ on @xmath4 .",
    "[ rem:5.5 ] davies and harrell  [ dh ] proved the existence of at least one gap in the periodic conformally flat case ( transforming the conformal laplacian into a corresponding schrdinger operator ) .",
    "this result is a special case of our result . using similar methods as  [ dh ] , green [ g ] obtained examples with a finite number of gaps in the @xmath217-dimensional conformally flat case .",
    "recently , yoshitomi  [ y ] proved the existence of spectral gaps for the ( dirichlet ) laplacian on periodically curved quantum wave guides . in [ dh , g , y ] ,",
    "the existence of gaps is established by analyzing a one - dimensional problem . here ,",
    "in contrast , we directly study the multi - dimensional problem .",
    "[ rem:5.6 ] more `` geometric '' constructions of periodic manifolds with spectral gaps can be found in [ p-1,2 ] , think for example of an infinite number of copies of a compact manifold , joined by thin cylinders .",
    "if these cylinders are small or thin enough , one again obtains spectral gaps of the corresponding laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "these results are closely related to earlier works of chavel and feldman  [ cf ] and ann  [ a ] .",
