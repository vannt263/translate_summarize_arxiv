    "in the classical theory of radiation by a charged particle one calculates the energy radiated into the electromagnetic field . indeed from the purely classical point of view",
    "the energy is practically the only quantity there _ is _ to calculate .",
    "however , in certain problems  @xcite one may come upon the idea of finding the _ number _ of photons radiated by a charged particle following a given trajectory .",
    "although the photon is a quantum concept and so the question of finding the number might be thought to involve quantum mechanics , it does so only in the most minimal way .",
    "given the energy radiated into a given mode of the field , it is only necessary to use planck s relation and divide by the frequency @xmath0 to find the number @xmath1 ; thus the problem remains an essentially classical one .",
    "it might be objected that @xmath1 can be infinite while the energy is finite , as in the well - known `` infrared catastrophe '' .",
    "true , but as we shall see , there is an interesting class of cases where this is _ not _ the case . in particular when the trajectory of a charged particle begins and ends with the same vector velocity @xmath2 , @xmath1 is generally finite .",
    "this is because the `` infrared catastrophe '' results from the difference in the long flight paths for the in - and - outgoing particles , and when they are the same , the `` catastrophe '' is averted .    on the other hand",
    ", bremsstrahlung calculations often have an `` ultraviolet '' or high frequency divergence , due to the sudden appearance or deflection of a charge @xcite .",
    "evidently one can not emit an infinite number of _ finite _ energy photons , so this divergence must be an artifact of the calculation .",
    "this difficulty can have either a quantum or classical resolution . in the quantum solution , as in the feynman graph technique , one takes into account the energy - momentum conservation usually neglected at the classical level , and a suppression results for high energy photons .",
    "however , and more of interest to us here , there can also be a classical resolution : the ultraviolet divergence results from abrupt changes in the trajectory , and if the velocity changes or accelerations are sufficiently smooth , there is no divergence .",
    "therefore we have the interesting situation that for a smooth trajectory , beginning and ending with the same velocities , the number of photons @xmath1 radiated according to a classical calculation should be finite . but",
    "@xmath1 is a dimensionless , lorentz - invariant quantity .",
    "thus there ought to be some simple formula for it , a relation mapping the path of a particle in space - time to the real number , @xmath1 .",
    "this relation is : @xmath3 in this formula @xmath4 and @xmath5 are four - dimensional coordinates , referring to points on the space - time path of the charged particle , so that @xmath6 is a 4-vectorial element of the path ( fig 1 ) .",
    "one may introduce the proper time or invariant path length @xmath7 and the four - velocity @xmath8 to also write the expression as @xmath9    @xmath10 is the four - distance between the points @xmath11 in the following way @xmath12 as we shall explain shortly the @xmath13 is necessary to make sense of and to properly define  eq  [ [ n ] ] .    it is interesting that the sommerfeld fine structure constant @xmath14 , involving planck s quantum constant , appears .",
    "it arises , however , not as a coupling constant , but rather from the conversion of the classical energy to quanta , where we finally must divide by @xmath15 .",
    "the expression is a non - perturbative .",
    "if the particle is multiply charged with @xmath16 electron charges , the formula should be multiplied by @xmath17 . observe that by interchanging @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the integrations one can reverse the sign of @xmath13 to show that @xmath1 is real .",
    "the expression is not an integer since it represents the average or expectation value of the number of particles radiated .",
    "we can derive  eq  [ [ n ] ] from the standard treatments of classical radiation theory  @xcite ,  @xcite where one calculates @xmath20 , the fourier components of the three - vector current , and then finds the energy radiation rate @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angle between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . dividing by @xmath25 ( units @xmath26)gives @xmath1 .    to obtain the total number",
    ", we sum over all modes @xmath23 of the radiation field , @xmath27    one could try to perform the integrations for every particular trajectory , but we would like to find a general formula in terms of the path itself",
    ". thus we attempt to perform the @xmath28 integration first , before the fourier transform .",
    "this gives at first a not well - defined expression , which leads to the need to introduce the @xmath13 .    to see how this comes about",
    ", we observe that for smooth paths @xmath29 the fourier transform @xmath30 is strongly convergent at large @xmath25 .",
    "when we introduce the current density for our classical point particle as    @xmath31    we have @xmath32 for the fourier transform . since the path of the particle is time ",
    "like the exponent can never become zero , and if @xmath33 or @xmath34 have no jumps or kinks the integral vanishes rapidly for large @xmath25 .",
    "eq  [ [ nj ] ] can be rewritten in a more covariant way using @xmath35 and noting the current conservation relation @xmath36 , so that eq  [ [ nj ] ] is essentially the integral of the four - vector squared @xmath37 . using @xmath38 one",
    "has a compact line integral expression for @xmath39 , namely @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the four dimensional scalar product @xmath42 , with @xmath43    squaring eq  [ [ jmu ] ] and writing in the constants  @xcite we get for the integral of @xmath44 over all modes of the radiation field :    @xmath45    firm in the belief that we actually have a well defined , convergent expression , we allow ourselves to do the @xmath28 integral first and to use some @xmath13 manipulations in dealing with seemingly ill - defined expressions .    after a few steps we get to the expression @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and where here @xmath22 is the angle between @xmath48 and the vector @xmath49 .",
    "now , since we believe that our expressions are rapidly vanishing at large @xmath25 and @xmath25 is always positive , it should nt hurt to add an @xmath13 in the exponent  @xcite , to make the replacement @xmath50 .",
    "the integral is then convergent , and integrating over @xmath51 and keeping track of the @xmath52 , this leads to @xmath53 and so eq  [ [ n ] ] .    although these manipulations are similar to those with the invariant d functions in _ quantum _ field theory , and our function @xmath54 resembles a @xmath55 function , our assumption of smooth paths has lead us to an `` @xmath13 prescription '' in position rather than in momentum space .",
    "the difficult job now becomes the evaluation of the @xmath13 in eq  [ [ n ] ] .",
    "we look for guidance to the theory of generalized functions  @xcite where one has the relation    @xmath57    where we have specialized to the case of an even function @xmath58 .    one way of understanding this relation is to note that , for @xmath56 non - zero ,    @xmath59    which just follows from explicit integration .",
    "thus we have simply subtracted zero in eq  [ [ f0 ] ] , and have chosen the coefficient of this zero term in such a way as to cancel the singularity of the integrand . with @xmath60 even , @xmath61 , and the expression is indeed finite at the singularity .",
    "can we apply the same idea here ? that is , by examining the neighborhood of the singularity for small but non - zero @xmath56 we see that our expression is finite and @xmath56 independent .",
    "we would thus like to subtract something which is zero for finite @xmath56 and which will regulate the singularity at @xmath62 in eq  [ [ n ] ] , enabling us to finally dispense with @xmath56 altogether .",
    "the problem , however , would seem to be much more difficult than in eq  [ [ f0 ] ] .",
    "there we simply had to adjust one constant , namely @xmath63 .",
    "here we need a function @xmath64 , such that when it is integrated over @xmath65 gives zero and then can be adjusted to cancel the numerator @xmath66 when we make the replacement @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore it should do this for _ any _ path @xmath68 we care to put in the formula .",
    "this last requirement rules out , for example , the at first likely- looking candidate replacement @xmath69 . since @xmath70 for @xmath71 this would regulate the singularity and looks promising .",
    "but it does nt work , @xmath72 is obviously path dependent and can not be zero for all paths .",
    "this , however , suggests a solution .",
    "if we can find something for @xmath60 which is a total derivative and so can be integrated , it would depend only on the end points of the path and not on the path itself . to this end , note the following useful relation .",
    "let @xmath73 be some function of @xmath74 where @xmath75 , then @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 refer to first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "since the expression is a total derivative and its integral is independent of the path and is to be interpreted as zero , we may look for some choice for @xmath73 that leads to @xmath80 for @xmath81 and so might cancel the singularity .",
    "this occurs in fact if we consider @xmath82 .",
    "the above equation becomes    @xmath83    since @xmath84 for @xmath81 the expression @xmath80 at the singularity .",
    "now we want to add this to eq  [ [ nn ] ] , that is to @xmath85 , with some weight such that the singularity at @xmath86 is cancelled . to determine this weight note that since the four velocity satisfies @xmath87 the rhs of eq  [ [ tautaua ] ] goes to @xmath88 for @xmath81 .",
    "hence we must subtract @xmath89 of eq  [ [ tautaua ] ] from eq  [ [ nn ] ] to remove the singularity . doing this",
    "we end up with the following nice relation .",
    "@xmath90    or alternatively @xmath91 the notation is meant to indicate that while the @xmath13 is in @xmath79 on the left , it is not needed on the right .",
    "we can rewrite these equations in an interesting way by noting that @xmath92 is like an average 4-velocity connecting the points @xmath93 , which we might call @xmath94 in analogy to the instantaneous 4-velocity @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96    then we can write    @xmath97    we can now introduce the notion of a `` transverse vector '' @xmath98 associated with the points @xmath11 at @xmath99 .",
    "this is the vector @xmath100 with the `` longitudinal '' part , that is the component along @xmath101 , removed :    @xmath102    with these definitions , @xmath103 , which is the numerator in eq  [ [ naau ] ] and we can write the above equations in terms of products of `` transverse vectors '' : @xmath104    hence we can say that our integral for @xmath1 represents the `` interaction '' of pairs of transverse vectors along the path of the charge .",
    "the possible singularity at @xmath105 is absent because @xmath106 vanishes for two points very close together .",
    "we summarize some properties of these quantities : @xmath101 and @xmath100 are unit vectors , @xmath107 . from their definitions",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath98 are orthogonal @xmath108 .",
    "note for straight line motion or more generally for any smooth path as @xmath81    @xmath109    unlike @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath98 is a space - like ( or zero ) vector .",
    "this follows from the fact that there is a frame where the time component of @xmath98 vanishes , namely the restframe of the time - like @xmath101 .",
    "we note a point concerning the definition of @xmath101 in eq  [ [ str ] ] .",
    "this point is irrelevant in all those expressions where @xmath110 or @xmath101 appears quadratically , but we mention it for consistency .",
    "namely , we would like @xmath101 to resemble the velocity .",
    "therefore it must be understood that @xmath111 is `` directed '' ; an odd function , positive for @xmath112 and negative for @xmath113 , like @xmath114 .",
    "it implies a definition of @xmath101 such that @xmath115 and that @xmath101 is `` forward pointing '' , i.e. @xmath116 is always positive .",
    "an interesting expression for @xmath98 follows from the definition of @xmath101 in eq  [ [ str ] ] , reflecting the fact that the derivative of a unit vector is transverse to itself :    @xmath117    with this , we can also write eq  [ [ nabu ] ] in some different looking ways : @xmath118    or , since @xmath119 and so @xmath120 we can also write    @xmath121    another variant results if we note that  eq  [ [ aa ] ] looks like the cross terms of a quadratic expression : @xmath122 $ ] . introducing the sum and difference variables @xmath123 and @xmath124    @xmath125~d\\tau_+ d\\tau_- \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where because of the rotation of the coordinates in the @xmath126 plane , the integration boundaries now have the form of a diamond instead of a square .",
    "the @xmath13 takes care of the high frequency or ultraviolet behavior , but there might be questions concerning the infrared region .",
    "we see this very simply if we consider the stationary particle with @xmath127 , for which @xmath1 of course should be zero .",
    "eq[[n ] ] leads to    @xmath128    there are two kinds of limits implied here @xmath129 , and some upper / lower limit of the integration @xmath130 , and the integral can depend on how the limits are taken .",
    "if we simply apply eq  [ [ f1 ] ] we get of course zero , as desired . on the other hand if we interpret the limits at @xmath131 by , say , integrating over some test function which is constant up to some large number @xmath132 and then drops off , we can get an answer involving @xmath133 , which depends on the order in which we take @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "the problem originates in the fact that we are turning off the charge at some @xmath132 , violating charge conservation and in the process producing some photons .",
    "we are thus to handle this limit by remembering that @xmath56 is to be kept finite to the very end , and so we first mean @xmath136 . alternatively one can subtract the integral for the stationary particle , as in eq  [ [ stat ] ] to regularize the infrared behavior .    naturally if we use the form without the @xmath13 , say from eq  [ [ naau ] ] we immediately get zero for the stationary particle . more generally , we can investigate the contribution of the final and initial long straight paths for a moving particle in eq  [ [ naau ] ] .",
    "the dangerous regions for the infrared behavior are large @xmath93 as the particle comes from or goes to infinity . for both @xmath7 s very large or both very small",
    ", we have in view of eq  [ [ uu ] ] and @xmath137 that the numerator becomes @xmath138 .",
    "similarly if one @xmath7 is at very early times and the other a very late times and the velocities at these times are the same , there is the analogy to eq  [ [ uu ] ]    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the finite time period where the charge was not in uniform motion . for large @xmath141",
    ", @xmath142 and the numerator will again tend to zero , as long as the initial and final velocities are the same .",
    "it is interesting that the elimination of both the long and short distance singularities can in a sense be attributed to the same relation , eq  [ [ uu ] ] .",
    "consider that class of paths whose tangents are roughly parallel to some straight line on fig ( 1 ) , meaning that the ordinary velocity @xmath2 is always close to some typical or average velocity . by making a lorentz transformation ( under which @xmath1 is invariant ) so that this typical velocity is zero , we have as a first approximation in the ordinary velocity the non - relativistic limit , leading to expressions quadratic in velocities .",
    "we could make a stab at the non - relativistic limit by taking our basic expression eq  [ [ n ] ] and just naively expanding it for small velocities .",
    "we introduce @xmath143 , the average velocity vector connecting two points on the curve @xmath144 @xmath145 is a symmetric quantity @xmath146 , in parallel with our earlier definition of @xmath101 and becomes equal to @xmath2 when @xmath147 .",
    "@xmath145 plays a role analogous to @xmath101 except that it does not have a fixed length and so @xmath148 has non - zero time derivatives .",
    "expanding in eq  [ [ n ] ] we can try to write    @xmath149    where @xmath150 so that @xmath151    now , using eq  [ [ f1 ] ] the `` 1 '' term vanishes and we have      we have dropped the @xmath13 since the expression is non - singular with @xmath153 as @xmath147 .",
    "this is a not unreasonable - looking expression . indeed ,",
    "if we expand it for @xmath154 we get    @xmath155\\approx { 1\\over 4 } a^2 ( t - t')^2 ... \\ ; , \\ ] ]    showing that the singularity is cancelled and that the leading terms of the expression are positive and exhibit the familiar connection between acceleration squared and radiation .",
    "the ( ... ) includes terms involving time derivatives of the acceleration @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) as well as higher order terms in @xmath158 .",
    "one might have some qualms about the carefree @xmath13 manipulations , and we indicate how to arrive at eq  [ [ another ] ] by straightforward application of our more conventional formulas .    first note that @xmath101 can be written in terms of @xmath159 in the usual way relating a three - velocity and a four - velocity , @xmath160 with the non - relativistic limits @xmath161 .",
    "we find from either eq  [ [ aa ] ] or eq  [ [ aaa ] ] to leading order in @xmath159 @xmath162      taking the one - half the sum of the two forms we finally obtain , after much labor , eq  [ [ another ] ] . the cavalier @xmath13 manipulations were certainly a lot quicker !    despite the familiar acceleration squared in eq  [ [ asq ] ] , we should nt expect that @xmath1 can be represented simply by an integral of some local quantity along the path .",
    "there is the ( ... ) , and all our expressions are bi - local in the time .",
    "the photon is a non - local concept and a certain space - time interval is necessary to define it .",
    "this corresponds to the distinctive property of relativistic local field theory that while one has local constructions for quantities like charge density or energy density , there is in fact no local quantity for particle number or photon density .",
    "indeed , the need to have some space - time interval to define a particle , leads to the concept of the `` formation zone ''  @xcite , which can be used to understand certain phenomena like the absence of `` cascading '' for particle production on nuclear targets .",
    "with the simple eq  [ [ another ] ] in hand we can proceed to calculate a couple of concrete examples .    _",
    "dipole radiation : _ we first take the classic problem of dipole radiation . let a charged particle be oscillating in one dimension according to @xmath171 , so @xmath172 . changing variables @xmath173 and similarly for @xmath19 , eq  [ [ another ] ] becomes    @xmath174\\ ] ]    although the @xmath13 is not necessary since the combination of the two terms gives something non - singular , it is convenient to keep it since it allows us to handle each term separately . carrying out , say ,",
    "the @xmath18 integral first and using relations of the type @xmath175 or @xmath176 and @xmath177 , we arrive at @xmath178e^{-it'}=\\alpha ( x_0 \\omega)^2 { t\\omega\\over 3 } \\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the length of time the particle is in motion .",
    "the number of photons generated increases linearly with time , as was to be expected .",
    "we have neglected a contribution , not proportional to @xmath140 , connected with turning the motion on and off . if we now multiply by @xmath179 to find the energy and divide by t to get the power , we obtain @xmath180 , which is the classical formula for dipole radiation averaged over a cycle  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly we recover the classical result , as was our starting point .",
    "note however , that in general the energy radiated and the number of photons do not stand in direct relation since the oscillating charge produces higher harmonics in addition to the fundamental at frequency @xmath179  @xcite .",
    "however , in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath181 these higher harmonics become negligible ( since they are a retardation effect ) , and we expect the energy radiation to be simply proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "this example shows that despite our requirement that the initial and final velocities be equal , the method need not be of purely academic interest for practical calculations .",
    "if the effects connected with turning the motion on and off are negligible compared to some main effect , we can always return the particle to , say , zero velocity , while retaining the main effect .    instead of an oscillator which is on for a long time",
    "we can consider a charge undergoing a smooth deflection , for example @xmath182 so that @xmath183 .",
    "this leads to @xmath184={\\alpha\\over \\pi}({x_0\\over t_0})^2({-1\\over 8}\\pi^2-{- 3\\over 8}\\pi^2)={\\alpha \\pi\\over 4}({x_0\\over t_0})^2\\ ] ]",
    "eq  [ [ n ] ] should have some general symmetry properties with respect to changing the path .",
    "there are the evident invariances under lorentz transformations , translation , 3-d rotation , reflection , and time - reversal .",
    "since there are no dimensional quantities except the path itself involved , there is also an invariance under rescaling of all 4-coordinates simultaneously , @xmath185 .",
    "that is to say , if the path is expanded in space and time proportionally so that the velocities remain unchanged , @xmath1 is unchanged , as we see in the examples . it would be interesting to know if there are further invariances and what the full invariance group is .    also , we might consider the problem for gravitons instead of photons .",
    "presumably one will find , in analogy to eq  [ [ nn ] ] , and in view of the tensorial character of the source of gravitons , @xmath186 where g is the gravitational constant and @xmath187 the mass of the radiating particle ( recall @xmath188 , so @xmath189 ) , but it would be interesting to investigate this more closely .    finally , a number of interesting mathematical problems suggest themselves .",
    "our @xmath1 gives an invariant characterization of the `` wiggly - ness '' of a curve .",
    "there appears to be no reason why it should not be also used in euclidean space where @xmath190 .",
    "the main difference would seem to be that the curve can now go `` backwards '' , opening the possibility of closed curves .",
    "as well , there is the possibility of new singularities when two parts of the curve , with remote values of @xmath7 , come close together .    for a closed plane curve",
    "it is plausible that the minimum value of @xmath1 obtains for the circle . then defining @xmath191 ( we use eq  [ [ nabu ] ] , leave away @xmath192 , and the natural sign is now minus ) , we thus conjecture that the minimum value of @xmath1 for any plane curve is @xmath193 , which is what we obtain for the circle .",
    "also , there may be a `` topological '' aspect to @xmath1 , connected with knots .",
    "for an open path the minimum value of @xmath1 , namely zero , is reached for a straight line .",
    "if the path has a knot , however , it can not be continuously deformed to a straight line , and must go `` backwards '' somewhere , suggesting that the minimum value of @xmath1 continuously attainable is related to the presence of knots .",
