    "the propagation and continuous flow of information are of utter importance for the development of stable economies throughout the world as they are a prerequisite for successful business transactions , short- and long - range communication , and so on  @xcite .",
    "often this information has to be encrypted in such a way that it can be safely transferred between the sender and recipient without allowing others to read the information that is present in such an encrypted message  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "malicious persons and organizations , but also governmental organizations , are continuously striving to break the key with which messages were encrypted because this might enable them to get those pieces of information that are needed to achieve their criminal , protective , or other goals  @xcite .",
    "it is probably due to the impact of turing s success in breaking the enigma that humanity became aware of the importance of cryptography in general , and the vulnerability of ciphers more in particular  @xcite .    since this major breakthrough , the functioning of the industrial , financial and public sector has become strongly dependent on the advances of cryptography .",
    "for instance , while the availability of worldwide networks has enabled rapid dissemination of information , it has also stimulated cryptographic innovations because a significant share of this information may only be available to a few parties . in this manner , technological progress during the last decades has increased the need for secured communication and transactions , information shielding , and so on  @xcite .    in the last few decades , modern cryptography replaced mechanical schemes with new computing models .",
    "this modern focus influenced the classical design of ciphers far beyond the original purpose .",
    "nowadays , there are two class of cryptographic algorithms depending on the key : symmetric and asymmetric .",
    "symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext .",
    "this class of algorithm is also divided into two categories : stream ciphers and block ciphers .",
    "block ciphers have gained wide popularity since the introduction of the first adopted encryption : the data encryption standard ( des )  @xcite , in the mid-1970s , yet nowadays this cipher is considered prone to brute force attacks . to overcome this shortcoming the international data encryption algorithm ( idea )",
    "@xcite was designed in 1991 to replace des .",
    "ever since , there has been a pursuit for the development of new algorithms that meet the rising security expectations . in 1997 , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist )  @xcite selected the official advanced encryption standard ( aes ) among many competitors , namely serpent  @xcite , twofish  @xcite , rc6  @xcite , rijndael  @xcite , etc .    to date , block ciphers are the most important elements in many cryptographic systems  @xcite",
    ". a block cipher breaks a message into blocks of elements ( bits ) and then encrypts one block ( _ plaintext _ ) at a time producing its corresponding output block ( _ ciphertext _ ) .",
    "however , a block cipher by itself allows for the encryption of only one block , such that it is recommended to use a mode of operation in conjunction  @xcite .",
    "this mode of operation specifies a mechanism to improve the corresponding block cipher , while encrypting all of the blocks , one by one , as it goes along .    motivated by the analogies between cryptographic and dynamical systems , on the one hand , and the lack of a means to discriminate between different modes of operation that can be used to encrypt a message with a block cipher using a single key , on the other hand , we demonstrate in this paper how lyapunov",
    "exponents can be relied upon for tackling this problem . more specifically , by contemplating the whole of a cipher , ciphertext and key as an utter discrete dynamical system , _",
    "i.e. , _ a cellular automaton ( ca ) , and by resorting to the notion of lyapunov exponents as they have been conceived for such systems  @xcite , we show how these measures can be exploited to identify the mode of operation that was used during the encryption process .",
    "although the cryptographic process of encrypting and decrypting information does not constitute a dynamical system as such , it has been reported that it is possible to draw parallels between cryptographic and dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "hence , drawing upon such parallels , we have a means to exploit similar tools as the ones that have been conceived in the framework of dynamical systems in order to characterize cryptographic systems .",
    "taking into account that the stability of a dynamical system is generally acknowledged as its main characteristic because it gives insight into its intrinsic nature  @xcite , it is natural to verify whether the dynamical systems viewpoint of a cryptographic system allows for a similar notion in order to better understand the latter .",
    "an exploration of this is further motivated by the fact that several researchers have noticed a close resemblance between a cryptographic system on the one hand , and a chaotic system , on the other hand  @xcite , and the large number of chaos - based cryptosystems  @xcite .",
    "classically , the stability of a dynamical system is assessed by computing its so - called largest lyapunov exponent that quantifies how it behaves if it is evolved from two different but close initial conditions  @xcite . either the corresponding phase space trajectories diverge or converge in which case we refer to the system as unstable or asymptotically stable , respectively , or the system is conservative , which means that the initial separation remains .",
    "as the fields of cryptography and dynamical systems are not yet strongly interwoven , the basic definitions and concepts that relate to those systems and that are of interest within the framework of this paper are presented in section  [ pre ] , while the dynamical systems viewpoint on cryptographic systems is presented in section  [ method ] together with the proposed method for identifying the underlying mode of operation .",
    "finally , the strengths of the proposed method are illustrated and discussed in section  [ res ] by means of computer experiments .",
    "in this section we introduce the specificities of both cryptographic and dynamical systems that are indispensable for a clear understanding this paper .      classically , an encryption system encloses three major components , namely a cipher , a key , and finally , a ciphertext .",
    "the former constitutes a sequence of instructions that must be executed in order to encrypt a given plaintext , which may be envisaged as a sequence of @xmath0 bits , such that it can be represented as a boolean vector @xmath1 of length @xmath0 .",
    "the result of this encryption process using a key @xmath2 , which is a sequence of @xmath3 bits , is a so - called ciphertext , which may be represented in a similar fashion as a boolean vector @xmath4 of length @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "of course , the real plaintext size varies and is mostly different from the length of the blocks for which a block cipher is designed . consequently",
    ", common ciphers can not be applied directly for the encryption of arbitrary - length plaintext  @xcite . in order to overcome this issue ,",
    "so - called block ciphers have been designed and implemented .",
    "a block cipher slices the plaintext of length @xmath0 into @xmath5 blocks of @xmath6 bits , after which each of these blocks is encrypted / decrypted by a block cipher , denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "mathematically , the encryption of a plaintext @xmath9 of length @xmath6 into a ciphertext of the same length can be formalized as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . if the length @xmath0 of the plaintext is not a whole multiple of @xmath5 , additional bits are padded to the last block of the plaintext .",
    "these block ciphers encrypt a plaintext in accordance with a well - defined procedure , which is commonly referred to as the mode of operation of a block cipher .",
    "a block cipher encrypts one block at a time , and it is the mode of operation that allows a block cipher to encrypt blocks consecutively in a secure way .",
    "most of them use an initialization vector ( iv ) , denoted @xmath12 , which adds randomness to the encryption process  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the counter mode uses a special method for generating counters in order to guarantee that each block in the sequence is different from every other block  @xcite .    from the many block ciphers currently available",
    ", we will focus on the well - studied ones , being des  @xcite  ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , idea  @xcite , tea  @xcite and xtea  @xcite ( @xmath13 , @xmath15 ) , as well as aes  @xcite , rc6  @xcite , twofish  @xcite , serpent  @xcite , seed  @xcite and camellia  @xcite ( @xmath16 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the specifications of these block ciphers and the modes of operation are public , so they can be implemented  @xcite .    in 2001",
    "the nist compiled and recommended five modes of operation  most of them were developed 30 years ago  to be used with a block cipher , namely the electronic codebook ( ecb ) , cipher block chaining ( cbc ) , cipher feedback ( cfb ) , output feedback ( ofb ) , and counter ( ctr ) modes  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these nist modes , there are many others , among which the propagating cipher - block chaining ( pcbc )  @xcite mode will be considered in this paper .",
    "mathematically , the encryption of an arbitrary - length plaintext by means of a block cipher in combination with the ecb mode of operation can be formulated as :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 represents the encrypted counterpart of the @xmath19-th block of plaintext @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , the formalism for the cbc mode is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mod 2 operator and @xmath23 .",

    "recently , sundry methods have been developed to unravel the dynamical properties of utter discrete dynamical systems such as ca  @xcite .",
    "as such , by relying on these for grasping the dynamics of a cryptographic system s corresponding ca , we might be able to gain deeper insight into the dynamics of the former .",
    "more specifically , we will show in the remainder of this paper how lyapunov exponents of cas may be relied upon for identifying the mode of operation of the underlying cryptographic systems , in the same way as these measures have shown their usefulness for characterizing utter discrete dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "suppose that the ca counterpart of a given cryptographic system @xmath43 is denoted as @xmath44 .",
    "we can investigate the dynamics of the former in general , and its stability more in particular , by computing its so - called lyapunov exponent , which quantifies how the dynamical system behaves in the long run if it is evolved from two close initial conditions .",
    "clearly , in our setting , this means that we will assess the sensitivity of the equivalent ca @xmath44 to a small perturbation of the plaintext since we put @xmath45 .",
    "hence , this should yield insights into the behaviour of the cryptographic system if the plaintext is perturbed .    taking into account that the smallest possible perturbation in such a two - state setting boils down to flipping one bit of the first block of the plaintext @xmath1",
    ", @xmath46 constitutes the most influential block ( initial condition ) to the mode of operation .",

    "the discrepancy between the number of defective cells and the number of defects is not yet clear after the first time step because every defective cell at @xmath56 traces back to the same initial defective cell .",
    "however , as soon as the ca is evolved one more time step , a discrepancy emerges between these quantities .",

    "it is interesting to have a closer look at how nine defects can arise at the second time step in the evolution of the ca notwithstanding there are only five defective cells , which should be contributed to the fact that several of them may enclose multiple defects due to the existence of several pathways along which defects can propagate .",

    "the number of differences may be at most 8 , which is the length of the plaintext @xmath0 .",
    "this means that a defect in @xmath95 at the @xmath57-th time step can at most propagate to @xmath0 bits at the subsequent time step .",

    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex3 ] the procedure by which the le of a mode of operation @xmath38 can be assessed .",

    "note that some replicas are repeated as soon as the system is evolved for one time step , which is in agreement with the findings reported in fig .",
    "[ propdef ] .        in order to avoid having to keep track of all pathways individually",
    ", one can optimize the algorithm by just counting every unique replica once and keeping track of its multiplicity .",
    "for example , at @xmath98 the replica @xmath99 would be repeated twice , then at the subsequent time step this replica has two cell defects , which means four pathways in total at @xmath100 .",
    "as such , by tracking the multiplicity of every defect rather than every defect itself , the efficiency of the algorithm increases substantially .",
    "if the cryptographic system is sensitive to the plaintext from which it is evolved , the number of defects @xmath58 increases exponentially during its evolution , such that @xmath101 , and consequently , @xmath102 . on the other hand ,",
    "the system should be referred to as insensitive to the underlying plaintext if the initial defect vanishes as the number of time steps increases .",
    "such a situation implies that @xmath103 owing to the discrete nature of a ca s state space . since",
    "cryptographic systems are designed in such a way that small changes in the plaintext give rise to substantially differing ciphertexts , it should not come as a surprise if @xmath104 would be positive for all the modes of operation at stake in this paper . still , the numerically assessed values of @xmath88 might differ significantly among different block ciphers and/or underlying modes of operation , such that they may still be used to discriminate between different modes of operation .",
    "this usage will be illustrated in the following section .",
    "to demonstrate the effectivity of the above methodology , we considered two groups of block ciphers on the basis of their block length @xmath6 .",
    "the first group encloses the 64-block ciphers , namely des  @xcite , idea  @xcite , tea  @xcite and xtea  @xcite , which all use a @xmath105 key except for des that uses a key of length of @xmath14 bits .",
    "the second group of block ciphers is composed of 128-block ciphers with key of @xmath15 bits : aes  @xcite , rc6  @xcite , twofish  @xcite , serpent  @xcite , seed  @xcite and camellia  @xcite .",
    "these ten block ciphers were adapted in such a way that they took the plaintext @xmath1 , the key @xmath2 and the initialization vector @xmath12 as input variables . moreover ,",
    "these block ciphers were implemented with a predefined number of _ rounds _ , each of which consist of several inner steps in the course of an encryption process and they depend on the specific algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we considered eight rounds for idea , eighteen for des , and thirty - two rounds for both tea and xtea .",
    "further , ten rounds for aes , sixteen for both twofish and seed , eighteen for camellia and thirty - two for serpent .",
    "finally , we implemented the modes of operation in accordance with the formalism given by eqs .",
    " for ecb , cbc and ofb , and in table  [ modestab ] for cfb , ctr and pcbc",
    ".      to ensure the representativity of the computed lyapunov exponents , we computed the average @xmath104-values that were obtained when the cas were evolved from different plaintexts .",
    "hence , the @xmath104-values reported in the remainder represent averages calculated over an ensemble @xmath106 of 200 randomly generated plaintexts @xmath107 and their perturbed versions @xmath108 , which were obtained by flipping only one bit in the first block of @xmath107 .",
    "since such an ensemble was constructed for each of the concerned cryptographic systems , by mutually combining the underlying block cipher and the mode of operation , we considered a total of 60 combinations , _",
    "i.e. , _ ten block ciphers and six modes of operation . consequently",
    ", a total of 12000 plaintexts were generated randomly .",
    "similarly , the key @xmath2 and the initialization vector @xmath12 were generated randomly in order to avoid both key repetitions and weak keys , which is a recommendation in cryptography  @xcite . in the remainder",
    ", we refer to the assembly of the 200 randomly generated plaintexts , keys and initialization vectors as the cryptographic dataset per cipher and mode of operation .",
    "given that the block ciphers encrypt a plaintext by splitting it into a number of blocks and subsequently transcribing every block , the plaintexts were generated in such a way that they were composed of the same number of @xmath5 blocks , irrespective of the type of block cipher .",
    "note that this implies a plaintext containing @xmath109 bits in case of the 64-block ciphers and @xmath110 bits in case of the 128-block ciphers .",
    "thus , in order to compare @xmath104-values of 64- and 128-block ciphers , we normalized the numerically obtained @xmath104 with respect to @xmath96 obtained from eq .  ,      we assessed @xmath88 for the ca counterpart of each of the concerned cryptographic systems .",
    "for that purpose , the equivalent cas were evolved for @xmath111 time steps , which was sufficiently long because @xmath88 showed convergence in such a way that @xmath112 , being the maximum discrepancy between @xmath88 and @xmath113 at the end of the simulation .    furthermore the consistency of the @xmath104-values across the members of the different ensembles is also demonstrated in fig .  [ histodeltalog ] ( a ) , which depicts the frequency distribution of the standard deviation @xmath114 ( base 10 logarithm ) of @xmath115 calculated for the 60 cryptographic systems at stake .",
    "this histogram shows the similarity of @xmath104 across the different plaintexts , as the standard deviation that comes along with the average mle for the different cryptographic systems is obviously small .",
    "( base 10 logarithm ) of @xmath115 calculated over the 60 combinations of cryptographic systems .",

    "[ histodeltalog ] ( b ) shows a histogram of the discrepancies between the maximum and minimum observed mle among the members of the ensemble @xmath117 , denoted by @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119-values obtained for the investigated datasets lie between @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the maximum and minimum @xmath119 correspond , respectively , to the pairs of modes of operation with underlying block cipher : idea - ofb and serpent - cfb .",
    "all together , these small discrepancies demonstrate once more that the @xmath104-values are highly consistent across the different plaintexts within the ensemble @xmath117 , such that we may draw conclusions on their average values .    for simplicity , we mainly restrict our attention to idea and aes as representative members of the families of 64- and 128-block ciphers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ideaaes ] ) , respectively , since similar results were obtained for the other block ciphers in the same families ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : others ] ) .",
    "these figures depict the le curves for all the modes of operation versus the number of time steps  note that the standard deviation of each curve is not shown since they are very small . taking into account eq .  , the upper bound for the 64-block ciphers is @xmath122 , while it is @xmath123 for the 128-block ciphers were employed to normalize the @xmath104-values , respectively .",
    "c +         +    from both figures , it is quite easy to discriminate between the modes of operation , except for the overlapping curves of ctr and ofb .",
    "it is interesting to have a closer look at how their corresponding le increases almost exponentially during the first few time steps .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by reconsidering the equations in table  [ modestab ] .",
    "indeed , ctr uses an inner pseudo - random number generator and ofb uses a new initialization vector at every time step , such that the number of defective cells will not only increase due to discrepancies naturally emerging between the plaintexts , but also due to the additional defects introduced through these random processes . in contrast , cfb displays the opposite effect , _",
    "i.e. , _ its curve decays exponentially .",
    "further , the lyapunov exponents of ecb and pcbc are constant , since the number of defective cells grows proportionally through time .",
    "for instance , this behaviour can be explained by considering that ecb attains @xmath124 with the idea block cipher , which means that the number of defects @xmath125 equals approximately @xmath126 , being almost 50% of the block length .",
    "the same behaviour occurs for the aes block cipher , where @xmath127 .",
    "the original values of the exponents and standard deviation found at the end of the simulation are summarized in table  [ tab : mle2 ] .",
    "furthermore , we can discriminate between modes of operation in families of block ciphers not only by visual inspection of the graphs , but also by means of statistical tests to demonstrate it . paired",
    "t - tests revealed that there are statistically significant differences between ecb , cbc , cfb and pcbc mutually at the 5% significance level .",
    "however , no statistically significant difference was found between ctr and ofb .",
    "these observations were found in both families of 64- and 128-block ciphers , which also allows the proposed method to discriminate between modes of operation of different families , for instance , idea - ctr can be distinguished from aes - ctr .",
    "moreover , by means of the washer method  @xcite , we analyzed statistically whether a curve ( for one of the ensemble s members ) for a given mode falls within the envelope of curves obtained for the entire ensemble for another mode of operation .",
    "this procedure was repeated for all the curves within the given mode of operation at the 5% significance level , which indicated that at most 6.4% and 11.1% of the observations of the 64- and 128-block ciphers constituted outliers .",
    "these outliers exist at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "we can also notice that the cfb curve behaves completely different from the other ones ( non overlapping and not too close ) , which means that the cfb falls outside of the range of the le for the other modes of operation .      in this section , we will examine and discuss the preceding results in more detail .",

    "however , we observed that the position of the flipped bit does not affect the numerical value of the lyapunov exponent , which can be understood by recalling the theoretical upper bound on the lyapunov exponent of cryptographic systems .",
    "indeed , the encryption of the plaintext with a bit flipped at an arbitrary @xmath129 position at the first plaintext block ( @xmath130 ) may , in the worst case , affect all the bits of the ciphertext .

    "[ fig : ideaaes][fig : others ] it should be noticed that the normalized @xmath104-values do not attain 1 , because none of the cryptographic systems at stake is attaining the worst case scenario mentioned in section  [ method ] . this can be explained by the fact that this is an ideal and desirable `` scenario '' for cryptographic systems and that the block ciphers at stake have their limitations .",
    "furthermore , we found an unexpected phenomenon with regard to the families of 64- and 128-block ciphers . a closer look at the curves tied up with these families shows that , in fact , we can also differentiate between block cipher families .",

    "in particular , this indicates that irrespective of the number of blocks @xmath5 of the plaintext , the ecb s number of defects will attain approximately @xmath126 , which demonstrates that the first block is the only one affected by the initial conditions , while the other blocks do not spread defects .",
    "furthermore , we obtained the same results with both groups of 64- and 128-block ciphers and the six modes of operation .",

    "there is a strong relationship between cryptographic systems and discrete dynamical systems . in this work",
    "we have outlined an approach to envisage a cryptographic system as an equivalent one - dimensional ca in order to assess its stability characteristics by computing the lyapunov exponent of the cryptographic system .",

    "moreover , the proposed method is also capable of distinguishing between the two families of 64- and 128-block ciphers .",
    "the results showed that the lyapunov exponent evolution pattern is maintained for each mode of operation and this is independent of the block cipher used .",
