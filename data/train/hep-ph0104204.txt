    "determination of the various fundamental parameters of hadrons from experiments requires information about physics at large distance .",
    "unfortunately such information can not be achieved from the first principles of a fundamental theory of strong interactions because at large distance perturbation theory is invalid .",
    "for this reason , to determine properties of hadrons a reliable nonperturbative approach is needed . among all nonperturbative approaches ,",
    "qcd sum rules @xcite method is an especially powerful one in studying the properties low  lying hadrons . in this method ,",
    "deep connection between hadron parameters and qcd vacuum structure is established via a few condensates .",
    "this method is adopted and extended in many works ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the important characteristics of hadrons is their magnetic moment . the nucleon magnetic moment and the @xmath2 transition magnetic moment",
    "were calculated using the external field technique in framework of the qcd sum rules method , in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the aim of this letter is to calculate the @xmath2 transition magnetic moment in framework of an alternative approach to the traditional sum rules method , i.e. , light cone qcd sum rules ( lcqsr ) ( more about lcqsr method and its applications can be found in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that magnetic moment of the nucleons and decuplet baryons were studied in the lcqsr approach in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , the lcqsr for the @xmath3 magnetic moment is derived .",
    "3 is devoted to our numerical analysis and conclusion .",
    "for the determination of the @xmath4 transition magnetic moment in lcqsr , we consider the following two point correlation function :    [ 1 ] _ _ = i d^4 x e^i p x 0 t\\{_^0(x ) |_(0 ) } 0 _  , where @xmath5 is the time ordering operator , @xmath6 means external electromagnetic field and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the interpolating currents with @xmath0 and @xmath1 quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "it is well known that there is a continuum of choices for the baryon interpolating current .",
    "the general form of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 currents can be written as @xcite : _ ^0 & = & 2 _ _ 1 + t^__2  , + _ ^0 & = & 2 _ _ 1 + t _ _ 2  , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are arbitrary parameters and _ _ 1 & = & _ abc  , + _ _ 2 & = & _ abc  , + _ _ 1 & = & _ abc  , + _ _ 2 & = & _ abc  , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are color indices .",

    "( [ 19])-([21 ] ) ) .",
    "two criteria should be met by the mass sum rules .",

    "only the ratio is considered and it was found that the ratio stabilizes at @xmath90 , but as we have already noted , this value is not in the physical region .",
    "our analysis shows that , the most appropriate value of @xmath9 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined through the relation @xmath93 .",

    "one should also note that the ioffe current , which corresponds to the choice @xmath96 , is also not in the appropriate region .    in fig .",
    "( 2 ) the dependence of the transition magnetic moment on @xmath97 at @xmath98 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is depicted .",
    "a reasonable value for the transition magnetic moment must be obtained far from the unphysical region .",
