    "the robust confirmation of the existence of neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite , thanks to the milestone discovery of neutrino oscillations in propagation from solar , atmospheric , accelerator , and reactor neutrino sources , has opened a window to probe new physics beyond the standard model ( sm )  ( for the relevant experimental references see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the ultimate origin of neutrino mass remains a mystery  @xcite , oscillation results have motivated a plethora of sm extensions to generate small neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "a generic feature of such models is the existence of nontrivial neutrino electromagnetic ( em ) properties  @xcite .",
    "although the three - neutrino oscillation paradigm seems to be on rather solid ground  @xcite , nontrivial neutrino electromagnetic properties may still play an important subleading role in precision neutrino studies @xcite .",
    "the lowest - order contribution of neutrino em interactions involves neutrino magnetic moments ( nmm )  @xcite , as well as the neutrino charge radius  @xcite arising from loop - level radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "note that a direct neutrino magnetic moment measurement could provide a key insight in the understanding of the electroweak interactions , and the majorana nature of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in contrast to the case of majorana neutrinos , only massive dirac neutrinos can have non - vanishing diagonal magnetic moments  @xcite . in the general majorana case , only off - diagonal transition magnetic moments exist , they form an antisymmetric matrix , calculable from first principles , given the underlying gauge theory .    within the minimally extended model with dirac neutrino masses , one expects tiny nmm , of the order of @xmath1 , expressed in bohr magnetons @xmath2",
    "however , appreciably larger majorana neutrino transition magnetic moments are expected in many theoretical models , such as those involved with left - right symmetry  @xcite , scalar leptoquarks  @xcite , r - parity - violating supersymmetry  @xcite , and large extra dimensions  @xcite . currently , the most stringent upper limits , @xmath3  few  @xmath4 , come from astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are bounds from measurements by various terrestrial neutrino scattering experiments .",
    "the present status of such constraints is summarized in table  [ table : constraints ] where one can see that the direct constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath6 are still rather poor .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that currently operating reactor neutrino experiments such as texono and gemma have set robust constraints on @xmath7 .",

    "we first examine the sensitivity of the coherent experiment to the weak mixing angle @xmath10 of the sm in the low energy regime of the sns operation . in order to quantify this sensitivity , assuming that the experimental proposal will measure exactly the sm prediction , we perform a statistical analysis based on a @xmath0 with statistical errors only @xmath11 where the number of sm events , @xmath12 , depends on the coulomb nuclear matrix element entering the coherent rate . as the central value for the sm weak mixing angle prediction we adopt the pdg value @xmath13 .",
    "we then compute the @xmath0 function depending on the expected number of events for a given value of the mixing angle , @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding results for the various detector materials of the coherent experiment are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.sw ] . in table",
    "[ table.sw ] , we illustrate the band , @xmath15 , at 90% c.l . evaluated as @xmath16 and the corresponding uncertainty @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the upper and lower @xmath20 error , respectively . at the optimistic level ,",
    "our results indicate that better sensitivities are expected for heavier target nuclei , such as @xmath21xe .",
    "this is understood as a direct consequence of the significantly larger number of expected events provided by heavier nuclear isotopes  @xcite . however , once we consider the realistic case , the expectations change drastically so that , for the case of a @xmath22ge detector we find a better sensitivity , due to a closer location to the sns source ( @xmath23  m in comparison with the @xmath24  m for the @xmath21xe case ) and a higher efficiency in recoil acceptance ( see table [ table_consept ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in fig . [ fig.sw2 ] and table [ table.sw2 ] ,",
    "we show that the expected sensitivities improve through a combined measurement of the prompt and delayed beams ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "one of the main goals of our present work is to examine the sensitivity of the coherent experiment to the possible detection of cenns events due to neutrino em effects , associated with various effective transition nmm parameters such as @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the total number of events expected in an experiment searching for cenns depends strongly on the energy threshold @xmath28 as well as the total mass of the detector . for low energy thresholds and more massive detectors ,",
    "the total number of events expected is significantly larger and , therefore , the attainable constraints are more stringent .",
    "we remind the reader that , for a possible nmm detection , a very low energy threshold is required , since the em cross section dominates at low energies .",
    "the sensitivity is evaluated by assuming that a given experiment searching for cenns events , will measure exactly the sm expectation ; thus any deviation is understood as a signature of new physics . following  @xcite we define the @xmath0 function as @xmath29 by employing the aforementioned method , we find that the coherent experiment could provide useful complementary limits on @xmath30 . on the other hand , the sensitivity to @xmath27 ,",
    "is not expected to be as good as that of reactor experiments  @xcite . however , a combined analysis of the prompt and delayed muon - neutrino beams ( @xmath31 ) , could help to further improve the sensitivity to a neutrino magnetic moment .",

    "<S> we focus on the potential of the recently planned coherent experiment at the spallation neutron source to probe muon - neutrino magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting sensitivities are determined on the basis of a @xmath0 analysis employing realistic nuclear structure calculations in the context of the quasiparticle random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that they can improve existing limits by half an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that these facilities allow for standard model precision tests in the low energy regime , with a competitive determination of the weak mixing angle . </S>",
    "<S> finally , they also offer the capability to probe other electromagnetic neutrino properties , such as the neutrino charge radius . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our results for various choices of experimental setup and target material . </S>"
