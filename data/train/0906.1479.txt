    "the motivation to investigate @xmath9 quark decays is attributed to their sensitivity to the quark flavor structure , which leads to an extremely rich phenomenology , studied mostly in the context of @xmath10-meson decays .",
    "however , heavy baryons containing a @xmath9-quark have been observed at the tevatron and they will be even more copiously produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "their weak decays may provide important clues on the flavor - changing currents beyond the standard model ( sm ) in a complementary fashion to the @xmath10 meson decays .",
    "a particular advantage of the bottom baryons over @xmath10-mesons is their spin , which provides a unique way to analyze the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian for the weak transition in the sm and beyond .",
    "also , such baryon decays are flavor self - tagging processes which should make their experimental reconstructions easier .",
    "theoretical analysis of non - leptonic decays are based on factorization theorems , which are the fundamental tools of the qcd perturbation theory enabling the separation of physics at different energy scales .",
    "the theoretical basis of the factorization theorem is a generalization of the euclidean operator product expansion to the time - like domain .",
    "the proof of the factorization theorem has been worked out using the perturbative qcd approach based on the analysis of feynman diagrams in the so called collins - soper - sterman ( css ) formalism @xcite .",
    "equally importantly , the large mass of the heavy quark makes the formidable strong interactions effects controllable and they can be studied systematically using methods based on heavy quark expansion .",
    "the basic formula for the calculation of the branching ratios for the decays of the @xmath8 baryon into two light hadrons is based on an operator realization of the diagrammatic analysis which can be described most easily for the calculation of the hadronic matrix element of @xmath10 mesons decays into two light hadrons @xmath11 and @xmath12 . with the insertion of a set of the weak interaction operator @xmath13 between the initial @xmath10 meson and the final decay products @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", the decay matrix element is obtained from the following formula  @xcite @xmath14 involving the qcd form factor @xmath15 and an unknown , non - local form factor @xmath16 at the leading power in the @xmath17 expansion .",
    "different treatments of the various parts in the factorization formula ( [ ff - scet ] ) have led to three popular theoretical approaches to study the dynamics of non - leptonic two - body @xmath10 meson decays , which are known as the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite , qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite and scet approaches  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath16 is supposed to be dominated by perturbative hard - collinear interactions , and can be further factorized into light - cone distribution amplitudes @xmath18 , @xmath19 and a jet function @xmath20 @xmath21 when the hard - collinear scale @xmath22 is integrated out @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these two latter approaches based on the collinear factorization theorem , the pqcd approach , which is developed in the framework of @xmath4 factorization , is free of the singularities from the end - point region of the parton momentum fractions .",
    "the pqcd approach has been widely applied for the calculation of the non - leptonic two - body @xmath10 decays and it has proved itself to be successful in the description of exclusive processes with typical momentum - transfer of a few @xmath23 .",
    "a hallmark of this approach is that the form factor @xmath24 is assumed to be dominated by short - distance contributions and it is therefore calculable in the perturbative theory .",
    "soft contributions , though playing a role , are less important because of the suppression from the sudakov mechanism embedded in the @xmath4 and threshold resummations  @xcite .",
    "current applications of the @xmath4 factorization theorem to exclusive processes are restricted to the leading order ( lo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath1 . in this , the infrared divergences involved in the radiative corrections to the weak transition vertex are absorbed in the hadronic distribution amplitudes in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "the factorizable , non - factorizable and power - suppressed annihilation contributions are calculable in this framework free of the end - point singularities .    in the case of non - leptonic",
    "two - body @xmath10 decays , the decay matrix elements , in most cases , are dominated by the factorizable term , i.e. the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ff - scet ] ) , whereas the second term , the non - factorizable one , produces a perturbative correction .",
    "since the first term proportional to the form factor @xmath25 is in pqcd very similar to the other approaches , where the form factors are input , the pqcd approach gives in most cases similar results for the non - leptonic @xmath10 decays as the other two approaches mentioned above , though there are differences in detail .    in the application of pqcd to two - body non - leptonic",
    "heavy baryon decays , we do not expect a similar pattern as in the non - leptonic @xmath10 meson decays on general grounds .",
    "in particular , in the analysis of the hadronic decays of baryons , a large number of feynman diagrams contribute to the hard amplitudes even in the lowest - order .",
    "taking the @xmath26 decay as an example , some 200 feynman diagrams need to be calculated as can be seen in section  [ ff - feynman - diagrams ] .",
    "these diagrams involve the exchange of two gluons , involving topologies where both gluons are attached to one of the light quarks emerging from the weak interaction vertex .",
    "as some of these diagrams build up the transition form factor , they receive contributions in @xmath27 , yielding small values for them .",
    "another challenge for the baryonic transition is that the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of the baryons are less known in the literature .",
    "lcdas are fundamental non - perturbative input to regularize the infrared divergence appearing in the radiative corrections in the factorization formalism of the pqcd approach . in view of this , applications of the pqcd approach to non - leptonic two - body @xmath9-baryon decays are not worked out to a satisfactory level , and hence this area is essentially an uncharted territory .",
    "a first attempt to apply the pqcd approach to the baryonic transitions was made in  @xcite , where the proton dirac form factor is calculated taking into account the sudakov suppression resulting from the resummation of the large double logarithms involved in the radiative corrections .",
    "subsequently , the proton form factor was recalculated in @xcite by refining the choice of the evolution scale of the proton wave functions and the infrared cutoffs for the sudakov resummation , which lead to predictions for the dirac form factors which are consistent with the experimental data .",
    "following refs .",

    "our aim is to fill in this gap and provide further tests of the @xmath4 factorization formalism to gain insight on the qcd dynamics of these decays . in doing this , we have included the current information on the ckm matrix elements , updated some input hadronic parameters , such as the distribution amplitudes of the proton , which are systematically studied in @xcite making use of the conformal symmetry of the qcd lagrangian , and have used data to fix some other input quantities .",
    "we find that the non - factorizable contributions to the hard amplitudes overwhelm the ones from the factorizable diagrams in the baryonic decays @xmath33 .",
    "this feature of the @xmath9-baryonic decays is at variance with what is found in the naive factorization approximation and in the corresponding two - body @xmath10 meson decays .",
    "large non - factorizable effects existing in the charmed baryon decays have been pointed out in the literature @xcite , where it is observed that the non - factorizable diagrams escaping from the helicity and color suppression can be comparable to and sometimes even dominate over the factorizable contributions .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the pqcd approach and give the essential input quantities that enter this approach , including the operator basis used subsequently and the lcdas for the pseudoscalar mesons , the proton as well as the @xmath8 baryon .",
