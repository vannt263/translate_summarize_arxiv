    "as cmb anisotropy experiments have gotten more ambitious , our need for powerful statistical methods has become more urgent . for the cmb data sets that have been obtained up to now , including cobe @xcite ( _ dmr4 _ ) , the 1994 south pole data of @xcite ( _ sp94 _ ) and the 1993 - 95 saskatoon data of @xcite ( _ sk95 _ ) , which we analyze jointly here , it is possible to do a relatively complete bayesian statistical analysis if the primary anisotropies are assumed to be gaussian and the non - gaussian galactic foregrounds are not large . even for these experiments , this is feasible only because of compression , in which the data set is acted upon by linear operators which project it onto subspaces of the full data . in the past",
    "the linear combinations of the data were defined by what made intuitive sense ( weighted sums of different frequency channels or weighted averages of pixel separations below the beam scale ) , and could still leave too many pixels to deal with in a complete analysis . here",
    "we use the rigorous signal - to - noise eigenmode approach to data compression @xcite to reduce the sets to the manageable @xmath4 important combinations .",
    "as we approach the era of megapixel data sets promised by map and cobras / samba , via the era of tens of thousands of pixels promised by long duration balloon experiments , the question of how to come as near to optimal compression as possible given computer limitations becomes of paramount importance .",
    "this happy day of too many pixels is now upon us .",
    "the goal is to estimate the parameters @xmath5 of a target set of theories with angular power spectra @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the cmb power spectrum as usually defined and the @xmath8 are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature fluctuations for the theoretical signal . ] by first determining the likelihood function @xmath9 for each theory , and then comparing the likelihoods as a function of the parameters . using bayes theorem ,",
    "we can write the probability of the theoretical parameters , given the observations and the class of theories being tested , @xmath10 , where the assumed prior probability distribution @xmath11 can reflect _ a priori _ maximal ignorance , or take into account constraints from other information such as large scale structure observations . the proportionality constant is related to the probability that the class of theories is correct given the observations . to give preferred values and errors for a specific cosmological parameter of interest such as the hubble parameter ,",
    "one often integrates ( marginalizes ) over the other parameters , such as the density fluctuation power amplitude on cluster scales , @xmath12 , and the primordial density fluctuation spectral index @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    ", we assume the inflationary model for structure formation with gaussian adiabatic ( scalar ) density perturbations and possibly gravitational wave ( tensor ) perturbations .",
    "we explore constraints in the parameter space @xmath14 .",
    "we assume reheating occurs sufficiently late to have a negligible effect on @xmath15 .",
    "the total density parameter , @xmath16 , is expressed in terms of the densities in baryonic cold , hot and vacuum matter , of which @xmath17 can cluster .",
    "the age of the universe is @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is a function of @xmath22 , so one parameter is redundant .",
    "the scalar and tensor tilts are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . , apart from small corrections .",
    "this determines the level of tensor anisotropies compared with scalar .",
    "the tensor tilt is related to the deceleration parameter @xmath25 of the universe during inflation by @xmath26 plus small corrections . here , we take one of two cases . ( no - gw case ) : @xmath27 , thus no gravity wave contribution ( for nearly critical acceleration , @xmath28 , as in natural inflation ) .",
    "( gw case ) : @xmath29 if the scalar tilt is negative ( subcritical but nearly uniform acceleration ) and @xmath27 if the scalar tilt is positive . ] with current errors on the data , this space is too large for effective parameter estimation . instead we restrict our attention to various subregions , such as @xmath30 , where either @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a function of @xmath21 or @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath18 s we choose are ( 11 , 13 , 15  gyrs ) with @xmath35 , but @xmath31 .",
    "for these cases , the `` standard '' nucleosynthesis value @xmath36 was chosen .",
    "we constrain @xmath37 , @xmath38 . for @xmath31 models , we have roughly @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 . a recent estimate for globular cluster ages",
    "is @xmath41 @xcite . for the case @xmath33 ,",
    "we have also let @xmath42 vary , over the range @xmath43 , and we have also done a limited exploration of the 13 gyr , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , space with tilt , using @xmath46 from bond and souradeep .",

    "the curves are very similar if we allow for a mix of hot and cold dark matter with the same @xmath51 as these cdm models , and the other parameters fixed .",
    "the solid dark curve is the `` standard '' untilted cdm model .",
    "the bandpowers for the three experiments analyzed here , _ dmr4 _ , _ sp94 _ , _ sk95 _ , are the darker heavier data points . because of the differing angular scales involved we gain a long lever arm with which we can constrain cosmological parameters more strongly than with any individual experiment .",

    "we are given the data in the form of a measured mean @xmath52 of the anisotropy in the @xmath53th pixel , along with the variance about the mean @xmath54 for the measurements .",
    "in general , there are pixel ",
    "pixel correlations in the noise , defining a correlation matrix @xmath55 with off - diagonal components as well as the diagonal @xmath56 .",
    "also there is usually more than one frequency channel , with the generalized pixels having frequency as well as spatial designations .",
    "the theoretical signal also has a correlation matrix , @xmath57 , which is a linear combination of a product of the @xmath6 times a `` window function matrix '' @xmath58 encoding the possibly frequency - dependent beam , the chopping strategy , sky coverage , for the experiment : @xmath59 $ ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the `` window function '' usually reported for an experiment is @xmath60 .",
    "the likelihood function is @xmath61 here @xmath62 denotes transpose .",
    "the noise correlation matrix @xmath63 consists of the pixel errors @xmath64 and the correlation of any unwanted residuals @xmath65 , such as galactic or extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "one can think of @xmath65 as increasing the noise for selected correlation patterns in the medium . with a large enough noise in these patterns , they are effectively projected out from the data .",
    "constraints such as averages , gradients ( dipoles , quadrupoles ) and known spatial templates , which may be frequency dependent ( iras or dirbe combined with appropriate extrapolations ) can also be modelled in the total @xmath66 , as `` nuisance variables '' to be integrated ( marginalized ) over . denoting each constraint @xmath67 on pixel @xmath53 by @xmath68 , where the template for constraint @xmath67 is @xmath69 and the amplitude is @xmath70 , we need only replace @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : likenc ] ) by @xmath71 , then integrate over the amplitudes @xmath70 , assuming some prior probability distribution .",
    "this is most easily done if we assume the @xmath70 are distributed as very broad gaussians , reflecting our ignorance of their values ( or , if we know their likely range , incorporating that as prior information in the gaussian spreads ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath70 then yields eq.([eq : likenc ] ) with the residual noise matrix given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the assumed prior variance for the constraint amplitudes . as the eigenvalues of @xmath74 become very large ,",
    "the effect of the constraint matrix is to project onto the data subspace orthogonal to that spanned by @xmath69 .",
    "although one can directly use the likelihood equation in this projection limit ( using @xmath75 for the constraint prior ) , it is computationally simpler to use the gaussian prior .",
    "( taking into account constraints with amplitudes that are not linear multipliers times the template is much more complex . ) a suitable @xmath65 can also allow us to focus attention only on a specified band in @xmath76-space for power spectrum estimation .",
    "in practice , we do not compute the quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 $ ] directly ; instead we go to a basis ( linear combination of the data ) in which @xmath79 and @xmath80 are diagonal .",
    "first , we whiten the noise matrix using the nonorthogonal transformation provided by its `` hermitian square root , '' @xmath81 ; we apply the same transformation to @xmath79 and diagonalize this in turn with the appropriate matrix of eigenvectors , @xmath82 : @xmath83 , which has units of @xmath84 .",
    "we then transform the data into the same basis , @xmath85 , now in units of @xmath86 .",
    "the transformed theory matrix @xmath87 still depends on the theoretical amplitude ( @xmath12 , etc . ) as a simple multiplier , which enables the likelihood to be easily calculated as a function of this parameter . in the new basis ,",
    "the noise and signal have diagonal correlations and @xmath88 , so @xmath89 is useful as a theory - dependent @xmath90 power spectrum which gives a valuable picture of the data and shows how well the target theory fares ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snmode])@xcite .",
    "the modes are sorted in order of decreasing @xmath90-eigenvalues , @xmath91 , so low @xmath92-modes probe the theory in question best .",
    "this expansion is a complete ( unfiltered ) representation of the map .",
    "the optimal method for data compression is to use sharp signal - to - noise filtering , keeping only those high @xmath90 modes with @xmath93 and deleting low @xmath90 ones .",
    "we also find it extremely useful to look carefully at the power in the low @xmath90 modes to determine whether further residuals need to be added to the generalized noise : a poor model for the noise can give false indications of what the data is saying and misrepresent the signal .",
    "filtering using @xmath90-modes has a long history in signal processing where it is called the karhunen - loeve method @xcite , and it is now being widely adopted for analysis of astronomical databases . for an all - sky experiment with uniform , uncorrelated pixel variances , the eigenmodes are the spherical harmonics , and the eigenvalues the expected coefficients @xmath8 . for a more complicated experiment , the high-@xmath90 modes probe the peak of the experiment s window function in @xmath76-space .",
    "low-@xmath90 modes are more complex . for experiments with more than one frequency channel",
    ", differences between channels should show no cmb signal , and so the eigenvalue should be @xmath94 .",
    "nearby pixels , oversampling the beam , should also show very little signal  the smooth fall from high @xmath90 to low traces the beam in much the same way that the window function falls as a gaussian @xmath95 $ ] at high @xmath76 .",
    "we expect these low @xmath90 modes to be largely independent of the theory used to calculate the appropriate @xmath79 , which enables these modes to be used as a diagnostic of both the analysis procedure and the experiments themselves .",
    "we now discuss the anisotropy experiments we use .",
    "the six cobe / dmr four - year maps @xcite are first compressed into a ( a+b)(31 + 53 + 90 ghz ) weighted - sum map , with the customized galactic cut advocated by the dmr team , basically at @xmath96 but with extra pixels removed in which contaminating galactic emission is known to be high , and with the dipole and monopole removed .",
    "galactic coordinate pixels are used ; slight differences arise with ecliptic coordinate pixels . although one can do full bayesian analysis with the map s @xmath97 pixels , this `` resolution 6 '' pixelization of the quadrilateralized sphere is oversampled relative to the cobe beam size , and there is no effective loss of information if we do further data compression by using `` resolution 5 '' pixels , @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the weighted sum of channels is an exact use of our optimal signal - to - noise compression .",
    "the resolution degradation is not optimal but is nearly so ( @xmath99 is nearly constant for separations @xmath100 below the scale of the beam , so adjacent pixel differences have tiny signal but the usual data - noise ) .",
    "the galactic cut is also not optimal , but could be made so by using explicit templates for galactic foregrounds to include in @xmath80 , as described above .",
    "the combined effect reduces the pixel number from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "further compression by a factor of two or so is possible without much information loss @xcite . a strong indication of the robustness of the _ dmr _ data set is the insensitivity of the band - powers to the degree of signal - to - noise filtering and to which frequencies are probed . for @xmath65 ,",
    "we include templates for the monopole , dipole and quadrupole , the latter allowing for a galactic foreground contaminant , which we know is there at low @xmath76 in the 31 ghz channel .",
    "the dmr data probes @xmath103 well , with useful information out to @xmath104 .",
    "the _ sp94 _",
    "experiment @xcite is similar to a classic single - differencing chopping experiment , except that differencing is associated with the oscillation of the beam about the pixel position .",
    "it probes @xmath105 .",
    "the number of frequency channels and spatial pixels is sufficiently small ( 301 ) that no compression is needed : all 7 frequencies in the ka and q bands at @xmath106 and @xmath107 ghz are simultaneously analyzed .",
    "there are 14 constraints , average and gradient removals for each frequency .",
    "taking differences in @xmath108 in frequency at the same spatial position is insensitive to the primary signal but has the usual pixel noise for each channel , so @xmath90 filtering would tend to remove those modes and strong compression would result . because the beams do vary somewhat with frequency , however",
    ", the compression would remove some information , unlike for cobe .",
    "the _ sk95 _",
    "experiment @xcite probes a much larger band in @xmath76-space , from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "even before the data was delivered to us a significant amount of frequency and spatial compression already took place . in this paper , for parameter estimation , we use the `` cap '' data ( 2016 pixels , including rebinned data from _ sk94 _ , with 48 constraints associated with average removals ) .",
    "the sk experiment measured the temperature directly by making slightly - curved radial scans from the north celestial pole about 8 degrees in length , which covered the cap as the earth rotated .",
    "the data was binned in ra , but , instead of binning in declination , it was projected in software onto what are in effect 3 to 19 beam `` chopping '' configurations .",
    "adding the ring data to the cap , involving sweeps in a ring around the ncp at @xmath111 brings the total to 2400 pixels , with 52 constraints . in @xcite",
    ", we show that the `` cap '' and `` cap+ring '' parameter estimates agree to much better than `` one sigma '' even though the ring adds substantially more data .",
    "one potential concern is that only one hemt band is represented in the data .",
    "we have also extensively analyzed the sk94 data set on its own @xcite , with 1344 pixels and 28 constraints , which has only 3 to 9 beam template projections and substantially fewer hours of integration than the 94 + 95 data , but the advantage of having both ka and q band information so the frequency spectrum can be checked .",
    "we agree with @xcite that the spectrum of the sk94 3 to 9 templates is consistent with a cmb origin , and inconsistent with likely galactic foregrounds .",
    "( we come to the same conclusion for the _ sp94 _ data , in agreement with @xcite . )",
    "sk95 had data only from the q - band . in analyzing sp94 and sk94 - 95 , it is essential to include errors in the overall calibration of @xmath112 . for sk94 - 95",
    "it is estimated to be a gaussian with standard deviation @xmath113 ; for sp94 , @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 denote the calculated likelihood assuming no such errors ; then the likelihood with the uncertainty included is @xmath116{\\cal l}_0(\\sigma_8^\\prime ) $ ] .",
    "it is unfortunate that after all of the effort that has gone into these superb experiments , an astronomical issue like the brightness of cas a ( for sk95 ) results in a substantially poorer constraint on @xmath12 than one obtains assuming no such calibration uncertainty .",
    "as we mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] , we have chosen to order our path through parameter - space using the cosmological age of the models , @xmath18 . to examine the phenomenology of the experiments we shall use a one - parameter sequence of @xmath15 shapes , with the overall bandpower of the experiment ( or the related @xmath12 ) as another parameter . while it was usual in the past to use a power law in @xmath117 , @xmath118 @xcite ,",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : cl13gyr ] that this would be a very bad fit to the _ sk95 _ data , although it is a reasonable representation over the limited @xmath76 range for both the",

    "the @xmath90-eigenmodes also provide a form of data compression which can drastically reduce the required analysis time . by rotating to a basis in which some `` canonical theory '' with correlation matrix @xmath131",
    "is diagonalized by the matrix @xmath132 , but only retaining some fraction of the modes , we efficiently remove parts of the data dominated by noise ( modes with very low @xmath133 ) , but retain the gaussian character of the likelihood for the remaining modes . for other theories ,",
    "the transformed theory matrix @xmath134 will no longer be diagonal , so the full matrix calculation must still be performed , but now on the smaller space of observations restricted to the modes with the highest `` canonical '' @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , for these theories , the @xmath90-modes will be somewhat different , so the compression will not be as efficient ( we will have thrown out a bit `` more signal and less noise '' ) .",
    "still , we have achieved compression as good as 90% for experiments",
    "( like sk94 ) with two channels and 65% for the full sk94 - 95 dataset , which has already been re - binned to remove some of the redundancy in beam oversampling and channel - to - channel differences . because the cost of the matrix calculations involved scales as @xmath135 , these result in significant speedups : from @xmath136  hour to @xmath137  minutes per point in parameter space for _ sk95 _ ( which is actually significantly worse than the expected @xmath138 speedup due to overhead ) .    in fig .",

    "contours @xmath141 are very similar as well .",
    "thus we can achieve significant degrees of compression without loss of information . in the following ,",
    "we apply no data compression to the analysis of the dmr and sp data , but for sk95 we present results using the top 700 modes from the canonical standard cdm theory , the @xmath49 model in the @xmath128  gyr sequence .",

    "( the bins require a certain signal - to - noise when summed , but a minimum number are required to define a bin so that the error bars are not too large . )",
    "the error bars contain both variances associated with the pixel noise and with the theoretical cosmic variance ( noise - noise , noise - signal and signal - signal terms ) . to be a good fit to the data , the error bars should pass through the theory curve .",
    "after the top few hundred modes , the eigenvalues have @xmath133 so we do not expect them to contribute significantly to the likelihood .",
    "we emphasize that it is legitimate to use any mode subset : the relative likelihoods we obtain will tell us which theory is preferred for those modes .",
    "it is just that we do not want to build any prior prejudice for a theory by compressing the data in a way which may be biased in its favour over the other theories we are testing .",
