    "the notion of information theoretic secrecy was first introduced by shannon in his seminal work @xcite . applying the notion of information theoretic secrecy to channel models with single transmitter , single receiver , and single eavesdropper ( wiretapper )",
    "was pioneered by wyner @xcite , csiszar and korner @xcite , and leung - yan - cheong and hellman @xcite .",
    "wyner @xcite , introduced the wiretap channel where it is assumed that the received signal by the eavesdropper is a degraded version of the signal received by the legitimate receiver . for his model , wyner established the secrecy capacity region , which is defined as the region of all simultaneously achievable rates and equivocation - rates . in @xcite , the secrecy capacity region was established for the general case where the eavesdropper s channel is not necessarily a degraded version of the main receiver s channel . in particular , it was shown that to achieve the secrecy capacity region of the single user wiretap channel , channel prefixing may be necessary . in channel prefixing ,",
    "an auxiliary random variable serves as the input of an artificially created prefix channel , whose output is used as the input to the original wiretap channel . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that , through plain gaussian signaling alone , i.e. , without channel prefixing , one can achieve the secrecy capacity of the gaussian wiretap channel .",
    "the multiple access wiretap channel ( mac - wt ) was introduced in @xcite . in mac - wt ,",
    "multiple users wish to have secure communication with a single receiver , in the presence of a passive eavesdropper .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite focus on the gaussian mac - wt , and provide achievable schemes based on gaussian signaling .",
    "reference @xcite goes further than plain gaussian signaling and introduces a technique ( on top of gaussian signaling ) that uses the power of a non - transmitting node in jamming the eavesdropper .",
    "this technique is called _ cooperative jamming_. cooperative jamming is indeed a channel prefixing technique where specific choices are made for the auxiliary random variables @xcite . in addition ,",
    "cooperative jamming is the first significant application of channel prefixing in a multi - user gaussian wiretap channel that improves over plain gaussian signaling .",
    "more recently , reference @xcite showed that for a certain class of gaussian mac - wt , one can achieve through gaussian signaling a secrecy rate region that is within 0.5 bits of the secrecy capacity region .",
    "consequently , there has been some expectation that secrecy capacity may be obtained for gaussian mac - wt through i.i.d .",
    "gaussian signaling , potentially with gaussian channel prefixing .    however , a notable shortcoming of these gaussian signaling based achievable schemes is that rates obtained using them do not scale with the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . in other words ,",
    "the total number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) for the mac - wt achieved using these schemes is zero .",
    "this observation led to the belief that these schemes , and hence gaussian signaling ( with or without channel prefixing ) , may be sub - optimal .",
    "this belief is made certain as a direct consequence of the results on the secure dof of gaussian interference networks that were obtained in several papers , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in particular , in each of @xcite and @xcite , it was shown that positive secure dof is achievable for a class of vector gaussian interference channels ( i.e. , time - varying channels where channel state information is known non - causally ) which in turn implies that positive secure dof is achievable for the vector gaussian mac - wt . in @xcite and @xcite , it was shown that through structured coding ( e.g. , lattice coding ) , it is possible to achieve positive dof for a class of scalar ( i.e. , non - time - varying ) gaussian channels with interference that contains the gaussian mac - wt .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , an achievable secrecy rate region for the @xmath1-user gaussian mac - wt was obtained by incorporating a new alignment technique known as real interference alignment .",
    "this technique performs on a single real line and exploits the properties of real numbers to align interference in time - invariant channels .    fading gaussian mac - wt",
    "was first considered in @xcite where the gaussian signaling and cooperative jamming schemes which were originally proposed in @xcite and @xcite are extended to the fading mac - wt . using these schemes",
    ", @xcite gave achievable ergodic sum secrecy rates for the fading mac - wt .",
    "similar to the non - fading setting , these achievable ergodic secrecy rates do not scale with the average snrs . in this paper , we propose two new achievable schemes for the fading gaussian mac - wt . our first achievable scheme , the _ scaling based alignment _ ( sba ) scheme ,",
    "is based on code repetition with proper scaling of transmitted signals . in particular , transmitters repeat their symbols in two _ consecutive _ symbol instants .",
    "transmitters further scale their transmit signals with the goal of creating a full - rank channel matrix at the main receiver and a unit - rank channel matrix at the eavesdropper , in every two consecutive time instants .",
    "these coordinated actions create a two - dimensional space for the signal received by the legitimate receiver , while sustaining the interference in a single - dimensional space at the eavesdropper .",
    "in other words , code repetition with proper scaling of the transmit signals at each transmitter _ aligns _ the received signals at the eavesdropper perfectly making it difficult for the eavesdropper to decode both messages .",
    "consequently , we obtain a new achievable secrecy rate region for the two - user fading mac - wt .    in another recent work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in a fading interference channel , by code repetition over _ properly chosen _ time instants , one can perfectly cancel interference at each receiver so that the resulting individual rates scale as @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the rate reduction by a factor of @xmath2 comes with the benefit of perfect interference cancellation . in this paper",
    ", we extend the ergodic interference alignment concept to a secrecy context and we propose another achievable scheme which we call _ ergodic secret alignment _ ( esa ) . in the sba scheme , code repetition is done over two consecutive time instants , while in the esa scheme , we carefully choose the time instants over which we do code repetition such that the received signals are aligned favorably at the legitimate receiver while they are aligned unfavorably at the eavesdropper .",
    "in particular , given some time instant with the vector of the main receiver channel coefficients and the vector of the eavesdropper channel coefficients given by @xmath3^t$ ] and @xmath4^t$ ] , respectively , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the symbols transmitted in this time instant by users @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , our objective , roughly speaking , is to determine the channel gains we should wait for to transmit @xmath5 and @xmath6 again . in this paper , we show that , in order to maximize achievable secrecy rates , we should wait for a time instant in which the main receiver channel coefficients are @xmath9^t$ ] and the eavesdropper channel coefficients are @xmath10^t$ ] .",
    "consequently , we obtain another achievable secrecy rate region for the two - user fading mac - wt .    for both proposed schemes ,",
    "we show that the resulting secrecy rates scale with snr .",
    "specifically , the achievable secrecy sum rate scales as @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we show that the secrecy rates achieved through i.i.d . gaussian signaling with cooperative jamming in fading mac - wt do not scale with snr .",
    "the significance of these results is that , they show that indeed neither plain i.i.d . gaussian signaling nor i.i.d .",
    "gaussian signaling with cooperative jamming is optimal for the fading mac - wt , and that , for high snrs , one can achieve higher secrecy rates by aligning interference perfectly in the eavesdropper mac while reducing , or cancelling , interference at the main receiver mac using some coordinated actions at both transmitters that involve code repetition , i.e. , a form of time - correlated ( non i.i.d . ) signaling .",
    "in fact , the achievable rate region using the second scheme , the esa scheme , involves two significant improvements over the one achieved by the sba scheme when the channel coefficients are circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variables .",
    "first , the expressions for achievable rates by the sba scheme involve products of the squared magnitudes of the channel coefficients .",
    "the squared magnitudes of the channel coefficients are exponential random variables and hence multiplying them will intuitively make the small values of their product occur with higher probability and the large values occur with lower probability .",
    "this in effect reduces the achievable rates by the sba scheme . on the other hand , the achievable secrecy rates by the esa scheme do not have this drawback .",
    "in other words , by code repetition , the sba scheme creates two ( not perfectly ) correlated mac channels to the main receiver and two perfectly correlated mac channels to the eavesdropper , while the esa scheme creates an orthogonal mac channel to the main receiver and two perfectly correlated mac channels to the eavesdropper .",
    "this fact leads to higher achievable secrecy rates by the esa scheme .",
    "the second improvement of the esa scheme with respect to the sba scheme is that the average power constraints associated with the esa scheme do not involve any channel coefficients whereas those associated with the sba scheme involve the gains of the eavesdropper channel which in turn result in inefficient use of transmit powers .",
    "in addition , we introduce an improved version of our second scheme in which we use cooperative jamming on top of the esa scheme to achieve higher secrecy rates .",
    "moreover , since the rate expressions achieved by the esa scheme ( with and without cooperative jamming ) and their associated average power constraints are simpler than their counterparts in the sba scheme , we derive the necessary conditions on the optimal power allocations that maximize the sum secrecy rate achieved by the esa scheme when used alone and when used together with cooperative jamming .",
    "since the achievable secrecy sum rate , in general , is not a concave function in the power allocation policy , the solution of such optimization problem may not be unique .",
    "hence , we obtain a power allocation policy that satisfies the necessary ( but not necessarily sufficient ) kkt conditions of optimality .    finally , we provide numerical examples that illustrate the scaling of the sum rates achieved by the proposed schemes with snr and the saturation of the secrecy sum rate achieved by the i.i.d .",
    "gaussian signaling scheme with cooperative jamming .",
    "we also give numerical examples for the secrecy sum rates achieved by the esa scheme with and without cooperative jamming when power control is used .",
    "we consider the two - user fading multiple access channel with an external eavesdropper .",
    "transmitter @xmath12 chooses a message @xmath13 from a set of equally likely messages @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "every transmitter encodes its message into a codeword of length @xmath16 symbols . the channel output at the intended receiver and the eavesdropper",
    "are given by @xmath17 where , for @xmath15 , @xmath18 is the input signal at transmitter @xmath12 , @xmath19 is the channel coefficient between transmitter @xmath12 and the intended receiver , @xmath20 is the channel coefficient between transmitter @xmath12 and the eavesdropper .",
    "we assume a fast fading scenario where the channel coefficients randomly vary from one symbol to another in i.i.d .",
    "also , we assume the independence of all channel coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . each of the channel coefficients is a circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable with zero - mean .",
    "the variances of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we assume that all the channel coefficients are known to all the nodes in a causal fashion . in ( [ a1])-([a2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the independent gaussian noises at the intended receiver and the eavesdropper , respectively , and are i.i.d .",
    "( in time ) circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variables with zero - mean and unit - variance .",
    "moreover , we have the usual average power constraints @xmath31&\\leq \\bar{p}_k,\\quad k=1,2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "here we summarize previously known results that are relevant to our development . for the general discrete - time memoryless mac - wt , the best known achievable secrecy rate region @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is given by the convex hull of all rate pairs @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 where the distribution @xmath34 factors as @xmath35 .    known secrecy rate regions for the gaussian mac - wt can be obtained from these expressions by appropriate selections for the involved random variables .",
    "for instance , the gaussian signaling based achievable rates proposed in @xcite are obtained by choosing @xmath36 and @xmath37 , i.e. , no channel prefixing , and by choosing @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be gaussian with full power . on the other hand ,",
    "cooperative jamming based achievable rates proposed in @xcite are obtained by choosing @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and then by choosing @xmath40 to be independent gaussian random variables @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 carry messages , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 are jamming signals .",
    "the powers of @xmath45 and @xmath46 should be chosen to satisfy the power constraints of users 1 and 2 , respectively .",

    "the ergodic secrecy rate region achieved by gaussian signaling and cooperative jamming for the fading mac - wt can be expressed similarly by simply including expectations over fading channel states @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52^t$ ] , @xmath53^t$ ] , and the instantaneous powers @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are both functions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , satisfy @xmath56&\\leq \\bar{p}_k,~k=1,2 \\label{concj1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we introduce a new achievable scheme for the fading mac - wt . our achievable scheme is based on code repetition with proper scaling of the signals transmitted by each transmitter .",
    "this is done as follows . for the channel described in ( [ a1])-([a2 ] )",
    ", we use a repetition code such that each transmitter repeats its channel input symbol twice over two _ consecutive _ time instants . due to code repetition",
    ", we may regard each of the macs to the main receiver and to the eavesdropper as a vector mac composed of two parallel scalar macs , one for the _ odd _ time instants and the other for the _ even _ time instants .",
    "consequently , we may describe the main receiver mac channel by the following pair of equations @xmath57 where , for @xmath15 , @xmath58 are the coefficients of the @xmath12th main receiver channel in odd and even time instants , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the received signal and the noise at the main receiver in odd and even time instants . in the same way , we may describe the eavesdropper mac channel by the following pair of equations @xmath61 where , for @xmath15 , @xmath62 are the coefficients of the @xmath12th eavesdropper channel in odd and even time instants , @xmath63 and @xmath60 are the received signal and the noise at the eavesdropper in odd and even time instants .",
    "since all the channel gains are known to all nodes in a causal fashion , the two transmitters use this knowledge as follows . in every symbol instant , each transmitter scales its transmit signal with the gain of the other transmitter s channel to the eavesdropper .",
    "that is , in every symbol duration , the first user multiplies its channel input with @xmath24 , the channel gain of the second user to the eavesdropper , and the second user multiplies its channel input with @xmath23 , the channel gain of the first user to the eavesdropper .",
    "hence the main receiver mac can be described as @xmath64 and the eavesdropper mac can be described as @xmath65 it is clear from ( [ y_o])-([y_e ] ) that the space of the received signal ( without noise , i.e. , high snr ) of the main receiver over the two consecutive time instants is two - dimensional almost surely . in other words ,",
    "the channel matrix of the main receiver vector mac is full - rank almost surely .",
    "this is due to the fact that the channel coefficients are drawn from continuous bounded distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear from ( [ z_o])-([z_e ] ) that the channel matrix of the eavesdropper vector mac is unit - rank .",
    "that is , the two ingredients of our scheme , i.e. , code repetition and signal scaling , let the interfering signals at the main receiver live in a two - dimensional space , while they _ align _ the interfering signals at the eavesdropper in a one - dimensional space . as we will show in the section  [ dof_section",
    "] , these properties play a central role in achieving secrecy rates that scale with snr .",
    "finally , we note that , due to signal scaling at the transmitters , the average power constraints become @xmath66 \\leq \\bar{p}_{1}\\label{cons1 }   \\\\    & e\\left[\\left(|g_{1o}|^2+|g_{1e}|^2\\right)p_2\\right ] \\leq \\bar{p}_{2}\\label{cons2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are functions of the channel gains , are the instantaneous powers of users 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "now , we evaluate the secrecy rate region achievable by our _ scaling based alignment _ ( sba ) scheme . given the vector channels ( [ y_o])-([y_e ] ) and ( [ z_o])-([z_e ] ) , the following secrecy rates are achievable @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xmath69 \\label{r - mi-1}\\\\    r_2 & \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\left[i(x_2;y_o , y_e|x_1,\\textbf{h},\\textbf{g})-i(x_2;z_o , z_e|\\textbf{h},\\textbf{g})\\right ] \\label{r - mi-2}\\\\    r_1+r_2 & \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\left[i(x_1,x_2;y_o , y_e|\\textbf{h},\\textbf{g})-i(x_1,x_2;z_o , z_e|\\textbf{h},\\textbf{g})\\right ] \\label{r - mi - sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these expressions for achievable rates follow from ( [ ach1])-([achsum ] ) by treating channel states as outputs at the receivers , and noting the independence of channel inputs and channel states .",
    "we note that the factor of @xmath70 on the right hand sides of ( [ r - mi-1])-([r - mi - sum ] ) is due to repetition coding .",
    "now , by computing ( [ r - mi-1])-([r - mi - sum ] ) with gaussian signals , we obtain the secrecy rate region given in the following theorem .",

    "after we have devised the scaling based alignment scheme , the ergodic interference alignment scheme of nazer _ et .",
    "@xcite inspired us to propose an improved achievable scheme . in this section",
    ", we discuss this scheme which we call _ ergodic secret alignment _",
    "the new ingredient in this scheme is to perform repetition coding at two _ carefully chosen _ time instances as opposed to two _ consecutive _ time instances as we have done in section  [ sba_scheme ] .    for the mac - wt described by ( [ a1])-([a2 ] )",
    ", we use a repetition code in a way similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we repeat each code symbol in the time instant that holds certain channel conditions relative to the those conditions in the time instant where this code symbol is first transmitted .",
    "namely , given a time instant with the main receiver channel state vector @xmath52^t$ ] and the eavesdropper channel state vector @xmath53^t$ ] , where the symbols @xmath5 and @xmath6 are first transmitted by the two transmitters , we will solve for the channel states @xmath79^t$ ] and @xmath80^t$ ] , where these symbols should be repeated again , such that the resulting secrecy rates achieved by gaussian signaling are maximized .",
    "due to code repetition , we may regard each of the macs to the main receiver and to the eavesdropper as a vector mac composed of two parallel scalar macs , one for each one of the two time instants over which the same code symbols @xmath5 and @xmath6 are transmitted .",
    "consequently , we may describe the main receiver mac channel by the following pair of equations @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the received symbols and the noise at the main receiver in the two time instants of code repetition . in the same way",
    ", we may describe the eavesdropper mac channel by the following pair of equations @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the received symbols and the noise at the eavesdropper in the two time instants of code repetition .    in the next theorem",
    ", we give another achievable secrecy rate region for the two - user fading mac - wt .",
    "the achievable region is obtained using ( [ r - mi-1])-([r - mi - sum ] ) and replacing @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , and evaluating these expressions with gaussian signals , and by choosing optimal @xmath91 and @xmath92 to maximize the achievable rates .",
    "in particular , we choose the repetition instants , i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , in such a way that the parallel mac to the main receiver is the most favorable from the main transmitter - receiver pair s point of view , and the parallel mac to the eavesdropper is the least favorable from the eavesdropper s point of view . as we will show shortly as a result of theorem  [ main - res ] , this optimal selection will yield an _ orthogonal _ mac to the main receiver and a _ scalar _ mac to the eavesdropper . in writing the achievable rate expressions ,",
    "we will again account for code repetition by multiplying achievable rates by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "[ main - res ] for the two - user fading mac - wt , the rate region given by all rate pairs @xmath32 satisfying the following constraints is achievable with perfect secrecy @xmath95 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the power allocation policies of users @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and are both functions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in general .",

    "observe that as in @xcite , @xmath93 must be chosen such that it has the same distribution as @xmath54 and @xmath94 must be chosen such that it has the same distribution as @xmath55 . since @xmath97 and @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 , then @xmath93 and @xmath94 must be in the form @xmath101 and @xmath102 where the unitary matrices @xmath103 and @xmath104 must further be of the form : @xmath105 and @xmath106 for some @xmath107 .",

    "our second scheme , the ergodic secret alignment ( esa ) scheme , is inspired by the ergodic interference alignment technique . in this scheme",
    "each transmitter repeats its symbols over carefully chosen time instants such that the interfering signals from the transmitters are aligned favorably at the main receiver while they are aligned unfavorably at the eavesdropper .",
    "we obtained the secrecy rate region achieved by this scheme and showed that , as in the scaling based alignment scheme , the secrecy sum rate achieved by the ergodic secret alignment scheme scales with snr as @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , we introduced an improved version of our esa scheme where cooperative jamming is used as an additional ingredient to achieve higher secrecy rates .",
    "moreover , since the rate expressions achieved with the sba scheme seem complicated , while the rate expressions achieved with the two versions of the esa scheme ( with and without cooperative jamming ) are more amenable for optimization of power allocations , we derived the necessary conditions for the optimal power allocation that maximizes the secrecy sum rate achieved by the esa scheme when used solely and when used with cooperative jamming .",

    "<S> in this paper , we introduce two new achievable schemes for the fading multiple access wiretap channel ( mac - wt ) . in the model that we consider </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that perfect knowledge of the state of all channels is available at all the nodes in a causal fashion . </S>",
    "<S> our schemes use this knowledge together with the time varying nature of the channel model to align the interference from different users at the eavesdropper perfectly in a one - dimensional space while creating a higher dimensionality space for the interfering signals at the legitimate receiver hence allowing for better chance of recovery . </S>",
    "<S> while we achieve this alignment through signal scaling at the transmitters in our first scheme ( scaling based alignment ( sba ) ) , we let nature provide this alignment through the ergodicity of the channel coefficients in the second scheme ( ergodic secret alignment ( esa ) ) . for each scheme , we obtain the resulting achievable secrecy rate region . we show that the secrecy rates achieved by both schemes scale with snr as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we show the sub - optimality of the i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian signaling based schemes with and without cooperative jamming by showing that the secrecy rates achieved using i.i.d . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian signaling with cooperative jamming do not scale with snr . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we introduce an improved version of our esa scheme where we incorporate cooperative jamming to achieve higher secrecy rates . moreover , we derive the necessary optimality conditions for the power control policy that maximizes the secrecy sum rate achievable by our esa scheme when used solely and with cooperative jamming . </S>"
