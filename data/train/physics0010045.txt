    "we are led to a comparison between discrete time and continuous time systems .",
    "our main result from the comparison is that in dynamic fitness landscapes , continuous and discrete time systems have qualitative differences in the low mutation rate regime .",

    "a two concentration approximation has proven useful to describe situations with @xmath75  @xcite but is not applicable here , since we are particularly interested in the case @xmath73 , for which the average landscape is flat in continuous time and acquires a hole in discrete time .",

    "we find that the expansions give reliable results for small mutation rates , but start deviating from the true value as @xmath4 approaches @xmath84 .",
    "note that both expansions must break down beyond @xmath84 , as both the discrete and the continuous propagator assume unphysical negative values on the diagonal when @xmath4 exceeds @xmath84 [ eqs .   and ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : app - vs - ex ] , it is evident that there exists a qualitative difference between the discrete and the continuous time system . in the system with continuous time , the sequences stay centered around the currently active peak for arbitrarily small but non - zero mutation rates , whereas in the system with discrete time , the sequence distribution becomes ever more homogeneous as @xmath85 .",
    "the behavior of the discrete system is easily explained . in the geometric mean of the landscape ,",
    "the peak position is actually disadvantageous , and hence the population is driven into the remaining genotype space , which it occupies homogeneously due to the lack of selective differences .",
    "formally , the population feels the geometric mean only for a vanishing mutation rate .",
    "however , by continuity , the disadvantage at the peak position will remain for some small but non - zero @xmath4 , which leads to the continuous decay of the order parameter as @xmath85 .",
    "interestingly , the order parameter does not decay exactly to zero , but to a value slightly below zero .",
    "this happens because the population becomes homogeneously distributed over the whole sequence space except for the position of the oscillating peak .",
    "the resulting small imbalance in the sequence distribution towards the opposite end of the boolean hypercube then leads to a negative order parameter .",

    "for an infinitesimal @xmath86 , the dependence of the asymptotic state on the initial condition is lost , as we know from the frobenius - perron theorem . since for @xmath87",
    "the evolution of the population in time steps of size @xmath67 is guided by the flat average landscape , one might suspect that for infinitesimal @xmath86 a homogeneous distribution is found as the unique asymptotic state .",
    "this is what we observe for a population evolving in a flat static landscape with little mutation .",
    "however , the situation in a dynamic landscape may be different , because the dynamics of the landscape has a significant influence on the asymptotic sequence distribution .",
    "in fact , it is possible that a flat average landscape leads to an ordered asymptotic state for finite mutation rates @xmath88 . in the next subsection",
    ", we will demonstrate this effect for the oscillating sharp peak .",
    "we will now have a closer look at the oscillating sharp peak landscape , eq .  .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath73 , which leads to a degenerate average in continuous time .",
    "first we note some general properties of the monodromy matrix @xmath89 for a periodic landscape with flat arithmetic mean .",
    "if @xmath89 is given to first order in @xmath74 , it reads ( assuming the average fitness is 1 ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 is independent of the mutation rate @xmath4 and contains only the off - diagonal entries from eq .  .",
    "since @xmath91 differs from @xmath89 only by a scalar factor and an additional constant on the diagonal , the eigenvectors of the former matrix are identical to the ones of the latter matrix , while the eigenvalues are related through @xmath92 . as a consequence , we find that the asymptotic species distribution is given by the principal eigenvector of the off - diagonal matrix @xmath91 , which is independent of @xmath4 . if we took terms up to the @xmath93th order of @xmath4 into account in eq .",
    ", we would find the higher order contributions to the eigenvectors up to @xmath94th order of @xmath4 .",
    "however , with our first - order approximation , we are only able to calculate the asymptotic sequence concentrations to 0th order in @xmath4 .    for small mutation rates @xmath4 , we can restrict our analysis to the first three error classes .",
    "for the oscillating peak , we find with help of eq .",
    "the following expressions @xmath95 where    @xmath96e^{\\xi|\\phi-1/2|}\\,\\\\ \\beta_{\\phi}(\\xi)&=e^{\\xi/2}e^{-2\\xi|\\phi-1/2|}\\,\\\\ \\xi & = a t\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ( unnormalized ) asymptotic state follows as @xmath97 now , if the third error class concentration is negligibly small compared to the other two concentrations , the concentrations of the higher error classes can be neglected as well , and the asymptotic state is approximately given by the concentrations of the first two error classes only . from eq .  , we can derive the following criterion for this approximation to be valid , @xmath98 hence , if @xmath99 is large , which means that the fitness fluctuations are large and slow , the population is exclusively distributed over the peak and the first error class . for this case",
    ", we find the following simplified description of the population :    [ eq : approx ] @xmath100\\,,\\\\ x_{1}(\\phi,\\xi)&=\\sqrt{l\\beta_{\\phi}(\\xi)}\\big/\\left[1+\\sqrt{l\\beta_{\\phi}(\\xi)}\\right ] \\,,\\\\",
    "m_{s}(\\phi,\\xi)&=1 - 2x_{1}(\\phi,\\xi)/l\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the last equation implies that in the limit @xmath101 , the order parameter is always larger than @xmath102 .",
    "this means that although the peak does not have an average selective advantage , the evolving sequences are attracted to the peak nonetheless .",
    "as long as @xmath103 , the order parameter averaged over one oscillation cycle is _ positive _ , which means that a population can draw a selective advantage from being close to the peak in comparison to being far away from it .    in figure",
    "[ fig : approx]a , we display the predicted behavior of the system in a very small mutation rate , as given by eq .  .",
    "the observed change in the sequence concentrations is explained as follows . during the times at which the peak has above - average fitness",
    ", the sequences on the peak replicate faster than all others and hence grow exponentially until the peak s concentration saturates around one , while all off - peak sequences assume vanishing concentrations . similarly , during the times at which the peak has below - average fitness , the peak s relative concentration decays , while the population moves onto the nearest advantageous sequences , which can be found in the first error class .",
    "the sequences in all other error classes are adaptively neutral compared to the first error class . hence",
    ", the amount of sequences that move into higher error classes is solely determined by the mutation rate . if the mutation rate is small enough , the diffusion among these neutral sequences becomes negligibly small on the time scale of the peak oscillations @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the population stays mainly within the first error class until the peak fitness switches back to the above - average value .",
    "thus , we find the qualitative behavior of eq .  : in a landscape with a large and slowly oscillating sharp peak and a small mutation rate , the population oscillates between the peak sequence and the first error class in the asymptotic state . in short ,",
    "the population becomes localized close to the peak .",
    "for extremely small mutation rates , eq .",
    "agrees perfectly with the full numerical solution . for somewhat larger mutation rates ,",
    "the main discrepancy that arises is a phase shift between the full solution and the approximation ( figure  [ fig : approx]b ) .",
    "the phase shift moves the concentration curves towards earlier times , i.e. , the system becomes more responsive to the changing peak as the mutation rate increases .",
    "this is intuitively clear . with a higher mutation rate , the first error class",
    "will already be occupied to a larger extent when the peak switches to the below - average value , so that the concentration of the one - mutants can grow faster towards their equilibrium value .",
    "similarly , when the peak switches back to the above - average value , the peak sequences have a more favorable initial concentration , which makes them grow faster in comparison to a lower mutation rate .",
    "let us shortly extend the above argumentation to broader peaks , like peaks with linear flanks of width @xmath104 : @xmath105\\big\\}\\quad\\mbox{for all $ 0<i\\le l$}.\\ ] ] the sharp peak from above corresponds to a peak of width @xmath106 . for arbitrary chosen width @xmath104 ,",
    "the population gets transported to the @xmath107th error class due to the selection pressure during the below - average peak fitness phases .",
    "the @xmath107th error class is in that case the boundary of the advantageous region .",
    "again , if the mutation rate is sufficiently small , diffusion can be neglected and the population will stay in the @xmath107th error class until the peak fitness switches back to the above - average value .",
    "this implies that for peaks of width @xmath108 , it is possible to have @xmath109 for some intermediate oscillation phases .",
    "in particular for the maximum width @xmath110 , the order parameter @xmath111 will oscillate symmetrically around zero .    in this subsection ,",
    "we have only considered continuous time systems .",
    "we have established that in a dynamic fitness landscape with flat average , a population can draw a selective advantage from peaks that fluctuate around the average fitness value . the same effect will occur in a discrete time system if we consider the geometric mean of the fitness landscape instead .",
    "in other words , in a landscape with flat geometric mean , a population with a small mutation rate will draw a selective advantage from a peak that fluctuates around that geometric mean .",
    "the origin of that effect is again the vanishing diffusion , which causes the population to remain close to the peak when the peak has a height below the mean .",
    "when discussing the discrete system in sec .  [ sec : zero - mutrate ] and  [ sec : nonzero - mutrate ] , we have set @xmath24 , i.e. , we have made the assumption that every sequence can generate offspring only once , and dies before the next generation starts to replicate .",
    "the opposite extreme is @xmath112 , for which no sequence ever dies . with @xmath112 ,",
    "a sequence can theoretically stay infinitely long in the system ( in practice , the growth of new sequences is compensated through an out - flux of old sequences , but that is not our concern here .",

    "@xcite to what extend the discrete approximation behaves qualitatively different from the continuous system .",

    "let us just consider the zeroth order term , @xmath117 compare this expression to eqs .   and  . for @xmath112 , we neither have the exponential of the averaged landscape , nor do we have an expression that depends solely on the geometric mean of the landscape .",
    "we obtain a mixture between the two cases , and the size of @xmath17 determines which case we are closer to .",
    "consequently , we obtain qualitatively wrong results from the discrete approximation if the arithmetic and geometric mean of the landscape differ significantly .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancies between the results can be restricted to arbitrary small values of the mutation rate if we choose @xmath17 small enough .    as an example , consider fig .",
    "[ fig : alt - master - op ] . there",
    "we display the order parameter in the oscillating sharp peak landscape obtained from the full continuous propagator , and compare it to the result from the discrete approximation for various values of @xmath17 . for a relatively large @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , eq .",
    "gives a poor approximation of the continuous system . throughout the whole range of @xmath4",
    "there are significant deviations from the full solution .",
    "as we decrease @xmath17 ( increase @xmath39 ) , the approximation moves much closer to the true value of the order parameter .",
    "yet , for very small @xmath4 , the order parameter always decays to zero in the approximation , whereas it stays close to one in the full solution .",
    "however small we choose @xmath17 , there will always be some contribution from the geometric mean at @xmath58 .",
    "that causes the order parameter in the discrete approximation to vanish for this particular landscape .    contrasting to above situation",

    "if time is updated continuously , an evolving population adapts for @xmath85 to the exponential of the average fitness landscape , whereas in discrete time , the population adapts to the geometric mean of the landscape .    if the arithmetic or the geometric mean of the fitness landscape have degeneracies , then the behavior of the respective continuous time or discrete time system for @xmath85 is determined by the effect of the landscape on the population for some small but finite @xmath4 , which can be very different from its effect for @xmath120 . in particular , for the case of a slowly oscillating peak , the growth of the population onto the peak when the peak is high is much faster than the diffusion away from the peak when the peak is low , which implies that a population can draw a selective advantage from that peak _ even _ if the average ( resp .",
    "geometric mean ) height of the peak does not exceed the surrounding landscape . from that observation ,",
    "the following picture emerges : if the average height of a slowly oscillating peak is larger than or equal to the surrounding fitness landscape , than in a small mutation rate environment a population will draw a selective advantage from being close to the peak position .",
    "only if the average height is truly smaller than the surrounding fitness , the peak position will be necessarily disadvantageous .",
    "the differences that we have found between continuous time and discrete time systems are not only interesting from a modeling perspective .",
    "they also have implications for the evolution of organisms that have the ability to influence their replication cycle . in a fluctuating environment , a strain that feels the average of the landscape will have a selective advantage over a strain that feels the geometric mean , as the latter is generally smaller . hence ,",
    "if two strains are identical apart from the fact that one replicates in a synchronized manner ( all individuals generate their offspring at the same time , every @xmath17 units of time ) , whereas the other one replicates unsynchronized ( at any point in time , some individuals may generate offspring ) , then the unsynchronized strain will out - compete the synchronized strain .    throughout this paper , we have exclusively considered infinite populations .",
    "it is quite likely that finite populations experience the arithmetic or geometric mean fitness just as infinite populations do .",
    "however , since finite population sampling occurs at every time step , the sampling might well interfere with the averaging , such that finite populations could experience a somewhat different landscape .",
    "nevertheless , the effect that a fluctuating peak can lead to a selective advantage will also exist in a finite population . with a small mutation rate ,",
    "the finite population will not drift away from the peak when it is below average , and hence the population will most likely rediscover the peak when it rises again to above average .",
