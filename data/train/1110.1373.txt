    "our motivation to consider polygonal light - like wilson loops in 3d chern - simons and @xmath3 superconformal chern - simons ( abjm ) theory @xcite stems from the wilson loop / scattering amplitude duality in @xmath0 super yang - mills .    in planar @xmath4 super yang - mills @xmath1-particle mhv scattering amplitudes @xmath5",
    "are related to the expectation value of the @xmath1-cusped wilson loop operator @xmath6 the contour of the @xmath1-sided polygon @xmath7 is given by @xmath1 points @xmath8 @xmath9 which are related to the massless particle momenta via @xmath10 .",
    "the segments of the contour are thus light - like , i.e. @xmath11 .    the relation between the wilson loop and the scattering amplitude is given by    @xmath12    this duality was discovered in the dual @xmath13 string picture at strong gauge coupling in @xcite and shown to exist also in the weak coupling regime @xcite with profound consequences on the symmetries of these correlators leading to a dual superconformal @xcite respectively yangian symmetry @xcite of scattering amplitudes , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "for a rieview of ads / cft integrability see @xcite .    it was found that the expectation value of the wilson loop in @xmath4 super yang - mills is governed by an anomalous conformal ward identity that completely fixes its form at 4 and 5 points and allows for an arbitrary function of conformal invariants starting from 6 points .",
    "this so - called remainder function @xmath14 is indeed present starting from 6 points and leads to a correction @xcite , @xcite of the bds ansatz @xcite for planar gluon scattering amplitudes .",
    "recently , the duality has been extended to amplitudes with arbitrary helicity states by introducing a suitable supersymmetric wilson loop @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a duality between light - like wilson loops with @xmath1 cusps and @xmath1-point correlation functions of half - bps protected operators in the limit where the positions of adjacent operators become light - like separated was established in @xcite .    from the string perspective",
    "the scattering amplitude / wilson loop duality in the @xmath15 system arises from a combination of bosonic and fermionic t - dualities under which the free @xmath13 superstring is self - dual @xcite .",
    "hence , for the existence of an analogue duality in abjm theory one would require a similar self - duality of the @xmath16 superstring under the combined t - dualities .",
    "the problem was analysed in @xcite but no t - self - duality could be established so far .    at tree - level",
    ", recent developments have uncovered yangian and dual superconformal symmetry of the amplitudes in abjm theory @xcite . in @xcite a vanishing result for the four - point one - loop amplitudes in abjm theory was found and the authors speculated whether the two - loop scattering amplitudes in @xmath17 chern - simons could be simply related to the one - loop @xmath0 yang - mills amplitudes .    in @xcite we calculated the expectation value of the wilson loop operator in the planar limit for light - like polygonal contours @xmath7 in pure chern - simons and abjm theory .",
    "conformal ward identities force @xmath18 to depend only on conformally invariant cross ratios of the @xmath19 . at one - loop order in pure chern - simons and abjm",
    "theory we found that the correlators with four and six cusps vanish , leading to the conclusion that the allowed function of conformal cross ratios is trivial at six points .",
    "we thus conjectured the n - point correlator to vanish @xmath20 which was indeed proven in @xcite and also non - trivial evidence for a duality between wilson loops and correlators in abjm theory was found at one - loop level .",
    "furthermore , we computed the tetragonal wilson loop @xmath21 at two - loop order in pure chern - simons and abjm theory . remarkably , the result in dimensional reduction regularisation with @xmath22 for the correlator in abjm theory is of the same functional form as the one - loop result in @xmath4 super yang - mills theory .",
    "most interestingly , it was recently found by two independent approaches , using generalized unitarity methods in @xcite and by a direct superspace feynman diagram calculation in @xcite , that the two - loop result for four - point scattering amplitudes in abjm theory agrees with the wilson loop @xmath23 upon a specific identification of the regularisation scales @xcite .",
    "this establishes the first non - trivial example for a wilson loop / amplitude duality of the form in abjm theory .",
    "very recently , these result were extended to the more general case of abj theory in @xcite .    in light of these recent findings on structural similarities between observables in @xmath4 super yang - mills and abjm",
    "theory , it is natural to ask , whether the duality between wilson loops and amplitudes in abjm theory continues to hold beyond @xmath24 , as it does in @xmath4 .    in this work",
    "we perform numerical computations to extend our findings of @xcite to the @xmath1-sided wilson loop at two - loop order . remarkably , we find that the hexagonal wilson loop at two loops agrees with the corresponding wilson loop in @xmath4 super yang - mills .",
    "we perform a detailed numerical analysis for the hexagonal wilson loop leading to a guess for the @xmath1-point case , which we numerically check also for @xmath25 in a limited set of kinematical points .",
    "again we find , that the result agrees with the result for the wilson loop in @xmath4 super yang - mills .",
    "it is thus natural to expect the result to hold for all @xmath1 @xmath26 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is a constant that depends linearly on @xmath1 and is specified below and where the finite contribution @xmath29 is given by the finite part of the wilson loop in @xmath4 sym , which up to a constant . ]",
    "is the finite part in the bds conjecture @xcite , i.e. for @xmath24 and @xmath30 @xmath31\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the wilson loop in abjm theory at two - loop order precisely agrees with the form of the wilson loop or , via the amplitude / wilson loop duality , with the @xmath1-point mhv amplitudes at one loop in @xmath4 super yang - mills",
    ".    it would be very interesting to establish a six - point amplitude calculation in order to see whether the duality relation in abjm theory also holds at six points .",
    "furthermore , it would be interesting to perform a four - point amplitude or wilson loop computation at four loops , to check whether the conjectured bds - like ansatz @xcite for the four - point amplitude in abjm indeed holds .",
    "the relations between wilson loops , amplitudes and correlators seem to hold not only in the special case of the maximally supersymmetric @xmath4 sym theory but also in abjm theory .",
    "since the duality may thus not just be a particular feature of @xmath4 sym , it remains an important task to understand the precise origin of the similarity of these different observables in quantum field theory .",
    "the solution of the ward identity @xcite for the light - like polygonal wilson loop in pure chern - simons theory reads @xmath32\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a function that depends only on conformally invariant cross ratios @xmath35 which can be constructed starting from @xmath30 .",
    "+    at two loops there are two types of contributions to the wilson loop in pure chern - simons theory , one from two - gluon diagrams @xmath36 and another one from diagrams involving a three - gluon vertex @xmath37 @xmath38 the indices @xmath39 denote the edges that the propagators attach to , see figure [ fig:2typesofdiagrams ] and their expressions are given in appendix [ app : two - gluon ] , [ app : vertex ] .",
    "contributions from gauge- and ghost - loops cancel in dimensional reduction regularisation @xcite , for more details see @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the vertex diagrams are divergent in the region of integration where all three propagators approach the same edge ( all diagrams with more than one propagator on the same edge vanish identically due to the antisymmetry of the levi - civita symbol ) , and we split them up as in @xmath40 the divergent part can be calculated analytically @xmath41 thus , the function @xmath34 in is given by @xmath42 we evaluate these contributions using a mathematica program that generates all @xmath1-point diagrams , performs the index - contractions and numerically integrates the diagrams for randomly generated kinematical configurations , for more details see appendix [ app : two - gluon - diagrams ] .",
    "+   + * hexagonal wilson loop * +   + for the hexagonal wilson loop we evaluated the contributions in for a large set of conformally equivalent and conformally non - equivalent kinematical configurations .",
    "conformally equivalent configurations must yield the same result , since , by the anomalous conformal ward identity , the expectation value is constrained to the form , and thus the function @xmath34 depends only on conformally invariant quantities .",
    "it turns out , that even for kinematical configurations which are not conformally equivalent , the unknown function yields the same constant in , arises from the multiplication of the analytically known divergent term with an @xmath43 expansion of the prefactor , see . ]",
    "@xmath44 in figure [ fig : wvertextwogluonplot ] we show the results for the two - gluon and vertex contributions for a continuously deformed kinematical configuration , generated as explained in app .",
    "[ app : generation - kinematics ] , in order to illustrate , how the different contributions vary while their sum remains constant . +     + * generalization to @xmath1 cusps * +   + it turns out that also for @xmath25 the function of conformal cross ratios is just a constant , i.e. @xmath45 in figure [ fig : constant - dependence - on - number - of - cusps ] we show the dependence of the numerical constant @xmath46 on the number of cusps @xmath1 up to @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the constant depends linearly on the number of cusps @xmath1 .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that this dependence holds for all @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath48 which is the line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : constant - dependence - on - number - of - cusps ] with the parameters and @xmath30 , since here we have the smallest number of integrals and thus the best numerical result . at n - points",
    "we have to evaluate @xmath49 two - gluon and vertex integrals . ]",
    "@xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we expect the chern - simons contribution to the @xmath1-point wilson loop to be @xmath52\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the constant given by and .",
    "in abjm theory we have two gauge fields @xmath53 , @xmath54 and use the wilson loop operator proposed in @xcite , which is a linear combination of two wilson loops , each with one of the gauge fields , see also @xcite .",
    "the one - loop contributions are identical to pure chern simons theory and cancel each other .",
    "both two - loop contributions yield the same result and thus , it is sufficient to calculate the wilson loop with the gauge field @xmath53 .",
    "in addition to the chern - simons contributions we have contributions of bosonic and fermionic matter fields which appear in the one - loop corrected gluon - propagator @xmath55 the matter contribution is similar to the one in @xmath4 sym @xcite , since the one - loop corrected propagator calculated in @xmath56 dimensions @xcite is @xmath57 which up to two small differences is the tree level @xmath4 sym gluon propagator .",
    "the first difference is a trivial prefactor , and the second is that since we are at two loops , the power of @xmath58 is @xmath59 here , as opposed to @xmath60 in the one - loop computation in @xmath4 sym .",
    "thus , it is clear that the results will be very similar to the expectation value of the wilson loop in @xmath4 sym .    as in @xmath4 sym",
    "we have three classes of diagrams shown in figure [ fig : self - energy - diagrams ] .",
    "diagram [ fig : general - diagram - propagator - corrections - same - edge ] vanishes due to the light - likeness of the edges , whereas [ fig : general - diagram - propagator - corrections - adjacent ] yields a divergent , and [ fig : general - diagram - propagator - corrections - non - adjacent ] yields a finite contribution .",
