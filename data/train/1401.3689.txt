    "pseudoscalar sum rules have been introduced for the first time in @xcite for giving a bound on the sum of running light quark masses defined properly for the first time in the @xmath15-scheme by @xcite .",
    "its laplace transform version including power corrections introduced by svz @xcite , has been applied few months later to the pseudoscalar channel in @xcite and extended to the estimate of the su(3 ) corrections to kaon pcac in @xcite .",
    "its first application to the scalar channel was in @xcite .",
    "later on , the previous analysis has been reconsidered in @xcite for extracting e.g. the @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay constants .",
    "the first fesr analysis in the pseudoscalar channel has been done in @xcite which has been used later on by various authors",
    ".    however , the light pseudoscalar channel is _ quite delicate _ as the pt radiative corrections ( @xcite for the @xmath16 , @xcite for the @xmath17 , @xcite for the @xmath18 and @xcite for the @xmath5 corrections ) are quite large for low values of @xmath19 gev@xmath20 where the goldstone pion contribution is expected to dominate the spectral function , while ( less controlled ) and controversial instanton - like contributions @xcite might break the operator product expansion ( ope ) at a such low scale .",
    "however , working at higher values of @xmath21 for avoiding these qcd series convergence problems , one has to face the dominant contribution from radial excited states where a little experimental information is known .",
    "some models have been proposed in the literature for parametrizing the high - energy part of the spectral function .",
    "it has been proposed in @xcite to extract the @xmath22(1300 ) and k(1460 ) decay constants by combining the pesudoscalar and scalar sum rules which will be used in the laplace sum rules for extracting the light quark masses .",
    "though interesting , the analysis was quite qualitative ( no estimate of the errors ) such that it is not competitive for an accurate determination of the quark masses . this estimate has been improved in @xcite using a narrow width approximation ( nwa ) .",
    "later on , a much more involved chpt based parametrization of the pion spectral function has been proposed in @xcite where the model dependence mainly appears in the interference between the @xmath3 and the @xmath23 . using fesr with some weight functions inspired from @xmath1-decay @xcite ,",
    "the authors of @xcite have extracted the decay constants of the @xmath3 and the @xmath23 by assuming that they do not interfere in the spectral function .",
    "the results for the spectral function are one of the main ingredient for extracting the light quark masses from pseudoscalar sum rules and it is important to have a good control ( and a model - independence ) of its value for a more precise and model - independent determination of such light quark masses .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to extract the spectral function or the @xmath3 and k(1460 ) decay constants from the ratio of laplace sum rules known to order @xmath5 of perturbation theory ( pt ) and including power corrections up to dimension six within the svz expansion plus those beyond it such as the tachyonic gluon mass and the instanton contributions . with this result",
