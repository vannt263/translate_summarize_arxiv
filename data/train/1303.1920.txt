    "a significant achievement of the swift satellite is the simultaneous detection of the physical properties of the gamma ray bursts in the gamma , x - ray and optical domain , measured by the bat , xrt and uvot instruments on board of the satellite .",
    "following the alert given by bat the satellite starts to slew and after reaching the position of the burst the xrt and uvot make measurements in the x - ray and optical domain , respectively .",
    "although , a significant fraction of the bursts is detected by the xrt as well , it is not the case with the uvot where at a remarkable fraction of the events only an upper limit of the optical brightness is obtained .    from theoretical point of view the measured optical and gamma properties",
    "may be given by completely different phenomena , their observational relationship , if there is any , would be an important constraint for the possible models . to study this relationship",
    "it would be a serious bias if we take into account only those cases where all properties , i.e. gamma , x - ray and optical , are measured .",
    "survival analysis is a way to make use the information which is inherent in the value of the upper bound of the optical brightness .",
    "cox regression is a tool for studying the dependence of the survival function ( a result of the analysis ) on some background variables , the covariates ( gamma and x - ray properties in our case ) .    in the following we use cox regression to study the dependence of the distribution of the uvot detected optical brightness on measured gamma and x - ray properties .",
    "let we have a @xmath0 stochastic variable with @xmath1 probability density .",
    "the @xmath2 survival function is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 means the probability distribution function . actually , the @xmath2 survival function is its complement @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath2 can be estimated bias free even in the case when some of the values in the @xmath6 observed sample are only lower bounds ( censored ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath2 is called the hazard function : @xmath7\\ ] ] the @xmath8 hazard function characterizes the risk that in the @xmath9 $ ] range @xmath10 gives its probability ) an event will happen in the @xmath11 $ ] interval ( its unconditional probability is @xmath12 . the hazard function may depend on background variables ( the covariates ) .",
    "the cox model ( @xcite ) assumes that this dependency can be written in the form of @xmath13=\\alpha ( t)+b_1x_1+b_2x_2+\\ldots+b_mx_m\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the covariates while the @xmath15 arbitrary function and the @xmath16 constants have to be determined during the procedure of the cox regression .",
    "if all these constants are equal to zero the @xmath15 function is identical with the logarithmic hazard function .",
    "the value of the constants characterize the strengths of the influence of covariates on the hazard and , consequently on the survival function .",
    "we used for the present analysis the data available in the swift table recorded until the date of 03/03/2012 , in particular , the v magnitude as a dependent variable , duration , fluence , peak flux , photon index and early x - ray flux , as covariates in the analysis .",
    "except of the photon index we used logarithmic values in order to suppress the impact of the outliers on the regression .    since the optical brightness of the grb afterglow",
    "is seriously dimmed by the foreground galactic extinction we excluded the cases with the latitude of @xmath17 .        in the case",
    "if no afterglow was observed a lower bound in the stellar magnitude ( upper bound for the observed brightness ) was obtained .",
    "one can infer from fig .",
    "[ sinb ] that at low latitudes the depression is not present in the distribution of the cases where only a lower v magnitue bound was determined .",
    "before we make the cox regression running we have computed the bivariate correlations between the variables included in the analysis . in this procedure we have taken into account only those cases where both variable used for computing the correlation had measured values . to overcome the problem with the outliers we computed the spearman s rank correlation which is not sensitive to these .",
    ".spearmann s correlations ( numbers in bold face mark significant correlations ) [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     results of the cox regression are summarized in table  [ cox ] .",
    "seemingly , the duration , gamma fluence and peak flux has a significant impact on the distribution of the optical brightness , while the gamma photon index and the early x - ray flux do not .",
    "we performed cox regression in order to look for the impact of the gamma and x - ray properties of the grbs on the afterglows optical brightness .",
    "this approach is necessary since in a significant fraction of cases only an upper bound of the optical brightness ( lower bound in the v magnitude ) can be determined .",
    "the analysis demonstrated that among the @xmath18 coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ lhfunc ] ) belonging to the duration , fluence and peak flux differ significantly from zero . nevertheless , it is not the case with the gamma photon index and the early x - ray flux .",
    "the reason for the impact of some gamma properties on the optical brightness is probably lying in the energetics of the jet launched from the central engine of the grb which triggers the afterglow in the surrounding interstellar matter .",
