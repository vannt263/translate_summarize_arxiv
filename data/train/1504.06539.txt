    "a polynomial of degree @xmath0 with exactly one critical point is called unicritical . by conjugating the polynomial",
    ", we may move the critical point to @xmath8 and obtain a function of the form @xmath9 .",
    "the structure of the julia set depends on whether or not the critical point lies in the escaping set @xmath10 and this dichotomy gives rise to the multibrot set @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is in @xmath11 if and only if @xmath12 if and only if @xmath13 is connected , and otherwise @xmath13 is totally disconnected .",

    "if the smaller circle has radius @xmath16 and the larger circle has radius @xmath17 , then in rectangular coordinates , when the center of the larger circle is at the origin , then the epicycloid could be given by the parametric equations @xmath18 or in a more concise form @xmath19.\\ ] ] here , the smaller circle starts rolling on the left side of the bigger circle counterclockwise and @xmath20 represents the angle between the negative @xmath21-axis and the line segment between the origin and the center of the smaller circle ( not the argument of @xmath22 ) .",
