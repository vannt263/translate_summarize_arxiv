    "evaluation of the impact of this _ decoherence _ process is a key to understanding the feasibility of quantum computation@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate in detail the effect of decoherence on the quantum computer of chuang and yamamoto@xcite , which specifically implements the deutsch - josza solution to the one - bit oracle problem proposed by deutsch@xcite .",
    "the function of their machine is essentially to use an interference experiment to determine the class of a hidden function .",
    "there are only two possibilities , and in the absence of error the class is determined with certainty .",
    "the proposed realization uses an optical quantum computer with beam splitters and non - linear kerr medium ( figure  [ fig : machine ] ) .",
    "the function of each individual component is understood well from the study of quantum optics : the top and bottom pairs of single mode waveguides implement two qubits , the beamsplitter implements a @xmath0 logic gate , and the kerr medium implements a logic gate via cross - phase modulation between single photons .",
    "two important imperfections which lead to errors are energy loss and decoherence .",
    "the former occurs due to imperfect experimental implementation , such as facet reflections or absorption in waveguiding media .",
    "this loss of photons to the environment through scattering is a distributed process which is mathematically described as _",
    "amplitude damping_.    decoherence is different ; it is present even in cases in which energy loss is negligible .",
    "idle photons decohere very little at room temperature as they interact weakly with their environment .",
    "however , in the optical quantum computer we are analyzing the situation is different  the atom - photon interaction that occurs when the photons interact with each other through a kerr medium causes decoherence . in general",
    ", this interaction leaves correlations between atoms and photons thus leading to decoherence , since partial information about the photon s state is left behind in the atoms .",
    "this decoherence process is mathematically described as _ phase damping _ or phase randomization .",
    "the stochastic nature of decoherence likens it to a noise process and makes it a more insidious source of errors than loss ; its time - scale may be shorter than for energy loss@xcite , and as a practical matter it is harder to avoid .",
    "we will first calculate the general effect of loss and decoherence on an optical quantum fredkin gate , which is a typical elementary operation for a quantum computer .",
    "our models will then be used to analyze the effects on a complete system , the chuang - yamamoto quantum computer .",

    "the improvement in error probability given by use of this simple - minded qubit error correction scheme is shown in figure  [ fig : biterror ] .",
    "even more interesting is what happens when the loss is _ balanced _ such that all four modes suffer identically .",

    ", we find that the diagonal elements of the final density matrix are @xmath65      \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , since the only legal state which can be obtained from the above is @xmath66 ( there must be two photons in the output ) , we find that the after error correction , the error probability is _",
    "zero_. physically , this occurs because of the symmetry of the damping . in classical optics",
    ", it is well - known that by balancing the loss in an interferometer , unit visibility can be obtained . analogously , for a single - photon interferometer ( when only one photon is present in both arms ) , either the photon is lost ( in which case the output is @xmath59 ) , or coherence is preserved perfectly . this behavior is the basis for the regenerative properties of the dual - rail quantum bit@xcite .",
    "the above calculation indicates that errors due to loss can be prevented by using the appropriate design .",
    "however , the effect of phase damping is more insidious . to see this ,",
    "let us substitute our results for the noisy fredkin gate @xmath67 into @xmath68 and @xmath64 and calculate the output state @xmath55 , just as before .",

    "this means that our simple - minded error correction scheme ( i.e. simply rejecting illegal states ) fails !",
    "however , we have a more sophisticated method at our disposal .",
    "if we have _ a priori _ knowledge that under perfect operation , the state @xmath76 after the first fredkin gate will be either @xmath77/\\sqrt{2}$ ] or @xmath78/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , then we know that the space of legal results is spanned by @xmath79/\\sqrt{2}$ ] and @xmath80/\\sqrt{6}$ ] .",
    "we may thus detect errors by measuring the component of @xmath76 perpendicular to the @xmath81 space .",
    "the quantum circuit to do this is straightforward to design ; basically , we perform a unitary transform to get @xmath82 which is either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . when the last two labels are measured to be other than @xmath57 we know",
    "an error has occurred , and the trial is rejected .",
    "otherwise , we perform the inverse transform to restore the state , and continue as before . using this scheme",
    ", we find that the probability of error in the final result decreases from @xmath85 to @xmath86 for small @xmath37 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : laferr ] .",
    "the improvement achieved by the above indicates the possibility of using projective techniques to correct for phase randomization .",
    "ideally , it would be nice to be able to detect and correct for errors due to decoherence , just as is possible for amplitude damping using dual - rail qubits . along these lines",
    ", we have recently discovered a qubit representation which shows significant resistance to phase randomization@xcite ; instead of decohering at rate @xmath37 , we can achieve @xmath87 for arbitrary @xmath88 by introducing @xmath89 ancilla qubits ( which also decohere ! ) appropriately entangled .",
    "our analysis of the effects of loss and decoherence on a simple quantum computer indicates that although decoherence is a significant impediment to the realization of quantum computers , techniques exist which may be utilized to mitigate errors .",
    "in particular , the dual - rail quantum bit representation may be used to perfectly detect and correct errors due to amplitude damping .",
    "other representations also exist which may be used against phase randomization@xcite .",
    "alternatively , new technologies may be developed which allow single photon qubits to interact without decoherence ; the model used here is based on our understanding of bulk nonlinear optical materials , but other possibilities exist for resonant interactions which should have high @xmath90 , negligible loss , and short interaction lengths .",
    "these are based on single - photonics technologies@xcite that take advantage of our ability to engineer semiconductor devices .",
    "for example , we may envision a system consisting of the transmission of single photon dual - rail qubits over a fiber - optic link , with coding , decoding , and regeneration using exciton - polariton quantum logic gates and high - efficiency single - photon detectors .",
