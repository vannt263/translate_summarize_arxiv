    "pairing between fermions residing on separate fermi surfaces is one of the central questions in the fields of superconductors in a variety of solid state systems  @xcite , color superconductivity in quark matter  @xcite , and superfluidity in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . as was first intrigued by the study of magnetic field effect on superconductivity , the discussion on this interesting topic leads to proposals of various exotic pairing states , including the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo )  @xcite ,",
    "breached pair  @xcite , and deformed fermi surface phases  @xcite . among these candidates ,",
    "the fflo state consists of pairs formed by two fermions on top of each individual fermi surface , and is characterized by a finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "thanks for the high controllability and the separation of charge and spin degrees of freedom , ultracold atomic gases provide a versatile platform to study pairing physics with mismatched fermi surfaces .",
    "a large volume of investigations , both experimental and theoretical , suggest that although the fflo state may be restricted in a narrow parameter regime for a three - dimensional two - component fermi gas with mismatched fermi surfaces  @xcite , its existence is favored in low dimensions  @xcite and in systems with synthetic spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , where the fluctuations of the order parameter wave vector are restricted by the reduction of symmetry .",
    "in addition to fermi gases confined in harmonic traps , pairing with mismatched fermi surfaces are also analyzed theoretically for fermions loaded in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "one important finding is that due to the nesting effect between the two fermi surfaces , the fflo state can be remarkably favored as the nesting condition is satisfied .",
    "this effect is eminent in two - dimensions where a van hove singularity emerges when the nesting is perfect .",
    "besides , recent studies suggest that when the pairing takes place between fermions residing on different orbital bands , a special @xmath2-fflo phase with center - of - mass momentum @xmath5 can be stabilized in a large parameter regime for a quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) lattice potential with lattice spacing @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of such an exotic state is also a result of nesting effect induced by the relative inversion of the single - particle band structures of the two spin components .",
    "this @xmath2-fflo phase , or equivalently referred as @xmath2-phase , has been studied in heterostructures of ferromagnetic and superconducting layers  @xcite , high @xmath7 supercondcutors  @xcite , and spin - dependent quasi-1d optical lattices  @xcite , and has potential application for quantum computing in building up superconducting qubits via the @xmath2-junctions  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study inter - band pairing within two - component fermions loaded in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical lattice .",
    "we show that a @xmath2-fflo phase can be stabilized due to the nesting effect between the @xmath0- and @xmath8-orbital bands . by employing a mean - field approach ,",
    "we map out the zero temperature phase diagram by varying the chemical potential of each spin component , and find that the fflo states , either the @xmath2-phase or the conventional fflo state , is favored within a large parameter window . as a comparison , the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state with zero center - of - mass pairing momentum is not stable under the mean - field level calculation .",
    "we also study the evolution of phase diagrams by reducing the hopping integral along one direction , and recover the result for 1d configurations .",
    "we then take into account the phase fluctuation on top of the mean - field order parameter , and obtain the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition temperature @xmath4 for the @xmath2-fflo , conventional fflo , and the bcs phases .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we focus on an anisotropic configuration with @xmath17 much greater than @xmath18 and @xmath19 , such that the hopping integral along the @xmath20 direction is negligible to ensure quasi - two - dimensionality .",
    "besides , we also focus on the case with @xmath21 .",
    "this in - plane anisotropy breaks the @xmath22 rotational symmetry and lift the degeneracy between the @xmath1 and @xmath23 orbitals , so that we can concentrate on the energetically favorable @xmath1 orbital only .",
    "we may then refer the @xmath1 orbital simply as the @xmath8 orbital to simplify notation unless specified .     band ( dashed green ) are inert due to a large band gap .",
