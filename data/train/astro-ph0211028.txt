    "the composition of ns envelopes affects their cooling ( potekhin , chabrier & yakovlev 1997 ) and thermal radiation ( romani 1987 ) .",
    "the amount of material needed to change the spectral profile of the thermal radiation from the surface of a ns is miniscule ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "such a small amount of contamination could easily be produced from spallation ( bildsten , salpeter & wasserman 1992 ) of fallback material ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) soon after a supernova explosion .",
    "recent x - ray observations of the thermal spectrum from young radio pulsars have yielded tantalizing clues of their photospheric makeup ( see pavlov , zavlin & sanwal 2002 for a review ) . the thermal emission from young nss can be fit with two models : magnetic hydrogen atmospheres or blackbody atmospheres . both atmospheres fit the thermal spectra equally well , however they yield different effective temperatures and different solid angles for the emission area . the model which yields a more reasonable radius for the ns at the preferred distance",
    "is then taken as the favored model ( pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ) . for radio pulsars younger than @xmath2 ( e.g. vela ) ,",
    "the radius is reasonable for a magnetic hydrogen atmosphere model ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ) . for pulsars older than @xmath3 ( e.g. psr b0656 + 14 ) ,",
    "a blackbody model is favored ( see pavlov et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests a possible evolution of hydrogen to more blackbody like elements on a timescale of @xmath4 , and these indications have motivated our work .    at the photosphere ,",
    "the local temperature ( @xmath5 ) and density ( @xmath6 ) are too low to allow any significant nuclear evolution over @xmath4 . however at a depth 1 m underneath the photosphere , the temperature is roughly two orders of magnitude greater ( @xmath7 ) . consider a ns envelope of hydrogen on carbon ( we use c here as our fiducial proton capturing nucleus , results for other nuclei are in chang & bildsten 2003 ; cb03 hereafter ) as shown in figure 1 .          in diffusive equilibrium ,",
    "the separation between the hydrogen and carbon is not strict .",
    "rather a diffusive tail of hydrogen penetrates deep into the carbon layer .",
    "protons easily reach a depth where the temperature is sufficiently high for rapid capture onto c. since the hydrogen s diffusive tail is exponentially suppressed , there will be a region where proton captures are peaked , which we call the burning layer .",
    "the consumption of the hydrogen by burning will drive the diffusive tail out of equilibrium , which sets up a diffusive current of hydrogen that flows down from the hydrogen layer into the burning layer .",
    "we refer to this burning mechanism ( first mentioned by chui & salpeter 1964 and initially calculated by rosen 1968 ) as diffusive nuclear burning ( dnb ; cb03 ) . over time , given that there is no interstellar accretion or other processes to refresh the hydrogen layer , the h is depleted .",
    "this scenario presents several competing timescales .",
    "the first is the proton capture timescale in the burning layer , @xmath8 .",
    "the second is the time it takes protons to diffuse into the burning layer , @xmath9 . in the case where @xmath10 , the diffusive tail is always in equilibrium . in the opposite limit",
    ", the diffusive tail is modified by the burning . for simplicity we will only discuss the first case here .",
    "the equilibrium structure of the diffusive tail is calculated from hydrostatic balance for each ion , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the pressure , number density , atomic number and charge of the @xmath16th ion species and @xmath17 is the upward pointing electric field found by demanding charge neutrality , @xmath18 . the thermal structure is determined from the constant flux equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the opacity and @xmath21 is the effective temperature . given appropriate microphysics , the equilibrium thermal and compositional structure can be calculated ( see cb03 for additional details ) .",
    "the microphysics we have chosen in this paper are valid for the non - magnetic case , @xmath22 .",
    "the local hydrogen burning rate is @xmath26 , hence the total hydrogen burning rate per area on a ns , @xmath27 , is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the integrated column of hydrogen and @xmath30 is the characteristic burning time for that column . in figure 2 , we show the equilibrium structure for a fiducial ns model with @xmath31 and the total burning rate per log column , @xmath32 .",
    "the gaussian peak in the burning rate traces out the burning zone which is centered around a column of @xmath33 , which is about 20 cm below where most of the h resides .    , and total mass burning rate , @xmath34 for a ns radius of 10 km , as a function of @xmath35 for different fixed core temperatures and an underlying carbon layer .",
    "for each model , we list the logarithmic core temperature and associated logarithmic effective temperature.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    we relate the burning rate per column into a total mass burning rate @xmath36 . in figure 3 , we plot the characteristic burning time @xmath30 and associated @xmath34 as a function of the total hydrogen column , @xmath35 . for a given envelope with an initial column of hydrogen at a fixed core temperature , the evolution follows the curve up to the photosphere at @xmath37 . because the evolution follows a simple power law ,",
    "the lifetime for any given envelope is completely determined by the characteristic burning time , @xmath38 , at the photosphere .",
    "the curve for a central temperature of @xmath39 is cut off at large columns since the energy release from proton captures is comparable to the flux leaving the envelope .",
    "hence our assumption of constant flux is violated .",
    "what is also notable about figure 3 is that the curves follow a power law dependence which we derive in cb03 .",
    "future directions for dnb are including the microphysics for magnetic nss , calculating dnb without the constraint @xmath40 and allowing for an intervening helium layer .",
    "dnb allows for young neutron stars to have atmospheres other than hydrogen soon after birth .",
    "for instance , nss with carbon , nitrogen or oxygen photospheres can easily exist after burning off any initial h. dnb may help explain the recent observation of magnetic oxygen lines on 1e1207 + 56 ( see de luca s review in this volume , also see hailey & mori 2002 ) ."
