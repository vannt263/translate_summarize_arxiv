    "optical systems which display quantum entanglement properties in the spatial domain are of great interest for applications , since the amount of information that can be manipulated and processed in parallel exploiting quantum correlation effects increases substancially with respect to the case of single mode beams .",
    "recently , there has been a rise of interest in the utilisation of entangled beam in optical imaging ( quantum imaging ) @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the field generated through the process of frequency down - conversion in a travelling wave optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that such a system , when coupled with an appropriate classical imaging device , is able to generate two symmetrical amplified copies of an injected input image that are strongly correlated one to each other : they indeed display synchronized local intensity fluctuations at the level of quantum noise , and for this reason they may be referred to as twin images .    here we present new results , that consolidate and complete the picture , showing that the two output images are locally correlated , not only with respect to intensity fluctuations , but also to `` phase '' fluctuations . to carry out a phase - sensitive measurements",
    ", we consider a homodyne detection scheme that allows us to compare the fluctuations of field quadrature components from two corresponding pixels of the two output images .",
    "we find in general that , for an arbitrary quadrature component characterized by the phase @xmath0 of the local oscillator , the difference between the fluctuations measured in two symmetrical pixels displays exactly the same spectrum as the sum of the fluctuations in the orthogonal quadrature component @xmath1 .",
    "the common value can be reduced well below the shot noise level over the whole image area , provided that the amplification is large enough and the phase @xmath0 is correctly adjusted .",
    "the choice of the phase is crucial to obtain a large level of quantum correlations between symmetrical pixels for the quadrature component @xmath0 and anticorrelation for the quadrature component @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the twin images exhibit a complete einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) @xcite entanglement with respect to continous variables @xcite .",
    "since quantum correlations are shown to exist for any couple of symmetrical pixels over the whole area of the output images , we speak of spatial quantum entanglement .",
    "the system exhibits a _",
    "realization of the epr paradox for two orthogonal quadrature components of the output field similar to that shown in @xcite for the case of the parametric oscillator below threshold . in comparison with the analysis of @xcite",
    ", we consider here also the case in which a coherent image is injected into the system .",
    "furthermore , the consideration of an opa , instead of an optical parametric oscillator with spherical mirrors , allows for obtaining here completely analytical results .    in presence of an input image ,",
    "the mean output field is different from zero , and therefore amplitude ( i.e. intensity ) and phase fluctuations correspond to special cases of quadrature fluctuations .",
    "therefore the previous analysis allows for concluding in a rather straightforward way that in symmetrical pixels not only quantum intensity fluctuations are strongly correlated , but phase fluctuations are anticorrelated in the same amount .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . after a presentation of the optical image amplification scheme in section",
    "ii , in the third section we study the fluctuation spectrum of the quadrature components measured in homodyne detection .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the discussion of amplitude and phase fluctuations .",
    "the final section includes conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the experimental procedure to generate a pair of quantum entangled images through the process of parametric down - conversion close to the degenerate frequency has been discussed in previous papers @xcite and can be summarized as follows .",
    "the @xmath2 crystal is enclosed between two lenses @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as shown in fig.i .",
    "we take the @xmath5 axis as the main light propagation direction and indicate with @xmath6 the point coordinates in a generic transverse plane .",
    "not shown in the figure is the coherent pump field that activates the process of down - conversion and which we take as an ideal classical monochromatic plane wave of frequency @xmath7 , propagating inside the crystal along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "+ the crystal slab of width @xmath8 , ideally infinite in the transverse directions , is cut for type i quasi - collinear phase - matching at the degenerate frequency @xmath9 . under these assumptions",
    ", each elementary down - conversion process corresponds to the splitting of a pump photon of frequency @xmath7 into a pair of photons of frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) , propagating with the same polarization and with opposite transverse wavevectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we designate by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the slowly varying envelope operators of the down - converted field ( with respect to the carrier frequency @xmath9 ) in the input plane @xmath19 , the entrance plane @xmath20 of the @xmath2 crystal slab , its exit plane @xmath21 , and the output plane @xmath22 , respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we denote by @xmath23 , @xmath24 their fourier transforms in time and in space - time respectivelly .",
    "the purpose of the two lenses is to map the fourier plane @xmath25 into the physical plane @xmath26 . in this manner ,",
    "if an optical image is injected at the degenerate frequency @xmath9 in the object plane @xmath19 , the system amplifies portions of this image rather than a band of its @xmath27-vectors .",
    "indeed , the input - output transformation which describes propagation inside the crystal in the linear regime , assuming that pump depletion and losses are negligible , can be written as @xcite : @xmath28 the presence of the lenses converts it into a relation between the real - space field operators in the plane @xmath19 and @xmath22 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 is the focal length of the two lenses and @xmath32 is the wavelength of the down - converted field .",
    "the explicit expressions of the gain coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we just notice that they depend on the linear gain parameter @xmath35 and on the dispersion properties of the crystal ; they are functions of the modulus of @xmath13 and @xmath36 and , for @xmath37 , display a broad maximum , corresponding to that transverse wavenumber which is phase - matched at the degeneracy frequency , for which ( within the paraxial approximation ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the wave numbers of the signal and the pump field at the carrier frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath7 , respectivelly , and @xmath41 is the collinear phase mismatch parameter which is assumed non negative .",
    "the width of the _ plateau _ around the value ( [ q2 ] ) is on the order of @xmath42 , the variation scale of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the spatial frequency domain .      for the scheme of fig.1",
    ", the region in the transverse plane which can be efficiently amplified without distortion has a linear size on the order of @xmath48 which represents the width of the _ plateau _ of the real - space gain functions ( [ uvbarrati ] ) .",
    "such a region has either the shape of a disc of area @xmath49 centered at the origin , or a ring of width @xmath50 , depending on the possibility to have collinear ( @xmath51 ) or non - collinear ( @xmath52 ) phase - matching at @xmath37 , respectivelly .",
    "we assume that the input image is a coherent stationary field of frequency @xmath9 confined in this region of plane @xmath19 ( see fig.1 ) so that @xmath53 as explained in details in @xcite , whenever the input image is symmetric with respect to the system axis , the device works as a phase - sensitive amplifier ( see in this connection also @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the phase of the input image must be selected in order to optimize the gain . assuming the input image is duplicated before amplification by means of a classical imaging device which allows to obtain a symmetrical field ditribution ( i.e. @xmath54 ) , the system is able to generate in the output plane two amplified copies that are far better correlated in space - time than the originals , meaning by this that they display perfectly ( in the ideal case ) synchronized local intensity fluctuations .",
    "it was also demonstrated @xcite that in the limit of high gain , the signal - to - noise ratio as measured from a small portion of the input image before duplication is preserved in the corresponding portions of the two output images : _ noiseless _ amplification is therefore achieved for both output channels taken separately ( see @xcite for an experimental observation of noiseless amplification of images ) .    in @xcite an alternative way to generate a pair of quantum correlated images ( also called _ twin images _ ) was considered ; it consists in injecting a single input image asymetrically , for example by confining it to the upper half of plane @xmath19 as shown in fig.1 . this configuration does not require a duplication system and presents the further advantage that the gain does not depend on the phase of the input field because the systems works as a phase - insensitive amplifier",
    "however , the fidelity with which information is transferred is worse than in the phase - sensitive case , since the signal - to - noise ratio is deteriorated at least by a factor two in the amplification process ( a feature common to all phase - insensitive optical amplifiers @xcite ) .",
    "most of the results presented in this paper do not depend on the particular injection scheme , so no assumption are made on the input intensity distribution @xmath55 .",
    "imperfect detection can be modelled in the usual way , by coupling the output field operator @xmath18 with an independent operator field @xmath56 which acts on the vacuum state .",
    "the contribution @xmath57 describes the noise added by losses in the detection process ; thus the effective output field measured by a detector of quantum efficiency @xmath58 is @xmath59 and the corresponding photon flux density is @xmath60 as shown in fig.1 , at the exit face of the crystal we insert a pupil of area @xmath61 , an element that allows for eliminating divergencies which arise in the calculation of the field mean intensity and correlation functions when dealing with a system of infinite transverse dimensions @xcite .",
    "it also determines the characteristic resolution area of the device in the detection plane , which is @xmath62 .",
    "this finite size optical element introduces a convolution integral with the pupil response function in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ inputoutput2 ] ) and , as a consequence , the points of the input image are spread into diffraction spots of area @xmath63 in the output image .",
    "however , analytical calculations are performed in the _ low diffraction limit _ , assuming that the diffraction spot size @xmath64 is much smaller than both @xmath65 and the variation scale of the input image intensity . considering a single pixel detector ( labelled by index @xmath66 ) that intercepts the photons arriving on an area @xmath67 which is large in comparison with @xmath63 ,",
    "the mean value of the measured photocurrent is then @xcite : @xmath68 gives an evaluation of the number of details of the input image which can be resolved in the detection plane ( e.g. with the pixel array of a ccd camera ) .",
    "moreover , quantum correlation effects tends to disappear when @xmath69 , since in this limit the signal and idler photons of each down - converted pair can no more be resolved separately , because of the large diffraction spread in @xmath27-space . making @xmath63 as small as possible with respect to @xmath70 is therefore a necessary requirement that must be taken into account in experiments .",
    "however , this leads to an increase of the spontaneous emission contribution which goes at the expense of the visibility of the amplified input image .",
    "this last circumstance imposes a lower limit on the intensity of the input image ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "a homodyne detection scheme allows for the measurement of a particular quadrature component of the field .",
    "it consists in a beam splitter that combines the output field with a coherent field of much higher intensity , @xmath71 , which can be treated as a classical quantity and is usually referred to as the local oscillator field ( lo ) . in the balanced version a 50/50 beam splitter is used , so that the operators associated to the fields coming from the two output ports of the beam - splitter , labelled by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are @xmath74/\\sqrt{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the effective fields seen by two identical detectors of quantum efficiency @xmath75 in the two ports @xmath72 and @xmath73 are @xmath76 where @xmath77 describe the noise added in the detection process . when the corresponding intensities are electronically substracted , one obtains a direct measure of the quadrature component of the output field @xmath78 selected by the phase of the lo , more precisely @xmath79\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "taking into account the finite size of the pixel detection area @xmath67 , the measured quantity is @xmath82 we now want to compare the fluctuations of the field quadrature measured in two symmetrical pixels @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the signal and idler image . to this aim",
    ", we consider the sum and the difference of the quadrature obtained from two symmetrical detection regions @xmath85 and @xmath86 : @xmath87 the corresponding fluctuation spectra , defined as @xmath88 describe the degree of correlation between the observables @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "using the input - output transformation ( [ inputoutput2 ] ) , the commutation rules ( [ commut ] ) and the fact that the input image is coherent we obtain the following relations :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the shot noise level determined by the lo on the two detectors ( we assumed @xmath93 ) .",
    "next , we assume that the lo is symmetric with respect to the system axis , i.e. @xmath94 . because @xmath95 we can write : @xmath96 where @xmath97 note that the above expression corresponds to the fluctuation spectrum normalized to shot noise when @xmath98 and the pixel area is small with respect to @xmath99 and to the square of the scale of variation of @xmath100 . in this case @xmath101 in eq.([vpm2 ] ) must be taken as the central point of pixel 1 or pixel 2 ; the result is the same for both pixels because @xmath102,@xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "a first important result follows from the first equality ( [ vpm ] ) ) , according to which @xmath89 and @xmath90 are correlated one to each other exactly to the same extent as the corresponding orthogonal quadrature components @xmath105 and @xmath106 are anti - correlated .",
    "second , the common fluctuation spectrum of the two observables @xmath107 and @xmath108 as given by expression ( [ vpm ] ) does not depend on the intensity and phase of the input image .",
    "hence the result is the same in the phase - insensitive and in the phase - sensitive scheme , and remains the same even in absence of an input image at all , i.e. in the case of pure parametric fluorescence .",
    "third , this spectrum can be reduced well below the shot noise level , provided the gain is large enough and the phase of the lo is correctly adjusted . indeed , assuming that @xmath109 over the two detection areas , using the symmetry property of the lo @xmath110 and unitarity relations ( [ unitarity ] ) , one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ vpm ] ) for @xmath37 : @xmath111 ^ 2 }    \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which goes to zero when @xmath112 . under conditions of large gain and reasonably large quantum efficiency , almost perfect correlation between the selected quadratures can therefore be obtained .",
    "it is interesting to relate the phase of optimum squeezing ( in @xmath107 ) @xmath113 for the lo with the phase of maximum amplification in the phase sensitive configuration .",
    "the mean output field is in general @xmath114 where we used eq.([inputoutput2 ] ) and eq.([a1 ] ) . in the phase sensitive case",
    "@xmath115 we can write @xmath116 with the phase - sensitive gain given by : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the phase of @xmath119 .",
    "we easily obtain that the maximum gain @xmath120 is obtained for : @xmath121 on the other hand , from eq.([aout ] ) with @xmath54 one obtains that when @xmath122 the phase @xmath123 of the output field @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 and therefore coincides with @xmath126 given by eq.([maxcorr ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following interpretation for @xmath113 : the phase @xmath0 of optimum squeezing in @xmath127 coincides with the phase of the output field in the phase - sensitive configuration , provided the phase of the input field is selected to have maximal amplification .",
    "note that in the special case of perfect phase matching one has @xmath128 so that @xmath129 given by eq.([phiin ] ) coincides with the corresponding @xmath130 .",
    "the results obtained for the observables @xmath131 closely ressemble the situation of the epr paradox for continous variables demonstrated in @xcite , but generalised to many pixels ( see also @xcite ) and to the presence of input images .",
    "we notice indeed that the conjugated observables @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) obey the uncertainty rule : @xmath135 ^ 2\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the following combination over the two pixels : @xmath136 and @xmath137 are commuting observables that can be simultanously determined .",
    "when the time of measurement @xmath138 is much larger than the inverse of the temporal bandwidth of the opa , using eq.([defv ] ) , the uncertainty of these observables can be directly related to the fluctuations spectrum @xmath139 @xmath140    for @xmath98 , an optimal adjustement of the lo phase allows these uncertainties to reach almost a zero value for large amplification and thus to display an apparent violation of the heisenberg rule : @xmath141 ^ 2 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , it is impractical to synthetyze a lo with the phase variation prescribed by eq.([maxcorr ] ) . on the other hand , for a lo with constant phase , the condition ( [ maxcorr ] ) concerning the phase of the lo can be exactly satisfied only for a single couple of pixels of area small compared to @xmath70 , so that the gain functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 are nearly uniform over the detection areas . we can however show that , by introducing an appropriate curvature the the wavefront of the lo field , epr - like correlations are present for each couple of symmetric pixels in the output over the whole gain region @xmath70 . to this end",
    ", we allow the lo phase distribution to have a quadratic dependence on the spatial coordinate ( which corresponds to a spherical wavefront as one has e.g. in gaussian beams ) .",
    "the wavefront curvature is selected in order to have the best fit of the spatial dependance of @xmath126 in eq.([maxcorr ] ) .",
    "figure 2 plots the function @xmath144 in the limit where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are small compared to @xmath70 and symmetric .",
    "the collinear phase - mismatch at degeneracy is @xmath145 and the linear gain parameter is @xmath146 .",
    "curve ( a ) corresponds to the ideal case , with @xmath0 satisfying condition ( [ maxcorr ] ) everywhere in the transverse plane , and leads to a maximal amount of noise reduction in the whole amplification region . in curve ( b ) , the phase of the lo is constant and satisfies condition ( [ maxcorr ] ) only in the point of maximum gain @xmath147 , where perfect phase - matching is achieved , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "curve ( c ) , obtained by optimizing the phase with a quadratic term ( i.e. we take the form @xmath150 ) , is the best that can be done with a gaussian lo and is close to the ideal case .",
    "although the phase - sensitive measurement scheme considered in the last section offers a picture of the spatial correlations that can be observed in the output field , intensity correlation measurements are more straightforward to perform experimentally and lead also to interesting effects of quantum noise reduction @xcite .",
    "the observable that displays reduced fluctuations with respect to the coherent state level is the difference between the direct photocurrents measured from two symmetrical detection region @xmath151 .",
    "the corresponding fluctuation spectrum is @xmath152 by using ( [ inputoutput2 ] ) , ( [ commut ] ) , ( [ ad ] ) , ( [ i ] ) , ( [ intensity ] ) and the fact that input image is in a coherent state one obtains after lengthy but elementary calculations @xmath153                          \\label{ispectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 is given by eq.([aout ] ) .",
    "the shot noise level corresponds to the photocurrent sum @xmath155 . the second term on the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ ispectrum ] ) arises from the interference between the amplified input field and the fluorescence field .",
    "the last term , which does not depend on the presence of an input field , is a pure noise contribution due to the self - interference of the fluorescence field and reduces to zero for @xmath37 because @xmath156 @xcite .    using the explicit expression of the amplified input field ( [ aout ] ) and the fact that @xmath157 , @xmath158 and eq.([unitarity ] )",
    ", we find for the zero frequency value of the spectrum @xmath159 as shown in @xcite in the case of ideal detection ( @xmath98 ) , the noise level of @xmath160 reduces therefore to the noise of the input image over @xmath161 . as a consequence , under conditions of large gain ,",
    "fluctuations are well below the shot noise level .",
    "it is important now to connect with the result for quadrature components obtained in the previous section . to this aim ,",
    "let us first assume that the input field is strictly different from zero at least in some region of the transverse plane .",
    "second , let us assume that the parametric values are such that the pure noise contribution in @xmath162 ( i.e. the last term in eq.([ispectrum ] ) ) is negligible and , similarly , that the second term in eq.([intensity ] ) can be dropped . thus expression ( [ ispectrum ] ) ) reduces to @xmath163 where @xmath164 and we used eq.([aout ] ) . by comparing with eqs.([vpm ] ) and",
    "( [ snlo ] ) , we see that this expression coincides with @xmath165 if we take : @xmath166 this is expected because a lo with the configuration of the output field just picks up the amplitude fluctuations .",
    "the relation becomes even more precise in the phase - sensitive case @xmath167 . in this case , assuming @xmath98 and that the pixel area is small with respect to @xmath99 and to the square of the scale of variation of @xmath154 , one has : @xmath168 where we set @xmath169 , and @xmath101 is the central point of any of the two symmetrical pixels .",
    "the result coincides with that of eq.([vpm2 ] ) where @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath123 .",
    "the link between intensity fluctuations and quadrature fluctuations allows now to analyse immediately the case of phase fluctuations , which coincide with the quadrature fluctuations obtained by using a lo which displays a phase shift of @xmath170 with respect to lo which provides the amplitude fluctuations .",
    "therefore , in terms of pixels , we are lead consider the observables @xmath171 ( see eq.([zx ] ) ) with @xmath172 .",
    "this naturally induces us to focus on the observable @xmath173 , see eq.([zxpm ] ) , which measures the degree of anticorrelation between the phase fluctuations in the two symmetrical pixels 1 and 2 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath174 coincides with @xmath165 , which as we have seen is identical to @xmath175 given by eq.([ispectrum3 ] ) .",
    "therefore for large amplification the fluctuations of @xmath176 are well below the shot noise level , which implies that the phase fluctuations in the two symmetrical pixels are strongly anticorrelated , exactly as the amplitude fluctuations are strongly correlated .",
    "in this article we analyzed extensively a system formed by an optical parametric amplifier with some imaging lenses .",
    "amplification of optical images by opa has been already studied in the literature @xcite , but only from a classical viewpoint .",
    "our results hold both for a phase - sensitive configuration ( symmetrical input image ) and for a phase insensitive one ( asymmetrical injection ) .",
    "we demonstrated that the two output twin images exhibit a complete spatial epr entanglement .",
    "this was shown , first of all , by considering a pair of orthogonal quadrature components of the output field . in the case of local oscillator symmetrical with respect to the system axis",
    ", we found a precise prescription for the phase @xmath0 of the local oscillator ( see introduction ) in order to observe maximal correlation between symmetrical pixels of the two output images .",
    "the optimal value for the phase is that which corresponds to the amplitude fluctuations of the output images in the phase sensitive configuration , when the phase of the symmetrical input images is selected to obtain maximal amplification .    we have shown also that a performance very close to that of the ideal case of the optimal lo phase can be obtained in practice by using a lo with a quadrature wavefront ( as one has in gaussian beams ) with the curvature used as optimisation parameter .",
    "the connection between quadrature fluctuations and amplitude / phase fluctuations has in turn allowed us to conclude also that , while intensity fluctuations are strongly correlated in the twin images , phase fluctuations are strongly anticorrelated in the same amount .",
    "an amusing analogy with amplitude and phase fluctuations in entangled twin images is provided by a fossile broken in two pieces ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "we see that the structures in the two pieces have the same `` amplitude '' = thickness , but opposite `` phase '' ( one is concave and the other convex , one is righthanded and the other lefthanded ) .",
    "it is important to underline that , while the results for intensity and phase fluctuations hold only in presence of an input image , the result on epr entanglement of quadrature components hold also in absence of any input image , i.e. in the case of the pure parametric down - conversion as in @xcite .",
    "this is important for the applications to quantum teleportation of optical images @xcite , as a generalisation of the braunstein - kimble @xcite scheme for a single mode field , or to quantum cryptography with images .",
    "we observe finally that our results hold also if the opa is replaced by an optical parametric oscillator below threshold with plane mirrors ( see @xcite in this connection ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "also in this case one has an input - output relation of the form ( [ inputoutput2 ] ) , and the results are based only on this relation and on the general properties of the functions @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
