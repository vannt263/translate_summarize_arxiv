    "if @xmath4 and if @xmath5 then the fixed - point set of @xmath6 consists of isolated fixed points and their number can be calculated , as described below , by a formula which is completely analogous to macbeath s formula @xcite concerning automorphisms of riemann surfaces . however , if @xmath7 then the fixed - point set of the involution @xmath8 consists of a finite number @xmath9 of disjoint simple closed curves called _ ovals _ together with a finite number of isolated fixed points @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the ovals may be _ twisted _ or _ untwisted _ which means that they have mbius band or annular neigbourhoods respectively .    in this note",
    "we calculate the number of ovals and isolated fixed - points of @xmath8 and whether the ovals are twisted or not .",
    "the information is given , as in macbeath @xcite in terms of the universal covering transformation group .",

    "if @xmath0 is a compact non - orientable klein surface of genus @xmath1 then the orientable two - sheeted covering surface of @xmath0 has genus @xmath10 , so that the universal covering space of @xmath0 is the upper half - plane h ( with the hyperbolic metric ) and the group of covering transformations is a non - orientable surface subgroup @xmath11 generated by glide - reflections . if @xmath12 is a group of automorphisms of @xmath0 then the elements of @xmath12 lift to a _ non - euclidean crystallographic ( nec ) group _ @xmath13 acting on h. there is a smooth epimorphism @xmath14 whose kernel is @xmath11 , where smooth means that @xmath15 preserves the orders of elements of finite order in @xmath13 .",
    "the transformation group @xmath16 is called the _ universal covering transformation group _ of @xmath17 .",
    "now let @xmath18 be a cyclic group of order @xmath19 .",
    "as @xmath15 is smooth we must have @xmath20 for every reflection @xmath21 in @xmath13 .",
    "also we can not have two distinct reflections in @xmath13 whose product has finite order .",
    "so it follows , in the canonical presentation of nec groups as given in @xcite or @xcite , that @xmath13 has empty period cycles .",
    "thus @xmath13 has signature of the form @xmath22 ; \\ { ( \\quad)^k \\})\\ ] ] with @xmath23 empty period cycles ; then @xmath13 has one of the two presentations depending on whether there is a @xmath24 or a @xmath25 in the signature ;    for the @xmath26 case @xmath27    for the @xmath28 case @xmath29    in these presentations the generators @xmath30 are elliptic elements , the generators @xmath31 are reflections , _ the generating reflections _ of @xmath13 , and the generators @xmath32 are orientation - preserving transformations called the",
    "_ connecting generators_. each empty period cycle corresponds to a conjugacy class of reflections in @xmath13 .",
    "one important fact to note about these presentations is that the connecting generator @xmath32 commutes with the generating reflection @xmath31 , and in fact the centralizer of @xmath31 in @xmath13 is just the group @xmath33 .",
    "( see @xcite )",
    "let @xmath0 be a non - orientable surface of topological genus @xmath35 and let @xmath34 be an automorphism of order @xmath19 . if @xmath36 and @xmath37 then the number of fixed points of the automorphism @xmath6 is given by macbeath s formula ( see @xcite ) . if @xmath6 has order @xmath38 than @xmath6 has @xmath39 fixed points , where @xmath40 runs over the periods in @xmath41 .",
    "this is because macbeath s proof ( applying to fuchsian groups ) only uses the facts that each period corresponds to a unique conjugacy class of elliptic elements of @xmath13 , and each elliptic element has a unique fixed point in h. now , the number of isolated fixed points of @xmath6 is independent of the smooth epimorphism @xmath15 above .",
    "however the epimorphism @xmath15 does play a part in the number of ovals of @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a non - orientable surface of topological genus @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a group of automorphisms of @xmath0 , and let @xmath15 and @xmath13 be as described in equations [ epi ] and [ sign ] .",
    "if @xmath44 than the number of ovals of the involution @xmath42 is @xmath45 and the number of isolated fixed points of @xmath42 is @xmath46    let @xmath47 so that @xmath48 contains the group @xmath49 with index @xmath50 .",
    "now , @xmath48 must have signature of the form @xmath51 ; \\ { ( \\quad)^s \\})\\ ] ] with @xmath52 periods equal to @xmath50 and @xmath53 empty period cycles .",
    "the reason that all periods in @xmath48 are equal to @xmath50 is because if @xmath40 in @xmath54 is even then @xmath55 and any elliptic element of @xmath48 are conjugate to some @xmath56 ( see @xcite ) .    by results in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , r is the number of isolated fixed points of @xmath42 and is given by macbeath s formula @xmath57    it also follows from @xcite that the number of ovals of @xmath42 is just the number @xmath53 of period cycles in @xmath48 , which corresponds to the number of conjugacy classes of reflections in @xmath48 .",
    "as a reflection @xmath31 in @xmath48 belongs also to @xmath13 and the group @xmath13 has @xmath23 conjugacy classes of reflections , we just have to determine into how many @xmath48conjugacy classes the @xmath13conjugacy class of @xmath31 splits .",
    "we shall use the epimorphism @xmath15 to calculate this number .",
    "there is a transitive action of @xmath13 on the @xmath48conjugacy classes of @xmath31 in @xmath48 by letting @xmath58 map the reflection @xmath59 to @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "( because @xmath62 ) . clearly , if @xmath63 then @xmath64 has a trivial action on these @xmath48conjugacy classes .",
    "so we have an action of @xmath65 on these classes .",
    "as the centralizer of @xmath31 in @xmath13 is just @xmath66 , the stabilizer of the @xmath48conjugacy classes of @xmath31 in @xmath48 are the cosets @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , the least positive power of @xmath32 that belongs to @xmath48 .",
    "now , let @xmath69 .",
    "then either @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "the additive group @xmath72 contains a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath73 and @xmath74 has order @xmath75 in @xmath73 so that @xmath76 has the same order in @xmath72 if and only if @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath78 then the order of @xmath76 in @xmath72 is twice the order of @xmath76 in @xmath73 and we then find that @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 .    by the above argument on the action of @xmath82 on the @xmath48conjugacy classes of @xmath31 we see that the number of such classes is @xmath83 , which is    if @xmath84 @xmath85    or if @xmath71 @xmath86 thus in both cases the generating reflection @xmath31 of @xmath13 induces @xmath87 conjugacy classes of reflections in @xmath48 .",
    "thus the number of ovals of @xmath8 in @xmath0 is @xmath88    the ovals of @xmath8 in @xmath0 induced by the @xmath89th period cycle in @xmath13 are twisted if @xmath90 and untwisted if @xmath91 .",
    "as we have found in theorem 3.1 , the @xmath89th empty period cycle in @xmath13 induces @xmath92j@xmath93 empty period cycles in @xmath48 .",
    "the generating reflections of these period cycles are just conjugates of @xmath31 in @xmath13 and , as the corresponding connecting generator @xmath32 is just the orientation - preserving element generating the centralizer of @xmath31 in @xmath13 , we see that the connecting generator of each of the period cycles in @xmath48 induced by the @xmath89th period cycle in @xmath13 is just conjugate to @xmath94 , @xmath68 as in the proof of theorem 3.1 .",
    "now , let @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , be the restriction of the epimorphism @xmath97 . then    if @xmath84 @xmath98    if @xmath71 @xmath99 @xmath100 the generator of @xmath101 .",
    "generally , if @xmath21 is the generating reflection of an empty period cycle of @xmath48 and @xmath102 is the corresponding connecting generator then figures 1 and 2 show that @xmath103 corresponds to an untwisted oval while @xmath104 corresponds to a twisted oval .",
    "however , as in the proof of theorem 3.1 @xmath84 if and only if @xmath91 and hence we have untwisted ovals while @xmath71 if and only if @xmath90 and we have twisted ovals .",
    "in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) scherrer showed that that if an involution of a non - orientable surface of genus @xmath105 has @xmath106 fixed points and @xmath107 ovals then @xmath108 in our examples we will show that for any integer @xmath109 we can find a non - orientable surface of genus @xmath105 admitting a @xmath110 action with generator @xmath34 such that @xmath42 attains the scherrer bound .",
    "* example 1*bujalance @xcite found the maximum order for an automorphism @xmath34 of a non - orientable surface @xmath0 of genus @xmath1 ; it is @xmath111 for odd @xmath105 and @xmath112 for even @xmath105 .",
    "the universal covering transformation group @xmath13 has signature @xmath113 ; \\ { ( \\quad)\\})$ ] for odd @xmath105 , and signature @xmath114 ; \\ { ( \\quad)\\})$ ] for even @xmath105",
    ". there is , essentially , only one way of defining the epimorphism @xmath15 in each case :        using macbeath s formula ( [ iso ] ) we see that the involution @xmath124 has @xmath105 fixed points for surfaces of both odd and even genera .",
    "now , if @xmath105 is odd then the involution @xmath124 also has , by theorems 3.1 and 3.2 , one twisted oval if @xmath105 is odd as @xmath125 . if @xmath105 is even then the involution @xmath126 has , by theorems 3.1 and 3.2 , one untwisted oval as @xmath127 and @xmath128",
    "we note that the involution @xmath124 obeys the scherrer bound .",
    "note that the orders of the cyclic groups in bujulance s examples are @xmath129 mod 4 .",
    "our second example shows that the scherrer bound can be obtained for the involution in a @xmath130 action .",
    "* example 2*let @xmath0 be a non - orientable surface of genus @xmath131 , and let @xmath34 be an automorphism of @xmath0 of order @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath13 have signature @xmath133 ; ( \\quad)^k)\\ ] ] and define a smooth epimorphism @xmath134 by mapping the generators of order two to @xmath135 , the two generators of order 4 to @xmath34 and @xmath136 and the connecting generators to the identity .",
    "we then find that for the involution @xmath135 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138,and @xmath139 , so that we find infinitely many surfaces where the scherrer bound is attained for the involution in @xmath130 .",
