    "in 1958 , sparnaay discovered that two uncharged conductor plates , situated in a near perfect vacuum and at a temperature near absolute zero , attract each other with a force whose intensity per surface unit is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance @xmath0 which exist between them .",
    "for @xmath1 cm , sparnaay was able to measure a force of @xmath2 g@xmath3cm@xmath3s@xmath5 , and deduced the formula : @xmath6 , in which @xmath7 , sparnaay s constant , is equal to @xmath8 erg@xmath3 cm .    in [ 1 ] , we proposed the hypothesis that the force measured by sparnaay is caused by the fact that the presence of the two uncharged conductor plates prevents the photons of zero - point radiation which fall at an angle greater than @xmath9 and have a wavelength greater than @xmath10 , from being reflected from the space between the two plates , since they will have been already reflected from outside that space .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "1 that the ` do not fit'into the space between the plates .    in a perfect vacuum and at the absolute temperature",
    "@xmath11 k@xmath12 , the phenomenon observed by sparnaay can only be due to a radiation inherent to space , the existence of which had been suggested by nernst in 1916 .",
    "such a radiation would have to possess a relativistically invariant spectrum , which implies that the relative abundance of its photons must be inversely proportional to the cubes of their wavelengths .",
    "in other words , the number of photons of wavelength @xmath13 which fall on a given area , within a given lapse of time , must be inversely proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "a radiation whose spectrum is such that the relative abundance of its photons is inversely proportional to the cubes of their wavelengths , implies a distribution of energy which is inversely proportional to their fourth power . in 1969 , timothy h. boyer showed that the function of spectral density of zero - point radiation is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number expressing the measurement of wavelength @xmath13 [ 1 ] .",
    "this function means that the energy of the flow of photons of wavelength @xmath13 is : @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "there must therefore exist a minimum wavelength , @xmath20 , to which there corresponds the maximum frequency @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "starting from the hypothesis proposed in [ 1 ] , we reached in that paper the equation ( 6 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coefficient of reflection , @xmath25 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the units of length and time in the @xmath28 system , in which the basic magnitudes are electron charge , electron mass and the speed of light .",
    "finally , @xmath0 is the distance between the plates , expressed in @xmath26 , and @xmath29 the amount of @xmath30 , which elapse between the arrival of one photon of wavelength @xmath20 , and the arrival of the next one ( equation ( 3 ) in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] ) . from this equation",
    ", we arrived , in [ 2 ] , at : @xmath31 ( last equation on p. 3 of [ 2 ] ) .    by equating @xmath32 with sparnaay s observations ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath34 , the only values possible for @xmath29 are @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for @xmath35 , @xmath37 ; for @xmath36 , @xmath38 , which is improbable for wavelengths near to @xmath39 cm .    if we incorporate @xmath35 into ( 1 ) , the number 0.407513 must correspond to : @xmath40 , whence @xmath41 and the last equation on p. 3 of [ 2 ] can be written as : @xmath42 in which @xmath0 is the distance between the plates in cm .",
    "when we introduce the numbers @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 g@xmath3cm@xmath3s@xmath5 we obtain @xmath47 .",
    "sparnaay had to make his measurements with uncharged plates , because if they had been charged , the electrostatic repulsion between them would have affected the issue . keeping this in mind",
    ", we can imagine the theoretical sheme shown in fig .",

    "arriving respectively one of them close to @xmath59 , and the other close to @xmath60 , different sensors will connect them to a line of discharge , at which sparnaay s forces will come into play , causing them to approach each other .",
    "it is at this part of the cycle , when the plates move towards each other , where we could make use of a small fraction of the energy flow of zero - point radiation .",
