    "polar - ring galaxies ( prg s ) are systems with two kinematically distinct components .",
    "the central component ( the `` host galaxy '' ) is usually a small s0 galaxy , or occasionally an elliptical galaxy , and the outer component ( the `` polar ring '' ) is a ring or annulus of material in a nearly circumpolar orbit about the host .",
    "the fact that the angular momentum vectors of the host galaxy and of the polar ring are nearly orthogonal indicates that prg s are most likely the end products of mergers or accretion events , rather than a single coherent formation process .",
    "the polar - ring catalog ( @xcite , hereafter prc ) classifies 6 galaxies as kinematically - confirmed polar rings ( category `` a '' in the prc ) , and 27 galaxies as `` probable '' polar rings based upon their optical appearance ( category `` b '' in the prc ) .",
    "the catalog is frozen , but some category `` b '' galaxies have since been confirmed since its publication ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the material in polar rings is something of a mystery , because the gas masses involved are so large .",
    "polar rings are gas - rich , with typically a few billion solar masses of  gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and often significant molecular gas and dust as well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the identified polar rings have enough stars that we can see the rings at optical wavelengths , and stellar rings lie within the rings of neutral gas ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because accreted gas can dissipate energy while the stars can not , gas and stars will tend to settle into very different final configurations .",
    "the stars now in the polar ring must have been formed from the gas after it had settled into the thin ring structure ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the host galaxies are small early - type galaxies , typically with l@xmath3",
    "@xmath4  10@xmath5  m@xmath6 .",
    "there is no evidence that the host galaxies themselves contain substantially more cool gas and dust than other early - type galaxies without polar rings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "their radio continuum emission is not significantly stronger than early - type galaxies without polar rings ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this lack of radio continuum emission indicates that any strong starburst activity which may have been induced by the event that formed the ring has since ceased . even making no allowance for the mass of stars which have formed in the polar rings ,",
    "these galaxies have captured the equivalent of the entire gas content of a typical spiral galaxy ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , hereafter rh94 ) .",
    "it is not clear that a large spiral galaxy could accrete onto a small s0 galaxy without leaving behind a very disorganized system .",
    "if the spiral companion was destroyed , its stars would not dissipate kinetic energy to form a ring as the gas has done , but should be visible as faint shells or diffuse light around the merged system . although some prg s are known to have shells , many prg s do not have visible shells ( prc ) . if the ring material was taken from the outer parts of a spiral galaxy",
    ", then we should be able to see the remains of this companion , but many polar rings have no nearby companions . if the polar ring was formed by accretion of a gas - rich dwarf galaxy , there might be no conspicuous stellar shells , and no visible remnant of the encounter . but dwarf irregular galaxies at the present day contain too little neutral gas to make polar rings ; the upper end of the  mass function for present - day dwarf galaxies is only a few times 10@xmath7  m@xmath6  ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "searches for clouds of primordial intergalactic indicate that there is very little gas in this form at the current epoch ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . if prg s are stable structures , most of them may have formed early in the history of the universe , when large clouds of intergalactic gas should have been more common .    in any case",
    ", it is highly probable that the accretion of material onto many host galaxies is not complete .",
    "the gas of the polar ring has come from an orbit of high angular momentum with a large impact parameter , and it is likely that streamers of gas would remain around most newly - formed polar rings well after the original encounter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the study of probable polar - ring systems which have nearby companions are therefore very likely to reveal gaseous tails or bridges which may help us better understand the interactions which form polar rings .",
    "iizw71  ( ugc  9562 ) is classified as `` b-17 '' , a `` probable '' polar ring system , in the prc .",
    "an optical image of this galaxy and its blue dwarf companion , iizw70 is shown in figure  [ rcont ] ; the polar ring runs ne to sw .",
    "optical spectroscopy in the h@xmath2  emission line of iizw71  by reshetnikov &  combes ( 1994 ) revealed two gaseous components with orbits nearly perpendicular to each other  one with a velocity gradient along the apparent major axis of the polar ring , and another with a velocity gradient along the apparent major axis of the host galaxy .",
    "iizw71  is thus a kinematically - confirmed polar - ring galaxy .",
    "earlier observations of this system by balkowski _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1978 ; hereafter bcw78 ) in the 21 cm line with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) also showed rotation of gas along the polar ring , and in addition detected a cloud of  gas between the two galaxies .",
    "no optical counterpart brighter than 25.5  magarcsec@xmath8 to this cloud was detected in _",
    "the iizw70/71  system is thus one of the best known candidates for a polar ring in the process of formation by accretion of gas from a nearby companion .",
    "we have obtained observations in the 21 cm line of , using the very large array ( vla ) aperture synthesis telescope .",
    "these observations are more sensitive than the observations by bcw78 , and have approximately twice the spatial and velocity resolution .",
    "we have also obtained h@xmath2  and broad - band optical images of this system , to search for evidence of ongoing star formation and for an optical counterpart of the gas cloud between iizw70  and iizw71 . the  distribution and kinematics of the iizw70/71system",
    "are presented in section  [ 21 cm ] , and the optical data in section  [ optical ] . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the morphology of the stars and gas in this system , and investigate the possibility that the polar ring around iizw71  is the product of an ongoing accretion event from gas originating in iizw70 .",
    "we take h@xmath9  =  75  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 , implying a distance of 18.1  mpc for the system .",
    "the iizw70/71  system was observed with the `` c '' and `` d '' configurations of the vla .",
    "the c - configuration data were obtained on 02 december 1994 , and the d - configuration data on 02 may 1995 .",
    "the instrumental parameters for the observations are summarized in table  [ instparms ] .",
    "our velocity resolution was @xmath112.6  km  s@xmath12 . because of the high velocity resolution",
    ", we observed the iizw70/71  system with two independent bandpasses ( if s ) , centered at 1232 &  1268  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "this observing mode allowed us to have a wide enough total bandwidth to include all of the gas in both systems , without sacrificing velocity resolution .",
    "calibration and mapping were performed using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . the data from each configuration and each if were calibrated and continuum - subtracted independently .",
    "standard calibration procedures were followed , as described in appendix b of the _ aips cookbook _ ( @xcite ) . as the if s were separated in velocity space , each if contained channels which were free of line emission on only one side of the bandpass .",
    "a continuum dataset was constructed for each if by averaging together the line - free channels in the _ u , v _  plane ; this dataset was subtracted from all channels in that if to give one continuum - subtracted set of line data for each if .",
    "this method of continuum subtraction assumes that the continuum spectrum is flat over the bandpass of the observation , and that there are no strong continuum sources .",
    "both of these criteria were satisfied by this dataset .",
    "faint 21 cm continuum emission was detected at the positions of iizw70and iizw71 ; a continuum map is shown in figure  [ rcont ] , and the nature of this emission is discussed further in section  [ continuum ] .",
    "after continuum subtraction , the end channels were discarded and all four datasets ( two if s for each configuration ) were combined in the _ u , v_plane to yield a single , continuum - subtracted dataset for the iizw70/71system .",
    "maps were made and corrected for instrumental response using the robust imaging task , imagr .",
    "robust weighting improves the shape of the synthesized beam dramatically for multi - configuration datasets , as these data have even higher concentrations of short baselines than single - configuration data ( @xcite ; see also section  5.2.3 of the _ aips cookbook _ ) .",
    "the resulting channel maps have a spatial resolution of 22.5@xmath1320 , and include structures with sizes up to 10 ; they are shown in figure  [ chanmaps ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ rcont ] , faint 21 cm continuum emission was detected at the positions of iizw71  and its companion galaxy , iizw70 .",
    "the emission observed in iizw71  is centered on an  region in the polar ring ; no emission is observed in the central portion of the host galaxy . because the continuum map is constructed from an average of the line - free channels , the rms noise in the continuum map is only 0.2  mjy  beam@xmath12 , significantly lower than the rms in the individual line channels ( see table  [ instparms ] ) .",
    "as part of a radio continuum survey of polar - ring galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we have also obtained 6 cm continuum observations of these sources .",
    "the 6 cm observations were made in the vla `` b '' configuration , which gives a synthesized beam of approximately 5 .",
    "the on - source integration time was only 30 minutes , but because of the larger bandwidth of the continuum observations ( 50  mhz ) , the rms noise in the 6 cm maps is 0.09  mjy  beam@xmath12 .",
    "the 6 cm emission which was detected was also unresolved , and at the same positions as the 21 cm emission .",
    "as the sources are unresolved at both wavelengths , differences in baseline coverage between the two sets of observations should not present a problem when calculating radio spectral indices . in both iizw70  and iizw71 ,",
    "the spectral indices ( defined by s  @xmath14 ) are quite steep , with @xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with radio spectral indices of star - forming galaxies ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "faint , steep - spectrum radio continuum emission is not uncommon in polar - ring galaxies ( @xcite ) , and the emission may be either centrally concentrated or extended along the polar ring ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .      using the cleaned map cube at 5.2  km  s@xmath12  velocity resolution , we constructed moment maps of the velocity profile at each point . to improve the sensitivity to low - level extended emission , we first smoothed the entire map cube to 40  resolution .",
    "we then selected the areas which contained real line emission in this smoothed cube , using a two - step process .",
    "first , we applied a uniform flux cutoff to the entire cube , eliminating all pixels with an intensity less than 1  mjy  beam@xmath12  ( twice the rms noise in the smoothed maps ) . to minimize the confusion from noise peaks not related to real line emission",
    ", we then inspected each velocity channel visually , and selected only those areas which appeared to contain line emission , and blanked all other areas .",
    "these smoothed and clipped channel maps were then used as masks ; we calculated moment maps from the cube at full resolution , including only the flux from regions where the smoothed maps were found to have emission , and the flux in the full - resolution maps was above a 2-@xmath16 cutoff level of 0.8  mjy  beam@xmath12 .",
    "the total - intensity map at 21 cm ( figure  [ mom0 ] ) shows significant quantities of neutral gas in the prg ( iizw71 ) , its dwarf companion ( iizw70 ) about 260  away , a streamer which appears to connect the two , and an extension of the gas to the east of the polar ring .",
    "the polar - ring gas extends about 50  to the north and 70  to the south , and looks `` c '' shaped ; the ring seems to bend towards iizw70  at both ends .    figure  [ mom0]b is a position - velocity cut taken along the optical major axis of the polar ring . in general ,",
    "the rotation of the gas is along the ring major axis , but there is a larger spread in velocity and space on the southern side of the ring than on the northern side .",
    "figure  [ mom0]c is plotted along the position angle of the  streamer seen between the two galaxies . to increase our signal - to - noise for the faint streamer ,",
    "the data for this position - velocity profile were summed out to a distance of 15 perpendicular to this axis , on each side of the streamer .",
    "this includes all 21 cm line emission detected in these observations .",
    "the streamer is contiguous with both galaxies , in both position and velocity space  a strong indication of an ongoing interaction between iizw70  and iizw71 .",
    "however , the gas that extends to the east of the polar ring appears to be a continuation of the streamer in both position and velocity , which suggests that the streamer passes in front of the polar ring , or behind it .",
    "the intensity - weighted velocity field for the iizw70/71  system is shown in figure  [ mom1 ] .",
    "the optical appearance of the polar ring in iizw71  suggests that we see it almost edge - on . with a rotation speed of 95 km  s@xmath12",
    ", this gives a dynamical mass of 19 billion m@xmath6  within a 50  distance from the center of the galaxy , or m / l@xmath17 .",
    "this is much larger than the value m / l@xmath18 within 30 , derived by @xcite from long - slit spectroscopy of the ring in h@xmath2 .",
    "the position - velocity cut of figure  [ mom0]b shows no sign that the rotation speed of the ring gas is dropping off , even far outside the optical radius of the host galaxy in iizw71  ( 18 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "thus a significant amount of the mass in this galaxy must be in the form of dark matter .",
    "the gas of the companion galaxy , iizw70 , exhibits regular rotation about its apparent optical minor axis .",
    "this is in contrast with the earlier observations by bcw78 , where the rotation appeared to be skewed from the minor axis , so that the kinematic major axis was oriented almost exactly east - west .",
    "however , their observations probably confused gas associated with iizw70  with that from the streamer of  between the two galaxies .",
    "this problem is reduced in the current observations by our improved spatial resolution ( @xmath11  21  for these observations , compared with @xmath11  34  for the observations of bcw78 ) .",
    "if iizw70  is also seen close to edge - on , our observed rotation speed of 67 km  s@xmath12  within a 45  radius gives a dynamical mass of 8.3 billion m@xmath6  for this galaxy .",
    "a 21 cm line profile for this system was derived by summing the flux for each channel over the area containing line emission in the 21 cm total - intensity map of figure  [ mom0 ] .",
    "the 21 cm spectrum for the entire region is shown as a solid line in figure  [ spectrum ] .",
    "the total  gas mass we derive for this system is @xmath19  m@xmath6 , consistent with the results from bcw78 and @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm spectrum is very asymmetric , without the typical double - horned shape typical of spiral galaxies and other prg s .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , however , as gas from the entire system is included , and the gas in the ring is not symmetric about the galaxy center .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ mom0 ] , it was impossible to distinguish the emission from iizw71  from that of the  streamer in all of the velocity channels .",
    "we constructed approximate line profiles for each of the components by selecting regions for iizw70  and iizw71  in the total - intensity map and assuming that all emission in these regions belongs to these galaxies , and not to the streamer .",
    "the resulting global profiles for each component are shown as dashed lines in the figure .",
    "because of the method we used in determining these profiles , the amount of gas belonging to iizw71  in the 12501300  km  s@xmath12  velocity range is probably an overestimate , while in the same velocity range we underestimate the amount of gas in the  streamer .",
    "based upon these global profiles , we estimate that 20%  of the neutral hydrogen is associated with iizw70 , 25%  with the streamer , and the remaining 55%  with the polar ring around iizw71 . based upon the use of a variety of different boxes for these regions , we estimate that the uncertainty introduced by our separation methods to be 10% .    for the dwarf galaxy iizw70 , we derive m@xmath20/l@xmath3@xmath110.3 .",
    "though substantial , the  mass of iizw71  is one of the smallest gas masses associated with known prgs ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; see section  [ intro ] ) .",
    "however , it is also rather small , and faint at optical wavelengths ; so the ratio m@xmath20/l@xmath3@xmath110.55 is only slightly below the median for confirmed polar rings ( @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies are both rather gas - rich , with values of m@xmath20/l@xmath3 typical of late - type spirals or gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxies ( rh94 ; see table  [ physq ] ) . for the polar ring",
    "considered alone , m@xmath20/l@xmath3@xmath112.4 , which is more typical of the blue low - surface - brightness disk galaxies in the sample of @xcite : see figures  6 and 7 .",
    "optical images of the iizw70/71  system were obtained with the 1.8-meter perkins telescope of the ohio wesleyan university and the ohio state university at lowell observatory .",
    "we used the ohio state university imaging fabry - perot spectrometer , without an etalon , as a focal - reducing camera .",
    "observations were conducted on the night of 1995 april 8 through variable cirrus , and we obtained images totaling 5400 s in @xmath21 , 1800 s in @xmath22 , 2100 s in @xmath23 , and 5400 s in a narrow - band h@xmath2 filter .",
    "we observed again on the night of 1995 june 5 under photometric conditions and obtained shorter exposures in the same filters .",
    "the june images were calibrated using standards from landolt ( 1983 ) and barnes & hayes ( 1982 ) and this calibration was transfered to our deeper april data using field stars .",
    "we produced a continuum - free h@xmath2 image by scaling and subtracting the @xmath23 image .",
    "table  [ mags ] gives our derived magnitudes and colors .    in the @xmath21 band image , and the @xmath24 color map of figure  [ bvimages ] , the polar ring appears very bumpy , with bright knots along it .",
    "there is also strong bending of the ring component , beginning fairly close to the central galaxy .",
    "the ring is also asymmetric , with the northern side brighter than the southern side .",
    "the close companion , iizw70 , has irregular plumes extending from the main body at optical wavelengths .",
    "our exposures were not deep enough to improve on the limit derived by bcw78 for an optical counterpart to the gas streamer .",
    "the global colors of both galaxies are similar to those of late - type spiral galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , rh94 ) . the blue color of iizw71 , however , is partly due to the light from the polar ring .",
    "we averaged in boxes over representative portions of the polar ring and the host galaxy ( see figure  [ bvimages ] ) , and found @xmath25 for the host galaxy , while the ring is much bluer , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the ring is significantly bluer than average for the disk of a late - type galaxy in the sample of de jong ( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "however , both its color and its gas content are similar to the gas - rich low - surface - brightness disks of @xcite ; the outer disks of the blue low - surface - brightness galaxies of @xcite also have similar optical colors .",
    "the total @xmath22-band magnitude of iizw71  ( @xmath28 ) puts it about a magnitude below the mean tully - fisher relation defined by bright galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , iizw71  lies approximately on the tully - fisher relation for gas - rich extreme late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) , which have similar ratios of m@xmath20/l@xmath3 .",
    "the continuum - subtracted h@xmath2  image of iizw70  in figure  [ bvimages ] shows ongoing star formation in the center .",
    "we also see filamentary h@xmath2  emission in the southwestern plume , but not in the northeastern plume .",
    "our measured line flux of @xmath29erg  cm@xmath8  s@xmath10 yields a total energy output of @xmath31  erg  s@xmath10 in h@xmath2 . assuming that the initial mass function follows salpeter s form , we can use kennicutt s ( 1998 ) recipe to infer that iizw70  is producing 0.2m@xmath6  yr@xmath10 of new stars . at this rate",
    ", it would have taken 3  @xmath13  ( m / l@xmath3 )  gyr to make the galaxy s present population of stars , where m / l@xmath3 is the mass - to - light ratio in solar units .",
    "if the rate stays constant in the future , and we neglect gas recycled from aging stars , then the observed  gas will be exhausted in 0.9  gyr ; this timescale is typical of starbursting irregulars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath2  emission of iizw71  is from bright knots throughout the polar ring .",
    "the knot near the center could be either an  region in the ring that is simply projected close to the center , or within the central galaxy itself .",
    "the ring emission is asymmetric .",
    "even though the  gas is more extended to the south , the northern half of the ring is much stronger in h@xmath2 , and is also the region where we detected the radio continuum emission shown in figure 1 .",
    "the measured h@xmath2  flux of @xmath32erg  cm@xmath8  s@xmath10 is significantly larger than that estimated by reshetnikov &  combes ( 1994 ) from their slit spectrum .",
    "it translates to a total of @xmath33  erg  s@xmath10 in h@xmath2 , corresponding to only 0.035m@xmath6  yr@xmath10 of new stars .",
    "although the polar ring has almost the same colors as iizw70 , it is making its stars much more slowly , at a pace more typical of irregular galaxies ( @xcite ) . at this rate",
    ", the observed   gas would be consumed only over 14  gyr , while it would have taken 6  @xmath13  ( m / l@xmath3 )  gyr to make the ring s present population of stars . however , figure  3 of @xcite , using models in which star formation increases or decreases monotonically in time , shows that the ring s observed blue color corresponds to a constant , or even rising , rate of starbirth .",
    "thus despite its messy appearance , the ring in iizw71  is likely to be considerably older that the @xmath11  1  gyr suggested on morphological grounds by reshetnikov &  combes .",
    "we observe  gas in regular rotation about the minor axis of the optical polar ring in iizw71 , and none that shares the rotation of the s0 disk .",
    "iizw71  is thus a confirmed polar - ring galaxy .",
    "the amount of  is fairly modest , compared with other polar rings ( @xcite ) , but is much greater than normal for an s0 galaxy , and is more typical of a late - type spiral or large irregular galaxy ( @xcite ) . as with other polar rings ,",
    "the extent of the  gas is greater than that of the optical ring .",
    "the rotation curve does not drop , even far outside the optical radius of the host galaxy . as in other polar - ring galaxies",
    ", it appears that most of the mass in this galaxy is dark ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the polar ring of iizw71  is asymmetric , at both optical and radio wavelengths .",
    "in addition , observations at h@xmath2  show clumpy emission in the ring .",
    "this emission is more pronounced on the northern side of the galaxy , the same side on which faint , steep - spectrum radio continuum emission is observed .",
    "the presence of both h@xmath2  emission and radio continuum emission along the ring , and its blue color , are strong arguments for ongoing star formation .",
    "the asymmetry of the ring material and the evidence of star formation in the ring make it likely that new material has recently been added to the polar ring , or that pre - existing ring material has recently been disturbed by a new interaction .    at our assumed distance of 18.1  mpc",
    ", the projected separation of 4.4  between these two galaxies corresponds to a separation of @xmath11  23  kpc . at a relative speed of 100  km  s@xmath12",
    ", it would have taken these galaxies at least 230  myr to separate after a close interaction .",
    "the orbital timescale for gas in the outer regions of iizw71  is about 200  myr , implying that the most recent interaction between these two galaxies may have taken place within a few orbital timescales .",
    "was the polar ring of iizw71  formed by accretion from the companion galaxy iizw70 ?",
    "the two galaxies are smoothly connected in both position and velocity by a gaseous bridge or streamer , in which we observe no stellar component .",
    "assuming that the bridge is the remnant of the interaction that created the polar ring , so that all of the gas from the polar ring and streamer originally belonged to iizw70 , would yield @xmath34 prior to the interaction  a high , but not unreasonable , value for an irregular galaxy .",
    "since the dynamical mass of iizw71  is more than twice that of iizw70 , the outer layers of a gas - rich system the size of iizw70  would not have been very tightly bound , and might have been fairly easily detached .    the blue stars and h@xmath2  regions in the polar ring are spread along a line , implying that much of the gas has already settled into a disk or ring , that we now see almost edge - on .",
    "it is difficult to explain how gas that was accreted only a few orbital timescales ago could have already settled into a plane . if there were enough dissipation to cause flattening on this short timescale , we would expect substantial amounts of accreted gas to be falling into the center of the host galaxy , and either forming stars there , or fueling a central black hole . however , this does not seem to be the case .",
    "our observations reveal no radio continuum source , and the far - infrared iras flux is also low ( prc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ionized gas of the central galaxy does not share the rotation axis of the ring material ( @xcite ) , so it is unlikely to have come from the ring .",
    "the contiguous streamer of gas between iizw70  and iizw71 , as well as the star formation activity in both iizw70  and the polar ring , indicate an ongoing interaction between these two galaxies .",
    "however , the fact that hi gas to the east of the polar ring appears to be a continuation of the streamer to the west , in both position and velocity , implies that the streamer probably lies behind iizw71  or in front of it , rather than merging into the polar ring .",
    "that is not what we would expect if both the polar ring and the streamer originated in the same , recent , accretion event .",
    "a further indication that the ring itself has existed for some time comes from the relatively weak h@xmath2  emission . at the present rate of star formation",
    ", it would take several gigayears to build up the stars that we now observe in the ring , while the blue color indicates that starbirth was no more rapid in the past than it is now .",
    "we suggest instead that the polar ring of iizw71  predated the most recent close passage of iizw70 , but was disturbed by it . just as in the disks of spiral galaxies ( larson & tinsley 1978 , mihos & hernquist 1996 , barton , geller & kenyon 2000 ) , tidal torques",
    "have ` rejuvenated ' the ring , causing the vigorous star formation that we now observe .",

    "<S> this gaseous bridge , plus our observations of h@xmath2  line emission in the polar ring and in iizw71 , are strong evidence for an ongoing interaction between the two galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the configuration of the streamer suggests that the polar ring itself may well have predated the current interaction , which then stimulated an outburst of star formation in the ring gas . </S>"
