    "the correlation between black - hole mass and bulge luminosity is now well established for both active and inactive galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; laor 1998 ) .",
    "however , despite recent attention in the literature , the usefulness of the @xmath2 relation as a black - hole mass estimator is at present severely limited due to its large scatter ( @xmath8 dex ) .",
    "although the correlation between black - hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion for nearby inactive galaxies displays a much smaller scatter ( @xmath9 dex , merritt & ferrarese 2001a ) , it is clear that a @xmath2 correlation with reduced scatter would be highly desirable , given the extreme difficulty in obtaining stellar velocity dispersions for high redshift galaxies .",
    "this conference proceeding presents the main results of a new study ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ) in which we investigate the black hole - bulge mass relation using a 90-object sample comprised of 72 agn ( 53 qsos and 19 seyfert 1s ) and 18 nearby quiescent ellipticals with dynamically determined black - hole mass estimates .",
    "those interested in the details of our analysis , particularly the flattened geometry model adopted for the calculation of the virial black - hole mass estimates , are referred to mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) .",
    "band bulge magnitude versus black - hole mass for the full 90-object sample .",
    "the black - hole masses for the 72 agn are derived from their h@xmath10 line - widths under a disc - like blr model ( see mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "the black - hole masses of the inactive galaxies ( triangles ) are dynamical estimates as compiled by kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) .",
    "also shown is the formal best - fit ( solid line ) and the best - fitting linear relation ( dotted line ) . ]    in fig [ fig1 ] absolute @xmath11band bulge magnitude is plotted against black - hole mass for the 72 objects in the agn sample . also shown",
    "is absolute @xmath11band bulge magnitude plotted against dynamically - estimated black - hole mass for our nearby inactive elliptical galaxy sample .",
    "several aspects of fig [ fig1 ] are worthy of immediate comment .",
    "firstly , as was shown by mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) and by laor ( 1998 & 2001 ) , it can be seen that bulge luminosity and black - hole mass are extremely well correlated , with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "secondly , it is clear that the agn and nearby inactive galaxy samples follow the same @xmath2 relation over @xmath14 decades in black - hole mass , and @xmath15 decades in bulge luminosity .",
    "this second fact strongly supports the conclusions of dunlop et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and wisotzki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , that the host - galaxies of powerful quasars are normal massive ellipticals drawn from the bright end of the elliptical galaxy luminosity function .",
    "thirdly , there can be seen to be no systematic offset between the seyfert 1 and quasar samples , reinforcing the finding of mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) that , contrary to the results of wandel ( 1999 ) , the bulges of seyfert galaxies and qsos form a continuous sequence which ranges from @xmath16(bulge)@xmath17 to @xmath16(bulge)@xmath18 . if we adopt an integrated value of @xmath19 ( lin et al .",
    "1998 ) , then this implies that the @xmath2 relation holds from @xmath20 , all the way up to objects which constitute some of the most massive ellipticals ever formed ; @xmath21 .",
    "the best - fit to the full 90-object sample has the following form : @xmath22 and is shown as the solid line in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "the scatter around this best - fitting relation is only @xmath23 dex , an uncertainty factor of @xmath24 .",
    "the reduced scatter found here in comparison to previous studies is due to two factors .",
    "firstly , all of the bulge luminosities used in this study are derived from full two - dimensional modelling of high resolution data , the majority of which is from hst .",
    "the second factor is the inclination corrections to the black - hole mass estimates provided by our flattened - geometry blr model .",
    "both of these aspects are discussed in detail in mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) .",
    "given that the 18 objects in the nearby inactive galaxy sample have actual dynamical black - hole mass estimates , it is obviously of interest to quantitatively test how consistent the @xmath2 relation for these objects is with the fit to the full , agn dominated , sample .",
    "the best - fit to the inactive galaxy sub - sample alone , has the following form : @xmath25 which can be seen to be perfectly consistent with the best - fit to the full sample in terms of both slope and normalization .",
    "indeed , the best - fitting relations for the full sample , quasar sample , seyfert galaxy sample and the nearby inactive galaxy sample are all internally consistent , and display comparable levels of scatter .",
    "this is a remarkable result given that it implies that the combined bulge / black hole formation process was essentially the same throughout the full sample , which as well as featuring both active and inactive galaxies , includes galaxies of both late and early - type morphology .",
    "in our previous study ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ) of a sample of 45 agn we found that @xmath26 , and therefore concluded that there was no evidence that the @xmath3 relation was non - linear .",
    "in contrast , evidence for a non - linear relation was recently found by laor ( 2001 ) . in his @xmath27band study of the black hole to bulge mass relation in a 40-object sample ( 15 pg quasars , 16 inactive galaxies and 9 seyfert galaxies ) laor found a best - fitting relation of the form @xmath28 , which is clearly inconsistent with linearity .",
    "however , in order to determine the @xmath3 relation it is obviously necessary to convert the measured bulge luminosities into masses , via an adopted mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the form of this mass - to - light ratio affects the derived slope of the @xmath3 relation in the following way .",
    "if the mass - to - light ratio is parameterized as @xmath29 , then the resulting slope ( @xmath30 ) of the @xmath3 relation is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath10 is the slope of the @xmath2 relation ( eqn 1 ) .",
    "here we choose to adopt the derived @xmath11band mass - to - light ratio for the coma cluster from j@xmath32rgensen , franx & kj@xmath33rgaard ( 1996 ) , which has @xmath34 . with this mass - to - light ratio",
    "our best - fitting @xmath2 relation transforms to a @xmath3 relation of the following form : @xmath35 it can immediately be seen that from our results there is no indication that the scaling between black hole and bulge mass is non - linear .    in order to calculate the bulge mass of the objects in his sample , laor ( 2001 )",
    "adopted a @xmath27band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath36 ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is significantly different from our chosen mass - to - light ratio .",
    "however , irrespective of this , our new best - fit to the slope of the @xmath2 relation ( @xmath37 ) of our new sample , which has a larger dynamic range in @xmath1 than both the samples studied in mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) and laor ( 2001 ) , means that any disagreement about mass - to - light ratios can not now alter the conclusion that the @xmath3 relation is consistent with being linear . to demonstrate this",
    "we conclude by noting that even using the @xmath36 mass - to - light ratio adopted by laor ( 2001 ) , our best - fitting @xmath2 relation is equivalent to @xmath38 , again , completely consistent with a linear scaling .     and standard deviation 0.45 ( see text for discussion ) ]",
    "having established that the @xmath3 relation is consistent with being linear , we now assume perfect linearity in order to establish the normalization of the @xmath3 relation . with the mass - to - light ratio adopted here , a linear scaling corresponds to enforcing a slope of @xmath39 in the @xmath40 vs. @xmath16 relation . under this restriction",
    "the best - fitting relation has a normalization of @xmath4 , and can clearly be seen to be an excellent representation of the data ( fig 1 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the normalization of @xmath4 is identical to that determined by merritt & ferrarese ( 2001b ) from their velocity dispersion study of the 32 inactive galaxies in the magorrian et al .",
    "sample .",
    "the closeness of the agreement between the @xmath41 ratios determined here with those determined by merritt & ferrarese is highlighted by fig [ fig2 ] , which shows a histogram of the @xmath41 distribution for our 72-object agn sample .",
    "the agn @xmath41 distribution has @xmath42 with a standard deviation of @xmath43 .",
    "this is in remarkably good agreement with the merritt & ferrarese results , which were @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we note that the normalization of @xmath4 agrees very well with the predictions of recent models of coupled bulge / black hole formation at high redshift ( archibald et al .",
    "band bulge magnitude versus dynamical black - hole mass estimate for our inactive galaxy sample .",
    "the solid line is the best - fitting relation ( @xmath46 ) and the dotted line is the best - fitting linear relation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the right - hand panel is the same with bulge luminosity replaced by stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the solid line is the best - fit ( @xmath47 ) , the dashed line is the merritt & ferrarese ( 2001a ) relation ( @xmath48 ) , and the dot - dashed line is the gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) relation ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the location of the milky way and m31 are indicated for the interest of the reader , although neither were included in the analysis . ]",
    "the quality of the fit to the inactive galaxy sample is illustrated by the left - hand panel of fig [ fig3 ] , which shows the @xmath2 relation for the inactive galaxy sample alone .",
    "of particular interest is the scatter around this best - fit relation , given that it has been widely reported in the literature ( eg .",
    "merritt & ferrarese 2001a , kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) that the scatter around the @xmath2 relation is significantly greater than that around the @xmath7 relation .",
    "however , in contrast , we find that the scatter around the @xmath2 relation for our sample of nearby inactive galaxies , which excludes non e - type morphologies , is only @xmath6 dex , in excellent agreement with the scatter around the @xmath7 relation ( merritt & ferrarese 2001a ) .    to test this result further , in the right - hand panel of fig [ fig3 ] , we investigate the @xmath7 relation for our nearby inactive galaxy sample .",
    "the scatter around the best - fit relation ( @xmath50 ) is 0.30 dex , leading us to the conclusion that the intrinsic scatter around the @xmath2 relation for _ elliptical _ galaxies is comparable to that in the m@xmath51 relation .",
    "the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows :    * the best - fitting @xmath2 relation to the combined sample of 72 agn and 18 nearby inactive elliptical galaxies is found to be consistent with a linear scaling between black hole and bulge mass ( @xmath52 ) , and to have much lower scatter than previously reported ( @xmath5 dex ) . *",
    "the best - fitting normalization of the @xmath3 relation is found to be @xmath4 , in excellent agreement with recent stellar velocity dispersion studies . * in contrast to previous reports it is found that the scatter around the @xmath2 and @xmath7 relations for nearby inactive elliptical galaxies are comparable , at only @xmath53 dex .",
