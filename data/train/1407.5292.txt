    "the lagrangian manifolds of the first type are the integral manifold of @xmath62 passing above @xmath63 . from now on we assume that in local coordinates near @xmath29 , @xmath64 .",

    "lagrangian manifolds of the second type are the invariant tori foliating ( locally ) the energy surface in the integrable case , or kam tori , or corresponding quasi - invariant tori in the quasi - integrable case . in the section 6",

    "we can have already a good insight into the problem in replacing @xmath0 by its quadratic approximation .",
    "this is what we call the _ model case_. when frequencies @xmath94 are rationally independent , we can essentially reduce to the model case by resorting to birkhoff normal forms ( or kam theorem ) .",

    "the caustics of @xmath97 can be viewed as a rectangle shaped fold line delimiting the zone of pure oscillations of the quasi - modes , and touching the boundary of the wells @xmath69 , @xmath98 at 4 vertices , the hyperbolic umbilic points ( hu ) points , section of the torus by the plane @xmath101 in @xmath102 .",

    "of course , in the general case ( not model case ) , tori @xmath97 or @xmath110 make only sense as asymptotic objects ( via birkhoff normal form ) because they are not invariant under the hamilton vector flow . assuming a diophantine condition on @xmath111 we can also select a dense family of such invariant tori .",
    "[ fig1 ]    if the system were integrable near 0 , because of pt symmetry , the extension of @xmath112 would usually coincide with @xmath113 , the decaying branch of @xmath114 . for a general , non integrable system",
    ", there is no reason for this holds and @xmath115 intersects @xmath116 along a one dimensional manifold .",
    "assume again there is only one libration @xmath79 .",
    "we call the lift @xmath77 of @xmath79 the tunnel cycle .",
    "we call the bicharacteristic @xmath117 a tunnel bicharacteristic if there are @xmath118 , with @xmath98 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "we say also that @xmath121 are in correspondence along @xmath122 .",
    "the tunnel cycle is a tunnel bicharacteristic for which @xmath121 are umbilics , but it carries generally no interaction between wells , unless @xmath121 belong to quantized tori .",
    "but in a small , @xmath123-dependent neighborhood of @xmath77 there are tunnel bicharacteristics that carry interaction between wells ( but generally do not close ) .",
    "non degeneracy of the tunnel cycle then implies the following :    consider the model case .",
    "when @xmath98 we have @xmath124 with a clean intersection .",
    "it follows from ( [ gam_y],[gam_e ] ) that along the tunnel cycle @xmath79 we have simultaneously @xmath125 and @xmath126 with clean intersections .    unlike @xmath69 ,",
    "the caustics of @xmath73 which is a smooth set , the caustics of @xmath99 issued from @xmath103 is a stratified set consisting of the umbilic @xmath103 , and lines @xmath127 , @xmath128 tangent at @xmath103 to the principal directions of @xmath129 .",
    "these caustics sets are the envelopes of lissajous figures , whose lifts are ( real ) bicharacteristics of @xmath62 .",
    "non degeneracy of the tunnel cycle @xmath77 implies also the following splitting from ( [ gam_e ] )  :    let @xmath77 be a minimal tunnel cycle , with end points @xmath130 , intersecting @xmath1 at @xmath131 , with @xmath132 . for @xmath133 close to @xmath130 , let @xmath134 and @xmath135 denote the lagrangian manifold as above with hu @xmath103 .",

    "\\2 ) @xmath142 is a tunnel bicharacteristic @xmath143 , transverse to @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 intersects orthogonally @xmath1 at @xmath147 .",
    "moreover @xmath143 projects at some @xmath148 to @xmath149 tangentially to the caustics @xmath150 ( both for l and r ) .",
    "thus @xmath77 , which was common to both @xmath151 and @xmath152 , splits into 2 distinct curves : ( 1 ) the lift of the libration at energy @xmath153 , ( 2 ) a tunnel bicharacteristic passing through the regular part of @xmath150 .",
    "because the action along @xmath143 gives the tunneling rate when @xmath154 supports a quasi - mode we introduce the :    the action @xmath155 computed on @xmath143 is called the tunnel distance between @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( it equals agmon distance when @xmath158 .  )    let @xmath159 .",
    "integrating @xmath160 along @xmath108 gives ( locally ) agmon distance to the well  : @xmath161 denote by @xmath162 the rhs of this equation ; provided @xmath163 is not too close to both @xmath33-axis , one can show that @xmath164 is estimated by the square of the ( euclidean ) distance of @xmath71 to its orthogonal projection on @xmath108 , for @xmath71 in a neighborhood of @xmath79 .",
    "similarly we consider variations from the regular part of the caustics @xmath150 @xmath165 , with @xmath166 , and write the critical value as @xmath167 , or simply @xmath168 . again",
    "@xmath169 , where @xmath170 , @xmath171 is a small error term essentially independent of @xmath71 in a neighborhood of @xmath79 .",
    "the next step consists in constructing quasi - modes .",
    "first we construct quasi - modes microlocalized on the @xmath97 selecting a sequence @xmath172 from bohr - sommerfeld - maslov ( or ebk ) quantization rules . as a rule , these ( oscillating )",
    "quasi - modes extend in the shadow zone near @xmath173 with exponential decay .",
    "they can further be extended to @xmath174 and @xmath175 along @xmath176 using wkb expansions , or the `` gaussian beams '' method .",
    "the eigenvalue splitting is given by the usual formula @xmath177 where @xmath178 is a neighborhood of @xmath86 in @xmath1 .",
    "we now treat some specific cases in more detail .",
    "assume @xmath44 is so small that kam theory ensures existence of a family invariant tori in the well @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath181 for @xmath182 near such fixed @xmath96 .",
    "assume that @xmath79 starts at umbilic @xmath183 away from the @xmath33-axis , and for simplicity , that @xmath184 with @xmath104 in the kam set , i.e. such that the motion on @xmath97 is quasi - periodic with diophantine frequency vector @xmath185 ( this assumption seems to be generic , varying slightly @xmath7 ) . in @xcite , we proved the following  : let @xmath60 .",
    "then in a @xmath186-neighborhood of @xmath97 in @xmath187 , there is a family @xmath188 of tori , labelled by their action variables @xmath189 for @xmath190 satisfying @xmath191 , which verify bohr - sommerfeld - maslov quantization condition , and are quasi - invariant under @xmath192 with an accuracy @xmath193 . at first approximation ,",
    "the umbilics @xmath194 have the form @xmath195 or @xmath196 so the typical neighboring distance between @xmath173 is @xmath197 when @xmath183 stays away from the @xmath33-axis .",
    "using maslov canonical operator , we obtain from these tori a sequence of quasi - modes for @xmath10 near @xmath7 . by complex contour integrals ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) they extend in a @xmath198- neighborhood of @xmath65 , as states microlocalized on @xmath199 , and decaying exponentially as @xmath200 $ ] , or @xmath201 $ ] .",
    "this decay propagates all along @xmath176 and nearby bicharacteristics , which stay in the purely decaying branch @xmath199 of @xmath188 .",
    "next we need to compare the tunnel distance with agmon distance which coincide only on the tunnel cycle .",
    "let @xmath202 be the tunnel action between @xmath203 and @xmath204 , we have at @xmath1 ( see fig.1 ) @xmath205 evaluating each error term on the rhs , we arrive at @xmath206 , @xmath58 .",

    "the integral can be computed by standard stationary phase expansion around @xmath211 .",
