    "the optical and x - ray properties of type ii agn ( i.e. those showing prominent narrow emission lines and very faint , if any , broad lines ) have been discussed in numerous recent papers that contain the analysis of their morphology , spectrum , geometry and relationship to type i ( broad emission line ) agn .",
    "various names , including seyfert 2 , narrow emission line galaxies ( nelg ) , and narrow line x - ray galaxies ( nlxgs ) have been used to describe these objects . obviously , there is some subjectivity in the classification of type ii agn leading to the assignment of a more than one `` type '' for some objects which have been studied by several authors .",
    "the geometry of the innermost region of such sources is a fundamental , yet still an open issue and the reader is referred to antonucci ( 1993 ) , and mulchaey  ( 1994 ) for discussion and references regarding these questions .",
    "x - ray observations offer a unique view of type ii agn , since x - rays can penetrate large column densities .",
    "this has been a subject of much research , for example , see recent papers by turner  ( 1997a , b,1998 ) .",
    "these authors found some surprising similarities between the x - ray spectra of type i and type ii agn . in some type",
    "ii sources , the equivalent width ( ew ) of the 6.4 kev line is similar to that observed in seyfert 1s and the line profiles show broad , redshifted wings . in other type",
    "ii sources , like ngc  1068 , ew(fe ) is an order of magnitude larger than in type i agn , suggesting that the line is seen against a reduced continuum , presumably due to obscuration .",
    "evidently , type ii agn fall into at least two x - ray categories ; those where the central source is directly observed below 10 kev , and those where it is not .",
    "hereafter we refer to those type ii agn whose 0.510 kev spectra are dominated by scattered radiation , `` scattering  dominated agn '' , and they are the subject of this paper .",
    "we expect a good , but not necessarily a one - to - one correlation between such objects and those type ii agn who show highly polarized continuum and broad optical / uv emission lines , due to scattering ( e.g. tran 1995 ) .",
    "this paper investigates the properties of scattering  dominated agn through detailed analysis of their 0.510 kev spectrum .",
    "we address the nature of the scattering medium and try to deduce its level of ionization , column density and covering fraction .",
    "we also investigate the metallicity of the gas and compare its properties to the ionized gas in seyfert 1 galaxies , and to the narrow line region ( nlr ) gas .",
    "the analysis is aimed at a small number of scattering  dominated agn whose  spectra are of a sufficiently high quality to enable the measurement of at least 3 x - ray emission lines .",
    "it also suggests several new avenues for future study of such sources in preparation for the coming _ axaf _  and _ xmm _  missions . in ",
    "2 we discuss the predicted spectra of such sources . in ",
    "3 we compare predictions to a detailed analysis of the  spectra of six such galaxies . in ",
    "4 we discuss several implications of such a comparison , and implications for the state and the location of the scattering medium and its composition .",
    "in this section we show new calculations pertaining to scattering  dominated agn .",
    "the calculations assume a simple geometry of a point - like source of x - ray and uv radiation surrounded by gas clouds of various locations , density and column density .",
    "the gas is photoionized by the radiation of the central source and no other excitation is assumed .",
    "the geometry is such that the line - of - sight to the central source is completely covered by a column density of 10@xmath8  or larger but the scattering medium has a clear view of the center and we have a clear view of the scattering gas .",
    "the parameters of the model are the gas covering factor , = @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the solid angle subtended at central source , density , column density , and the gas location .",
    "we shall make extensive use of the `` x - ray ionization parameter '' , ux=@xmath11 ( netzer 1996 ) , where @xmath12 is the incident photon flux in the 0.110 kev band .",
    "this parameter is closely related to the ionization level of most observed highly ionized species .",
    "conversion factors between ux and the u@xmath13 ionization parameter ( defined over the entire lyman continuum ) , are given in george  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the scattering gas is assumed to be distributed in a shell geometry and is made of a large number of small clouds with dimensions similar to the shell thickness .",
    "the shell is not complete since the obscurer ( possibly a torus ? ) subtends a non - negligible solid angle as viewed from the center . for simplicity , we assume that ux and  are the same for all clouds .",
    "all scattering and emission processes are assumed to be isotropic and the photons emitted from the cloud and reaching the observer are both those which leak between the clouds and those transmitted through the clouds . for a uniform distribution of small clouds ,",
    "the relative fraction of the two ( i.e. the leaking photons and the attenuated ones ) is uniquly specified by the covering factor .",
    "the real situation can be rather more complex .",
    "for example , a geometry of @xmath14 may involve extra absorption of _ all _ emitted photons .",
    "this can happen if a single large cloud is situated just outside the main scattering region , on the line of sight .",
    "in such a case , all emitted and scattered photons suffer extra attenuation on the way out .",
    "the present calculations do not include such complications .",
    "the calculations presented here were performed using the photoionization code ` ion97 ` .",
    "this code includes a full treatment of all important ir , optical , uv and x - ray transitions and solves , simultaneously , for the level of ionization , temperature and opacity of the exposed gas . for a full description and more references see netzer ( 1996 ) .",
    "the calculations assume two `` canonical '' spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "we describe those either by the energy slope @xmath15 , i.e. where the luminosity , l@xmath16 , is related to the energy , e , as ( l@xmath17 ) or the photon slope where the number of photons , n , at energy e is given by @xmath18 ( n@xmath19 ) .",
    "the first has a uv bump centered at 40 ev , a soft ( e@xmath20100 ev ) x - ray component of @xmath21 changing gradually to a hard x - ray slope of @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio of the two continuum components at 1  kev is soft(x - ray)/hard(x - ray)=0.5 . for this",
    "sed , = 1.38 .",
    "the second sed has a similar uv bump but a much flatter hard x - ray slope of @xmath23 . in this case",
    "= 1.13 , typical of low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the fiducial gas density is @xmath24  which adequately represents the physical conditions over the density range of 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath26 .",
    "unless otherwised specified , the following standard metallicity ( which is similar to solar metallicity ) is assumed throughout : + h : he : c : n : o : ne : mg : si : s : ar : fe=10@xmath27:1000:3.7:1.1:8:1.1:0.37:0.35:0.16:0.037:0.4 .",
    "the more important ingredients of the model are the ionization parameter ux , which determines the level of ionization and line intensity , the column density , which determines the fraction of the incident radiation absorbed by individual clouds , and a parameter which we name `` reprocessing factor '' , ( e ) .",
    "this energy - dependent parameter , represents the fraction of the radiation of the central source reaching the observer via scattering . for small  and small , it is almost energy independent and",
    "is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the compton optical depth of the clouds .",
    "our aim in this work is to investigate the parameter space occupied by scattering - dominated agn .",
    "thus , the observed continuum must be consistent with the assumed intrinsic sed , the observed line ratios must correctly reflect the various neutral and ionized components , and  must be consistent with the bolometric luminosity of the source .",
    "previous studies have only considered a sub - set of these variables . here",
    "we consider them all self - consistently for the first time .",
    "below we discuss the predicted x - ray lines and scattered continuum .",
    "the absorption of the hard x - rays by iron ions results in fe line emission due to fluorescence ( all ions up to fexxiv ) , resonance line absorption ( ions with ten or fewer electrons ) and recombination . fe  transitions , with about 10 percent the intensity of the corresponding fe  lines , are also emitted .",
    "these processes have been discussed , extensively , in the literature and will not be reviewed here . the reader is referred to kallman and krolik ( 1987 ) , george and fabian ( 1991 ) and leahy and creighton ( 1993 ) for calculations of the fe  lines in neutral gases , and to matt ( 1994 ) and matt , brandt & fabian ( 1996 ) , for cases involving ionized material . `",
    "ion97 ` includes all such processes and the lines are calculated under the assumption of complete isotropy of the scattered radiation .",
    "this simplified assumption can introduce small differences compared with the full , angle dependent calculations ( e.g. matt  1996 , fig .",
    "however , the geometry under consideration is sufficiently complex , and most likely involves a combination of various angles , that we see no reason to consider this additional complication .",
    "the observed ews depend on the level of ionization , the column density , the gas expansion or microturbulent motion ( which determine the resonance line optical depth ) , the incident continuum shape and the iron abundance . unless otherwise specified , all calculations assume microturbulent motion with a line width fixed at the local sound speed , i.e. similar to the hydrogen thermal width .",
    "the calculations are restricted to @xmath30 since the present transfer approximation is not adequate for compton - thick material .",
    "1 shows calculated ew ( ) for `` neutral '' ( fei  xvi ) and he - like ( fexxv ) iron lines , over a range of ionization parameter and column density .",
    "it demonstrates that for large , the maximum ew of the two is comparable .",
    "the reason is that both the scattered continuum and the e@xmath31 kev flux are proportional to the column density of the ionized gas , and the absorption cross sections of the different iron ions are very similar .",
    "( the neutral lines can absorb slightly more photons but the recombination efficiency of the fexxv line is larger than the fluorescence yield of the low ionization ions which compensates for this ) .",
    "this is not the case for small , where ew(fexxv ) is considerably larger due to resonance absorption of continuum photons by the 6.7 kev lines . as to the dependence on ,",
    "see below .",
    "2 shows a detailed dependence of the various  intensities on ux , for the specific column density of 10@xmath32 and = 0.5 .",
    "the equivalent widths shown are measured with respect to the _ scattered continuum _ and are designated ew(gas ) .    as seen from the diagram , _ the summed _",
    "ew ( ) is almost independent of ux , demonstrating that for the assumed gas motion , with the sound - speed line width , resonance absorption is not very important compared with continuum ( otherwise the ews of the iron lines where this process can take place , would be much larger ) .",
    "the reason is the large optical depth in all resonance transitions .",
    "for example , the optical depth of the  line for this  and for ux=10 is about 9 , i.e. resonance absorption is efficient only for turbulent motion exceeding about 1000 km / sec .",
    "we define these transitions to include all lines with @xmath33e@xmath346.4 ev .",
    "the strongest are he - like and h - like lines of the most abundant elements . under the conditions assumed here , most of the emitted flux is due to recombination and resonance absorption is of little significance .",
    "auger excited transitions in ions with more than three electrons can be important too , despite the very small fluorescence yield , because of the larger photon flux at low energies ( netzer and turner 1997 ) .",
    "collisionally dominated lines are usually very weak , because of the low temperature of the photoionized gas .",
    "this is also true for the collisionally - excited fe l - shell lines .",
    "however , the recombination lines due to fe l - shell transitions do make significant contributions to the observed flux around 0.81.2 kev . for the treatment of those lines see netzer ( 1996 ) .",
    "2 shows also the calculated ew(gas ) , as a function of ux , for several soft x - ray lines .",
    "3 shows the relative line intensities obtained by normalizing the line flux to the _ incident _ continuum at a specific energy ( 0.65 kev ) .",
    "this diagram illustrates the processing efficiency of the various lines .",
    "4 gives yet another view of the information presented in fig .",
    "2 , this time over a large range in column density and ionization parameter .    while most ews are not sensitive to the exact value of the covering fraction , this is not the case when  approaches unity .",
    "this can be explained by noting that for optically thin gas , the relative line to scattered continuum flux is independent of the covering fraction .",
    "this is also the case for large optical depth and @xmath35 , since the line and adjacent continuum photons undergo similar amount of absorption and much of the observed flux is due to leakage through `` holes '' in the cloud configuration .",
    "however , for large optical depth and covering fraction approaching unity , much of the line and continuum radiation gets absorbed on the way out .",
    "minor differences in the optical depth structure can result in large changes in equivalent width .",
    "the same is true for situations where the 4@xmath36 covering fraction is much less than unity but the emitted photons pass , on the way out , through gas with substantial optical depth .",
    "such situations must be treated with care and are not considered here .",
    "needless to say , the absolute line flux is very sensitive to the value of  and obtains its maximum value at @xmath37 ( netzer 1996 ) .",
    "the sed of the scattered continuum is another indicator of the ionization state and column density of the gas .",
    "this has been discussed in numerous papers since the first work of lightman and white ( 1988 ) and many examples are shown in netzer ( 1993 ) , netzer , turner and george ( 1994 ) , zycki and czerny ( 1994 ) , zycki  ( 1994 ) and ghisellini , haardt and matt ( 1994 ) .",
    "the 0.510 kev continuum of several scattering  dominated agn ( see  3 ) are considerably flatter than typical , type - i agn continua .",
    "we assign this to the unique chracteristic of scattered seds .",
    "to illustrate this point , and to enable a meaningful comparison with the emission line spectrum (  4 ) , we show , in fig .",
    "5 , two calculations of scattered spectra , using our canonical l@xmath38 continuum .",
    "one has a column density of 10@xmath39  and very low ionization ( ux=10@xmath40 ) and the other a column of 10@xmath41  and a much higher ionization ( ux=10 ) .",
    "the two have the same covering factor and are combined in such a way that the relative intensity of the neutral and highly ionized",
    "lines are similar to what is observed in three of the sources under discussion (  3 ) . as evident from the diagram , large - column , low - ionization gas results in",
    "a rising sed while the slope of the highly ionized gas resembles the incident continuum .",
    "the combination of the two in the right proportions can produce very flat continua , as observed in several scattering  dominated agn .",
    "calculations such as the ones shown here can be used to compare the observed continuum shape with the relative emission line strength . in particular , the analysis of the fe  blend is most useful since , for a typical type - i agn sed , the transition to he - like and h - like iron occurs at ux@xmath42 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the relative strengths of such lines must therefore tell us the relative proportion of the various scattered continuum components . finally , the observed continuum luminosity is related to the intrinsic sed through the reprocessing factor .",
    "as shown by turner  ( 1997b ) , and explained in detail below , this parameter can be inferred from a comparison of the x - ray luminosity with luminosity indicators at other wavelengths .",
    "we have chosen to analyze six narrow line seyfert galaxies with the most prominent ew(fe ) available in the  archives ( as of june 1997 ) : mrk  3 , ngc  6240 , ngc  1068 , circinus a , mrk  348 and ngc  4388 .",
    "these sources are thus likely to be scattering  dominated agn .",
    "three of the sources ( mrk  3 , ngc  6240 , ngc  1068 ) are from the turner  ( 1997a ) sample , and the results from circinus a have been previously presented by matt  ( 1996 ) .",
    "ngc  1068 has also recently been discussed by netzer and turner ( 1997 ) and we use the line measurement given in that paper . for the others",
    ", we have remeasured all prominent x - ray lines , by criteria explained below , and some of our results are therefore different from those listed in the original references .",
    "other suspected objects of this type ( turner  1997b ) have spectra with much lower s / n and are not suitable for this kind of detailed analysis .",
    "the sources presented here were systematically analyzed using the same method as described in turner  ( 1997a ) .",
    "we do not use data below 0.6 kev in the spectral fitting because of some uncertainty in the  xrt / sis calibration , rendering those data points artificially low .",
    "data from both pairs of sis and gis instruments were analyzed simultaneously , but with the normalization of each dataset allowed to vary relative to the others ( to allow for small uncertainties in the relative flux calibrations of the detectors and the different extraction cells employed ) .",
    "all fluxes , luminosities and normalizations are tabulated for sis0 ( with no correction for the point - spread function , or counts lost off the edge of the chip , both are small effects in these cases ) .",
    "we utilized the gain - corrected pulse - invariant ( pi ) channels for all instrument datasets , and the spectra were binned for the spectral analysis such that each channel contained at least 20 counts allowing @xmath43 minimization techniques .",
    "response matrices released on 1994 nov 9 and 1995 march 6 were used for the sis and gis data respectively , and the spectral analysis performed using ` xspec ` ( v10.0 ) .",
    "we employ simple models to try to achieve an acceptable parameterization of the x - ray continuum shape for each dataset .",
    "the purpose is to allow accurate line measurement and we attach no physical significance to the assume continuum components . to do this we first fit the 0.610 kev data excluding the 57 kev band which is dominated by iron k - shell line photons .",
    "we considered a number of continuum models in turn , finding that a double power - law model provided a satisfactory parameterization of each source .",
    "the absorption of the soft x - ray power - law column was constrained to be greater than or equal to the galactic line - of - sight column ( hereafter denoted @xmath44 ) , while the absorption of the hard power - law was independent of this , and unconstrained .",
    "6 shows the sis data and fitted models to the six datasets .",
    "many x - ray emission lines are evident in these datasets .",
    "the 57  kev data were returned to the fit , and gaussian model components were added to the model until we had tested for the presence of all expected lines .",
    "line widths were constrained to be narrow ( @xmath45 ev ) , and we took the approach of adding numerous narrow components to the model , even when too closely spaced to be resolved by  with the intent that we model all the line flux in the data .",
    "however , we tabulate only the resolvable quantities , i.e. we note the sum of fex  xxiv , fexxv ",
    "xxvi+ fe , sixii - xiii and sxiv  xv . the  line is currently problematic for , as it is at an energy close to where most of the calibration ` adjustments ' have been made . bearing this in mind ,",
    "the strength of this line is currently subject to additional unquantifiable uncertainty , in excess of the statistical error tabulated .",
    "as this analysis also revealed evidence for some broad unmodeled residuals in the fe  regime , we allowed a broad fe  component , which may physically represent either the compton scattered wing or , more likely ( turner  1998 ) , the asymmetric component from the putative accretion disk . furthermore , we assumed that scattering  dominated agn have an intrinsic broad fe  line component of the same strength and shape as that observed in seyfert 1 galaxies ( nandra  1997 , turner  1998 ) .",
    "this line is scattered , like the 6.4 kev continuum , by the surrounding gas and ought to be included in the fit .",
    "this component was constrained to be @xmath46  ev , relative to the hard x - ray continuum , to keep it within the range of strengths observed for seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "its inclusion generally improved the fit significantly , thus the list in table  1 takes the broad component into account , even though it is not tabulated .",
    "our continuum fitting procedure includes two power - law components , specified by the photon slope @xmath18 , and one or two absorbers .",
    "the first absorber is the deduced galactic column .",
    "the second is required for ngc  6240 and mkn  348 , where we detect the direct component at high energies .",
    "as already mentioned , the only purpose is to get a reasonable fit to allow accurate line measurements and reliable estimates of the 210 kev luminosities ( attenuation was taken into account when estimating the intrinsic luminosities ) .",
    "the parameters are listed in table 2 and the ones required for ngc  1068 are given in netzer and turner ( 1997 ) ( for this source @xmath47 ) .",
    "the following analysis is based on the line fluxes listed in table 1 as well as on the analysis of the  spectrum of ngc  1068 ( netzer and turner , 1997 , table 1 ) .",
    "obviously , the number of objects , and the number of measurable lines per object , are very small and the information content regarding the group properties is rather limited .    the most severe complication in analyzing the  spectra is the likely contamination of the nuclear spectrum by extended , non - nuclear emission",
    ". this may be the result of hot gas in star forming regions , supernova remnants , or any other gas at t@xmath48  k. the limited  spatial resolution ( with a half - power diameter @xmath49  arcmin ) , combined with the relative weakness of the scattered x - ray continuum , makes it almost impossible to separate the photoionized gas and hot plasma contributions .",
    "indeed , some sources ( e.g. ngc  1068 ) show clear indication of extended x - ray emission which is most likely due to starburst activity",
    ". this issue will not be resolved before _",
    "axaf _ observations ( with a half - power diameter @xmath341  arcsec ) .",
    "below we comment on the information obtained from the study of the fe   complex and address the potential use of diagnostic diagrams in the analysis of the spectrum of scattering  dominated agn .      except for ngc  1068",
    ", all our measurements of the 67 kev complex are somewhat ambiguous since we can not reliably resolve the highly ionized ( 6.7 and 6.96 kev ) fe  lines from the neutral  ( @xmath50 kev ) line .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the high ionization lines pertains to the _ combined intensity _ of the h - like and he - like iron lines , which was obtained by subtracting the expected  flux ( 10% the flux of the 6.4 kev  line ) from the total .",
    "this makes the combined fexxv - xxvi line intensity in ngc  3488 consistent with zero because of the uncertainty on the  flux ( see table 1 ) and the ones in mkn  348 consistent with zero because of the large intrinsic error . the uncertainty in the relative strength of the 6.4 and 6.9 kev component is also affected by the uncertainty in the assumed , scattered broad 6.4 kev line .",
    "the galaxies with measurable soft x - ray lines represent two different groups . in one object ( ngc  1068 ) , the highly ionized iron lines are comparable in strength to the 6.4 kev line . in three others ( circinus , mkn  3 and ngc  4388 ) the combined intensity of the he - like and h - like iron lines is only about 10 - 15% the intensity of the low ionization component .",
    "mkn  348 is possibly an intermediate case but the observational uncertainties are too large to tell .",
    "the intensity of the high ionization iron lines in ngc  6240 is unknown , because of their proximity to the strong 7.1 kev absorption feature due to @xmath51  of neutral absorber .",
    "however , a comparison of the 6.4 kev intensity with the soft x - ray lines suggests that this source belongs to the same group as mkn  3 and circinus .",
    "as for the lines of silicon , magnesium and sulphur , there are only three sources where reliable line ratios can be obtained and they all look quite similar ( see below ) .    regarding the 6.4 kev iron line , a comparison of the measured line intensities with the calculations shown in figs . 2 and 3 ,",
    "indicate that in all sources where this line is much stronger than the 6.77.0 kev complex , the line can not originate in the same component producing the strong magnesium , silicon and sulphur lines .",
    "we therefore suggest that in those sources , much of the 6.4 kev line emissivity is due to reprocessing in a large column of low - ionization gas . as for ngc  1068 ,",
    "the 6.4 kev line in this source may be due to warm ( t@xmath52  k ) photoionized gas ( marshall  1993 ; netzer & turner 1997 ) .",
    "this idea is in conflict with the iwasawa  ( 1997 ) model ( see below ) .",
    "we conclude that in four ( perhaps five ) of the six sources , the reprocessing efficiency ( ) of the neutral component is much greater ( a factor of 510 ) than that of the ionized component .",
    "given the level of ionization of the gas producing the 6.4 kev iron line , and the shape of the ionizing continuum , we can estimate the iron abundance from the observed ew(fe ) in two interesting limits .",
    "the first corresponds to compton ",
    "thin gas and has been discussed by krolik and kallman ( 1987 ) , matt  ( 1996 ) and others . in this case , assuming negligible resonance line absorption and complete isotropy of the scattered continuum radiation ( as appropriate for a case where the scattering medium is viewed at all possible angles ) , @xmath53       [ \\frac{f_y}{0.3 } ]      [ \\frac { n_{fe}/n_h } { 4 \\times 10^{-5 } } ] \\,\\ , kev } \\,\\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where f@xmath54 is the fluorescence yield ( of the order of 0.3 for low ionization iron ) . in deriving this expression",
    "we have adopted the small column density limit which allows us to neglect the absorption of the emitted  photons on the way out .",
    "a much slower ( logarithmic ) dependence on @xmath1 is expected at very large columns .",
    "the second case corresponds to compton ",
    "thick gas , such as the walls of the hypothetical nuclear torus .",
    "this case has recently been calculated by matt  ( 1996 , 1997 ) for a range of metallicities and viewing angles . for a @xmath55 continuum , larger than solar @xmath1 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the angle between the line of sight and the axis of the torus , matt   estimate ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath58 ) \\,\\ , kev .}\\ ] ] the range of observed angles can change this value by up to a a factor of 1.5 .",
    "thus , for a typical @xmath55 continuum , the compton ",
    "thin and compton ",
    "thick assumptions result in a factor 2 difference in the estimated iron abundance .",
    "the two cases also predict very different 6 - 10 kev continuum shape since the compton - thick gas produces a much stronger 7.1 kev absorption edge .",
    "finally , in compton - thick gas , some 10% of the 6.4 kev line intensity is in a broad red wing .",
    "below we discuss the iron abundance under the two different scenarios .",
    "while the emphasis is on line intensities , we note that our continuum fits do not require the presence of a 7.1 kev absorption in any source except ngc  6240 .",
    "the following examples consider two gas components , one represents `` cold '' ( small ux ) gas and the other `` hot '' ( large ux ) gas .",
    "each scatters the central radiation and produces a scattered continuum .",
    "we refer to these as the `` two continuum components '' .",
    "we first assume both components to be compton - thin . in estimating the iron abundance from the observed ew",
    ", we note that the two continuum components are contributing at 6.4 kev and @xmath18 is not directly measurable since scattering affects the observed continuum shape (  2.2 ) .",
    "we use the numerical calculations ( fig .",
    "2 ) and assumed that the iron composition is identical in all components .",
    "we also note that resonance absorption is negligible , because iron is in a very low ionization state in the cold component and the column density is large in the hot component . given these assumptions",
    ", we expect each component ( hot or cold ) to have a similar ew(fe ) _ relative to its own continuum_. thus , in those sources where the 6.76.96 kev iron lines are much weaker than the neutral 6.4 kev lines , most of the 6.4 kev continuum is due to reflection by the neutral component . given the assumed continuum shape , this implies an iron over abundance by a factor 23 for circinus and a factor of 11.5 for mkn  3 . for ngc  6240 and ngc  4388",
    ", we estimate the ew relative to the scattered component by using our best fit model of these source(fig .",
    "6 ) . according to the model , about half the observed 6.4 kev continuum is due to transmission and the other half due to scattering .",
    "we can thus estimate ew(6.4 kev ) relative to the scattered component and deduce n@xmath59/@xmath60solar .",
    "mkn  348 is so different in this respect that we can not reliably estimate ew(fe ) relative to the scattered continuum .",
    "the iron abundance in ngc  1068 , assuming a compton - thin gas , has been discussed by marshall  ( 1993 ) and netzer & turner ( 1997 ) , and found to be about three times solar .",
    "thus , under the compton - thin assumption , we have indications of iron overabundance in 5 sources .    regarding the compton - thick case , the iron abundance inferred from the observed ew (  6.4 kev ) line is about half the value deduced above , i.e. consistent with solar for all sources .",
    "as we show below , the analysis of the highly ionized gas enables an independent check on the iron composition because the medium producing such lines is unlikely to be compton - thick .",
    "diagnostic diagrams , involving various line ratios , have been used to separate seyfert galaxies from galactic hii regions , and to search for the spectroscopic signature of liners ( e.g. baldwin , phillips & terlavich , 1981 ) .",
    "below we attempt to use the same method in the x - ray domain , in search for the unique signature of scattering  dominated agn .",
    "there are two major differences between our study and the investigation of the optical spectrum of liners and hii regions .",
    "first , the number of available x - ray lines is very small and we can only measure , reliably , three line ratios and construct two such diagrams .",
    "second , given the gas is photoionized , the x - ray line spectrum is dominated by recombination and not a single , purely collisionally excited line is strong enough to be used .",
    "collisionally excited x - ray lines dominate the spectrum of hot plasmas with ratios vastly different from that expected in photoionized gas .",
    "thus , there is no overlap in properties and line ratio diagrams can either be used for photoionized gas or for hot plasmas . in contrast , lower excitation photoionized nebulae contain a mixture of recombination and collisionally excited lines that provide very useful diagnostics",
    ". thus ratios like /  have been used to derive the level of ionization of the gas and line ratios involving highly excited o@xmath61 transitions have been used to investigate the role of shock excited gas in the spectrum of liners and seyfert galaxies ( e.g. ferland and netzer 1983 ) .",
    "this kind of analysis is not yet possible in the x - ray regime .",
    "7 shows a diagnostic diagram composed of the best observed line ratios in our sample , i()/i (  + ) versus i()/i ( ) .",
    "the first ratio is a good indicator of regions of large ionization parameters , with electron temperature of the order of 10@xmath62 k , and the second measures the conditions in lower ionization gas .",
    "obviously , the excitation and ionization of  and  is rather similar and future analysis , based on oxygen and neon lines , will be of greater use .",
    "measurements of the two ratios are available for circinus and ngc  1068 and an upper limit can be obtained for mrk  3 ( see  2 ) . the diagram shows the location of the three objects along with four theoretical curves , this time assuming the l@xmath63 continuum .",
    "similar results , with appropriate scaling of ux , are obtained for the l@xmath64 continuum used in most other calculation .",
    "the curves are series of increasing ux for various column density and gas composition .",
    "the solid lines are standard composition models for three column densities , = 10@xmath32  , 10@xmath39  and 10@xmath65  .",
    "the dotted line is for = 10@xmath39  but with @xmath66/  three times larger .      1 .",
    "the observed line ratios can not be simultaneously obtained in a single temperature collisionally ionized gas . under such conditions ,",
    "the temperature required to ionize fexxv and fexxvi is inconsistent with the observed strength of the silicon and magnesium lines .",
    "if all lines are produced in a single component , this gas must be photoionized .",
    "indeed ,  spectra of starburst galaxies ( e.g. ptak , 1997 ) generally show strong silicon and sulphur lines but little or no emission from neutral fe . 2 .",
    "the inferred ionization parameter , @xmath67 , is 310 times larger than the ionization parameter of the highly ionized ( warm absorber ) gas in seyfert 1 galaxies ( george , 1998 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding of turner  ( 1997a ) .",
    "we have examined the properties of this gas and found a mean electron temperature of about 10@xmath62 k and no noticeable soft absorption features .",
    "such gas , on the line of sight to a typical agn continuum , with a column density not exceeding 10@xmath39  ( the column density of the great majority of warm absorbers in seyfert 1 galaxies , see george  1998 ) would escape detection by  type instruments .",
    "3 .   the diagnostic diagram can not , by itself , be used to infer the fe / si abundance ratio since large column densities mimic the appearance of a small - column with large fe / si . as argued in  4.1 ,",
    "the analysis of the 6.4 kev lines suggest large @xmath66/  in all sources if the emitting medium is compton - thin .",
    "if the high ionization components have similar compositions , then according to the diagram , they must have relatively small column densities , perhaps similar to the lowest column shown in fig .",
    "the weakness of  and  lines is somewhat surprising .",
    "the lines are predicted to be similar in strength to the lower ionization magnesium and silicon lines ( figs . 2 and 3 ) yet we could only obtain upper limits .",
    "the difficulty of detecting the  line may partly be explained by the notorious detector / mirror features in  around 2 kev .",
    "so far we have focused on relative line intensities and line - to - continuum flux ratios .",
    "these are useful in determining the ionization and composition but do not reveal the reprocessing efficiency , , since ew(fe 6.4 kev ) is almost independent of the column density ( fig .",
    "1 ) .  can not be obtained by comparing the absolute line flux with the intrinsic luminosity since the latter is not known .",
    "however , there are several other luminosity indicators at longer wavelength , including the infrared flux and the  luminosity ( e.g. mulchaey , 1994 , see extensive discussion in turner , 1997b,1998 ) , that can be used . here",
    "we chose to use the reddening - corrected narrow  line as our luminosity indicator .",
    "this is similar to the l ( ) method used in turner  but enables a more direct comparison with the intrinsic ultraviolet luminosity .",
    "measurements of the narrow  flux for the six sources , as well as for most known type ii agn , are readily available ( mulchaey , 1994 ; polletta , 1996 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the above references contain also the measured /  line ratio which we use to correct for reddening and to obtain the intrinsic  flux . in the following",
    "we assume an intrinsic i()/i()=3.0 and a simple galactic type reddening with a@xmath68/e@xmath69=3.1 .",
    "reddening corrected  fluxes obtained this way are listed in table 1 .",
    "a word of caution is in order . applying a simple , screen - type reddening correction to the spectrum of circinus and ngc",
    "6240 is problematic since the observed balmer decrement in both galaxies is very large ( e.g. fosbury and wall 1979 for the case of ngc  6240 ) .",
    "in addition , much of the  flux in ngc  6240 is likely due to luminous star  forming regions in this galaxy . in both cases , and",
    "probably in many other narrow  line galaxies showing large balmer decrements , the geometry is rather complex with several clouds along each line  of  sight .",
    "we may be looking into dusty environments for which a simple correction factor is inappropriate .",
    "this can invalidate the reddening - corrected  fluxes used here .",
    "the theoretical i(fe ) /i ( ) is easily obtained from the spectral energy distribution , the column density and the iron abundance . for low ionization ,",
    "small balmer optical depth gas , the number of  photons is a known fraction ( about 0.12 for case b recombination ) of the lyman continuum photon flux and the number of fe  photons is a known fraction of the ionizing e@xmath31 kev flux .",
    "the case of interest for this study is gas with very large lyman optical depth yet relatively small hard x - ray optical depth . defining q@xmath70 as the photon flux above 7.1 kev , and q@xmath71 as the lyman continuum photon flux",
    ", we get for this case @xmath72      [ 1-\\exp(-\\tau_{\\rm 7.1 kev } ) ] \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath73        \\frac { ( { \\rm n_{fe}/n_h ) } } { 4 \\times 10^{-5 } } \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] is the 7.1 kev optical depth due to iron ( assumed to be much smaller than unity ) , and @xmath74 is the absorption optical depth due to all metals , at 6.4 kev ( of the same order as @xmath75 for solar @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus at small @xmath75 , the line ratio increases with the iron abundance .",
    "major complications arise due to absorption of the e@xmath31 kev photons by elements other than iron and by the non - negligible opacity at 6.4 kev , resulting in the destruction of emitted  photons .",
    "this makes the fe  emissivity sensitive to the covering fraction since the  photons emitted by one cloud can be absorbed by another cloud . having in mind the nlr conditions , we assume in the following = 0.1 .    fig .",
    "8 shows a series of calculated i(fe ) /i ( ) for n@xmath76 continuum , solar metallicity , = 10@xmath27  applicable to the nlr , and various . to enable a comparison with the expressions given above",
    ", we note that for those models with = 1.3 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the diagram shows that for  @xmath79 and @xmath80 ,   is already emitted at maximum efficiency while the fe  flux is proportional to the column density . for @xmath81 ,",
    "both lines are emitted at maximum efficiency and their ratio reflects the spectral energy distribution , @xmath1 and the destruction of the fe  photons .    inspection of fig .  8 and table 1 suggests that in four sources , ngc  1068 , ngc  6240 mrk  3 and mkn  348 , the i(ka)/i ( ) line ratio is below 0.2 , which is consistent with solar @xmath1 for @xmath82  for = 1.1 . assuming an iron overabundance by 23 reduces the required column to below 10@xmath39  for the same .",
    "furthermore , in three of the four cases the required column can be substantially smaller than the above mentioned upper limit .",
    "the column density is smaller if the uv bump is weaker than assumed and larger if  is larger than assumed .",
    "thus in about half the sources the 6.4 kev iron line could originate in the nlr if the clouds in that region have column densities exceeding about 10@xmath83 .",
    "circinus and ngc  4388 are different since i(fe ) /i",
    "( ) in those sources is an order of magnitude larger than in the other three . as shown in the diagram , this is unlikely to be due to a much larger column density .",
    "either the x - ray source is very bright compared with the uv source ( very small ) or else there is an additional , large covering fraction ,  producing component which is neutral , very thick and inefficient  emitter .",
    "current nlr models ( see ferguson  1997 and references therein ) do not make definite predictions regarding the size of the nlr clouds , since most observed narrow lines originate in the highly ionized , hii part of the clouds .",
    "an obvious complication is if the nlr gas is dusty ( see netzer and laor 1993 and references therein ) . for example , it is conceivable that the nlr clouds are the illuminated faces of dusty molecular clouds of significant column density .",
    "this would result in a reduced  emissivity but the fe  line will hardly be affected .",
    "as already explained , the reddening correction for a dusty hii region can differ substantially from the correction procedure applied here .",
    "we have examined the much larger sample in turner  ( 1997a ) to estimate the intrinsic i(fe ) /i ( ) ratio in type ii agn . out of 17 sources with reliable fe  and  measurements ( including the ones in this paper ) , 7 show reddening corrected i(fe ) /i()@xmath84 which we consider consistent with origin in the nlr of these galaxies .",
    "the remaining sources show a larger ratio that requires  in excess of what is expected from the nlr gas .",
    "the neutral fe  line in those is likely due to absorption by a larger column density , very neutral material that is either the walls of the central torus or large molecular clouds in the nucleus .    given the likely origin of the 6.4 kev line , we can now comment on the nature and location of the gas producing the high ionization iron lines . assuming the same @xmath1 in both components",
    ", we can derive ( hot)/(cold ) .",
    "this is found to be about 1 for ngc  1068 and about 0.1 for mkn  3 and circinus .",
    "the uncertainty is about a factor 2 since , as explained , the scattering efficiency differs by about this factor when comparing compton - thin and compton - thick gas .",
    "we further consider possible combinations of covering factor and note that for compton - thin gas , @xmath85@xmath86 .",
    "this , combined with ( cold)/(hot ) ( about 10@xmath40 with a large uncertainty , see fig . 1 and the parameters used earlier for the nlr gas ) , enables us to estimate several likely combinations of these quantities .",
    "an interesting possibility involving the nlr idea , is that ( hot)@xmath87(cold ) .",
    "this would imply ( hot)@xmath88(cold ) , i.e. ( hot)@xmath891 . in this case ,",
    "the hot and cold components coexist , spatially , and the large ( hot ) does not allow a torus with a small opening angle .",
    "the typical nlr density is about @xmath90  , thus ( hot)@xmath91 . the physical thickness of the hot gas in this case is of order 10 - 100 pc , i.e. of the same order of the nlr size .",
    "we note , however , that the two components are not in pressure equilibrium since nkt@xmath92(cold)@xmath88nkt@xmath92(hot ) .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath93 in both components and ( cold)@xmath88(hot ) .",
    "this does not allow a co - spatial existance of the two components . finally , the 6.4 kev line may be from the thick torus walls .",
    "the efficiency in this case is very large and suggests that the fraction of this wall visible to us is extremely small .",
    "it also suggests that the hot gas completely fills the opening in the torus .",
