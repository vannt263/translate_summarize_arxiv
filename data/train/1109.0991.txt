    ", bursts have been observed from almost all confirmed axps , convincingly linking these two types of neutron star @xcite .",
    "burst activity has been shown to affect the persistent emission and timing characteristics for almost all axps , while for sgrs such effects are consistently found only following energetic bursts @xcite . during the burst active period , the persistent x - ray emission of magnetars has been found to suddenly increase and then rapidly decrease according to an exponential decay that asymptotically approaches the pre - burst active level @xcite .",
    "the spectral and temporal properties of the emission also change during the outburst .",
    "for example , the x - ray flux of 1e@xmath8 increased by at least a factor @xmath9 during the same time interval when more than 80 sgr - like bursts were emitted @xcite , and decayed steadily during the next three years to almost the preburst level @xcite .",

    "this event was analyzed earlier by @xcite , who fit the spectrum with three gaussian functions .",

    "have also reached the same conclusion .    during the first 200 days of the light curve shown in figure [ persisflux ] , the xrt flux measurements are compatible ( within @xmath45 ) with the _ chandra _ historical flux ( figure [ persisflux ] , dotted line ) value reported by @xcite . after day 800 three of the four xrt measurements deviate between @xmath46 from this value , indicating a possible increase associated with the source burst activity . however , a power law fit of the entire xrt data set resulted in a positive slope of @xmath47 , indicating an almost constant flux level during the 1400 day interval .",
    "earlier , @xcite reported a marginal persistent flux increase in associated with the sgr - like burst in 2010 .",

    "we found that their spectral and temporal properties are quite similar to those of typical sgr bursts .",
    "the energy released in these bursts ranges between @xmath2 erg , with a total of @xmath51 erg released in the eight bursts of 2011 . note that these energies are on the low side of sgr bursts @xcite .",

    "july , while prolific sgrs ( e.g. , sgr@xmath52 or sgr 1806@xmath5320 ) can emit up to thousands of short bursts when active .",
    "one of our intriguing findings is that this low - level burst activity had very low impact on the source persistent emission level , in contrast to the changes associated with such activity observed in almost all axps in the past .",
    "we note here , however , that a prominent axp , 4u@xmath54 , emitted six x - ray bursts in 2006 and in early 2007 , but also showed no remarkable change in its persistent x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "an sgr persistent emission would typically not have been affected by these burst intensity levels ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "future xrt observations , in the absence of renewed burst activity , will determine whether the source flux will return to its historic quiescent level .",
    "large changes in the persistent emission after intense bursting activity have been observed in other magnetar candidates , and are expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "bursting activity is thought to be associated with the release of magnetic stress , triggered either by crust rupturing @xcite or magnetospheric instabilities @xcite .",
    "the result should be reconfiguration of the field geometry and/or scattering properties of the magnetosphere @xcite , both of which should affect the flux and pulse shape of the persistent emission .",
    "surface heating and enhanced thermal emission are also expected to result from crustal shear or impact of particles due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "the lack of significant flux enhancement in conjunction with bursting in may imply that the fracturing of the neutron star crust ( or the magnetospheric instability ) in was not a large - scale one , and did not thus have any detectable impact on the longer lasting persistent source properties ( including its spin characteristics , see * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that the magnetospheric dissipation of the burst energy is largely directed away from the atmospheric zones that spawn the persistent emission .",
