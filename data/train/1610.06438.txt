    "in 1932 , by direct analogy with the ordinary spin , heisenberg introduced the concept of isospin to describe the symmetry between proton and neutron under strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "then , after the discovery of the substructure of hadrons  @xcite , the isospin was naturally transferred to denote the two lightest flavors of quarks , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "now , the isospin is a widely used concept in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "the systems with nonzero isospin densities span a large range of nuclear medium from the normal nuclei near drop lines to the neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "novel phenomena can happen at high isospin density .",
    "for example , it is well known that pion superfluidity can occur at large isospin chemical potential @xmath3 ( or density )  @xcite and such superfluidity experiences a smooth crossover from the bose - einstein condensation of pions to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer quark - antiquark pairing ( bec - bcs crossover ) with increasing @xmath3 . moreover , as there is no sign problem at finite @xmath3 , these results were also studied and verified by lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) simulations  @xcite .    based on large @xmath0 analysis , mclerran and pisarski argued that , at large baryon chemical potential @xmath4 , a new phase of dense matter can emerge in which the chiral symmetry is restored while the system remains confined at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "they call such a new phase of matter the  quarkyonic matter \" which reflects the coexistence of quarks and baryons : the thermodynamic properties of the system are dominated by quark fermi seas but the elementary fermionic excitations are confined baryons near the fermi surfaces .",
    "interestingly , recent lqcd simulation showed that even at @xmath5 , the notion of quarkyonic matter is serviceable  @xcite . in this case , the lqcd found that the deconfinement never happens at zero temperature when @xmath4 increases ; instead , the system at large @xmath4 is characterized by quarks always residing in fermi seas and diquark condensate near the fermi surface .    as well known , that the phase structure of the two - color qcd ( qc@xmath6d ) at finite baryon chemical potential @xmath4 is very similar with that of real qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "in fact , they are identical in large @xmath0 limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , one can anticipate that the qcd matter at large isospin density is also quarkyonic matter - like but with a fermi sea comprising quark ( antiquark ) isospin charge and elementary excitation near the fermi surface the mixing pions some isospin component of which condenses at low temperature and leads to superfluidity . to be more specific",
    ", we call this phase of matter the  quarksonic matter \" .",
    "its physical picture is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ quarkson ] where the case @xmath7 is considered : near the fermi surface of isospin charge , @xmath8 antiquarks and @xmath2 quarks pair with each other to form pion condensate @xmath9 at low temperature . for large enough @xmath10 , the pressure and @xmath10 related quantities such as isospin density and compressibility can well be described by nearly free fermion gases of @xmath11 antiquarks and @xmath2 quarks ; but the thermally excited quantities such as entropy and heat capacity can be well described by goldstone excitation @xmath12 at low temperature  @xcite . as temperature increases",
    ", the deconfinement phase transition happens at a certain critical temperature @xmath13 above which gluons and then quarks ( antiquarks ) become active thermal excitations .",
    "associated with isospin density , @xmath9 denotes the pion condensate near fermi surface and @xmath12 denotes the goldstone boson related to @xmath14 flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "the red spirals represent gluons.,width=188,height=226 ]    in this work , we will revisit the quarksonic matter and its properties in both large @xmath0 and asymptotically free limits . in large @xmath0 limit , we will map out a phase diagram in the temperature and isospin chemical potential plane along with discussions similar with those of quarkyonic matter in ref .  @xcite . some comments on the real qcd phase diagram",
    "will also be given right after that .",
    "in asymptotically free limit , we will first derive the coefficient @xmath15 ( see below for the definition ) involved in the expression of the pion condensate up to sub - leading order in qcd coupling constant following refs .",
    "@xcite and then perform further numerical calculations by utilizing the effective pure gluodynamics formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the characters of the new quarksonic matter phase .",
    "the real qcd system with @xmath16 is strongly coupled at low energy and thus is very difficult to handle .",
    "but if one treats @xmath0 as a free parameter and lets it go to infinity while keeps @xmath17 fixed ( the t hooft limit )  @xcite , one can greatly simplify the problem and obtain important insights to the original problem .",
    "so we will first consider the phase diagram in @xmath18 plane at large @xmath0 limit which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phase diagram ] .",
    "two important points should be emphasized afore : first , as chiral symmetry restoration is usually consistent with deconfinement transition , only bcs state is expected to exist above deconfinement temperature @xmath13 .",
    "second , due to volume independence in large-@xmath0 qcd - like gauge theories  @xcite , all the transition lines below @xmath13 are temperature independent as had been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at large @xmath0 limit , the quark loops ( @xmath19 )",
    "are strongly suppressed compared to gluon loops ( @xmath20 )  @xcite which is responsible for the confining dynamics . as a result ,",
    "the deconfinement temperature is independent of @xmath10 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the qcd confinement scale which is assumed to be @xmath23 . at zero temperature",
    ", the pion superfluidity happens when @xmath10 is larger than the pion mass in vacuum @xmath24",
    "@xcite which is @xmath23 ; thus the critical isospin chemical potential is @xmath25 . right above @xmath26 , the system is a dilute bose gas of pions and the superfluidity is due to the bec of pions . in this region ,",
    "the pressure is of order @xmath23 as in hadronic phase , because the isospin density ( @xmath19 ) almost all contributes to the bec which does nt affect the thermodynamic properties . with increasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the system begins to transform from bec of pions to bcs superfluidity of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "there is no symmetry breaking occurs during such a bec - bcs crossover and thus no critical @xmath10 to set this crossover .",
    "we mark the start point of the bec - bcs crossover as the @xmath10 at which the in - medium quark mass drops to zero @xmath27 . such determined @xmath10 is also independent of @xmath0 .",
    "eventually , when @xmath10 is large enough , the pressure is dominated by quark ( antiquark ) fermi seas and is of order @xmath19 .",
    ", then we enter the quarksonic matter phase .",
    "because the interaction among pions are suppressed at large @xmath0 limit , we expect the threshold @xmath10 for this phase is also @xmath23 .",
    "the pion condensate or the quark - antiquark condensate in general increases with @xmath10 and so does the critical temperature @xmath28 for pion superfluidity .",
    "thus for large enough @xmath10 , @xmath28 will eventually be larger than @xmath13 leaving the region in between being occupied by deconfined pion superfluid . above @xmath28 ,",
    "the system is a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) with pressure @xmath20 .",
    "phase diagram in large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines correspond to the first - order transition , second - order transition , and crossover , respectively.,width=302 ]    for real qcd , the topological structure of the @xmath18 phase diagram is expected to be similar with the one in large @xmath0 limit . however , some detailed structures can be altered . combining the results from perturbative discussions  @xcite , lqcd calculations  @xcite , and also model studies  @xcite , one expects @xmath13 to decrease with increasing @xmath10 in the whole region ( as the confinement scale is decreasing at large @xmath10 ) which indicates shrink of the quarksonic matter region .",
    "the melting temperature of the pion superfluidity keeps increasing with @xmath10 and the transition is still second order , but the deconfinement transition was argued to change from crossover to first order with a new critical end point in the bec - bcs crossover region  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , we can perform perturbative calculation when @xmath10 is very large . previously , similar calculations have already been done in large @xmath4 limit  @xcite and the expressions of the diquark condensate and the critical temperature of color superconductivity were obtained up to sub - leading order in the perturbative coupling expansion  @xcite .",
    "the expression of the pion condensate ( more precisely , the excitation gap of the quasiparticles ) was argued to be in the form @xmath29 with @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the actual value of @xmath15 is still unknown so far ; so we d like to calculate @xmath15 first within the perturbative framework .    _ the coefficient @xmath15 . _ to obtain the correct value of @xmath15 , we need to self - consistently take the self - energy of quarks into account  @xcite .",
