    "can one perform universal quantum computing in such a setting ?",
    "perhaps surprisingly , this is indeed the case : the _ one - way model _ of refs .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that local measurements on the _ cluster state _",
    " a certain multi - particle entangled state on an array of qubits @xcite  do possess this computational power .",
    "the insight gives rise to an appealing view of quantum computation : one can in principle abandon the need for any unitary control , once the initial state has been prepared .",
    "the local measurements  a feature that any computing scheme would eventually embody  then take the role of preparation of the input , the computation proper , and the read - out .",
    "this is of course a very desirable feature : quantum computation then only amounts to ( i ) preparing a universal resource state and ( ii ) performing local projective measurements [ 26 ] .",
    "but what about other entangled quantum states , different from cluster or graph states @xcite ?",
    "can they form a resource for universal computation ?",
    "is it possible to tailor resource states to specific physical systems ?",
    "for some experimental implementations ",
    "e.g. ,  cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , atoms in cavities @xcite , optical systems [ 11 - 13 ] , ions in traps @xcite , or many - body ground states  it may well be that preparation of cluster states is unfeasible , costly , or that they are particularly fragile to finite temperature or decoherence effects .",
    "also , from a fundamental point of view , it is clearly interesting to investigate the computational power of many - body states  either for the purpose of building measurement - based quantum computers or else for deciding which states could possibly be classically simulated @xcite . interestingly , very little progress has been made over the last years when it comes to going beyond the cluster state as a resource for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) . to our knowledge , no single computational model distinct from the one - way computer has been developed which would be based on local measurements on an algorithm - independent qubit resource state .",
    "the apparent lack of new schemes for mbqc is all the more surprising , given the great advances that have been made toward an understanding of the structure of cluster state - based computing itself .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the computational model of the one - way computer and teleportation - based approaches to quantum computing @xcite are essentially equivalent @xcite .",
    "a particularly elegant way of realizing this equivalence was discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite : they pointed out that the maximally entangled states used for the teleportation need not be physical .",
    "instead , the role can be taken on by virtual entangled pairs used in a `` valence bond '' @xcite description of the cluster state .",

    "the problem of finding novel schemes for measurement - based computation can be approached from two different points of view .",
    "firstly , one may concentrate on the _ quantum states _ which provide the computational power of measurement - based computing schemes and ask    1 .   _",
    "what are the properties that render a state a universal resource for a measurement - based computing scheme for a discussion , in particular in relation to ref .  @xcite . ] ? _    secondly , putting the emphasize on _ methods _ , the central question becomes    1 .",
    "_ how can we systematically construct new schemes for measurement - based quantum computation ?",
    "is there a framework which is flexible enough to allow for the construction of a variety of different models ? _    both of these intertwined questions will be addressed in this work .",
    "as our main result , we present a plethora of new universal resource states and computational schemes for mbqc .",
    "the examples have been chosen to demonstrate the flexibility one has when constructing models for measurement - based computation .",
    "indeed , it turns out that many properties one might naturally conjecture to be necessary for a state to be a universal resource can in fact be relaxed .",
    "needless to say , the weaker the requirements are for a many - body state to form a resource for quantum computing , the more feasible physical implementations of mbqc become .",
    "below , we enumerate some specific results concerning the properties of resource states .",
    "the list pertains to question 1 given in the introduction .",
    "* in the cluster state , every particle is maximally entangled with the rest of the lattice . also , the localizable entanglement @xcite is maximal ( i.e.  one can deterministically prepare an maximally entangled state between any two sites , by performing local measurements on the remainder ) . while both properties are essential for the original one - way computer , they turn out not to be necessary for computationally universal resource states . to the contrary",
    ", we construct _ universal states which are locally arbitrarily pure_. * for previously known schemes for mbqc , it was essential that far - apart regions of the state were uncorrelated .",
    "this feature allowed one to logically break down a measurement - based calculation into small parts corresponding to individual quantum gates .",
    "our framework does not depend on this restriction and resources with _ non - vanishing correlations _ between any two subsystems are shown to exist .",
    "this property is common e.g. ,  in many - body ground - states .",
    "* cluster states can be prepared step - wise by means of a bi - partite _ entangling gate _ ( controlled - phase gate ) .",
    "this property is important to the original universality proof .",
    "more generally , one might conjecture that resource states must always result from an entangling process making use of mutually commuting entangling gates , also known as a unitary _ quantum cellular automaton _",
    "once more , this requirement turns out not to be necessary . *",
    "the cluster states can be used as _ universal preparators _ : any quantum state can be distilled out of a sufficiently large cluster state by local measurements .",
    "once more , this property is essential to the original one - way computer scheme .",
    "however , computationally universal resource states not exhibiting this properties do exist ( the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for an analysis of resource states which are required to be preparators ; see also the discussion in section [ sec : propertiesdiscussion ] ) .",
    "more strongly , we construct universal resources out of which not even a single two - qubit maximally entangled state can be distilled . *",
    "a genuine _ qu - trit _ resource is presented ( distinct , of course , from a qu - trit version of the cluster state @xcite ) .",
    "measurement - based quantum computing as generalization of the one - way model as being considered in this work .",
    "initially , an entangled resource state is available , different from the cluster state , followed by local projective measurements on all individual constituents in the regular not necessarily cubic lattice . in all figures ,",
    "dark gray circles denote individual physical systems.,width=207 ]    we will further see that there is quite some flexibility concerning the computational model itself ( addressing question  2 mentioned in the introduction ) :    * the new schemes differ from the one - way model in the way the _ inherent randomness _ of quantum measurements is dealt with . *",
    "we generalize the well - known concept of _ by - product operators _ to encompass any finite group .",
    "e.g.  we show the existence of computational models , where the by - product operators are elements of the entire single - qubit clifford group , or the dihedral group .",
    "* we explore schemes where each logical qubit is encoded in _ several neighboring correlation systems _ ( see section [ sec : ctn ] for a definition of the term `` correlation system '' ) .",
    "* one can find ways to construct schemes in which interactions between logical qubits are controlled by `` routing '' the qubits towards an `` interaction zone '' or keeping them away from it . * in many schemes , we adjust the layout of the measurement pattern dynamically , incorporating information about previous measurement outcomes as we go along . in particular , the expected length of a computation is random ( this constitutes no problem , as the probability of exceeding a finite expected length is exponentially small in the excess ) .",
    "what are the properties from which a universal resource state derives its power ? after clarifying the terminology , we will argue that an answer to this question  desirable as it may be  faces formidable obstacles .",
    "quantum computation can come in a variety of different incarnations , as diverse as e.g. ,  the well - known gate - model @xcite , adiabatic quantum computation @xcite or mbqc .",
    "all these models turn out to be equivalent in that they can simulate each other efficiently .    for measurement - based schemes , the `` hardware '' consists of a multi - particle quantum system in an algorithm - independent state and a classical computer .",
    "the input is a gate - model description of a quantum computation . in every step of the computation",
    ", a local measurement is performed on the quantum state and the result is fed into the classical computer .",
    "based on the outcomes of previous steps , the computer calculates which basis to use for the next measurements and , finally , infers the result of the computation from the measurement outcomes @xcite . having this procedure in mind , we call a quantum state a _ universal resource _ for mbqc , if a classical computer assisted by local measurements on this states can efficiently predict the outcome of any quantum computation",
    ".    the reader should be aware that another approach has recently been described in the literature .",
    "the cluster state has actually a stronger property than the one just used for the definition of universality : it is a universal preparator .",
    "this means that one can prepare any given quantum state on a given sub - set of sites of a sufficiently large cluster by means of local measurements .",
    "hence , cluster states could in principle be used for information processing tasks which require a quantum output .",
    "@xcite referred to this scenario as _ cq - universality _ ",
    "i.e.  universality for problems which require a classical input but deliver a quantum output .",
    "this observation is the basis of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a state is called a universal resource if it possesses the strong property of being a universal preparator , or , equivalently , of being cq - universal .    clearly , any efficient universal preparator is also a computationally universal resource for mbqc ( since one can , in particular , prepare the cluster state ) .",
    "but the converse is not true , as our results show . indeed , while it proves possible to come up with necessary criteria for a state to be a universal preparator @xcite , we will argue below that the current limited understanding of quantum computers makes it extremely hard to specify necessary conditions for computational universality .    in order to pinpoint the source of the quantum speedup",
    ", we might try to find schemes where more and more work is done by the classical computer , while the employed quantum states become `` simpler '' ( e.g.,smaller or less entangled ) .",
    "how far can we push this program without losing universality ?",
    "the answer is likely to be intractable .",
    "currently , we are not aware of a proof that quantum computation is indeed more powerful than classical methods .",
    "hence , it can presently not be excluded that no assistance from a quantum state is necessary at all .",
    "[ obs : assumption ] if one is unwilling to _ assume _ that there is a separation between classical and quantum computation ( i.e. , bpp @xmath0 bqp ) , then it is impossible to rule out any state as a universal resource .",
    "it is , however , both common and sensible to assume superiority of quantum computers and we will from now on do so .",
    "observation [ obs : assumption ] still serves a purpose : it teaches us that the only known way to rule out universality is to invoke this assumption ( this avenue was taken , e.g. ,  in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "[ obs : onlyway ] the only currently known method for excluding the possibility that a given quantum state forms a universal resource is to show that any measurement - based scheme utilizing the state can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer .",
    "thus , the situation presents itself as follows : there is a tiny set of quantum states for which it is possible to prove that any local measurement - based scheme can be efficiently simulated .",
    "on the other extreme , there is an even tinier set for which universality is provable . for the vast majority",
    "no assessment can be made .",
    "furthermore , given the fact that rigorously establishing the `` hardness '' of many important problems in computer science turned out to be extremely challenging , it seems unlikely that this situation will change dramatically in the foreseeable future .",
    "we conclude that a search for necessary conditions for universality is likely to remain futile .",
    "the converse question , however , can be pursued : it is possible to show that many properties that one might naively assume to be present in any universal resource are , in fact , unnecessary .",
    "the current section is devoted to an in - depth treatment of a class of states known respectively as valence - bond states , finitely correlated states , matrix product states or projected entangled pairs states , adapted to our purposes of measurement - based quantum computing .",
    "this family turns out to be especially well - suited for a description of a computing scheme .    indeed , any systematic analysis of resources states requires a framework for describing quantum states on extended systems .",
    "we briefly compile a list of desiderata , based on which candidate techniques can be assessed .",
    "* the description should be _ scalable _ , so that a class of states on systems of arbitrary size can be treated efficiently .",
    "* as quantum states which are naturally described in terms of one - dimensional topologies have been shown to be classically simulable @xcite , the framework ought to handle _ two- or higher dimensional topologies _ naturally . *",
    "the basic operation in measurement - based computation are _",
    "local measurements_. it would be desirable to describe the effect of local measurements in a local manner .",
    "ideally , the class of efficiently describable states should be closed under local measurements .",
    "* the class of describable states should include elements which show features that naturally occur in _ ground states _ of quantum many - body systems , such as _ non - maximal local entropy of entanglement _ or _ non - vanishing two - point correlations _ , etc .    the description of states to be introduced below complies with all of these points .",
    "we will introduce the construction in several steps , starting with one - dimensional matrix product states .",
    "the new view on the processing of information is that the matrices appearing in the description of resource states are taken literally , as operators processing quantum information",
    ".      a _ matrix product state _ ( mps ) for a chain of @xmath1 systems of physical dimension @xmath2 ( so @xmath3 for qubits ) is specified by    * an _ auxiliary @xmath4 dimensional vector space _ (",

    "also , it is easy to see that the probability @xmath50 that a measurement - based scheme will leave any system of block @xmath5 in a locally maximally mixed state is bounded from above by @xmath307 let @xmath308 be the initial probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath48 for a @xmath44 measurement on this qubit , @xmath309 . clearly , @xmath310 we consider now a local scheme potentially acting on all qubits except this distinguished one , with branches labeled @xmath311 , aiming at preparing this qubit in a maximally mixed state .",
    "let @xmath312 be the probability of the qubit ending up in a locally maximally mixed state . in case of success , so in case of the preparation of a locally maximally entangled state , we have that @xmath313 , in case of failure @xmath314 . combining these inequalities",
    ", we get @xmath315 we can hence show that there exists a family of universal resource states such that the probability that a local measurement scheme can prepare a maximally entangled qubit pair ( up to l.u .",
    "equivalence ) out of any element of that family is strictly smaller than @xmath279 .",
    "let @xmath316 be the probability that a site of block @xmath5 will end up as a part of a maximally entangled pair .",
    "this means that when we fix the procedure , and label as before all sequences of measurement outcomes with @xmath311 , one does not perform measurements on all constituents .",
    "let @xmath317 denote the index set labeling the cases where somewhere on the lattice a maximally entangled pair appears , so the probability @xmath50 for this to happen is bounded from above by @xmath318 according to the above bound , @xmath319 , giving a strict upper bound of @xmath320 for the overall probability of success .",
    "the family @xmath321 for @xmath322 is clearly universal , involves only a linear overhead as compared to the original cluster state and satisfies the assumptions advertised above .",
    "in this work , we have shown how to construct a plethora of novel models for measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "our methods were taken from many - body theory .",
    "the new models for quantum computation follow the paradigm of locally measuring single sites  and hence abandoning any need for unitary control during the computation .",
    "other than that , however , they can be quite different from the one - way model .",
    "we have found models where the randomness is compensated in a novel manner , the length of the computation can be random , gates are performed by routing flows of quantum information towards one another , and logical information may be encoded in many correlation systems at the same time .",
    "what is more , the resource states can in fact be radically different from the cluster states , in that they may display correlations as typical in ground states , can be weakly entangled . a number of properties of resource states that we found reasonable to assume to be necessary for a state to form a universal resource could be eventually relaxed .",
    "so after all , it seems that much less is needed for measurement - based quantum computation than one could reasonably have anticipated .",
    "this new degree of flexibility may well pave the way towards tailoring computational model towards many - body states that are particularly feasible to prepare , rather than trying to experimentally realize a specific model .",
    "this work has benefited from fruitful discussions with a number of people , including k.  audenaert , i.  bloch , h .- j .",
    "briegel , j.i .",
    "cirac , c.  dawson , w.  dr , d.  leung , a.  miyake , m.  van den nest , f.  verstraete , m.b .",
    "plenio , t.  rudolph , m.m .  wolf , and a.  zeilinger .",
    "it has been supported by the eu ( qap , qovaqial ) , the elite - netzwerk bayern , the epsrc , the qip - irc , microsoft research , and the euryi award scheme .",
    "what is the value of the two - point correlation function @xmath323 ? in this work , we have only introduced the behavior of the correlation system when subject to a local measurement of a rank - one observable . however , in order to evaluate the correlation function , we need `` measure the identity '' on the intermediate systems or , equivalently , trace them out .",
    "without going into the general theory @xcite , we just state that tracing out a system will cause the completely positive map @xmath324\\rho a[i]^\\dagger\\ ] ] to act on the correlation system .    for the cluster state , using the fact that the bases @xmath325 and @xmath326 are unbiased , we can easily show that @xmath327 is the completely depolarizing channel , sending any @xmath300 to @xmath328 .",
    "this causes any correlation function to vanish for @xmath329 .",
    "how does the situation look like for the state vector defined by eq.([eqn : gstate ] ) ?",
    "we compute : @xmath330 so for @xmath331 : @xmath332 where @xmath333 and @xmath334 . in other words : when acting on the computational basis , @xmath335 implements a simple two - state markov process , which remains in the same state with probability @xmath50 and switches its state with probability @xmath336 .",
    "now , @xmath337 equals @xmath338 if an even number of state changes occurred and @xmath157 if that number is odd .",
    "so for the expectation value we find @xmath339      in section [ sec : aklt ] we discussed an aklt - type matrix product state .",
    "it was claimed that the state constitutes the unique ground - state of a spin-1 nearest neighbor frustration free gapped hamiltonian .",
    "it must be noted that in this work , we have not introduced the technical tools needed to cope with boundary effects at the end of the chain .",
    "there are at least three ways to make the above statement rigorous : a ) treat the statement as being valid asymptotically in the limit of large chains , b ) work directly with infinite - volume states @xcite , or c ) look at sufficiently large rings with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "once one chooses one of the options outlined above , the proof of this fact proceeds along the same lines as the one of the original aklt state , as presented in example 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed , using the notions of refs .",
    "@xcite one verifies that @xmath340 a[i_2 ] )       { \\mbox{$| i_1,i_2 \\rangle$}}&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is injective .",
    "further , if @xmath341 , it is checked by direct computation that @xmath342 .",
    "all claims follow as detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in particular ,",
    "let @xmath343 be a positive operator supported on the vector space spanned by : @xmath344 set @xmath345 , where @xmath346 translates its argument @xmath5 sites along the chain .",
    "then @xmath71 is a non - degenerate , gapped , frustration free , nearest neighbor hamiltonian ( called _ parent hamiltonian _ in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whose energy is minimized by the state at hand .",
