( [ eq : expansion ] ) ) in a series of six discrete basis functions ( see subsections  [ subsec : time_dependent_model ] and [ subsec : physmod ] ) . the first three are constructed as a simple product of the ground bulk fermi state in the perpendicular direction and a @xmath156 or @xmath157 orbital parallel to the surface .",
    "the last three are constructed similarly but with the @xmath81 image state in the perpendicular direction .",

    "the analysis of figures  [ fig : res_excitation_probab ] , [ fig : res_current_0 ] and  [ fig : res_current_int ] concludes that , near the gas - solid interface , a realistic model of the electron dynamics in the presence of the laser - matter interaction requires the inclusion of the spatial variation of the laser field even in the long wavelength domain .    the excitation probability ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_excitation_probab ] ) and the current density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_current_0 ] ) are different for the @xmath3 and @xmath2- polarizations of the laser , giving an indication on the so called surface photoelectric effect appearing in the neighborhood , approximately @xmath200  35   , of the interface .",
    "precisely , table [ tab : a_p_operator ] gives the different contributions to the interaction hamiltonian and one sees that , even if the vector potential projections @xmath37 and @xmath42 are equivalent , the @xmath37 scalar product contains the derivative with respect to @xmath37 of the vector potential whereas the @xmath42 scalar product does not contain a similar surface term .",
    "therefore , from the difference between the observables for the @xmath3 and @xmath2- polarizations , in the present excitation between discrete states or an excitation giving rise to an electron emission in the vacuum , one can not estimate precisely the surface photoelectric effect .    the current density @xmath201 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_current_0 ] ) reproduces the spatial oscillations of the electron - solid potential as well as the temporal oscillations of the laser field .",
    "contrary to the excitation probability , this observable is unravel the phase of the time evolution of the laser . the current density @xmath151 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_current_int ] ) is directly related to the laser - matter interaction term in the hamiltonian and , for photoemission , to the surface photoelectric effect . but this term is weak and can not be measured experimentally .",
    "finally , let us discuss the approximations and the limitations of the present model .",
    "first , the separable electron - surface potential contains a contribution in the @xmath9 direction explicitly calculated and a contribution parallel to the surface that is not explicitly calculated . but this separable potential could be replaced by a more realistic tridimensional potential obtained using , for example , a dft calculation .",
    "in addition , the present simulation of the excitation between discrete states can easily be extended to the photoemission and , because our wave function is expanded on a basis set , the number of these basis functions can easily be raised .",
    "secondly , the use of tabulated material constants in our model implies that this model is able to account for the presence of the plasma oscillations in the bulk as one of us has shown for a jellium al(100 ) surface  @xcite .",
    "one can also account for the change in the observables at the surface plasmon frequency because in the present model the dielectric function depends on @xmath9 .",
    "the dependence introduced here is similar to the one used by feibelman  @xcite when he derives the frequency of the surface plasmon .",
    "let us now replace the present work in a more general context .",
    "the consequences of the spatial variation of the vector potential have been highlighted through a numerical calculation of the excitation probability and of the current density .",
    "but other physical observables _",
    "qualitatively _ sensitive to such a spatial variation of the vector potential , have to be identified , calculated and measured .",
    "for example , time resolved tppe experiments , coupled with some interference measurements  @xcite or combination of tppe and photoemission electron microscope ( peem )  @xcite , could be efficient experimental techniques for observables sensitive to the spatial variation of the vector potential .",
    "particularly the last cited technique tppe / peem allows for an imaging of single nano objects of a size of about 50  nm thus diminishing the averaging made over many objects in standard experiments .",
    "combination of a laser with a stm  @xcite in a single simultaneous experiment can be also used for measuring the observables related to these nano objects .",
    "one can easily extend the present model to single photon photoemission but such a model remains oversimplified for the previously cited experimental techniques .",
    "in fact , to model a tppe experiment , one has to take into account , in addition to the direct excitation processes and associated continua of the electron , the electron - electron relaxation at the surface and in the bulk .",
    "modeling such an experiment , implies the combination of the emfed vector potential with a density matrix formulation  @xcite .",
    "our approach calculates some of the ingredients needed for such a density matrix model , as for example the unperturbed states and the interaction matrix elements with a spatially varying vector potential .",
    "other needed ingredients , like the elastic and inelastic parameters of the electron - electron collisions corresponding to the relaxation to the bath , can be taken from the existing literature .",
    "concerning other systems to be studied , different clean metallic surfaces can be selected , but adsorbates  @xcite or nano objects on surfaces  @xcite could also be very sensitive to a spatially varying vector potential .",
    "the calculation of the observables as a function of photon frequency , particularly at the bulk and surface plasmon resonance , is the next goal in our modeling .",
    "generalization to semiconductor surfaces is also of interest .",
    "however , for these surfaces reconstruction takes place and the wave functions parallel to the surface should be functions of the slab layer .    in summary",
    ", the present model clearly shows that the spatial variation of the vector potential , in the vicinity of the gas - solid interface , significantly modifies the electron dynamics near the surface , even in the long wavelength domain . here",
    ", we have proposed a relatively simple approach for the calculation of this spatial variation .",

    "<S> in the long wavelength domain , typically for wavelengths , the laser fields are usually taken as independent of the spatial coordinate . however , at the gas - solid interface the electron density of the material and the incident laser fields vary sharply on a scale of few angstrms . </S>",
    "<S> instead of solving maxwell equations , we present here a theoretical model , called _ electromagnetic fields from electron density _ ( emfed ) , generating a continuous vector potential @xmath0 from phenomenological relations combining the unperturbed electron density of the material system , the material constants and the laws of optics . as an application of this model , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate in a time dependent approach the transition probability and the induced current density between the last bulk state below the fermi energy and the first image state of a cu(001 ) metallic surface . </S>",
    "<S> these observables are significantly modified by the spatial variation of the vector potential at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb gauge condition ( @xmath1 ) , fullfilled everywhere else , breaks down near the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the @xmath2- and @xmath3- polarizations of the laser field partially unravels this effect . </S>"
