    "in thermal equilibrium , amorphous thin film silicon dioxide ( a - sio@xmath0 ) can contain large quantities of highly localized silicon dangling bond states , so called e centers  @xcite .",
    "these defects exhibit positive correlation energies and are therefore paramagnetic , a property that allows us to study these centers with electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy techniques  @xcite .",
    "as e centers limit the performance of a - sio@xmath0 device components ( e.g. the gate dielectric of silicon thin film transistors  @xcite ) , most studies of e center properties have focused primarily on how e center densities can be minimized by a - sio@xmath0 preparation and treatment .",
    "few studies in the past have focused on the dynamic properties of this spin @xmath8 system , but those that have show that e centers exhibit remarkably long longitudinal ( @xmath9 ) spin relaxation times over large temperature ranges  @xcite .",
    "at room temperature @xmath9 times on the order of hundreds of microseconds have been reported  @xcite .",
    "this is long compared to the @xmath9 times of silicon dangling bonds at the a - sio@xmath0 to crystalline silicon ( c - si ) interface  @xcite ( the so called p@xmath10 centers)and it is comparable to other bulk silicon dangling bonds in amorphous silicon  @xcite or microcrystalline silicon  @xcite .",
    "hence , even though e centers are generally viewed as detrimental for technological applications , they could become important for spin applications such as spin memory concepts or as probe spins for spin readout applications  @xcite .",
    "in fact , recently , it was shown that e centers close to the c - si / a - sio@xmath0 interface can be used as probe spins for the phosphorous donor nuclear / electron spin qubit  @xcite , an intensively studied impurity qubit system which is currently among the most coherent known quantum systems in nature  @xcite .",
    "spin pair based qubit readout requires that the distance between the probe and the test spin can be shifted relative to its respective pair partner on atomic or possibly subatomic length scales  @xcite . while experimental demonstrations have been given that this qubit ",
    "probe spin pair readout works extraordinary well when the two states have an appropriate proximity , it has remained elusive so far how to establish and manipulate such distances in a controlled and reproducible manner .",
    "we are currently in the pursuit of achieving such distance control by means of scanning probe microscopy , an idea that requires scanning probes with an a - sio@xmath0 surface and a single e center at its tip .",
    "since e centers develop at random sites within the continuous random network of a - sio@xmath0 , we suggest to fabricate individual probe spins at cantilever tips by growth of an a - sio@xmath0 layer on c - si cantilevers whose e density is large enough such that a sufficiently large probability exists that a single e center is very near the apex of the tip .",
    "the silicon dioxide needed for the spin readout measurements must meet four criteria : ( 1 ) the density of e centers must be high enough such that the probability to find a center at the apex of a cantilever probe tip is of the order of unity .",
    "an estimate for the active tip volume in which a single e center can be utilized as a probe spin in the grown oxide layer can be obtained from the product of the tip surface area of less than 300nm@xmath11 for a 25 nm tip radius and a tunneling depth of less than 2 nm .",
    "thus , the oxide layer requires e densities between 10@xmath12@xmath13 and 10@xmath14@xmath13 . this is higher than the highest previously reported e densities  @xcite which were generated via electric currents through silicon dioxide gate dielectrics , a procedure that is hardly applicable to cantilever surfaces .",
    "( 2 ) the e centers at high densities must exhibit similarly long transverse spin relaxation times ( @xmath9 ) as at low densities .",
    "if the proximity of the e states significantly increases the spin relaxation , applicability for spin readout will be limited  @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the e centers must be stable at room temperature and under ambient light illumination .",
    "they need to be chemically stable .",
    "either limited defect lifetimes or limited spin lifetimes ( relaxation times ) could equally be showstoppers for the applicability of e centers to single spin readout schemes .",
    "( 4 ) the electrons from the e centers should not leak from one center to another .    in the following sections , we report unsuccessful and successful attempts to create sio@xmath0 layers with very high densities of e centers .",
    "the thermal and light exposure stability of the high e densities will be discussed and the relaxation dynamics of e spins in very high density layers will be presented ( for both , @xmath9 and @xmath5 times ) .",
    "the results of these studies will then be discussed with regard to the suitability of this newly developed high e density sio@xmath0 for scanning probe controlled single spin detection and readout .",
    "for the study of various e preparation techniques , we used n - type , phosphorous doped ( [ @xmath16p]@xmath17@xmath13 ) czochralski grown c - si(111 ) wafers .",
    "the use of phosphorous doped material allowed a very accurate determination of the e densities from epr spectra since the well known hyperfine split @xmath16p resonance could be used as an in - sample spin - standard .",
    "the 300 micrometer thick 3 \" wafers were first annealed in oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 1000@xmath18 in order to form an approximately 60 nm thick ( profilometer measured ) thermally grown a - sio@xmath0 layer .",
    "the oxidized samples were then diced into 60 mm x 3 mm size epr compatible rectangles .",
    "the black data points of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] display an epr spectrum of the as prepared thermal oxides .",
    "the two peaks are due to the hyperfine split @xmath16p resonance that , due to the known phosphorous bulk density and therefore areal density ( @xmath19 ) , can be used to calibrate the magnetic field and density scales for the e center measurements .",
    "the black data points show almost no resonant features next to the phosphorous hyperfine peaks which means that e densities in as grown samples are below the detection limit which is @xmath20 for the given measurement conditions .",
    "this corresponds to an average volume density below @xmath21 within the 60 nm thin film .",
    "thus , given that previous reports of e densities in thermally grown sio@xmath0 are all significantly below the @xmath22 limit , we expected no significantly different epr signals from e centers for the as grown oxide layers .    in order to explore how to create e densities @xmath23 ,",
    "the thin a - sio@xmath0 layer was exposed to ( i ) ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation  @xcite ( produced by a ndyag laser with 264 nm wave length ) for six hours , ( ii ) gamma radiation produced by a @xmath24cs sample for 24 hours , producing an overall irradiation dose of about 10 - 12mrad  @xcite , ( iii ) different growth temperatures during the thermal growth , ( iv ) an ar - ion discharge plasma excited by a 300w 13.56mhz rf excitation at 0.5sccm gas flow and a pressure of 10mtorr  @xcite .",
    "we then conducted epr measurements similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] on the samples treated according to ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) . these measurements revealed similar results compared to the as grown sample , represented by the black data in fig .",
    "this again confirmed the previous reports that treatment of a - sio@xmath0 layers following these methods may increase the e center densities but not beyond the @xmath22 range .",
    "p doped c - si(111 ) samples measured at a temperature @xmath25k with a field modulation frequency @xmath26khz , a modulation amplitude of 0.1mt , and a weak microwave power of 4@xmath27w to avoid saturation .",
    "the samples had 60 nm thin layers of thermally grown a - sio@xmath0 .",
    "the black data points represent measurements of the as prepared thermal oxide .",
    "the blue data points show a measurements under identical conditions after the sample was been exposed to an argon ion plasma for 5 minutes.,width=321 ]    in contrast , the application of the ar - ion plasma treatment ( method iv ) caused a significant increase of the e density , as indicated by the blue circled data points in fig .",
    "the plot displays a feature at a magnetic field of approximately 348mt , corresponding to a land - factor of @xmath28 which is attributed to plasma induced e centers .",
    "the average e center volume density in this film derived from the measured areal density per film thickness is @xmath29@xmath13 , determined by using the phosphorus donor spins in the silicon substrate as a reference .",
    "while this observation shows that the plasma exposure of the oxide film is able to generate a large quantity of paramagnetic species at the @xmath30-factor anticipated for e centers , it is not clear whether these states are all e centers ( silicon dangling bonds within the sio@xmath0 bulk ) .",
    "other paramagnetic species such as interface defects between the sio@xmath0 layer and the c - si bulk ( if the etch has not removed the entire oxide ) or the plasma etched c - si surface states ( if the oxide was completely removed ) could also contribute to the observed signal . in order to explore this question , the depth distribution of the plasma induced paramagnetic states was studied by repetition of the epr determined density measurement as a function of several oxide thicknesses after the partial removal of the oxide by a wet chemical etch .",
    "for this step etch experiment , a dilute hf solution was used . after each hf - etch step , the oxide thickness was measured by ellipsometry and the areal density of the paramagnetic centers was determined by epr spectroscopy .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the results of these measurements for both the area concentration as a function of remaining oxide thickness ( a ) and the raw data given by the epr spectra of the sample recorded after the individual etch steps ( b ) .",
    "plasma are bulk defects .",
    "( b ) plots of the epr spectra measured on a - sio@xmath0 samples that have been exposed for different durations to dilute hf .",
    "the remaining oxide thickness on each sample was measured by ellipsometry .",
    ", width=321 ]    plot ( a ) also displays an offset  free linear fit which shows good agreement with the data .",
    "this agreement is indicative of a homogeneous distribution of the plasma  generated centers throughout the oxide layer . from the slope of the fit , we obtain a volume density @xmath31 . based on the measurements presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we conclude that we have found a method to generate sio@xmath0 layers with very large densities of paramagnetic e centers as needed .",
    "in order to study the thermal stability of the large ar@xmath32 plasma induced e center densities , we conducted a series of anneal experiments on high density samples that were plasma treated for 5 minutes with the plasma parameters described above .",
    "the thermal anneal was then conducted for 20min under ambient conditions at various temperatures between room temperature and 290@xmath33c .",
    "using epr , the e center s area density was then measured as described above .",
    "the results of these measurements are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the set of spectra illustrates how the plasma generated ensemble of paramagnetic states gradually disappears with increasing anneal temperature . the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) displays the e center densities that were derived from the epr measurements as a function of the preceding anneal temperatures . from the difference of the e densities of the non - annealed sample and this data ,",
    "one can obtain the density loss as a function of temperature , which is displayed as an arrhenius plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "the fit of this data with an arrhenius function reveal an activation energy of @xmath34mev .",
    "the anneal experiments show that plasma induced high e center densities can be annealed at comparatively low temperature . however , since @xmath35 , room temperature stability of the defects is observed .",

    "( c ) arrhenius plot of the density loss , the difference of the room temperature sample and the annealed samples as a function of the anneal temperature .",
    "the fit with an arrhenius function reveals a resonable agreement and a defect anneal activation energy of 0.176(1)ev.,width=321 ]    in order to further scrutinize the stability of the plasma induced high e center densities , we have conducted photo  bleaching experiments .",
    "we exposed plasma treated but not annealed sio@xmath0 layers for 60 minutes to two different light sources : ( a ) a uv source with two strong emission maxima at around 174 nm and 254 nm , and ( b ) an incandescent spectral light lamp which emits mostly in the visible wavelength range .",
    "[ fig4 ] displays two plots , each of which contain two epr spectra of the plasma etched but otherwise untreated sample and the bleached samples , respectively .",
    "the two plots ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the uv bleaching experiment and the visible light experiment , respectively .",
    "the data sets show that photo bleaching has a significant effect for both light sources as both post exposure spectra exhibit smaller e center resonances .",
    "however , in comparison to the comparatively minor loss for the visible spectral lamp ( b ) , the exposure by uv light causes a reduction of the e density by a significantly larger amount .",
    "this realization that bleaching can have similar effects as annealing could be significant for the development of low  temperature adjustment of well defined e center densities .",
    "films measured before ( black data ) and after ( red data ) a one hour exposure with uv light ( a ) and visible light ( b ) .",
    "both photo  bleaching experiments show that the light exposure leads to a reduction of the e center densities . however , this effect is significantly stronger for uv light exposure.,width=321 ]    finally , we tested the long term stability of the plasma generated high e center densities at room temperature . using epr ,",
    "we measured repeatedly the density of a plasma treated sample over a time of approximately five weeks . during this time , the sample was kept at ambient conditions and at room temperature .",
    "the results of these measurements are displayed in the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . over the course of about month , a clear decline of the e density to about half of its original value",
    "is recognizable . while this is a significant decrease , the resulting half life of the generated e center densities exceeds by far the expected duration of the single spin experiments for which the high e center densities are needed .",
    "layer after plasma treatment over the course of approximately five weeks .",
    "a gradual decline of the density is observed .",
    "however , the decay is slow enough such that even after about five weeks the absolute volume density still exceeds @xmath36.,width=321 ]",
    "the application of high density e center sio@xmath0 layers for scanning probe based spin readout requires sufficiently long spin relaxation times @xmath9 and @xmath5 . the magnetic resonance spectra discussed above",
    "give no indication that there is any microscopic difference between e centers in the high density material reported here compared to previously studied low density materials .",
    "consequently , one may hypothesize that the intrinsic relaxation behavior of an individual e center could be similar or identical in high- and low - density films .",
    "however , the decreased average density between the e centers at high densities could increase their mutual spin interactions , mostly because of spin  dipolar coupling , not because of exchange since the latter is weak due to the strong localization  @xcite of the e center . since spin ",
    "spin interaction can quench relaxation times , an experimental study of the high density e center relaxation times is necessary .    figures .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show the results of both longitudinal ( @xmath9 ) and transverse ( @xmath5 ) spin relaxation times on the high density sio@xmath0 reported above . for these measurements ,",
    "we have applied pulsed epr experiments in a temperature range of @xmath3k to @xmath4k . due to the temperature dependence of equilibrium polarization ,",
    "spin echo measurements could be conducted on the very small spin ensemble of the thin film samples only up to about 70k . however , as shown in figs .",
