    "parton - parton scattering with large momentum transfer , so - called hard scattering processes , provide unique probes for studing heavy ion collisions .",
    "the reason is simple : hard scattering occurs early in the collision , well before quark matter is expected to form .",
    "the scattered partons will sense the full space - time evolution of the collision volume and thus probe the later formed hot and dense phase .    scattering with large momentum transfer either results in the production of high mass particles , like charm quarks of which a small faction bind in @xmath2 charmonium states , or in high momentum quarks or gluons which fragment into jets of hadrons .",
    "if the scattered partons penetrate quark matter significant modifications of @xmath2 production and jet fragmentation are expected .",
    "in fact , the discovery of charmonium suppression @xcite is one of the corner stones of the argument that quark matter has been formed already at cern energies @xcite .",
    "jet production should also be altered significantly .",
    "high momentum partons should lose a significant fraction of their energy by gluon bremsstrahlung effectively suppressing jet production .",
    "this phenomenon , commonly refered to as `` jet quenching '' , was predicted a decade ago @xcite .    among the large number of produced particles present in the final state of a heavy ion collision jets can not be reconstructed directly .",
    "however , one of the jet fragments will always carry a major fraction of the jet momentum .",
    "these so - called leading particles manifest themselves in a power - law shape of the transverese momentum distribution .",
    "if jets are quenched a depletion of the high momentum tail of the spectra is expected .",
    "in addition , due to the binary nature of hard scattering processes , most jets are produced in pairs , thus azimuthal correlations between high @xmath3 particles might also serve as an experimental observable .    at cern sps energies measurements of high @xmath3 particle production where performed @xcite .",
    "a conclusive interpretation failed so far , mostly because the data can be explained by hard scattering @xcite as well as transverse flow @xcite .",
    "in contrast , first data from rhic show characteristic features consistent with the anticipated jet quenching .",
    "this talk summarizes the experimental evidence shown at qm2001 . in the next two sections data from nulceon - nucleon collisions",
    "are evaluated and used to establish a reference to which rhic data can be compared .",
    "section 4 compares inclusive charged particle production to the reference .",
    "additional information on identified particle production , and its implicitions are discussed in section 5 .",
    "the final section summarizes the talk .",
    "searching for new phenomena in heavy ion collisions requires a detailed understanding of elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "data on high momentum particle production from @xmath0 or @xmath1 collisions exists for various beam energies , but not for the initial rhic energy of @xmath4 gev .",
    "fig.[fig : ppinter ] shows inclusive charged particle @xmath3 spectra obtained from @xmath0 collisions at the isr @xcite , and from @xmath1 collisions by ua1 @xcite at cern , and by cdf at fnal @xcite . with increasing beam energy high @xmath3 particle production",
    "is enhanced , reflecting the increase of the jet production cross - section .    to generate a reference @xmath3 distribution for the initial rhic energy @xmath4 gev ,",
    "the data shown in fig.[fig : ppinter ] were fitted with the empirical functional form @xmath5 .",
    "the cross sections were then interpolated to 130 gev at several fixed @xmath3 .",
    "finally , the interpolated cross sections were fitted with the identical power - law function to obtain a smooth reference distribution .",
    "the fit parameters obtained are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the fits and the interpolation are shown in the figure .",
    "the dashed lines below and above the interpolation indicate the systematic uncertainty which results from ( i ) uncertainties in the interpolation procedure which increases with @xmath3 and more importantly ( ii ) systematic discrepancies of data sets take by different experiments .",
    "the latter error was estimated to by about 20% by comparing different data sets at similar @xmath9 .",
    "an example is given fig .",
    "[ fig : ua2 ] @xcite .",
    "the same magnitude of systematic errors on the nucleon - nucleon reference is estimated by comparing to other extrapolations done by the star collaboration @xcite and x.n .",
    "wang @xcite as well as comparing it to theoretical calculations of the cross section @xcite .",
    "to extrapolate from @xmath0 to @xmath10 collisions non - trivial assumptions need to be made .",
    "lets first assume all high @xmath3 particle production results from binary hard collisions . in the absence of nuclear effects the cross section",
    "should then simply scale by the atomic number squared @xmath11 . for a specific impact parameter selection corresponding to a fraction @xmath12 of the inelastic nucleus - nucleus cross section @xmath13 , the average number of binary collisions of the event sample @xmath14 can be calculated from the nuclear overlap integral and the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath15 @xcite :    @xmath16    in the following values of @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are used consistently .",
    "experimentally , the number of binary collisions can be evaluated from measured global observables like the forward energy or the event multiplicity by a glauber model approach ( e.g. in @xcite ) . to search for deviations from the @xmath19-reference one may divide the @xmath3 spectra from heavy ion collisions by the scaled @xmath19-reference .",
    "this ratio , denoted as @xmath20 , will be referred to as the _ nuclear modification factor _ following the suggestion from @xcite .    @xmath21    if simple scaling with the number of binary collisions holds true the nuclear modification factor @xmath20 should be unity . at low momenta ,",
    "say below 1 gev / c , @xmath20 must be smaller than one since in this @xmath3 region the cross section is expected to scale with the number of participating nucleon rather than with the number of binary collisions . thus scaling with @xmath14",
    "is expected only at high @xmath3 , say above 2 - 3 gev / c .",
    "below @xmath3 of 10 gev / c the situation is complicated by known nuclear effect . already in the late 70 s",
    "it was discovered by cronin et al .",
    "@xcite that high @xmath3 particle production in p - nucleus collisions is enhanced beyond simple binary scaling .",
    "traditionally this enhancement , now called cronin effect , has been parameterized as @xmath22 .",
    "fig.[fig : cronin ] gives a compilation of the @xmath3 dependent exponent from different fixed target experiments @xcite .",
    "though , so far there is no quantitative theoretical description of the cronin effect , it is commonly accepted that it originates from initial state multiple scattering , i.e. multiple scattering of parton in the collision @xcite .",
    "the cronin effect has also been observed in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "data taken at cern has been recently compiled and analyzed in terms of the nuclear modification factor @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : cern - nmf ] reproduces a figure from @xcite showing @xmath20 for pb - pb collisions . @xmath20",
    "continuously increases , crosses unity around 1.5 gev / c and eventually saturates above 2.5 gev at a value @xmath23 2 . at higher energies a similar behavior",
    "is expected , though one might expect a reduction with increasing energy @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "if previously observed phenomena are included , at rhic @xmath20 should be above the naive binary scaling , which probably underestimates @xmath20 and below the empirically observed value from cern , which might overestimate @xmath20 .",
    "this conclusion implicitly assumes that ( i ) the relative particle abundances  in particular at high @xmath3  do not change going from nucleon - nucleon to nucleus - nucleus extracted from rhic data collisions , and that ( ii ) collective radial flow as well as ( iii ) shadowing do not alter the spectra at high @xmath3 significantly .",
    "fig.[fig : pt_compare ] compares the inclusive @xmath3 distribution of negatively charged hadrons from star @xcite to the spectra of all charged hadrons presented by phenix @xcite .",
    "both data sets are obtained from the 5% most central au - au collisions at pseudo - rapidity zero .",
    "the data are consistent over the entire range observed out to 5 gev / c .",
    "this is remarkable , given the preliminary nature of the data and the known difficulties of absolute measurements .",
    "there are subtle difference between the data sets which amount less than 40% and are largest around 2 gev / c .",
    "this difference is used to estimate the systematic error on the absolute normalization . in the following the error",
    "is assumed to be @xmath2420% , which is consistent with the errors quoted by the experiments .    to compare to the @xmath19-reference the nuclear modification factor is calculated .",
    "the @xmath19-reference was scaled by @xmath25 determined by phenix @xcite .",
    "star used a value of @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27 @xcite to scale their reference .",
    "the difference of both values is used as systematic uncertainty of 15% on @xmath28 .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the @xmath29 15% error given by phenix .",
    "the resulting nuclear modification factor @xmath20 is shown in fig.[fig : pt_nmf ] . on a linear scale the subtle differences between the data sets",
    "become more apparent .",
    "the systematic errors on @xmath20 are indicated by the full line , they results from ( i ) the error on the @xmath19-reference ( @xmath2920% but @xmath3 dependent ) , ( ii ) a 20% error on the normalization , and ( iii ) a 15% error on @xmath14 .",
    "the errors quoted here are somewhat larger than those evaluated by phenix and star , the reason is two fold : ( i ) the errors take into account the differences between the data and ( ii ) the error on the @xmath19-reference was estimated more conservatively .    initially , @xmath20 increases up to a @xmath3 of about 2 gev / c where it saturates at a value of 0.6 to 0.8 . at high @xmath3",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath20 seems to decrease again . in the region from 2 to 3 gev @xmath20 might be consistent with unity within the rather large systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , it is not converging towards one at higher @xmath3 , as suggested by simple binary scaling .",
    "the figure also indicates @xmath20 observed at the cern - sps ( dash - dotted line ) . obviously , @xmath20 at rhic is significantly below the value found for cern sps data .",
    "phenix has also presented a systematic survey of different centrality selections .",
    "the data are shown in fig.[fig : phenix_charged ] .",
    "the spectra for the most peripheral collisions exhibit a pronounced power - law shape which seems to vanish for the most central selection .",
    "the significant difference between central and peripheral collisions is more clearly visible in the ratio , which is depicted in fig.[fig : ratio_cp ] . to compare to the binary scaling assumption and",
    "to @xmath20 the cross sections were normalized by the number of binary collisions for the specific centrality selection . the large uncertainty in @xmath14 for the peripheral data sets ( @xmath30 ) is reflected by the error band also shown in the figure ; this ia an uncertainty on the absolute scale of the ratio but not on its @xmath3 dependence .    both ratios , central 5% to 80 - 92% and to 60 - 80% show the same trend : a rise up to @xmath3 of 1.5 - 2",
    "gev / c followed by a decrease at higher momenta .",
    "such a behavior is qualitatively in agreement with a power - law spectrum becoming more exponential with increasing centrality . within the systematic errors the ratio could be close to one , but as in fig.[fig : pt_nmf ]",
    "the ratio does not converge towards unity at large @xmath3 as suggested by the binary scaling scenario . if one assumes that peripheral collisions resemble nucleon - nucleon interactions one can interpret the ratio shown in fig.[fig : ratio_cp ] as an alternative measure of the @xmath20 .",
    "the ratio derived here and @xmath20 shown in fig.[fig : pt_nmf ] agree reasonably well .",
    "although the systematic errors have similar size they have very different origin .    that something interesting is happening at high @xmath3 is corroborated by data on azimuthal angular correlations presented by star @xcite .",
    "the data is presented in fig.[fig : v2 ] in terms of the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal track density distribution measured with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the coefficient @xmath31 measures an anisotropy of particle production relative to the reaction plane , which is typically interpreted as elliptic flow . at",
    "low @xmath3 @xmath31 continuously increases at a rate predicted by model calculations based on hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "around 2 gev / c the pattern changes and @xmath31 seems to saturate . at high @xmath3 , say above 2 gev / c , particle production can no longer be described by hydrodynamics and consequently the anisotropy is expected to vanish .",
    "interestingly , the saturation of @xmath31 and @xmath20 occur at similar @xmath3 suggesting a possible connection of both phenomena .    angular correlations between jets should not contribute to @xmath31 because jet production is uncorrelated to the reaction plane .",
    "if , however , jets loose significant energy in the dense medium an anisotropy will be introduced by the geometry of the reaction volume . in transverse direction , perpendicularly to the beam axis , the reaction volume will be almond shaped for non - zero impact parameter .",
    "thus , the average path length of a jet in the dense medium will be smaller in plane than out of plane .",
    "it is plausible that jets produced out of plane will loose more energy than those produced in plane , effectively leading to an anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane at medium and high momenta .",
    "the figure compares the data to a recent theoretical calculation @xcite which combines a hydrodynamic calculation with perterbative qcd , and modeles jet production quenched by energy loss .",
    "the different curves correspond to different initial gluon densities ; for a density of 500 the model simultaneously describes also the @xmath3 spectra reasonably well .",
    "additional information on high @xmath3 production of neutral pion , proton and anti - proton is available from phenix @xcite .",
    "these first data show that in au - au collisions a much smaller fraction of the high @xmath3 charged particles are pions than in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "minimum bias data for @xmath32 and @xmath33 is presented in fig.[fig : hadrons ] . above 2.0 gev",
    "/ c the ratio @xmath34 ( as well as the @xmath35 ratio ) approaches unity , significantly larger than the value of @xmath36 observed in @xmath0 collisions at the isr .",
    "in addition , the spectra suggest that @xmath34 continues to increase towards higher @xmath3 , quite different from @xmath37 scaling found in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "large collective radial flow in heavy ion collision might offer a possible explanation @xcite .",
    "independent of the interpretation , at high @xmath3 the particle compositions in au - au at rhic deviates from @xmath0 collision where the ratio @xmath38 was about @xmath39 above 1.5 gev / c . from fig.[fig : hadrons ] one deduces @xmath38 of about 2 at 1.5 gev / c , increasing to @xmath40 at about 2.2 gev / c .",
    "thus @xmath20 measured for charged particles should not be interpreted as nuclear modification factor for pions .",
    "@xmath20 underestimates the depletion of pion production by approximately a factor @xmath291.5 .",
    "the measurement of neutral pions by phenix @xcite reveals directly the more substantial suppression of high @xmath3 pion production .",
    "two data sets are given in fig.[fig : pi0 ] , a 10% central and a peripheral ( 60 - 80% ) event selection .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the absolute normalization is included in the error bars .",
    "both data sets are compared to the nucleon - nucleon reference . here",
    "the reference , which was deduced for charged particles in section 2 , was scaled down by the @xmath38 ratio of 1.6 observed at the isr .",
    "the systematic error bands shown in the figure contain the uncertainty of the reference ( see section 2 ) , a 10% error on the @xmath38 scale factor , as well as 15% and 60% error on the number of binary collisions for central and peripheral data , respectively .",
    "while the peripheral data are well described by the reference distribution , the central data are significantly below . from the ratio of the data to the @xmath19-reference",
    "one deduces an average nuclear modification factor of @xmath41 for neutral pions in central collisions .",
    "this value is smaller by a factor of 1.5 compared to @xmath20 obtained for charged particles , consistent with the large @xmath42 and @xmath33 yield at high @xmath3 . for the peripheral data ,",
    "@xmath20 is about unity reflecting the good agreement of the data and the @xmath19-reference .    as alternative measure of @xmath20 fig.[fig : ratio - pio - cp ] gives the ratio of central to peripheral data . for all @xmath3",
    "the ratio is below unity , indicating the substantial suppression of the yield in central collisions relative to the binary scaling assumption . very similar to the charged particle data the ratio peaks between 1.5 and 2 gev / c and decreases towards higher @xmath3 .",
    "finally in figure [ fig : wang ] , the neutral pion data are compared to theoretical model calculations by x.n .",
    "wang @xcite .",
    "three different calculations are shown : ( i ) an estimate of the scaled @xmath19-reference , ( ii ) a scaled reference modified by modeling the cronin effect ( here called @xmath3-broadening ) and shadowing , as well as ( iii ) a calculation inferring `` jet quenching '' by introducing an average energy loss of 0.25 gev / fm for the scattered partons .",
    "the peripheral data agrees reasonably well with all three scenarios while the central data are significantly below the calculations not including energy loss .",
    "only a few months after the end of its first au - au run , rhic has produced a surprisingly rich sample of data , reaching out in @xmath3 well into a region where a significant contribution of hard scattering processes is expected . in central collisions a depletion of high @xmath3 particle production is discovered . this depletion is observed in charged particle production measured by star and phenix as well as in neutral pion data from phenix .",
    "the same depletion is found when comparing central to peripheral data .",
    "additional information results from azimuthal anisotropy of particle production .",
    "all observations are consistent with a scenario in which quark matter formed during the collision suppresses jet production .    whether these first hints for `` jet quenching",
    "'' will hold true remains to be seen .",
    "drawing definite and quantitative conclusions from the present data certainly is premature in particular in view of the large systematic uncertainties . besides better control of the absolute normalization it will be essential to measure the @xmath19-reference in the same experiments . data at higher",
    "@xmath3 will help to disentangle soft physics like radial flow from hard scattering .    at the end",
