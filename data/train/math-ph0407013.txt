    "there are many problems concerning electronic structure where attention is focussed on a small region of a larger system , at surfaces or defects in crystals being perhaps the most common .",
    "let us call this region i , figure [ fig:1 ] , and the rest of the system region ii .",
    "although not of primary interest region ii can not be ignored , since in general the electron wave functions in i will be sensitive to the contents of region ii .",
    "some time ago inglesfield @xcite derived an embedding scheme which enables the single - particle schrdinger equation to be solved explicitly only in region i. the influence of region ii is taken into account exactly by adding an energy - dependent non - local potential to the hamiltonian for region i , which constrains the solutions in i to match onto solutions in ii .",
    "this embedding method has been developed into a powerful tool most notably for surface electronic structure problems @xcite where it has found widespread application especially to situations where an accurate description of the spectrum of electron states is necessary .",
    "examples include studies of image states @xcite , surface states at metals surfaces @xcite , static and dynamic screening @xcite , atomic adsorption and scattering at surfaces @xcite , studies of surface optical response @xcite and field emission @xcite .",
    "recent applications to transport problems have also been described @xcite . for a review of the embedding method",
    "see inglesfield @xcite .",
    "= 80 mm    in the case of materials containing heavier elements , relativistic effects can be significant @xcite and lead to important deviations from the electronic structure as predicted by the schrdinger equation  shifts in inner core levels of 5d elements are typically several 100 or 1000 ev , valence bands shifts are on the ev scale and spin orbit splitting is often measured in tenths of ev . even ignoring the concomitant changes in electron wave functions these shifts can reorder levels and so affect calculated densities , fundamental to the determination of ground state properties within the density functional framework @xcite .",
    "for this reason most of the conventional electronic structure techniques developed for accurately solving the single - particle schrdinger equation in solids have subsequently been modified to deal with the dirac equation , including the relativistic augmented plane wave method @xcite , relativistic linear muffin - tin orbital method @xcite , relativistic augmented spherical wave method @xcite and the relativistic multiple - scattering method @xcite , and each has subsequently been used in studying a diverse range of problems .",
    "the last method alone has formed the basis of calculations of photoemission @xcite , magnetocrystalline anisotropy @xcite , hyperfine interactions @xcite and magnetotransport @xcite amongst other topics .",
    "inglesfield s embedding method has particular advantages that encourage its extension to the relativistic case .",
    "it permits the inclusion of extended substrates for surface and interface calculations , enables the study of isolated point defects in solids and being a basis set technique is highly flexible and permits full - potential studies with relative ease . at surfaces extended substrates ( as against the use of the supercell or thin - film approximation in which the crystal is approximated by a small number of layers , typically 5 - 7 ) enable the proper distinction between surface states , resonances and the continuum of bulk states @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the w(110 ) surface @xcite where the addition of half a monolayer of li is observed to _ increase _ the spin - orbit splitting of a surface state by @xmath2 ev ( resulting in fermi surface crossings separated by @xmath3% of the brillouin zone dimension ) typifies a type of problem a relativistic embedding scheme could address .",
    "indeed each of the topics mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph are relevant at surfaces and/or interfaces , and could be usefully investigated within a relativistic embedding framework .    in this paper",
    "we develop an embedding scheme for the dirac equation that parallels inglesfield s scheme for the schrdinger equation .",
    "inglesfield s starting point is the expectation value of the hamiltonian using a trial wave function which is continuous in amplitude but discontinuous in derivative across the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii .",
    "the first order nature of the dirac equation precludes the use of a similar trial function .",
    "instead , in the following section we use a trial function in which the large component is continuous and the small component discontinuous across @xmath1 .",
    "continuity in the small component is restored when the resulting equations are solved exactly . using the green function for region",
    "ii we are able to derive an expression for the expectation value purely in terms of the trial function in i. in section [ section : app ] the application of the method is illustrated by calculating the eigenstates of a hydrogen atom within a cavity and in section [ section : green ] we determine the green function for the embedded region .",
    "section [ section : monolayer ] briefly illustrates the method applied to a sandwich structure where relativistic effects are marked .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and discussion .",
    "in this section we consider region i joined onto region ii ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) , and derive a variational principle for a trial wave function @xmath4 defined explicitly only within region i. we are primarily interested in the positive energy solutions of the dirac equation @xcite , and so we refer to the upper and lower spinors of the dirac bi - spinor solutions as the large and small components of the wave function respectively .",
    "we notionally extend @xmath4 into ii as @xmath5 , an exact solution of the dirac equation at some energy @xmath6 , with the large components of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) matching on the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii , but with no constraint upon the small components ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , figure [ fig:2 ] .",

    "( for clarity we omit the interaction @xmath14 which appears in the relativistic density functional theory @xcite neglecting orbital and displacement currents , where @xmath15 is a `` spin - only '' effective magnetic field containing an external and exchange - correlation contribution .",
    "its inclusion has no consequences for the derivation . )",
    "the first two terms in the numerator are the expectation value of the hamiltonian through regions i and ii , and the third the contribution due to the discontinuity in the small component of the wave function on @xmath1 ( in this and the following , surface normals are directed from i to ii ) .",

    "the inset in figure [ fig:5 ] shows the local density of states in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath141 ) , indicating the significant relativistic effects on the electronic structure which are correctly reproduced with this dirac - embedding scheme .",
    "we have outline above an embedding scheme for the dirac equation .",
    "it enables the dirac equation to be solved within a limited region i when this region forms part of a larger system , i@xmath102ii .",
    "region ii is replaced by an additional term added to the hamiltonian for region i , and which acts on the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii .",
    "the embedding scheme is derived using a trial function in which continuity in the small component across @xmath1 is imposed variationally .",
    "expanding the wave function in a basis set of separate large and small component spinors , the problem of variational collapse is avoided by using a basis satisfying kinetic balance . calculating the spectrum of a confined hydrogen atom , the method is shown to be stable and converge to the exact eigenvalues .",
    "we have also derived the green function for the embedded hamiltonian and illustrated its use in the continuum regime of the same confined hydrogen system and an au / ag / au sandwich structure .",
    "these are demonstration calculations ",
    "future applications are likely to be to defects and surfaces of materials containing heavier ( typically 5@xmath142 ) elements , within the framework of density functional theory .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss further the use of a trial function that is discontinuous in the small component , since such a wave function gives rise to a discontinuous probability density and so would normally be dismissed in quantum theory . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "discontinuous trial functions are not permitted , since they possess infinite energy .",
    "however the dirac equation is first order in @xmath143 and as we have seen a perfectly regular expectation value of @xmath0 results . exploiting this freedom",
    ", the embedding scheme outlined above leads to solutions that are continuous in both large and small component _ only _ when the embedding potential @xmath144 is evaluated at the same energy @xmath6 as the energy @xmath11 that appears in the dirac equation itself , for then the relationship between small and large components on @xmath1 inside ( equation [ eqn : de2 ] ) and outside ( equation [ eqn : cgc ] ) coincide , the large components matching by construction .",
    "this may be achieved for example via the iterative scheme used in connection with equation ( [ eqn : exp3 ] ) and the final column of table [ table:1 ] , or explicitly when determining the green function as in section [ section : green ] .",
    "these are the methods in which the non - relativistic embedding scheme has been most widely used .",
    "when @xmath6 and @xmath11 do not coincide , the solutions obtained via this embedding scheme will retain small components that are discontinuous across @xmath1 .",
    "this may be unacceptable for certain applications , but the solutions continue to be valid approximations at least in as much as they provide estimates of the energies of the solutions of the dirac equation , and so could suffice e.g. for interpreting spectroscopic measurements .",
    "this embedding scheme places no greater emphasis on a discontinuity in the small amplitude at @xmath1 than on an incorrect ( but continuous ) amplitude elsewhere within the embedded region .",
    "it aims merely to optimise the energy of the state , and will retain a discontinuity in the small component if in doing so it can better ( in terms of energy ) approximate the solution inside the embedded region . in the non - relativistic embedding scheme",
    "the discontinuous derivative of the trial function implies a probability current ( and electric current ) that is discontinuous across the embedding surface .",
    "this is similarly unphysical , yet numerous applications such as those cited above have demonstrated the utility and accuracy of the method . indeed , there have been many applications in which this scheme has been used to determine currents and or transport properties , such as in relation to surface optical response @xcite and electron transport in electron waveguides or through domain walls @xcite .",
    "the reason for the success of these calculations is that they employed schemes in which the embedding potential was evaluated at the correct energy , ensuring that the derivative of the wavefunction was continuous across @xmath1 . in practise",
    "there have been few calculations using the non - relativistic embedding scheme in which the energies did not coincide .",
    "there are a number of aspects of the method which are worthy of further consideration .",
    "we started with a trial function in which by construction the large component was continuous and the small component discontinuous across the surface @xmath1 dividing i and ii .",
    "we could have reversed these conditions , leading to a similar embedded dirac equation but with a modified embedding term .",
    "the particular choice was motivated by the wish to have a theory which behaves reasonably in the limit @xmath141 when the small component becomes negligible  a discontinuous amplitude is not permissible in trial solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , the behaviour of the alternative formulation should be investigated . perhaps in connection with this there is the question of the spectrum of negative energy solutions , to which we have paid scant attention .",
    "exploring the @xmath141 limit it might be possible to identify how to embed a relativistic region i within a region ii treated non - relativistically ",
    "a 5@xmath142 overlayer on a simple metal substrate might be a physical system where such a treatment is appropriate",
    ". there could be benefits in terms of computational resources expended if the embedding potential could be determined within the framework of a non - relativistic calculation , and there might also be useful insights in terms of simple models .",
    "finally , in terms of implementation for realistic systems , some of the novel schemes for deriving embedding potentials @xcite could certainly be adapted to the relativistic case .",
    "it would also be worthwhile to consider whether it is possible to use a restricted electron - like basis , in which the large and small component spinors are combined .",
    "this is common practice in most relativistic electronic structure calculations for solids when using basis set techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) , and would result in significant computational efficiencies ."
