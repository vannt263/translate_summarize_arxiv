    "a detailed investigation of these outliers and their mass - loss activity is beyond the scope of this paper , but will be addressed in future papers .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that these outliers should be removed from the sample .",
    "figure [ rawpl ] also suggests that a period cut is needed for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 band data , as the data approaches the faint magnitude limit for the short period cepheids .",

    "a change of slope for smc p - l relations at @xmath29 has been reported in the literature @xcite .",

    "it is clear from figure [ rawpl ] that the shallow slopes for @xmath3 and @xmath4 band p - l relations with @xmath43 , as shown in figure [ lpcut ] , are due to the lack of cepheids at the short period end , where the magnitudes approach the faint limit in these two _ irac _ bands .",
    "a period cut of @xmath44 is necessary to remove the bias due to the incomplete data at the faint magnitude end . inspecting figure [ lpcut ]",
    "suggests that the slope of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 band p - l relations begin to stabilize at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "hence , we have adopted a period at @xmath47 and @xmath48 when deriving the p - l relations in these two bands .",
    "the resulting p - l relations are :    @xmath49    the ratios of the number of cepheids with @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 band , respectively , after the period cut .",
    "therefore the @xmath36-test can be applied to the data in order to test for non - linearity at @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath36-test results show that both of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 band p - l relations are linear , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",

    "if the _ irac _ band p - l slopes were indeed shallow , then the slopes from all three galaxies would be consistent ( despite the large uncertainties for gal3 slopes shown in table [ slopecompare ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the metallicity will not strongly affect the _ irac _ band p - l slopes . on the other hand , if the galactic and lmc p - l slopes were steeper ( for those listed as gal1/2 and lmc1 in table [ slopecompare ] )",
