    "the search for mathematical entities that could describe physical phenomena has always been a top priority . for example , the need to describe a direction in space , combined with the use of geometry to approach physical problems , brought forth the concept of a vector .",
    "the idea that the complex numbers have a geometrical interpretation as vectors lying in a plane , led to hamilton to introduce quaternions with the aim of being useful for the analysis of three - dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "the price to be paid is that the composition of quaternions is not commutative .",
    "soon after that , it became clear that rotations can be advantageously represented by unit quaternions .",
    "a notion closely related to hamilton treatment is that of turns  @xcite . the turn associated with a rotation of axis @xmath0 and angle @xmath1 is a directed arc of length @xmath2 on the great circle orthogonal to @xmath0 on the unit sphere . by means of these objects ,",
    "the composition of rotations is described through a parallelogramlike law : if these turns are translated on the great circles , until the head of the arc of the first rotation coincides with the tail of the arc of the second one , then the turn between the free tail and the head is associated with the resultant rotation .",
    "hamilton turns are thus analogous for spherical geometry to the sliding vectors in euclidean geometry .    in recent years",
    "many concepts of geometrical nature have been introduced to gain further insights into the behavior of layered media .",
    "the algebraic basis for these developments is the fact that the transfer matrix associated with a lossless multilayer is an element of the group su(1 ,  1 ) , which is locally isomorphic to the lorentz group so(2 ,  1 ) in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "this leads to a natural and complete identification between reflection and transmission coefficients and the parameters of the corresponding lorentz transformation  @xcite .    in an appealing paper , jurez and santander",
    "@xcite developed a generalization of hamilton turns to the lorentz group , while simon , mukunda , and sudarshan  @xcite worked out an equivalent algebraic approach for su(1 ,  1 ) , in which they introduce a noncommutative geometrical addition for these hyperbolic turns that reproduces the composition law of the group ; i. e. , for both the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "the latter coefficients seem to be ( almost ) ignored in the literature .",
    "the goal of this paper is precisely to show how this formalism affords a very intuitive image of multilayer optics .    of course",
    ", since the amplitude and phase of a light beam can be conveniently represented by a ( euclidean ) vector , the properties of layered media have been represented by graphical constructions .",
    "these visualization tools are commonly in use in thin - film design and include the smith chart , the admittance diagram  @xcite , the ( reflectance ) circle diagrams  @xcite , and the vector method  @xcite , among others .",
    "however , the formalism of turns is intrinsic and does not rely on any specific representation for the light waves .",
    "in other words , once the turn for a multilayer is known , his action on any light state is fully determined .",
    "we emphasize that , although , these techniques can be used for quantitative calculations , they can not compete nowadays with modern software design , and their great value is in the visualization of the characteristics of a multilayer .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present some details of how the action of any multilayer can be seen as a geometrical motion in the unit disk .",
    "every one of these motions can be decomposed in terms of two reflections , which justifies the idea of turn introduced in section 3 , where their composition law is also introduced via a parallelogram law , in close analogy with what happens for sliding vectors in euclidean geometry .",
    "the noncommutative character of this law leads to interesting phenomena , such as the appearance of extra phases in the composition of multilayers , which is examined in section 4 , giving a simple though nontrivial example that illustrates clearly how this geometrical scenario works in practice .",
    "the theory of reflection and transmission of light by stratified planar structures is of wide interest in optics . a considerable amount of theoretical work has been done on this topic , a detailed discussion of which can be found in a number of books  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the standard method uses a matrix representation of the field in each medium , as pioneered by abels  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we follow the elegant approach developed by hayfield and white  @xcite .",
    "we deal with a stratified structure that consists of a stack of plane - parallel layers sandwiched between two semi - infinite ambient ( @xmath3 ) and substrate ( @xmath4 ) media that we shall assume to be identical , in order to simplify as much as possible the calculations .",
    "hereafter all the media are supposed to be lossless , linear , homogeneous , and isotropic .",
    "we choose the @xmath5 axis perpendicular to the boundaries and directed as in fig .  1 .",
    "a monochromatic linearly polarized plane wave falls from the ambient making an angle @xmath6 with the normal to the first interface and with an amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "the electric field is either in the plane of incidence ( @xmath8 polarization ) or perpendicular to the plane of incidence ( @xmath4 polarization ) .",
    "since the multilayer has two input channels , we consider as well another plane wave of the same frequency and polarization , and with amplitude @xmath9 , incident from the substrate at the same angle @xmath6 .",
    "this guarantees that all the multiple reflected and transmitted waves superpose with the same wave vectors .",
    "the overall output fields in the ambient and the substrate will be denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . in the common experimental situation",
    ", there is no light incident from the substrate [ @xmath12 , although there are relevant situations in which both input fields are present ( e. g. , at the beam splitter in a michelson interferometer ) .",
    "the field amplitudes at each side of the multilayer are related by the linear relation @xmath13 where the multilayer transfer matrix @xmath14 can be shown to be  @xcite @xmath15 \\equiv \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\beta^\\ast & \\alpha^\\ast \\end{array } \\right ] .\\ ] ] here the complex numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which can be expressed as @xmath18 are , respectively , the overall reflection and transmission coefficients for a wave incident from the ambient . because @xmath19 , and then @xmath14 belongs to the group su(1 ,  1 ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have proposed viewing the multilayer action in a relativisticlike framework , giving a formal equivalence between the fields in eq .",
    "( [ evec ] ) and space - time coordinates in a @xmath20-dimensional space .",
    "these coordinates verify @xmath21 , which defines a unit two - sheeted hyperboloid characteristic of the group so(2 ,  1 ) .",
    "if one uses stereographic projection taking the south pole as projection center , the upper sheet of the unit hyperboloid is projected into the unit disk , the lower sheet into the external region , while the infinity goes to the boundary of the unit disk .",
    "the geodesics in the hyperboloid are intersections with the hyperboloid of planes passing through the origin .",
    "consequently , hyperbolic lines are obtained from these by stereographic projection and they correspond to circle arcs that orthogonally cut the boundary of the unit disk .    in many instances ( e.g. , in polarization optics  @xcite ) we are interested in the transformation properties of field quotients rather than the fields themselves .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to consider the complex numbers @xmath22 the action of the multilayer given in eq .",
    "( [ mlossless ] ) can be then seen as a function @xmath23 that can be appropriately called the multilayer transfer function  @xcite .    from a geometrical viewpoint",
    ", this function defines a transformation of the complex plane , mapping the point @xmath24 into the point @xmath25 , according to  @xcite @xmath26 = \\frac{\\beta^\\ast + \\alpha^\\ast z_s } { \\alpha + \\beta z_s } \\ , \\ ] ] which is a bilinear or mbius transformation .",
    "one can check that the unit disk , the external region and the unit circle remain invariant under the multilayer action .",
    "note also that , when no light impinges from the substrate @xmath27 and then @xmath28 . it is worth mentioning that this approach is quite general , since it provides the transformed of any point in the unit disk for every values of the input fields @xmath7 and @xmath9 .    to classify the multilayer action it proves convenient to work out the fixed points of the mapping ; that is , the field configurations such that @xmath29 in eq .",

    "we will be concerned only with the case @xmath33 ^ 2 > 4 $ ] , since it is known that any element of su(1 ,  1 ) can be written ( in many ways ) as the product of two hyperbolic translations  @xcite .",
    "the axis of the hyperbolic translation is the geodesic line joining the two fixed points .",
    "a point on the axis will be translated to another point , a ( hyperbolic ) distance  @xcite @xmath35 ^ 2 - 4 } \\right \\ } \\right ) \\ ] ] along the axis .",
    "in euclidean geometry , a translation of magnitude @xmath36 along a line @xmath37 can be seen as the product of two reflections in any two straight lines orthogonal to @xmath37 , separated a distance @xmath38 .",
    "this idea can be translated much in the same way to the unit disk , once the concepts of line and distance are understood in the hyperbolic sense . in consequence ,",
    "any pair of points @xmath39 and @xmath40 on the axis of the translation @xmath37 at a distance @xmath38 can be chosen as intersections of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( orthogonal lines to @xmath37 ) with @xmath37 .",
    "it is then natural to associate to the translation an oriented segment of length @xmath38 on @xmath37 , but otherwise free to slide on @xmath37 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is analogous to hamilton s turns , and will be called a hyperbolic turn @xmath43 .",
    "note that using this construction , an off - axis point such as @xmath24 will be mapped by these two reflections ( through an intermediate point @xmath44 ) to another point @xmath25 along a curve equidistant to the axis .",
    "these other curves , unlike the axis of translation , are not hyperbolic lines .",
    "the essential point is that once the turn is known , the transformation of every point in the unit disk is automatically established .",
    "alternatively , we can formulate the concept of turn as follows .",
    "let @xmath14 be a hyperbolic translation with @xmath45 positive ( equivalently , @xmath46 ) .",
    "then , @xmath14 is positive definite and one can ensure that its square root exists and reads as @xmath47 } } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\alpha + 1 &   \\beta \\\\ \\beta^\\ast & \\alpha^\\ast + 1 \\end{array } \\right ] .\\ ] ] this matrix has the same fixed points as @xmath14 , but the translated distance is just half the induced by @xmath14 ; i.e. , @xmath48 this suggests that the matrix @xmath49 can be appropriately associated to the turn @xmath43 that represents the translation induced by @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we symbolically write @xmath50    one may be tempted to extend the euclidean composition of concurrent vectors to the problem of hyperbolic turns .",
    "indeed , this can be done quite straightforwardly  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the case of the composition of two of these multilayers represented by the matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( for simplicity , we shall henceforth omit the subscript @xmath53 ) of parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 along intersecting axes @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "take the associated turns @xmath58 and @xmath59 and slide them along @xmath56 and @xmath57 until they are  head to tail \" .",
    "afterwards , the turn determined by the free tail and head is the turn associated to the resultant , which represents thus a translation of parameter @xmath36 along the line @xmath37 .",
    "this construction is shown in fig .  3 , where the noncommutative character is also evident .",
    "in euclidean geometry , the resultant of this parallelogram law can be quantitatively determined by a direct application of the cosine theorem . for any hyperbolic triangle with sides of lengths @xmath54 and @xmath55 that make an angle @xmath60 , we take the expression from any standard book on hyperbolic geometry  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath60 is the angle between both sides . moreover , for future use we quote that the ( hyperbolic ) area @xmath62 of the geodesic triangle is @xmath63",
    "to show how this formalism can account for the existence of peculiar effects in the composition of multilayers , we address here the question of the wigner angle in the unit disk and propose a simple optical experiment to determine this angle .",
    "the wigner angle emerges in the study of the composition of two noncollinear pure boosts in special relativity : the combination of two such successive boosts can not result in a pure boost , but renders an additional pure rotation , usually known as the wigner rotation  @xcite ( sometimes the name of thomas rotation  @xcite is also used ) . in other words , boosts are not a group .    to fix the physical background , consider three frames of reference @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "frames @xmath64-@xmath65 and @xmath65-@xmath66 have parallel respective axes .",
    "frame @xmath66 moves with uniform velocity @xmath67 with respect to @xmath65 , which in turn moves with velocity @xmath68 relative to @xmath64 .",
    "the lorentz transformation that connects @xmath64 with @xmath66 is given by the product @xmath69 , which can be decomposed as @xmath70 where one must be careful in operating just in the same order as written in eq .",
    "( [ bcom ] ) . in words",
    ", this means that an observer in @xmath64 sees the axes of @xmath66 rotated relative to the observer s own axes by a wigner rotation described by @xmath71 .",
    "the explicit expression for the axis and angle of this rotation can be found , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be worked out below from the perspective of the multilayer action in the unit disk .",
    "first , we observe that any matrix @xmath72 su(1 ,  1 ) can be expressed in a unique way in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is positive definite hermitian and @xmath75 is unitary .",
    "one can check by simple inspection that the explicit form of this ( polar ) decomposition reads as  @xcite @xmath76 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\exp ( - i \\tau ) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp ( i \\tau ) \\end{array } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the component @xmath74 is equivalent to a pure boost , while @xmath75 is equivalent to a spatial rotation .",
