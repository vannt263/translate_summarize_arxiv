    "superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands provide us with an opportunity of studying a finite quantum many - body system at the limits of a strong coriolis field and large deformation . as an example of elementary excitations in rapidly rotating nuclei , low - frequency vibrational motion at high spin is of great interest . since the large deformation and",
    "the rapid rotation of sd bands may produce a novel shell structure , we expect features of surface vibrational motions quite different from those of spherical and normal - deformed ( nd ) nuclei . in this paper quadrupole and octupole",
    "vibrations built on the sd yrast band are discussed in terms of a microscopic model based on the cranked mean field extended by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .    in a recent paper@xcite",
    "( to which we refer hereafter as nmms ) , we have discussed the quadrupole and octupole correlations in excited sd bands in @xmath2hg .",
    "we have found that the @xmath0 octupole vibrations are the lowest excitation modes in these sd nuclei and the interplay between rotation and vibrations produces different effects depending on neutron number . from a comparison with the experimental @xmath1 moments of inertia , we have proposed a new interpretation that most of the observed excited bands are the ( @xmath0 ) octupole vibrations . in this paper , we extend this work to all even - even sd nuclei observed in a=190 region and compare our theoretical results with new experimental data .",
    "assuming that the observed excited sd bands correspond to the lowest octupole vibrations , the observed properties ( routhians , @xmath1 moments of inertia , and linking transitions into the yrast sd bands ) will be consistently explained for all even - even a=190 nuclei .",
    "before discussing explicit examples of excited sd bands , let us discuss the characteristics of elementary excitation modes in high - spin sd and nd states in even - even nuclei .",
    "nd nuclei belong to a family of nuclei with `` open - shell '' configurations . at low spin , since the pairing correlations produce an energy gap @xmath3 ( typically 1 mev ) , the excitation energies of the lowest two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) states are at least @xmath4 mev and the collective ( isoscalar ) excitations become the lowest excitation modes which have been universally observed in experiments",
    ". however , this situation is changed at high spin by many rotationally aligned 2qp  states coming down rapidly with frequency .",
    "these aligned 2qp  bands erase the energy gap and become the dominant modes of low - energy excitation .",
    "thus , at present , very few experimental data are available for the collective modes of excitation at high spin .    on the other hand , sd nuclei are characterized as `` closed - shell '' nuclei with a large shell gap near the fermi surface . in addition",
    ", the large deformation tends to reduce the aligned angular momenta of high-@xmath5 orbitals .",
    "these properties of the sd shape keep an energy gap in the quasiparticle spectra even in the high - spin region .",
    "( see quasiparticle routhians in nmms and compare them with those of nd nuclei , e.g. , in ref.@xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the collective states may be still the lowest modes even at high spin . in this sense",
    ", the sd nuclei could provide an observatory of the collective excitations in rapidly rotating systems .    in the a=150 region , the behavior of excited sd bands",
    "have been well accounted for as single - particle excitations except for a few cases in @xmath6dy@xcite , @xmath7gd@xcite , and @xmath8gd@xcite .",
    "this may be because the pairing correlations are extremely suppressed in the a=150 region .",
    "since the pairing correlations may increase the quadrupole and octupole collectivity , we expect the different feature of near - yrast excitation spectra in the a=190 region .    in even - even sd a=190 nuclei ,",
    "most of excited bands have @xmath1 moments of inertia very similar to those of the yrast sd bands , which show a gradual increase with frequency . on the other hand , atypical @xmath1 moments almost constant with frequency",
    "have been observed universally in odd - a sd nuclei and have been explained by invoking occupation of a quasiparticle state associated with neutron @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) orbitals@xcite .",
    "these experiments provide important information on the quasiparticle spectra around the @xmath11 sd shell gap , which tells us the @xmath9 orbitals is the lowest at high frequency and the blocking of the @xmath9 orbitals leads to the lack of alignment producing a constant @xmath1 . if we try to interpret the excited bands in even - even nuclei as the simple 2qp  states , it is a puzzle why the similar atypical @xmath1 have not been observed in the even - even cases .",
    "we will show in the next section that the collective excitations can provide a possible answer to this mystery .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review of our theoretical model and discuss the @xmath1 moments of inertia for the excited bands .",
    "see nmms for a complete description of the model and details of numerical calculations .    in the cranked shell model extended by the rpa theory ,",
    "vibrational excitations built on the rotating vacuum are microscopically described by superpositions of a large number of 2qp  states .",
    "the rpa also allows us to describe non - collective 2qp  excitations and weakly collective states which are difficult to discuss by means of macroscopic models .",
    "effects of the coriolis force on these various modes of excitation are automatically taken into account in rpa solutions since the mean field is affected by the cranking term @xmath12 .    the model hamiltonian is assumed to be of the form : @xmath13    where @xmath14 is a cranked single - particle nilsson hamiltonian including the pairing field .",
    "the quadrupole deformation and pairing gaps are determined by the standard strutinsky procedure at @xmath15 . we have adopted the phenomenological prescription given in ref.@xcite for the pairing gaps at finite frequency ( which is characterized by a `` critical '' frequency @xmath16 ) .",
    "the residual interactions are separable multipole interactions , @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a residual pairing interaction consistent with the mean field and @xmath19 are multipole operators defined in doubly - stretched coordinates @xmath20 ( @xmath21)@xcite . the coupling strengths of the interactions @xmath22 are determined in the same way as in nmms .",
    "however , since we do not know exactly the selfconsistent interactions in a realistic nilsson potential , we have done the calculations with two different values of the octupole coupling strengths ; the `` harmonic - oscillator '' value ( @xmath23)@xcite and the one increased by 5% ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we use this symbol @xmath25 as a scaling factor of the coupling strengths . see eq.(3.13 ) in nmms .",
    "after diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with the rpa theory , it is written as @xmath26    for even - even nuclei at finite rotational frequency .",
    "here @xmath27 ( = 0,1 ) indicates the signature quantum number . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the n - th rpa - normal - mode creation operator and its excitation energy , respectively .",
    "since we take the yrast sd band as the rpa vacuum , @xmath29 gives the routhian ( excitation energy in the rotating frame ) relative to the yrast sd band .    from the rpa eigenenergies , we calculate the @xmath1 moments of inertia for excited sd bands as follows ( see nmms for detail ) : the relative difference between the excited and yrast bands",
    "is given by @xmath30 , and added to the experimental @xmath31 of the yrast band , @xmath32 .",
    "this procedure allows us to take into account the complex correlations which are implicitly included in @xmath31 ; e.g. , the pairing fluctuation , the higher - order pairing .    in the rpa theory ,",
    "excited states @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are described by superposition of 2qp  excitations , @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the rpa vacuum and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are the rpa forward ( backward ) amplitudes .",
    "the backward amplitudes are generally smaller than the forward amplitudes if the mean field is stable enough .",
    "a non - collective state has a single dominant 2qp   component , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "a collective state may be characterized by the coherent contributions from many different 2qp  components and substantial contributions from backward amplitudes .    as is discussed in sec.[sec : general ] , the lowest @xmath9 neutron quasiparticles change @xmath1 moments of inertia most significantly .",
    "therefore , the observed excited bands in even - even nuclei , which show the @xmath1 identical to those of the yrast @xmath31 , can not be the lowest 2qp  states associated with these orbitals . a possible explanation for this similarity of @xmath1 is interpreting them as 2qp  excitations invoking high-@xmath42 orbitals .",
    "for instance , bands 2 and 3 in @xmath43hg  have been originally assigned as two - quasineutron excitations [ 624 9/2]@xmath44[512 5/2]@xcite . however , this does not explain why we have not observed 2qp   excitations associated with the neutron @xmath9 orbitals which should be lower in energy at high frequency ( see discussion in sec.[sec : general ] ) .    instead , we presume those excited bands could be the collective states . first of all , the excitation energies of collective states may be lower than any 2qp  state .",
    "in addition , some collective bands may produce the @xmath45 ( which means @xmath46 ) because of the spreading of the rpa amplitudes over many 2qp s . in a highly collective state ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath47 of each 2qp  component is small and the peculiar effect of the neutron @xmath9 orbitals can be _ smeared _ by the other components .",
    "this `` smearing '' has been actually demonstrated for @xmath43hg  in nmms , and will be also done for pb isotopes in sec .",
    "[ sec : pb ] .",
    "in this section , results of the rpa calculations are presented for the excited states in sd hg nuclei .",
    "since we have already published this result in nmms , here we briefly review the main results of nmms and discuss new experimental data on @xmath43hg .",
    "the main conclusions of nmms are summarized as follows .    1 .   the @xmath0 octupole vibrations are the lowest excitation modes ( @xmath48 mev , b(@xmath49 s.p.u . ) in these hg isotopes at @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 vibrations are higher in energy and less collective ( @xmath52 mev , b(@xmath53 s.p.u . ) than the lowest octupole vibrations at @xmath50 .",
    "3 .   in @xmath54hg , two observed excited sd bands , bands 2 and 4 , are assigned to the lowest octupole bands with signature @xmath55 and 0 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath55 octupole vibration is rotationally aligned , while the @xmath56 is crossed by a two - quasineutron band at high frequency .",
    "4 .   in @xmath57hg",
    ", bands 2 and 3 are assigned to the lowest ( @xmath0 ) octupole bands with signature @xmath55 and 0 , respectively .",
    "both bands are crossed by a two - quasineutron band at high frequency .",
    "5 .   in @xmath43hg",
    ", bands 2 and 3 are assigned to the lowest ( @xmath0 ) octupole bands with signature @xmath56 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the strongest mixture of low-@xmath42 components ( @xmath58 and 1 ) at finite frequency is predicted for band 2 of @xmath54hg , which explains why strong dipole decay into the yrast sd band has been observed only for this band .    for @xmath43hg",
    ", recent gammasphere experiments have revealed the excitation energies and spins of the yrast@xcite and excited ( band 3 ) sd bands@xcite .",
    "the experimental routhians of band 3 relative to the yrast sd band have been extracted from these experimental data@xcite .",
    "the experiments indicate that band 3 is very low - lying , @xmath59 mev at @xmath15 , which seems to support our interpretation of collective vibrations because the lowest 2qp  states have been predicted to be at @xmath60 mev in nmms .    in fig .",
    "[ one ] we compare the experimental routhians with the theoretical results presented in nmms and ref.@xcite ( indicated by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively ) and with routhians calculated with slightly different parameters ( indicated by ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the parameter sets used for the calculations are ; ( 1 ) the same parameters as in nmms ( dynamically reduced pairing and @xmath23 ) , ( 2 ) the same as in ref.@xcite ( constant pairing gaps and @xmath24 ) , and ( 3 ) the same as ( 1 ) except @xmath61 and @xmath62 mev for protons ( see eq.(3.4 ) in nmms ) .",
    "it turns out that the previous calculation ( 2 ) had predicted the experimental routhians very nicely , while the calculation ( 1 ) had overestimated the excitation energy by about @xmath63 kev .",
    "the parameters ( 3 ) are chosen to reproduce the experiments : it seems to suggest that the reduction of proton pairing is smaller than expected in nmms and the optimal octupole coupling strengths are slightly larger than the harmonic - oscillator values .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion in nmms in which we have shown the slightly larger coupling strengths ( @xmath24 ) reproduce the experimental @xmath1 even better .",
    "experimental information has also been obtained on the signature splitting of bands 2 and 3 ( assuming they are signature partners ) .",
    "this is discussed in a paper by f.  stephens in this proceedings@xcite .",
    "again , the agreement becomes better for the result with the slower pairing reduction and the larger octupole coupling .",
    "= 0.67    =       2",
    "in this section , the results are presented for excited states in sd even - even pb nuclei . in @xmath64pb ,",
    "the predicted properties of @xmath51 vibrations are similar to those in hg nuclei ( see the previous section and nmms ) ; the excitation energy ( @xmath65 mev ) is higher than the lowest octupole state and their weak collectivity will be dissipated at high spin .",
    "therefore , the observation of the @xmath51 vibration is expected to be more difficult than the octupole vibrations .",
    "hereafter , let us focus our discussion on the collective octupole excitations .",
    "figure  [ two ] shows the calculated routhians with negative parity relative to the yrast sd bands for even - even pb nuclei .",
    "the quadrupole deformation @xmath66 , the pairing parameters @xmath67 ( 0.7 ) mev with @xmath68 ( 0.5 ) mev for neutrons ( protons ) , and @xmath24 are used throughout ( cf .",
    "sec.iii-a in nmms ) .",
    "the lowest states are again the @xmath0 octupole vibrations for all nuclei .",
    "the excited sd bands in even - even pb nuclei have been observed in @xmath43pb  ( bands 2 and 3)@xcite and @xmath69pb   ( bands 2 , 3 , and 4)@xcite .",
    "we assume the lowest octupole bands ( @xmath56 and 1 ) correspond to the observed excited bands ( bands 2 and 3 ) in @xmath43pb  and @xmath69pb .",
    "unfortunately we could not give unique assignment to band 4 in @xmath69pb  ( see below ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath1 moments of inertia are shown in fig .",
    "[ three](a ) together with the experimental data .",
    "the signature of excited bands is determined by following the experimental suggestions@xcite . as is discussed in sec.[sec :",
    "theory ] , the @xmath1 identical to those of the yrast sd band are reproduced by means of the `` smearing '' effect .",
    "the results calculated with @xmath24 agree with the experiments especially well .",
    "there is an experimental suggestion that    =    the band - head energy of bands 2 and 3 in @xmath69pb  is around 870 kev@xcite , which again indicates better agreement with the results with @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ two ] ) .    in order to clarify how the `` smearing '' works , we show examples of rpa amplitudes calculated with @xmath24 for the lowest @xmath55 octupole state in @xmath69pb : at @xmath15 , the largest component is a two - quasineutron @xmath70 ( occupying @xmath71 and @xmath72 orbitals ) with @xmath73 , while it will be a two - quasiproton @xmath74 with @xmath75 at @xmath76 mev . as you can see , even the largest component occupies less than 10% of the total sum of forward amplitudes @xmath77 . as is discussed before",
    ", the neutron @xmath9 orbitals give the most significant effect on @xmath1 moments of inertia .",
    "the largest component associated with neutron @xmath9 is @xmath78 ( 0.02 ) at @xmath79 ( 0.3 ) mev .",
    "therefore , the blocking of @xmath9 orbitals turns out to be extremely weak in this collective excitation , which results in the @xmath1 almost identical to those of the yrast band .",
    "the experiment@xcite has also observed decay transitions from excited sd bands ( bands 2 , 3 , and 4 ) into the yrast sd band in @xmath69pb   ( the dipole character of decays from band 3 was confirmed ) . assuming the @xmath80 transitions , the experimental b(@xmath80 ) values",
    "have been extracted from the branching ratio ; b(@xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 w.u . for bands 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively . using the @xmath80 recoil charge ( @xmath84 for neutrons and @xmath85 for protons ) ,",
    "the calculations with @xmath24 at @xmath76 mev have suggested b(@xmath86 , @xmath87 w.u . for bands 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "if we assume band 4 is an either @xmath58 or 1 octupole band , the b(@xmath88 would be about @xmath82 w.u .",
    "although the calculation underestimates the absolute magnitude by a factor of 10 , the relative difference among bands 2 , 3 , and 4 is well reproduced .",
    "however , the band - head energies of @xmath58 and 1 octupole states are predicted to be around 1.5 mev which is much higher than the experimental suggestion ( @xmath89 mev ) ; this weakens our interpretation of band 4 as an octupole state .",
    "note that , since we could not make the reliable prediction about @xmath90 vibrations , we can not deny a possibility that band 4 is a @xmath90 vibration .",
    "besides , if the transitions from band 4 are @xmath91 , it could be a 2qp  band , because the @xmath1 moments of this band show the atypical behavior which might suggest effects of the neutron @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "figure  [ three](b ) shows the @xmath92 amplitudes ( @xmath58 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) of the lowest octupole states as functions of frequency .",
    "the @xmath42-mixing turns out to be weak for both bands 2 and 3 in @xmath69pb .",
    "since the @xmath80 strength is supposed to be carried by the low-@xmath42 component ( @xmath58 and 1 ) , it provides the small b(@xmath80 ) for bands 2 and 3 ( @xmath93 w.u . ) .",
    "the calculation suggests the relatively strong coriolis mixing for @xmath94 octupole band in @xmath43pb .",
    "this leads to b(@xmath95 w.u . which is the largest among the octupole states shown in fig .",
    "[ three ] .",
    "further experimental investigation about the linking transitions between excited and yrast sd bands in @xmath43pb   may clarify the octupole collectivity of this band .",
    "although the excited sd bands in even - even a=190 nuclei have been observed so far only in @xmath2hg and @xmath97pb , we expect this will be significantly extended in near future by means of the new generation @xmath51-ray detectors . among those candidates , @xmath57pb  and @xmath96pb  may be relatively easy to access because the yrast sd bands have been already observed . in this section",
    ", we make a prediction on the properties of octupole bands in these nuclei .",
    "the octupole states in @xmath57pb  are similar to those ( bands 2 and 4 ) in @xmath54hg ; the lowest octupole phonon with signature @xmath55 is rotationally aligned , and the second lowest with @xmath56 is crossed by a 2qp  band ( fig .  [ two ] ) . in fig .  [ four ] , we show the calculated @xmath1 moments of inertia for the lowest octupole bands in each signature sector .",
    "the @xmath55 band shows the large and almost constant @xmath1 , while the @xmath56 shows a bump at frequency @xmath98 mev ( if we take @xmath23 , the position of this bump will be shifted to @xmath99 mev ) .",
    "since the aligned octupole phonon is a result of strong coriolis mixing , the @xmath55 band has substantial amounts of @xmath58 and 1 components at finite frequency , which will lead to the relatively strong @xmath80 decays into the yrast sd band ( b(@xmath100 w.u . ) .    in @xmath96pb , the lowest @xmath0 octupole states ( @xmath56 and 1 )",
    "are predicted to have no signature splitting .",
    "their @xmath1 moments of inertia are identical to each other and similar to those of the yrast sd band ( fig .",
    "[ four ] ) . in this case , since the coriolis mixing is very weak , the @xmath80 strengths are predicted to be small ( b(@xmath101 w.u . ) .",
    "the microscopic structure of the @xmath51 and the octupole vibrations built on the sd yrast bands in @xmath2hg and @xmath64pb were investigated by means of the rpa based on the cranked shell model .",
    "for all these even - even nuclei , the @xmath0 octupole vibrations are predicted to be the lowest .    new experimental data on sd @xmath43hg@xcite",
    "seem to support our interpretation in nmms that bands 2 and 3 may be @xmath0 octupole vibrational states .",
    "the results in ref.@xcite calculated with slightly different parameters agreed better with the experimental routhians for band 3 , which may suggest the pairing reduction at finite frequency should be smaller and the optimal octupole coupling strengths be larger than the ones used in nmms .         as mentioned above ,",
    "the @xmath0 octupole vibrations are predicted to be the lowest in the region where the sd bands have been observed so far ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) .",
    "since the @xmath80 strengths only come from the coriolis mixing of the @xmath58 and 1 components , the most direct evidence of octupole correlations , namely the strong decays into the yrast sd band , have been observed in limited cases ( band 2 in @xmath54hg  and band 4 in @xmath69pb ) .",
    "however , if future experiments extend this region into @xmath104 or @xmath105 , the @xmath106 octupole vibrations are predicted to become the lowest ( or close to the lowest ) .",
    "then , strong @xmath80 decay should be observed , and would be good experimental evidence for octupole collectivity .",
    "this lowering of @xmath106 octupole states at open shell configurations is a result of the striking shell structure at superdeformation and has been discussed in ref.@xcite .    from these calculations and from a comparison with available experiments",
    ", we would like to conclude that the octupole vibrations are prevalently observed in even - even sd a=190 nuclei ( `` _ octupole paradise _ '' ) .",
    "the observation of the high - spin collective excitations is very difficult in nd nuclei , because the energy gaps at the fermi surface quickly disappear due to many aligned 2qp  states , so that non - collective modes of excitation become dominant at high spin .",
    "the large deformation and large shell gap in sd nuclei may overcome this situation and provide us with a valuable opportunity to observe a variety of collective excitations in rapidly rotating quantum systems .",
