    "the statistical properties of granular gases have been intensively studied in recent time , in particular with respect to cluster formation process , e.g. @xcite and other structure formation , e.g. @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we are concerned with dynamical processes in granular gases which precede clustering , i.e. in the homogeneously cooling state ( hcs ) . in difference to the state when particles form clusters and other long range structures , in the hcs ( due to its definition ) one may drop the explicit spatial dependence of the statistical properties , which simplifies an application of standard methods of the gas kinetic gas theory .",
    "granular gases in the hcs were intensively investigated recently ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) focusing on the velocity distribution function which is one of the most important characteristics of the system of granular particles . it has been argued that the distribution function might deviate from the maxwellian  @xcite , and this deviation has been also quantified  @xcite .    in all of these studies a constant restitution coefficient , characterizing the energy loss due to a particle collision was assumed .",
    "the restitution coefficient relates the velocities of the colliding particles before a collision @xmath0 , @xmath1 to the velocities after the collision @xmath2 , @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the relative velocity and the unit vector @xmath6 gives the direction of the inter - center vector @xmath7 at the instant of the collision . strictly speaking the restitution coefficient @xmath8 as introduced in eq .",
    "( [ directcoll ] ) describes the collision of _ smooth _ inelastic particles , when only the normal component @xmath9 of the relative velocity @xmath10 changes .",
    "therefore , it is termed as _ normal _ restitution coefficient . using the tangential restitution coefficient @xcite",
    ", one can account for the change of tangential component of the relative velocity at the collision of rough inelastic particles . in what follows",
    "we assume that the particles are smooth and the dynamics of a collision is completely described by the change of the normal component of the relative velocity .",
    "experiments , as well as theoretical studies show , however , that @xmath8 noticeably depends on the impact velocity @xmath10 @xcite ; even a dimension analysis shows that the assumption of the constant restitution coefficient contradicts physical reality @xcite .",
    "this dependence may cause rather important consequences for various problems in granular gas dynamics @xcite .",
    "the problem of the restitution coefficient s dependence on the impact velocity has been addressed in @xcite , where the generalization of the hertz contact problem was developed for the collision of viscoelastic particles ( scaling analysis of this dependence has been also addressed in @xcite ) .",
    "the generalized hertz collision equation derived in @xcite has been solved analytically to obtain the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the young modulus , @xmath14 is the poisson ratio , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are radii and masses of colliding particles ) , @xmath19 is the dissipative constant , which depends on the material parameters ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "numerical values for the constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 obtained in @xcite may be also written in a more convenient form @xcite : @xmath22",
    "although the next - order coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 , are now available @xcite , we assume that the dissipative constant @xmath19 is small enough to ignore these high - order terms .",

    "[ sec : kinetic ] we analyze the boltzmann equation for the granular gas with the velocity- dependent @xmath8 in the hcs and calculate the first few coefficients of the sonine polynomials expansion .",

    "we summarize our findings",
    ". some technical detail of the calculations are given in the appendixes .",
    "for granular gases where the particles interact via a restitution coefficient @xmath25 it was argued that the velocity distribution @xmath26 has the scaling form , i.e. that its time - dependence may be written as ( here we follow notations of ref.@xcite ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number density of the granular gas , @xmath29 is the thermal velocity , defined in terms of the temperature of the granular gas @xmath30 @xmath31 is the mass of the granular particles , and @xmath32 is the dimension . the temperature is related to the second moment of the velocity distribution in the same way as for equilibrium molecular systems : @xmath33    then the expansion of the scaling function @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 ) in terms of the sonine polynomials reads @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the maxwellian distribution for the rescaled velocity .",
    "the sonine polynomials @xmath38 satisfy the orthogonality conditions @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the kronecker delta and with the normalization constant @xmath41 @xcite . for dimension",
    "@xmath42 which is addressed here the first few sonine polynomials read @xmath43 the coefficients @xmath44 of the expansion may be found as the polynomial moments of the function @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath45 the coefficients @xmath44 do not depend on time for a _ constant _ restitution coefficient @xcite .",
    "these were first applied for the granular gas in ref.@xcite and then recalculated recently @xcite :    @xmath46    the first relation ( [ sonina1a2 ] ) follows from the definition of the temperature of the granular gas ( this we explain in more detail below ) , while eq .",
    "( [ sonina1a2a ] ) has been obtained within the linear approximation with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "complete analysis , which goes beyond the linear approximation , has been performed @xcite , and it has been shown @xcite that the linear solution ( [ sonina1a2a ] ) is rather accurate for the whole range of @xmath8 with a maximal deviation from a total one less than @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "all the higher - order coefficients were neglected under assumption of small deviations from the maxwellian distribution .",
    "since @xmath49 do not depend on time , the scaling form of the velocity distribution function ( [ veldis ] ) persists with time for the case of @xmath50 .",
    "since the average velocity of a granular gas decreases due to permanently decreasing temperature , the `` typical '' restitution coefficient will increase with time as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ epsc1c2 ] ) .",
    "thus one can expect that the coefficients of the sonine polynomials expansion , which depend on the restitution coefficient ( see e.g. ( [ sonina1a2a ] ) ) should also change with time .",
    "this conclusion , however , contradicts the assumption , that the scaling function ( [ soninexp ] ) does not depend on time and implies that the common scheme of calculation of the sonine polynomials expansion coefficients breaks down if @xmath8 is not a constant . for for the latter case , one needs to develop a more general approach .",
    "we start from the enskog - boltzmann equation for the distribution function @xmath51 for a granular gas of inelastic spheres which in the force - free case does not depend on @xmath52 , hence , one can write @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the diameter of the particles . the contact value of the two - particle correlation function , @xmath55 @xcite ( with @xmath56 being the packing fraction ) accounts for the increasing collision frequency due to the excluded volume effects .",
    "@xmath57 is the heaviside step - function .",
    "the velocities @xmath58 and @xmath59 refer to the pre - collisional velocities of the so - called inverse collision , which results with @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the after - collisional velocities ( the relation between these velocities are similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ directcoll ] ) , but with the impact - velocity dependent restitution coefficient , see appendix a ) .",
    "finally the factor @xmath60 in the gain term appears respectively from the jacobian of the transformation @xmath61 and from the relation between the lengths of the collisional cylinders @xmath62 ( see appendix a for details ) . for the constant restitution coefficient @xmath63    some important properties of the collisional integral hold also for the case of the impact - velocity dependent restitution coefficient .",
    "namely , it may be shown that the relation    @xmath64 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    2 holds true , where @xmath65 is the average of some function @xmath66 , and @xmath67 $ ] denotes change of @xmath68 in a direct collision .",
    "now we analyze the scaling ansatz ( [ veldis ] ) for the velocity distribution function . using this ansatz and performing calculations similar to that in ref.@xcite",
    ", one would find corresponding expressions for the coefficients @xmath44 of the sonine polynomial expansion . these would occur to be time - dependent due to permanently decreasing average velocity of the cooling gas and thus permanently increasing effective value of the restitution coefficient .",
    "this however means that the simple scaling ( [ veldis ] ) for the velocity distribution function does not hold for the case of interest .",
    "technically , as we show below , this follows from the additional time - dependence of the factor @xmath69 in the collisional integral , which does not depend on time for @xmath50 .",
    "thus , it seems natural to write the three dimensional distribution function in the general form @xmath70 with @xmath71 and find then equations for the _ time - dependent _ coefficients @xmath72 .    substituting ( [ genscal ] ) into the boltzmann equation ( [ collint ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath73 where we define the dimensionless collisional integral @xmath74 the reduced factor @xmath75 @xmath76 depends now on time via a quantity @xmath77^{1/10 }   \\equiv \\delta \\left[2t(t)/t_0 \\right]^{1/10 } \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the initial temperature , and for simplicity we assume the particles to be of unit mass , @xmath80 .",
    "the rate of change of the thermal velocity @xmath81 in ( [ boltzred ] ) may be expressed in terms of the temperature decay rate @xmath82 , which reads according to the definitions ( [ deftemp],[deftemp1 ] ) and relation ( [ deraver ] ) for the time derivatives of averages @xmath83 we define here @xmath84 and introduce the moments of the dimensionless collision integral : @xmath85 with this notations we recast ( [ boltzred ] ) into the form : @xmath86 note that contrary to the case of @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , the factor @xmath69 depends now on time , which does not allow to write the collision integral in terms of only scaling variables .",
    "this implies time dependence of all the moments @xmath89 ( which were time - independent for constant restitution coefficient ) and correspondingly causes time dependence of the sonine polynonomials expansion coefficients @xmath44 .    multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ geneqveldis ] ) with @xmath90 and integrating over @xmath91 we obtain : @xmath92 where integration by parts has been performed and where we define @xmath93 and @xmath94 the calculation of the @xmath95 is straightforward ; the first few of them read : @xmath96 the odd moments @xmath97 are zero , while the even ones , @xmath98 , may be expressed in terms of @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath101 may be written as a sum of sonine polynomials @xmath102 with @xmath100 and from the orthogonality condition ( [ soninortog ] ) .",
    "namely , using @xmath103 together with the expansion ( [ gensoninexp ] ) and condition ( [ soninortog ] ) , one easily finds @xmath104 \\left\\ { \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } a_k s_k(c^2 ) \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac32 - \\frac32 a_1   \\label{c2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath105 and where we use the normalization constant @xmath106 [ see eq .",
    "( [ soninortog ] ) ] . from the definitions of temperature and of the thermal velocity ( [ deftemp ] ) , ( [ deftemp1 ] ) follows that @xmath107 ( see also ( [ cpdef ] ) )",

    "it is not possible to get a general solution to the problem .",
    "however , since the dissipative parameter @xmath111 is supposed to be small , the deviations from the maxwellian distribution are not presumably large .",
    "thus we assume , that one can neglect all the high - order terms in the expansion ( [ gensoninexp ] ) with @xmath112 .",
