    "<S> the reflectivity properties of graphene with nonzero mass - gap parameter are investigated in the framework of dirac model using the polarization tensor in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time . for this purpose , a more simple explicit representation for the polarization tensor along the real frequency axis </S>",
    "<S> is found . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate analytic expressions for the polarization tensor and for the reflectivities of graphene are obtained in different frequency regions at any temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the nonzero mass - gap parameter has a profound effect on the reflectivity of graphene . specifically , at zero temperature the reflectivity of gapped graphene goes to zero with vanishing frequency . at nonzero temperature </S>",
    "<S> the same reflectivities are equal to unity at zero frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the resonance behavior of the reflectivities of gapped graphene at both zero and nonzero temperature at the border frequency determined by the width of the gap . at nonzero temperature the reflectifities of graphene drop to zero in the vicinity of some frequency smaller than the border frequency . </S>",
    "<S> our analytic results are accompanied with numerical computations performed over a wide frequency region . </S>",
    "<S> the developed formalism can be used in devising nanoscale optical detectors , optoelectronic switches and in other optical applications of graphene . </S>"
