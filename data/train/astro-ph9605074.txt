    "in one of his early seminal papers , larson ( 1974 ) postulated that the mass - metallicity relation observed in the present - day elliptical galaxy population ( @xcite ) was a natural consequence of supernovae ( sne)-driven galactic winds . with each sn contributing @xmath1 erg of thermal energy to a galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism )",
    ", larson demonstrated that standard star formation rate scenarios would inevitably result in the expulsion of any remaining gas once its accumulated thermal energy exceeded that of its gravitational binding energy .",
    "the bulk of subsequent star formation would then be suppressed ( at this time @xmath2 ) , thereby `` freezing '' in the chemical imprints which would be observable today in the stellar populations .",
    "because of a larger binding energy per unit mass , @xmath2 would occur later in more massive systems , thereby allowing the enrichment process to progress further than in more massive systems , in rough accordance with the observed mass - metallicity relation .",
    "the elegant simplicity of larson s ( 1974 ) model was immediately recognized and provided the basis for a generation of elliptical galaxy sne - driven wind models .",
    "the primary motivation behind the majority of subsequent studies has been to better understand the chemical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and dynamical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) evolution of these systems . related to this has been the particular attention paid to the role played by cluster ellipticals in polluting the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters with metals via large scale super - winds ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "transcending from the mass - metallicity plane , to a more convenient observational colour - metallicity - luminosity ( cml ) space , requires the parallel computation of a system s photometric evolution .",
    "this is an important step to take , as the photometric properties of galaxies should be a primary constraint in any galactic evolution code . until recently ,",
    "though , this has been a difficult prospect , owing to the dearth of available self - consistent , metallicity - sensitive stellar evolution tracks and photometric calibrations .",
    "this has been alleviated somewhat with the release of the kurucz ( 1993 ) grid of model atmospheres .",
    "their subsequent use , in particular by worthey ( 1994 ) and bertelli ( 1994 ) , in constructing extensive grids of isochrones has made the coupled photo - chemical evolution of ellipticals , within the sne - driven wind framework , a realistic aim .",
    "indeed , during the past few years , several groups have begun investigations in just this direction ",
    "bressan ( 1994 ) ( bcf94 , hereafter ) and gibson ( 1996b ) ( g96 , hereafter ) are the first of the new generation of sne - driven wind codes to take advantage of the coupled photometric and chemical evolution possibilities .",
    "a precursor , in the same vein as these two more recent codes , belongs to arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) ( ay87 , hereafter ) .",
    "their efforts in piecing together , from innumerable sources , a grid of stellar evolution tracks and photo - chemical calibrations , was nothing less than heroic .",
    "in the course of testing our own code , it has become apparent that for all the similarities in their goals ( replicating the present - day cml relations , primarily ) and approaches ( classic sne - driven wind model of @xcite ) , there are more than a few subtle , and `` hidden '' , differences in the above three packages which have not been fully appreciated . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to bring to light , in as straightforward a manner as possible , some of these hidden differences .",
    "considering the proliferation of such models , we feel it imperative ( and long overdue ) that such a presentation be undertaken .    in section [ g96 ] , we briefly describe a simple template model with which to work , drawing attention to each of the intrinsic input ingredients ( supernova remnant ( snr ) ism thermal energy deposition efficiency , nucleosynthetic yields , initial mass function ( imf ) ) .",
    "the template chosen is from g96 , and successfully reproduces the present - day photo - chemical properties .",
    "we then systematically explore the influence of varying each of the primary input ingredients , in accordance with those chosen by ay87 and bcf94 .",
    "this is done in sections [ ay87 ] and [ bcf94 ] , respectively .",
    "this is an important exercise which has never been carried out before , and serves to illustrate exactly how the different groups were able to piece together seemingly incompatible ingredients and yet , apparently , recover the proper present - day observable photo - chemical properties .",
    "a summary is provided in section [ summary ] .",
    "let us re - iterate once again that the general framework adopted by the three groups ",
    "ay87 , bcf94 , and g96  is quite similar . specifically , elliptical proto - galaxies are taken to be initially homogeneous gas spheres , and the chemical evolution proceeds according to the simple closed - box model .",
    "each avoids the instantaneous recycling approximation , but subscribes to the instantaneous mixing approximation .",
    "the global thermal energy budget of the ism is assumed to follow the basic prescription outlined in saito ( 1979b ) and global ejection of said ism is taken to occur at @xmath2 ( the point at which the thermal energy exceeds the gravitational binding energy ) .",
    "each of the groups claim reproducibility of the fundamental cml relations for ellipticals .",
    "this is a most interesting result given the very different assumptions regarding star formation rate efficiencies , dark matter distributions , sne progenitor assumptions , nuclesynthesis , imf , sne thermal energy deposition to the ism efficiency , etc .",
    "the combination of all these differences manifests itself in very different predictions for @xmath2 .",
    "ay87 and bcf94 represent the extremes in this apparent dichotomy ; for massive ellipticals , the former prefer the late - time galactic wind ( @xmath3 gyr ) , whereas the latter prefer a much earlier time - scale ( @xmath4 gyr ) . on the surface",
    ", these results would appear incompatible , particularly when one considers that star formation is presumed to occur only for @xmath5 .",
    "that both groups can claim their final models match the observations , when one s star formation is an order of magnitude longer in duration , is puzzling , and it is important to be aware of exactly how this comes about in order to appreciate the claims of all the groups in question .    to anticipate what follows ,",
    "let us look at one massive elliptical scenario : for an initial gas mass @xmath6 m@xmath7 and salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , g96 predict @xmath8 gyr , whereas for the same imf slope , bcf94 find @xmath9 gyr . both the final colours ( v - k@xmath103.35 ) and metallicity ( @xmath11_{\\rm v}\\approx + 0.45 $ ] ) match the observations . on the other hand , for a flatter imf ( power - law slope , by mass , of @xmath12 )",
    ", g96 found @xmath13 gyr , whereas for the same slope , ay87 found @xmath14 gyr .",
    "again , both the colours and metallicities were consistent with those just mentioned .",
    "one is left with the question  _ what are the driving factors which lead to very different results for @xmath2 , and yet still allow each group to claim reproducibility of the present - day observational constraints ? _    at some level , this is difficult to answer as there is a tendency to not report each and every assumption regarding the various input ingredients .",
    "as such , we do not wish to belabour the issue by minutely examining every parameter of these codes , but we do feel it important to highlight some of the primary differences which lead to the , at times , very different results .      our working template , as described in detail in gibson ( 1995,1996b ) ,",
    "was generated using the time- and metallicity - independent salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , with lower and upper mass limits of @xmath15 m@xmath7 and @xmath16 m@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the metallicity - dependent yields of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) were used for type ii sne .",
    "the global thermal evolution of the ism was governed by knowledge of the type ia and ii sne rates as a function of time , coupled with the thermal energy made available to the ism by each sn , as a function of time .",
    "the model for the latter assumes that individual snrs halt their expansion once coming into pressure equilibrium with the ambient ism , but continue to cool radiatively _ ad infinitum .",
    "this form is denoted model b@xmath17 in gibson s ( 1994b ) notation and is taken directly from cioffi ( 1988 ) .",
    "diffuse dark matter halos with mass and radial extent ratios relative to the luminous component of ten were used , following the formalism of bertin ( 1992 ) .",
    "3% of the mass in the imf in the mass range @xmath18 m@xmath7 was assumed to be locked into type ia - progenitor binary systems ( @xcite ) , an _ a posteriori choice which ensured a present - day type ia sn rate in agreement with turatto ( 1994 ) km / s / mpc assumed throughout . ] .",
    "star formation was assumed to proceed in lockstep with the available gas mass , the proportionality constant linking the two , @xmath19 , simply being the inverse of the time scale for star formation .",
    "the chemical evolution is similar in spirit to that of matteucci & greggio ( 1986 ) , although we have adopted a more intuitively obvious `` mass in / mass out '' formalism ( timmes 1995 ) , as opposed to the talbot & arnett ( 1971 ) `` matrix '' formalism .",
    "the photometric evolution was coupled to the chemical evolution , as outlined in gibson ( 1996a ) .",
    "in general , the metallicity - dependent isochrones of worthey ( 1994 ) were adopted , although when those of bertelli ( 1994 ) were used , the distinction is made .",

    "this is simply an artifact of the two codes temporal resolutions ; in the vicinity of @xmath2 , matteucci & padovani use @xmath29 myr , whereas our curves were generated with a uniform @xmath30 myr .",
    "the two codes are entirely consistent when identical @xmath31 values are assumed . ] with that shown in figure 1 of matteucci & padovani ( 1993 ) .",
    "recall that star formation in this model ceases at @xmath8 gyr .",
    "one can see that it only takes @xmath32 gyr for any one of the elements to reach their approximate solar abundance ( within a factor of @xmath33 ) .",
    "note that each of the elements undergoes a post-@xmath2 dilution due to the continually increasing gas mass ( from dying low mass stars ) .",
    "the one element which is immune to this dilution is iron  the enormous quantity of fe ejected per sne ia event ( @xmath34 m@xmath7  thielemann 1993 ) is enough to counteract said dilution .",
    "carbon declines slightly slower than the other elements ( besides iron , of course ) after @xmath2 due to the increased importance of the carbon - producing single low and intermediate mass stars ( @xcite ) . as the type ii yields used for this model ( @xcite ) did not have any primary nitrogen production , it is not until the @xmath35 m@xmath7 stars with primary n ( the @xcite models with hot bottom burning included ) start dying that [ n ] starts increasing",
    "this is reason why the [ n ] curve takes @xmath36 myr to approach that of the others .",

    "let us now step through , one - by - one , the sources and implications of the discrepancy . as a starting point , we use the g96 prediction , given by the final entry to table [ tbl : templatemodels2 ] :    * _ star formation efficiency : _ for the @xmath37 m@xmath7 model , ay87 required @xmath38 gyr@xmath39 to recover the proper present - day photo - chemical properties , whereas we needed @xmath40 gyr@xmath39 .",

    "* _ type ia sne : _",
    "ay87 neglect type ia sne entirely .",
    "this immediately eliminated one potential observational constraint from their modeling ( the magnesium overabundances relative to iron ",
    "worthey 1992 ) , as this all - important iron source was not included .",
    "on the other hand , this is not particularly important for @xmath2 ; when using their flat imf to run the previous model , but this time with type ia sne `` switched off '' , @xmath2 only increases to 1.43 gyr . * _ yields : _",
    "ay87 use the older arnett ( 1978 ) yields , although the exact implementation is unclear ( in particular , for z@xmath41z@xmath7 ) .",
    "still , replacing the woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) yields with those of arnett ( 1991 ) ( which are reasonably similar to his older 1978 yields , as far as global z is concerned ) , led to a mild increase in @xmath2 to 1.51 gyr .",
    "this comes about because the snr thermal energy evolution model b@xmath17 is mildly metallicity - dependent at late - times ( @xmath42z / z@xmath43  cioffi 1988 ) , and for the same @xmath19 , the arnett ( 1991 ) yields lead to a slightly more enriched gas , in comparison with the woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) yields ( gibson 1995,1996b ) .",
    "the more enriched gas leads to increased cooling , which decreases the effective energy contribution per sn , and thus increases @xmath2 .. * _ dark matter : _",
    "ay87 do not include any dark matter component .",
    "eliminating this reduces @xmath2 from the previous 1.51 gyr , to 1.25 gyr , due to the slight reduction in the depth of the potential well . *",
    "_ ism binding energy : _ ignoring dark matter , ay87 used the gaseous binding energy formalism of saito ( 1979b ) , as opposed to that of bertin ( 1992 ) , which was used by g96 and bcf94 .",
    "this older form , in the absence of dark matter , predicts higher binding energies for the same residual ism gas mass . using saito s ( 1979a ) form in lieu of bertin s ( 1992 ) ,",
    "leads to an increase in @xmath2 from the previous 1.25 gyr , to 2.06 gyr . *",
    "_ sne thermal energy evolution : _",
    "ay87 use what we ( @xcite ) call model a@xmath44 , which is simply the classic snr energetics form due to cox ( 1972 ) and chevalier ( 1974 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "g96 use the aforementioned model b@xmath17 , based upon cioffi ( 1988 ) .",
    "switching to a@xmath44 reduces @xmath2 to 1.82 gyr .",

    "_ hydrogen number density - further sne energetics : _",
    "ay87 assumed that the hydrogen number density @xmath45 was constant throughout time , and given by @xmath46 .",
    "this overestimates @xmath45 for @xmath47 , which in turn , depletes the available energy per sn event which is made available to the ism for powering a galactic wind , because of the @xmath48 dependence in the late - time snr interior thermal energy evolution ( @xcite ) . adopting their invalid assumption results in a large increase in @xmath0 , from 2.18 gyr , to 10.52 gyr .",
    "such a late wind epoch seems highly unlikely , as , under the current formalism , the implied star formation rates for ellipticals in the redshift range @xmath49 would be @xmath50 m@xmath7/yr , inconsistent with the observed rates ( @xcite ) .",

    "this has the advantage of tying up much more mass in ultra - low mass ( long - lived ) objects , thereby reducing the gaseous binding energy at later times , despite the corresponding reduction in the absolute type ii sne production .",

    "_ type ii sne : _ to partially compensate for the lack of type ia sne in their modelling , ay87 arbitrarily adopt a lower limit for type ii sne progenitors of 3.0 m@xmath7 .",

    "_ proto - galactic radius : _ in g96 , as in most other galactic wind codes , the radius of the pre - wind proto - galaxy is taken to be approximately that of the present - day spheroids . at some level",
    "this is probably incorrect ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; elbaz 1995 ) , but for lack of better observational constraints on proto - galactic sizes at the onset of star formation , this seems the most conservative approach . in the published ay87 paper , this also appears to be the approach taken . in that case",
    ", our previously mentioned @xmath55 gyr should be directly comparable to their value of 0.71 gyr .",
    "the situation becomes slightly unclear , though , when we refer back to their erratum ( @xcite ) in which it is stated that the proto - galactic radius @xmath56 used was actually a factor of two larger than that predicted by the saito ( 1979a ) mass - radius relations .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the proto - galactic binding energy is a factor of two smaller . assuming that to be the case ,",
    "if we re - run the last model , we find @xmath57 gyr . equally confusing , the preprint version of the ay87 paper states that they actually adopted a proto - galactic radius which was 4.74 times that given by saito ( 1979a ) adopting this more extreme initial condition , leads to @xmath58 gyr , again due to the reduction in the depth of the potential well .",
    "the confusing nature of the proto - galactic radius used by ay87 makes replicating their results , exactly , difficult . still , based upon",
    "the fact that their published @xmath14 gyr , is closer to what we found when simply using saito s ( 1979a ) binding energy prediction ( @xmath55 gyr ) , as opposed to what was found using arbitrary reductions of factors of @xmath59 , it would seem likely that this is what ay87 assumed . * _ photometric calibrations : _",
    "ay87 ( as described in more detail in @xcite ) did not have access to any super metal - rich ( z@xmath41z@xmath7 ) photometric calibrations ) . as such",
    ", the best they could do was assume that metal - rich dwarfs and giants obeyed the same colour - luminosity relations as z = z@xmath7 stars .",
    "for the dwarf galaxies , whose isms do not exceed z@xmath60z@xmath7 for most of their star forming period , this is not a problem .",
    "for the giant elliptical under consideration in this comparison , though , the bulk of the star formation ( @xmath61 gyr  see table 5 of ay87 ) occurs while the ism metallicity is super - solar , approaching ten times solar after a few tenths of a gigayear .",
    "as noted above , if we use the full grid of worthey ( 1994 ) isochrones , including properly the super - solar metallicity ones , to predict the integrated v - k of the stellar populations at @xmath62 gyr , we find v - k@xmath103.89 , which is @xmath63 mag redder than the mean observed value for this luminosity .",
    "this would imply that @xmath2 is too late for the given initial mass / star formation scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "if we impose the condition that all z@xmath41z@xmath7 stars obey the z = z@xmath7 colour - temperature scale , we would actually predict v - k@xmath103.28 , very much in line with both the observed mean , and that predicted by ay87 . * _ luminosity - weighted metallicity : _ instead of calculating the mean luminosity - weighted metallicity @xmath11_{\\rm v}$ ] , ay87 use the mean of the logarithmic , luminosity - weighted metallicity @xmath64>_{\\rm v}$ ] .",
    "this is somewhat incorrect , as spectral indices scale much closer to z ( number of absorbers ) than to log z ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a simple numerical example illustrating how this could lead to an underestimation of the true stellar metallicity is shown in gibson ( 1996a ) .",
    "ay87 do not include any post - red giant branch contribution ( no horizontal branch , asymptotic giant branch , white dwarfs , etc . ) , which will play a part at some level , especially the lack of agb stars , a point which they themselves acknowledge in their paper .    in summary , we feel confident that we now have a good understanding of the source of the majority of differences in the predictions of ay87 and g96 ; of particular importance would appear to be the galactic wind time / photometric calibration `` conspiracy '' .",
    "for @xmath6 m@xmath7 , g96 s preferred salpeter ( 1955 ) imf model predicted @xmath8 gyr , which is equivalent to @xmath65 erg / sn being made available to the ism thermal energy reservoir . in comparison , ay87 favoured a much flatter imf ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath14 gyr , which still corresponds to @xmath66 erg / sn .",
    "in fact , ay87 s models _ required both a significantly flatter - than - salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , and the late galactic wind time , in order to ensure that enough of the stars formed during the `` super - solar '' metallicity phase sampled the z = z@xmath7 stellar evolution tracks and their respective photometric calibrations .",

    ", one can recover the appropriate photo - chemical properties , with @xmath13 gyr . in this latter scenario ,",
    "the effective energy contribution per sn event is found to increase to @xmath68 erg .    in conclusion ,",
    "ay87 were forced to accept a flatter - than - salpeter ( 1955 ) imf because of their lack of metal - rich photometric calibrations .",
    "this would appear to no longer be a necessity .",
    "also , at some level ay87 were somewhat fortuitous in their recovering the present - day photo - chemical properties within this simple framework , given that the snr energetics were based upon the @xmath69 ism density .",
    "because this would , in general , lead to inordinately late wind epochs , the lowering of the type ii sn - progenitor lower mass limit to 3 m@xmath7 was needed in order for the wind epoch to occur at a more feasible value .",
    "this is very much an example of two wrongs making a right !      a more recent addition to coupled `` elliptical galaxy photo - chemical evolution '' studies , with galactic winds , comes from bcf94 .",
    "their models are similar to ay87 , with the primary difference being a substantial improvement in the input stellar physics .",
    "specifically , bcf94 are able to draw upon their impressive `` in - house '' expertise in stellar evolution theory , generating a self - consistent grid of stellar tracks from the zero age main sequence to the white dwarf / sn stage , for a wide range of masses and metallicities ( @xcite ) .",
    "super - solar photometric calibrations are provided by the newly - available kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres ( with the odd empirical extension ) .",
    "bcf94 do not list their yield sources , so one must bear this mind when comparing any chemical evolution models .",
    "a more serious problem lies in attempting to replicate their photometric predictions .",
    "it was presumed that the bertelli ( 1994 ) metallicity - dependent isochrones were employed `` as is '' , yet comparing the integrated colours of the simple stellar populations ( ssps ) in the bcf94 paper ( their table 3 ) with those in the original isochrone paper of bertelli ( 1994 ) , shows that some unspecified modifications were made for the bcf94 analysis .",
    "this has now been corroborated by charlot ( 1996 ) , and further quantified by gibson ( 1996a ) .",
    "let us first just list some of the relevant input ingredients to their models .",
    "minor differences in g96 and bcf94 can be seen here , and are ignored for the discussion which follows ; we shall only concern ourselves with the most important ones in the itemized list which follows below : snr thermal energy in the ism follows the older model a@xmath44 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf with @xmath70 m@xmath7 and @xmath71 is adopted ; the ratio of dark - to - luminous mass and radial extents is taken to be five , and the bertin ( 1992 ) formalism followed ; the star formation efficiency @xmath19 is assumed to be 20 gyr@xmath39 , independent of galactic mass ; we shall assume throughout that the arnett ( 1991 ) yields were used for the type ii sne ejecta .",
    "recall from section [ comparison ] that for @xmath6 m@xmath7 , bcf94 found @xmath9 gyr was necessary to recover the proper present - day photo - chemical properties .",
    "contrast this with the 0.44 and 0.71 gyr found , respectively by g96 and ay87 . as we will show now , the comparison which we undertook with bcf94 , resulted in the identification of one or two potential problem areas .",
    "note that in places we ignore the small differences in @xmath2 invoked by input ingredient variations .",
    "changes at the level shown in the corresponding items of section [ ay87 ] are to be expected .    * _ sne progenitors : _ unlike ay87",
    ", bcf94 do include type ia sne , but only in the calculation of the ism energetics .",
    "their role in enriching the ism ( and in particular the iron abundance ) is not considered . obviously then , they are not concerned with predicting [ mg / fe]@xmath25 in the resultant stellar populations , nor with the predicted [ @xmath72/fe ] ratio for the intracluster medium . * _ stellar metallicity determination : _",
    "bcf94 do not present luminosity - weighted metallicities , but opt for a mass - weighted determination .",
    "this is usually the recourse for codes which do not have a parallel photometric evolution code ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; elbaz 1995 ) .",
    "as noted in ay87 and gibson ( 1996a ) , this can , in some instances , lead one to overestimate the true metallicity of the system , although this does not impact on the results which follow . *",
    "_ pre - sn stellar wind energetics : _ bcf94 have adopted what we feel is an unrealistic energy formalism for stellar wind energy deposition to the ism .",
    "in fact , in the bcf94 models , sne are a completely inconsequential component to ism energetics , and it is the enormous stellar wind energy which leads to their consistently small values for @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is at odds with all the previously mentioned galactic wind studies .",
    "we realize that bcf94 _ needed to impose an early ( @xmath73 gyr ) galactic wind in order to recover the present - day elliptical galaxy cml relations ( see next item below ) , but from a physical standpoint their arguments do not seem sound , as discussed already in gibson ( 1994a ) m@xmath7 ( @xcite ) . ] . regardless of this physics ,",
    "bressan ( 1996 ) and tantalo ( 1996 ) still maintain that stellar wind energy of this magnitude is a necessity .",
    "_ + we do not want to repeat the argument of gibson ( 1994a ) here , but there are two comments which should be made  _ first , early galactic wind times of the sort promoted by bcf94 are entirely feasible with the standard _ sne - driven scenario .",
    "all of the individual snr models talked about thus far ( models a@xmath44 and b@xmath17 of gibson 1994b ) assume shells expand in isolation _ ad infinitum . as we saw in previous sections ,",
    "this resulted in the effective energy contribution to the ism per sn being of the order @xmath74 erg .",
    "there is certainly no reason to expect that such a behaviour is necessarily the correct one . as larson ( 1974 ) himself noted , in reality , shells will come into contact and merge / overlap with neighbouring shells , forming large superbubbles ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent sne will continue to explode inside the low density medium behind the expanding superbubble , and as such suffer far less from radiative losses .",
    "this can easily raise the effective energy contribution per sn from @xmath75 erg to @xmath76 erg .",
    "larson ( 1974 ) claims a value of @xmath77 is actually more appropriate .",
    "this , perhaps , more realistic snr evolution model is denoted model b@xmath78 in gibson s ( 1994b ) notation .",
    "a template of models ( parallel to that shown in table [ tbl : templatemodels2 ] ) using such an snr evolutionary scenario has already been presented in gibson & matteucci ( 1996 ) , and will not be discussed further here .",
    "second , and primary reason for not arguing the pros and cons of the different snr evolution models here , is that there appears to be a potential error in the bcf94 chemical evolution code , which , when accounted for , would seem to remove the necessity for an early galactic wind in their study .",
    "let us discuss this further in the following item , as it is of primary importance to interpreting the bcf94 results .",
    "_ _ _ _ * _ chemical evolution : _ figure 9 of bcf94 shows the evolution of the ism metallicity z@xmath79 , for their favoured suite of models . with the identical input parameters , we ran both our code ( g96 ) and that belonging to matteucci ( 1992 ) ( hereafter , m92 ) , in order to compare against the bcf94 code , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the top panel shows the evolution of the system gas mass fraction ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "consistency is seen between each of the three codes .",
    "it is the bottom panel which indicates that something _ may be amiss with bcf94 s chemical evolution code , the consistency was excellent .",
    "it seems unlikely that all four of these chemical evolution codes have made the same error , and one is left with the impression that the problem lies in the bcf94 code .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the problem beyond this level without more knowledge concerning the nature of the bcf94 yield implementation . ] .",
    "if , though , we were to artificially increase the yields by @xmath81% , then both the g96 and m92 curves would overlay precisely bcf94 s .",
    "how overestimating the yields by @xmath82% would impact upon bcf94 s conclusions proves most interesting . _",
    "+ figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the predicted metallicity - luminosity ( upper panel ) and colour - luminosity ( lower panel ) behaviour from two different observational sources .",
    "the data in the upper panel is from terlevich ( 1981 ) , and that in the lower panel is derived from bower ( 1992 ) .",
    "overlain on each data - set are several model predictions .",
    "+ curve 2 of figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows graphically the predictions of g96 s template ( table [ tbl : templatemodels2 ] ) .",
    "recall that the choice of the star formation efficiency parameter @xmath19 shown in the table ensured the models agreed with the observations .",
    "recall , also , that the galactic wind time @xmath2 was set solely by the snr energetics ( no pre - sn mass - loss thermalized kinetic energy ) , and for giant ellipticals , @xmath83 gyr .",
    "+ now , if we assume , as figure [ fig : fig2 ] suggests , that bcf94 have overestimated their yields by @xmath82% , we can predict what sort of cml relation bcf94 _ would have found , _ if they had only used the conventional model a@xmath44 snr energetics , with no additional pre - sn stellar wind energy , along with the incorrect yields . for their @xmath84 gyr@xmath39 ( and salpeter 1955 imf with @xmath70 m@xmath7 and @xmath71 m@xmath7 ) ,",
    "said prediction is given by curve 1 in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , with @xmath83 gyr , for the massive ellipticals , as in g96 .",
    "first , the relations are too flat ( particularly in the colour - luminosity plane ) , but that simply reflects their adoption of a mass - independent value for @xmath19 .",
    "second , and much more importantly , the predicted metallicities and v - k colours are @xmath85 dex ( @xmath85 mag ) too high ( red ) .",
    "this demonstrates exactly why bcf94 needed to invoke non - standard stellar wind energetics ( recall gibson 1994a ) , in order to get the galactic wind to occur early enough so that enrichment could not drive the relations too rich / red . _ _ + curve 4 resembles curve 1 in that the arnett ( 1991 ) yields have been scaled upwards by @xmath82% , _ but we have imposed the galactic wind times , as given by bcf94 , to each of the models",
    ". these should be the direct analog of bcf94 s models .",
    "these latter models are denoted as curve 3 in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the metallicity - luminosity agreement between the two is excellent ( especially when we consider that bcf94 used a mass - weighted metallicity determination in lieu of a luminosity - weighted one ) .",
    "the ( v - k)m@xmath86 relation given by curve 4 is offset by @xmath87 mag from curve 3 , because of the redder giant branch in worthey s ( 1994 ) z = z@xmath7 isochrones .",
    "this well - known effect has already been discussed by gibson ( 1996a ) and charlot ( 1996 ) .",
    "one can now see , especially from the lower panel of figure [ fig : fig3 ] , why bcf94 preferred their early wind formalism , as it gives the appearance of solving the problem presented by curve 1 .",
    "we presume that bcf94 were only concerned with recovering the colour - luminosity relation in the bottom panel , as the metallicity - luminosity relation of the upper panel for their curve 3 ( or curve 4 , for that matter ) , lies below the terlevich ( 1981 ) calibration . on the other hand , the terlevich ( 1981 ) calibration",
    "may overestimate the true metallicity by @xmath88 dex ( @xcite ) , so we should not overinterpret this particular constraint . _",
    "+ on the other hand , what might we expect if bcf94 s early wind epochs ( dominant pre - sn stellar wind energy ) were appropriate , _ and the yields were brought back down in line with arnett s ( 1991 ) tables ?",
    "the answer is provided by curve 5 in figure [ fig : fig3 ] . for the given imf and star formation efficiency , _",
    "if the yields were accounted for properly , bcf94 would have found metallicities ( colours ) which were too low ( blue ) by @xmath89 dex ( @xmath90 mag ) .",
    "we confirmed this with matteucci s ( 1995 ) mass - weighted metallicity determination code , as applied to models derived from her 1992 chemical evolution code , with enforced wind times to match those of bcf94 .",
    "curve 6 of figure [ fig : fig3 ] illustrates this result ( which parallels that of curve 5 , as it should ) . _ _    in summary , bcf94 , bressan ( 1996 ) , and tantalo ( 1996 ) have each stressed that the primary motivation for invoking early galactic winds ( @xmath73 gyr ) via thermalized kinetic energy from pre - sn mass - loss , was not necessarily a `` physical '' one , but more out of necessity , in order to recover the present - day cml relations .",
    "as we have demonstrated above , what drove them to this conclusion appears to have been an overestimation of the metal yields ( by @xmath82% ) in their chemical evolution code .",
    "correcting this apparent problem removes their entire motivation for looking for an energy source capable of powering early galactic winds in the first place !",
    "this is further corroborated by the downward `` extensions '' to curve 1 of figure [ fig : fig3 ] . here",
    "the @xmath37 m@xmath7 models are shown by the asterisks , along curve 1 in both panels , where bcf94 would have predicted it to be , assuming no stellar wind energy and arnett ( 1991 ) yields scaled upwards by @xmath82% .",
    "again , the @xmath2 is @xmath91 gyr , in this case . _",
    "if bcf94 had simply retained the sn energetics , but used the arnett ( 1991 ) yields , as is , the predictions would shift to the lower part of the respective extensions .",
    "as one can see , the values are in - line with the observations , and any further `` tweaking '' could be accomplished by modifying @xmath19 upwards , slightly . once again , the point to be made is that `` late '' galactic winds ( @xmath83 gyr ) are more than adequate to recover the cml relations , _ provided the chemical evolution properly reflects the sne yield predictions . _ _",
    "a comparison of the galactic wind codes of ay87 and g96 demonstrates quite clearly that ay87 s conclusion that the imf in elliptical galaxies _ must be flatter - than - salpeter ( 1955 ) , with a slope , by mass , of @xmath12 , is purely an artifact of missing metal - rich ( z@xmath41z@xmath7 ) photometric calibrations .",
    "two erroneous assumptions in their model ( that the ism density is not a function of time , and that all stars of mass @xmath92 m@xmath7 end their lives as type ii sne ) fortuitously combine to yield wind times and photo - chemical properties which resemble the present - day observations . _    in referring to the early wind predictions of bcf94 , it would appear that the criticism of gibson ( 1994a ) was incomplete . at that point",
    "we had argued against pre - sn mass - loss via stellar winds playing such a prominent role in setting @xmath2 , purely from a physical standpoint , _ but that one could still get early winds via proper handling of conventional sn energetics ( see also g96 and @xcite ) .",
    "we still stand by these arguments , but , more importantly ( and a point which we did not appreciate in the earlier @xcite ) , as we have demonstrated in section [ bcf94 ] , it would appear that bcf94 s argument for an early wind , in the first place , was predicated upon a substantially different , and perhaps incorrect , treatment of nucleosynthetic yields in their chemical evolution code . scaling bcf94 s yields down to the tabulated arnett ( 1991 ) values",
    "removes the _ necessity for the early wind .",
    "it _ may still occur early ( @xmath73 gyr ) in the evolution ( @xcite ) , but it is no longer a _ necessity .",
    "_ _    more sophisticated models , than those discussed here , are needed before the `` early '' versus `` late '' wind - dichotomy can be resolved .",
    "specifically , do sne contribute @xmath93 ergs ( late ) or @xmath76 ergs ( early ) ?",
    "even knowledge at this level may not be enough to resolve the problem , as it also depends intimately upon the assumed imf and star formation formalism .",
    "for the simple models discussed here , with star formation proportional to the available gas mass , all we can really say is that a standard salpeter ( imf ) with late ( @xmath94 gyr for giant ellipticals ) winds successfully recovers the present - day cml relations , _ but then so do early ( @xmath95 gyr ) wind models with a flatter - than - salpeter ( 1955 ) imf of slope @xmath96 .",
    "one can imagine that other combinations are potentially available . at some level ,",
    "the arguments of mihara & takahara ( 1994 ) for simply treating @xmath2 as a free parameter seem appealing , although we still feel it important to at least be aware of the different claims from the groups discussed in this paper , and understand how and why the differences come about . _",
    "i wish to thank francesca matteucci for her ongoing support .",
    "confirming the stability of my own chemical evolution code has been made infinitely easier by the willingness of her , frank timmes , and leticia carigi to run numerous test cases for me , with their own code , with which to compare .",
    "the financial support of nserc , through its postdoctoral fellowship program , is gratefully acknowledged ."
