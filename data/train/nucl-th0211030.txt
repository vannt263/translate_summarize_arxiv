    "the aim of this paper is to study the influence of the additional @xmath1 meson and nonlinear vector meson interactions on neutron star parameters .",
    "the considered model comprises : nucleons , mesons and leptons .",
    "the starting point is the construction of the effective lagrangian intended for application to the model described @xmath2 the scalar sector consists of two isoscalar ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and two isovector ( @xmath5 and @xmath1 ) mesons , denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "meson @xmath1 has to be included as the model describes highly asymmetric neutron star matter .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the field tensors , the covariant derivative is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the potential function has the form @xmath14 the nucleon masses are denoted by @xmath15 whereas @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are masses assigned to the meson fields .",
    "+ the parameters entering the lagrangian function ( [ lag ] ) have been chosen to reproduce the equilibrium properties of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "as it is usually assumed in quantum hadrodynamics @xcite the mean field approximation is adopted and for the ground state of homogeneous infinite matter , quantum fields operators are replaced by their classical expectation values .",
    "thus mesonic fields can be separated into classical mean field values and quantum fluctuations which are not included in the ground state : @xmath20 the field equations derived from the lagrangian function at the mean field level are @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 their forms indicate the in - medium modification of meson and nucleon masses @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath25 is expressed with the use of fermi integrals @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the spin and isospin projection , @xmath29 is the fermi momentum of species n ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 denotes the baryon density .",
    "the effective nucleon mass which follows from the dirac equation has the form @xmath32           the analyzed form of the equation of state leads to the conclusion that the inclusion of @xmath1 meson and nonlinear vector meson interactions causes the softening of the equation of state and in the result the decrease of the neutron star parameters ( fig.3 ) .",
    "of special interest is the case which includes @xmath1 meson , the quartic @xmath5 meson term and nonlinear vector meson interactions ( set iii in table i ) .",
    "this case leads to the neutron star model with the value of the maximum radius @xmath33 km .",
    "this result is consistent with recent observations @xcite of rx j185635 - 3754",
