    "when we make mention to the convergence of a system of random walks , we always consider one - dimensional random walks and diffusive space time scaling . in this introduction , we aim at describing informally the system and explain why its study is relevant .    first , the limit is the brownian web ( bw ) which is a system of coalescing brownian motions starting at each point in the space and time plane @xmath1 .",
    "it is the natural scaling limit of a system of simple coalescing random walks . here",
    ", the bw is a proper random element of a metric space whose points are compact sets of paths .",
    "this characterization of the bw was given by fontes , isopi , newman , ravishankar @xcite , although formal descriptions of systems of coalescing brownian motions had previously been considered , initially by arratia @xcite and then by tth , werner @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the study of convergence in distribution of systems of random walks to the bw and its variations has become an active field of research , for instance , see @xcite .    in fontes ,",
    "isopi , newman , ravishankar @xcite a general convergence criteria for the bw is obtained but only verified for a system of simple coalescing random walks that evolve independently up to the time of coalescence ( no crossing paths ) .",
    "these criteria are used in newman , ravishankar , sun @xcite to prove convergence to the brownian web of coalescing nonsimple random walks that evolve independently up to the time of coalescence ( crossing paths ) .",
    "coletti , fontes , dias @xcite have proved the convergenge of the bw for a system of coalescing random walks introduced by gangopadhyay , roy , sarkar @xcite .",
    "this system is called the drainage network .",
    "it evolves in the space time lattice @xmath0 in the following way : each site of @xmath0 is considered open or closed according to an iid family of bernoulli random variables ; if at time @xmath2 a walk is at site @xmath3 then at time @xmath4 its position is the open site nearest to @xmath3 ( if we have two possible choices for the nearest open site , we choose one of them with probability @xmath5 ) .",
    "the drainage network is a system of coalescing nonsimple random walks with long range jumps where no crossing paths may occur .",
    "futhermore the random walks paths are dependent before coalescence .",
    "these properties make the convergence of the drainage network to the bw a relevant and nontrivial example .",
    "we propose here a natural generalization of the drainage network and prove the convergence to the bw .",
    "if at time @xmath2 a walk occupies the site @xmath3 , then it chooses at random @xmath6 and jumps to the @xmath7th open site nearest to @xmath3 , see the next section for the formal description .",

    "we suggest to the reader the discussion on @xcite about the addicional difficulties that arise in the study of convergence of systems of coalescing random walks when crossing paths may occur .",

    "the estimate we need on the distribution of the coalescing time of two random walks in the drainage network starting at time zero is that the probability that they coalesce after time @xmath151 is of order @xmath152 .",

    "t and e. the idea we carry on here is that if convergence to the bw holds for a system with non - crossing paths then the proof of @xcite can be adapted to similar systems allowing crossing paths if we have proposition [ prop : coaltime1 ] and condition @xmath175 . in this direction",

    "then , by the locally finiteness of @xmath197 and condition @xmath175 we get that @xmath191 is distributed as coalescing brownian motions starting from the random set @xmath194 .",
