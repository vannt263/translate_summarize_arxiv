    "the scarcity of micro - wave ( @xmath0w ) cellular frequency for achieving the 1,000x higher data rate in 5 g brings about the overlay of millimeter - wave ( mmw ) frequency that provides hundreds times more spectrum amount @xcite .",
    "such an approach however has two major drawbacks .",
    "firstly , mmw signals are vulnerable to physical blockages , yielding severe distance attenuation for both downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) transmissions .",
    "secondly , utilizing extremely wide mmw bandwidth makes ul mmw transmissions at mobiles demanding due to high peak - to - average - ratio ( papr ) @xcite .",
    "it leads to significant rate difference between dl and ul .",
    "this dl / ul rate mismatch may hinder consistent user experiences during dl / ul symmetric services such as video over lte or cloud gaming .",
    "furthermore , it may even decrease dl rate when the ul rate can not cope with the required control signals for dl .",
    "for the first blockage problem , the densification of mmw bss is a straightforward remedy without procuring additional spectrum , leading to equally improve both dl and ul rates . in spite of such a solution ,",
    "the second dl / ul rate asymmetry problem still remains , of which the dl / ul rate ratio holds the same amount .    to tackle this bottleneck , we focus on the role of the incumbent @xmath0w bs densification as well as its dl / ul resource allocation . specifically , our prime concern is maximizing the overall ( mmw and @xmath0w ) dl rate while guaranteeing a minimum ul rate . for",
    "given mmw resource amount and bs density , this paper answers the question _ how much amount of @xmath0w resource should be allocated to ul transmissions_.    this resource management solution hinges on the dl / ul mmw and @xmath0w spectral efficiencies ( ses ) . from its analytic perspective",
    ", we apply the sate - of - the - art stochastic geometric approaches for the mmw blockage model in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we further develop the three - dimensional ( 3d ) blockage model proposed in @xcite based on the actual geography of the buildings in seoul , korea .",
    "combined with the 3d mmw blockage model , we derive the maximized overall dl rate in a closed - form on the basis of our preliminary se analysis in an ultra - dense cellular regime @xcite .",
    "the overall ul rate is also provided in a closed - form by means of a novel upper / lower bound technique .",
    "such closed - form results enable the tractable optimization of the resource management , and thereby provide the design guidelines of the mmw overlaid ultra - dense cellular network ( udn ) .",
    "w two - tier 5 g cellular network .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 transmissions , mmw ul transmissiosn are : ( i ) blockage non - penetrable and ( ii ) dl / ul asymmetric since mmw ul resource allocation is restricted by the papr at mobiles . to compensate the mismatch ,",
    "@xmath0w dl / ul resource allocation is optimized in order to maximize the overall dl rate with a minimum ul rate constraint.,width=340 ]    the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows .    1 .",
    "most of the @xmath0w resource should be dedicated to ul transmissions in order to resolve the ul bottleneck in a mmwave overlaid ultra - dense cellular networks : for @xmath1 mhz mmw bandwidth with @xmath2% ul / dl minimum rate ratio requirement , more than @xmath3% of the @xmath0w spectrum should be allocated to ul ; for @xmath4 ghz mmw bandwidth , the entire @xmath0w should be dedicated to ul ( see fig .",
    "the @xmath0w and mmw ses for both dl and ul are derived in closed forms that reveal bs densifications logarithmically increase the ses ( see theorems 1 and 2 ) .",
    "numerical results are verified with a 3d mmw blockage model with the actual building geography in seoul , korea ( see figs . 4 and 5 with table i ) .",
    "the proposed two - tier network comprises : ( i ) mmw bss whose locations follow a two - dimensional ( 2d ) homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath5 with density @xmath6 ; and ( ii ) @xmath0w bss whose coordinates follow a homogeneous ppp @xmath7 with density @xmath8 , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "mobile user coordinates independently follow a homogeneous ppp @xmath9 with density @xmath10 . without loss of generality , @xmath9 represents both dl and ul users . for simplicity ,",
    "we hereafter only focus on outdoor users whose coordinates do not overlap with building blockages .",
    "users simultaneously associate with mmw and @xmath0w bss via different antennas for each as in macro - and - small - cell dual connectivity @xcite .",
    "the associations for both mmw and @xmath0w guarantee the maximum received signal powers .",
    "the corresponding wireless control signals are communicated via @xmath0w so that it can always guarantee the connections regardless of blockages .",
    "the volume of the control signal transmissions are much less than that of data transmissions , and thus is assumed to be negligible .    for multiple associations of users , each bs selects a single active user per unit time slot according to a uniformly random scheduler , resulting in an active user ppp @xmath11 .",
    "now that bss having no associated users are turned off , such a user selection also leads to active mmw and @xmath0w bs ppps @xmath12 where the bss associate with at least a single active user .",
    "consider building blockages that can not be penetrated by mmw signals .",
    "each single mmw signal reception should therefore ensure line - of - sight ( los ) between the transmitter and receiver pair .",
    "assume that a given transmitter - receiver distance @xmath13 satisfies the los condition if it does not exceed a certain average los distance @xmath14 .",
    "an los indicator function @xmath15 represents such a model , which returns @xmath4 if los exists , i.e. @xmath16 ; otherwise @xmath17 .",
    "this average los distance model proposed by @xcite corresponds with the approximation of a boolean blockage model @xcite , and is similar to distance threshold blockage models @xcite .    for the 3d blockage model , @xmath14",
    "is directly computed by utilizing building perimeters , areas , coverage from actual geographical data , to be specifically elaborated in section [ sect:3dblockage ] . the value of @xmath14 with the 2d blockage model @xcite neglects building height data during its computation . throughout this paper ,",
    "we by default consider the 3d blockage model unless otherwise noted , but apply a 2d channel model that provides more tractability .",
    "incorporating a 3d channel model is deferred to our future work .",
    "in contrast to mmw signals , @xmath0w@xmath0w signals are not affected by blockages thanks to their high diffraction and penetration characteristics .      a mmw antenna array at a bs ( or user for ul )",
    "directionally transmits a signal with unity power to its associated user ( or bs ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the antenna array gains at mmw transmitters and receivers are assumed to be unity .",
    "the transmitted mmw signal experiences path loss attenuation with the exponent @xmath18 as well as rayleigh fading with unity mean , i.e. channel fading power @xmath19 .",
    "the transmitted directional signal has a main lobe beam width @xmath20 radian , and its beam center @xmath21 $ ] points at the associated user ( or bs ) .",
    "the received signal powers at the same distances within the mainlobe are assumed to be identical , and sidelobes are neglected for simplicity . accordingly , at a receiver , interferers are the transmitters whose main lobes cover the location of the receiver . when interference is treated as noise , by the aid of slyvnyak s theorem @xcite , dl / ul mmw @xmath22 for a typical outdoor user is respectively represented as : @xmath23 where @xmath13 and @xmath24 respectively denote the distances to the associated bs ( or user ) and interfering bss ( users ) from the origin , @xmath25 noise power , and @xmath26 the probability that the @xmath27-th transmitter interferers with the typical receiver , i.e. the transmitter s beam pointing at its serving receiver with the direction @xmath28 and beam width @xmath20 covers the typical receiver .",
    "note that @xmath26 is a random variable due to its dependency on the locations of the interfering transmitters associated receivers that are random variables .    a @xmath0w transmitted signal with unity power experiences the same channel model as in mmw signals only except for its different path loss exponent @xmath29 and neglecting blockages . at a typical outdoor user , the @xmath0w @xmath22",
