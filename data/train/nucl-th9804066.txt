    "quantum monte - carlo methods offer an interesting way to study fermionic many - body problems .",
    "accurate calculations of ground - state properties have been performed for light nuclei , using variational and diffusion quantum monte - carlo methods @xcite .",
    "also for the nuclear shell model , monte - carlo methods are very useful @xcite .",
    "they allow to do calculations in much larger model spaces than conventional techniques based on diagonalization .",
    "furthermore , they are very useful for the study of finite - temperature properties of atomic nuclei @xcite",
    ". the same method can also be used as a starting point to calculate nuclear level densities @xcite .",
    "we have used a variant of this method to study thermodynamical properties of nuclei in the fe region with a model based on a mean - field plus pairing hamiltonian . at present",
    ", we are limited to this too simple model , because our quantum monte - carlo method is still in a developing phase and because we are limited by our present computer facilities ( a dec alphastation 255/300mhz workstation and a 200 mhz pentium pc ) .",
    "even though , at present , our results are not conform to realistic hamiltonians , they do say a lot about the general physics properties .",
    "it is a first step to go beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "the present approach gives results about the possibility of a phase transition related to pairing correlations , about the influence of the residual interaction on the level densities and on a number of general features of the nuclear many - body structure at finite temperature .",
    "the combination of a mean - field potential and the pairing hamiltonian leads to a hamiltonian @xmath0 though this hamiltonian looks simple , it already leads to a complicated many - body problem .",
    "an often used technique to tackle this problem , is the bardeen - cooper - shrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite .",
    "it leads to equations that can be handled easily in a numerical way and it has a clear interpretation in terms of quasiparticles .",
    "the disadvantage is that it gives only an approximate solution , and leads to many - body states in which the number of particles is not fixed . for some systems ,",
    "exact solutions can be found @xcite .",
    "a general , accurate solution for this many - body problem is even at present a topic of intensive research @xcite .",
    "we have found that our quantum monte - carlo method is a very useful method in order to study the ground - state and finite - temperature properties of the nuclear pairing hamiltonian .    in section [ sectionmodel ]",
    "we introduce the mean - field plus pairing model that we used for our calculations . in section [ sectionqmc ] aspects of our quantum monte - carlo method",
    "are given , with an emphasis on the differences with related methods . in section [ sectionresults ]",
    "we present a number of results .",
    "the role of the pairing - interaction strength , the size of the model space and the number of particles is discussed .",
    "an estimate is given for the level densities .",

    "this mean field is used for all nuclei in this particular mass region . for every set of quantum numbers",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 , the woods - saxon potential is diagonalized in a basis of the lowest 60 harmonic - oscillator eigenfunctions with the appropriate symmetry . in this way",
    ", the single - particle eigenstates and their energies listed in table [ table1 ] , are obtained .",
    "also a number of unbound states ( with energy @xmath10 ) are obtained .",
    "in fact , the woods - saxon potential exhibits a continuum of unbound eigenstates . due to the expansion in a finite number of basis functions , discrete unbound energy levels are obtained .",
    "these can be seen as a discrete approximation to the continuum of unbound states .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 orbitals are considered to be compeletely filled .",
    "they form an inert core for the many - body problem .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals constitute the valence shell .    a simple hamiltonian that accounts for the short - range correlations induced by the residual interaction , is the nuclear pairing hamiltonian @xmath21 @xcite , that takes the form @xmath22 where the operators @xmath23 create a particle in the corresponding single - particle eigenstates of the mean - field hamiltonian in the valence shell .",
    "the index @xmath24 indicates proton or neutron states , @xmath25 is the time - reversed state of the state @xmath26 .",
    "the notation @xmath27 denotes that the summation for @xmath26 and @xmath28 should run over states with angular momentum projection @xmath29 only .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath30 depends on the model space and the system under study . for the strength of the pairing interaction we take @xmath31 , following the suggestion of bes and sorensen @xcite to take @xmath32 .",
    "the same strength is used for protons and neutrons , and for all nuclei in the fe mass region .",
    "the method we used to study the model is based on the shell - model quantum monte - carlo method .",
    "the basic idea of this method is well explained in reference @xcite .",
    "it amounts to a decomposition of the boltzmann - operator @xmath33 in a sum of exponentials of one - body operators @xmath34 because of their one - body nature , the terms @xmath35 can be handled easily using small matrices , with a dimension equal to the number of single - particle states considered in the model space .",
    "the canonical or grand canonical trace of @xmath35 can be calculated with simple algebraic operations on these matrices .",
    "the sum over the _ auxiliary fields _",
    "@xmath36 is then evaluated using monte - carlo techniques ( in casu the metropolis algorithm @xcite ) .    in our approach ,",
    "a number of technical aspects are implemented differently from reference @xcite .",
    "the main differences are :    * in order to arrive at a decomposition of the form [ edecomp ] , we use the suzuki - trotter formula @xcite to separate the one- and two - body part of the hamiltonian in the exponents .",
    "this reduces the leading systematic error term to order @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the number of inverse - temperature slices . following the prescriptions from reference @xcite",
    ", the leading systematic error term would be of the order @xmath39 . * in order to decompose the exponential of the two - body part of the hamiltonian , we use the discrete hubbard - stratonovich , described in @xcite . compared to the hubbard - stratonovich transform described in @xcite",
    ", it has the advantage that it leads to faster matrix operations and to smaller systematic errors . because of these fast matrix operations",
    ", we could use a large number of inverse - temperature slices in order to reduce the systematic errors ( typically @xmath40 for the @xmath41-model space and @xmath42 for the extended model spaces ) . * in order to evaluate the canonical trace of @xmath35 , we use the fast an efficient algorithm described in reference @xcite instead of the number projection technique described in @xcite . * the trial steps for the metropolis algorithm for the sampling of the discrete auxiliary fields",
    "@xmath36 are generated in the following way : a series of @xmath43 consecutive inverse - temperature intervals are chosen randomly to be updated . because of the permutation properties of the canonical trace , we can always shift these inverse - temperature intervals to the end of the decomposition .",
    "the matrix representation @xmath44 of the operator @xmath45 is calculated up to the @xmath46 inverse - temperature slice and stored in computer memory .",
    "a number @xmath47 between 1 and a maximum number is drawn .",
    "then in the last @xmath43 slices @xmath47 auxiliary fields are drawn .",
    "these are then changed randomly .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 for the altered configuration @xmath49 is constructed out of the stored part of @xmath50 .",
    "the canonical trace of @xmath48 is evaluated .",
    "then the configuration @xmath36 is accepted or rejected according to the metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "this procedure is repeated a number of times ( typically 7 times ) , before a new series of @xmath43 slices is selected .",
    "so a complete markov step consists of 7 local updates .",
    "typical values are @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 for @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 .",
    "this scheme allows to update a large number of auxiliary fields simultaneously , while requiring only @xmath43 matrix multiplications per udpate ( counting the contribution of one inverse - temperature slice as one matrix ) . only after a complete markov step",
    "all the @xmath38 matrices in the decomposition have to be multiplied .",
    "* observables are evaluated after every 5 complete markov steps .",
    "the values are not yet fully decorrelated at this rate ( e.g. autocorrelations between 30% and 60% between consecutive values for the energy ) , but leaving a larger interval would not improve the performance , because already at this rate the most time - consuming part is the construction of the trial configurations for the markov chain .",
    "the value of an observable @xmath55 at inverse temperature @xmath56 is calculated as follows : @xmath57   \\right|_{\\epsilon=0 } , \\\\",

    "the mathematical properties of the trace operator are crucial in going from expression [ exprobs1 ] to expression [ exprobs2 ] .",
    "the one - body operator resulting from the decomposition [ edecomp ] , with @xmath60 replaced by @xmath61 , is denoted by @xmath62 . for the energy ( @xmath63 ) ,",
    "this can easily be implemented as @xmath64 .",
    "the derivatives are evaluated as @xmath65 with @xmath66 a small but finite number ( typically @xmath67 ) .",
    "this way of evaluating observables requires a lot of matrix manipulations because the complete matrix @xmath50 has to be recalculated from scratch for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "however , because most of the computing time goes to the construction of the trial moves , this has little impact on the overall performance .",
    "furthermore , this way of evaluating the observables leads to small statistical errors , because it amounts to an insertion of the operator @xmath55 at each inverse - temperature interval , whereas the procedure described in @xcite is based on the insertion of @xmath55 only at the first interval .",
    "a special remark concerns the evaluation of the specific heat @xmath70 .",
    "this quantity can not be calculated as the expectation value of an observable .",
    "we evaluate @xmath70 after the monte - carlo run as @xmath71 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "e_{2 \\sigma } & = &   \\frac{d^2}{(d \\beta)^2 }   \\log \\left[\\mbox{tr}_{n } \\left(e^{\\hat{h}_{\\beta,\\sigma } } \\right ) \\right ] + e_{\\sigma}^2 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the observable @xmath72 corresponds to the square of the hamiltonian : @xmath73 * just like any other quantum monte - carlo method for fermions @xcite , this method suffers from a sign problem at low temperatures . the value of the weights @xmath74 can become negative .",
    "this poses a problem for the metropolis algorithm , because it requires that @xmath74 can be interpreted as a probability density .",
    "the metropolis algorithm can still be used by applying it to the absolute value @xmath75 .",
    "then we have to treat the sign @xmath76 of @xmath74 as an observable .",
    "expression [ observs ] becomes : @xmath77 the problem is that the statistical error on this expression scales as @xmath78 ( see below ) .",
    "now , for an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons , one can exploit a symmetry between states with @xmath79 and states with @xmath80 .",
    "this symmetry guarantees that @xmath81 is close to 1 even at low temperature @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite it was claimed that the canonical trace should be exactly equal to one for even particle numbers with interactions that lead to matrix representations of the form @xmath82 as is the case with a pure pairing force or a pairing - plus - quadrupole force .",
    "this is not exactly true however , as can be seen from the following counterexample : let @xmath50 be a @xmath83 matrix , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are @xmath86 matrices , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a real number . then the grand canonical trace is given by @xmath90 which is positively definite for any value of the chemical potential @xmath91 .",
    "the canonical 2-particle trace is given by the coefficient of @xmath92 : @xmath93 which is negative .",
    "the average sign for some of the systems we studied is shown in figure [ figurepairnsigns ] as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath94 .",
    "the sign for the even particle numbers shows a dip around @xmath95 .",
    "this is caused by the fact that for a fraction of the @xmath50 the canonical trace becomes negative , like in the above example .",
    "however , the symmetry between @xmath79 states and @xmath80 states guarantees that the contribution to the trace of the fully accompagnied states , in the sense defined in reference @xcite , will always be positive .",
    "these states dominate the low temperature trace for even - even nuclei",
    ". therefore the sign tends to one again at low temperatures . for odd particle numbers",
    ", @xmath81 tends to zero at low temperatures .",
    "so there the statistical errors explode .",
    "we find that even for odd nuclei we can do calculations at @xmath96 , which is enough to cool the system almost completely to its ground state .",
    "for the model studied here , the average sign posed no problems .",
    "however , for more complicated hamiltonians , one probably will have to fall back on extrapolation techniques as the ones described in references @xcite and @xcite , in order to overcome the sign problem .",
    "* because the metropolis algorithm leads to correlations amongst successive values for the observables , care has to be taken to establish accurate error limits . in order",
    "to get rid of the correlations , 50 independent markov chains are run for each calculation .",
    "these markov chains typically consist of some 600 thermalization steps and 3000 sampling steps , with an evaluation of observables every @xmath97 step .",
    "+ so the chains are rather short , but long enough to make sure that the computing time is not dominated by the thermalization steps .",
    "this leads to 50 independent estimates @xmath98 for the quantity @xmath99 . to obtain the final estimate",
    ", we take the weighted average of these values , with the average signs @xmath100 as weights .",
    "so we obtain an estimate @xmath101 for @xmath99 : @xmath102 if the @xmath103 and @xmath104 are obtained with enough precision , then a good estimate for the statistical error on [ weighteda ] can be obtained from the following expression : @xcite @xmath105 ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the variance and covariance ) . taking @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,",
    "leads to an estimate for the variance on @xmath101 : @xmath110 under the assumption that @xmath101 is almost normally distributed , which is a good approximation because @xmath101 is a weighted average of 50 independent values , this expression allows us to determine a 95%-confidence interval @xmath111 $ ] for @xmath99 .",
    "expression [ avar ] also demonstrates that the statistical error is inversely proportional to the average sign @xmath81 .",
    "some thermodynamical properties of the pairing model for @xmath7 were studied using the quantum monte - carlo method presented in section [ sectionqmc ] . because the proton and neutron systems are not coupled to one another ,",
    "separate results for both particle types are obtained . the internal energy of the total system and the contributions of the proton and neutron subsystems are shown as a function of temperature in figure [ figurepairprotonneutrone ] .",
    "the same is done for the specific heat in figure [ figurepairprotonneutronc1 ] .",
    "the neutrons contribute more to the internal energy than the protons do , because there are more valence neutrons than valence protons .",
    "this also leads to a slightly stronger peak in the specific - heat curve for neutrons than for protons .",
    "qualitatively , there is no big difference between the thermodynamical properties of both subsystems .",
    "this is not the case at lower values of the interaction strength @xmath112 .",
    "we have studied the pairing model for @xmath7 for several values of the pairing interaction strength .",
    "calculations were performed for @xmath113 neutrons in a shell with @xmath114 valence states ( @xmath115 , @xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals ) and for @xmath116 protons in the same shell .",
    "the neutron energy as a function of temperature is shown in figure [ figurepairneutrone ] .",
    "the energy scale is chosen such that the inert core has zero energy .",
    "the fact that the energy does not go to much higher values as the temperature increases , is due to the limited size of the model space : not enough high - lying states are included .",
    "as we shall discuss later on , the results for @xmath117 are not physical anymore . for larger values of @xmath112 ,",
    "the system is more strongly bound .",
    "furthermore , when raising the temperature , the system stays in its ground state longer than for smaller values of @xmath112 .",
    "this indicates that there is an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state proportional to @xmath112 , as is expected from bcs theory @xcite . the neutron specific heat , as a function of temperature , is shown in figure [ figurepairneutronc1 ] .",
    "with increasing strength @xmath112 , the peak in the specific heat curve shifts to a slightly higher temperature and becomes more pronounced .",
    "in general , peaks in the specific heat can be interpreted as signs of a phase transition .",
    "we see here that the pairing correlations , for @xmath118 , seem to induce a phase transition in the system .",
    "analogous calculations were done for protons .",
    "the proton energy as a function of temperature is shown in figure [ figurepairprotone ] .",
    "the proton specific heat is shown as a function of temperature in figure [ figurepairprotonc1 ] .",
    "the same discussion as for the neutron results , applies here .",
    "there is , however , a striking difference in the specific - heat curve for low values of @xmath112 : a second peak develops around @xmath119 for @xmath120 . at this value of the pairing strength , the broad peak in the specific - heat curve , around @xmath121 , coincides with the peak in the the specific - heat curve for a pure mean field .",
    "this peak is related to the condensation of the valence particles in the lowest energy levels of the valence shell ( the @xmath17 orbital ) .",
    "the smaller is entirely due to pair correlations , that develop among the 6 particles in the @xmath17 orbital . in figure",
    "[ figurepairprotonvp ] , the expectation value of the pairing interaction operator @xmath21 is shown as a function of the temperature @xmath122 . while the system with @xmath123 reaches full pairing strength at temperatures @xmath124 , the system with @xmath125 comes to this regime only at values of @xmath126 . in figure",
    "[ figurepairprotonnf ] , the number particles in the @xmath17 orbital and the number of particles in the other orbitals are shown .",
    "for the system with @xmath125 , it is observed that approximately all 6 particles occupy states in the @xmath17 orbital for values of @xmath127 .",
    "the fact that the pairing correlations reach their maximum for this system only at values of @xmath126 , means that the system passes through two phases as it is cooled : first , the 6 valence protons condense into the @xmath17 orbital . at @xmath128 , this stage",
    "is completed .",
    "if the temperature is lowered further , pair correlations among these particles can develop . at values of @xmath126",
    "the system is almost completely cooled to its ground state . for the system with @xmath123 ,",
    "the occupation of the @xmath17 orbital reaches a maximum of about 5.3 .",
    "the particles always remain spread over all the valence orbitals , because now the pairing interaction is strong enough to scatter them out of the @xmath17 orbital , even in the ground state .      for the description of the high - temperature properties of the system ,",
    "the model space given by the @xmath129 shell is too small . at temperatures of a few mev",
    ", valence particles can be excited to higher - lying single - particle states , or core particles can be excited into the valence orbitals or higher energy states . in order to know up to what temperatures the results that we obtained in the @xmath129 shell are valid",
    ", we performed a number of calculations in larger model spaces .",
    "first , the @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 orbitals are added to the single - particle space .",
    "this leads to a many - body problem of 6 and 10 particles in 42 single - particle states . in a second extended model",
    "the core states are considered as valence states too .",
    "therefore the @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , @xmath139 are added .",
    "furthermore , also the @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 orbitals are taken into account .",
    "this leads to a many - body problem of 26 and 30 particles in 78 single - particle states .",
    "because multiple shells are used , the model space of the extended systems contains spurious excitations related to center - of - mass motion .",
    "therefore , care has to be taken when relating high temperature results to internal excitations of the system . for the largest model space ( without core )",
    ", these center - of - mass motions can be interpreted as thermal excitations of the collective degrees of freedom .",
    "this picture would be physically meaningful in the absence of a mean - field potential .",
    "the fact that the mean - field potential is localized in space , breaks the translational invariance of the model .",
    "therefore , one can not separate the center - of - mass motion from the intrinsic excitations in a clean way @xcite .",
    "a consistent treatment of spurious states is a topic for further research .",
    "the results for the energy and the specific heat obtained using these model spaces are shown in figure [ figurepairneutronxe ] to [ figurepairprotonxc1 ] .",
    "if the value for the pairing interaction strength @xmath112 is not changed , then a system with a larger model space will have a lower ground - state energy because the larger model space allows stronger pair correlations . in order to obtain a comparable pairing energy , a reduced pairing interaction strength of @xmath144",
    "is used for the extended model spaces . for the no - core system ,",
    "the energy is shifted such that the ground - state energy coincides with the ground - state energy of the @xmath129 shell system .    in the largest model space , at high temperatures ( @xmath145 ) , the specific - heat curve coincides with the specific - heat curve for @xmath146 . in this temperature region , the proton and neutron energy are some @xmath147 lower than in the @xmath146 case .",
    "apart from this shift , the energy curves are similar to the @xmath146 case .",
    "this indicates that , at high temperatures , the pairing hamiltonian enhances the binding energy but has no effect on the internal structure .    at lower temperatures ,",
    "the specific heat curve deviates from the curve for @xmath146 , because pairing correlations develop . by comparing the results for the @xmath129 shell and the first extended model space , we see that even the @xmath129 shell is too small to describe the system at temperatures @xmath148 . in order to compare with the results for the second extended model space around temperatures of @xmath149 , the pairing interaction strength @xmath112 ought to be reduced somewhat more for the latter model space .",
    "the vanishing of pair correlations with increasing temperature , starting from @xmath150 , was also observed in shell - model quantum monte - carlo calculations for @xmath151 based on more realistic interactions @xcite . the interesting topic of proton - neutron pairing in @xmath152 nuclei @xcite , could of course not be adressed in our too schematic model used at present .",
    "the schematic form of the interaction also urges for a caveat : in the larger model spaces , the pairing interaction scatters particles into woods - saxon orbitals that extend into regions where the mean field vanishes ( the orbitals beyond the core and the fp shell ) .",
    "because the pairing interaction introduces correlations in the angular coordinates but not in the radial coordinates , one might expect the ground state wavefunction to extend too far into space .",
    "a more realistic interaction would localize the wavefunction more closely to the core .",
    "our calculations show that these extended orbitals contribute only about 1 % of the ground state density .",
    "therefore we think that this has only a minor effect on the energy - like observables we are interested in here .",
    "we studied systems with various numbers of neutrons in the @xmath129 shell : @xmath151 , @xmath153 , @xmath7 and @xmath154 are modelled by considering @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath113 and @xmath157 neutrons in the @xmath129 valence shell , respectively . for the systems with @xmath156 and @xmath157 neutrons , the sign problem limits accurate calculations to values of @xmath158",
    "fortunately , this temperature is low enough to get a good approximation of the ground state .",
    "the neutron energy @xmath159 for the various systems is shown as a function of temperature in figure [ figurepairnu ] .",
    "the proton internal energy is not shown because it is equal for all four systems and it is already given in figure [ figurepairprotone ] . while at high temperature the energy curves are equidistantly spaced , with an interval of about @xmath160 , there is a relative shift to lower energies for the systems with @xmath155 and @xmath113 neutrons at low energy .",
    "this is because the pairing correlations are stronger for the even systems than for the odd systems at temperatures below @xmath149 .",
    "the shift in the energy for the system with 10 neutrons can be quantified as @xmath161 with @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 the neutron energies for the systems with 9 , 10 and 11 valence neutrons respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath165 is shown as a function of temperature in figure [ figurepairndu ] .",
    "the ground - state energy shift was calculated analogously to expression [ intushift ] , with the energies replaced by the mass excesses given in reference @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath166 is obtained .",
    "our quantum monte - carlo results approach this value remarkably well at temperatures below @xmath167 .",
    "because the internal energy is related to the derivative of the logarithm of the partition function @xmath168 and because @xmath168 is the laplace transform of the level density @xmath169 of excited states , the results presented above also give information about the level density .",
    "the partition function can be obtained by numerical integration of the internal energy",
    ". then one should apply an inverse laplace transform on @xmath168 .",
    "because of the statistical errors on the internal energies and hence on @xmath168 , this is however an ill - posed problem",
    ". a good approximation ( at high enough energies ) is given by the saddle - point approximation : @xmath170 our quantum monte - carlo method gives accurate results for @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "so the level density in the saddle - point approximation is easily obtained .",
    "figure [ figurelevel1 ] shows the level densities derived from the results shown in figures [ figurepairneutronxe ] , [ figurepairneutronxc1 ] , [ figurepairprotonxe ] and [ figurepairprotonxc1 ] .",
    "the results for the smallest model space only go up to excitation energies of 25 mev .",
    "they are in good agreement with the results for the first extended model space , up to energies of 20 mev . however , the results for the largest model space deviate from these , even at energies below 20 mev .",
    "this indicates that it is important to consider also core excitations when calculating level densities .",
    "figure [ figurelevel1 ] also shows the level - density curve from a backshifted bethe formula cited in reference @xcite , with parameters @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "this parametrization was fitted to experimental data @xcite in order to reflect finite - temperature properties at temperatures between @xmath175 an @xmath176 .",
    "clearly , the level densities are shited too much to lower energies by the residual interaction we considered .",
    "shell - model monte - carlo calculations with a more realistic interaction , but in a limited model space ( the @xmath177 shell ) , result in a better agreement with the backshifted bethe formula at energies between 5 and 20 mev @xcite .    figure [ figurelevel2 ] compares the level density for the largest model space with the level density for the mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "for the mean - field case , the level density can be calculated exactly using a monte - carlo method devised by cerf @xcite .",
    "we performed such a calculation for the largest model space in order to compare it with the saddle - point approximation .",
    "for this largest model space , the saddle - point results follow closely the exact level density at high energies . at lower energies",
    ", the exact level density shows a structure with a lot of peaks , because of the discrete structure of the spectrum . in the saddle - point approximations these peaks",
    "are absent . if these peaks are smeared out with a width of 0.5 mev , the curve coincides with the saddle - point approximation even at excitation energies as low as 1 mev .",
    "thus the saddle - point approximation gives a good smoothed estimate .",
    "in the smaller model spaces the agreement is less good .",
    "figure [ figurelevel2 ] shows that the residual interaction shifts level densities to lower energies .",
    "this shift is largest at low energies , because there the pairing correlations are strongest .",
    "we conclude by stating that our quantum monte - carlo method offers a powerful tool for the study of the nuclear pairing model . we have put emphasis on the thermodynamical properties .",
    "occupation numbers and the pairing gap can be calculated too using this method .",
    "main advantages over other methods are that many - body correlations are taken into account exactly , particle numbers are constant and finite temperature results can be obtained .",
    "the major disadvantage of the method is that spectroscopic information can only be obtained indirectly . finally , we remark that our calculations indicate that pairing correlations are important only at low temperature ( below @xmath149 ) and at low excitation energies , though they do enhance the binding energy .",
    "a signal of a phase transition related to pairing is found at temperatures around @xmath178 .",
    "the pairing interaction also shifts the level density towards lower energies .",
    "furthermore our results show that it is necessary to work in very large model spaces , that also include core excitations , if one wants to calculate accurate level densities .",
