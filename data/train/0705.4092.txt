    "parameters likely responsible for the evolution in @xmath122 with redshift are _",

    "( ii ) _ a larger mass fraction of the post - starburst population at higher redshifts ( we established in section  [ ln : ssp ] that metallicity has a smaller effect on @xmath122 ) .",

    "it is hard to imagine that post - starburst populations in ye galaxies at higher redshift ( be it induced by galaxy interactions or by ram - pressure stripping ) would be systematically younger than in low - redshift ones , given the short duration of the ye phenomenon relative to the difference in look - back times within this redshift range .  in the adopted wmap cosmology",
    ", the difference in look - back times between @xmath127 and 1.0 is @xmath128 gyr , significantly longer than the duration of the ye phenomenon .",
    "instead , one would expect the ages of such post - starburst populations to be randomly distributed ( between 0.5 and 1.5 gyr ) at any redshift .",
    "we , therefore , suggest that it is more likely that the increase of ye candidates @xmath122 with redshift is primarily due to an _ increasing mass fraction of the post - starburst population_.  if indeed the ye phenomenon identifies an important era in the assembly history of early - type galaxies , the lack of low - luminosity ( @xmath129 ) ye candidates at @xmath130 in our goods sample would constitute strong evidence in favor of galaxy formation scenarios in which more massive early - type galaxies in the field are assembled earlier than their low - mass counterparts , which is in line with the  downsizing  picture ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , we currently can not exclude the possibility that the higher - redshift ye candidates do not actually host a ( one ) post - starburst population , but instead have systematically younger overall ( luminosity - weighted ) ages than the lower - redshift ye candidates .",
    "more frequent bursts at higher redshifts , due to more frequent mergers , might be a possible explanation , which would lead to systematically younger observed ages .  given the relevance of this issue in terms of its power to constrain early - type galaxy formation scenarios , we suggest a spectroscopic followup to test whether our ye candidates really do contain k+a features in their spectra .",

    "the morphology bias prevents a direct comparison between the ye fractions in the cluster and field environment .",
    "we , therefore , select only early - type galaxies from our sample and investigate the ye fraction in the field .",
    "a similar trend of an increasing post - starburst fraction with decreasing galaxy luminosity is present in our goods sample of field galaxies .",
    "we quantify this trend by splitting the data at @xmath0 along the pure luminosity evolution vector and counting the number of passive es and ye candidates .",
