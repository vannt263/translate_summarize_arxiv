    "dense and young star clusters are rather rare in our galaxy .",
    "the six such star clusters that are currently known are : arches @xcite , irs13 and irs16 @xcite , ngc3603 , quintuplet @xcite and westerlund  1 @xcite .",
    "the two irs sources , however , can hardly be called a cluster as they look more like the debris of disrupted star cluster @xcite .",
    "young and dense star clusters ( hereafter ydc , sometimes pronounced as yodec ) are characterized by a stellar population which is younger than about 10myr .",
    "the fact that these clusters are young means that stars of all masses are still present , offering critical insights into the stellar initial mass function and cluster structural properties at formation .",
    "the term `` dense '' means that dynamical evolution and physical collisional processes can operate fast enough to compete with and even overwhelm stellar evolutionary timescales ; dense stellar systems are places where wholly new stellar evolution channels can occur , allowing the formation of stellar species completely inaccessible by standard stellar and binary evolutionary pathways .",
    "there are no examples of the older ( @xmath1myr ) siblings of these clusters in the milky way galaxy . for the arches and quintuplet",
    "this may not be so surprising , as they dissolve in the tidal field of the galaxy in at most a few tens of million years @xcite , and even if they survive longer they will become hard to detect against the dense background stellar population @xcite .",
    "for the two rather isolated clusters , ngc3603 and westerlund  1 , it is rather curious that there are no examples of their 10 to 100myr descendants in the milky way .",
    "the other characteristic of ydcs is the high density .",
    "the few clusters near the galactic center must have a high density , as otherwise they would be disrupted easily by the strong tidal field .",
    "the clusters further out however , do not have this constraint and it is interesting to note that clearly these clusters ware born without much knowledge of the local potential of the galaxy , i.e : they behave as isolated clusters .    in this paper , we discuss the formation and evolution of gravitational wave sources in the form of compact binaries in ydcs , but for convenience we extend our definition to star clusters of 100myr .",
    "the basis of this study is the star cluster mgg11 @xcite at about 200pc from the nucleus of the starburst galaxy m82 at a distance of about 3.6mpc .",
    "the star cluster mgg-11 has an age of about 712myr @xcite , a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath2 and a projected half - light radii , @xmath3pc .",
    "the cluster mass then totals @xmath4 .",
    "the cluster mass function seems to be deficient of stars below about 1 , but follow a salpeter slope for the higher masses .",
    "we simulate this cluster by integrating the equations of motion for all stars and follow the evolution of stars and binaries in the cluster using the starlabstarlab/ ] @xcite direct n - body package .",
    "we start our simulations with 144179 stars , 13107 of which are in binaries totaling a binary fraction of about 10% .",
    "the binary parameters ware selected as follows : first we chose a random binding energy between a minimum of 10kt and a maximum , and we chose the orbital eccentricity from the thermal distribution .",
    "the maximum binding energy was selected such that the distance at pericenter exceeded four times the radius of the primary star .",
    "for the initial density profile we adopt a king model with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we ignored an external tidal field , but stars are removed from the simulation if they are more than 10 tidal radii ( about 80pc ) away from the density center of the cluster .",
    "driven by the massive stars , the cluster experiences an early core collapse @xcite , which leads to subsequent collisions between massive stars .",
    "the result of this is the growth of one of the initially most massive stars through repeated collisions , to a total mass of about 1000 - 3000 .",
    "the evolution of the mass of this _ designated target _ is illustrated in figure[fig : mbh_all ] , where we show the range in masses acquired by the star that experiences repeated collisions . in the end the massive star may collapse to an intermediate mass black hole @xcite ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; miller & hamilton 2002 ; madau & rees 2001 ) . .",
    "] .    in a recent model hopman",
    "@xcite proposed that an intermediate mass black hole can capture a companion star in a tight orbit .",
    "further tidal interaction between the black hole and the captured star then circularize the orbit .",
    "they further assume that the captured star is on the main - sequence , but the same argument can be made for evolved stars . by the time the orbit has been fully circularized the captured star under - fills its roche - lobe only slightly . during the remainder of the main - sequence lifetime of the captured star , it grows in size by about a factor of two and",
    "gravitational wave radiation reduces the orbital separation .",
    "ultimately the star fills its roche lobe and starts to transfer mass to the intermediate mass black hole .",
    "we do not further consider the details of tidal capture , nor do we assess the probability of forming the type of binary systems discussed in this paper , as we mainly concentrate on the phase in the lifetime of the intermediate mass black hole at which it is visible as a source for gravitational waves .",
    "after tidal capture we evolved the binary through various stages using the binary evolution code of eggleton ( pols et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) , assuming a population i chemical composition ( y = 0.98 , z = 0.02 ) , mixing - length parameter of @xmath6 and with convective overshooting constant @xmath7 ( pols et al . 1998 ) .",
    "results on such evolution are published by portegies zwart et al @xcite .",
    "they calculated the orbital evolution of the binary systems , as they are affected by the emission of gravitational waves ( landau & lifshitz , 1958 ) , roche - lobe overflow and by non - conservative mass transfer or by mass loss via a wind ( soberman et al .",
    "matter was assumed to leaves the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor . during mass - transfer the black hole",
    "was assumed to accrete matter up to its eddington limit ( see e.g. king 2000 ) .",
    "the binary emits gravitational waves , and as long as the stars are far apart we can assume that they behave as point masses .",
    "note , however , that the donor star fills its roche - lobe and can hardly be described as a point mass .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal is given by ( evens et al .",
    "1987 ) @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the chirp mass .",
    "the gravitational wave frequency is twice the orbital frequency .",
    "the resulting gravitational wave signal is presented in fig.[fig : gwr_cluster ] , for binaries which started roche - lobe overflow on the zero - age main - sequence .",
    "binaries which do not stars rlof during the main - sequence phase of the donor will not become detectable gravitational wave sources .",
    "at the onset of roche - lobe overflow the wave strain is @xmath10 for a 1000 black hole with a @xmath11 roche - lobe filling main - sequence companion at a distance of 1kpc .",
    "while mass transfer proceeds the binary system becomes wider , resulting in a increase of the orbital period and consequently in a decrease of the wave strain .",
    "a binary at a distance of @xmath12kpc is then visible for about 1/10@xmath13 of its main - sequence lifetime , which , for an @xmath11 donor is at most a few million years .",
    "figure[fig : gwr_cluster ] shows the expectation of the lisa noise curve ( diagonal solid curve from top left to bottom right .",
    "sources to the right and above this curve are expected to be detectable by the lisa satellite .",
    "main - sequence stars of 5 and 15 which ware born in roche lobe contact to a 1000 black hole are visible between the two diagonal dashed curves , assuming a distance of 1kpc .",
    "note that the star cluster westerlund1 is at a distance of 1.1kpc .",
    "the @xmath14 donors turn into a white dwarfs after their entire hydrogen envelope has been transferred to the black hole . after that",
    ", the emission of gravitational waves brings the two stars back into the relatively high frequency regime and it becomes detectable again for the _ lisa _ antennae .",
    "this process , however takes far longer than a hubble time , unless the orbit has an eccentricity @xmath15 .",
    "such high eccentricities , after the phase of mass transfer , can only be achieved in the cases where the donor collapses to a compact object in a supernova explosion , or if the binary is perturbed by external influences .",
    "note that the kick velocity due to a possible asymmetry in the supernova in which the neutron star forms is not sufficient to unbind the binary system . the supernova may induce a high eccentricity , leading to a relatively quick merger due to the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "such a post - supernova system can be seem by lisa over a much larger distance , enhancing the available volume within which such event can occur .",
    "we conclude that the here discussed class of binaries with relatively massive donors @xmath16 in a state of roche - lobe contact are probably not important sources of gravitational waves , because this phase is short lived and the gravitational wave radiation emitted is relatively weak .",
    "if the donor collapses to a neutron star , however , the binary can be seen to a much larger distance and this may result in an appreciable detection rate .",
    "the binary in which a 2 main - sequence star starts to transfer mass to a 1000 black hole , however , remains visible as a bright source of gravitational waves for its entire lifetime ( see figure[fig : gwr_cluster ] ) .",
    "the reason for this striking result is the curious evolution of the donor . during rlof ,",
    "the hydrogen content in the star is continuously fully mixed , and as a consequence the star remains rather small in size , causing the mass transfer rate to remains roughly constant . by the time the hydrogen fraction drops below @xmath17 , the central temperature becomes so low that thermonuclear fusion stops : this happens at about @xmath18myr . at that point",
    "the system is detached for about 8myr before it undergoes another phase of mass transfer until @xmath19gyr , at which point the donor turns into a 0.011 ( about 10 @xmath20 ) brown dwarf .",
    "the brown dwarf ultimately merges with the black hole due to the emission of gravitational - waves @xcite .",
    "this binary remains visible in the lisa frequency regime for its entire lifetime , only the gravitational wave strain drops as the donor is slowly consumed by the intermediate mass black hole .",
    "mass transfer in this evolutionary stage is rather slow causing the x - ray source to be transient , being bright for a few days every other month .",
    "we argue that such a transient could result in an interesting synchronous detection of x - rays and gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the solid curve in the middle of the diagram gives the gravitational wave radiation emitted by a 2 star transferring mass to a 1000 black hole .",
    "this binary has a rather peculiar evolution @xcite .",
    "such binaries may remain visible in x - rays and as a source of gravitational waves for their entire main - sequence lifetime .",
    "the gravitational waves , however will only be visible by the lisa antennae do a distance of at most a few kpc .    the other symbols in figure[fig : gwr_cluster ] give the location of the compact binaries in the frequency  strain diagram for the simulated cluster at an age of 100myr .",
    "the large @xmath21 identifies the location of an intermediate mass black hole formed in the simulations , which , at that moment had a mass of about 1130 and had a 1.4 main - sequence star companion in a 0.6day orbit .",
    "this binary was captured by a three - body process .",
    "stellar - mass black holes , neutron stars and white dwarfs are represented in figure[fig : gwr_cluster ] by bullets , large circles and small circles , respectively .",
    "all objects are binaries , and a single large circle therefore represents a binary consisting of two neutron stars , of which there are a couple .",
    "the few large circles with an inner smaller circle ( near @xmath22 and @xmath23 are binaries with a neutron star and a white dwarf .",
    "the majority of objects contain black holes or white dwarfs ; binaries with neutron stars are rare because of the large kick velocities they receive upon birth .",
    "young and dense star clusters are promising sources for gravitational wave radiation .",
    "especially when they get older than @xmath24myr as white dwarf binaries start to form . but also at younger age the presence of an intermediate mass black hole may provide an important source of gravitational waves .",
    "an interesting possibility is provided by a @xmath25 donor which starts to transfer mass to an intermediate mass black hole at birth .",
    "such a binary may be visible as a bright transient x - ray source and simultaneously as gravitational wave source in the _ lisa _ band to a distance of a few kpc .",
    "i am grateful to steve mcmillan and gijs nelemans for numerous discussions , and in particular to jun for the excessive use of his grape-6 , on which these simulations are performed .",
