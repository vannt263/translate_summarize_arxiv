    "matthias ballauff has contributed much insight into this topic by successfully comparing partial structure factors calculated from ornstein - zernike equations with experimentally determined scattering data of dissolved dendrimers @xcite , bottle - brush polymers @xcite , polyelectrolyte brushes @xcite , plate - like colloids @xcite , and nanoparticles @xcite . in these earlier studies",
    "the ornstein - zernike equations have been employed in the study of pair correlations of the dissolved particles . however , due to complex preparation procedures , many fluids contain impurities , which potentially influence the solvent structure factor even in the case of highly diluted impurities @xcite . in the following",
    "we address the problem of how impurities can alter the form of the solvent structure factor . by means of general , model independent arguments based on ornstein - zernike equations",
    "we derive a general asymptotic form of the solvent structure factor .",
    "this form of the solvent structure factor and the insight gained from it is expected to be useful also for the analysis of future studies involving impurities in fluid systems .    in the next sec .",

    "consider a spatially uniform fluid mixture of three components of which component 1 is referred to as the `` solvent '' whereas components 2 and 3 are called `` impurities '' .",
    "the interaction potentials @xmath1 between two particles of components @xmath2 and @xmath3 are assumed to be isotropic and vanishing at infinite particle separation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "note that no particular asymptotic decay of @xmath5 is assumed .",
    "the mole fraction @xmath6 of component @xmath7 may be expressed in terms of the mole fraction @xmath8 of impurities and the composition @xmath9 $ ] of the impurities such that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for _",
    "ionic _ impurities with valencies @xmath13 of the respective components the constraint @xmath14 of local charge neutrality of the bulk fluid leads to the composition @xmath15 , whereas the composition @xmath16 of _ non - ionic _ impurities is not restricted to a particular value .",
    "in general the partial structure factors @xmath17 with @xmath18 of a fluid with total number density @xmath19 are given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ( three - dimensional ) fourier transform of the total correlation function @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 denotes the magnitude of the scattering vector and @xmath24 is the radial distribution function .",
    "as the name implies , the total correlation function @xmath25 gives a complete information about all the correlations between a pair of particles of components @xmath2 and @xmath3 . by considering @xmath17 and @xmath26 as the @xmath27-components of the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and with the diagonal matrix @xmath30",
    "one can rewrite eq .   in the matrix form",

    "the asymptotic behaviour @xmath39 of the fourier transform of the direct correlation function @xmath33 is required .",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath40 with @xmath41 for sufficiently large @xmath42 . hence @xmath43 with @xmath44 being an even entire function of @xmath23 and @xmath45    if @xmath46 one obtains @xmath47 with an even entire function @xmath48 of @xmath23 . however ,",

    "i.e. , @xmath68 , no pole occurs at @xmath63 in eqs .  .",
    "in the absence of impurities , i.e. , for @xmath69 , one obtains the well - known ornstein - zernike structure factor @xmath70 from eqs .   and .",
    "from the relation @xmath71 , which holds due to the fact that @xmath72 is the ratio between the compressibility of the solvent and that of a gas of non - interacting particles of the same temperature and density @xcite , one infers @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , @xmath74 is required if the bulk phase diagram of the pure solvent exhibits critical points and if the pure solvent is uniform throughout the whole one - phase region of the bulk phase diagram , i.e. , @xmath75 for @xmath76 does not diverge even close to critical points . note that these conditions are not fulfilled by a fluid of hard spheres , because there is no critical point in the corresponding bulk phase diagram , which is independent of temperature and exhibits only a first - order phase transition .    inserting eqs .   into eq .   and",
    "considering only the dominant contributions in the mole fraction @xmath57 of impurities leads to the asymptotic form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is related to the compressibility of the solvent @xcite , @xmath79 is the bulk correlation length and @xmath80 is the inverse debye length with @xmath81 denoting the ionic strength . the quantity @xmath82 measures the contrast of impurity - solvent interactions .",
    "hence the normalized solvent structure factor @xmath83 depends on the two dimensionless parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 which are related to material parameters such as @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the form of eq .   has previously been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite within a specific model of electrolyte solutions .",
    "the derivation presented here demonstrates that the asymptotic form eq .   of the solvent structure factor",
    "@xmath75 is independent of any specific model .",
    "the consequences of eqs .   and the physical meaning of the quantity @xmath85 are discussed in the following section .",
    "considering @xmath75 in eq .",
    "one immediately recognizes @xmath88        \\dps",

    "however , ionic impurities due to , e.g. , alkali halides of ionic strength @xmath92 in water at room temperature , i.e. , @xmath93 , lead to a debye length @xmath94 which is much larger than the particle size .",
    "for ionic impurities it is readily seen that @xmath75 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath23 if @xmath95 ( see figs .  [ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) ) . if @xmath96 a maximum of @xmath75 occurs at @xmath97 . in this latter case",
    "@xmath98 is finite for @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ) , whereas @xmath75 has a pole for @xmath100 ( see fig .  [ fig:1](d ) ) . obviously , whenever @xmath96 , a divergence of @xmath75 occurs upon approaching a critical point , where the bulk correlation length @xmath101 diverges .",
    "hence , by adding ionic impurities the solvent remains uniform within the whole one - phase region of the bulk phase diagram if and only if @xmath95 , i.e. , if the contrast of impurity - solvent interactions is sufficiently small .",
    "this can be understood in such a way that a contrast of impurity - solvent interactions ( @xmath102 ) promotes density fluctuations of a particular finite wave length @xmath103 which occur upon approaching a critical point .",
    "the question on the origin of a sufficiently strong contrast of impurity - solvent interactions is addressed in the following subsec .",
    "[ subsec : origin ] .    .",
    "the bulk correlation length is denoted by @xmath101 , whereas the inverse debye length is given by @xmath104 .",
    "the contrast of impurity - solvent interactions is measured by the parameter @xmath105 ( see eq .  ) . for @xmath95 ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) a monotonic structure factor",
    "is found , whereas a non - monotonic behaviour with a maximum close to the debye length @xmath106 occurs for @xmath96 ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . in the latter situation",
    "the maximum diverges at a sufficiently large but finite bulk correlation length ( panel ( d)).,width=321 ]      it has been shown in the previous subsec .",
    "[ subsec : forms ] that deviations from a monotonic ornstein - zernike - like solvent structure factor @xmath75 occur only for _ ionic _ impurities _ and _ for a sufficiently _ large contrast _ of impurity - solvent interactions ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "non - monotonic solvent structure factors have indeed been found in heavy water+3-methylpyridine mixtures in the presence of sodium tetraphenylborate ( @xmath107 ) by means of small - angle neutron scattering @xcite . however , the same solvent under the same conditions with simple salt impurities ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) led to monotonic solvent structure factors @xcite .",
    "this experimental observation implies that the valency of impurity ions are _ not _ expected to be the origin for impurity - induced non - uniformities of the solvent . in agreement with this , it has recently been concluded within a theoretical model @xcite that neither the valency nor differences in solubility give rise to a sufficiently large parameter @xmath96 .",
    "here it is proposed that @xmath96 may be reached due to steric effects , i.e. , due to the property of ( ionic ) impurities being structure - makers or structure - breakers . for spherical particles",
    "@xmath113 and @xmath114 can be expected , where @xmath115 denotes the extension of a particle of component @xmath2 . hence , according to eq .  , @xmath96 may be reached for impurities of significantly different particle sizes such as @xmath116 and @xmath117 ^ -}$ ] , whereas @xmath118 for particles of similar size like simple salts .",
    "non - monotonic solvent structure factors can be measured using small - angle neutron or x - ray scattering in view of the aforementioned typical debye length @xmath106 and @xmath119 . in the case of highly diluted impurities the functional shape of the measured scattering intensity",
    "is dominated by the solvent structure factor .",
    "it is important to understand that it is not the valency but the long - ranged character ( @xmath120 ) of electrostatic interactions of the impurities which gives rise to the relevance of the parameter @xmath105 for the formation of a non - uniform solvent structure .",
    "however , whether the solvent becomes non - uniform upon adding ionic impurities is mainly determined by the size - differences between the impurity particles .",
    "by means of general , model independent properties of the direct correlation functions it has been shown that dilute impurities may influence the structure of a solvent if and only if they are composed of ions with a sufficiently large contrast of impurity - solvent interactions .",
    "it has been argued that the latter feature requires significantly different particle sizes .",
    "non - ionic impurities or ions of similar size are not expected to give rise to a qualitative change in the large - scale structure of the solvent .",
    "ionic impurities with a sufficiently strong impurity - solvent interaction contrast lead to a non - monotonic solvent structure factor with a maximum at a magnitude of the scattering vector close to the inverse debye length ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . upon approaching a critical point ,",
    "this maximum height diverges at a finite bulk correlation length , which corresponds to the formation of a non - uniform bulk fluid .    for fluids with dilute impurities the asymptotic form of the structure factor derived here ( see eq .  ) is expected to be a useful generalization of the standard ornstein - zernike form , because additional information on the impurity - solvent interactions can be extracted ( see eq .  ) .",
    "application in future experimental studies on such systems would be highly welcome in order to test the derived expression further .",
    "finally , the ornstein - zernike approach can be applied to multicomponent impurities , i.e. , @xmath121 ."
