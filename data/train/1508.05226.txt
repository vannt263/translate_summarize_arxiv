    "blood glucose levels are controlled by a complex interaction of multiple chemicals and hormones in the body .",

    "the resultant rise in intracellular @xmath2 concentration in the @xmath0-cell triggers insulin secretion .",

    "physiological responses generated within a cell can propagate to neighboring cells through intercellular communication involving the passage of a molecular signal to a bordering cell through a gap junction @xcite , through extracellular communication involving the secretion of molecular signals @xcite such as hormones , neurotransmitters , etc .",
    ", and also trough extracellular calcium signaling @xcite",
    ". oscillations of @xmath2 rather than metabolism in the @xmath0-cell are thought to be the direct cause of these oscillations in insulin secretion @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite proposed a dynamical model of such oscillations , which assume gap junction diffusion of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate between adjacent cells .",
    "the diffusion of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate between cells then initiate not only @xmath2 oscillations but also insulin oscillations in adjacent cells .",
    "it is well known that the dynamics of the insulin is very relevant because it is related to the onset of the pathologies such as diabetes caused by elevated blood glucose .",
    "careful diabetes mellitus self - management is essential in avoiding chronic complications that compromise health , and is characterized by many and often not readily observable clinical effects @xcite . along the same line",
    ", attention has been paid with the increased emphasis on derangements of the sensitivity of tissues to insulin in diverse pathological conditions like diabetes , obesity and cardiovascular diseases @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic methods that provide more precise clinical assessments and sensitive detection of symptoms at earlier stage of the disease .",
    "this may be facilitated by improved mathematical models and tools related to interrelationship dynamics among physiological variables implicated in the glucose - insulin system .",
    "this assumption motivates the present work , where a diffusive model of coupled pancreatic islet @xmath0-cells is investigated .",
    "the cells are connected via the gap junction coupling which consists of a mechanism used by cells to coordinate and synchronize their information @xcite .",
    "we then investigate a clear analytical solution describing the dynamics of insulin in the system . by means of the multiple scale expansion in the semi - discrete approximation",
    ", we use the linard form of a diffusive system to obtain the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation , which describes the evolution of modulated waves in this system .",
    "we obtain an expression of the hormonal wave by using of the envelope soliton solution of the cgl by pereira and stenflo @xcite , and nozaki and bekki @xcite .",
    "the solution reveal that the hormonal wave is a localized nonlinear solution which propagates in the form of a breather - like coherent structure .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we present the mathematical model . in section  [ sec3 ] , we find an envelope soliton in the model by applying the multiple scale expansion in the semi - discrete approximation .",

    "we propose in this paper a diffusive model of coupled pancreatic islet @xmath0-cells , in which the cells are connected via the gap junction coupling .",
    "diffusive cell models with gap junction coupling are quite interesting in describing and characterizing quasi - perfect intercellular communication @xcite . for the mathematical modeling ,",

    "the parameter @xmath10 is the rate constant which represents insulin - independent glucose disappearance , @xmath11 is the rate constant which represents insulin - dependent glucose disappearance . in other terms , @xmath11 describes the modulation of the effective kinetic constant of the glucose utilization by insulin action .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the glucose infusion rate , @xmath13 is the rate constant which represents insulin production due to glucose stimulation and @xmath14 is the rate constant which represents insulin degradation .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is the coupling strength of the gap junction .",
    "we have considered two nearest neighbors coupling in a weak coupling regime .",
    "a weak coupling between neighboring cells is a situation that arises in the study of bursting activity in the @xmath0-cell islets of the pancreas , which secrete insulin in response to glucose level @xcite .",
    "the model also predicts that oscillations occur if there is sufficient diffusion ( @xmath16 ) to create adequate concentrations mixing in the reacting layers of the cells @xcite .",
    "note that the model is nonlinear , due to the presence of the bilinear term between the internal variable @xmath17 representing the insulin action and the variable @xmath18 representing in the first equation the glucose concentration .",
    "the parameter values chosen are those from the literature of healthy volunteer undergoing the intra venous glucose tolerance test . in a clinical experiment conducted and reported in ref .",

    "this is achieved by differentiating the second equation and substituting @xmath3 into the obtained second - order ordinary differential equation .",
    "the above transformations did not fundamentally affect the structure of the system , but allow us to conveniently write eqs . and in a linard form that is a second - order differential equation with a small damping term .",

    "we have studied the intercellular insulin dynamics in an array of diffusively coupled pancreatic islet @xmath0-cells .",

    "motivated with often non - observance clinical effects due to some pathological diseases @xcite , the work was devoted to derive a clear analytical solution describing the insulin dynamics in pancreatic islet @xmath0-cells . applying a powerful perturbation technique ,",
    "we have found that the complex ginzburg - landau equation is the equation which describes the insulin dynamics .",
    "it has been revealed that the solution of the hormonal wave is well a localized modulated solitonic wave called breather . in another regard , the breather has been revealed as mechanically important in other biophysical systems such as collagen @xcite , dna @xcite , microtubule @xcite systems .",
    "the correlation with the present work may indicate an important role of breathers and other nonlinear excitations in the dynamics of pancreatic islet @xmath0-cells . in a forthcoming work ,",

    "<S> , we show that the insulin dynamics can be governed by the complex ginzburg - landau equation . </S>",
    "<S> the localized solutions of this equation are reported . </S>",
