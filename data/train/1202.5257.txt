    ", writes : `` if a physicist finds a contradiction between two theories that are equally dear to him , he will sometimes say : do not worry about this ; the intermediate links of the chain may be hidden from us , but we will strongly hold onto its ends ''  @xcite .",
    "beginning with the creation of satellites and experiments in the absence of the gravitational field of earth , a new period in physical experimental investigations of thermodynamical phenomena began .",
    "for example , in an equilibrium state , the liquid will have the form of a spherical drop .",
    "it should be noted that previously the relevant experiments were carried out on the surface of the earth , and hence were subjected to gravitational attraction .",
    "therefore , the coagulating drops fell to the ground and the liquid was underneath and the gas above .",
    "coagulation of drops occurs , in particular , because of the earth s gravity .    on the other hand ,",
    "computer - aided experiments have been developed so greatly that a new science arose , the so - called molecular dynamics .",
    "significant changes also occurred in the mathematical sciences .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that great progress was also made in such a science as thermodynamics .",
    "the difficulty is that everybody is used to the old thermodynamics based on the boltzmann distribution .",
    "mathematical theorems imply some other distributions , and no contradictions are admissible in mathematics .",
    "therefore , one should not hold on to the end corresponding to the old thermodynamics based on the boltzmann distribution . as for the gibbs distribution for the gibbs ensemble",

    "*      in his 1903 treatise `` la science et lhypothse , '' henri poincar  ( @xcite , chap ,  11 ) closely connects probability theory with problems in thermodynamics .",
    "in particular , he writes : `` has probability been defined ? can it even be defined ? and if it can not , how can we venture to reason upon it ?",
    "the definition , it will be said , is very simple .",
    "the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to the event to the total number of possible cases  we are  bound to complete the definition by saying , ``  to the total number of possible cases , provided the cases are equally probable . ''",
    "so we are compelled to define the probable by the probable . ",
    "the conclusion which seems to follow from this is that the calculus of probabilities is a useless science , that the obscure instinct which we call common - sense , and to which we appeal for the legitimization of our conventions , must be distrusted . ''",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", poincar speaks of the principles of thermodynamics , the laws of boyle  mariotte and gay  lussac , and clausius approach to molecular physics .",
    "poincar writes : `` i may also mention the celebrated theory of errors of observation , to which i shall return later ; the kinetic theory of gases , a well - known hypothesis wherein each gaseous molecule is supposed to describe an extremely complicated path , but in which , through the effect of great numbers , the mean phenomena which are all eve observe obey the simple laws of mariotte and gay  lussac .",
    "all these theories are based upon the laws of great numbers , and the calculus of probabilities would evidently involve them in its ruin . ''",
    "@xcite .    certainly , poincar gave the standard definition of probability as the ratio of the number of cases favorable for the event to the total number of possible events and gave a counterexample to this definition of probability .",
    "this definition must be completed , writes poincar , by the sentence `` under the assumption that these cases are equiprobable '' ( @xcite ) and notes that we have completed a vicious circle place by defining probability via probability .",
    "after this , poincar writes : `` the conclusion which seems to follow from this is that the calculus of probabilities is a useless science , that the obscure instinct which we call common sense , and to which we appeal for the legitimization of our conventions , must be distrusted . ''",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the problem is to define first of all what cases are to be regarded as equiprobable in the most natural way .",
    "`` we are to look for a mathematical thought , '' writes poincar , `` where it remains pure , i.e. , in arithmetic '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "kolmogorov s definition of elementary events which can be taken for a `` complete family of equiprobable events '' is based on intuition , i.e. , on `` the obscure instinct which we call common - sense , '' see above .",
    "kolmogorov s theory , and especially the concept of independent events , well agrees with the boltzmann distribution .",
    "kolmogorov s probability theory gave way to a wide spectrum of applications .",
    "a new conception of thermodynamics , which differs from the boltzmann distribution , must lead to a new conception of probability theory , and especially to a new interpretation of the notion of independent variables .",
    "thus , poincar , a great mathematician , who became the chairman of the theory of probability at the university of paris ( the sorbonne ) at the young age of 32 , considers the possibility `` that the calculus of probabilities is a useless science '' and rejects the idea that `` this calculus '' is to `` be condemned , '' in particular , because of thermodynamics ( and `` the kinetic theory of gases '' ) . since we have constructed a new thermodynamics , the idea arises to construct a new probability theory corresponding to this thermodynamics in such a way that the notion of independent events would correspond to the new kolmogorov s conception , namely , to complexity theory , rather than the old notion corresponding to the boltzmann distribution .",
    "first of all , in kolmogorov s theory , the passage to the limit with respect to the number @xmath0 of independent tests is of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the number of cases favorable for the event , as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . and ,",
    "if the expectation @xmath5 of the family @xmath6 is given before the passage to the limit with respect to the number of tests , then we can write @xmath7 denote @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "let us take into account that the numbers @xmath9 and @xmath0 are large",
    ".    consider the simplest case @xmath10 , @xmath11 i hope there will be no confusion if we shall omit the prime .    in the problem known under the title `` partitio numerorum ''   ( see example  5 below ) , we may consider all versions of partitioning a number  @xmath5 into  @xmath0 summands as equiprobable events , provided that @xmath12 .",
    "for example , we may assume that the partitions of the number 5 into the sum 1 + 4 and into the sum 2 + 3 are equiprobable .",
    "here we undertake an essential deviation from the kolmogorov probability ; however , we approach poincar s point of view concerning arithmetic .",
    "the question is , what are specific problems to which the new probability theory can be applied ?",
    "kolmogorov  @xcite writes : `` the probability approach is natural in the theory of transmission , over communication channels , of `` mass '' information consisting of many disconnected or weakly connected messages subjected to certain probability laws . in problems of this kind , the confusion of probabilities and frequencies within the limits of a single sufficiently long time series ( this confusion can rigorously be justified under the conjecture of a rather fact mixing ) , which is deep - rooted in applied researches , is also practically harmless . '' ",
    "`` if there is still some dissatisfaction , it is related to a certain vagueness of our conceptions dealing with relationships between the mathematical probability theory and practical `` random phenomena '' in general . ''",
    "the new probability theory corresponding to the new conception of thermodynamics must adequately describe situations ( for example , in computer simulation ) with many agents , and also for the case in which the analysis involves `` people . ''",
    "this theory must meet the requirements of semiotics when the number of symbols is very large .",
    "this theory must be related to the zipf law and to similar laws , and also must be applicable to stock exchange speculation ( see  @xcite ) . as we shall see below",
    ", the velocity of money and the occurrence and repayment of debts are also related to problems of new probability theory .",
    "introduction of an additional parameter  @xmath0 in the probability theory is very essential , although it finally tends to infinity , @xmath3 . in particular",
    ", it follows from the principle of lagrange undetermined multipliers that , in the process of calculation of the entropy maximum , the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath5 are associated with the following two parameters : the chemical potential  @xmath13 and the inverse temperature @xmath14 , where  @xmath15 is the temperature .",
    "thus , the `` number of measurements ''  @xmath0 is associated with a new parameter  @xmath13 , which must play a key role in the new probability theory .",

    "    4truecm``_the forgotten legacy of gdel and einstein _ '' p.  yourgrau    there is a famous dictum of kronecker , one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century : _ `` the natural numbers are from god , all the rest is the handiwork of man . ''",
    "_ in the paper",
    "`` on the dogma of the natural numbers '' [ uspekhi mat .",
    "nauk , * 28 * ( 4 ) , 243246 ( 1973 ) , in russian ] , p.  k.  rashevskii [ rashevsky ] wrote : : `` the famous negative results of gdel in the thirties are founded on the belief that , however long you continue the construction of mathematical formulas for a given ( totally formalized ) mathematical theory , the principles of counting and ordering the formulas remain ordinary , i.e. , subjected to the scheme of natural series . certainly , this belief was not even explicitly stipulated , because it was assumed to be obvious to this very extent . ''    recall that gdel s `` negative results '' ( the impossibility of proving the consistency of arithmetic by means of arithmetic or any formal theory containing arithmetic ) destroyed the foundation of hilbert s program for constructing all of mathematics as a completely formalized system .",
    "indeed , it follows from gdel s incompleteness theorem that any formal system containing the natural number series ( i.e. , containing its usual axiomatization ) is flawed in principle : if it is consistent , it must be incomplete , since it must contain true arithmetical statements that can neither be formally proved nor disproved .",
    "the analysis of the constructions of the great gdel shows that these arithmetical statements are related , via the principle of mathematical induction , to extremely large numbers .",
    "it is well known that hilbert , after the incompleteness of any noncontradictory formal theory containing arithmetic was proved , fell into a prolonged depression .",
    "the author conjectures that gdel s theorem leads to the explanation of several paradoxes of thermodynamics , provided one makes use of an additional instrument , for instance , of a measuring device .",
    "let us present a few elementary examples .",
    "already in the 4th century b. c. , the greek philosopher eubulides of miletus formulated the sandpile paradox : beginning with what number of grains of sand can their collection be regarded as a pile ?",
    "first let us comment on this question .",
    "\\1 . when a pile of sand is measured , instead of counting the grains , one ordinarily uses a spoon , or a cup , or some weighting device , and any other arithmetic averaging as well .",
    "when such a measurement is performed , precision is lost : the spoons are filled with a number of grains of sand known only approximately , only up to several grains .",
    "the first factor results in the appearance of a new arithmetic for the subsets of the given set of grains , i.e. , one more mapping of the subsets of the given set to the set of natural numbers .",
    "the second factor leads to a small loss of precision , to so - called `` fluctuations '' or , from the mathematical point of view , to `` fuzzy sets '' or `` soft sets . ''",
    "what fluctuations are admissible ?",
    "consider the simple example of a cup of tea into which we have mixed a spoonful of sugar .",
    "we  wait for the liquid in the cup to stop rotating , to become calm , but still remain hot .",
    "this means that we allow some fluctuation of the liquid ; otherwise , it will cool off .",
    "the less fluctuations are allowed , the colder the tea will become and the longer we will have to wait before beginning to drink our tea . if the fluctuations are already admissible from our point of view , we say that the tea has been calmed .",
    "( this process is quite similar to passing from nonequilibrium thermodynamics to equilibrium thermodynamics , in which only fairly small fluctuations are allowed . )    already in the second half of the 20th century , mathematicians have attempted to carry out a _ reform _ of the natural numbers from the point of view of `` fuzzy sets,''``interval analysis , '' `` nonstandard analysis , '' and the like  @xcite@xcite ; see also  @xcite . to use the language of physics , this involves taking fluctuations into consideration .",
    "one can modify kronecker s statement in the following way : _ god created air _ , and therefore created the avogadro and the loschmidt numbers , i.e. , quantities from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , and also the unavoidable fluctuations of air .",
    "this implies the practical impossibility of calculating such quantities exactly .    in his famous work `` what is life ( from the point of view of physics ) ? ''",
    "schrdinger put forward the hypothesis that if the number of particles @xmath0 is large enough , then we can not obtain a calculation result with precision better than @xmath18 . and",
    "schrdinger called this a `` law of nature . ''",
    "more precisely , in mathematical terms , this can be expressed by saying that the probability of an error in the calculation of  @xmath0 being greater than @xmath18 is sufficiently small .",
    "we call this a `` soft set '' of  @xmath0 elements",
    "s `` law of nature '' contradicts the dogma ( axioms ) of the natural numbers .",
    "thus , first of all , a sandpile is a soft set , with the important properties that ( 1 ) it presents another mapping ( of its subsets ) to the natural numbers and ( 2 ) it possesses admissible fluctuations .    finally , let us pass to the main property of the sandpile , which consists in the following .",
    "if we interchange two grains of sand in the pile , then it remains the same pile , i.e. , the concept will not change and the rules of its arithmetic will not change .",
    "this means that although the grains of sand are different ( they can be distinguished by a scrupulous study ) , within the sandpile they lose their individuality . and",
    "therefore , in the pile they do not obey the boltzmann statistics , but a statistics of the bose ",
    "einstein type .",
    "for example , if we buy a pound of sugar , the calculation of the exact number of grains of sugar is not only extremely difficult , but also has no practical meaning .",
    "however our `` pile '' of sugar can be divided into two half kilo piles or into ten piles of 100 grams each .",
    "the addition and multiplication for them remain . in other words , for piles the rules of arithmetic still hold .",
    "the scale is determined by a macro - measuring device ( for example , by a balance with weights ; we assume for the sake of simplicity of our presentation that there is also a minimal weight ) .",
    "let us repeat once again : if , under the interchange of two grains , the notion of pile does not change , and neither do the rules of arithmetic for piles , then the individuality of particles of sand within the pile are lost .",
    "this is the main property of piles . from the point of view of statistical physics",
    ", this corresponds to passing from boltzmann statistics ( from the boltzmann entropy , which is equal to the shannon entropy ) to a one - parameter family of statistics of the bose ",
    "einstein type , although grains of sand _ can be distinguished from each other _ and there are no identical grains .",
    "[ exam2 ] let us put two one - copeck coins in two banks and calculate the number of possible variants of this decomposition .",
    "\\(1 ) we put two coins in the first bank and nothing in the second one .",
    "\\(2 ) we put two coins in the second bank and nothing in the first one .",
    "\\(3 ) we put per one coin in each bank .",
    "thus , we have three variants .",
    "this is the bose - type statistics ) . ] .",
    "now we calculate the number of possible variants of putting a one - copeck coin and a one - pence coin in two banks . in this case , variant  ( 3 ) splits into the following two variants : we put the copeck in the first bank and the pence in the second bank or we put the pence in the first bank and the copeck in the second bank . as a result , we have four possible variants .",
    "this is the boltzmann statistics .",
    "similarly , the decomposition of @xmath5 copeck coins over @xmath0 banks gives the bose - type statistics .",
    "if you put a 1000-rouble bond on your bank account and then want to take it back , it is hardly probable that you obtain the same 1000-rouble bond ( with the same number ) .",
    "quite similarly , the conveyance of @xmath5 loaves of bread from a big baker s shop over @xmath0 bakeries satisfies the bose - type statistics .",
    "but the variety of proposed loaves , the purchaser in a bakery can choose a certain loaf that he likes most of all .",
    "these situations are determined by the words  wholesale  ( i.e. vegetables and fruit are measured in containers , e.g. in barrels with volume @xmath19 ) and `` at retail '' .",
    "this is an example of the `` sandpile '' paradox : while the set of elements is treated as a pile , its elements are subjectively indistinguishable and satisfy the bose - type statistics . in our case",
    ", it is meaningful to distinguish the elements of the set , then this is already not a pile , and it satisfies the boltzmann statistics .",
    "if we consider a set of grains before the formation of a pile ( i.e. , before the time moment at which the set can be measured by a macroscopic device ) , then the transposition of grains gives another natural series as compared with the original one .",
    "if we continue extending the new natural number series according to boltzmann , the difference between the statistics will disappear .",
    "this is similar to the one - parameter family of hyperbolic geometries whose curvature vanishes as they become euclidean .",
    "let us cover the actual ( practical ) natural series by a system of soft subsets of @xmath0 elements , which meet one another in the domain of fluctuations in general .",
    "it is assumed that the union of these subsets contains the entire natural series and that @xmath20 .",
    "the union of pairs of subsets of @xmath21 elements contains the natural series again and , continuing the process of adding a new pile , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , ",
    ", we obtain an arithmetic of soft subsets and a practical natural series of piles .",
    "we would like to say in advance that equilibrium thermodynamics is related to these very deep logical problems .",
    "if we supplement the dogma of the natural numbers with an external measuring device without denying the commutativity of addition , this will not contradict the fact that we are counting only up to some precision , and if probability is taken into consideration , will allow counting up to some given `` soft '' precision .",
    "this soft precision allows to count all the elements of a finite set .",
    "we are only saying that if this unprecise count differs from the exact one , then we can disregard the error .",
    "the so - called equal distribution law only concerns small natural numbers .",
    "this law must also be modified . and",
    "this contradicts our habitual philosophy , accepted for centuries , and can therefore generate protests not only from scientists , but also from philosophers .",
    "progressive russian men of letters , for example , chernyshevskii , categorically refused to accept lobachevsky s geometry .",
    "note that lobachevskian geometry is in fact a one - parameter family of geometries , depending on the radius ( curvature ) , which passes to euclidean geometry as the radius tends to infinity .",
    "soviet philosophers ostracized the followers of bohr s complementarity principle , which he borrowed from biology and psychology . at the same time , if we accept this complementarity principle as a `` complement '' to the new concept of the number @xmath0 of particles with admissible fluctuations of @xmath18 , then we come to the notion of chemical potential  @xmath13 and to an assertion similar to heisenberg s indeterminacy principle : the smaller the fluctuations of  @xmath13 , the smaller the fluctuations of  @xmath0 . and , further , we come to other intensive and extensive quantities that characterize thermodynamics .    first of all , the pressure @xmath24 exercised by the piston decreases the volume @xmath25 of air in the vessel , and bohr s complementarity principle relates these two substances .",
    "the increase of the temperature @xmath15 increases the chaotic speed of particles , it increases the chaos determined by the entropy .",
    "these two quantities correspond by bohr s complementarity principle .",
    "bohr s complementarity principle is related to heisenberg s indeterminacy principle , namely , the decrease in the fluctuation of one component corresponds to an increase of the complementary quantity .",
    "_ bohr explains this principle by the interference of the measuring device . _ in our example with sugar , the macro - measuring device ( the balance ) also plays its role . especially if , in the weighting process , `` self - feeding '' processes occur , similar to to those taking place when temperature is measured by a mercury thermometer , which `` absorbs into itself '' part of the energy ( heat ) of the particles that it is supposed to measure .",
    "bohr s complementarity principle was developed and applied not only by physicists with a wide outlook such as max born , but also by such pragmatists as pauli . according to the complementarity principle , motion and immobility , for example ,",
    "were compared .",
    "but a special role is played by the complementarity principle in equilibrium or nonequilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "just as the existing `` time - energy '' complementarity , in thermodynamics there is the complementarity `` observation time ",
    "size of the fluctuation , '' since we come to a situation of equilibrium thermodynamics , as we explained in the cup of tea example . here",
    "an essential role is played by viscosity , the slowing down phenomenon that leads to equilibrium thermodynamics _ up to a concrete value of the fluctuation_. the old thermodynamics was based on the boltzmann statistics , and the latter on the dogma of natural numbers .",
    "but it turned out that the dogma of natural numbers is just as unfit for very large collections considered in thermodynamics as euclidean geometry is for the description of the universe .",
    "below we construct a one - parameter family of ideal gases that describe such very large collections .",
    "as an example of the famous erds theorem from number theory , we consider the solution of the ancient problem _",
    "partitio numerorum_. this problem features an integer  @xmath5 , which is expanded into @xmath0 summands ; for example , suppose that @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 this yields @xmath29 variants of the solution of this problem .",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then there is only one variant of the expansion : @xmath32 . if @xmath30 and @xmath33 , then there is also only one variant of the expansion : the sum of 1 s , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "obviously , for a fixed number  @xmath5 , there exists a number  @xmath34 for which the number of variants  @xmath35 of the expansion is a maximum ( in general , this number is not unique ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 is called _",
    "hartley s entropy_. at the point where it attains its maximum , one has the maximum of the entropy .",
    "the chemical potential equal to zero corresponds to this point .",
    "suppose we are given the partition @xmath37 of the number  @xmath5 into @xmath0 summands .",
    "let @xmath38 be the number of summands on the right - hand side of this equation that are precisely equal to the number  @xmath39 .",
    "then there are @xmath40 in all , and this number is equal to  @xmath0 , because we know that there are only @xmath0 summands .",
    "further , the sum of summands equal to  @xmath39 is @xmath41 , because their number is @xmath38 ; hence the sum of all summands is obtained by summing these expressions over  @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath42 , and it is  @xmath5 .",
    "namely , @xmath43    the nonuniqueness of this maximum and the indeterminacy of the number of these maxima allowed erds to obtain his result only up to @xmath44 .",
    "thus , he retreated from the dogma of the natural numbers in the direction of the notion of soft set .",

    "let us briefly present results of the papers listed above .    if we consider the particular nonrelativistic case in which the hamiltonian  @xmath55 of the system is @xmath56 , where @xmath52 is the momentum and  @xmath53 the mass , then , up to constant multipliers , problem   corresponds to the two - dimensional case .    consider a straight line and a plane .",

    "indeed , we have the phase space in which the momenta are the extensive quantities  @xmath25 and  @xmath140 , and the corresponding coordinates are  @xmath24 and  @xmath15 .",

    "the wiener quantization coincides with the euclidean quantization well known in field theory . in the general case",
    ", this quantization corresponds to the passage from the feynman path integral to the wiener path integral and is in essence presented in detail for physicists in the book  @xcite by feynman and hibbs .    in the burgers equation , for @xmath149 ,",

    "the tunnel quantization of energy is given by the heaviside operator @xmath152 multiplied by the viscosity , @xmath153 . in thermodynamics ,",
    "the thermodynamical potential , the gibbs energy , is equal to @xmath154 , where @xmath13 stands for the chemical potential and @xmath0 for the conjugate extensive quantity , the number of particles .",

    "the value of @xmath172 at the function equal to one , @xmath174 , gives approximately @xmath175 .",
    "in our case , the pressure  @xmath24 plays the role of @xmath173 , and the volume @xmath25 plays the role of momentum @xmath52 . therefore , @xmath176 i.e. , @xmath177    following green  @xcite , d.  yu .  ivanov , a deep experimenter , poses the following question : why the deviations from the classical theory in the critical opalescence are observed within the limits of hundredths of a degree from the critical points , whereas the deviations in thermodynamical properties show  @xcite a nonclassical behavior at a much larger distance from the critical point ?",
    "professor ivanov claims that rather many questions of this kind have accumulated ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , and all these questions mainly deal with the behavior of practical systems .",
    "the point is that , from the point of view of the developed theory of critical indices  @xcite , there must be a drastic passage to the classical indices outside a neighborhood of the critical point .    to make ivanov s question understandable for persons who are not experts in critical points , we paraphrase the question for the case of geometric optics , when the sun rays are collected by a magnifying glass to a focus .",
    "if we were created a special construction for the vicinity of the focus in which the paper smoulders , then the experimenter could ask why the experiment gives a smooth picture of transition in the double logarithmic coordinates and the indices are preserved far away from the smouldering small vicinity of the focus . in the present case , the smouldering paper can be compared with the small area of opalescence ( drastic fluctuations near the critical point ) for which a separate theory was constructed . at the same time , the special function defining the point in wave theory ( like the weber function ) can be continued quite smoothly to a much wider domain in which the paper does not smoulder . in the opinion of ivanov ,",
    "this fact is much more important than the fact that wilson s theory gives the index 4.82 rather than 4.3 , whereas the latter is given by modern experiments .",
    "can the experimental index 4.3 be explained in principle in the framework of the conception presented by the author ?    whereas , in classical mechanics , there is no dependence on the planck constant @xmath178 , in classical thermodynamics we face a slow dependence of the viscosity on @xmath15 and @xmath179 , and thus _ vice versa _ as well . in our picture , the `` stretching '' of @xmath180 and @xmath181 in the experiment for real gases ( figs .",
    "10 and  11 ) is greater than in the van der waals model , which enables us to introduce the parameter @xmath182 for the `` stretching '' ( i.e. , @xmath183 ) and obtain the index @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "thus , in principle , the answer can be `` yes . ''",
    "it follows from what was said above that new critical indices arise only due to quantization of the conjugate pairs @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "thus , the relationships between intensive quantities can be taken classical , because everything is carried out under the assumption of infinitely small viscosity . in this case",
    ", one can also pass to other coordinates , to the pressure and density .",
    "write , as usual , @xmath188 in the classical case , we have ( @xcite ) @xmath189 in the classical case , @xmath190 in the tunnel quantum case , we obtain @xmath191 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in the limit as @xmath150 , and thus not precisely ( the stretching is not taken into account ) .",
    "this is obtained for the van der waals model quantized in the tunnel way .    if @xmath192 , then an uncertainty principle arises . let us proceed to the consideration of this principle .",
    "thus , for the wiener quantization , one takes for the main operators the heaviside operator @xmath193 and the operator of multiplication by @xmath173 rather than the momentum operator @xmath194 and the operator of multiplication by  @xmath173 .",
    "we have already defined the constant @xmath137 in  @xcite as viscosity .",
    "the tunnel quantization mainly differs from the euclidean and the ordinary ones in that it is considered up to @xmath195 , where @xmath87 is an arbitrarily chosen number ; this means that this quantization is factorized with respect to @xmath195 .",
    "however , first of all , one must define the space on which these operators act .",
    "as is well known , the heaviside operator is related to the two - sided laplace transform .",
    "this was shown already by van der pol and bremmer in  @xcite .",
    "introduce a family of functions @xmath196 to which we shall apply the two - sided laplace transform , namely , @xmath197 and thus these functions by themselves are one - sided laplace transforms of some function , @xmath198 for @xmath199 .",
    "denote by @xmath200 the two - sided laplace transform , @xmath201    if the functions @xmath202 are compactly supported and infinitely differentiable , then the closure of the operator  @xmath203 with respect to this domain can be carried out in a bergman space .",
    "then the functions @xmath204 here become analogous to the @xmath205-functions in the schrdinger quantization .",
    "moreover , @xmath206 , because these functions are real - valued .    let us note first of all that the squared function or , equivalently , the squared dispersion @xmath207 of the operator @xmath208 is @xmath209 and , since @xmath208 is not self - adjoint , the function @xmath210 need not be positive , and hence one must pass to its absolute value . therefore , the corresponding theorem for generic operators fails to hold in general .",
    "however , for the operators @xmath203 and @xmath173 on a reduced function space , we obtain @xmath211    it can readily be seen that weyl s proof ( which is presented in the comments to sec .",
    "16 of chap .",
    "ii in  @xcite ) can easily be transferred to the operators @xmath212 and @xmath173 in the above function space .",
    "let us repeat the manipulations presented in  @xcite with regard to the fact that @xmath212 satisfies the relation @xmath213 on the class of functions in question and @xmath214 .",
    "consider the obvious inequality @xmath215 where @xmath216 stands for an arbitrary real constant .",
    "when evaluating this integral , we see that @xmath217 we obtain @xmath218 for this quadratic trinomial ( in a ) to be positive for any value of a , the condition @xmath219 must be satisfied , or @xmath220 thus , the tunnel quantization explains both @xmath102 for photons and @xmath221 for bosons .",
    "let us note some consequences of tunnel quantization for the `` quantum '' bose gas .    a specific feature of the photon gas , which is mentioned in  ( * ?",
    "62 ,  63 ) , is that the number of particles in this gas , @xmath0 , is a variable quantity ( rather than a given constant , which is the case for an ordinary gas ) .",
    "thus , since the number of particles @xmath0 in thermodynamics is conjugate to the chemical potential , it follows that , if the number of particles is undefined , then the chemical potential can be given precisely , @xmath102 , under the assumption that @xmath13 and @xmath0 are tunnel quantized and the uncertainty principle holds .",
    "a contradiction between the conception of the author and the conception of physicists going back to einstein is also removed . in the case of a gas for which @xmath0 is fixed",
    ", we have @xmath222 according to the relation in  @xcite , and the chemical potential @xmath13 can be a small positive quantity .",
    "this is obvious , because @xmath223 ; however , this contradicts einstein s original conception claiming that @xmath221 .",
    "this contradiction is removed if the relationship of the uncertainty principle holds for @xmath13 and @xmath0 , because , if @xmath102 , then @xmath0 can take infinite values as well , and therefore the case @xmath224 is impossible .",
    "thus , it can be said that both the scaling hypothesis and the hypothesis of wiener quantization do not agree in the vicinity of critical point with the old thermodynamical conception of four potentials .",
    "however , the hypothesis of wiener quantization does not contradict the conception of four potentials , namely , the hypothesis complements the conception , and this works not only near the critical point but also on the entire domain `` gas  liquid '' by agreeing with the maxwell rule and by removing logical discrepancies in the bose gas theory .",
    "we have explained the wiener quantization , which enabled us to settle some problems .",
    "let us now also explain the second quantization for the wiener quantization .",
    "the principal element in fock s approach is the indistinguishability of particles . in our theory",
    ", this indistinguishability follows from the main original axiom .",
    "although there are no natural hilbert spaces here , in contrast to quantum mechanics , we can still obtain correct distinguished representations and limits as @xmath225 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  1 , appendix  1.a ) ) and",
    "then , in view of the new principle of indistinguishability for grains , perform the second quantization of classical theory by introducing the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "certainly , this is possible only under the condition of another `` identity principle '' than that used in  @xcite , namely , from the _ principle of indistinguishability of particles in our measurements _ , which follows from the existence of macro - measuring instrument .    in classical mechanics , operators of this kind",
    "were introduced in  @xcite on the basis of the schnberg concept ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the contemporary derivation of the vlasov equation is obtained by applying the method of second quantization for classical particles  @xcite . in this case , as @xmath3 , one obtains a system for which the creation and annihilation operators asymptotically commute , @xmath226 where @xmath227 stands for an external field and @xmath228 for the pairwise interaction .",
    "if one replaces @xmath229 and @xmath230 by the operators of creation and annihilation @xmath231 and @xmath232 in the fock space , then , after this change , system   becomes equivalent to the @xmath0-particle problem for the newton system .",
    "however , according to the rigorous mathematical proof , this can happen only for the case in which the classical particles are indistinguishable ( from the point of view of the notion of pile ) .    only in this case",
    "does the projection from the fock space to the @xmath22-dimensional space of @xmath0 particles give _ precisely _ the system of newton equations .",
    "note that the substitution @xmath233 reduces system to the form @xmath234 where @xmath235    the first equation of system   is the _ vlasov _ equation ( see  @xcite ) , where @xmath179 stands for the distribution function and @xmath236 for the dressed potential ( see sec .  2 , the formulas beginning with  ) ; the other equation is linear , and its meaning is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "note further a wiener - quantum jump of the index at the points of the spinodal of the liquid phase .",
    "the classical index of the spinodal is equal to 2 , namely , @xmath237 , similarly to turning points in quantum mechanics .",
    "the airy function corresponds to it .",
    "similarly to   , we obtain @xmath238    the solution @xmath163 of the burgers equation can be evaluated by the formula  . as @xmath239 , after the change @xmath240 , we obtain @xmath241 in our case , the momentum @xmath163 is the volume  @xmath25 .",
    "hence , similarly to the consideration  , we obtain @xmath242 , and the index at the points of the spinodal becomes equal to three .",
    "it is possible that an experimenter , when considering the approaching of the critical isotherm for @xmath243 to the critical point @xmath244 , moves ( due to the indeterminacy principle ) towards increasing values of  @xmath0 , and hence towards increasing density , and arrives at the spinodal of the liquid phase .",
    "this effect is similar to the accumulation of the wave crest which overturns afterwards ( a part of the particles outruns the point of creation of the shock wave ) . in this case , the critical index 4.3 passes to the index 3 of the spinodal ( and this index occasionally coincides with the classical index of the critical point ) .",
    "this passage , which is described by the vlasov equation , was experimentally noticed in  @xcite and in other works .",
    "therefore , the experiments of ivanov  @xcite and wagner  ( @xcite ) , where the modifications of the critical index @xmath245 from 4.3 to 3 were obtained when approaching the critical point , do not contradict our conception .",
    "for the creation of dimers , the author of the present paper used the creation and annihilation operators for pairs of particles  ( @xcite and  @xcite ) and referred to this invention as the ultrasecond quantization .",
    "experimenters do not distinguish between dimers either , counting only their number ( for example , as was shown by calo  @xcite , the presence of 57% dimers leads to the appearance of a cluster cascade ) .",
    "thus , we discover new relations , namely , an extension of the program `` partitio numerorum '' in number theory from the point of view of the notion of hartley entropy , and indicate possible generalizations of quantization , which lead to an extension of the heisenberg indeterminacy principle  @xcite .",
    "the ultrasecond quantization led to thermodynamics in nanocapillaries and enabled one to obtain the superfluidity of liquids in nanotubes  @xcite , which was confirmed in experiments ( see  @xcite ) .    a relationship between the parameters @xmath245 and @xmath246 follows from the `` classical '' thermodynamics .",
    "the relation for the compressibility index , @xmath247 does not need the scaling hypothesis either . the corresponding inequality uses convexity , which is closely related to tropical mathematics , which is the limit as the viscosity tends to zero .",
    "the inequality becomes an equality as the chemical potential tends to zero , @xmath248 , according to tropical geometry  @xcite .",
    "experiments showed that the orthometric curve ( the zeno line ) @xmath249 ( @xmath250 ) on the @xmath251 plane is a line segment , and hence is completely determined by the two endpoints of the segment , the points @xmath252 and @xmath253 , where @xmath252 is the well - known boyle temperature and @xmath253 stands for the boyle density , which can not be found experimentally , because the point @xmath254 is inaccessible .",

    "this fact is well known as `` kay s rule '' in the phenomenological theory of mixtures . for air , we have @xmath483 , whereas @xmath484 for oxygen ( 20% in air ) and @xmath485 for nitrogen ( 80% in air ) .",
    "the value of @xmath486 coincides with the value of this quantity evaluated according to the above formulas up to the accuracy of @xmath487 .",
    "we have defined @xmath360 for the ideal gases , and hence also @xmath488 for a gas mixture . for a mixture of real gases",
    ", we must define the function @xmath489 .",
    "it turns out that , for a mixture , the zeno - line is not a segment of a straight line , which is the case and is observed experimentally for pure gases . therefore , for a mixture , it is insufficient to find the values @xmath490 and @xmath491 .",
    "one must also define the function @xmath492 .",
    "this can be carried out by using the following formulas .",
    "we are interested only in the values of @xmath493 and @xmath494 that correspond to the zeno line of each of the gases ( see  - ) .",
    "since , by assumption , the critical point enters the homogeneity domain , it follows that the concentrations @xmath481 and @xmath246 are preserved , and hence , using equations   , we obtain the following equation for the sum of the entropies , where @xmath495 : @xmath496 where @xmath497 is equal to the ratio @xmath498 .",
    "recall that the values of @xmath499 and @xmath500 are taken according to the zeno lines of the first and the second gas , respectively .",
    "hence , using the given values of @xmath107 , @xmath459 , and @xmath460 obtained from , we find  the value @xmath501 , which defines the function @xmath502 by relation  .",
    "this enables us to define the dependence of @xmath486 for a mixture of real gases .",
    "we have proved that the boltzmann distribution , which is based on the fact that transpositions of two particles in a set of @xmath0 particles lead to a new microscopic state , is based in turn on the dogma of the natural series , and hence can not be applied to the concept of `` pile '' as a macroscopic state .",
    "this implies that the maxwell distribution describes the ideal gas too roughly .",
    "the introduction of new parameter @xmath107 enables one to assign the mean energy of the system with respect to the spectral density of a given molecule with higher accuracy as compared with the similar assignment using the equidistribution law with respect to the degrees of freedom , where only the number of atoms of the given molecule is taken into account . as @xmath503 or @xmath504 ( the  chemical potential )",
    ", we obtain the old conception of ideal gas .",
    "certainly , the interaction of molecules depends on the spectrum of molecules .",
    "however , the experiment shows that , for all molecules except for those of water , there are two important constants , @xmath252 and @xmath253 , and it turns out that these two constants and the critical value of the compressibility factor are sufficient to describe , with the corresponding accuracy , both the equation of state of a pure gas and that of a gas mixture .",
    "bohr s complementarity principle , as applied to thermodynamical quantities , enables one to elucidate the notion of critical exponents anew .",
    "as was said above , we consider probability theory without preliminarily passing to the limit @xmath505 we first consider the system for a finite  @xmath0 , @xmath506 in this system of equations , we pass to the asymptotic behavior as @xmath3 and @xmath507 in such a way that @xmath0 and @xmath5 turn out to be connected by a relation corresponding to relation   of the present paper .",
    "we consider the set of solutions of system   as the family of elementary equiprobable events . to be more precise , we consider the solutions of the system of inequalities @xmath508 rather than the system of equations . as is clear from system  , there is an @xmath34 such that the number of solutions of this system is the largest possible , and this number can asymptotically be calculated .",
    "the number @xmath509 corresponds to  @xmath34 .",
    "one can introduce two lagrange conjugate quantities , namely , the chemical potential @xmath13 and the inverse temperature @xmath246 .",
    "the value @xmath102 corresponds to the critical values @xmath34 and @xmath509 .",
    "thus , we can transfer all our considerations concerning ideal gases to the new probability theory .",
    "poincar writes about an insufficiently clear ( `` obscure '' ) `` instinct which we call common sense '' on which probability theory ( and , i shall add , the notion of independent events ) must be based .",
    "if one starts from the notion of ideal gas as a gas of particles without interaction , then it is natural to assume that independent events are events without interaction .",
    "however , when we consider a mixture of ideal gases , then we start from the very absence of interaction between the particles .",
    "since relations   express this condition , we must use these very relations .    in this definition of independent events , there is an _ a priori _ given probability @xmath510 the parameter @xmath107 is related to the notion of fractal dimension , and thus to the hausdorff  besicovitch dimension , and , in this relation , this notion , which has recently been widely used , must necessarily be related to the new probability theory . by the definition in  ,",
    "the formulas are of `` conditional '' nature in the sense appropriate in the ordinary probability theory .",
    "the notion of independence has already been considered in kolmogorov s complexity theory and completely agrees with formula  . as far as formula",
    "is concerned , it distinguishes a sufficiently important class in the case of dependent events .    to generalize the new definition of independence of events in the new probability theory , it is necessary to pass first of all from equiprobable elementary events presented above to equipping these events by weights , which is brilliantly done in vershik s paper  @xcite , and to a generalization of the new notion of independent events to vershik s multiplicative measures . in this case , measure theory , which is the most important element of kolmogorov s probability theory , will find an application also to the above new conception of independent events .",
    "as already stated on numerous occasions , money obeys the `` bose statistics '' and banknotes of one denomination , are practically indistinguishable despite their different numbers  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can associate the `` number '' ( amount ) of money with the number of particles in physics ( which is consistent with irving fisher s correspondence principle )  @xcite . in economics ,",
    "the goods are also averaged .",
    "the term `` wholesale '' is usually used for them , and the term `` at retail '' can be used only occasionally , for example , for authorized artwork .",
    "fisher s correspondence principle consists in the following comparison of economic and physical quantities :    the volume of goods @xmath511 corresponds to the volume of gas @xmath25 ;    the price of the amount of goods @xmath24 corresponds to the pressure @xmath24 ;    the amount of money @xmath5 corresponds to the number of particles @xmath0 ;    the turnover rate @xmath25 corresponds to the temperature @xmath15 .    by friedman s rule",
    ", the optimal amount of money corresponds to the zero nominal percentage  @xcite . combining this with the appropriately modified method of lagrange indeterminate multipliers",
    ", we can regard the nominal percentage  @xmath327 as an addition to the amount of money  @xmath5 .    in the same way",
    ", the value of the turnover rate @xmath25 is associated with the degree of uncertainty , or entropy  , which is an additional quantity : @xmath512 where @xmath104 is a certain constant , its own for each currency , and @xmath513 .",
    "the price of the volume @xmath514 has the form @xmath515    now irving fisher s correspondence principle can be extended to all the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the ratio @xmath516 allows us to obtain , for economics , the family of distributions depending on the parameter  @xmath107 once the value of the quantity @xmath517 is calculated as @xmath518 .",
    "irving fisher had in mind the correspondence which is known today under the title of the `` fundamental law of economics , '' @xmath519 in view of  , this correspondence takes the form @xmath520 where the compressibility factor @xmath521 has its own particular value for each country or region .",
    "the introduction of a common currency for a group of countries ( or regions ) corresponds to the mixing of pure gases ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "an example of the case of the zero nominal percentage  @xmath327 in the ussr was the post - war reconstruction of industry accompanied by the simultaneous reduction in prices .",
    "we see that this corresponds to the maximal entropy as a measure of uncertainty ( under a planified socialist economy ! ) .",
    "hence , as the turnover rate  @xmath25 ( similar to temperature in thermodynamics ) falls , this must lead to the equilibrium of the system of sharp stratification of society into the rich and the poor in view of the desire of the society to have a rest from stresses ..    now let us introduce a general notion which is the addition of mobility braking factors to the rate of economic processes . this may be bureaucratic red tape , holidays , delays in taking decisions , criminal behavior , economic and natural disasters , strikes , lack of stimulus among producers , traffic jams , flight delays , and so on",
    ". situations in which there are delays in the reaction of economic agents owing to abrupt changes in policy also play a significant role in economics .",
    "let us call this turnover rate braking parameter _",
    "viscosity _ and denote it by the letter  @xmath96 .",
    "in thermodynamics , viscosity weakly depends on temperature . in economics , viscosity depends on the degree of uncertainty ( entropy ) .",
    "we have already stated that viscosity for the rich can be decreased by bribes , which further increases the stratification of society .",
    "but since , as @xmath522 , we obtain a sufficiently handy tool for determining various financial changes in time ( such as in tropical mathematics , which can be applied to economics ) , then we can assume that this parameter is small .",
    "the widespread use of computers , undoubtedly , decreases it still further .",
    "since more and more computers are used to perform various functions , which leads to a decrease of the parameter  @xmath96 , it follows that the effects of the wiener quantization of economics corresponding to phase transitions will play an increasingly greater role .    therefore , we can extend bohr s complementarity principle in economics by the wiener quantization of equilibrium economics and by geometric quantization using the tunnel canonical operator .",
    "we shall consider the wiener quantization of economics by analogy with thermodynamics ( see section  2 ) using the correspondence @xmath523",
    "if economic optimization problems ( even in implicit form ) involve a hamiltonian of the form @xmath524 ( see pospelov s paper  @xcite ) , then , by expressing @xmath525 ( an analog of the gibbs thermodynamic potential ) from the condition @xmath526 in terms of @xmath527 , we obtain an analog of the equation of state .    the wiener quantization ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) involves the correspondence @xmath528 we can assume without detriment to the asymptotics as @xmath522 that the differential operators act first and the operators of multiplication by @xmath529 second .",
    "more complicated equations of economics , just as the vlasov equations , preserve the lagrangian property of surfaces of the type of the `` equation of state . ''",
    "therefore , we can apply the geometric wiener ( tunnel ) quantization  @xcite .",
    "the phase transition to the two - phase system `` gas  liquid '' ( or `` the poor  the rich '' ) occurs for a given operator rate  @xmath25 for a definite value of the nominal percentage  @xmath327 .",
    "debts correspond to negative values of  @xmath5 and  @xmath24 .",
    "this does not preclude a country with a huge internal debt , such as the united states at the time of the war in iraq , to calculate @xmath119 by formula  .",
    "then the critical value of debt will be the optimal value of  @xmath5 , i.e. , the condition for a maximum of the entropy for a given  @xmath107 . in the case where @xmath24 is negative ( as was the case in the united states when the war expenditures produced debts ) and @xmath5 is positive , the critical value of debt is the continuation of @xmath119 to the negative domains of  @xmath24 and  @xmath76 .",
    "this corresponds to negative pressure described in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec .  6 ) ( see also  @xcite ) .    in this case",
    ", we can also calculate the value of  @xmath530 at which the `` bose - condensate '' phenomenon , corresponding to bankruptcy , occurs ( see  @xcite ) , and we can define the critical value of a debt crisis .    to calculate",
    "the parameter @xmath107 for each currency is an extremely difficult problem . since the curve of critical temperature in fig .",
    "10 is almost the same for a great number of gases , the same must also hold in economics for the currencies of different countries .",
