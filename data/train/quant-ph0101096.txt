    "entanglement and its information - theoretic aspects have been studied by many authors @xcite . here",
    "we give a short survey of the theory of entanglement that we will later apply to quasi - bell states . for a pure",
    "entangled state of a bipartite system @xmath0 , the measure of entanglement defined as @xcite @xmath1 is called the `` entropy of entanglement '' .",
    "this quantity enjoys two kinds of information - theoretic interpretations .",
    "one is that @xmath2 gives the entanglement of formation , which is defined as the asymptotic number @xmath3 of standard singlet states required to faithfully locally prepare @xmath4 identical copies of a system in the bipartite state @xmath0 for very large @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the other is that @xmath2 gives the amount of distillable entanglement , which is the asymptotic number of singlets @xmath3 that can be distilled from @xmath4 identical copies of @xmath0 . with either of these definitions of @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ", @xmath2 satisfies @xmath5 for pure states we can rewrite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the binary entropy function and @xmath8 is the `` concurrence '' defined by @xmath9 .",
    "the above expression is valid for mixed states of two qubit systems as well @xcite .    for mixed states of qubits one may also define an expression for the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the average entanglement of the pure states of a decomposition @xmath10 of the density operator @xmath11 , minimized over all decompositions @xcite @xmath12 in general , it is difficult to find the exact amount of entanglement of formation except for special cases .",
    "however , there is a lower bound which is expressed in terms of a quantity called the `` fully entangled fraction '' , which we denote by @xmath13 and is defined as @xmath14 where the maximum is over all completely entangled states @xmath15 .",
    "a lower bound on the entanglement of formation is @xcite @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } h [ \\frac{1}{2 } + \\sqrt{f(1-f ) } ] & ( f \\ge \\frac{1}{2})\\\\ 0   & ( f < \\frac{1}{2})\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] usually in order to construct entangled states one writes superpositions of orthogonal states .",
    "for instance the standard bell basis uses states like @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and of course its properties are well known .",
    "our concern here is what kind of properties appear if we have superpositions of nonorthogonal states . in this paper",
    ", we will clarify properties of entangled states of nonorthogonal states such as coherent states based on the above basic theory .",
    "let us consider entangled states based on two nonorthogonal states @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is real .",
    "we can define a set of 4 entangled states as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are normalization constants : @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we call these states `` quasi - bell states '' .",
    "they are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "in fact for @xmath23 real their gram matrix @xmath28 becomes @xmath29 where @xmath30 . if the basic states are orthogonal ( @xmath31 ) , then these states reduce to standard bell states .",
    "let us discuss the entropy of entanglement for the above states .",
    "we first calculate the reduced density operators of the quasi - bell states .",
    "they are @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 @xmath35 the eigenvalues of the above density operators @xmath36(or @xmath37 ) are given in terms of the gram matrix elements @xmath38 as follows , @xmath39 and for @xmath40(or @xmath41 ) we have @xmath42 hence , the entropy of entanglement is @xmath43 and @xmath44 because @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . thus @xmath47 and @xmath48 are maximally entangled , even though the entangled states consist of nonorthogonal states in each subsystem .",
    "these results are true for arbitrary nonorthogonal states with @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath50 @xmath23 and do not depend on the physical dimension of the systems",
    ". this property may be unexpected but can be understood easily by noting that the states @xmath52 and @xmath53 are equivalent to @xmath54 in terms of the orthogonal basis @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "we can construct a quasi - werner mixed state based on quasi - bell states by @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath58,@xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are bell states , then the above equation gives a standard werner state @xcite .",
    "it is known that the fully entangled fraction of the werner state is @xmath62 , and the entanglement of formation of the werner state is given by @xmath63}\\right).\\ ] ] the fully entangled fraction of the quasi werner state is analogously given by @xmath64 because the quasi bell states are orthogonal to each other , except for the pair of states @xmath58 and @xmath60 , as one can see from the gram matrix @xmath65 .",
    "however , the quasi werner state and werner state are completely different states . in particular , the eigenvalues of quasi werner states are different from those of werner states .",
    "the eigenvalues of the density operator are given by those of the modified gram matrix @xcite .",
    "for the quasi werner state , the gram matrix is @xmath66 as a result , we have @xmath62 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 as the eigenvalues of the quasi werner state .",
    "thus the lower bound of the entropy of formation of quasi werner state is the same as that of werner state . for more general mixtures of quasi bell",
    "states we will need a more advanced analysis which is reported on in a subsequent paper .",
    "let us consider two coherent states of a bosonic mode @xmath70 , e.g. , let @xmath71 be the coherent amplitude of a light field . using previous notation , we have @xmath72",
    ". then one can construct the quasi bell states as follows : @xmath73 since the coherent states are nonorthogonal , we can apply the results of section 2 to these states .",
    "states of similar form were discussed by sanders @xcite , and wielinga @xcite , who called these states entangled coherent states . from the results in the section 2 , we know that @xmath59 and @xmath61 have one ebit of entanglement independent of @xmath74 .",
    "this is an interesting and potentially useful property ( see next section ) . on the other hand , @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "are maximally entangled states only in the limit @xmath77 . in order to avoid confusion with continuous variable states",
    "@xcite , we should mention here that , of course , the dimension of the space spanned by the quasi bell states is 4 even though they are embedded in a vector space of infinite dimension .",
    "this implies that the maximum value of the von neumann entropy for the quasi bell states is unity .",
    "different amplitudes @xmath74 just give the degree of nonorthogonality .",
    "it also means that one can not use coherent entangled states for teleportation of continuous quantum variables @xcite . in a separate paper @xcite",
    ", we will show how to use entangled coherent states for teleportation of schrdinger cat states .",
    "the average photon numbers of the reduced states of the quasi bell states read @xmath78 thus the quasi bell states can have arbitrary photon numbers .",
    "as said above , however , the quasi bell states are not truly continuous variable states and in particular do not belong to the class of gaussian states @xcite,@xcite in contrast to , e.g. , the two mode squeezed state @xcite .",
    "this is shown in the following way .",
    "the characteristic functions of the quasi bell states are given by @xmath79 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "& \\times & \\exp\\{-(|\\xi |^2 + |\\eta |^2)/2\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "they can be calculated , with the result @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the characteristic functions are indeed not gaussian .",
    "finally let us explore one more property of a similar set of entangled states .",
    "if the amplitudes of the modes a and mode b in @xmath59 ( or @xmath61 ) are chosen to be different , say , @xmath74 and @xmath84 , respectively , the eigenvalues of the reduced density operator are @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we can then easily see that the entropy of entanglement attains its maximum value of 1 only when the amplitudes of both modes are the same .",
    "in this section , we will discuss decoherence properties of the state @xmath47 .",
    "we are concerned with the decoherence due to energy loss or photon absorption . in particular",
    ", we would like to demonstrate that entangled coherent states possess a certain degree of robustness against decoherence when compared to a standard bi - photon bell state .",
    "we assume that alice produces a coherent entangled state @xmath47 , keeps one part ( @xmath88 ) and transmits the other part @xmath89 to bob through a lossy channel .",
    "bob will receive an attenuated optical state .",
    "thus , alice prepares @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "when we employ a half mirror model for the noisy channel , the effect of energy losses is described by a linear coupling with an external vacuum field as follows : @xmath93    where the mode @xmath2 is an external mode responsible for the energy loss , @xmath94 is the noise parameter , and @xmath74 is taken as real .",
    "if we use @xmath95 as the initial state , the final state entangled with the environment is @xmath96 the normalized density operator shared by alice and bob is given by a super operator calculation @xcite , @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "let us discuss the entanglement of the above density operator .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , we can use the entangled fraction to measure the entanglement of this mixed state .",
    "the fully entangled fraction of @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 is indeed maximally entangled .",
    "the above is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the maximum is attained for the value @xmath107 that is , exactly halfway between the original coherent amplitude and the attenuated amplitude . in figure 1",
    "we plot @xmath108 as a function of @xmath109 for various values of the noise parameter @xmath94 .    [ f1 ]    for comparison",
    ", we consider the biphoton bell state : @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes single photon polarization directions . after passing through the same lossy channel , alice and bob share the state @xmath112 with @xmath113 the identity on mode @xmath88 . as a result ,",
    "the fully entangled fraction is @xmath114 in that case , which is clearly less than for entangled coherent states with sufficiently small amplitudes ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "finally , we note that in @xcite we give the analogous decoherence properties for a symmetric noise channel , describing the case where both alice s and bob s mode suffer losses .",
    "in this paper , our effort was devoted to clarify several properties of entangled nonorthogonal states .",
    "we constructed 4 entangled states that generalize the standard bell states .",
    "two out of these 4 `` quasi bell states '' possess less than one unit of entanglement , the other two , however , possess exactly one unit .",
    "the latter two states were shown to be more robust against decoherence due to photon absorption than are bi - photon bell states .",
    "the most important remaining problem is the physical realization of such states , which is discussed in a forthcoming separate paper @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to c.h.bennett , s.m.barnett , c.a.fuchs , a.s.holevo , r.jozsa , + m.sasaki , and p.shor for helpful discussions .",
    "the first idea of quasi bell state was presented in qcm @xmath115 c-2000 held in capri . + this work was supported by the project in crest japan ."
