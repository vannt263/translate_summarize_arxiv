    "neutron stars ( nss ) are born from the core collapse of massive stars , whose deaths are marked by supernova remnants ( snrs ) . measuring the proper motions of young nss",
    "allows their trajectories to be traced back , and can thus provide strong tests of proposed ns - snr associations . in cases where",
    "such associations can be confirmed , an independent age estimate can be derived for both the ns and its associated snr .",
    "however , such an exercise is subject to several pitfalls . on one hand",
    ", a typical radio pulsar might be detectable for @xmath7  yr , while the associated snr fades into the interstellar medium ( ism ) in @xmath8  yr , leaving behind young pulsars with no detectable snrs .",
    "on the other hand , there are also several snrs with no associated pulsars .",
    "not all nss are radio pulsars , but when young , they are all likely to be bright in thermal x - ray emission , as illustrated , for example , by the detection of point sources in the snrs kes 73 @xcite and kes 79 @xcite .",
    "the absence of such x - ray detections in a set of nearby , young snrs @xcite aggravates the problem . while unusual cooling scenarios may be required for nss in these young snrs , a partial explanation for the `` missing '' nss might lie in their birth velocities .",
    "radio pulsars have characteristic birth velocities @xmath6 400 - 500  km  s@xmath3  @xcite , and they are likely to escape their natal remnants once the expansion of the snr is decelerated by the ism , making identification of pulsar - snr pairs problematic .",
    "thus , cases where a young radio pulsar can be associated with a snr are particularly important . the pulsars b1757@xmath024 and b1951@xmath132 present two such situations in which associations might be possible .",
    "both are young pulsars with high spin - down energy - loss rates , and in both cases , the ram pressure balance between the ns relativistic wind and the ism produces a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) with a bow shock structure .",
    "psr  b1757@xmath024 appears to be exiting the approximately circular snr  g5.4@xmath01.2 , whose asymmetric brightness , in conjunction with the pwn produced by the pulsar , produces the structure known as `` the duck '' ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : duck ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , psr  b1951 + 32 drives a complex interaction within the snr  ctb  80 ( g69.0@xmath12.7 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : ctb80 ] ) , including a radio - bright structure resembling a bow shock in the direction of its motion .",
    "we present very large array ( vla ) observations that improve the time baseline for the proper motion measurements of these two pulsars . in ",
    "[ sec : duck ] we detail the observations , analysis , and results for psr  b1757@xmath024 , and likewise for psr  b1951@xmath132 in  [ sec : ctb80 ] .",

    "psr  b1757@xmath024  is an energetic young pulsar , with a period @xmath9  ms , a spindown energy loss rate @xmath10  erg  s@xmath3 , and a characteristic age @xmath11  kyr .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : duck ] , its location and the morphology of its pwn suggest that it is escaping the circular snr  g5.4@xmath01.2 @xcite .",
    "if it was born at the center of the remnant and its characteristic age is close to its real age , that would imply a proper motion @xmath6 70  mas  yr@xmath3  and a transverse velocity @xmath61500 - 2000  km  s@xmath3 , high compared to the radio pulsar population .",
    "however , @xcite placed an upper limit on the motion of the pwn that was inconsistent with such a high velocity , and suggested that the true age of the pulsar was much larger than the characteristic age .",
    "@xcite derived comparable limits on the proper motion of the pulsar ( rather than the pwn ) of ( @xmath12  mas  yr@xmath3 and suggested instead that the proximity of b1757@xmath024 and g5.4@xmath01.2 was merely a line - of - sight coincidence in the crowded region near the galactic center .",
    "arguments for and against an association between the pulsar and snr were summarized by @xcite , who improved the upper limit on the westward proper motion of the pwn and concluded that both interpretations for the duck ( a line - of - sight coincidence and a genuine association with a large age ) remained viable .    based on the dispersion measure ,",
    "psr  b1757@xmath024 is estimated to lie at a distance of 5.2@xmath130.5  kpc @xcite , while the distance to g5.27@xmath01.2 is greater than 4.3  kpc based on absorption @xcite .",

    "the aips task uvfix was used to recalculate the _ uvw _ coordinates incorporating aberration corrections not performed by the vla online system .",
    "given the large field of view and the sparse distribution of sources with compact structure , we selected 14 sub - regions of the field ( containing the pulsar and 13 other apparently compact sources ) for imaging .",
    "these fields were jointly deconvolved to produce initial images .",
    "two self - calibration and imaging iterations were performed using all 14 sub - regions to generate the final images used for the astrometry .    positions of reference sources and the pulsar were determined with a gaussian fit using the aips task jmfit .",

    "the reference source positions and fluxes from the ( ungated ) 2004 december 09 epoch are listed in table  [ tab : refsrc - duck ] , and our method is described in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "the 10  pwn in which the pulsar is embedded is resolved out by our observations , but it contributes an additional uncertainty to the position of the pulsar in the ungated data . to account for the @xmath650% increase in rms noise within this region relative to the background , the pulsar position uncertainties were increased in ungated epochs by a factor of 1.5 . in the gated data ,",

    "currently , over 1600 radio pulsars have measured values for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as listed in the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite . in this large ensemble , b1757@xmath024 and b1951@xmath132",
    "are among the fifty most energetic pulsars , with @xmath64 and @xmath65  erg  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "they are also among the hundred youngest known pulsars , with characteristic ages @xmath66 and @xmath67  kyr , respectively . on one hand , the characteristic age of b1951@xmath132 is likely to be an overestimate , since its current spin period is not much greater than the typical birth spin periods of pulsars @xcite , and its kinematic age @xmath68  kyr , assuming birth near the center of ctb  80 .",
    "on the other hand , the upper limits on its westward proper motion suggest that b1757@xmath024 may be substantially older than its characteristic age .",
    "although the true ages of the pulsars differ in relation to their respective characteristic ages , these two pulsars are quite similar in energetics and age .",
    "both pulsars also exhibit cometary pwne .",
    "b1757@xmath024 is associated with a @xmath69  elongated nebula visible at both radio ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : duck ] ) and x - ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "b1951 + 32 shows a cometary pwn in x - rays @xcite , but its radio structure resembles a bow shock and an extended , limb - brightened bubble , and it is enclosed by a complex nebula visible in h@xmath32 @xcite , with extended lobes and a bow shock structure .",
    "@xcite suggest that the pulsar is interacting with the wall of its evolved snr , and we find that the radio shock structure changes with time while moving with the pulsar .",
    "on the other hand , b1757@xmath024 appears to be outside any parent remnant .",
    "if indeed it is associated with g5.4@xmath01.2 , it would have interacted with the wall of the remnant in the past ( as b1951 + 32 is at present ) , possibly re - energising the shell and leaving behind the structure we see as the duck .",
    "alternatively , the parent remnant of b1757@xmath024 is no longer visible , and we are witnesses to a cosmic coincidence .",
