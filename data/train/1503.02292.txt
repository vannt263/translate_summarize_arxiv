    "mobile traffic demand is increasing rapidly , and a 1000-fold demand increase by 2020 is predicted by some industry and academic experts @xcite . in order to meet this explosive growth demand and enhance the mobile network capacity , there has been an increasing interest in deploying small cells underlying the conventional homogeneous macrocell network @xcite .",
    "this new network deployment is usually referred to as heterogeneous cellular networks ( hcns ) . however , reducing the radii of small cells in the carrier frequencies employed in today s cellular systems to reap the spatial reuse benefits is fundamentally limited by interference constraints @xcite . by using higher frequency bands , such as the millimeter wave ( mmwave ) bands between 30 and 300 ghz , and bringing the network closer to users by a dense deployment of small cells @xcite , hcns can significantly boost the overall network capacity due to less interference and higher data rates . with huge bandwidth available in the mmwave band , small cells at mmwave frequencies are able to provide multi - gigabit communication services , such as uncompressed and high - definition video transmission , high speed internet access , and wireless gigabit ethernet for laptops and desktops , and have attracted considerable interest from academia , industry , and standards bodies @xcite .",
    "rapid development in complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor radio frequency integrated circuits @xcite accelerates the industrialization of mmwave communications .",
    "meanwhile , standards , such as ecma-387 @xcite , ieee 802.15.3c @xcite , and ieee 802.11ad @xcite , have been defined for indoor wireless personal area networks ( wpan ) or wireless local area networks ( wlan ) .    unlike existing communication systems of macrocells using lower carrier frequencies ( e.g. , from 900 mhz to 5 ghz ) , small cells in the mmwave band suffer from high propagation loss .",
    "the free space propagation loss at 60 ghz band is 28 decibels ( db ) more than that at 2.4 ghz @xcite . to combat severe channel attenuation ,",
    "high gain directional antennas are utilized at both the transmitter and receiver to achieve directional transmission @xcite . with a small wavelength ,",
    "it is feasible to produce low - cost and compact on - chip and in - package antennas in the mmwave band @xcite . under directional transmission",
    ", the third party nodes can not perform carrier sense as in ieee 802.11 to avoid contention with current transmission , which is referred to as the deafness problem . on the other hand ,",
    "there is less interference among links , and concurrent transmissions ( spatial reuse ) can be exploited to greatly improve network capacity . due to directivity and high propagation loss ,",
    "the interference among cells is minimal , and total capacity of small cells scales with the number of cells in a given region @xcite . on the other hand , as the data transmission rates of radio access networks increase dramatically , providing backhaul to transport data to ( from ) the gateway in the core network for small cells becomes a significant challenge problem @xcite .",
    "although fiber based backhaul offers larger bandwidth to meet this requirement , it is costly , inflexible and time - consuming to connect the densely deployed small cells with high connectivity .",
    "in contrast , high speed wireless backhaul is more cost - effective , flexible , and easier to deploy @xcite . wireless backhaul in mmwave bands , especially 60 ghz band , can be a promising backhaul solution for small cells @xcite .",
    "the wide bandwidth enables several - gbps data rate even with simple modulation schemes such as ook , bpsk and fsk .",
    "[ htbp ]        in fig .",
    "[ small cell ] , we present a typical scenario for dense deployment of small cells in the 60 ghz band underlying the macrocell cellular network , which forms hcns . in hcns , the macrocell is coupled with the small cells in the mmwave band to some extent @xcite , and the macrocell network is allowed to have certain visibility and radio resource management control over the small cells @xcite .",
    "users can communicate via the current macrocell as well as the small cells . in the small cells , mobile users",
    "are associated with access points ( aps ) , and aps are connected through wireless backhaul links .",
    "some aps are connected to the internet via a direct and high speed wired connection , which are called _",
    "gateways_. in this targeted small cells system , both the radio access and backhaul links are in the 60 ghz band , which can provide high data rate for both radio access and backhaul , and also reduce implementation complexity and deployment cost . considering the fundamental differences between mmwave communications and existing other communication systems using lower carrier frequencies ,",
    "scheduling over both the radio access and backhaul networks is a difficult problem and should be carefully designed .",
    "there are two aspects of challenges . in the first aspect , it is necessary to consider both radio access and backhaul networks jointly @xcite . on one hand , co - design of scheduling for transmission over radio access and backhaul networks",
    "can maximize the spatial reuse across radio access and backhaul networks .",
    "consequently , network capacity and performance can be improved significantly .",
    "on the other hand , joint scheduling for transmission over radio access and backhaul networks can also manage the interference both within each cell and among cells efficiently . in the second aspect , under dense deployment",
    ", there is a high probability that two devices within both the same cell and different cells are located near to each other . in this case",
    ", user devices can transmit data to each other over direct links using the small cell resources , instead of through aps .",
    "thus , most of context - aware applications that involve discovering and communicating with nearby devices , including the popular content downloading , can benefit from the device - to - device communications by reducing the communication cost since it enables physical - proximity communication , which saves power while improving the spectral efficiency @xcite .",
    "therefore , the potential of device - to - device communications to enhance the network performance should also be considered in the joint scheduling problem over both radio access and backhaul networks .",
    "aiming to address the above challenges , in this paper , we propose a joint transmission scheduling scheme , termed d2dmac , for small cells in the mmwave band . in d2dmac ,",
    "joint scheduling over radio access and backhaul networks is considered , and direct transmissions between devices are further exploited to improve network performance in terms of throughput and delay . if the direct link between the sender and receiver of one flow has high channel quality , the direct transmission will be adopted instead of transmission through the backhaul network .",
    "the contributions of this paper are three - fold , which are summarized as follows .    * we formulate the joint scheduling problem over both the radio access and backhaul networks with the direct transmissions between devices considered into a mixed integer linear program ( milp ) , i.e. , to minimize the number of time slots to accommodate the traffic demand of all flows .",
    "concurrent transmissions , i.e. , spatial reuse , are explicitly considered in this formulated problem .",
    "* we propose an efficient scheduling scheme termed d2dmac , which consists of a path selection criterion and a transmission scheduling algorithm to solve the formulated problem .",
    "the priority of device - to - device transmission is characterized by the path selection parameter of the path selection criterion , while concurrent transmissions are fully exploited in the transmission scheduling algorithm to maximize the spatial reuse gain . *",
    "we analyze the concurrent transmission conditions in d2dmac , and derive a sufficient condition for each link to support concurrent transmissions with other links , i.e. , the distances between the interference sources and the receiver of this link should be larger than or equal to its interference radius .",
    "we also analyze the interference radii under different modulation and coding schemes , different path loss exponents , different link lengths , and different transmission power . * through extensive simulations under different traffic patterns and user deployments ,",
    "we demonstrate our proposed d2dmac achieves near - optimal performance in some cases in terms of delay and throughput by comparison with the optimal solution , and it outperforms the other existing related protocols significantly .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the impact of path selection parameter on performance improvement .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : section [ s2 ] presents related work on scheduling in the mmwave band .",
    "section [ s3 ] introduces the system model and illustrates our basic idea by an example .",
    "section [ s4 ] formulates the optimal joint scheduling problem of access and backhaul with device - to - device transmissions considered as an milp .",
    "section [ s5 ] presents our proposed scheme , d2dmac , which includes the path selection criterion and transmission scheduling algorithm .",
    "section  [ s5-i ] presents the conditions for concurrent transmissions and gives a performance analysis .",
    "section [ s6 ] shows the simulation results of d2dmac under various traffic patterns and different path selection parameters , and the comparison with the optimal solution and other protocols .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper in section [ s7 ] .",
    "recently , some related work on scheduling for small cells in the mmwave band has been published . since the standards of ecma-387 @xcite and ieee 802.15.3c @xcite",
    "adopt tdma , some work is also based on tdma @xcite . in two protocols based on ieee 802.15.3c @xcite ,",
    "multiple links are scheduled to communicate in the same slot if the multi - user interference ( mui ) between them is below a specific threshold .",
    "@xcite proposed a concurrent transmission scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of flows scheduled with the quality of service requirement of each flow satisfied .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of exclusive region ( er ) to support concurrent transmissions , and derived the conditions that concurrent transmissions always outperform tdma .",
    "@xcite proposed a multi - hop concurrent transmission scheme ( mhct ) to address the link outage problem ( blockage ) and combat large path loss to improve flow throughput .",
    "for bursty traffic , tdma based protocols face the problem that the medium access time for a flow is often highly unpredictable , which will result in over - allocated medium access time for some users while under - allocated medium access time for others .",
    "besides , tdma based protocols may also have high control overhead for medium reservation .",
    "there is some other work based on a central coordinator to coordinate the transmissions in wpans @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a directional csma / ca protocol , which exploits virtual carrier sensing , and depends on the piconet coordinator ( pnc ) to distribute the network allocation vector ( nav ) information .",
    "it mainly focuses on solving the deafness problem and does not exploit the spatial reuse fully .",
    "recently , son _",
    "@xcite proposed a frame based directional mac protocol ( fdmac ) .",
    "the high efficiency of fdmac is achieved by amortizing the scheduling overhead over multiple concurrent transmissions in a row .",
    "the core of fdmac is the greedy coloring algorithm , which fully exploits spatial reuse and greatly improves the network throughput compared with mrdmac @xcite and memory - guided directional mac ( mdmac ) @xcite .",
    "fdmac also has a good fairness performance and low complexity .",
    "@xcite proposed a multihop relay directional mac protocol ( mrdmac ) , which overcomes the deafness problem by pnc s weighted round robin scheduling . in mrdmac , if a wireless terminal ( wt ) is lost due to blockage , the access point ( ap ) will choose a live wt to act as a relay to the lost wt .",
    "since most transmissions are through the pnc , mrdmac does not consider the spatial reuse .",
    "@xcite proposed a directional cooperative mac protocol , d - coopmac , to coordinate the uplink channel access in an ieee 802.11ad wlan .",
    "d - coopmac selects a relay for a direct link , and when the two - hop link outperforms the direct link , the latter will be replaced by the former .",
    "spatial reuse is also not considered in d - coopmac since most transmissions go through the ap .",
    "all the work above considers scheduling in the access network , and does not consider the backhaul network . for the small cell networks in the mmwave band , since the backhaul network becomes the bottleneck , the backhaul and access networks should be considered jointly to promote the spatial reuse and perform efficient interference management both within and among cells .",
    "on the other hand , there is also some related work on wireless backhaul networks .",
    "@xcite identified advantages of the 60 ghz band for short - range mobile backhaul through feasibility analysis and comparison with the e - band technology .",
    "@xcite performed the joint cost optimal aggregator node placement , power allocation , channel scheduling and routing to optimize the wireless backhaul network in mmwave bands .",
    "@xcite discussed advanced wireless and optical technologies for small - cell mobile backhaul with dynamic software - defined management in 60 ghz band and e - band .",
    "@xcite discussed the main challenges to design the backhaul and radio access network jointly in a cloud - based mobile network .",
    "design ideas involving the physical layer , the mac layer , and the network layer are proposed .",
    "most of the work on the backhaul above does not consider the access network , and fails to give a joint design of scheduling over the access and backhaul networks .",
    "besides , direct transmissions between devices are also not exploited to improve network performance in the work above . to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to consider the transmission scheduling over both access and backhaul networks jointly , and also exploit the device - to - device transmission for performance improvement .    as regards small cells in the mmwave band , most work focused on using bands such as 28ghz , 38ghz and 73ghz to attain ranges of the order of 200 m or even more @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a 60ghz picocell architecture to augment existing lte networks for significant increase in capacity .",
    "the feasibility of this architecture is investigated by characterizing range , attenuation due to reflections , sensitivity to movement and blockage , and interference in typical urban environments . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the oxygen absorption that peaks at 60ghz is not a barrier to high - capacity 60ghz outdoor picocells , and can even promote spatial reuse due to less interference from faraway base stations .",
    "we consider the scenario that multiple small cells are deployed . in each small cell , there are several wireless nodes ( wns ) and an access point ( ap ) , which synchronizes the clocks of wns and provides access services within the cell . the aps form a wireless backhaul network in the mmwave band , which should be stationary . also , the backhaul links between aps are able to be optimized in order to achieve high channel quality and reduce interference .",
    "there are some aps connected to the internet via a direct and high speed wired connection , which are called _ gateways_.",
    "the remaining aps should communicate with the gateways to send ( receive ) data to ( from ) internet .",
    "the backhaul network can form arbitrary topology like ring topology , star topology , or tree topology @xcite , where the backhaul paths between aps should be optimized to maximize backhaul efficiency . to overcome huge attenuation in the mmwave band ,",
    "both the wns and aps achieve directional transmissions with electronically steerable directional antennas by the beamforming techniques @xcite .",
    "in such a system of small cells networks , we schedule the transmission of the access and backhaul networks jointly , which apparently differs from the scheduling problem of the ad - hoc network",
    ".    in this paper , we adopt centralized control . on one hand , distributed control does not scale well @xcite , and the latency will increase significantly with the number of aps , which is unsuitable for mmwave communication systems where a time slot only lasts for a few microseconds .",
    "moreover , distributed control is difficult to achieve intelligent control mechanisms required for the complex operational environments that involve dynamic behaviors of accessing users and temporal variations of the communication links . on the other hand ,",
    "centralized control is able to achieve flexible control in an optimized manner @xcite .",
    "there is a centralized controller in the network , which usually resides on a gateway and is similar to the central coordinator in ieee 802.11ad @xcite .",
    "the system is partitioned into non - overlapping time slots of equal length , and the controller synchronizes the clocks of aps .",
    "then the clocks of wns are synchronized by their corresponding aps .",
    "there is a bootstrapping program in the system , by which the central controller knows the up - to - date network topology and the location information of aps and wns .",
    "the network topology can be obtained by the neighbor discovery schemes in @xcite .",
    "location information of nodes can be obtained based on wireless channel signatures , such as angle of arrival ( aoa ) , time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) , or the received signal strength ( rss ) @xcite . in our system",
    ", the bootstrapping program adopts the direct discovery scheme to discover the network topology @xcite . in the direct discovery scheme ,",
    "a node is in the transmitting or receiving state at the beginning of each time slot . in the transmitting state ,",
    "a node transmits a broadcast packet with its identity in a randomly chosen direction . in the receiving state",
    ", a node listens for broadcast packets from a randomly chosen direction .",
    "if a collision happens , the node fails to discover any neighbor ; otherwise , if the transmitter is unknown , the receiver discovers a new neighbor by recording the angle of arrival ( aoa ) and the transmitter s identity .",
    "after the direct discovery , the nodes report discovered neighbors to the aps , and then aps report obtained topology information to the central controller .",
    "at the same time , the aps obtain the location information of wns by a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) classifier based on changes in the second - order statistics and sparsity patterns of the beamspace multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) channel matrix @xcite . besides",
    ", in the heterogeneous cellular networks scenario , the location information can also be obtained by the cellular geolocation from cellular base stations in @xcite if the macrocell is coupled with the small cells to some extent .",
    "then the central controller obtains the location information of nodes from the aps . with relatively low mobility",
    ", the network topology and location information will be updated periodically .",
    "there are two kinds of flows transmitted in the network , flows between wns and flows from or to the internet ( gateway ) . specifically , we assume there are @xmath0 flows with traffic transmission demand in the network .",
    "for flow @xmath1 , its traffic demand is denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "the traffic demand vector for all flows is denoted as @xmath3 , a @xmath4 matrix whose @xmath1th element is @xmath2 . for each flow , there are two possible transmission paths in our system , the ordinary path and direct path .",
    "the ordinary path is the transmission path through aps , which may includes the access link from the source to its associated ap , the backhaul path from the source s associated ap to the destination s associated ap or the gateway , and the access link from the destination s associated ap to the destination .",
    "we also assume the backhaul path from the source s associated ap to the destination s associated ap across the backhaul network is pre - determined by some criterion , such as the criterion of minimum number of hops , or maximum minimum transmission rate on the backhaul path . for the @xmath5th hop link of the ordinary path for flow @xmath1 ,",
    "we denote its sender as @xmath6 and receiver as @xmath7 , and denote this link as @xmath8 .",
    "the direct path is the direct transmission path from the source to the destination , which does not pass through the backhaul network and only has one hop .",
    "we denote the direct link of flow @xmath1 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the source , and @xmath11 is the destination .    for each flow @xmath1 , its transmission rate vector on the ordinary path",
    "is denoted as @xmath12 , where each element @xmath13 represents the transmission rate of the @xmath5th hop on the ordinary path . the maximum number of hops of the ordinary paths is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "we also denote the transmission rate matrix for the ordinary paths of flows as @xmath15 , where the @xmath1th row of @xmath15 is @xmath12 and @xmath15 is an @xmath16 matrix .",
    "the transmission rate of the direct path for flow @xmath1 is denoted as @xmath17 , and the transmission rate vector for the direct paths of flows is denoted as @xmath18 , a @xmath4 matrix whose @xmath1th element is @xmath17 .    in the los case , the achievable maximum transmission rates of links can be estimated according to shannon s channel capacity @xcite . in our system",
    ", the transmission rates on the ordinary paths and direct paths can be obtained via a channel transmission rate measurement procedure @xcite . in this procedure , the transmitter of each link transmits measurement packets to the receiver first .",
    "then with the measured signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of received packets , the receiver estimates the achievable transmission rate , and appropriate modulation and coding scheme by the correspondence table about snr and modulation and coding scheme . under low user mobility",
    ", the procedure is usually executed periodically . besides , since the aps are not mobile and positioned high above to avoid blockage @xcite , the transmission rates of backhaul links can be assumed fixed for a relatively long period of time .    with directional transmissions ,",
    "there is less interference between links . under low multi - user interference ( mui )",
    "@xcite , concurrent transmissions can be supported . in the system ,",
    "all nodes are assumed to be half - duplex , and two adjacent links can not be scheduled concurrently since each node has at most one connection with one neighbor @xcite . for two nonadjacent links ,",
    "we adopt the interference model in @xcite and @xcite . for link @xmath19 and link @xmath20 ,",
    "the received power from @xmath21 to @xmath22 can be calculated as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the transmission power that is fixed , @xmath25 is the constant scaling factor corresponding to the reference path loss @xmath26 with @xmath27 equal to 1 m , @xmath28 is the distance between node @xmath21 and node @xmath22 , and @xmath29 is the path loss exponent @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 indicates whether @xmath21 and @xmath22 direct their beams towards each other .",
    "if it is , @xmath31 ; otherwise , @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , @xmath32 if and only if any transmitter is outside the beamwidth of the other receiver or does not direct its beam to the other receiver if it is within the beamwidth of the other receiver @xcite .",
    "thus , the sinr at @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath33 , can be calculated as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mui factor related to the cross correlation of signals from different links , @xmath36 is the bandwidth , and @xmath37 is the onesided power spectra density of white gaussian noise @xcite . for link @xmath19 , the minimum sinr to support its transmission rate @xmath38 is denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , concurrent transmissions can be supported if the sinr of each link @xmath19 is larger than or equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the operation of d2dmac is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ frame ] .",
    "d2dmac is a frame based mac protocol as fdmac @xcite .",
    "each frame consists of a scheduling phase and a transmission phase , and the scheduling overhead in the scheduling phase can be amortized over multiple concurrent transmissions in the transmission phase as in @xcite . in the scheduling phase , after the wns of each cell steer their antennas towards their associated ap , each ap polls its associated wns successively for their traffic demand .",
    "then each ap reports the traffic demand of its associated wns to the central controller on the gateway through the backhaul network .",
    "we denote the time for the central controller to collect the traffic demand as @xmath40 .",
    "based on the transmission rates of links , the central controller computes a schedule to accommodate the traffic demand of all flows , which takes time @xmath41 .",
    "then the central controller pushes the schedule to the aps through the backhaul network .",
    "afterwards , each ap pushes the schedule to its associated wns .",
    "we denote the time for the central controller to push the schedule to the aps and wns as @xmath42 . in the transmission phase ,",
    "wns and aps communicate with each other following the schedule until the traffic demand of all flows is accommodated .",
    "the transmission phase consists of multiple stages , and in each stage , multiple links are activated simultaneously for concurrent transmissions . in the schedule computation ,",
    "first the transmission path should be selected optimally between the direct path and ordinary path for each flow .",
    "then , the schedule should accommodate the traffic demand of flows with a minimum number of time slots , which indicates concurrent transmissions ( spatial reuse ) should be fully exploited .",
    "[ htbp ]          to maximize the transmission efficiency in the above introduced operation procedure , the traffic demand of flows should be accommodated with a minimum number of time slots in the transmission phase . to achieve this",

    "conversely , the throughput of d2dmac increases linearly with the traffic load . under poisson traffic",
