    "since the first detections of soft x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite , and radio @xcite afterglows to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , 19 optical afterglows have been detected .",
    "for the current sample of 12 grbs with well - determined redshifts , the median redshift is z@xmath4 = 1.1 with a very large root - mean - square variation of @xmath50.8 .",
    "while a photometric redshift of @xmath6 5 has been proposed for @xcite , the highest spectroscopic redshift determination for a grb so far is @xmath7 for grb  971214 @xcite .",
    "this redshift was determined from the spectrum of a faint lyman break galaxy that was found at the position of the optical afterglow ( see also odewahn et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the highest redshift determined directly from absorption lines in the spectrum of an optical afterglow is @xmath8 for @xcite .",
    "several authors have speculated about the possibility of detecting grbs at even higher redshifts than achieved so far .",
    "wijers et al .",
    "@xcite and lamb & reichart  @xcite estimate that grbs should be detectable at very high redshifts ( @xmath9 ) based on the assumption that grbs are associated with star formation and by using models for the cosmic star formation rate as a function of redshift .",
    "blain & natarajan  @xcite propose to use the opposite strategy , namely to use the observed redshift distribution of grbs to measure the ( uncertain ) cosmic star formation rate as a function of redshift .",
    "unfortunately , afterglows have been detected in only @xmath10 percent of all well - localized ( sax , rxte , ipn ) grbs ( e.g. , fynbo et al .",
    "it is not clear why most grbs with no apparent optical afterglow ( ` dark bursts ' ) are so abundant .",
    "possible explanations are rapid decay @xcite , reddening in the immediate environment and host galaxy ( eg . , jensen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , intrinsic optical faintness @xcite , very high redshifts @xcite or a combination of these effects . to shed light on dark bursts ,",
    "one obvious strategy is to set deeper optical limits by using large telescopes and to determine the decay slopes and colours ( see fynbo et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this letter",
    "we present the first attempt to identify the afterglow of a grb with an 8-m class telescope .",
    "the attempt was successful in that the observations led to the discovery of the afterglow and the subsequent determination of the decay slope , spectral energy distribution and record high redshift . in the following we document the gamma - ray , optical , and infrared observations , and discuss the properties of the gamma - ray burst and afterglow .",
    "grb 000131 was observed by ulysses , konus / wind , near , and cgro - batse on 2000 jan .",
    "31.624 ut . after 56 hours , it was localized via interplanetary network ( ipn ) timing to two alternate 55 sq .",
    "arcmin error boxes ( hurley et al . , 2000a ) , one of which was ruled out by the independent batse location @xcite . from the ulysses , konus / wind , and near data its 25100 kev fluence was @xmath11 erg/@xmath12 .",
    "batse detected the event ( trigger # 7975 ) in a partial data gap , so the standard catalog data products such as flux , fluence , and duration are not available .",
    "however , by analyzing other data types from batse the relevant parameters could be estimated .",
    "the results are given in table  [ batse_data.tab ] .",
    "the peak flux is in the top 5@xmath13 , and the fluence in the top 7@xmath13 of all batse grbs .",
    "the spectrum is well fit by a standard grb model @xcite and shows a typical spectral evolution @xcite .",
    ".spectral data from batse [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ alpha_and_betas.tab ]      the optical afterglow was detected in vrihk , but at different epochs . by assuming achromatic evolution of the afterglow ( which is consistent with other afterglows ) , following the @xmath0 = 2.25 power - law decline",
    ", the spectral energy distribution can be calculated for a given epoch . in fig .",
    "[ sed.fig ] we plot the derived spectral energy distribution at 3.50 days after the burst trigger , i.e. , at the time of the first vri observations . also given are the upper limits derived from our b and j observations .",
    "the spectral energy distribution has been corrected for galactic reddening , using e@xmath14=0.056 @xcite .    for steep - decay afterglows , like those shown in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve.fig ] , the large values of @xmath0 and the relatively small values of @xmath15 favour a scenario involving a sideways expanding jet . in this case",
    "spectral slopes between @xmath16 and @xmath17 are expected in the fireball model , depending on the value of the cooling frequency . with @xmath18 ,",
    "this implies @xmath19 , with a preference for the low value ( cf .",
    "table  [ alpha_and_betas.tab ] ) .    the spectral energy distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ sed.fig ] does not resemble a power - law with a single index @xmath15 .",
    "this is not an artifact of extrapolating the h and k band data points from feb .",
    "8 to feb .  4 , as a power - law fit to the v , r , and i data points only results in a @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which is much steeper than the value of about 1 typically observed in grb afterglows ( see table  [ alpha_and_betas.tab ] )",
    "moreover , for the h and k fluxes to be in accordance with this fit , an unphysical value of @xmath0 of about 7.0 in the near - ir is required .",
    "thus , a power - law spectral energy distribution is ruled out .",
    "we have explored whether the strongly curved shape of the spectral energy distribution can be explained by reddening in the host galaxy ( as in eg .  , jensen et al .",
    "2000 , or in , dal fiume et al .",
    "we find that no physically plausible reddening laws can transform a power - law spectrum into the observed shape .",
    "the most likely interpretation of the spectral break is therefore the onset of lyman forest blanketing , hence implying that was at a high redshift ( z@xmath224 ) . to examine this interpretation",
    "further we have fitted the spectral energy distribution with power - laws modified by the effects of lyman forest blanketing and internal reddening in the host galaxy .",
    "this technique was first used by fruchter @xcite for and discussed in detail by reichart @xcite . for the reddening we use",
    "the smc extinction law assumed to best represent a chemically less - evolved environment at redshifts of 4 to 5 . to model the effects of lyman forest blanketing we follow mller and jakobsen  @xcite : for each pair of values of @xmath15 and @xmath23 , the visual rest - frame absorption a@xmath24 and the @xmath25 of the fit is obtained .",
    "we find that all values of @xmath15 allowed by the fireball model are possible , with a preference for low values .",
    "the corresponding range of internal reddening is 0.11 @xmath3 a@xmath24 @xmath3 0.20 , with a preference for high values . for values of @xmath15 around 0.65 ,",
    "the possible range ( 2 @xmath26 ) of redshifts is @xmath27 , while the redshift is @xmath28 for @xmath15 = 1.0 .",
    "this result is not affected by the choice of reddening law .",
    "our analysis of the photometric observations implies the presence of a ly@xmath0 absorption edge in the range 6500   to 6900   .",
    "this implication is confirmed by the spectroscopic observations .",
    "after smoothing the fors1 spectrum to a resolution of 30   a clear indication of such an absorption edge at 6700   is revealed .",
    "the recorded spectrum was very faint , at the level of less than 2% of the continuum of the night sky , which is dominated by emission lines through the red part of the spectrum .",
    "the noise in the spectrum is therefore dominated by uncertainty in the sky subtraction .",
    "an improved representation of the continuum was obtained by rebinning the spectrum to a resolution of 200   , omitting spectral bins coincident with sky lines .",
    "the smoothed and the rebinned spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum.fig ] together with a model of the spectrum , assuming a redshift of 4.5 , @xmath15 = 0.70 and a reddening , a@xmath29 , as derived from a fit to the photometry ( see fig .  [ sed.fig ] ) .",
    "the model spectrum is normalized to the r - magnitude of the afterglow , obtained immediately before the spectroscopic observations began , and corrected for slit losses of 35% , as would result from using a 07 slit in a seeing of about 07 .",
    "the model spectrum is seen to be in very good agreement with the binned spectrum for wavelengths below 7200   .",
    "the average observed flux in the lyman forest region ( between ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath15 ) is @xmath30  njy , which is in reasonable agreement with the level of 79  njy predicted by the model .",
    "beyond 7200   the spectrum is dominated by an atmospheric band and strong sky lines , which are not well resolved at a spectral resolution of 9   .",
    "this effectively renders the spectrum useless in this spectral region .    as the spectral region from 6590   to 6810",
    " is essentially free from sky lines , the location of the absorption edge is well defined ( see fig .",
    "[ lyman_edge.fig ] ) .",
    "we measure its location to be at @xmath31   from which a redshift of @xmath32 is inferred .",
    "the reality of the absorption edge and the interpretation that it is due to ly@xmath0 is most convincingly seen by integrating the flux of the spectrum and the model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lyman_edge.fig ] .",
    "the integrated spectrum is very smooth and follows the model nicely on the red side of the edge , while there are significant deviations on the blue side of the edge .",
    "comparing 100   intervals on the blue and red side of the absorption edge , the standard deviation of the spectrum is found to be 65% larger on the blue side , consistent with the interpretation that the blue side is located in the lyman forest .",
    "hence , the vlt spectrum is in excellent agreement with the photometric observations and provides independent evidence that the redshift of grb  000131 is @xmath33 .    in the vlt spectrum of , jensen et al .",
    "@xcite detected a strong damped ly@xmath0 absorption line at the redshift of the grb .",
    "if a similar damped ly@xmath0 absorption line is present in the spectrum of the redshift as determined from the spectral break will be slightly overestimated since the red wing of the damping profile will move the spectral break 1020    ( depending on the column density ) towards the red .",
    "therefore , the inferred redshift from the spectral break depends on the assumed column density of the grb self absorption . with the signal - to - noise of the spectrum ,",
    "it is not possible to constrain the column density .",
    "an indirect indication that had significant self absorption is obtained from the estimate of a@xmath34 . assuming an smc extinction law and minimum dust - to - gas ratio @xcite and the maximum value of a@xmath34 , as derived from the fit of the spectral energy distribution , an column density of up to @xmath35  @xmath36 is estimated .",
    "an estimate of the likely error of the redshift may therefore be obtained by fitting a line corresponding to this column density to the spectrum .",
    "we derive a redshift of 4.490  @xmath370.002 for this column density , which allows us to conservatively conclude that the redshift of is @xmath38 .",
    "based on the temporal and positional coincidence of the transient object with , and the fact that it was located at a cosmological distance , we conclude that this transient object was the optical afterglow of . assuming a hubble constant of 65 km  s@xmath39  mpc@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , a redshift of 4.50 implies a distance modulus of 48.24 .",
    "hence , the total energy release assuming isotropic emission is @xmath61.1@xmath4210@xmath43 erg .",
    "this is only a factor of @xmath53 smaller than the isotropic equivalent energy for the most energetic event so far , @xcite .",
    "however , the combination of the decay slope @xmath0 and the constraints on the spectral slope @xmath15 indicate that the afterglow was due to a collimated jet . the upper limit on the break epoch",
    ", t@xmath44 @xmath3 3.5 days , implies a lower limit on the jet opening angle of @xmath45 7@xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 7@xmath46 , where @xmath49 is the density of the ambient medium ( in units of @xmath50 ) , which is larger than 1 in star - forming regions . from the lower limit on the opening angle",
    "we infer a lower limit on the released energy of @xmath51 erg .",
    "this work shows that 8-m class telescopes may be used successfully to detect faint r  @xmath52 optical afterglows even in fields with very bright stars .",
    "this is necessary in order to resolve why @xmath53 of all attempts to detect optical afterglows of grbs are currently unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "the apparent brightness of the afterglow was similar to that of .",
    "does therefore provide the first observational evidence that it is possible to obtain high resolution optical spectra of grbs at very high redshift , if the afterglow is identified at an early time .",
    "high redshift grbs will therefore no doubt prove to be an extremely valuable tool for not only the understanding of the grb environment but also for the study of the lyman forest and of cosmology .",
