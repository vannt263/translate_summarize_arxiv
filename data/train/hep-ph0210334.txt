    "these analyses are often model dependent and can sometimes lead to ambiguous results .    in 1997",
    "a study of the @xmath1 reaction on a polarized target has been performed in the @xmath2 effective mass between 600 and 1600 mev giving four solutions for the @xmath0 scalar - isoscalar phase shifts below 1 gev  @xcite . using the unitarity constraint two  steep \" solutions were rejected and the two remaining ones , called  down - flat \" and  up - flat \" , passed this test  @xcite .",
    "elimination of this remaining ambiguity is necessary for extension of studies done near the @xmath0 threshold and above using chiral perturbation models based on qcd ( see for example @xcite ) .    a steady increase of the @xmath0 scalar - isoscalar phase shifts below 1 gev can be interpreted as due to the presence of a broad @xmath3-meson  @xcite .",
    "previous elimination of  steep \" solutions excludes a narrow @xmath3 with a width comparable to that of the @xmath4-meson  @xcite . in this channel , near the @xmath5 threshold and above it , other resonances exist which could be mixed  with  glueball  states  predicted  by  qcd .    in order to eliminate the above mentioned  up - down \" ambiguity",
    "one can check if the corresponding amplitudes satisfy crossing symmetry .",
    "roy s equations  @xcite can serve as a tool to perform this check .",
    "they also correlate different experimental phase shifts determined near the @xmath0 threshold and at higher energy , in particular for the scalar - isoscalar , @xmath6 , the scalar - isotensor , @xmath7 , and the vector - isovector , @xmath8 , @xmath0 partial waves .",

    "the changes from the breit - wigner form , that we used , do not affect the phase shifts in all three partial waves by more than one degree below 970 mev . in the @xmath6 case the regge contributions are of the order of a few percent of the resonance contributions .",
