    "this is a useful way to understand stellar mass accumulation in nscs in general , which is very likely connected to the formation and growth of mbhs at their centers @xcite .",
    "there are two fundamental scenarios for the accumulation of stars in nscs .",

    "observational results and theoretical arguments suggest that both mechanisms are necessary to explain the morphology , kinematics and complex star formation history of nsc stellar populations @xcite .",

    "this disk is thought to have formed in - situ from the fragmentation of in - falling or colliding gas clumps at the gc @xcite .",
    "we refer to this structure as the `` young cw disk '' .",
    "one also observes a population of fainter b - stars , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 corresponds to a b0v star ) , which are not obviously associated with this disk .",
    "they appear more isotropically distributed than the brighter stars , though a number may be members of the young cw disk @xcite .",
    "they are not truncated in projected radius at the disk inner edge , but continue inwards to the mbh .",
    "those that lie within the central @xmath22 are collectively referred to as the `` s - stars '' ; their kinematics reveal randomly - inclined and near - thermal eccentricity orbits @xcite .",
    "the orbits of the b - stars further out have not yet been determined and it is unclear whether or not the s - stars and the outermost b - stars form distinct populations .",
    "their ages range from a spectroscopically confirmed @xmath23 for the s - star s2/s0 - 2 @xcite , to an upper - limit of @xmath24 on the main sequence lifetime of the lower - mass b - stars .",
    "this upper limit does not preclude the b - stars forming contemporaneously with the young cw stars , but they may well derive from an older starburst or even form a continuous distribution in age .    the proximity of the s - stars to the mbh , which prohibits in - situ star formation due to its immense tidal force @xcite , combined with their young ages imply a `` paradox of youth '' @xcite .",
    "arguably , the most plausible theory for their origin is the tidal capture by sgra * of in - falling b - star binaries by hills mechanism @xcite , following dynamical relaxation by massive perturbers such as giant molecular clouds @xcite within the central @xmath25 . in this theory , the s - stars are captured on orbits of very high orbital eccentricity whilst their binary companions may be ejected as hypervelocity stars ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "it is possible that the b - stars outside the central arcsecond also formed via hills mechanism , as proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pg10 ) .",
    "however , as the latter authors point out , the initial high - eccentricity distribution must persist , since neither two - body nor resonant relaxation will be able to significantly change the orbital eccentricities of the b - stars at large radii within their lifetimes .",

    "the stars with the highest @xmath5-magnitudes in our sample , @xmath219 , have similar @xmath52-distributions to those with @xmath218 with a ks value of @xmath269 .",
    "they have lower @xmath52-values at large radii , @xmath270 . if they are isotropically distributed , they are more eccentric than those located closer in projected distance to the mbh",
    ". stars with @xmath219 and @xmath231 do not appear to be drawn from the same distribution as those with @xmath219 and @xmath228 ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "in context of the _ binary disruption _",
    "scenario , this can be explained by the decreasing relaxation times as orbits get closer to the mbh , which rapidly changes their low angular momenta and hence @xmath52-values .",
    "we would like to increase our sample of @xmath219 stars to confirm this result .",
    "8 .   in comparing the observed b - star data with simulations of the two formation scenarios ,",
    "we find the following : stars with @xmath216 have higher @xmath52-values than expected for a thermal distribution and hence fit better with the _ dissolved disk _ scenario . given the short lifetimes for these stars ( @xmath272 ) , they are most likely members of the recent star formation episode which created with young cw disk .",
    "fainter b - stars with @xmath9 , and hence longer lifetimes , have lower @xmath52-values than expected for a thermal distribution and for that reason fit better with hills _ binary disruption _ scenario , though the data are not as eccentric ( if isotropically distributed ) as in most of the simulations .",
    "the best match to the data involves a steep stellar cusp such that coherence times for stellar torques are high at large radii , and/or a larger mass of the young cw disk ( @xmath273 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario for the origin of the b - stars is formation in the same star formation episode that formed the young cw disk @xcite . to explain the low @xmath52-values of the high - magnitude stars however , there must exist a mechanism which differentiates between low- and high - mass stars in orbital eccentricity and/or inclination , and it must act on a short timescale .",
    "@xcite show that , for an initially circular disk , energy relaxation between stars of different masses can significantly change the velocity dispersion of different populations of stars of different masses , and hence change their orbital eccentricities .",
    "we repeat their analysis and find that , though important for low and moderately eccentric disks ( @xmath274 ) , this mechanism can not account for the magnitude of the difference in @xmath48-values of the low and high @xmath5-magnitude stars .",
    "it is important to obtain more observations of b - star positions and proper motions , particularly those at high @xmath5-magnitude and large projected radii , to increase the sample - size that can be used in comparison with simulations .",
    "recent observations show that the oldest stars observable in the gc , red giants , do not form a cusp within @xmath275 of the mbh , in contradiction with theoretical predictions ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "whether or not this result is specific to the red giant population or true also of the less luminous stellar distribution is important for nsc formation and evolution theory .",
    "if the high magnitude b - stars originate from the _ binary disruption _",
    "scenario , the shape of the @xmath156-@xmath157 relation can be a probe of the mass distribution of the dark stellar cluster .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath52 for a bound stellar orbit is calculated by limiting the velocity of a star to the escape velocity at its projected radius .",
    "the maximum angular momentum of a stellar orbit on the plane of sky is @xmath277 and therefore , @xmath278 for a bound kepler orbit , @xmath279 .",
    "one can use this constraint to find unbound stars and/or stars affected by confusion with incorrect proper motion values .",
    "+ a star with @xmath280 has a @xmath49 value larger than the circular angular momentum at its projected radius .",
    "this requires that @xmath281 , but moreover that @xmath282 , i.e. , that the star s semi - major axis is larger than its projected radius .",
    "this star is traveling on the inner part of its orbit , closer to periapsis than apoapsis .",
    "this may provide an extra constraint on @xmath34 , the position of a star along the line - of - sight , when estimating stellar orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48-statistic is defined for a kepler orbit ( @xmath283 ) . in a real nsc ,",
    "the mass contained within a stellar orbit is due to both the black hole mass and the enclosed mass of the stellar cusp .",
    "if we do not take the latter mass into account , our theoretical value of @xmath284 , the maximum angular momentum at @xmath33 , will be smaller than the true value .",
    "hence , @xmath52 will appear artificially larger ( i.e. a stellar orbit will appear less eccentric or more ` face - on ' ) than its true value . due to the increasing enclosed stellar mass with radius ,",
    "this effect will increase with radius .",
    "we quantify this in figure [ fig_stellarmass ] where we plot the fraction of two evaluations of @xmath48 ( one takes stellar mass into account in calculating @xmath284 , @xmath285 , the other does not , @xmath286 ) for a face - on circular orbit ( @xmath287 ) .",
    "we assume a stellar mass of @xmath288 within @xmath289 and vary the power - law index @xmath70 , where the mass within radius @xmath157 scales as @xmath290 . from this simple analysis",
    "we see that a star with a face - on circular orbit at @xmath291 , will have a @xmath48-value that is fractionally larger by ( @xmath292 ) than for a kepler potential for this particular power - law density profile with @xmath293 .",
    "this plot can inform us on the magnitude of the expected error on @xmath48 due to the stellar cusp .",
    "there is a degeneracy in the value of @xmath48 with respect to orbital eccentricity and inclination .",
    "however , if we assume a known distribution for one of the parameters we can place constraints on the mapping of the other to @xmath48 . for example , we can take a cut in inclination ( see figure [ fig_inc ] ) and see how the range in @xmath48-values map to orbital eccentricity .",
