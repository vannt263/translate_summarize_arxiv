    "in several recent papers [ 1 - 4 ] we have developed a highly predictive model of quark and lepton masses based on the grand unified group @xmath0 .",
    "this model grew out of our attempt @xcite to construct a realistic grand unified theory ( gut ) in which @xmath0 was broken down to the standard model in the simplest possible , or  minimal \" way @xcite . in this model there emerged a new mechanism based on certain well - known features of @xmath2 for explaining the large mixing between the mu and tau neutrinos that is seen at superkamiokande@xcite .",
    "in @xcite we gave the structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices for the second and third families , treating the first family as massless .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown how to extend the model to include the first family , which leads to several interesting predictions . in @xcite , it was observed that the mixing of the electron neutrino very naturally falls either within the range @xmath3 , corresponding to the small angle msw solution @xcite of the solar neutrino problem , or very near to the value @xmath4 , corresponding to what is called  bimaximal mixing \" .",
    "in this paper we present the model in fuller detail , especially in regard to neutrino phenomenology , and to the structure of the higgs sector , yukawa interactions , and flavor symmetries that underlie the quark and lepton mass matrices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss in general terms , that is apart from a particular model , our mechanism for explaining the large mixing of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in section iii , we explain what we mean by a  minimal \" @xmath0 breaking scheme , and show how such minimal breaking and the requirements of simplicity lead one naturally to a certain form for the mass terms of the heavier two families of quarks and leptons .",
    "we then observe that this form realizes the general mechanism for large @xmath7 mixing described in the previous section .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this mechanism emerged not from an attempt to explain neutrino phenomenology , but from other considerations entirely , in particular the attempt to simplify the higgs structure of @xmath0 .",
    "it is most interesting that the same mechanism has also independently been found by other groups attempting to make sense of neutrino phenomenology . in section iv",
    ", it will be explained how this model is best extended to the first family of quarks and leptons , and how this gives rise to several distinctive predictions .",
    "accurate analytic expressions for the predictions at the gut scale will be presented . in section",
    "v , the neutrino sector will be examined in detail .",
    "it will be seen how either the small - angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem or bimaximal mixing can result with equal simplicity .",
    "finally , in section vi , a concrete model , including all the details of flavor symmetries and of the higgs and yukawa superpotentials , will be presented , showing that the basic scheme is technically natural .",
    "before explaining our mechanism , it will be helpful to explain why the observed large mixing of @xmath8 , presumably with @xmath6 , has been a theoretical puzzle .",
    "the basic reason is simple : the mixing that is seen between the quarks of the second and third families is described by a small mixing angle , namely @xmath9 , and therefore it was expected that the mixing between the second and third family of leptons would also be small .    the grounds for this expectation were twofold",
    "first , there is the empirical fact that the masses of the quarks and leptons exhibit roughly similar  hierarchical \" patterns , and therefore it was natural to assume that their mixing angles would be similar also .",
    "second , the most promising theoretical approaches to understanding the pattern of quark and lepton masses , namely grand unification and flavor symmetry , tend to treat quarks and leptons in similar ways .",
    "for instance , small quark mixing angles might suggest an underlying fundamental  family symmetry \" that is weakly broken , in which case the lepton mixings might be expected also to be small .",
    "and in grand unification based on @xmath0 there is a close connection between the quark and lepton mass matrices .",
    "there are actually two puzzles associated with the mixing of the second and third families : first , why is the lepton mixing @xmath10 so large",
    "? and , second , why is the quark mixing @xmath9 so small ?",
    "what we mean by saying that these are distinct puzzles is that they are both unexpected within the most commonly assumed framework for explaining quark and lepton masses , the weinberg - wilczek - zee - fritzsch ( wwzf ) idea @xcite .",
    "the wwzf idea was that the cabibbo angle could be understood if the mass matrices of the first and second families of quarks had the following form :    @xmath11    this gives @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and thus the famous relation    @xmath15    since @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , this relation is satisfied for @xmath19 .",
    "if we apply the same idea to the leptons of the first two families we get    @xmath20    the second term on the right is not known , but if it is assumed to be small one has the rough prediction that @xmath21 .",
    "this could be consistent with the small angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem , which requires that @xmath22 .",
    "thus the wwzf idea appears to work well where it was originally applied , namely to the first and second families .",
    "fritzsch @xcite later extended this idea to explain the mixing of the third family . if a wwzf form is assumed to hold for the second and third family , i.e. , if one takes @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , one obtains    @xmath25    and    @xmath26    since @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , one sees that the observed value of @xmath9 is too small by a factor of three or so . assuming that the neutrino mass ratio in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is small , and given that @xmath29 , one sees that the nearly maximal value of @xmath30 that is observed is too large by a factor of three or so .",
    "these eqs .",
    "( 2 - 5 ) are based on the assumption of a hierarchical and symmetric form for the mass matrices .",
    "a key feature in our mechanism for understanding the large mixing of the tau neutrino is that it involves highly asymmetric mass matrices .",
    "as we shall see , the assumption of asymmetric mass matrices naturally explains why @xmath31 is larger than the fritzsch value and @xmath32 is smaller than the fritzsch value by approximately the same factor .",
    "consider , a toy model with @xmath2 symmetry , which has a set of yukawa terms of the following form : @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and the subscript @xmath35 denoting a higgs representation .",
    "these terms yield the following mass matrices for the second and third families of down quarks and charged leptons :    @xmath36    with @xmath37 .",
    "here we have labelled the fermions with a family index , instead of the names @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , since the mass matrices in this case are far from diagonal . a crucial point to notice",
    "is that the matrix for the leptons , which we will denote by @xmath42 , is the transpose of the matrix for the down quarks , which we will denote by @xmath43 .",
    "this is a feature of minimal @xmath2 .",
    "it arises from the fact that the @xmath44 representation of fermions contains the left - handed leptons , @xmath45 , and the charge conjugate of the right - handed down - quarks , @xmath46 , while the @xmath47 representation of fermions contains the charge conjugate of the right - handed leptons , @xmath48 , and the left - handed down - quarks , @xmath49 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 relates @xmath43 to @xmath42 , but only up to a left - right transposition : @xmath50 .    the transposition feature of @xmath2 unification appearing in eq . ( 6 )",
    "results in the large element , @xmath51 , of @xmath42 producing an o(1 ) mixing of @xmath52 with @xmath53 for the leptons , while in @xmath43 for the quarks it produces a large mixing of the right - handed fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the mismatch between the large @xmath56 mixing and the @xmath57 mixing , which is small ( as will soon be seen ) , leads to a large @xmath31 mixing element .",
    "but the right - handed mixings of the quarks are not observable through standard model physics .",
    "what matters is the left - handed mixing of @xmath58 with @xmath59 , which contributes to @xmath32 , and is controlled by the small parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the common statement that grand unification relates quark and lepton mixing angles , and thus @xmath32 to @xmath31 , is very misleading .",
    "what is really true in general is that grand unification relates the mixing of quarks of one handedness to the mixing of leptons of the other handedness .",
    "thus @xmath32 and @xmath31 need not be directly related to each other .",
    "of course , if the mass matrices are symmetric , as has almost always been assumed , the left - handed and right - handed mixings are the same , and hence @xmath32 is directly related to @xmath31 . the most natural interpretation , then , of the experimental discovery that @xmath61 is that the mass matrices are highly asymmetric .",
    "this is the essential point first made in @xcite .",
    "not only does a highly asymmetric , or , as we will call it ,  lopsided , \" form of the mass matrices explain the difference between the size of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but it also explains the fact , noted above , that @xmath31 is larger than the fritzsch value and @xmath32 is smaller than the fritzsch value by about the same factor .",
    "the point is that the product of the two off - diagonal elements , @xmath60 and @xmath51 , is controlled by the fermion mass ratio . as is evident from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath62 .",
    "that means that the fritzsch prediction for the mixing of @xmath49 and @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 , goes approximately as @xmath65 .",
    "that shows that the fritzsch prediction for the mixing angles is roughly the geometric mean between the true value of @xmath66 and the true value of @xmath32 @xmath67 . in other words , in our hypothesis of lopsided mass matrices ,",
    "the surprising largeness of @xmath31 and the surprising smallness of @xmath32 are two sides of the same coin .",
    "another important feature of this mechanism should be emphasized .",
    "almost all published explanations of the largeness of the @xmath7 mixing trace it to some special feature or form of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "perhaps this is due to the purely linguistic fact that we talk about  neutrino mixing angles \" .",
    "but they could just as well be called the  charged - lepton mixing angles \" .",
    "they are really the angles expressing the mismatch between the neutrino mass eigenstates and the charged lepton mass eigenstates , just as the ckm angles are the mismatch between the up and down quark eigenstates . in our mechanism",
    ", the large value of @xmath31 is traceable to a peculiarity of the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath42 , namely , having a large off - diagonal entry @xmath51 .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , having such a large entry helps to explain several other features of the quark and lepton mass spectrum .    to sum up",
    ", the mechanism for explaining large @xmath7 mixing proposed in @xcite has three salient features : ( 1 ) the largeness of this mixing is due to the charged lepton mass matrix , which is ( 2 ) highly asymmetric , and which is ( 3 ) related to the transpose of the down quark mass matrix by @xmath2 .    in the next section",
    "we will see how a model with precisely these features arises very naturally in @xmath0 from very different considerations .",
    "the model that we shall examine in this paper emerged originally from our attempt to construct a realistic model based on @xmath0 @xcite in which @xmath0 is broken to the standard model group , @xmath68 in the simplest possible way .",
    "we shall therefore start by explaining what we mean by minimal @xmath0 breaking .    since @xmath0 is a rank 5 group , it requires for its breakdown to @xmath69 at least two higgs fields .",
    "one higgs field is needed to break the rank of the group to 4 , but this generally leaves an unbroken @xmath2 .",
    "the second higgs field is needed to break @xmath2 down to @xmath69 .",
    "the two breakings can occur in either sequence depending upon which higgs field has the larger vev and effects the first breaking .",
    "whatever higgs field gives superlarge mass to the right - handed neutrinos , as required for the standard seesaw explanation of the lightness of the left - handed neutrinos , will also break @xmath0 down to @xmath2 , and thus the rank to 4 .",
    "there are two simple choices for this higgs field : either an antisymmetric five - index tensor @xmath70 or a spinor @xmath71 . in either case , one also expects a higgs field in the conjugate representation , @xmath72 or @xmath73 , to go along with it .",
    "a nice feature of the @xmath70 is that this tensorial representation leaves unbroken a @xmath74 subgroup of the center of @xmath0 that acts as an automatic matter parity , whereas if a spinor higgs is introduced , then matter parity is not automatic . on the other hand , to introduce @xmath75 is to introduce quite large representations that tend to make the unified gauge coupling go non - perturbative below the planck scale , and that may be hard to obtain from superstring theory . in any event , it would seem that the use of a spinor - antispinor pair , @xmath76 , is more economical .",
    "thus we assume that the rank of @xmath0 is broken at the unification scale and the right - handed neutrinos get mass from one such spinor - antispinor pair of higgs fields .    to break the group the rest of the way to @xmath69 requires the existence of higgs fields in the adjoint representation @xmath77 and/or in the symmetric two - index tensor representation @xmath78 .",
    "most published realistic @xmath0 models have several of both kinds of multiplets .",
    "however , it has been shown that it is possible to break @xmath0 to @xmath69 with only a _ single _",
    "adjoint higgs and no larger representations @xcite .",
    "this , then , is what we call the ",
    "minimal breaking scheme for @xmath0 \" : _ the breaking of @xmath0 to @xmath69 is accomplished by the expectation values of a set of higgs fields consisting of _ @xmath79 , _ with the model containing no multiplets larger than the single _ @xmath77 . there , of course , have to be other higgs fields to break the @xmath80 group of the electroweak interactions .",
    "this minimality assumption is restrictive enough that it is possible to say in which direction the expectation values of these fields point .",
    "this can be done by considering the problem of doublet - triplet splitting , whereby the colored partners of the weak - doublet higgs fields of the standard model become superheavy while the weak - scale masses of the doublets themselves are preserved . in @xmath0 the only known way of doing this in a technically natural manner is the dimopoulos - wilczek or ",
    "missing vev \" mechanism @xcite .",
    "the idea is that if an adjoint higgs field that has an expectation value proportional to the @xmath0 generator @xmath81 couples to higgs fields in the vector representation , it will make their color - triplet components heavy ( since they have @xmath82 ) while leaving their weak - doublet components massless ( since they have @xmath83 ) .",
    "the needed coupling is simply of the form @xmath84 .",
    "of course , the expectation value of the adjoint , by virtue of the definition of the adjoint representation , is necessarily a linear combination of generators of the group .",
    "@xmath81 is one of the @xmath0 generators that is picked out by simple forms of the higgs superpotential for the adjoint multiplet .",
    "it should be noted that there is another version of the missing vev mechanism that works in @xmath0 , in which the vev of the adjoint is proportional to the generator @xmath85 of the @xmath86 subgroup of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , that version is significantly more complicated .",
    "therefore , simplicity dictates the choice that    @xmath87    since the assumption of a minimal @xmath0 breaking scheme included the supposition that only _",
    "one _ adjoint exists in the model , no adjoint exists except the one that points in the @xmath81 direction .",
    "as we shall see , this puts an important limitation on the possibilities for constructing realistic mass matrices for the quarks and leptons .",
    "the assumption of a minimal @xmath0 breaking scheme thus acts as an important guide in searching for good models .",
    "the simplest possible terms that would give mass to quarks and leptons in @xmath0 would be @xmath88 , where the subscripts @xmath89 and @xmath90 are family indices .",
    "this would lead to four proportional dirac mass matrices for the up - quarks ( @xmath91 ) , down quarks ( @xmath43 ) , charged leptons ( @xmath42 ) , and neutrinos ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "in fact one would have @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , all these matrices would be symmetric , which is why one can write @xmath94 instead of @xmath50 as in minimal @xmath2 . some of the predictions that follow from these relations are good , notably the famous prediction @xmath95 , where the superscript zero stands for quantities evaluated at the unification scale @xmath96 .",
    "however , @xmath97 also predicts that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "empirically , one finds instead that @xmath100 and @xmath101 . these factors of three are called the georgi - jarlskog factors @xcite . the simplest possible @xmath0 yukawa terms also predict that all the ckm angles vanish , since @xmath102 . while not exactly true , this is at least a good zeroth order relation , since the ckm angles are all small compared to unity . by contrast , in @xmath2 the matrices @xmath43 and @xmath91 are not related by the unified symmetry and so the ckm angles are unconstrained . the smallness of the ckm angles can be regarded , therefore , as evidence for @xmath0 . on the other hand , the proportionality of @xmath43 and @xmath91 in @xmath0 also predicts that @xmath103 , which fails badly by over an order of magnitude .",
    "what one can conclude is that a way of going beyond the simplest possible @xmath0 yukawa scheme must be found which preserves some of its predictions while breaking others .",
    "one way to do this involves using larger representations to break the electroweak interactions .",
    "for instance , in the original georgi - jarlskog model , a @xmath104 multiplet of @xmath2 ( not to be confused with the adjoint of @xmath0 ) participates in breaking @xmath105 . in the context of @xmath0 , this @xmath104 is contained in a @xmath70 , which is inconsistent with our minimality assumptions .",
    "more economical is to assume that the higgs fields that break @xmath0 at the unification scale , i.e. , the @xmath106 , couple to quarks and leptons and thus introduce the effects of that @xmath0 breaking into the quark and lepton mass relations .",
    "this is the assumption we make .    to describe the third family",
    "it is simplest to assume the minimal yukawa term @xmath107 as pictured in fig .",
    "1(a ) . by itself",
    ", this would make all the mass matrices have the form    @xmath108    that would give the following predictions , all of which are at least good zeroth approximations to reality : @xmath95 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is a mass of a fermion of the @xmath112 family .",
    "note that these are just the  good \" @xmath0 predictions mentioned above .",
    "the second family presents more of a challenge .",
    "the main issue is how to get the georgi - jarlskog factor of 3 between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "breaking of @xmath2 must be involved , since the bad relation @xmath98 arises already at the @xmath2 level .",
    "the only field that breaks @xmath2 in the framework of minimal @xmath0 breaking is the adjoint , @xmath115 . since @xmath116 , and",
    "the @xmath81 of leptons is @xmath117 times that of quarks , this field has the possibility of giving the needed georgi - jarlskog factor .",
    "thus one must seek an effective yukawa term that involves the @xmath115 .",
    "the simplest such term @xcite , in the sense of the term of lowest dimension , is of the form @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , this term can arise in a simple way by the integration out of a @xmath119 family plus antifamily at the unification scale , as shown in fig .",
    "there are actually two ways to contract the @xmath0 indices of such a term : the product @xmath120 can be contracted symmetrically or antisymmetrically .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath121 , only the antisymmetric contraction contributes to the quark and lepton mass matrices .",
    "( the reason is simple .",
    "if the vev of the adjoint is proportional to a generator @xmath122 , then the symmetric / antisymmetric contractions give contributions to fermion masses that go as @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath81 of an antifermion is minus that of the fermion , the contribution cancels for the symmetric contraction . )",
    "thus , one need only consider the flavor - antisymmetric term , which means only @xmath124 and not @xmath125 , or @xmath126 .",
    "consequently , the only operator of interest is @xmath127 which , together with the operator @xmath107 , gives    @xmath128    the desired factor of 3 has been achieved between leptons and quarks , due to the generator @xmath81 to which the adjoint vev is proportional .",
    "one also can see that the @xmath60 entries are flavor antisymmetric for reasons already explained .",
    "as they stand , these forms of the matrices are inadequate to explain even the features of the second and third families of fermions .",
    "there are three inadequacies .",
    "( 1 ) the factor of 3 comes in squared between the mass of the leptons and quarks of the second family .",
    "the reason is that , for @xmath60 small due to the mass hierarchy between families , the second eigenvalue of @xmath42 is given by the seesaw formula @xmath129 , while the second eigenvalue of @xmath43 is given by @xmath130 .",
    "( 2 ) the matrices @xmath43 and @xmath91 are still exactly proportional .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the generator @xmath81 does not distinguish up and down quarks .",
    "therefore , the ckm angle @xmath32 still exactly vanishes .",
    "( 3 ) because @xmath43 and @xmath91 are exactly proportional , one still has the bad prediction @xmath103 .",
    "it is clear that the breaking of @xmath0 due to the adjoint can not cure all of these problems , since @xmath81 does not distinguish @xmath43 from @xmath91 .",
    "thus the breaking of @xmath0 done by @xmath131 must come into play . as we shall now show , a single simple operator exists , which involves one of these spinor higgs and cures at one stroke all three of the problems we have identified .    the lowest dimension effective yukawa operators that involve the spinor higgs fields are quartic in spinors .",
    "consider , therefore , operators of the form @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath133 is the spinor higgs field that breaks @xmath0 at @xmath96 down to @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath134 is a spinor higgs that has a weak - scale vev that breaks @xmath80 . in principle",
    ", these two spinors could be the same field .",
    "however , if they were , it would mean that they had to be contracted symmetrically by bose statistics , which in turn would mean that @xmath135 and @xmath136 would also have to be contracted symmetrically .",
    "a careful examination shows that the resulting flavor - symmetric contributions to the mass matrices do not lead to realistic forms , though it is possible to achieve realistic mass matrices by adding yet another yukawa operator , as in the interesting model of babu , pati , and wilczek @xcite",
    ". therefore @xmath137 must be a distinct field .",
    "as will be seen later , introducing this @xmath138 involves no loss of economy , since it allows a very elegant explanation of the largeness of the ratio @xmath139 without making @xmath140 large .",
    "there are still several operators of this type to be considered : the family indices can take the values @xmath141 , or @xmath142 , and there are three ways to contract the four spinors to make an @xmath0 singlet . here",
    "again , one must examine the various cases to see which gives the most realistic mass matrices . as it turns out ,",
    "there is one operator that is much superior to the others , in the sense that it much more cleanly and simply fits the data .",
    "it is of the form @xmath143 [ { \\bf 16}_3 { \\bf 16'}_h]$ ] , where @xmath144 $ ] means that the spinors inside are contracted into a @xmath47 .",
    "this can arise very simply by integrating out a @xmath47 of fermions , as shown in fig .",
    "let us write the resulting mass operator in @xmath2 language .",
    "denote by @xmath145 a @xmath146 multiplet of @xmath2 that is contained in a @xmath147 multiplet of @xmath0 .",
    "the vev of @xmath133 lies , of course , in the @xmath148 direction , while the vev of @xmath138 that breaks the weak interactions lies in the @xmath149 direction .",
    "therefore , the resulting mass term is of the form @xmath150 [ { \\bf 10}({\\bf 16}_3 ) \\overline{{\\bf 5 } }   ( { \\bf 16}'_h)]$ ] , which in @xmath2 terms gives effectively the operator @xmath151 .",
    "note that this has the same form as the @xmath2 operator discussed in the last section , which gave the @xmath51 entries in eq .",
    "the result , then , of including this operator @xcite is to make the mass matrices take the form :    @xmath152    the new term has given the entries we call @xmath51 .",
    "note that these lopsided entries appear only in @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "the reason is simply that the @xmath138 contains a @xmath44 of @xmath2 but no @xmath153 .",
    "it is easy to see that the new term with @xmath154 cures at once all three of the problems we identified with the forms given in eq .",
    "( 9 ) : ( 1 ) instead of @xmath129 and @xmath155 , one has approximately that @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "more exact expressions will be given later .",
    "thus the desired georgi - jarlskog factor of 1/3 is obtained , instead of 1/9 .",
    "the @xmath51 entry has dominated over one of the factors of @xmath158 and thus prevented the factor of 1/3 from coming in squared .",
    "\\(2 ) the @xmath51 entry comes into @xmath43 but not @xmath91 , and thus breaks the proportionality of the two matrices . as a result , @xmath32 no longer vanishes , but is given approximately by @xmath159 .",
    "note that this is of the same order in @xmath60 as @xmath160 , rather than @xmath64 as is the case with fritzsch forms , and accords much better with the actual experimental values .",
    "\\(3 ) the fact that @xmath51 breaks the proportionality of @xmath91 and @xmath43 also means that the bad relation @xmath103 is broken .",
    "specifically , @xmath161 is of order @xmath60 , while @xmath162 is still of order @xmath163 and therefore much smaller .",
    "this also accords well with the experimental numbers .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , if one uses @xmath32 and @xmath164 to fix the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath60 , one finds that @xmath165(1 gev ) is predicted to be in agreement with the experimentally determined value of @xmath166 gev .",
    "it should also be noted that the prediction @xmath95 is only very slightly affected by the addition of the @xmath51 term , both @xmath167 and @xmath168 being given to leading order in @xmath60 by @xmath169 .",
    "the economy of the above mass matrix forms is seen in the fact that five quantities ( @xmath32 , @xmath164 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 ) are successfully fit with only the two parameters @xmath51 and @xmath60 .",
    "no other published form succeeds in accurately reproducing the masses and mixing of the the heavier two families with so few parameters .",
    "the predictions and fits will be discussed in detail in section iv .",
    "we see that the matrices in eq .",
    "( 10 ) were arrived at by a process of reasoning that had nothing to do with the question of neutrino mass but rather with an attempt to get realistic masses and mixings for the quarks and charged leptons using as simple a higgs sector as possible in @xmath0 .",
    "but what has emerged is a structure with precisely the three critical features identified in the last section as giving a simple explanation of the large mixing of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in fact",
    ", a fit of @xmath32 and @xmath164 gives @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "consequently , as can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the angle @xmath175 .",
    "this is quite consistent with what is observed .",
    "we will look more carefully at these predictions later .    to summarize , with two parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath51 , four mass ratios and two mixing angles are satisfactorily accounted for , if we include @xmath31 .",
    "no greater economy could be hoped for in explaining the spectrum of the heavy two families . moreover , as we shall see in the next section , the forms in eq .",
    "( 10 ) can be extended to include the first family with equal economy : the introduction of two new parameters ( one of which is complex ) will nicely account for seven quantities pertaining to the first family .    before explaining how the model is extended to the first family we will expand on a couple of points made earlier .",
    "first , we said that the introduction of the @xmath138 allows a simple explanation @xcite of why @xmath176 that does not require a @xmath177 .",
    "the point is that the higgs doublet of the mssm that is often called @xmath178 is purely contained in the @xmath179 that couples to @xmath180 and gives rise to the  1 \" entry in the mass matrices of eq .",
    "however , the higgs doublet of the mssm that is called @xmath181 does not come purely from @xmath179 .",
    "rather it is a mixture of doublets in @xmath179 and @xmath138 , since they both contain @xmath44 s of @xmath2 .",
    "thus we may write    @xmath182    where @xmath183 is some mixing angle that depends on the parameters of the higgs sector . since the 33 elements of the mass matrices all arise purely from the coupling of the @xmath179 , the parameters we called @xmath184 and @xmath185 in eq . (",
    "10 ) are given by    @xmath186    leading to the ratio @xmath187 , where @xmath140 is defined to be the ratio of the higgs vev @xmath188 giving mass to the top quark to the higgs vev @xmath189 giving mass to the bottom quark .",
    "hence    @xmath190    the point is simply that the large ratio of the top to bottom masses could be the result of @xmath191 being small rather than @xmath140 being large .",
    "in fact , since we do not know anything _ a priori _ about the angle @xmath183 , we can not say whether @xmath192 is large or small .",
    "it should be noted that if one assumes that @xmath181 lies mostly in the @xmath138 ( so that @xmath193 ) , it would explain why the parameter @xmath51 is large since it comes from a coupling to @xmath138 , and also explain why @xmath192 might be small .",
    "a second point we wish to underline here has to do with the reasonableness of asymmetric mass matrices .",
    "in many models it is assumed that all the mass matrices are symmetric .",
    "however , this is not something that is called for by the group theory of grand unification .",
    "it is true that with the minimal yukawa terms @xmath2 gives a symmetric @xmath91 .",
    "but even with minimal yukawa terms @xmath2 does not predict any symmetry of the @xmath43 and @xmath42 matrices . and in @xmath0 , as we have seen , once one introduces the effects of @xmath0 breaking into the yukawa sector , as one virtually must , one easily obtains effective yukawa terms that are asymmetric .",
    "1(c ) shows that very simple diagrams can give terms that are lopsided , in the sense that they contribute only above or below the diagonal . from the point of view of the fundamental grand unified theory ,",
    "then , lopsided terms are as natural as symmetric ones .",
    "the preference for symmetric terms has been the result not of examining what kinds of terms are obtained in a simple way in unification , but rather from the desire to reduce the number of parameters at the level of mass matrices with the aim of making models which are highly predictive . however , putting oneself in the straightjacket of symmetric matrices makes it hard to get a good fit to all the quark and lepton masses and mixings .",
    "it turns out , as we have seen , and will see further below , that allowing asymmetric matrices makes possible a model which gives both a very good fit to the data and is actually much more predictive than most models which assume symmetric matrices .",
    "in arriving at the form of the mass matrices for the heavy two families we were limited in the choices that were possible by the assumption we made about the simplicity of the @xmath0-breaking sector . in extending to the first family",
    "we are not quite so limited . nevertheless , the number of simple possibilities is not very large .",
    "there are several discrete choices : should the contributions to the first row and column of the mass matrices be flavor symmetric like the 1 s in eq .",
    "10 , antisymmetric like the @xmath60 s , or lopsided like the @xmath51 s ?",
    "should they contribute to all the matrices equally like the 1 s , to all the matrices but with non - trivial clebsch factors like the @xmath60 s or only to @xmath43 and @xmath42 like the @xmath51 s ?",
    "it is fairly easy to run through the various cases and see what kinds of relations among masses and mixings result .",
    "as it turns out , one of the simplest possibilities gives a remarkably good fit to the data .",
    "this uniquely simple choice @xcite is the following :    @xmath194    we have already mentioned that fits give @xmath195 and @xmath174 . the new parameters @xmath196 and @xmath197 both have magnitude of about @xmath198 .",
    "the parameter @xmath199 is by far the smallest , being about @xmath200 .",
    "the only role that @xmath199 plays in the sector of quarks and charged leptons is in giving the up quark a mass , for it makes negligible contributions to the down quark and electron masses as determined from @xmath43 and @xmath42 , respectively . in fig .",
    "2(a ) we have illustrated a higher - order diagram that can contribute to the parameter @xmath199 . since it is not excluded that the up quark is exactly massless , it is possible to set @xmath199 to zero . in any event , one can see that @xmath201 , which is by orders of magnitude smaller than any other interfamily ratio of masses in the standard model .",
    "it will , however , be of some significance for neutrino masses .",
    "if @xmath199 vanishes , this model gives only the small - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "but even if @xmath199 is as small as @xmath200 , it allows either the small - angle msw solution or bimaximal neutrino mixing to arise in a simple way .    turning to the parameters @xmath196 and @xmath197",
    ", we see that they appear symmetrically and only in @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "such terms are easily obtained in @xmath0 from simple diagrams such as that shown in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) .",
    "the effective operators arising from these diagrams are of the form @xmath202[{\\bf 16}_h { \\bf 16}'_h]$ ] with @xmath203 , where again the spinors in brackets are contracted symmetrically into a @xmath47 of @xmath0 which is integrated out . note , however , that the symmetric contributions @xmath196 and @xmath197 from the two higgs contraction @xmath204 $ ] contributes only to @xmath43 and @xmath42 by virtue of their @xmath2 structure .",
    "contrast these effective operators for @xmath203 with that occurring previously for the term @xmath51 arising from the diagram shown in fig .",
    "the three new parameters we have introduced are , as we shall see , sufficient to account for everything about the first family . before proceeding , however",
    ", we must be careful about complex phases .",
    "it is easy to show that if we allow all parameters of the model to be complex all but two phase angles can be rotated away from the mass matrices @xmath91 , @xmath43 , @xmath42 and @xmath92 , provided we now neglect the negligible @xmath199 contributions to @xmath43 and @xmath42 . we will call these physical phases @xmath205 and @xmath206 which appear as follows ,    @xmath207    where in these matrices and henceforth @xmath60 , @xmath51 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath199 denote the magnitudes of these parameters and the phases are written explicitly .",
    "the phase @xmath205 only comes into the fits of masses at higher order in the small quantity @xmath208 .",
    "numerically , its effect is only a few percent ; moreover , the fits ( especially to @xmath165 ) prefer a value near zero .",
    "therefore , we can ignore @xmath205 and will do so from now on . that leaves only the phase @xmath206 .",
    "its only significant effect , but a very important one , is to give the cp - violating phase angle @xmath209 .    instead of using the parameters @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath210",
    ", it will be somewhat more convenient to use the parameters @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 , which are defined in terms of them as follows :    @xmath214    and    @xmath215    the significance of these parameters is that they are essentially the left - handed and right - handed cabbibo angles .",

    "now we will consider what happens under what is presumably the more realistic assumption that @xmath332 .",

    "one possibility is that @xmath219 has a form in which its 12 , 21 , 13 , and 31 elements all vanish or are negligibly small .",
    "if such is the case , then the previous analysis applies , and the mixing of @xmath255 is due entirely to the matrix @xmath42 .",
    "the only effect of the parameter @xmath199 in the lepton sector is then to give @xmath334 a mass of about @xmath335 ev .",
    "the second possibility is that @xmath219 does have significant 12 , 21 and/or 13 , 31 elements .",
    "if this is the case then a strikingly different situation can arise @xcite , namely ",
    "bimaximal \" mixing @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the mass matrix of light neutrinos resulting from this form is    @xmath338    one sees that the 2 - 3 block has vanishing determinant , so that a rotation in the 2 - 3 plane by an angle @xmath339 brings @xmath224 to the form    @xmath340    this can be put in a more transparent form by a rotation in the 1 - 3 plane by an angle @xmath341 .",
    "this angle is less than or of order @xmath342 and thus negligible , practically speaking , so    @xmath343    it is clear that the 11 element , being higher order in @xmath199 , is likely to be much smaller than the 12 and 21 elements .",
    "the condition for this to be the case is that @xmath344 .",
    "if this very weak condition is satisfied , then the form of the matrix manifestly corresponds to the situation in which the @xmath255 and @xmath5 together form a pseudo - dirac pair .",
    "that in turn would mean that the mixing of these two neutrinos is very close to maximal .",
    "one sees from eq .",

    "the reason for this is that in this scheme the smallness of @xmath353 is due to the extreme smallness of the parameter @xmath199 , which is equal to the ratio @xmath354 .",
    "it is easy to see from what has already been said that the matrix @xmath283 needed to diagonalize @xmath284 is of the form    @xmath355    where we have neglected the tiny rotation @xmath356 .",
    "the matrix @xmath281 is already given in eq .",

    "however , @xmath262 becomes @xmath359 instead of the value given in eq .",
    "( 20 ) .",
    "the interesting lesson is that  bimaximal mixing \" is easy to achieve if the large mixing of @xmath5 and @xmath6 comes from the charged lepton sector , i.e. , from diagonalizing @xmath42 , while the large mixing of @xmath255 comes from diagonalizing @xmath224 .",

    "otherwise , this case is quite similar to that of eq .",

    "the authors of @xcite found that the higgs superpotential required to solve the doublet - triplet splitting problem could be neatly obtained from their list of higgs fields by introducing a global family symmetry group of the type @xmath370 , which can arise in a natural fashion from string theory . with this in mind",

    "it is then possible to write down explicitly the full higgs superpotential from the higgs @xmath0 and family assignments , where we have written it as the sum of five terms :    @xmath387          w_a & = & tr a^4/m + m_a tr a^2\\\\[0.1 in ]          w_{ca } & = & x(\\overline{c}c)^2/m^2_c + f(x )",

    "( 41 ) in order to solve the doublet - triplet splitting problem .",
    "turning now to the parameters @xmath196 and @xmath197 , we note that the near equality of their magnitudes leads to the ratio @xmath510 . moreover ,",
    "if we assume @xmath511 , we obtain the estimate @xmath512 with the numbers obtained earlier , whereas the actual value needed is @xmath513 .",
    "thus we have found that not only are the desired forms of the dirac ( and majorana ) matrices generated by the model of this section , but that the numerical values required for the matrix parameters are also quite reasonable .",
    "both the largeness of the atmospheric neutrino mixing @xmath31 and the smallness of the quark mixing @xmath32 can be elegantly accounted for by the idea that the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath42 is highly asymmetric or  lopsided \" and that the down - quark mass matrix @xmath43 is related to the transpose of @xmath42 by an @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "this idea was discovered independently by several groups and has since been used in numerous models of fermion masses .",
    "remarkably , exactly such mass matrices emerged in our work from quite other considerations than neutrino masses and mixings , specifically from an attempt to construct the simplest possible realistic @xmath0 model .",
    "advances have been made in recent years in simplifying the higgs structure of susy @xmath0 models . if one assumes the minimal set of higgs fields that can break @xmath0 down to the standard model group , the possibilities for yukawa terms for the quarks and leptons become significantly restricted .",
    "it turns out that there is what seems to be a uniquely simple set of @xmath0 yukawa terms that gives realistic masses and mixings .",
    "this set consists of only six effective yukawa terms ( five if @xmath514 ) which satisfactorily fits all nine masses of the quarks and charged leptons as well as the four ckm parameters .",
    "in addition , large @xmath7 mixing emerges automatically .",
    "moreover , in this uniquely simple model , the simplest possibilities for the majorana mass matrix @xmath219 of the right - handed neutrinos lead either to small angle msw values for the solar neutrino mixing or to vacuum oscillation values . in this paper",
    "we have studied in detail the consequences of different forms of @xmath219 for the neutrino mixing angles and mass ratios .    in the published literature",
    "no more predictive and economical a model for quark and lepton masses than the one discussed here exists that is also consistent with present knowledge .",
    "it is striking that in this model a single term and a single parameter ( which we call @xmath51 ) accounts for no less than four puzzling aspects of the light fermion spectrum : the largeness of @xmath31 , the smallness of @xmath32 , the smallness of @xmath171 compared to @xmath170 , and the georgi - jarlskog factor of three between @xmath515 and @xmath463 at the gut scale .",
    "it should be emphasized that , while many satisfactory neutrino mixing ideas and also many interesting ideas for explaining the pattern of quark and charged lepton masses have been proposed , very few models exist which not only give a satisfactory account of neutrino phenomenology but are at the same time highly predictive .",
    "we have shown that the model defined by the existence of these five ( or six ) effective yukawa terms can be realized in a complete and specific renormalizable susy @xmath0 model that is technically natural . we have presented the details of such a model , including all the higgs and quark and lepton superfields , the abelian flavor symmetries , and the transformation properties of the fields under these symmetries .",
    "finally , we have done a quantitative comparison of the predictions of the model to experiment .    in the future",
    "this model will be rigorously testable in several ways .",
    "the most important are ( 1 ) a relation between the real and imaginary parts of @xmath246 including a precise test of the angles of the unitarity triangle ; ( 2 ) a prediction for @xmath262 , which in the small angle msw case gives a sharp relation between the solar and atmospheric angles ; and ( 3 ) a definite prediction for @xmath223 .",
