    "in subsystem density - functional theory @xcite ( subsystem dft ) , the total electronic density of a molecular system is partitioned into subsystem contributions : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total number of subsystems .",
    "this is an appealing strategy , as it invokes a kind of `` divide and conquer '' principle which makes the electronic problem more manageable by partitioning it into several coupled sub - problems .",
    "this strategy is general , and can be formulated in such a way as to involve no approximations @xcite . in practice , this divide and conquer approach is more easily implemented if the electron system is composed of weakly interacting subsystems @xcite . in this limiting case , the total electron density in is already well approximated by using the electron densities of isolated subsystems ( i.e.  the molecular fragments composing the full system ) .",
    "subsystem dft is designed ( see section 2 ) to reproduce kohn  sham dft @xcite ( ks - dft ) , and thus is formally exact @xcite . because of this , subsystem dft inherits all the strengths and weaknesses of ks - dft , e.g.   the fact that the exact exchange  correlation ( xc ) functional , @xmath4 $ ] , is unknown . as a consequence , practical implementations of subsystem and ks - dft involve employing xc functional approximants .",
    "the most common class of approximants rely on local and semilocal forms of the functional , i.e.  it depends on the electron density and possibly also on its gradient at a point @xmath5 in space . due to their character , these semilocal approximations are unable to account for interactions that are non - local in nature , such as dispersion interactions @xcite and generally all long  ranged interactions originating from the correlated part of the energy functional .",
    "several solutions have been proposed to address this deficiency of local and semilocal xc functionals  @xcite .",
    "one avenue is the design of fully non - local functionals , as proposed by dion _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and by vydrov and van voorhis  @xcite .",
    "a very popular and efficient alternative has been an additive pairwise correction that uses the so - called @xmath6 coefficients @xcite .",
    "this type of correction is inspired by the casimir - polder formula , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance between fragment @xmath9 and @xmath10 in a molecular system .",
    "appropriate decompositions of the molecular system are used to yield pairwise corrections @xcite .    a better description of dispersion interactions is given by the generalized casimir - polder ( gcp ) formula @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electronic frequency dependent linear - response functions of the two isolated fragments . here",
    ", the fragment s electron densities are allowed to overlap and the restriction to large interfragment distance is also lifted .",
    "the gcp formula is derived to account for dispersion interactions to second order in perturbation theory , where the perturbation is the coulomb interaction between the fragments .",
    "a formally exact framework to obtain the full correlation energy ( as opposed to only the dispersion part ) is the adiabatic ",
    "connection fluctuation - dissipation theorem applied to dft ( acfdt - dft ) @xcite which relates the total correlation energy to the frequency dependent linear - response functions ( response functions , hereafter ) .",
    "since response functions can be efficiently calculated using semilocal dft @xcite , acfdt - dft is a very appealing way to introduce dispersion interactions , and generally all interactions arising from the correlated part of the energy .",
    "the simplest and most used method based on the acfdt is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite and its extensions  @xcite .",
    "rpa is parameter free , and was shown to be an order of magnitude more accurate than semi - local dft for mid- and long - range correlation  @xcite and of comparable accuracy as dispersion - corrected functionals , such as b3lyp - d3 , or highly parameterized functionals , such as m06 - 2x @xcite . for short - range correlation",
    ", rpa does not improve over semi - local dft , thus range - separated schemes were proposed which combine a short - range dft description of the system with a long - range rpa description .",
    "one advantage of these methods is a much faster convergence with basis set size at the cost of having to include a parameter in the formalism @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind this work is to devise a theory that exploits the fragment picture provided by subsystem dft and borrows ideas from acfdt - dft to obtain the ( theoretically exact ) correlation energy of interaction between fragments .",
    "this has , so far , not been attempted for overlapping electronic fragment densities ( for non - overlapping densities see ref .  ) . as we exploit the frozen density embedding ( fde ) formulation of subsystem dft , we call the resulting theory fde - vdw",
    ".    fde - vdw has several appealing properties : ( 1 ) full correlation energies are recovered , ( 2 ) the theory is formally exact and independent of the definition of the fragments ( or subsystems ) , ( 3 ) the long - range correlation energy is rigorously incorporated in the subsystem dft energy functional without resorting to an ad - hoc function that switches between the short and the long range .",
    "two recent publications provide a major motivation for this work .",
    "first , visscher and coworkers @xcite , demonstrated that the fde coupled with semiempirical dispersion corrections yields accurate interaction energies .",
    "second , chaasiski and coworkers @xcite , used a projector - based partitioning of hf and ks - dft wavefunctions into fragment wavefunctions to define an inter - fragment dispersion correction calculated with the gcp formula which yielded excellent interaction energies . in both of the mentioned publications as well as in this work , the common double - counting of van der waals interactions occurring when correcting the ks - dft interaction energies",
    "is completely bypassed and the resulting theories are more balanced .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 recalls some basic ideas of subsystem dft and its time - dependent extension .",
    "section 3 develops the fde - vdw theory by applying acfdt - dft to subsystem dft .",
    "section 4 gives an outline of possible approximations for practical calculations .",
    "section 5 presents details of the fde - vdw implementation .",
    "section 6 displays pilot calculations carried out with one of the approximations proposed in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 7 delineates conclusions and future directions for the presented formalism .",
    "the density partitioning in is in principle arbitrary .",
    "one can use chemical intuition to identify subsystems ( using for example a real - space partitioning ) , or any other criterion . unlike the density , the energy functional is not additive , and an exact form of it involves non - additive corrections that arise at the kinetic - energy and xc energy level as well as a hartree term describing the electrostatic interaction between subsystems , @xmath14 = \\sumi e[\\rhoi ] + j^{\\rm nadd}[\\{\\rhoi\\}]+ t^{\\rm nadd}_s [ \\{\\rhoi\\}]+e^{\\rm nadd}_{xc } [ \\{\\rhoi\\}],\\ ] ] where @xmath15=t_s[\\rhoi]+j[\\rhoi]+e_{xc}[\\rhoi]+v_{\\rm ext}[\\rhoi]$ ] , and in @xmath16 we have grouped the nuclear attraction term . a computationally attractive way to find subsystem densities @xcite is the frozen density embedding theory ( fde ) . in fde",
    "the energy functional of all the subsystem densities is minimized in w.r.t .",
    "only one subsystem density while keeping all the others frozen .",
    "this procedure can be repeated until self - consistency @xcite .",
    "freezing all densities but one during the minimization , is equivalent to using partial functional derivatives in the working ks equations and with that , mixed derivatives such as @xmath17}{\\delta\\rhoi}$ ] are always set to zero in fde .    the aim of fde is to represent the subsystems as a set of @xmath3 coupled kohn  sham systems .",
    "hence , the subsystem densities must be non - negative , must integrate to a preset number of electrons , i.e.  @xmath18 , and must be non - interacting @xmath19-representable . in practical fde calculations ,",
    "the subsystem densities are constructed from subsystem molecular orbitals which are expanded in terms of localized atomic orbitals , often centered on atoms belonging to only one molecular fragment in a system ( monomer basis set ) .",
    "thus , the subsystems are identified as non - covalently bound molecules .",
    "recently , however , embedding schemes based on optimized effective potential @xcite , projection operators @xcite , and fitted functionals @xcite , are paving the way for the correct description of covalent bonds ( high density overlap ) by fde .    self - consistent solution of a set of coupled ks - like equations ( also called ks equations with constrained electron density @xcite ) yields the set of subsystem ks orbitals @xmath20 \\phi^i_k(\\br ) = \\varepsilon^i_k   \\phi^i_k(\\br),\\mathrm{~with~}i=1,\\ldots , n_s\\ ] ] with the effective subsystem potential given by @xmath21 in the fde formulation of subsystem dft @xcite , the potential above , @xmath22 , is called embedding potential and is given by @xmath23 + \\\\ & + \\frac{\\delta t_s[\\rho]}{\\delta\\rhor}-\\frac{\\delta t_s[\\rhoi]}{\\delta\\rhoir}+\\frac{\\delta e_{\\rm xc}[\\rho]}{\\delta\\rhor}-\\frac{\\delta e_{\\rm xc}[\\rhoi]}{\\delta\\rhoir}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of closed - shell subsystems , the density of the supersystem is thus found using and as @xmath24    the time - dependent extension of subsystem dft @xcite is based on the runge - gross theorem @xcite which was recently proved also for subsystem dft by wasserman",
    "recently , linear - response subsystem td - dft was formulated in terms of subsystem response functions by one of us @xcite .",

    "the interacting response is evaluated at coupling strength @xmath41 and the adiabatic connection formula is used @xcite .",
    "the central problem is finding analytical and/or computationally appealing ways to evaluate .",
    "as the response functions explicitly depend on both occupied and virtual orbitals , for rpa and td - dft alike , a formal @xmath42 scaling with system size arises in their computation . for realistic systems",
    "this leads to a large computational expense and it is usually handled employing numerical techniques based on fitting of the response functions or the entire correlation energy expression @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of this work is that the computation of for the supersystem is completely avoided .",
    "we elaborate on this crucial aspect in the next section .",
    "we define the short range , intra - subsystem correlation energy as the correlation energy derived with with the pair density including only the response functions calculated in the uncoupled formalism of .",
    "this definition is inspired by the idea that when the subsystems are separated by an infinitely large distance , we have @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the response function of the isolated subsystem ) . in this asymptotic case , the short range correlation energy _ depends only on the degrees of freedom of a single subsystem _ , and the correlated part of the interaction between subsystems vanishes .",
    "according to our definition , the additive ( or short range ) part of the correlated pair density , @xmath45 , to be used in depends on the difference of response functions @xmath46 where we have used the approximation @xmath47 , which was discussed previously @xcite . to obtain the above uncoupled subsystem response function one needs to use and evaluate the interaction kernel @xmath48 at coupling strength @xmath41 , @xmath49 even though the additive correlation energy can theoretically be calculated with this formulation , it is not computationally advantageous @xcite and poses problems related to a singular @xmath50 as @xmath51 due to the ( semi ) locality of commonly adopted xc functionals @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will make the assumption that the additive ( or short - range ) correlation is well captured by semilocal xc density functional approximants .",
    "thus , the remainder of this work focuses on the inter - subsystem correlation energy , by finding an appropriate expression for the long range ( or non - subsystem - additive ) part of the correlated pair density , @xmath52 .      the subsystem dft density functional in",
    "is comprised of subsystem - additive and non - additive terms .",
    "specifically , the non - additive xc functional can be further split into exchange and correlation contributions , @xmath53 .",

    "it is , therefore , important to develop simplified expressions to compute the non - additive correlation energy .",

    "the needed equations to evaluate van der waals interactions arising between overlapping electron densities are now available .",
    "this has been an outstanding issue in this field , as a dft theory for van der waals interactions between two distinct electron densities has been available only in the non - overlapping case @xcite .    a recent energy decomposition analysis of subsystem dft calculations @xcite has shown that the inclusion of empirical van der waals terms in the interaction energy has the effect of improving the binding energies calculated with gga functionals . in line with those findings ,",
    "we show that the fde binding energies are dramatically improved if the non - additive correlation energy functional is made non - local in character and is evaluated with the fluctuation  dissipation theorem .",
    "preliminary results are promising and lead us to expect that fde - vdw can deliver good binding energies across three binding regimes : dispersion , dipole , and mixed dispersion - dipole .",
    "a very appealing property of fde - vdw is its potential for systematic improvement .",
    "for example , by including a numerical integration over the coupling strength parameter , @xmath41 , which would fold in non - local interaction effects beyond rpa .",
    "another interesting improvement is to use the second term in the perturbative expansion in . in this way , three - body terms would be included in the overall non - additive correlation .",
    "there are two clear weak points in the current implementation of the theory .",
    "first , the computational scaling for evaluating the non - additive correlation is prohibitive and it is typical of a correlated wavefunction method .",
    "in addition , the exact diagonalization of the casida equations needed for the evaluation of the subsystem response function is only possible for small systems .",
    "larger systems , such as uracil , indol and pyrazine , incur into linear dependencies of the @xmath118 occupied - virtual product space that prevents a numerically stable diagonalization .",
    "the second weak point is that , in subsystem dft , kinetic energy functionals are needed ( at the non - additive level ) for allowing a proper description of overlapping electron densities .",
    "the available kinetic energy functionals are mostly formulated at the gga level @xcite which are known to describe well only certain types of weak interactions and not others @xcite ( although gga xc functionals had been used in the referred studies ) .",
    "thus , the present theory will need to be accompanied in the future with more accurate kinetic energy density functionals , and more computationally amenable procedures for evaluating the response functions and the associated non - additive correlation energy .",
    "efforts to address both points are ongoing in our group and are based on the formulation of non - local kinetic energy functionals to address the former issue and on a density fitting approach to address the latter which will be inspired by the techniques developed by szalewicz and coworkers @xcite .",

    "in this section , we will show that the integrand of after all integrals are carried out with the exception of the one over the coupling strength , @xmath41 , has positive and approximately monotonically decreasing derivative .",
    "thus , if the response functions are chosen at a fixed value of @xmath41 , a good choice is @xmath120 .",

    "let us define @xmath121 as the value of the integrand in the definition of @xmath122 in when the imaginary frequency and the spatial integrations are carried out .",

    "recalling , and also that the evaluation of the integral in with the ks response functions ( @xmath128 ) yields much larger correlation energies than with correlated response functions @xcite , we find the following approximate inequality @xmath129 because the integrand of at zero coupling strength is exactly zero , the trend of @xmath121 can be inferred .",
    "namely , @xmath121 always lies above the linear extrapolation line , see figure [ appfig ] . for comparison ,",
