    "decoration @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite and stm @xcite clearly demonstrated the abrikosov flux line lattice in low and high @xmath0 type ii superconductors .",
    "there are however important differences between the two classes of materials .",
    "ginzburg parameter @xmath1 characterizing importance of thermal fluctuations is much larger in high @xmath2 superconductors than in the low temperature ones .",
    "moreover in the presence of magnetic field the importance of fluctuations in high @xmath0 superconductors is further enhanced .",
    "the lattice melts and becomes vortex liquid over large portions of the phase diagram @xcite . in  strongly fluctuating  superconductors , even far below the melting line , corrections to various physical quantities like magnetization or specific heat are not negligible .",
    "the vortex lattice becomes distorted .",
    "it is quite straightforward to systematically account for the fluctuations effect on magnetization , specific heat or conductivity perturbatively above the mean field transition line using ginzburg - landau ( gl )  description @xcite .",
    "however in the interesting region below this line it turned out to be extremely difficult to develop a quantitative theory .",
    "a direct approach to the low temperature fluctuations physics is to start from the mean field solution and then take fluctuations around this inhomogeneous solution into account perturbatively .",
    "experimentally it is reasonable since , for example , specific heat at low temperatures is a smooth function and the fluctuations contribution is quite small .",
    "for some time this was in disagreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "eilenberger calculated spectrum of harmonic excitations of the triangular vortex lattice @xcite and noted that the gapless mode is softer than the usual goldstone mode expected as a result of spontaneous breaking of translational invariance .",
    "the inverse propagator for the  phase  excitations behaves as @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that this behavior is directly related to the nondispersive nature of the shear modulus @xmath4 and is in agreement with numerous experiments .",
    "the influence of this additional  softness  goes beyond enhancement of the contribution of fluctuations at leading order .",
    "it apparently leads to disastrous infrared divergencies at higher orders rendering the perturbation theory around the vortex state doubtful .",
    "one therefore tends to think that nonperturbative effects are so important that such a perturbation theory should be abandoned @xcite .",
    "however it was shown in @xcite that a closer look at the diagrams reveals that in fact one encounters actually only logarithmic divergencies .",
    "this makes the divergencies similar to so called  spurious  divergencies in the theory of critical phenomena with broken continuous symmetry and they exactly cancel at each order provided we are calculating a symmetric quantity .",
    "one can effectively use properly modified perturbation theory to quantitatively study various properties of the vortex liquid phase .",
    "magnetization calculated using this perturbative approach agrees very well with the direct monte carlo simulation of @xcite .",
    "the method was then extended beyond the lowest landau level ( lll ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the effect of fluctuations on the magnetic field distribution , structure function of the vortex lattice and compare with existing mc results .",
