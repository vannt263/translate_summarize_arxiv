    "the path integral formulation plays an important role in nonperturbative studies of quantum field theories due to the possibility of using monte carlo methods . the basic idea is to generate field configurations with a probability @xmath0 and to evaluate the path integral by taking a statistical average .",
    "it is not straightforward , however , to apply such an approach to cases with a complex action @xmath1 since one can no longer view @xmath0 as the probability distribution .",
    "this `` complex action problem '' occurs , for instance , in qcd at finite density or with a theta term , in chern - simons gauge theories , and in chiral gauge theories .",
    "it also appears in supersymmetric gauge theories and matrix models , which are relevant in nonperturbative studies of superstring theory .    the complex langevin method ( clm ) @xcite attempts to solve this problem by extending the idea of stochastic quantization @xcite for ordinary systems with a real action to the case with a complex action .",
    "this necessarily requires complexifying the real dynamical variables that appear in the original path integral .",
    "a stochastic process for the complexified variables is defined by the langevin equation with the complex action , and expectation values in the original path integral are calculated from an average of corresponding quantities over the stochastic process .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a pedagogical review on this method .",
    "one of the recent developments in this method is the clarification of a necessary condition for convergence to correct results @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a lot of freedom in defining the stochastic process that corresponds formally to the original path integral . by using this freedom",
    ", one can try to satisfy the conditions for convergence .",
    "the so - called gauge cooling @xcite is a new technique of this kind , which has made it possible to study finite density qcd in the high temperature ( deconfined ) phase @xcite . despite these developments ,",
    "there is still a puzzle concerning the treatment of logarithmic singularities in the action @xcite .",
    "for instance , the effective action for qcd involves the logarithm of a determinant , which represents the effects of dynamical quarks . at finite density ,",
    "the determinant @xmath2 becomes complex in general , which causes the complex action problem . in this case",
    ", the effective action has an ambiguity due to the branch cut of the logarithm ; the phase of the determinant can be defined only modulo @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , one may use the drift term @xmath4 in the complex langevin equation , which corresponds to regarding the @xmath5 term in the action as a multi - valued function .",
    "it has been found , however , that the clm with this prescription can give wrong results in a simplified model when the phase of the determinant rotates frequently during the stochastic process @xcite .",
    "the wrong results turn out to be close to ( but not equal to ) the results obtained for the phase - quenched model , in which the phase of the determinant is quenched .",
    "this problem has not shown up yet in recent qcd simulations at finite density @xcite .    here",
    "we provide new insights into this issue from the viewpoint of the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation .",
    "we start with simple examples and discuss more general cases towards the end .",
    "let us consider a simple example defined by the partition function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a real variable and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real parameters . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the weight @xmath12 is complex , and the idea of important sampling can not be applied to ( [ part-1var ] ) by regarding @xmath12 as the boltzmann weight . following the usual procedure in clm",
    ", we define the drift term @xmath13 and complexify the variable as @xmath14 .",
    "the action @xmath15 after the complexification has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath16 for @xmath11 , which causes the aforementioned ambiguity due to the branch cut . however , we emphasize that this is not an issue , in general , because all we need in formulating the clm , as we show below , is the single - valuedness of the drift term @xmath17 after the complexification and the single - valuedness of the complex weight @xmath12 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "these are satisfied in the present case even for a non - integer @xmath9 .",
    "the complex langevin equation corresponding to the partition function ( [ part-1var ] ) can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents a real gaussian noise satisfying @xmath20 .",
    "we define the probability distribution @xmath21 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the langevin time @xmath24 .",
    "its time evolution follows the fp - like equation @xmath25 the crucial point in the clm is that there exists a complex weight @xmath26 , which is related to the probability distribution @xmath21 through @xmath27 under certain conditions @xcite , where @xmath28 are observables that admit holomorphic extension to @xmath29 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath30 follows the usual fp equation @xmath31 which has a time - independent solution @xmath32 , with @xmath12 given in ( [ part-1var ] ) since it is annihilated by the operator in parenthesis in ( [ fp-1var ] ) .",
    "thus , the necessary and sufficient conditions for being able to calculate the expectation value of @xmath33 with respect to ( [ part-1var ] ) by the clm are :    1 .   the relation ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) between @xmath30 and @xmath34 holds .",
    "the solution @xmath26 of the fp equation ( [ fpeq - general ] ) asymptotes to @xmath12 as @xmath35 up to some constant factor .    as possible observables in the present example ( [ part-1var ] )",
    ", we consider @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a positive integer .",
    "assuming the ergodicity of the stochastic process , the right - hand side of ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) at @xmath38 can be evaluated by taking the time average of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is obtained by solving ( [ cle-1var ] ) .",
    "we find numerically that this method gives correct results only for sufficiently large @xmath41 for each @xmath9 . in what follows , we clarify the reason why it fails at small @xmath41 .",
    "first we have investigated numerically the eigenvalue spectrum of the `` fp hamiltonian '' @xmath42 defined by ( [ fp-1var ] ) , assuming that the complex weight @xmath43 falls off rapidly as @xmath44 .    as is clear from what we wrote above , we have an eigenfunction @xmath45 with zero eigenvalue for arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath9 is a positive odd integer and @xmath46 , we have another zero mode @xmath47 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "negative eigenvalues appear in the small @xmath41 region .",
    "( note that , when @xmath46 , we have an eigenfunction @xmath49 , which corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath50 for any @xmath9 . )",
    "thus , we find that the desired solution @xmath32 is obtained in the long - time limit of the fp equation ( [ fpeq - general ] ) at arbitrary @xmath8 for @xmath51 and at sufficiently large @xmath41 for @xmath48 .    in the parameter region where we have negative modes ,",
    "the complex weight diverges as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the smallest eigenvalue and @xmath54 is the corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "clearly this behavior is incompatible with the relation ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) considering that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that the relation ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) between @xmath30 and @xmath34 must be broken _ at least _ in this region .    applying this kind of argument to a general multi - variable case , we find that the condition like ii ) in section [ sec : model - method ] is automatically satisfied if the condition like i ) holds , as far as the probability distribution @xmath34 asymptotes to a unique function .",
    "let us then consider what can go wrong with ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) . in the derivation of ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors use @xmath57 where @xmath58 is defined by solving @xmath59 with the initial condition @xmath60 .",
    "the symbol @xmath61 represents an operator satisfying @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , assuming that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are regular functions with sufficiently fast fall - off as @xmath66 . in order to prove ( [ p - condition ] ) , they consider @xcite @xmath67 for @xmath68 , which interpolates both sides of eq .",
    "( [ p - condition ] ) . taking the derivative with respect to @xmath69",
    ", they get @xmath70 naively , the two terms cancel through integrating by parts , which implies that @xmath71 is independent of @xmath69 and hence ( [ p - condition ] ) . in order to justify the partial integration , however , one should be able to neglect the boundary terms .",
    "this requires that @xmath21 decreases sufficiently fast as @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "in addition to this requirement , one also needs the holomorphy of the drift and of the observables to prove ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) .      in the present example , the fast fall - off of @xmath21 as @xmath66 is satisfied due to the @xmath72 term in ( [ cle-1var ] ) .",
    "however , we should be careful of the singularity at @xmath73 . in order for the boundary terms to be neglected , it is required that the limits @xmath74   \\ , \\label{boundary - terms1 }   \\\\ \\lim_{y\\rightarrow -\\alpha } \\big[(y+\\alpha ) \\ !",
    "\\frac { { \\cal o}(z;\\tau)}{| z + i\\alpha |^2 }   p(x , y;t-\\tau ) dx \\big ] \\label{boundary - terms2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] should exist for arbitrary @xmath24 and @xmath69 .",
    "note , in particular , that @xmath75 obtained by solving ( [ o - evolution ] ) is highly singular at @xmath76 since the operator @xmath77 appearing on the right - hand side of ( [ o - evolution ] ) involves the singularity .",
    "for instance , let us take the @xmath78th derivative of the above expressions with respect to @xmath69 at @xmath79 . using ( [ o - evolution ] ) , we obtain terms such as @xmath80    \\ , \\label{boundary - terms1-limit } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which diverges as @xmath81 for @xmath82 if @xmath21 is nonzero at @xmath73 . in order to describe the actual situation , let us define the radial distribution @xmath83 around the singular point @xmath73 . for small @xmath41 , we observe that @xmath84 at small @xmath85 as long as @xmath9 is not very large",
    ". in this case , ( [ boundary - terms1-limit ] ) still diverges for sufficiently large @xmath78 , and the relation ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) between @xmath30 and @xmath34 can be violated .",
    "indeed we find that the clm yields wrong results in such a parameter region .      in the partition function ( [ part-1var ] )",
    ", it is the prefactor @xmath86 that causes the complex action problem . in view of this",
    ", one might think that the clm fails when the phase of @xmath87 rotates frequently during the time evolution from ( [ cle-1var ] ) .",
    "we find that this is not necessarily the case .",
    "obtained by the clm ( [ cle-1var ] ) is plotted against @xmath8 for @xmath88 .",
    "the solid line represents the exact result obtained analytically by the gaussian integration .",
    ", height=226 ]     defined in ( [ def - f ] ) is plotted for @xmath88 with @xmath89 ( solid line ) and @xmath90 ( dashed line ) .",
    ", height=226 ]    in order to demonstrate this point , we present our results for large @xmath9 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the clm reproduces the exact results for @xmath91 at @xmath88 . from fig .  2",
    ", we find for @xmath90 that @xmath92 at @xmath93 , although we observe that the phase of @xmath94 rotates frequently during the stochastic process .",
    "we would also like to mention that the complex action problem is extremely severe at @xmath90 and @xmath88 . as a standard quantity that measures the severeness of the complex action problem ,",
    "let us consider @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the partition function of the phase - quenched model @xmath97 and the expectation value @xmath98 is taken with respect to it . in the present case , both @xmath99 and @xmath96 can be calculated analytically by performing the gaussian integration .",
    "we find that @xmath100 at @xmath90 and @xmath88 .",
    "one can imagine how hard it is to obtain correct results if one performs a monte carlo simulation of the phase - quenched model and applies the standard reweighting formula to obtain the expectation values with respect to the original partition function ( [ part-1var ] ) .",
    "thus , the advantage of the clm over the reweighting method can be appreciated even in this simple one - variable case .",
    "another interesting implication of our argument is that the possible failure of the clm is not specific to logarithmic singularities in the action .",
    "indeed we have found that the clm can fail for the weight @xmath101 with the action @xmath102 note that the action @xmath103 after complexification does _ not _ involve a logarithmic singularity , which means , in particular , that there is no issue of ambiguity associated with the branch cut . nevertheless , we find that the clm fails at @xmath104 for @xmath105 and at @xmath106 for @xmath107 . on the other hand , from the studies of the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath42 ,",
    "we find that @xmath108 is obtained in the long - time limit of the fp equation ( [ fpeq - general ] ) for arbitrary @xmath8 with @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the failure of the clm at small @xmath41 should be attributed to the violation of ( [ rho - p - rel ] ) due to the singularity in the drift term @xmath110 .",
    "this is also confirmed from the behavior of the radial distribution ( [ def - f ] ) .",
    "our argument applies also to the case with multiple variables . to make this clear ,",
    "let us consider a case with two variables given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are real variables .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is real , while @xmath9 is a positive integer .",
    "we have studied numerically the eigenvalue spectrum of the operator @xmath42 , assuming that the complex weight @xmath114 falls off rapidly as @xmath115 .",
    "first we obtain the desired zero mode @xmath116 for arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath46 , we have another zero mode @xmath117 for any @xmath9 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "negative modes appear at small @xmath41 .",
    "( note that , when @xmath46 , we have an eigenfunction @xmath118 , which corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath50 for any @xmath9 . )",
    "thus , we can make an argument analogous to the one - variable case ( [ part-1var ] ) .",
    "indeed we find for @xmath119 that the clm with complexified variables @xmath120 and @xmath121 gives wrong results at small @xmath41 .",
    "this can be understood from the behavior of the radial distribution for @xmath122 .",
    "let us discuss the implication of our argument to finite density qcd , which involves the complex fermion determinant @xmath123 in the partition function , where @xmath124 represents the dirac operator and @xmath125 is the quark mass .",
    "the determinant can be written as the product of the eigenvalues @xmath126 of @xmath127 .",
    "the drift term of the complex langevin equation involves @xmath128 , where @xmath129 represents the derivative with respect to the complexified gauge field .    according to our argument",
    ", the problem we discussed does not appear as long as the distribution of @xmath126 is practically zero at the origin , even if the phase of the fermion determinant rotates frequently during the stochastic process .",
    "( see our results for large @xmath9 in the one - variable case . )",
    "this is consistent with the results of recent qcd simulations at finite density , where the distribution of @xmath126 has the desired property due either to large quark mass @xcite or to high temperature @xcite . on the other hand , the eigenvalues of @xmath124 obtained in the clm",
    "are speculated to accumulate at the origin in the chiral limit ( corresponding to the @xmath130 limit ) when the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken @xcite . if true , the clm will have problems in that parameter regime unless some new idea is invoked .",
    "we have discussed the issue in the clm concerning the logarithmic singularities in the action .",
    "the standard drift term corresponds to regarding the logarithm in the action as a multi - valued function of the complexified variables .",
    "the clm with this drift term is known to give wrong results in some cases .",
    "theoretical understanding of this problem is important , for instance , in applying the method to finite density qcd in the low temperature ( confined ) phase with light quark mass .",
    "first we emphasized that the multi - valuedness of logarithmic terms in the action can not be considered the cause of the problem since one can formulate the method without referring to the action , as we have done in section [ sec : model - method ] .",
    "this is also indicated by the example in section [ sec : non - log ] .",
    "rather , the problem should be attributed to the possible breakdown of the key relation between @xmath30 and @xmath34 due to the singularities in the drift term of the complex langevin equation . in particular , we pointed out that the relation can be violated due to the boundary terms appearing from integrating by parts in proving ( [ p - condition ] ) , which diverges unless @xmath34 is practically zero around the singularities .",
    "this assertion was supported by simple examples .",
    "a more quantitative analysis will be reported in the forthcoming publication .",
    "the `` fp hamiltonian '' can have negative modes only if the key relation between @xmath30 and @xmath34 is violated .",
    "note , however , that the key relation can be violated even if the `` fp hamiltonian '' does not have negative modes .",
    "hence , the appearance of the negative modes should be regarded merely as an indicator of the violation of the key relation , the latter being the cause of the problem .",
