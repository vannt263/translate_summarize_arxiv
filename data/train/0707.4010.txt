    "the natural shape of an isolated self - gravitating fluid is axially symmetric .",
    "for this reason , exact axial symmetric solutions of einstein field equations are good candidates to model astrophysical bodies in general relativity . in the last decades",
    ", several exact solutions were studied as possible galactic models .",
    "static thin disk solutions were first studied by @xcite and @xcite , where they considered disks without radial pressure .",
    "disks with radial pressure and with radial tension had been considered by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "self - similar static disks were studied by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "moreover , solutions that involve superpositions of black holes with static disks were analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , relativistic counter - rotating thin disks as sources of the kerr type metrics were found by @xcite .",
    "counter - rotating models with radial pressure and dust disks without radial pressure were studied by @xcite , and @xcite , respectively ; while rotating disks with heat flow were studied by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , static thin disks as sources of known vacuum spacetimes from the chazy - curzon metric @xcite and zipoy - voorhees @xcite metric were obtained by @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite found an infinite number of new relativistic static solutions that correspond to the classical galactic disk potentials of kuzmin & toomre @xcite and mestel & kalnajs @xcite .",
    "stationary disk models including electric fields @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , and both electric and magnetic fields @xcite had been studied . in the last years , exact solutions for thin disks made with single and composite halos of matter @xcite , charged dust @xcite and charged perfect fluid @xcite were obtained . for a survey on relativistic gravitating disks ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the models constructed above were found using the metric to calculate its energy momentum - tensor , i.e. an inverse problem .",
    "several exact disk solutions were found using the direct method that consists in computing the metric for a given energy momentum tensor representing the disk @xcite . in a first approximation , the galaxies can be thought to be thin , what usually simplifies the analysis and provides very useful information .",
    "but , in order to model real physical galaxies the thickness of the disks must be considered .",
    "exact axially symmetric relativistic thick disks in different coordinate systems were studied by @xcite .",
    "also , different thick disks were obtained from the schwarzschild metric in different coordinates systems with the ",
    "displace , cut , fill , and reflect \" method @xcite .    the applicability of these disks models to any structure found in nature lays in its stability .",
    "the study of the stability , analytically or numerically , is vital to the acceptance of a particular model . also , the study of different types of perturbations , when applied to these models , might give an insight on the formation of bars , rings or different stellar patterns . moreover",
    ", a perturbation can cause the collapse of a stable object with the posterior appearance of a different kind of structure .",
    "an analytical treatment of the stability of disks in newtonian theory can be found in @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "in general , the stability of disks in general relativity is done in two ways .",
    "one way is to study the stability of the particle orbits along geodesics .",
    "this kind of study was made by @xcite transforming the rayleigh criterion of stability @xcite into a general relativistic formulation . using this criterion ,",
    "the stability of orbits around black holes surrounded by disks , rings and multipolar fields were analyzed @xcite .",
    "also , this criterion was employed by @xcite to study the stability of the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk , and thin disks of single and composite halos .",
    "the stability of circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes was studied by @xcite and @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the stability of circular orbits of the lemos - letelier solution @xcite for the superposition of a black hole and a flat ring was considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite analyzed the stability of several thin disks without radial pressure or tension studying their velocity curves and specific angular momentum .",
    "another way of studying the stability of disks is perturbing its energy momentum tensor .",
    "this way is more complete than the analysis of particle motions along geodesics , because we are taking into account the collective behavior of the particles .",
    "however , there are few studies in the literature performing this kind of perturbation .",
    "a general stability study of a relativistic fluid , with both bulk and dynamical viscosity , was done by @xcite .",
    "he considered the coefficients of the perturbed variables as constants , i.e. local perturbations .",
    "usually , this condition is too restrictive .",
    "stability analysis of thin disks from the schwarzschild metric , the chazy - curzon metric and zipoy - voorhees metric , perturbing their energy momentum tensor with a general first order perturbation , were made by @xcite , finding that the thin disks without radial pressure are not stable .",
    "moreover , stability analysis of the static isotropic schwarzschild thick disk as well as the general perturbation equations for thick disks were studied by @xcite .    in newtonian gravity ,",
    "models for globular clusters and spherical galaxies were developed by @xcite and @xcite . in the case of disk galaxies ,",
    "important thick disk models were obtained by miyamoto and nagai @xcite from the prior work of @xcite and @xcite about thin disks galaxies .",
    "miyamoto and nagai  thickened - up \" toomre s series of disk models and obtained pairs of three - dimensional potential and density functions .",
    "also , @xcite obtained a family of three - dimensional axisymmetric mass distribution from the higher order plummer models .",
    "the miyamoto - nagai potential shares many of the important properties of actual galaxies , especially the contour plots of the mass distribution which are qualitatively similar to the light distribution of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , two different extensions of the miyamoto - nagai potential appeared in the literature : a triaxial generalization @xcite which has as a particular case the original axially symmetric model , and a relativistic version @xcite which has as a newtonian limit the same original model .    in order to have a general relativistic physical model for galaxies , we must consider , first of all , the thickness of the disk and its stability under perturbations of the fluid quantities .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study numerically the stability of the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk under a general first order perturbation .",
    "the perturbation is done in the temporal , radial , axial and azimuthal components of the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor of the fluid . in the general thick disk case @xcite",
    ", the number of unknowns is larger than the number of equations .",
    "this opens the possibility of performing several types of combinations of the perturbed quantities . in this manuscript",
    "we search for perturbations in which a perturbation in a given direction of the pressure creates a perturbation in the same direction of the four velocity .",
    "the energy momentum perturbation considered in this manuscript is treated as  test matter \" , so it does not modified the background metric obtained from the solution of einstein equations .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the general perturbed conservation equations for the thick disk case . the energy momentum tensor is considered diagonal with all its elements different from zero . also ,",
    "in particular , we discuss the perturbations that will be considered in some detail in the next sections of this work . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we present the thick disk model whose stability is analyzed , i.e. the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk . the form of its energy density and pressures , as well as , the restrictions that the thermodynamic quantities must obey to satisfy the strong , weak and dominant energy conditions are shown .",
    "later , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we perform the perturbations to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk ; in particular we study its stability . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we summarize our results .",
    "the thick disk considered is a particular case of the general static - axially - symmetric metric    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of the variables ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "( our conventions are : @xmath5 , metric signature + 2 , partial and covariant derivatives with respect to the coordinate @xmath6 denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . )    in its rest frame , the energy momentum tensor of the fluid @xmath9 is diagonal with components ( -@xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 is the total energy density and ( @xmath12 ) are the radial , azimuthal and axial pressures or tensions , respectively .",
    "so , in this frame of reference , the energy momentum tensor can be written as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the four vectors of the orthonormal tetrad    @xmath18    which satisfy the orthonormal relations .",
    "note that with the above definitions , the timelike four velocity of the fluid is @xmath14 and the quantities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the spacelike principal directions of the fluid .",
    "furthermore , the energy momentum tensor satisfies einstein field equations , @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor and the coefficients of the perturbed conservation equations are functions of the coordinates ( @xmath4 ) only .",
    "let us consider a general perturbation @xmath20 of a quantity @xmath21 of the form    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the unperturbed quantity and @xmath24 is the perturbation .",

    "( [ t])-([z ] ) we assumed that the perturbed energy momentum tensor does not modify the background metric . also , we disregard terms of order greater or equal to @xmath36 . for details see @xcite .    besides the four equations furnished by the energy momentum conservation equations , @xmath37 , there is another important conservation equation , the equation of continuity ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the proper number density of particles .",
    "the proper number density of particles @xmath39 , and the total energy density @xmath11 are related through the relation ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the constant mean baryon mass and @xmath42 the internal energy density .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ varepsilon ] ) by @xmath14 , performing the covariant derivative ( @xmath8 ) and using eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) , we obtain that    @xmath43    now , from the relation @xmath44 and the energy momentum tensor ( [ tmunu ] ) , we obtain an expression for @xmath45 . substituting this last expression into eq .",
    "( [ rhovar ] ) we finally arrive to    @xmath46    which is a first order differential equation for @xmath42 . therefore , with @xmath42 given by ( [ pdevar ] ) the equation of continuity ( [ continuity ] ) is satisfied .",
    "for this reason , the continuity equation can be omitted in our stability analysis because , in principle , we can always find a solution for @xmath42 .",
    "hereafter , the contribution of @xmath47 and @xmath42 to the total energy density are taken into account in @xmath11 . in the case in which the internal energy density of the fluid is given ,",
    "the equation of continuity must be considered .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system can be obtained from observations or theoretically , e.g. from the fokker - planck equation , where we obtain the particle distribution function of the disk .",
    "solving the three dimensional fokker - planck equation is not an easy task , but some progress in newtonian gravity had been done @xcite .",
    "the four equations , ( [ t])-([z ] ) , contain seven independent unknowns , say @xmath48 .",
    "so , at this point , the number of unknowns are greater than the number of equations .",
    "this opens the possibility to perform different kind of perturbations . in this article",
    "we are interested in perturbations in which the velocity perturbation in a certain direction leads to a pressure perturbation in the same direction .",
    "for example , if we perturbed the axial component of the velocity , @xmath49 , then we must perturb @xmath50 . with the above criterion , and without imposing any extra conditions to the individual perturbations , only four perturbations combinations are allowed and will be considered in our thick disk model .",
    "furthermore , we perform the perturbation @xmath51 with the extra imposed condition @xmath52 . in this particular case , the system of equations reduces to a second order partial differential equation .",
    "a static general relativistic version of the miyamoto - nagai disk was constructed by @xcite by making a correspondence between the general isotropic line element in cylindrical coordinates and the miyamoto - nagai model @xcite .",
    "these general relativistic disks are obtained with ( [ metric ] ) and the specializations ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the mass of the disk , and ( @xmath56 ) are constants that control the shape of the density curves . with this metric ,",

    "[ sec2 ] to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk mentioned above and study its stability .",
    "before applying the different kinds of perturbations to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk we must do some considerations .",
    "note that the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk is infinite in the radial and axial directions .",
    "we want to study the stability of a finite disk .",
    "so , in order to achieve this requirement we need a cutoff in the radial coordinate . in eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , ( [ pr ] ) and ( [ pz ] ) , we see that the thermodynamic quantities decrease rapidly enough to define a cutoff in both coordinates .",
    "the radial cutoff @xmath66 and the axial cutoff @xmath67 are set by the following criterion : the energy density within the disk formed by the cutoff parameters has to be more than 90% of the infinite thick disk energy density .",
    "the above criterion , and the parameters used in the article , leads to a radial cutoff of @xmath68 units and an axial cutoff of @xmath69 units .",
    "the other 10% of the energy density that is distributed from outside the cutoff parameters to infinity can be treated , if necessary , as a perturbation in the outermost boundary condition .",

    "we set the perturbation @xmath73 to be @xmath85 10% of the unperturbed pressure @xmath77 ( [ pr ] ) . in the outer radius of the disk we set @xmath86 because we want our perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk and , in that way , to be in accordance with the applied linear perturbation .",
    "we say that our perturbations are valid if their values are lower , or of the same order of magnitude , than the 10% values of its unperturbed quantities .    in fig .",

    "we also performed stability analyses for the physical radial velocity perturbation @xmath98 and the physical azimuthal velocity perturbation @xmath99 .",
    "note that our four velocity @xmath14 ( [ tetrad ] ) has only components in the temporal part , so we do not have values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 to make comparisons with the perturbed values @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "for that reason we compared , in first approximation , the amplitude profiles of these perturbations with the value of the escape velocity in the newtonian limit .",
    "in the newtonian limit of general relativity , @xmath104 , we have the well known relation @xmath105 .",

    "we performed the same analysis for different values of the parameter @xmath109 , and we found that the perturbations show the same qualitative behavior .",
    "therefore , we can say that the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk shows some not - stable modes for very flat galaxies , e.g. ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "otherwise the disk is stable under perturbations of the form presented in this subsection .    nevertheless , if we treat the 10% of the energy density as a perturbation in the outermost radius of the disk by setting @xmath110 , where @xmath111 of @xmath112 , the qualitative behavior of the mode profiles is the same . in the case of flat galaxies ,",

    "therefore , the set of equations ( [ t])-([z ] ) reduces to a second order partial differential equation for the pressure perturbation @xmath129 , say    @xmath130    where ( @xmath131 ) are functions of ( @xmath132 ) , see appendix [ fmne ] .",
    "the partial differential equation ( [ pde2mne ] ) is solved numerically with four boundary conditions , at @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath84 and @xmath135 .",
    "they are different ways in which we can set the boundary conditions in order to simulate various kinds of pressure perturbations . here , we treat only the case when we have a pressure perturbation at @xmath84 and along the @xmath82 axis , i.e. some kind of a rod perturbation .",
    "we set the value of the rod pressure perturbation to be 10% of the axial pressure .",
    "we set the values of the other boundary conditions equal to zero because we want the perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk .",
    "we choose the 10% of the value of the axial pressure instead of the radial pressure because it has the lowest value near @xmath84 . in that way , the perturbation values are also below the 10% values of the radial pressure and the general linear perturbation is valid .    in fig .",
    "[ figmne ] , we present the perturbation amplitudes for the pressure , the physical radial velocity and the physical axial velocity , for @xmath95 and for different values of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we see in the pressure perturbation graph that the perturbation rapidly decays to values near zero when we move out from the center of the disk .",
    "this behavior is the same for every galaxy considered . in the velocity perturbations profiles we can see a phenomenon that is more clear in the flatter galaxy .",
    "note that in the lower domain of the disk [ -5,0 ) the axial velocity perturbation is positive and in the upper domain ( 0,5 ] the axial velocity perturbation is negative .",
    "this means that due to the linear perturbation the disk tries to collapse to the plane @xmath87 .",
    "now , if we look to the radial velocity perturbation graph , we note that the upper and lower parts depart from the center of the disk due to the positive radial perturbation .",
    "so , with these considerations , we may say that the disk tends to form some kind of ring around the center of the disk . this phenomenon is greater for highly flat galaxies and lower for more spherical systems .",
    "in this article we studied the stability of the recently proposed general relativistic miyamoto - nagai model [ @xcite ] by applying a general first order perturbation .",
    "we can say that the stability analysis performed is more complete than the stability analysis of particle motion along geodesics because we have taken into account the collective behavior of the particles . however , this analysis can be said to be incomplete because the energy momentum perturbation tensor of the fluid is treated as a test fluid and does not alter the background metric . this is a second degree of approximation to the stability problem in which the emission of gravitational radiation is considered .",
    "the different stability analyses made to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk show that this disk is stable for higher values of the wave number @xmath92 and the frequency @xmath83 . for lower values of @xmath92 and @xmath83 the disk presents not - stable modes that may form more complex structures like rings , bars or halos , but in order to study them we need a higher order perturbation formalism . in general , not - stable modes appear more for flatter galaxies and less for spherical systems .",
