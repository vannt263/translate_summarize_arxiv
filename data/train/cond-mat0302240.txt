    "despite its striking simplicity the perovskite structure , @xmath4 , contains numerous crystallographic variations giving room for a huge class of compounds @xcite . among these the vast majority",

    "+ for optimal tailoring of materials much work on the perovskite - related compounds concentrates on the interrelations between deviations from the ideal perovskite structure and physical properties .",
    "these crystallographic deviations can be grouped into three different mechanisms @xcite : while distortions of the characteristic @xmath5 octahedra and cation displacements within the octahedra are mainly driven by electronic instabilities of the octahedral metal ion , octahedral tiltings represent the most common deviation and are observed when the a cation is too small for filling the space between regularly ordered octahedra . in this situation ,",
    "octahedral tilting represents the lowest energy distortion , since it allows to adjust the a ",
    "o distances while leaving the first coordination sphere of the m cation intact , and changing mainly the soft m ",
    "o  m bond angle rather than the m  o bond length .",
    "+ of particular interest in this context are the perovskite - like compounds of the kind @xmath6 , where the b  o  b bond angle is the relevant quantity in order to optimize both the @xmath7o and @xmath8o bond lengths .",
    "studying these materials thus promises deeper insight into the mechanisms driving the octahedral tilting .",
    "in addition , this material class shows extraordinary physical properties .",
    "while @xmath9 is a ferromagnetic semiconductor with high curie temperature and large magnetoresistance @xcite , @xmath10 is known for its unusually high low - frequency dielectric constants @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the metallic ruthenates of the type @xmath0 ( a = na , ca , la ) are pauli paramagnets @xcite and display valence degeneracy @xcite . the crystal structures of the latter class have been studied recently by exafs and xrd , revealing considerable deviations of the measured interatomic distances from those expected from a bond valence approach @xcite .",
    "+ the present study investigates the relationship between the octahedral tiltings and the electronic properties of the ruthenates @xmath0 ( a = na , ca , sr , la , nd ) .",

    ", the a sites are partitioned into the a site at ( 0,0,0 ) and the @xmath8 site , which takes three quarters of the original a positions . in particular , the @xmath8 sites are strongly affected by the oxygen atom shifts away from the ideal position and thus their surrounding experiences the largest distortion . as a consequence , three different @xmath8o distances of @xmath24 2.0 , 2.8 , and 3.2  appear , each forming an approximately square - planar coordination and thus providing an ideal geometry for a jahn - teller active ion as e.g.  @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "whereas in the energy range from -3 to -2ev a sharp cu @xmath47 peak appears , electronic states between -2 and 0.5ev , and hence metallic conductivity , derive mainly from broader ru @xmath44 bands .",
    "covalent type bonding leads to finite oxygen @xmath45 contributions above -3ev .",

    "however , due to the higher @xmath1 electron count of cu as compared to ru , the @xmath50@xmath51 antibonding states are filled , leading to a vanishing contribution of these bonds to the chemical stability .",
    "in contrast , the integrated @xmath52@xmath51 covalent bond energy curve at @xmath48 has a finite value indicative of the stabilizing net contribution of this bond .",
    "finally , metal - metal bonding results in small peaks between -3 and -2ev and above the fermi energy . + all states which are not displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] play only a very small role in the energy interval shown .",
    "in particular , apart from the nd @xmath46 states , the a cation electrons do not contribute to the covalent - type bonding but are distributed over the solid .",
    "as a consequence , changes at the a cation site show up mainly in the modified total electron count .",
    "+ ebbinghaus _ et al . _",
    "@xcite related the measured atomic distances for @xmath0 ( a = na , ca , sr , la , nd ) to the predictions of the bond valence model .",

    "+ in order to understand the influence of octahedral tilting on the electronic properties and to analyze the mentioned discrepancies reported by ebbinghaus _",
    "we performed additional calculations using hypothetical crystal structures . in these setups",
    "the oxygen atoms were shifted away from the measured positions to the ideal position @xmath53 , @xmath54 and to @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "these positions correspond to zero tilting of the octahedra and to an exaggerated tilting , respectively .",
    "note that shifting the oxygen position mainly affects the cu ",
    "o bond lengths , while the effect for the ru  o and a  o distances is of second order .",

    "[ fig : res1 ] ) are observed . turning to the ideal structure first , we observe ( i ) a considerable broadening of the o @xmath45 dominated states and ( ii ) a striking sharpening of the cu @xmath47 states .",
    "both effects are readily understood from the oxygen shifts .",
    "the latter cause an increase of the cu  o distances and , to a lesser degree , a decrease of the ru  o distances , leading to a slightly larger @xmath45@xmath44 overlap . as a consequence ,",
    "larger ru @xmath44 contributions at energies below -3ev are observed , whereas the cu @xmath47 fraction is almost negligible in this region . at the same time , ru @xmath44 and o @xmath45 admixture to the sharp cu @xmath47 peak is likewise very small . to sum up",
    ", shifting the oxygen atoms to their ideal positions leads to an effective decoupling of the compound into @xmath3 octahedra and cu atoms , which are effectively separated and thus do no longer form a stable solid . + on the contrary , for the hypothetical structure with the oxygen shift away from the ideal position exaggerated ( i ) the oxygen states have moved to lower energies and ( ii ) the cu @xmath47 states do no longer form a distinct peak but have attained a rather itinerant character .",
    "the latter goes along with an increased similarity of the cu @xmath47 and o @xmath45 partial dos . the increased covalent type bonding between these two states is also reflected by large contributions to the covalent bond energy ( not shown ) , negative below -4ev and positive above , leading to a net antibonding integral at @xmath48 .",
    "the increased @xmath45@xmath47 bonding is in contrast to a slight decrease of the bonding between the ru @xmath44 and o @xmath45 states due to the larger extension of the @xmath3 octahedra .",
    "thus the hypothetical structure with exaggerated oxygen shifts likewise suffers from an increase of antibonding at the expense of bonding states . + together with the instability of the hypothetical structure with ideal oxygen positions we conclude that the experimental structure is due to an optimal balance of different types of bonds , namely @xmath45@xmath47 and @xmath45@xmath44 .",
    "this balance is less affected by the a cations , which do not take part in covalent bonding but have lost their outer electrons .",
    "for this reason , from the point of view of chemical bonding , there is no means to optimize the a ",
    "o bond length .",
    "moreover , as for the ru  o distance , the a ",
    "o distance is only to a small degree affected by the tilting .",
    "finally , the different types of bonding present in these compounds give an additional explanation for the deviations of the experimental interatomic distances from those expected from the bond valence model .",
    "the electronic properties of the perovskite - like ruthenates @xmath0 are governed by strong covalent bonding between the transition metal @xmath1 and the oxygen @xmath45 electrons . while ru ",
    "o bonds via the corresponding bond - lengths influence mainly the size of the octahedra and hence the lattice constant , the octahedral tilting is to a large part due to the cu  o bonding . +",
    "as compared to the ideal perovskite structure the tilting of the characteristic @xmath3 octahedra has only little effect on the ru ",
    "o bonding .",
    "in contrast , the cu  o distances undergo serious changes , leading eventually to the square - planar coordination of copper .",
    "finally , the unusual a  o distances and the failure of the bond valence approach are due to the fact that their response to the tilting is only small and the structure does not offer any possibility to simultaneously optimize the a  o and the cu  o bond lengths .",
    "+ in conclusion , octahedral tilting as discussed for @xmath0 , arises from the interplay of covalent bonding between different atomic species , leading to optimized bond lengths between all atoms involved .",
