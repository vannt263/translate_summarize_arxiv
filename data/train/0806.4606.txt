    "observations of secondary eclipses in exoplanetary systems , starting with hd  209458b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( deming et al . 2005 ) ) and tres-1b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( charbonneau et al . 2005 ) ) , made it possible to estimate the integrated day - side brightness of transiting exoplanets .",
    "constraining the _ global _ brightness map of exoplanets , on the other hand , requires observations at various orbital phases , involving more sophisticated calibration of observations , much longer observing campaigns , or both .",
    "the first measurements of thermal phase curves for exoplanet systems were reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* harrington et al . ( 2006 ) ) , which reported a large phase function for @xmath0 andromeda  b , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cowan , agol & charbonneau ( 2007 ) ) , which detected a phase function for hd  179949b , and obtained useful upper limits for hd  209458b and 51  peg  b. these results proved valuable in constraining the day - night brightness contrast and hence the energy recirculation efficiency of those planets and indicated that hot jupiters represent a heterogeneous group .",
    "those first two studies , however , had very incomplete phase coverage ( 5 epochs for the ( * ? ? ? *",
    "harrington et al . 2006 ) campaign , and 8 epochs for each of the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cowan et al . 2007 ) campaigns ) .",
    "furthermore , three of the four observed planets were not in transiting systems , and the one transiting system ( hd  209458 ) was deliberately observed outside of transit or secondary eclipse .",
    "the @xmath1  hours of continuous monitoring of hd  189733b presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* knutson et al . ( 2007 ) ) differs in three important ways from those first detections of phase variations : 1 ) the observed system exhibits transits , so the planet s orbital inclination with respect to the celestial plane is known .",
    "2 ) a secondary eclipse of the planet was observed during the course of the observations , making it possible to quantify not just the relative but the _ absolute _ flux of the planet as a function of orbital phase .",
    "3 ) the continuous observing campaign , the system s relative proximity to the earth , its favorable contrast ratio , and ingenious corrections for detector systematics conspired to produce the highest s / n light curve of its kind ever measured .",
    "although the observations spanned little more than half an orbit of hd  189733b , the unprecedented quality of the light curve enabled us not only to measure the planet s day / night contrast , but also to generate the first ever brightness map of an extrasolar planet .",
    "there are three necessary and sufficient conditions for phase function mapping to be feasible ( see also the orginal formalism of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* russell , 1906 ) ) :    1 .",
    "one must be able to remove from the observed light curve any stellar variability ( eg : star spots rotating into and out of view ) as well as detector systematics ( detector ramps , intra - pixel sensitivity , etc . ) .",
    "* knutson et al . ( 2008 ) ) presents the most sophisticated treatment of these effects to date .",
    "2 .   one must neglect limb darkening in the planet s atmosphere .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation at mid - ir wavelengths , leading to errors of less than 1% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( cowan & agol 2008 ) ) .",
    "3 .   one must assume that the large - scale weather of the planet is in a steady - state .",
    "this means that the global hot spots , cold spots and jet streams do not vary in brightness or shift with respect to the substellar point over a single planetary orbit .",
    "this assumption appears to hold at the 510% level for hot jupiters on circular orbits ( agol et al . in prep ) .",
    "for an edge - on system we define the phase angle @xmath2 , which corresponds to the observer  planet  star angle ( @xmath3 at secondary eclipse ; @xmath4 at transit ) , as well as the longitude , @xmath5 , and latitude , @xmath6 , in a rotating frame , such that @xmath7 at the sub - stellar point , @xmath8 at the planet s north pole , and @xmath5 increases in the same sense as @xmath2 .",
    "the condition of a steady - state weather pattern can be expressed as requiring that the specific intensity , @xmath9 , is unchanging with time .",
    "there are no current observations which can constrain the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath10 , but for edge - on orbits the latitudinal dependence of the intensity is unimportant since one can define @xmath11 , which represents the flux contribution from an infinitesimal slice of the planet when viewed face - on .",
    "the flux , @xmath12 , we observe from the planet at a given orbital phase can then be written as a convolution , @xmath13 , with the piece - wise defined kernel , @xmath14 .",
    "the kernel represents the response of the phase function to a delta function in @xmath15 , and it is very broad , with a full width at half - maximum of @xmath16 , as shown by the solid line in the left panel of figure  [ slice_kernels ] .",
    "the convolution described in the previous section transforms a given longitudinal map into an observed light curve .",
    "the more challenging problem if how to reliably de - convolve an observed light curve to obtain the longitudinal map of a planet . in (",
    "* cowan & agol ( 2008 ) ) we presented two complementary models ( examples of which are shown in the right panel of figure  [ slice_kernels ] ) , described below .",
    "* n - slice model : * this model consists of equal - size longitudinal slices of uniform brightness ( think beach ball ) .",
    "such maps simplify the convolution , enabling the use of brute force numerical techniques ( least - squares , mcmc , etc . ) to determine the best - fit longitudinal map given an observed light curve .",
    "this approach is versatile , easily adapted to non - transiting planets or planets with incomplete light curves .",
    "although an n - slice longitudinal map is neither differentiable nor realistic , smoothing the map does not significantly change the resulting light curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the brightness of the different slices do not depend on the light curve in a linearly independent fashion , so using too many slices to model a light curve with poor s / n makes the uncertainty in _ all _ of the slices blow up .",
    "* sinusoidal model : * sinusoids are orthogonal eigenfunctions of the convolution described in ",
    "an observed light curve can therefore be decomposed via a fourier expansion , then trivially transformed into a sinusoidal map using equation  7 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cowan & agol ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "sinusoidal longitudinal maps have the advantage of being imminently believable , but for incomplete phase curves the uncertainty in the map does not have have the properties one would like .",
    "for example , if a phase function is only obtained for half of a planetary orbit , the uncertainty in the map is no greater for the hemisphere which was not well observed . fortunately , warm spitzer s propensity for longer observing campaigns will be perfectly suited for obtaining full phase curves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( deming et al . 2007 ) ) .    , @xmath17 and @xmath18 sinusoidal maps , while the right panel shows the resulting phase variations",
    "the higher - frequency modes are damped out because a full hemisphere is visible at any point in time.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the sinusoidal model provides an instructive tool for studying the mapping problem , since the maps and associated light curves are simple analytic functions .",
    "figure  [ sinusoidal_maps ] shows how the smoothing kernel suppresses high - frequency spatial brightness variations .",
    "this is a direct consequence of seeing half of the planet at a time .",
    "technically , one only sees @xmath19 of the planet particularly well at any point in time ( recall the @xmath16 fwhm ) .",
    "this leads to the pernicious problem shown in figure figure  [ odd_sinusoidal_maps ] : the kernel entirely wipes out odd sinusoidal modes ( except for @xmath20 ) .",
    "in other words , if a planet s dominant weather consisted of three equally spaced hot spots near its equator , it would exhibit _ no _ phase variations !",
    "the invisibility of odd modes is not merely an intellectual curiosity : it sets a hard limit on the accuracy of longitudinal maps .",
    "if the @xmath21 modes in the planet s longitudinal brightness profile are not visible , there is not much to be gained by extending the fourier expansion to @xmath22 , etc .",
    "those modes may well be precisely measured , but this will do nothing to increase the _ accuracy _ of the resulting planet map . to flip this problem on its head , a simple way to test the assumptions of   2 is to look for @xmath21 modes in the observed light curve .",
    "the bottom line is that one can do no better than a second - order fourier expansion of an observed light curve : @xmath23 . by the same token ,",
    "a limit of 5 free parameters ( 4 slices @xmath24 a phase offset , or just 5 slices ) applies to the n - slice maps .",
    "maps with many more parameters than this can be made , but should be treated with skepticism .          ,",
