    "the circular restricted three - body problem describes the gravitational interaction between three masses , in which two primaries @xmath1 and @xmath2 are moving in circular orbits around their common center of mass , while a third body @xmath3 whose mass is very small compared to the two others ( its gravitational influence on the primaries is negligible ) , moves in the plane of the primaries .",
    "many studies have been carried out in the newtonian version of this problem . in particular , the stability of the lagrangian points has attracted the attention of many scientists ( see e.g. @xcite ) , due to the possible applications to many different astronomical systems @xcite : earth - moon system with a spacecraft , sun - earth - moon system , sun - jupiter system with an asteroid , binary stellar systems with exoplanets , among others . concerning dynamical studies , gonczi and froeschle , by using the lyapunov characteristic numbers @xcite and surfaces of section @xcite , respectively , have shown that the circular restricted three - body problem is chaotic .    to account for relativistic effects on motions of astronomical bodies , in 1967 ,",
    "krefetz extended the investigation of this problem to general relativity @xcite . instead of solving the full einstein equations",
    ", he used the einstein - infeld - hoffmann ( eih ) formalism @xcite to calculate the first - order post - newtonian equations of motion ( pn1 ) in a synodic frame of reference .",
    "an alternative derivation of these equations for the general and restricted three body problem was performed by brumberg @xcite , who introduced a new parameter @xmath0 denoting the mean motion of the primaries .",
    "many years later , maindl and dvorak rederived the equations of motion of the test particle @xmath3 and applied its results to the computation of the advance of mercury perihelion @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that despite the fact that all the three different approaches used the eih formalism up to pn1 order , do not lead to the same set of equations , mainly due to the introduction of different relativistic parameters : krefetz introduced a relativistic parameter related to the coordinate transformation to the synodic frame of reference , brumberg introduced the mean motion parameter , and maindl considered the relativistic effects in the angular velocity of the primaries .",
    "the study of the dynamics in the post - newtonian restricted three body problem is very recent , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in 2014 ,",
    "huang and wu @xcite studied the effects on the dynamics of the distance between the primaries by applying scaling transformations to distance and time .",
    "to do so , the authors used the equations derived by maindl and dvorak @xcite , including the modified angular speed outlined by contopoulos @xcite for the pn circular two - body problem . as we will show in the present paper ,",
    "the use of the maindl s equations is not adequate to perform dynamical studies , due to the non - conservation of the jacobian constant .",
    "taking into account the previous arguments , in this paper we have rederived the equations of motion for the planar restricted three body problem using the eih formalism up to pn1 order .",
    "in this new system of equations , we do not neglect terms higher than @xmath4 , which appear from the introduction of the pn angular velocity , nor made any additional approximation different to the one of the lagrangian . under these conditions the jacobian constant is conserved to a good approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:1 ] , we show the lagrangian for @xmath0-bodies in the post - newtonian approximation and derive the equations of motion for the test particle in the planar circular restricted three body problem . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we compare the conservation of the jacobian integral obtained with both approaches , the one presented in this work and the one derived by maindl . on the other hand ,",
    "a typical dynamical analysis of the poincar surfaces of section is performed .",
    "finally in section [ sec:3 ] , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the equations of motion for a system of @xmath0 bodies in the post - newtonian approximation were first obtained by a. einstein , l. infeld , and b. hoffmann @xcite and independently by a. eddington and g. clark @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian was presented by l. landau , taking into account correction up to the order @xmath4 @xcite and is given by @xmath5+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j\\ne i}^{n}\\frac{g m_{i } m_{j}}{2 r_{i j}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "when considering the lagrangian of a single particle with mass @xmath3 , at position @xmath8 , with velocity @xmath9 , and in the presence of @xmath10 other bodies at positions @xmath11 with respective velocities @xmath12 , the previous expression can be written as @xcite @xmath13   + o(c^{-4}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 .",
    "now , let us to consider the planar circular restricted three body problem ( henceforth crtbp ) .",
    "in this case two primaries @xmath15 and @xmath16 move in circular orbits around their common center of mass , at a fixed distance @xmath17 , such that the test particle will not affect the motion of the primaries . under these considerations and introducing a synodic frame of reference through the transformations , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , the lagrangian ( [ lk ] ) of the test particle reads as ( cf .",
