    "there exists a refinement of @xmath9 called link floer homology @xcite , which detects the thurston norm of the link complement @xcite . for the purposes of this paper , we will consider all the theories with coefficients in @xmath10 and usually ignore all their gradings .",
    "the three theories mentioned above are rather different in origin .",
    "khovanov s theory was developed out of a study of representation theory and categorification , and was defined in a purely combinatorial fashion to start with . on the other hand , the floer homologies @xmath11 and @xmath8",
    "were originally constructed using pseudolomorphic disks , and a combinatorial description of them has only recently been found ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "one connection between @xmath2 and @xmath11 was pointed out by ozsvth and szab in @xcite .",
    "they observed that both of these theories satisfy unoriented skein exact triangles .",
    "more precisely , consider three links @xmath12 and @xmath13 that admit planar diagrams differing from each other only at one crossing , where they look as in figure  [ fig : skein ] .",
    "then there is an exact triangle @xmath14 where the symbol @xmath15 could stand for either @xmath16 or @xmath17 one can iterate this exact triangle by applying it to all crossings of @xmath1 via some homological algebra , the result of this iteration process is a spectral sequence whose @xmath18 term is khovanov homology , and which converges to @xmath19 this implies an inequality of ranks : @xmath20 in @xcite , ozsvth and szab defined a class of links , called quasi - alternating links , for which ( [ ineq ] ) becomes equality and , furthermore , the ranks of the two theories are equal to @xmath21 the determinant of the link . in particular , all alternating links are quasi - alternating .",

    "[ main ] let @xmath6 be a link in @xmath22 given a planar diagram of @xmath6 , let @xmath23 and @xmath13 be the two resolutions of @xmath6 at a crossing in that diagram , as in figure  [ fig : skein ] . denote by @xmath24 the number of components of the links @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , and set @xmath27 then , there is an exact triangle @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a two - dimensional vector space over @xmath30    ozsvth and szab @xcite , @xcite proved that @xmath31 when @xmath6 is an alternating link with @xmath32 components . a simple consequence of theorem  [ main ] is a generalization of their result :    [ cor ] if @xmath6 is a quasi - alternating link with @xmath32 components , then @xmath33    rasmussen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) observed that @xmath16 and @xmath9 have equal ranks for many classes of knots ( including most small knots ) , and asked for an explanation .",
    "corollary  [ cor ] can be viewed as a partial answer to his question . indeed , as we show in section  [ sec :",
    "qa ] , many small knots are quasi - alternating .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , a more convincing explanation for the similarities between @xmath16 and @xmath9 ( for knots ) would be a spectral sequence whose @xmath18 term is @xmath16 and which converges to @xmath34 ( for links of @xmath32 components , @xmath16 should be replaced with @xmath35 . )",
    "this would imply an inequality of ranks similar to ( [ ineq ] ) , namely @xmath36 in turn , using the fact that @xmath9 detects the unknot @xcite , this would provide a positive answer to the following well - known conjecture :    [ unknot ] if @xmath37 is a knot with @xmath38 then @xmath37 is the unknot .",
    "unfortunately , theorem  [ main ] does not directly imply the inequality of ranks and hence conjecture  [ unknot ] .",
    "one can iterate the unoriented skein triangle for @xmath9 and obtain a spectral sequence whose @xmath39 term is @xmath40 for some large @xmath41 however , the presence of the @xmath29 factors makes it unclear whether the @xmath18 term of the spectral sequence is related to khovanov homology .",
    "we leave this as an open problem .",
    "we end this introduction with some remarks .",
    "first , the exact triangle from theorem  [ main ] is different from the other exact triangles in floer homology , in that the maps do not even respect the homological gradings modulo @xmath42 also , the proof only works for the hat version of @xmath43 and it is not clear whether a similar triangle holds for the other versions .",
    "finally , in this paper we only use the traditional definition of knot floer homology , based on counting pseudo - holomorphic disks . it would be interesting to recover the same result , and perhaps do further computations , using the combinatorial definition of @xcite instead .",

    "we will use a special class of heegaard diagrams , which are particular cases of the multiply - pointed diagrams defined in ( * ? ? ? * section2 ) .",

    "let @xmath44 be a link with @xmath32 components and @xmath45 a planar , connected projection of @xmath1 if @xmath45 has @xmath46 crossings , then it splits the plane into @xmath47 regions .",
