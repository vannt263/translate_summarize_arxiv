    "noble gases are known to provide scintillation light with high yield , comparable to that of nai(tl ) .",
    "detection of this light proves fundamental in many applications in which noble gas is used as medium ( for example in tpcs the prompt scintillation light is used for triggering and @xmath1 determination ) .",
    "difficulties arise from the fact that noble gas emission is peaked in the deep ultraviolet ( duv ) range . to detect such light , wavelength shifter - coated photomultiplier tubes ( pmts )",
    "have often been used , resulting in a very low global quantum efficiency .",
    "there is interest in knowing if large area avalanche photo - diodes ( laapds ) could be a viable alternative , in particular in applications where the radiopurity of the pmt s glass is a concern ( e.g. direct dark matter searches , detection of solar neutrinos , etc . ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper show that it is in principle possible to detect gas scintillation from kr , xe and ar with apds with a quantum efficiency higher than with pmts . the issues related to the signal to noise of apds , to the parallel operation of a large number of apds to increase the sensitive area and the mechanical problems at potential cryogenic temperatures remain to be solved .",
    "gas excitation and ionization can lead to the emission of scintillation photons in the duv range via the processes @xcite of excitation @xmath2 and ionization @xmath3 the possible emission of non - uv light , mostly in the ir region , is attributed to the transitions between excited atomic states .",
    "indeed , the atomic spectrum of argon shows several very intense lines at wavelength 700 - 1050 nm .",
    "a set of lines located between 400 - 500 nm has intensities below 3 @xmath0 of the most intense lines found in the infrared region .    according to @xcite",
    ", the average energy expended per ion pair @xmath4 can be related to the ionization potential @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of ions produced at an average energy expenditure of @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the number of excited atoms produced at an average expenditure of @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the average kinetic energy of sub - excitation electrons .",
    "equation [ eq : wgi ] can also be applied to condensed noble gas if @xmath5 is substituted by the band - gap energy @xmath12 .",
    "values used for calculations in this work are shown in table  [ tab : ionization ] .",
    "the energy balance equation is energy dependent in all four every terms , however , for @xmath13 this dependence is weak . for @xmath14-particles in argon",
    ", @xmath15 ev at energies @xmath16 mev . for @xmath17 mev ,",
    "the value is only somewhat higher at @xmath18 , increasing further as the kinetic energy is reduced .",
    "our measurements were performed in a pressure range where the scintillation is brought forth by @xmath14 particles with at least 0.5 mev kinetic energy .",
    ".values used for calculations in this work .",
    "energies are expressed in ev . from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the mechanism of duv light emission in low pressure noble gas occurs on a time scale of several microseconds , see  @xcite .",
    "therefore , not all charge is integrated when running measurements at shaping times that optimize energy resolution .",
    "series of data ( not listed in table [ tab : ar ] ) were taken at different shaping times .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ sha ] , where the signal height is plotted in arbitrary units as a function of the shaping time used .",
    "the data was fitted to a function @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the shaping time in microseconds .",
    "the fitted decay frequency of @xmath21 is comparable to the value @xmath22 obtained by @xcite .",
    "we conclude for argon pressures above .678 atmospheres , the use of 10 @xmath23s shaping time guarantees the integration of at least 94@xmath0 of the full signal .",
    "long shaping times are necessary to integrate full charge .",
    "plot shows relative signal size for different shaping times .",
    "data taken in argon at 0.8 atm and 280 degrees k. plotted errors are solely statistical . ]",
    "this fact is confirmed by the data taken .",
    "the series taken at 5 @xmath23s shaping time shows a clear pressure dependence , see table [ tab : ar ] and figure [ arp ] .",
    "the series taken with 10 @xmath23s shaping time shows no systematic pressure dependence .     the plot shows a systematic pressure dependence of data taken at short shaping times , 5@xmath23s in the case of the data plotted by the square markers .",
    "the data taken at 10@xmath23s shaping time , plotted as circles , shows no systematic pressure dependence .",
    "the error bars do not include errors on @xmath24 . ]",
    "the energy resolution is optimized at a finite value of shaping time . for measurements performed at an apd temperature of @xmath25c , the best energy resolution of @xmath26",
    "is achieved with 2 @xmath23s shaping .",
    "as the apd temperature is reduced , dark current and consequently parallel noise decreases , reducing the loss of resolution at long shaping times .",
    "non - uv emission is assumed to be emitted from atomic transitions before dimer formation .    for argon , measurements were performed to allow the subtraction of the possible non - uv contribution .",
    "this was done by replacing the duv - enhanced laapd by a red / ir - enhanced laapd from the same manufacturer .",
    "the measurements are shown in table  [ tab : arir ] .",
    "note that @xmath27 in the table represents the number of expected duv photons .",
    "the device , however , is not primarily sensitive to this wavelength .",
    "therefore , the signal normalized to the expected number of duv photons should not be interpreted directly as a quantum efficiency .",
    "rather , this result is to be interpreted as a significant contribution of non - uv photons to argon scintillation light .    because of its direct production mechanism , non",
    "- uv emission should occur on a faster time scale than duv emission .",
    "our non - uv measurements were performed at 1 @xmath23s shaping time . note from table [ tab : arir ] that no systematic pressure dependence of the non - uv signal seems to be present .",
    "this observation is consistent with the attribution of non - uv emission to transitions between excited atomic states which are precursors of dimer ( duv ) emission .",
    "the red / ir enhanced laapd has an @xmath28 anti - reflective coating . in general",
    ", @xmath28 is opaque to uv light .",
    "it is not clear to what extent such an effect attenuates 128 nm light passing through this 150 nm thin coating .",
    "we do not a priori exclude a residual sensitivity of the red / ir enhanced device to duv light .    to reduce this ambiguity , a plastic foil of 0.1 mm thickness was employed , mounted in front of the red / ir - enhanced device .",
    "it can be assumed that this foil has no transmittance in the duv range , and a finite transmittance in the red / ir range .",
    "the foil caused a signal reduction of 34@xmath0 , see table [ tab : arir ] .",
    "this leads us to conclude that at least 65@xmath0 of the unfiltered signal detected with the red / ir - enhanced laapd can be attributed to non - uv photons .",
    "from now on , we use the super - index @xmath29 when referring to the red / ir - enhanced apd .",
    "likewise , the super - index @xmath30 denotes the duv - enhanced device . the number of non - uv photons is written as @xmath31 .",
    "values of quantum efficiency always are a function of the wavelength given in parenthesis .    using the data listed in table [ tab : arir ] , we can give a strict lower limit for the branching ratio @xmath32 of the emission of non - uv photons in argon .",
    "the number of non - uv photons impinging on the red / ir - enhanced laapd relates to the detected charge signal in linear dependence of gain and quantum efficiency : @xmath33 the expression is minimized by the maximum quantum efficiency of the red / ir - enhanced apd , giving the expression @xmath34 where @xmath35 was used . by comparison with @xmath36 ( see section  [ sec : nobgas ] ) , the obtained value can be translated into @xmath37 a strict upper limit for the average amount of energy needed to produce a non - uv photon in argon gas around this pressure .    with the data in table [ tab : arir ]",
    ", the quantum efficiency of the duv - enhanced laapd for radiation at 128 nm can be calculated more precisely @xmath38 where @xmath39 refers to the left side of equation [ eq : eqcal ] and the last term is the correction for the sensitivity of the duv - enhanced device to any non - uv photons of wavelength @xmath40 emitted .    as a strict lower limit",
    ", @xmath41 and , as an upper limit @xmath42 can be given .",
    "thus , @xmath43 where the upper limit is not rigorous as quenching effects due to gas impurities have not been accounted for .",
    "if argon non - uv emission is centered around 940 nm as measured by @xcite , this would result in an in - between value of @xmath44 .",
    "note that over a large region of the ir spectrum , the ratio of @xmath45 is relatively constant , making @xmath46 relatively insensitive to the exact wavelength of peak ir emission .    in xenon and krypton , the non - uv contribution was not quantitatively measured .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the duv - enhanced laapd : the continuous curve depicts the values given by the manufacturer , see figure [ apiqe ] .",
    "the circles represent the values from tables [ tab : ar ] , [ tab : krxe ] , and [ tab : xe ] at argon , krypton , and xenon emission wavelengths .",
    "the square markers include the correction for non - uv components ( see section  [ irc ] ) . ]",
    "deep ultraviolet light can be detected by laapds with significantly higher quantum efficiency than by conventional means such as photomultipliers .",
    "our data is consistent with the fact that argon gas at low pressure emits a significant amount of non - uv light .",
    "a strict upper limit for the average energy necessary to produce a non - uv photon in argon gas at a pressure below 1 atm is given .",
    "a lower limit can not be given since our device is not sensitive throughout the ir full spectrum .",
    "the given limits for the @xmath46 apply for argon non - uv emission down to 270 nm .",
    "since impurity quenching was not considered , the lower limit of @xmath47 is strict while the upper limit is not . for non - uv emission centered around 940",
    "nm @xmath48 is obtained .",
    "figure  [ qeffdec ] summarizes the obtained results for argon , krypton , and xenon .",
    "our measurements are consistent with the manufacturer s data where it is available .",
    "the non - uv correction was only measured for argon . for xenon and krypton",
    "this correction is of illustrative nature only .",
    "error bars do not include inaccuracies of @xmath49 , nor do they include quenching effects which lead to efficiency under - estimation .",
    "our results tend to underestimate the quantum efficiency .",
    "this may be attributed to the presence of uv attenuating impurities , whose presence are not considered in the calculation . if this is the case , the effect can be expected to be more severe at shorter wavelengths . in this sense ,",
    "our measurement of the quantum efficiency at 128 nm is to be seen as a lower limit .",
    "we are indebted to the infn padova group who has cordially lent us the readout electronics necessary for the measurements .",
