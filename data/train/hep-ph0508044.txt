    "recently , there has been some interest in relations between the lepton mixing angle @xmath12 and the cabibbo angle @xmath13 @xcite , often referred to as quark - lepton complementarity ( qlc ) .",
    "it was initiated from the observation that current best fit values ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are compatible with an intriguing relation @xmath14 .",
    "one conclusion was that if a relation between the cabibbo angle and @xmath12 were found , this could point towards quark - lepton unification .",
    "in addition , further relations between the lepton mixings @xmath8 and @xmath15 and quark mixings have been proposed .",
    "the general idea is that specific predictions from the neutrino sector , i.e.  for the solar angle , get modified by the charged lepton mixings @xcite such as @xmath4 , and that these corrections from the charged lepton sector can be be related to quark mixings in quark - lepton unified theories .",
    "while the above relation , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 add up to @xmath16 , was based on bimaximal neutrino mixing , another interesting complementarity emerges if the neutrino sector predicts tri - bimaximal mixing @xcite , which can naturally be realized with non - abelian flavour symmetry so(3 ) @xcite or su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "motivated by this recent interest in charged lepton corrections to neutrino mixings , we re - analyze this issue in this note .",
    "we shall first present simple formulae for including the charged lepton corrections , which allow to discuss the effects analytically .",
    "since the two types of complementarity scenarios involve small 1 - 3 mixing @xmath0 from the neutrino sector , we then mainly focus on this case and find some interesting results : for small neutrino and charged lepton mixings @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we find for instance the new relation @xmath17 which connects the prediction @xmath3 for the solar mixing from the neutrino sector to the charged lepton mixing @xmath4 and to the mns cp phase relevant for neutrino oscillations @xmath5 .",
    "compared to previous works which consider charged lepton contributions @xcite , the general relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : newrelationfort12 ] ) holds model - independently as long as the neutrino and charged lepton mixings @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small .",
    "it is surprisingly compact and shows that under the above conditions , measuring the mns cp phase @xmath5 is essential for testing any model predictions for the neutrino mixing @xmath3 modified by charged lepton corrections .    the compact formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : newrelationfort12 ] ) may be used as a basis for studying quark - lepton complementarity , if the charged lepton mixing angle @xmath18 is related to the cabibbo angle @xmath19 .",
    "the exact type of complementarity depends on the prediction for the neutrino mixing angle @xmath3 , specifically either @xmath20 in the case of bi - maximal complementarity , or @xmath21 in the case of tri - bimaximal complementarity . in both cases , eq .",
    "( [ eq : newrelationfort12 ] ) shows that the presence of the leptonic cp phase @xmath5 plays a crucial role in any complementarity relation .",
    "indeed bimaximal complementarity in its simple form is seen to be disfavored in the presence of leptonic cp violation ( i.e.@xmath22 ) .",
    "tri - bimaximal complementarity gives testable predictions , which however require a measurement of @xmath5 in addition to a more precise measurement of @xmath12 . in the context of tri - bimaximal complementarity @xcite , the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : newrelationfort12 ] ) with the specific prediction for @xmath21 has been found in a specific model .",
    "discussions of charged lepton contributions to neutrino mixings in other specific scenarios , such as for instance bi - maximal neutrino mixing , can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , as we will show , the general relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : newrelationfort12 ] ) holds model - independently , as long as @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small . for small @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the total lepton mixing @xmath8 is induced from the charged lepton correction @xmath4 , which leads to the relation @xmath23 independent of cp phases .",
    "this means that if the charged lepton mixing @xmath4 is related to the cabibbo angle @xmath24 in any form , this would show up more directly in @xmath8 than in the solar angle @xmath12 .",
    "combining these results leads to a model - independent sum rule : _",
    "13(- ) ^_12 [ sumrule ] where @xmath25 in the case of bimaximal neutrino mixing , or @xmath26 in the case of tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , for example .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that under the generic assumption of small @xmath0 and @xmath1 the combined measurement of the lepton mixings @xmath12 , @xmath8 and of the mns cp phase @xmath5 in future precision experiments on neutrino oscillations has the potential to reveal if there are any symmetries determining the neutrino mixing @xmath27 .    in the most general case ,",
    "if we relax the condition of small @xmath0 and @xmath1 , charged lepton cp phases still modify the charged lepton corrections to the solar mixing angle , however the relevant cp phase is then not related to the low energy cp phase @xmath5 observable ( in principle ) in future neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "then the situation is similar to the charged lepton correction to @xmath15 : since it depends on charged lepton cp phases which are not related to @xmath5 and just marginally contribute to one of the majorana cp phases , we conclude that it is not realistic to expect any generic complementarity relation for @xmath15 .",
    "the maximal charged lepton correction to @xmath15 is @xmath28 , which is nevertheless interesting with respect to future precision neutrino experiments .",
    "before we discuss charged lepton corrections , it is necessary to specify the definition of lepton mixings and our conventions for the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices : the dirac mass matrices of the charged leptons is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the lagrangian is of the form @xmath31 we will focus on three light majorana neutrinos in the following , with the neutrino mass being defined by the lagrangian @xmath32 the change from flavour basis to mass eigenbasis can be performed with the unitary diagonalization matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 by @xmath35 the mns matrix , the mixing matrix in the lepton sector , is then given by @xmath36 after eliminating so - called unphysical phases as usual , by charged lepton phase rotations , the mns matrix can be parameterized as @xmath37 using the matrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 and where @xmath41 and @xmath42 stand for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 contains the majorana phases @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath5 is the dirac cp phase relevant for neutrino oscillations .",
    "another useful parameterization , in particular for including charged lepton corrections , is @xcite @xmath47 with matrices @xmath48 being defined as @xmath49 one can easily switch between these two conventions using the identities @xcite    [ eq : dict]@xmath50    and the fact that @xmath51 remains the same in both notations .",
    "we will use the latter convention in the following and introduce the more common phase convention @xmath52 if appropriate , in particular for making the connection to the dirac cp phase @xmath5 observable in neutrino oscillations .",
    "we will now consider the situation that bi - large neutrino mixing stems mainly from the neutrino sector , and that the mixing angles induced by the charged leptons can be considered as corrections . in this approximation",
    ", we will derive formulae which allow to include corrections to neutrino mixing angles and cp phases conveniently .",
    "we will see that special care has to be taken when dealing with complex phases from the charged lepton sector .    parameterizing the neutrino and charged lepton diagonalization matrices in @xmath53 and @xmath54 an analogous way to eq .",
    "( [ eq : u23u13u12 ] ) , we can write @xmath55 as @xcite @xmath56 the additional unphysical phases have been shifted to the left and then absorbed , as usual , by charged lepton phase rotations . the procedure for extracting the charged lepton and neutrino angles and phases",
    "is given in great detail in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this parameterization",
    ", the mns matrix can be conveniently expanded in terms of neutrino and charged lepton mixing angles and phases to leading order in small quantities , i.e.  in the charged lepton mixing angles and in @xmath0 : ) has been corrected . ]    [ eq:23 ] s_23e^-i_23 & & s_23^e^-i_23^ -_23^ c_23^e^-i_23^ [ chlep23 ] + [ eq:13 ] _ 13e^-i_13 & & _",

    "( [ eq : dict ] ) it is simple to express the phases on the left - hand side in terms of the phases @xmath57 and @xmath5 , if desired . before we turn to applications ,",
    "let us remark that since we have assumed that the two large lepton mixing angles @xmath15 and @xmath12 stem mainly from the neutrino sector , the phases @xmath58 and thus also @xmath57 are mainly determined from the neutrino sector , with only small corrections from the charged lepton sector .    with this respect , @xmath8 and the dirac cp phase @xmath5 are very different",
    ": since we only know that the total lepton mixing @xmath8 is rather small and without making further assumptions , it can stem from the neutrino mixing @xmath0 or it can alternatively be mainly induced from the charged lepton mixings @xmath1 and/or @xmath4 . in the latter case",
    ", the charged lepton corrections also mainly determine the dirac cp phase @xmath5 , observable in neutrino oscillations .",
    "let us finally note that lepton mixing angles are subject to renormalization group ( rg ) running between high energy , where models typically predict the flavour structure , and low energy , where experiments are performed .",
    "a numerical calculation of the rg corrections can be performed with the software packages reap / mpt introduced in @xcite .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "one interesting special case is that @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 are rather small , i.e.  @xmath60 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) and using the leading order relations @xmath61 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dict13 ] ) , we obtain @xmath62 and it follows that @xmath63 let us note that for instance in scenarios with an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy and a majorana parity between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 and the dirac cp phase @xmath5 is simply given by the charged lepton phase @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , we obtain @xmath68 the charged lepton 1 - 2 mixing generates @xmath8 independent of charged lepton cp phases .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) , the solar mixing angle @xmath12 is given by @xmath69 where we have used the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_1 ] ) and @xmath70 . in terms of mixing angles , approximating @xmath71",
    ", we obtain : @xmath72 the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltat12 ] ) was first found in a model of tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing based on so(3 ) flavour symmetry @xcite where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we have shown here that such a result holds quite generally , not just for any model of tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , but also for any model of bimaximal neutrino mixing , or indeed any model of neutrino mixing in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small compared to @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that under these assumptions , the corrections to @xmath12 from the charged lepton sector depend on the charged lepton 1 - 2 mixing _ and _ on the dirac cp phase @xmath5 , a fact which is often overlooked in studies of complementarity , as we now briefly discuss .",
    "the general idea of quark - lepton complementarity @xcite is that the solar mixing predicted from the neutrino sector is corrected by charged lepton contributions , which are in turn related to quark mixing angles .",
    "for example in the case of bimaximal complementarity , the starting point is a maximal solar neutrino angle @xmath75 , and a relation like @xmath76 , compatible with present best - fit values , could in principle emerge .",
    "for example in @xcite it has been shown how a charged lepton mixing @xmath77 , which could nearly realize the qlc relation , can arise in quark - lepton unified theories , and leads to a prediction for @xmath78 which also holds in the presence of cp violating phases . as has been pointed out by many authors ,",
    "an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy with a majorana parity between @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a good starting point for qlc . for @xmath79 and @xmath77 , under the assumptions of sec .",
    "[ sec : specialcase ] which are in general satisfied in approaches to qlc via inverted neutrino mass hierarchy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltat12 ] ) reads @xmath80 in general , we would therefore _ not _ expect a relation such as @xmath76 , where the cabibbo angle enters directly , unless cp is conserved ( i.e.  @xmath81 ) .",
    "all quark - lepton complementarity relations are modified for non - zero @xmath5 and a measurement of the leptonic dirac cp phase is required for testing cabibbo - like corrections to neutrino mixing",
    ".    an interesting application of our general results in the presence of cp violation is to tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "for example , for a charged lepton mixing @xmath82 corresponding to the georgi - jarlskog relation @xcite which arises in many quark - lepton unified theories , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltat12 ] ) leads to a tri - bimaximal complementarity relation @xcite @xmath83 which is consistent with current data for a wide range of cp phases @xmath5 .",
    "this also leads to the prediction @xmath84 .",
    "it is well known that in general , there is no relation between the cp phase @xmath5 observable in neutrino oscillations and the cosmological cp phase which appears in the leptogenesis mechanism @xcite , where the baryon asymmetry of our universe arises via out - of - equilibrium decay of the right - handed neutrinos involved in the see - saw mechanism .",
    "however , for specific classes of flavour models with symmetries or specific assumptions such as texture zeros or sequential dominance conditions , links between these cp violating phases emerge from predictions for the decay asymmetries @xmath85 of the lightest right - handed neutrino .",
    "since @xmath85 depends only on the product @xmath86 @xcite in the mass basis of the right - handed neutrinos , it is not affected by charged lepton mixings and phases at all .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq:13 ] ) immediately shows that links between the mns cp phase @xmath5 and cosmological cp violation relevant for leptogenesis can only hold if @xmath87 , i.e.   if @xmath8 stems mainly from the neutrino sector .",
    "otherwise , there are large contributions to @xmath5 from the charged lepton sector which are completely decoupled from leptogenesis .",
    "if @xmath4 or @xmath1 are much larger than @xmath0 , the lepton mixing @xmath8 and thus also @xmath5 stem dominantly from charged lepton corrections and any leptogenesis - mns link is lost .",
    "in this note , we have revisited charged lepton corrections to neutrino mixing and cp phases , carefully including cp phases from the charged lepton sector .",
    "we have therefore presented simple analytical formulae for including the charged lepton corrections . based on these formulae ,",
    "we have derived interesting new results for small neutrino and charged lepton mixings @xmath88 and @xmath89 : for instance , we have found the relation @xmath90 which connects the prediction from the neutrino sector @xmath27 to the charged lepton mixing @xmath18 and to the dirac cp phase @xmath5 .",
    "we have then applied our formula to the examples of bimaximal or tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing .",
    "one implication was that the so - called quark - lepton complementarity relation @xmath76 can only hold for @xmath7 and it gets modified in the presence of leptonic cp violation .",
    "we have also found that the lepton mixing @xmath8 generated from the charged lepton correction @xmath18 is independent of cp phases and given by @xmath91 combining these results leads to a model - independent sum rule : @xmath92 where @xmath25 in the case of bimaximal neutrino mixing , or @xmath26 in the case of tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , for example .",
