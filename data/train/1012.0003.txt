    "the x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies is primarily thermal in origin and is produced by a diffuse population of intergalactic electrons in the ionized intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "these electrons coexist with a nonthermal , relativistic electron population in at least some clusters  inferred from observations in the radio regime  which should also radiate at x - ray energies .",
    "while thermal emission clearly dominates in the kilo - electron volt ( kev ) energy range , it declines rapidly outside this range , allowing the detection of a nonthermal spectral signature as soft or hard excess emission .",
    "this possibility is especially promising at hard ( @xmath810 kev ) energies , where the exponential decline of the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum is distinctly steeper than the expected nonthermal spectrum .",
    "measurements of nonthermal x - ray emission are critical to the determination of the total amount of relativistic energy in the icm , which is currently poorly constrained . while no more than @xmath910% of this energy is tied up in nonthermal components ,",
    "amounts at or near this level will affect the dynamics and structure of the thermal gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , studies that attempt to infer the total masses of clusters from the hydrostatic state of the thermal gas will produce biased mass estimates if the pressure support of relativistic particles and fields is not accurately included .",
    "the mass functions built from these estimates can be used to constrain cosmological parameters ; these studies are already underway using observables derived in both the x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and microwave ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* through the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) regimes .",
    "a measurement of the total energy in relativistic icm components is possible when x - ray and radio nonthermal fluxes are combined .",
    "diffuse , cluster - wide synchrotron radio emission , called radio halos or relics depending on their morphology , imply that both magnetic fields and relativistic electron populations are present on large scales .",
    "the total luminosity of a synchrotron - emitting electron is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is the lorentz factor of the electron , and @xmath14 is the energy density of the magnetic field . for a collection of relativistic electrons ,",
    "the value of @xmath15 depends both on the number of electrons and on @xmath16 and can not independently determine either . however , these same electrons will up - scatter cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons through inverse compton ( ic ) interactions , which have a luminosity @xmath17 equivalent in form to equation  ( [ eq : lsync ] ) but with @xmath18 replaced by the energy density of the cmb .",
    "since both luminosities are proportional to the number of electrons , their ratio gives the volume - averaged magnetic field , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radiation constant and @xmath21 is the temperature of the cmb .",
    "the ic radiation should be observable at hard x - ray energies @xcite .",
    "thus far , ic emission has only been detected at low significance @xcite or , in one case at higher significance , in the ophiuchus cluster ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite and @xcite ) , although the diffuse radio emission in this cluster is restricted to a smaller scale mini - halo @xcite .",
    "the measurement of an ic flux from a synchrotron source directly leads to a simultaneous determination of the average value of @xmath16 and the relativistic electron density @xcite .",
    "therefore searches for ic emission coincident with a radio halo or relic are an excellent way to constrain the contribution of relativistic materials in clusters .",
    "the first , and brightest , radio halo was discovered by @xcite in the coma cluster , and its radio properties have perhaps been the best studied ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "coma has been observed by all the major observatories with hard x - ray capabilities @xcite , and more recently non - thermal detections have been claimed by @xcite with _ rxte _ and by @xcite with _ bepposax _ , though the latter detection is controversial @xcite . due to the large field of view ( fov ) of these non - imaging instruments and",
    "the simple characterization of the thermal gas , the source of this emission remains uncertain .",
    "even more recently , long ( @xmath22 msec ) observations with _ integral _ have imaged extended diffuse hard x - ray emission from coma , though it was found to be completely consistent with thermal emission @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite performed a joint analysis of spectra from the epic - pn and hxd - pin instruments  the most sensitive instruments at soft and hard energies to date  of the coma cluster and were unable to detect ic emission .",
    "instead , they found an upper limit 2.5 times below the detections of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the narrower fov of the hxd relative to the collimators of the pca / hexte and pds leaves open the possibility that the spatial distribution of ic photons is highly extended , and therefore much of the flux was missed by the hxd .",
    "the ic would have to be much broader than the size of the radio halo .",
    "a uniform ic surface brightness of at least 30  in radius from the cluster center is sufficient to reconcile these results .",
    "therefore , an imaging analysis at hard x - rays is required to confirm this picture ; unfortunately , no focussing hard ( @xmath810 kev ) x - ray telescope has yet been deployed . in the meantime , it is possible to perform a crude imaging analysis with coded mask instruments , as previously discussed by @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we report on the spatial and spectral hard x - ray emission from the coma cluster using the 58month accumulation of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) all - sky survey .",
    "after the first 9 months of the survey , coma was seen to be clearly extended @xcite , so an accurate measurement of its flux must account for its resolved nature ; the standard method of extracting fluxes from coded mask instruments assumes the underlying source to be point - like . using models for the spatial distribution of thermal and potential nonthermal emission , we measure the total , extended flux in the 8 energy bands that make up the survey .",
    "these fluxes are then converted into spectra , which we jointly fit with an epic - pn spectrum from a _ spatially identical region_. in this way , despite poor spatial resolution ( @xmath23 ) , we are sensitive to any large - scale , extended emission above the detection threshold for the survey . while the sensitivity of the bat detector is lower than instruments such as the hxd - pin , the survey s large exposure time ",
    "thanks to a fov that sees @xmath24 of the sky in a single pointing  gives it a comparable , if not superior , overall sensitivity . in section  [ sec : comabat : obs ] , we describe the bat survey in general and the epic - pn and bat observations of the coma cluster specifically .",
    "the extraction of spatially extended fluxes from models , along with the specific models themselves , is discussed in section  [ sec : comabat : spatial ] .",
    "spectra constructed from these spatial fits are presented in section  [ sec : comabat : specfits ] , along with the results of joint fits with the spectrum . in section  [ sec : comabat : uls ] , we provide upper limits on spatially extended , nonthermal emission , and in section  [ sec : comabat : disc ] we discuss the implications of our non - detection for the relativistic phase of the icm of the coma cluster . in the appendices ,",
    "we describe the calibration of the survey such that joint fits with are straightforward , and we demonstrate that the bat instrument intrinsically detects extended emission on the scales of interest here , though with higher uncertainty than for a point source .",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath25 and @xmath26 km / s / mpc and a luminosity distance to coma of 98.4 mpc .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all uncertainties are given at the 90% confidence level .",
    "to achieve the necessary spatial coverage and spectral sensitivity , we take advantage of mosaics of the coma cluster constructed from observations by the and satellites . the high sensitivity and good spectral and spatial resolution of the epic - pn data act as a check on the interpretation of the bat data , allowing the thermal and potentially nonthermal emission at hard energies to be accurately decoupled .",
    "the observations and processed data used herein are identical to that presented in @xcite , where a more detailed description can be found .",
    "the epic - pn mosaic of coma consists of 14 individual pointings , the first set ( 11 pointings ) of which were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the full 14 pointings considered here were first presented in @xcite . for joint",
    "fitting with bat spectra , we extract events from a @xmath27 box centered on the radio halo , which was originally chosen to match the hard x - ray detector field of view ; the region is shown as the outermost contour in figure 3 of @xcite , and also as the box in figure  [ fig : comabat : xmmbat ] in the present paper .",
    "the only modification of our analysis procedure compared to that in @xcite is that the spectra were not weighted by the spatial response of the hxd , since they are not being fit simultaneously with that instrument .",
    "no similar weighting is needed to comparison to the bat data since the bat survey covers the entire sky and the vignetting of individual pointings is corrected for during processing .",
    "we also use the temperature map derived from the mosaic and described in @xcite to model the spatial distribution of hard x - ray emission , which is detailed in section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : models : thermal ] .",
    "spectra extracted within a @xmath28 contiguous grid of regions of size @xmath29 are fit to single temperature apec models over the energy range @xmath30 kev .",
    "while energies of @xmath31 kev are generally included during spectral fits , these data are primarily used to determine the background and are only included as a check of the background subtraction . because of the low count rate at these energies , their inclusion does not significantly contribute to @xmath32 or the resulting best - fit parameters .",
    "while data from the observation of coma ( obsid 801097010 ) are not part of the current analysis , we do make use of the 27.5 kev spectrum from the 0 chip of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis0 ) for calibration purposes , as described in section  [ sec : comabat : cn : xmm ] .",
    "we use the same spectrum that served to cross - calibrate the data in the previous /analysis ( region 10 from * ? ? ?",
    "the mission is primarily to detect and localize gamma - ray bursts , which is accomplished with the very large fov ( @xmath33 of the sky ) , coded mask aperture burst alert telescope ( bat ) . as such",
    ", the nearly random pointing strategy culminates in an almost uniform coverage of the entire sky with an @xmath34 ms of exposure time , made from many @xmath35 minute individual observations .",
    "images of the sky are reconstructed by cross - correlating the shadow pattern of the randomly coded mask in front of the detectors with a detector plane image via a fast fourier transform .",
    "the detectors are sensitive to hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray photons from 14 - 195 kev in 80 native energy channels . as part of the default survey processing , the channels",
    "are combined into 8 broader energy bands : 14 - 20 kev ( e1 ) , 20 - 24 kev ( e2 ) , 24 - 35 kev ( e3 ) , 35 - 50 kev ( e4 ) , 50 - 75 kev ( e5 ) , 75 - 100 kev ( e6 ) , 100 - 150 kev ( e7 ) , and 150 - 195 kev ( e8 ) .",
    "the final survey is built from the individual sky reconstructions , which are summed and resampled onto predetermined image planes of 6 facets , each in the zenith equal area projection .",
    "the detailed processing methodology and survey properties for the 58-month bat all sky survey are nearly identical to those described in @xcite for the 22-month survey .",
    "the only major difference is that for the 58-month survey , the gain of each detector pixel was _ individually _ calibrated with an onboard radioactive source , which had not been done previously .",
    "this better accounts for the sensitivity of low gain pixels , effectively increasing the overall sensitivity . also , the sky images are more finely resampled so that the pixels near the center of the image projection scale @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 as with previous versions of the survey .",
    "the main advantage of this change is to improve the centroiding of sources .    because the systematic uncertainties in the survey - averaged spectrum of the crab nebula are smaller than the uncertainties in the bat survey response matrix , bat survey fluxes are tied to the crab fluxes in each band ( see * ? ?",
    "one drawback to this approach is that a source flux is only guaranteed to be correctly determined if its spectrum within the energy band is identical the crab s ( a power - law with a photon index of @xmath38 ) , since the energy response within the band may not be uniform . because we will fit the bat spectrum jointly with the spectrum ,",
    "it is important that the cross - calibration between the bat and be accurate . since the flux calibration of the bat survey",
    "is based on the crab spectrum , we have made sure that the bat and agree on the flux and spectrum of the crab . the cross - calibration between bat and",
    "is discussed in detail in appendix  [ sec : comabat : cn ] .",
    "the 6 facets of the bat all sky survey are oriented in galactic coordinates with one facet centered on each of the galactic poles and the other 4 centered uniformly around the galactic plane .",
    "the zenith equal area projection conserves surface brightness but not shapes , so objects far from the center of the projection can be somewhat distorted",
    ". however , the fortuitous location of the coma cluster near the north galactic pole , and thus the center of its facet , means that any such distortions are negligible .",
    "nevertheless , for all parts of the analysis image pixels are referred to in terms of their galactic coordinates so that any image projection effects are completely eliminated .",
    "hard x - ray emission is clearly detected in the first 4 energy bands , up to 50 kev . in figure",
    "[ fig : comabat : xmmbat ] , we present the wavelet - smoothed 27 kev epic - pn image of the coma cluster mosaic overlaid with contours of the crab - normalized bat flux ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description ) , which shows the hard x - ray emission to be elongated in the same east - west direction as the softer emission .",
    "as first noted by @xcite in the bat survey , the coma cluster is partially resolved by the bat , which is explicitly shown in figure  [ fig : comabat : comaext ] .",
    "this figure compares the radial surface brightness profile of coma with that of a nearby point source with a comparable flux .",
    "coma is clearly extended .",
    "the points plotted are individual pixels .",
    "the greater width of the distribution for coma indicates that its surface brightness is not circularly symmetric .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : comabat : xmmbat ] , both the bat and x - ray emission is elongated in a ene - wsw direction .",
    "while coded masks instruments have some difficulty detecting extended emission , this is only true for emission extended on very large scales , when the shadow pattern of the mask on the detector plane becomes sufficiently blurred .",
    "conceptually , as long as at least 1 detector pixel is always shadowed by the mask over the entire extent of emission , no flux can be mistaken for the unmodulated background . the random placement of mask elements results in occasional , continuous clumps of over 5 elements across , which means that over a couple degrees all of the source flux can be recovered since one mask element subtends , on average , about 20 . for the bat",
    ", we performed simple simulations that suggest that the actual scale over which accurate extended fluxes can be recovered , _ in principle _",
    ", approaches the size of the fov if the spatial distribution of the source is known _ a priori_.",
    "the practical problem is that flux from each part of an extended source adds systematic noise to every other part of the source , eventually drowning the signal in noise .",
    "however , for small extensions this additional uncertainty is not overwhelming . in appendix  [ sec : comabat : diffuse ] , we show that the bat provides accurate fluxes for extended sources on the scale of interest for the coma cluster ; in particular , fig .  [",
    "fig : comabat : diffsrc_recover ] demonstrates that all of the flux of a source extending over several degrees is accurately recovered .    because nearby pixels in the bat survey images are correlated , it is more difficult to determine the flux uncertainties for extended sources in the bat than is usually the case for x - ray images . for point sources ,",
    "the flux uncertainties can be determined from the fluctuations in the local background in the bat survey images . for coma",
    ", we calculate the rms fluctuations in the background ( @xmath39 ) around coma in an annulus of radius @xmath40 pixels ( @xmath41 ) , as is typically done for sources in the bat survey .",
    "these values , and the flux uncertainties for extended sources like coma , are derived in appendix  [ sec : comabat : err ] .",
    "to extract fluxes for extended sources , we choose to test _ a priori _ model distributions , as opposed to using a method like the `` clean '' algorithm @xcite , which reconstructs fluxes from an unknown underlining distribution assuming the psf shape only .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : comabat : diffuse : tests ] for details about this choice . )",
    "we represent a diffuse source as a collection of point sources , each of which is convolved by the psf ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : comabat : psf ] ) and summed together . throughout this work ,",
    "image data are fit to these spatial models using the mpfit algorithm @xcite , which performs a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization to converge on best - fit parameter values .",
    "our goal is to detect ic emission from the same electrons producing the radio halo ; however , the electron spatial distribution need not follow the radio halo if @xmath16 varies spatially within the icm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , there is evidence that the magnetic field in coma declines with radius @xcite , which would allow for a more extended relativistic electron population visible through ic interactions with cmb photons . to accurately search for this potential signal , we need to both choose model distributions for this emission and to fully model the thermal emission also present in the bat energy bands .",
    "following the success of the -derived temperature map for explaining the thermal origin of the hxd - pin spectrum @xcite , we use the same map to predict the spatial distribution of thermal emission at hard energies . for each region of the map",
    ", the flux of the best - fit apec model is calculated in each bat energy band and treated as a point source at that location .",
    "note that because the apec and mekal look - up tables are not defined above 50 kev in xspec , we use meka to derive the temperature map fluxes in the 4 highest energy bands .",
    "then , for each band the 232 temperature map region `` points '' are taken together to serve as the diffuse model . to compare this or any of our diffuse models to the bat image data , each point",
    "is assigned the psf shape with its peak value equal to the point flux , and the overlapping psfs are summed together and sampled at the location of the image pixels .",
    "thermal emission is detected in the first 4 bat energy bands e1e4 . since this emission is an extension of the x - ray emission which dominates the image and its distribution",
    "is known , we fix the location of the thermal model to the best - fit position of the model for the e1 band data , where the signal - to - noise ratio is the highest .    note that for the thermal model `` fits '' to the bat spatial distribution in various bands , only the normalization of the model in each band is allowed to vary . the spatial distribution within each of the bands is completely determined from the data .",
    "the data will also contain any nonthermal emission within the band .",
    "is it reasonable to use the temperature map and image to determine the spatial distribution of the hard x - ray thermal emission ?",
    "the spectra in the temperature map were fit over the energy range 0.5 kev@xmath42 kev .",
    "while the upper limit of this band is fairly hard , the low energy limit guarantees that the spectra are dominated by softer photons . for any sensible nonthermal spectrum , the spectra are dominated by thermal emission . in fact , if there is cool , dense gas along a given line of sight , the -based model may actually underestimate the thermal hard x - ray emission . in any case , if there is strong nonthermal emission in the spectrum , it will dominate the harder bat energy bands , and will be uncovered in the joint spectral fits to the and bat spectra ( section  [ sec : comabat : specfits ] below ) .",
    "the hxd - pin upper limit , which is 2.5 times below the and detections , only excludes those measurements if the ic emission originates from a relatively compact region ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "more extended emission of roughly uniform surface brightness , however , would be consistent with both the detections and upper limit . in most physical models for the ic ,",
    "it is likely that the surface brightness would decline with radius ; one exception is the kw model discussed below .",
    "however , there is no single well - established model for this decline . since our object is to test the possibility that the difference between our hxd - pin upper limit and the and detections is due to the extent of the ic emission , we consider the extreme case of a uniform surface brightness disk .",
    "thus , we assume any nonthermal emission to take the form of a uniform brightness , circular disk with a radius @xmath44 25  ( r25 ) , 30  ( r30 ) , 35  ( r35 ) , 40  ( r40 ) , 45  ( r45 ) , or 60  ( r60 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed another model for the ic emission of the coma cluster which is consistent with both the hxd - pin upper limit and the and detections . in this model ,",
    "the ic hard x - ray emission comes from a separate population of electrons from those in the radio halo .",
    "this new population of electrons are accelerated at the virial accretion shock of the cluster at a very large radius .",
    "these virial shock accelerated electrons lose energy quickly , and form a shell of hard x - ray emission , which projects on the sky as a ring with nearly uniform surface brightness emission in its interior",
    ". we will refer to this as the kw model .",
    "while most of the flux resides in a ring at the cluster virial radius , the amount of flux detected by an instrument pointed at the cluster center will depend sensitively on its fov .",
    "we take all the model parameter values for coma directly from @xcite when comparing their expected flux to the constraints imposed by the bat data , though the only relevant parameter for the spatial distribution is the accretion shock radius @xmath45 .",
    "the radial distribution of flux is simply geometrical in form , assuming an infinitely thin shell at this radius ; the expression is given in ( * ? ?",
    "* eqn .  9 ) .    in reality ,",
    "it is unlikely the spatial distribution of emission would be as regular and axisymmetric as portrayed by these models .",
    "however , for the spatial extent we consider relative to the resolution of the bat , deviations from the idealized models will not particularly impact our results .",
    "we do not assume that the center of the nonthermal emission distribution from coma is the same as the center of the thermal emission . instead , for each of the nonthermal models ,",
    "the model center is placed at 81 different positions on a @xmath46 grid with @xmath47 spacings around the centroid of the large - scale thermal emission .",
    "the center of the nonthermal emission is taken as one of the parameters to be varied in the fits of the spatial and spectral distributions below .",
    "the spatial models for the thermal emission alone , or for the thermal emission plus nonthermal emission , were fit to the pixel values in the bat images in each of the 8 bat bands . as noted above ( section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : models : thermal ] ) , the center of the thermal model was determined by fitting the center in the e1 band . for the thermal model , only the overall normalization was allowed to vary . for the nonthermal models ,",
    "the center was varied for a grid of positions ( but fixed in each individual fit , see section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : models : nonthermal ] ) .",
    "the model normalization ( i.e. , flux ) in each of the 8 bat bands was fit independently for the thermal and nonthermal models .",
    "that is , the spatial fits made no assumptions about the spectrum of either type of emission .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comabat : batimgs ] , we present the bat images of coma in all 8 energy bands ( first and third columns ) along with the thermal model - subtracted residuals for bands e1e4 ( center column ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the thermal models is represented with the contours in the first column .",
    "note that only positively - valued pixels appear in the grayscale , which has a square - root scaling , and that for each band pure black corresponds to a slightly different value .",
    "each panel covers an identical @xmath48 region of the sky .",
    "residuals from the fits are consistent with background fluctuations , as can also be seen in the radial profiles shown in figure  [ fig : comabat : proffits ] .    as noted above ( section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : models : thermal ] ) , these thermal models are solely based on the temperature map .",
    "that is , the spatial distribution is completely determined from the data , fit over the energy range 0.5 kev@xmath42 kev , and only the total normalization , independently measured in each band , is allowed to vary .",
    "ideally , we would use a harder bandpass to derive the temperature map , especially since it is known that such broad band single temperature fits , when performed on a truly multi - temperature spectrum , produces biased results @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , the lower count rate at energies above 2 kev means that temperatures can not be determined in regions with lower temperature gas or lower flux .",
    "we also extract such a temperature map , using the 212 kev band , and find systematically higher temperatures , @xmath49 % larger than the temperatures in the map we use here . taking this map to represent the input spatial distribution ,",
    "we obtain statistically worse fits to the data , especially in the e1 band .",
    "because cooler , less bright gas in coma s outskirts is not included in this temperature map , though it is present in the bat data , the emission at larger radii can not be properly fit . in any case , the fluxes we derive in each bat band do not significantly depend on the absolute temperatures in the map , since only relative temperature differences across the cluster matter , as the total normalization is independently fit for in each band . because _ all _ the temperatures in the map are increased when a higher energy bandpass is used",
    ", the flux in each bat band remains essentially the same regardless of which temperature map is adopted .",
    "we therefore use the map determined from the 0.5 kev@xmath42 kev band in order to include the cooler gas at larger radius .",
    "regardless , this thermal model provides an adequate description of both the spatial and spectral ( discussed in section  [ sec : comabat : specfits ] below ) properties of the detected emission in the bat data .",
    "this success justifies our approach and confirms that extended emission is detected with the same efficiency as that from the cluster center .",
    "the good fit of the -based thermal model for the emission in bat bands e1e4 and the lack of obvious excess emission in the harder e5e8 bands suggests that nonthermal emission is not very strong or extended .",
    "the nonthermal model with the most extended emission is the kw model @xcite , in which the ic hard x - ray emission comes from a thin shell at a very large radius . following the methodology in section  [ sec : comabat : diffuse : tests ] , we simulate the expected combined thermal and nonthermal flux distribution for this model , and compare to the actual data .",
    "the results for the e1 bat band are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : comabat : thkwprof ] .",
    "clearly , we do not detect the nonthermal emission expected by the model .",
    "the lower panel shows the thermal plus kw model compared to a simulation of the bat data assuming the distribution actually followed this model .",
    "it is clear that the statistics in the bat data would allow us to detect the nonthermal emission from the kw model , were it present .",
    "a more quantitative limit is derived in section  [ sec : comabat : uls ] .",
    "to search for a nonthermal component in the x - ray spectrum of the coma cluster , spectral models are fit to the data .",
    "the fits were done for the bat spectrum alone , or simultaneously with the spectrum of the cluster .",
    "the bat spectra were binned into 8 spectral channels , given by the 8 standard bat bands e1-e8 . to determine the spectrum in each channel ,",
    "the total measured raw photon fluxes in each band were converted into `` true '' photon fluxes using the calibration determined from the bat crab spectrum ; we also create a generic redistribution matrix to better represent models with spectral shapes that differ from the crab ( see section  [ sec : comabat : cn : xmm ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in each channel were determined from the flux uncertainty for a point source @xmath39 ( see section  [ sec : comabat : err : pterr ] ) , and then corrected for the effects of source extent as described in section  [ sec : comabat : err : ext ] , equation  ( [ eq : comabat : differr ] ) , and table  [ tab : comabat : err ] .",
    "the final uncertainty is given by @xmath50 in equation  ( [ eq : comabat : differr ] ) .",
    "additionally , a problem with the implementation of the apec , which we use as our thermal description for spectral fitting , and mekal models in xspec is that the look - up tables are undefined above 50 kev .",
    "therefore , for the 4 energy channels above 50 kev , we substitute meka for apec .",
    "this should have no significant effect given the small thermal flux at these energies relative to the errors .    for the bat",
    "- only spectra , in which only the nonthermal component of the spatial fit is used to build the spectra , a single power law model is sufficient to measure the nonthermal flux .",
    "we also do joint fits of the bat ( containing both the thermal and nonthermal spatial components ) and spectra . in these fits , the excellent statistics at low energies in the spectra",
    "very strongly constrains the thermal emission .",
    "however , the mosaic covers a smaller area compared to either the bat or most of the nonthermal spatial models .",
    "( the extraction region used for this spectral analysis is indicated by the square in figure  [ fig : comabat : xmmbat ] . ) thus , in these fits the models applied to the spectra are reduced by the fraction of the emission in our spectral extraction region .",
    "we first consider a purely thermal model for the x - ray emission in coma , and fit the bat and spectra simultaneously .",
    "the spatial distribution of the emission was assumed to follow the thermal model ( section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : models : thermal ] ) as determined from the data . for these and all following fits ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to energies above 2 kev .",
    "this choice ensures that the thermal component is not strongly biased to lower temperatures by cooler gas in these global , multi - phase spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting single temperature fit is presented in figure  [ fig : comabat : specth ] , and the parameters are given in the first row of table  [ tab : comabat : fits ] .",
    "the quality of the fit is quite good , indicating that a single component description for the temperature structure is sufficient and that the spectra have been reasonably well cross - calibrated .",
    "a slight ascending trend in the e1-e3 residuals exists , however , which is primarily due to a slightly lower than expected e1 flux .",

    "we account for temperature variations in the spatial models used to extract fluxes from the bat images by extrapolating the temperature map from @xcite to higher energies .",
    "this map can also be converted into a spectral model ( labeled `` t@xmath54 '' in table  [ tab : comabat : fits ] ) and compared to the joint spectrum . by including the spatial information of the data in the spectral model , we can better account for the thermal contribution in the bat energy bands .",

    "even so , the bat data are slightly better described by this model than by any of the other spectral models presented .",
    "although this result is perhaps expected , given that the `` t@xmath54 '' spatial distribution is used to measure the bat fluxes , it does indicate that the method is self - consistent .    in all of the thermal models investigated , no evidence for a strong high - temperature component is hinted at by the bat data .        to search for evidence of more centrally located nonthermal emission ,",
    "an ic component was first fit to purely thermally - derived spectra ",
    "i.e. , spectra created from fits to the bat data using only the thermal spatial model  which are reported in rows 4 and 5 of table  [ tab : comabat : fits ] . as in section  [ sec : comabat : specfits : thermal ] , all fits are to the joint -spectrum extracted from the square region in figure  [ fig : comabat : xmmbat ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the thermal model parameters are almost identical to the fits without the ic component , and no significant ic emission is present .",
    "the good single temperature fit to the bat and data already suggests that the nonthermal contribution is not very significant .",
    "if the photon spectral index @xmath71 of the nonthermal component is allowed to vary , it is unconstrained and the best - fitted value is unphysically steep , and in any case , only an upper limit can be placed on the nonthermal flux ( table  [ tab : comabat : fits ] ) .",
    "if we assume a photon index of 2.0 for the nonthermal component based on the radio data ( section  [ sec : comabat : uls ] below ) , the 90% upper limit on the 20 - 80 kev flux is @xmath72 ergs / s/@xmath73 , which corresponds to @xmath74 of the total flux in the range @xmath75 kev .",
    "our goal is to search for extended nonthermal emission , which is measured with spatial model fits to the unlimited fov bat survey images ( section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : fits ] ) .",
    "because the thermal and nonthermal spatial model normalizations are individually and simultaneously allowed to vary to best match the total flux in the bat images , spectra can be created from the sum of both components or separately , and also within any aperture . for each of the 81 grid positions relative to the center of the cluster at which each nonthermal model was fitted for , two spectra are produced .",
    "one consists of the total , unvignetted flux of the nonthermal component only , and the other includes the sum of both the thermal and nonthermal emission inside the extraction region .",
    "the second type of spectrum has the advantage that it can be jointly fit with the epic - pn spectrum , which in the case of a non - detection provides a tighter constraint on the flux of nonthermal emission than the first type , since the nonthermal component must be consistent with the higher quality , lower energy data as well . in none of these cases , for either type of spectrum , is a nonthermal component detected with @xmath76 confidence .",
    "we therefore conclude that , while the bat instrument is certainly sensitive to extended emission , none of a nonthermal origin is observed in the current version of the survey . as an example , the fit parameters for various spectral models are shown in table  [ tab : comabat : fits ] for the spatial model nominally positioned ( i.e.  centered on the large - scale emission ) .    in figure",

    "the bat spectra in figures  [ fig : comabat : specth ] and [ fig : comabat : specul ] are quite similar , indicating that even in the most favorable case the data reject a significant ic contribution to the spectrum of the coma cluster , extended or otherwise .",
    "to ensure appropriate upper limits are derived , we must determine and include any important systematic uncertainties in our results . typically , instrumental and/or cosmic backgrounds",
    "can be a serious concern and must be carefully treated . at lower energies where the thermal emission is bright , the background is not comparable to cluster emission until an energy of @xmath78 kev , so even a background uncertainty of a few percent does not significantly impact the epic - pn spectrum .",
    "this background includes both the non - x - ray and cosmic backgrounds .",
    "given the size of the mosaic , the uncertainty in the overall epic - pn background used here ( @xmath79 - 12 kev ) is 2.4% @xcite . increasing the background favors larger nonthermal fluxes since this reduces the temperature slightly , so the background is raised by 2.4% during upper limit derivations .",
    "point sources in the mosaic account for only @xmath80 of the emission and have a spectrum that as a whole does not vary significantly from a @xmath81 power law @xcite , so we do not model their contribution to the spectrum .",
    "while their flux may artificially enhance a nonthermal signal , ignoring them will only result in slightly more conservative upper limits . for the bat survey data , the background is automatically removed as part of the image reconstruction procedure , and systematic variations",
    "are encoded as fluctuations in empty sky regions , which is already included in the error budget .",
    "the more significant systematic uncertainty is in the determination of the cross - calibration between and .",

    "however , the slope of the calibration ( i.e.  the assumed photon index of the crab ) is less certain . the total error ,",
    "statistical and systematic , of the photon index in epic crab fits is @xmath82 @xcite , so we adjust our calibration to make the canonical crab spectrum flatter by 0.05 , which acts to increase the bat fluxes ( @xmath83 for e1 , @xmath84 for e8 ) and flatten the bat spectra , thus enhancing nonthermal fluxes .",
    "this approach to the systematic uncertainty is also conservative , as it is known that the crab spectrum steepens above 10 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since we have no clear detection of nonthermal emission , we must decide on its photon index from other arguments .",
    "the natural choice is to use the spectral index of the radio halo , or @xmath85",

    "also , both previous detections using and data found @xmath81 , and the model of @xcite predicts this photon index .",
    "therefore , we fix the nonthermal power law index to @xmath77 , primarily because we are most interested in directly comparing our upper limits with these previous detections and model predictions",
    ". if the spectrum of nonthermal emission is in fact flatter , our upper limits will be low by some amount since the bat errors are large and the data will have less leverage on the fits .",

    "stronger constraints are obtained when lower energy emission is simultaneously considered ( top panel ) , and a similar range in upper limits is found for each spatial model distribution .",

    "thermal emission above @xmath910 kev is typically much steeper than the spectral index in equation  ( [ eq : comabat : crab ] ) , so we would prefer to include an approximate redistribution matrix that will handle other such spectral models correctly . to do this ,",
    "we take a standard response matrix for an on - axis source from a single observation and multiply the input energies by a smooth function so that the flux - converted crab spectrum matches equation  ( [ eq : comabat : crab ] ) to @xmath132% in all energy bands .",
    "the addition of this redistribution matrix has a minor effect on spectral fits generally , but it does improve the quality of fits using a thermal model , so we employ it throughout .      with this approach ,",
    "accurate conversions from bat count rates to true fluxes are not guaranteed .",
    "the goal instead is to match the bat calibration with the epic - pn calibration , which ensures that spectral models can be applied seamlessly between the and spectra in joint fits . while fluxes quoted hereafter may differ from their true fluxes , the relative amounts of thermal versus nonthermal emission in the joint spectra  considering both their cross - normalization factor _ and _ shape ",
    "are carefully conserved .",
    "ultimately , because our bat calibration method relies on using the crab as a flux standard , and since the true crab spectrum is not known , the choice of a canonical crab spectrum is at some level arbitrary .",
    "even so , the hard band fluxes derived herein should be consistent with fluxes derived from other missions . using the same power law form as for equation  ( [ eq : comabat : crab ] ) ,",
    "@xcite found a range of normalizations and photon indices for several instruments that overlap with the bat energy bands : pds : @xmath133 ; pca : @xmath134 ; hexte : @xmath135 ; isgri : @xmath136 ; and spi : @xmath137 .",
    "these photon indices agree well with the shape of the total crab spectrum determined by an earlier , detailed balloon - borne study , which found @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "also , the pin fit of @xmath139 is consistent with both the scatter in the above results and our adopted spectrum . ignoring the photon indices derived from data",
    ", there seems to be a steepening in the crab spectrum at higher energies , which means that our relatively flat photon index may over - predict harder band fluxes and thus enhance a potential nonthermal signal .",
    "our crab spectrum also has a slightly higher overall flux ( in the 20 - 80 kev band ) , so that fluxes and upper limits may be biased high , though any such biasing would be well within the absolute calibration uncertainties of all the above missions .    assuming the spi observations are the most accurate , due to its extensive ground calibration",
    ", we can compare our adopted model with the results of @xcite , which show a clear steepening of the crab spectrum above 100 kev . below 100 kev , they find a photon index of 2.07 , consistent with our value of 2.095 .",
    "their best - fit photon index above 100 kev is 2.24 , which would lead our flux calibration to overestimate fluxes in our two highest energy bands .",
    "however , since we detect no flux in these bands , extended or otherwise , even a large erroneous calibration ",
    "which is not the case here  would not bias or otherwise affect our results .",
    "@xcite also fit a smoothly varying power law to their crab spectrum .",
    "not surprisingly , this model is sufficiently similar to our adopted crab spectrum , particularly below 50 kev where the flux calibration is more important , that using it instead of our simple power law model would not lead to quantitatively different results .",
    "very extended , diffuse emission is difficult to detect with coded mask instruments , since the shadow pattern of the mask on the detectors gets smeared out and the signal becomes indiscernible from the background .",
    "however , small scale extended emission is detectable , as long as its size is less than the minimum scale necessary to dilute the distinguishability of the mask pattern . in the following ,",
    "we show that , by simulating extended sources as collections of point sources , this minimum scale is larger than our region of interest and that essentially 100% of the diffuse emission can be detected .      for on - axis sources in the bat fov ,",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) has a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath922 . because the sky image is basically the cross - correlation function of the coded mask with the count rates in the individual detectors , it does not represent the intensity per solid angle ( i.e. within a pixel ) .",
    "instead , a pixel value is proportional to the flux of a point source at that location .",
    "the width of the psf is actually due to oversampling the sky plane , not the scattering of photons inside the instrument , and it depends on the size of individual mask element shadows on the detector relative to the size of detector pixels .    as such ,",
    "the psf should not be summed in order to derive the source flux  this is provided by the central peak value  and its fwhm depends on the off - axis angle of the source .",
    "the distance between the mask and detector increases as the off - axis angle increases , so an angular separation at large off - axis angles produces a more dramatic shift in the shadow pattern across the detector pixels than more on - axis positions , which effectively reduces the oversampling factor and leads to narrower fwhm .",
    "since survey images are created from many `` random '' individual pointings , each with a given source located at a different off - axis angle , the survey psf will have an average fwhm and uniform shape , which is roughly gaussian .",
    "simple gaussian fits to all the @xmath140 sources in all 8 bands yield an average fwhm of @xmath141 , irrespective of s / n or energy band , essentially identical to the value determined in the 22-month survey @xcite .",
    "the psf shape is described by a gaussian to first order , which is not surprising given the non - repeating , randomly filled mask and the many pointings that contribute to the flux at each position .",
    "however , as is clear from the residuals to a gaussian fit to the 1420 kev band crab data and another source ( cyg x-2 ) in figure  [ fig : comabat : psffunc ] , deviations on the order of 1% of the flux exist ( and are significantly larger than the root - mean square ( rms ) of the background in this case ) .",
    "while this deviation does not strongly impact the flux of point sources , since only the maximum , central value maps to the flux , a diffuse source is composed of overlapping psfs , where differences in the wings could affect the overall flux . the residual structure in the wings of the psf is mainly eliminated by the addition of the two - part function : @xmath142 + p_1 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the distance from the center in arcminutes , @xmath144 and @xmath145 are fit parameters ( the normalization and background , respectively ) , @xmath146 ( @xmath147 has units of radians ) , and @xmath148 . the improved fit for the crab",
    "is illustrated in the very bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : comabat : psffunc ] ; while in this case the fit is still not perfect , for other sources the fit is typically better ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : comabat : psffunc ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath144 to be our measurement of the flux . while the maximum of the psf may not exactly correspond to @xmath144 , since all fluxes are determined this way and are also related to the crab fluxes",
    ", any such bias will cancel out during the conversion from bat count rates to fluxes . note that the most the additional terms to @xmath149 could affect a flux , assuming they , for some reason , poorly represented the true psf shape , is at the @xmath150% level .      as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : comabat : spatial ] , we extract fluxes for extended sources by fitting _",
    "a priori _ model distributions , as opposed to using a method like the `` clean '' algorithm @xcite , which reconstructs fluxes from an unknown underlining distribution assuming the psf shape only .",
    "the `` clean '' method requires some fine - tuning , such as the region of extraction ( for clearly detected sources , expanding the region - of - interest even a little beyond the wings of the source can significantly bias the derived flux ) , `` loop gain , '' and completion threshold . in our case , since there are only a few likely spatial distributions for the thermal and any potential nonthermal emission , we are less likely to produce biased fluxes by first assuming a spatial distribution than by using a method like `` clean . ''",
    "we represent a diffuse source as a collection of point sources , each of which is convolved by the psf ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : comabat : psf ] ) and summed together .",
    "we now test whether diffuse sources are detectable over our scales of interest can be evaluated . in general ,",
    "we treat extended emission as a collection of closely - spaced point sources , since existing software is built with these sources in mind .",
    "point sources at any position in the bat fov are straightforward to simulate with the heasoft task batmaskwtimg with the following options set : coord_type = tanxy ; distance=1e7 ; corrections = forward , unbalanced , flatfield ; and rebalance = no .",
    "this task outputs the fraction of each detector pixel which is illuminated by the source given its position relative to the detector axis ; a value of 0.45 means that 55% of the detector area is shadowed by the mask . at this stage",
    ", the detector image can be multiplied by the counts or count rate of the source , and several such detector images representing different sources in the fov can be added together along with a background  all including poisson statistics .",
    "the background can then be fit and subtracted with the task batclean , and finally a reconstructed sky image can be produced via the task batfftimage . for now , to isolate the detectability of diffuse emission by the bat , we simply add uniformly bright , perfectly known point source masks without background or source poisson noise , to create circular , extended disks of various radii @xmath151 . images of the sky are constructed with batfftimage for each disk detector image , and the `` observed '' disk surface brightness profile is fit for as a function of radius .",
    "while even large disks ( @xmath152 ) are visibly noticeable , sky images produced in this way include significant systematic effects induced by the large spatial extent of the emission , leading to high rms noise that eventually destroys the disks detectability .",
    "the recovered surface brightness , relative to the input level , of simulated diffuse disks of radius @xmath151 are presented in figure  [ fig : comabat : diffsrc_recover ] .",
    "error bars represent the simple error of the mean ( @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the number of pixels used to determine @xmath155 ) , and the smooth as opposed to random variation around the input surface brightness results from their systematic nature . for sources in the size range of interest to us , @xmath156 , the _ intrinsic _ uncertainty due to",
    "the telescope design is @xmath157 .",
    "as the disk radius increases , the reconstructed surface brightness becomes less and less robust as there are effectively more sources ( other parts of the disk ) contributing systematic noise to a given location .",
    "note , however , that _ all _ of the input source flux is recovered .",
    "the uncertainty in a given flux measurement is encoded in the rms fluctuations in the local background @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations represent both the statistical fluctuations from shot noise ( dominated by the high background rate ) and systematic error contributions from the sky reconstruction process . due to the large number of individual pointings at nearly random positions ,",
    "most systematic effects nearly average out and lead to a symmetric , nearly gaussian distribution for blank sky regions .",
    "we calculate the rms of the background ( @xmath39 ) around coma in an annulus of radius @xmath40 pixels ( @xmath41 ) , as is typically done for sources in the bat survey .",
    "the values of @xmath39 for each band are given in table  [ tab : comabat : err ] .",
    "while this annulus partially includes the region within which we are searching for a diffuse nonthermal signal , the lack of any obvious emission indicates that the derived errors could not be significantly biased . to ensure @xmath39",
    "is not biased by low level extended flux , we recalculated it inside an annulus of equal area with an inner radius of 90 and found a nearly identical value of @xmath39 in all 8 bands .",
    "the error for a point source , or more correctly the error in the value of a given pixel , presented in section  [ sec : comabat : err : pterr ] does not directly apply to extended sources .",
    "also , we can not take the standard error from spatial @xmath32 fits , using the point source error as the error for the flux in each pixel , because nearby pixels are correlated .",
    "helpfully , the expected error for diffuse sources has already been derived by @xcite for the ibis coded mask instrument onboard . in their appendices",
    ", they derive source fluxes and errors in reconstructed sky images from detector images and find the straightforward result that the error in a flux measurement from an extended source is proportional to its spatial area normalized by the area of the psf function ( * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the area of the source normalized by the psf area . if @xmath160 is the surface brightness of the source convolved with the psf , @xmath161 is its maximum value , @xmath162 is the solid angle , and @xmath163 is the psf , then @xmath164    before we generally apply equation  ( [ eq : comabat : differrarea ] ) to bat data , we test whether this prescription does in fact apply to extended sources in the bat . for each of the diffuse thermal ( section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : models : thermal ] ) or nonthermal ( section  [ sec : comabat : spatial : models : nonthermal ] ) spatial models described above",
    ", we created 121 simulations of the extended source and a number of other point sources in the fov , each with detector counts for the source fluxes and background randomly assigned ( taken from a poisson distribution ) .",
    "each simulated observation is made from a unique position on an @xmath165 grid , with the relative positions of all the sources kept intact .",
    "both the variation of position relative to the telescope axis and the inclusion of point sources are necessary to fully recreate the systematic contribution to the error .",
    "the simulated detector images are then background subtracted and converted into sky images via the procedure outlined in section  [ sec : comabat : diffuse : tests ] .",
    "the total flux of the diffuse sources is chosen so that the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath166 . to check equation  ( [ eq : comabat : differrarea ] ) , fluxes of all the sources",
    "are measured in each simulated sky image , and the average standard deviation of the point source fluxes are compared to the standard deviation of the diffuse source flux .",
    "we find that the estimated errors for the diffuse models ( thermal band e1 , disks r25r60 , and kw ) generally fall below the expected trend with @xmath159 in figure  [ fig : comabat : differr ] .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the number of simulations we were computationally limited to performing ",
    "the distribution of fluxes is only roughly gaussian  or it may represent a true deviation from the results of @xcite . however , to be safe we use equation  ( [ eq : comabat : differr ] ) to calculate the error of fluxes extracted with the corresponding model",
    ".    there is one additional modification to errors on fluxes extracted with our methodology . because we fit a spatial model , convolved by the psf , to the bat image data , the error in the flux is not just the standard deviation of nearby background pixels , but it depends on how the model is fit to all the pixels .",
    "for example , the distribution of normalizations from many fits of a gaussian function to random data of mean zero and standard deviation @xmath39 will not equal @xmath39 but some value @xmath167 depending on the pixel scale .",
    "a delta function , or gaussian of width zero , will produce a distribution consistent with @xmath39 , since this is identical to measuring the standard deviation , but anything wider finds an average over several pixels , and therefore the distribution of normalizations will tend to be closer to the mean of the random pixels . for our purpose , where the normalization is related to the source flux , the correct error of a flux should come from the distribution of model fits to background ( empty ) regions of the survey , which may not be equivalent to @xmath39 .",
    "unlike in the above example , neighboring pixels in the survey are correlated due to oversampling  this is essentially the origin of the psf  and so the standard deviation of model normalizations will be affected by this correlation .",
    "generally , the distribution of normalizations will be larger than @xmath39 in this case , as @xmath32 minimization will be more influenced by the larger fluctuations near the flux extraction region .",
    "the net effect does not significantly change the error distribution shape , but simply inflates the effective standard deviation by some factor , @xmath168 , which is both model - dependent ( varying from 1.4@xmath39 for a point source to 2.24@xmath39 for the model ) and energy dependent since the noise properties vary slightly from band - to - band .",
    "the total flux uncertainty for a diffuse source in the bat survey is adjusted from equation  ( [ eq : comabat : differrarea ] ) to become @xmath169 the precise value of @xmath168 is determined from the standard deviation of fits to 100 blank sky regions , in which we avoid obvious ( @xmath170 ) sources and the galactic plane ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "these factors are reported for each band in table  [ tab : comabat : err ] . not including this factor in the flux error estimate results in spectral fits with unacceptably high @xmath32 values ."
