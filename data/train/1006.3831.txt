    "a detailed understanding of the stellar populations ( sps ) that make up the integrated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of both local and distant galaxies can provide important constraints for models of galaxy formation .",
    "however , confronting observations with sp synthesis models for the purpose of translating the former into physical parameters , is not without significant challenges . while sp modeling has seen tremendous progress over the past decade ( e.g.,bruzual & charlot 2003 , hereafter bc03 ; le  borgne et  al .  2004 ; maraston 2005 , hereafter mar05 ; schiavon 2007 ) , misinterpretations in the data  model comparison are still common .",
    "broadband colors are often used as a proxy for sp parameters .",
    "the well - known age/@xmath2 degeneracy in optical colors is greatly lifted by the addition of nir bands . however , in broadband - based analyses , extinction and reddening effects from interstellar dust can not be ruled out .",
    "indeed , observed optical ",
    "nir colors that lie redward of the model grids , i.e. ,  in a region not supported by a naked sp of any age/@xmath2/sfh , have typically been attributed to dust reddening ( e.g.,peletier et  al .  1999 ; macarthur et  al .",
    "2004 ; carollo et  al .",
    ". meanwhile , red optical  nir colors within the model grids are assumed to result from old and metal - rich sps .    in light of recent implementations of sp models which account for a more detailed treatment of the effects of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stellar evolutionary phase ( e.g.,mar05 ; coelho et  al .  2007 ;",
    "lee et  al .",
    "2009 ) , a reassessment of the observed red optical  nir colors in galaxies is in order .",
    "accounting for the tp - agb is accomplished in mar05 through empirical calibration to lmc globular clusters which have independent age and @xmath2 measurements .",
    "alternatively , synthetic model tracks can be used .",
    "the recent tracks of marigo & girardi ( 2007 ) , whose predictions are in good agreement with those of mar05 , account for nine evolutionary stages ( including the c- , m - type , and superwind mass loss phases ) in the tp - agb .",
    "( note that the older tracks used in the bc03 models account for only a single evolutionary stage for each evolutionary phase in the tp - agb . ) in these models , the tp - agb phase is active in sps of ages @xmath00.32gyr and contributes significantly to the nir flux ( accounting for up to @xmath080% of the nir flux ) , leading to very red optical ",
    "nir colors for this age range .",
    "these models have already been used to resolve the uncomfortably large stellar masses and old ages derived for high-@xmath3 galaxies using models which do not account for all phases in their treatment of the tp - agb phase ( maraston et  al.2006 ) .    in the meantime",
    ", full spectrum fitting techniques have proven to be effective at recovering the underlying stellar content of integrated galaxy spectra ( e.g. ,  heavens et  al .",
    "2000 ; cid  fernandes et  al .  2005 ; walcher et  al .",
    "2006 ; macarthur , gonz ' alez , & courteau 2009 , hereafter mac09 ) .",
    "this type of analysis provides a stochastically - sampled sfh for a given integrated spectrum and allows for true average , as opposed to single sp - based , age and @xmath2 estimates .",
    "full spectral fitting is typically limited to optical wavelengths , as set by the observations .",
    "however , as most models provide seds in the uv  fir range , one can use such model fits to make predictions for the galaxy light in other wavelength regions .",
    "for example , a comparison of predicted versus observed optical ",
    "nir colors could provide valuable insight into both the reliability of the spectral fits as well as any shortcomings of the sp models themselves .",
    "this is precisely the approach we carry out here using our analysis of gemini / gmos long - slit spectra of local spirals ( mac09 ) and new optical imaging for the same galaxies from the palomar observatory and nir imaging from the two micron all sky survey ( hereafter 2mass ; skrutskie et  al .",
    "as we are interested in predictions from models that use different treatments of the tp - agb phase , we focus on two galaxies from our spectroscopic sample ( ngc 628 & ugc 2124 ) with the highest quality data and whose derived sfhs indicate significant contribution ( in @xmath1-band light - weight ) from a 1gyr sp , i.e. ,  where the tp - agb nir signature is expected to be strong .",
    "the long - slit spectroscopic data used for this study , from mac09 , were collected with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; hook et  al .",
    "2004 ) on the 8-m gemini north telescope . the gmos detector and b600 grating combination provides a spatial resolution of 0.072/pix and a dispersion of 0.45 / pix .",
    "the slit field of view ( fov ) of 5@xmath42  provided a boxcar width=10.81resolution .",
    "the spectral coverage spans @xmath040506750 .    optical imaging in the @xmath5 bessel filters",
    "was collected at the palomar 200-inch telescope in 2006 december .",
    "the large format camera consists of a six ccd mosaic with a fov of 6@xmath412  per ccd .",
    "our galaxies have optical diameters @xmath610.5 , leaving enough room beyond the optical radius on a single chip for sky measurements .",
    "typical exposure times were 12 minutes and 2@xmath42 binning gave 0.363/pixel .",
    "the seeing ranged from fwhm=1.83.7 .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using a combination of night - sky and dome flats to carefully account for both the high - frequency spatial sensitivity ( dome ) and the large - scale illumination ( sky ) of the chip . due to the bright - moon conditions , it was necessary to model the background with a surface .",
    "this induced a typical sky error of @xmath00.01mag .",
    "the data were calibrated following the technique of courteau ( 1996 ) using stars from several landolt fields ( landolt 1992 ) , for typical calibration errors of @xmath00.03mag .",
    "imaging in the nir @xmath7 filters were obtained from the 2mass online database .",
    "the background levels were carefully re - measured for each image and the photometric zeropoints were taken from the 2mass headers .",
    "all data ( imaging and spectroscopic ) were corrected for galactic foreground extinction ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .      in order to make a direct comparison between information gleaned from optical spectra versus broadband imaging , we must compare the spectral fits with colors from the same effective radial bins .",
    "as such , rather than the usual azimuthal extraction of sb profiles ( e.g. , , courteau 1996 ; macarthur , courteau , & holtzman 2003 ) , profiles were extracted from all bands ( @xmath8 ) using the same position angle and slit width as for the gmos observations .",
    "we accounted for differences in the observed point spread functions by convolving all profiles ( imaging and spectroscopic ) with the largest fwhm of all observations for each galaxy .",
    "finally , radial binning for both the imaging and spectroscopy was set to the largest measured dispersion , which is that of 2mass ( 1/pixel ) .",
    "the sp fitting technique used here is as described in mac09 ; a brief summary is provided below .",
    "our `` full population synthesis '' technique consists of a bound constrained optimized fit representing the relative contribution of each of the 70 model templates to the observed spectrum .",
    "the only fixed bound is that of no negative template contributions .",
    "the templates are from the bc03 models which provide seds representing simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , i.e.,single bursts of star formation ( sf ) at a given age and @xmath2 , at a resolution of @xmath03  fwhm .",
    "the selected library of 70 ssp templates covers the age range 0.00120gyr and metallicities of @xmath2=0.00040.05 and we use the models with the chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function .",
    "our procedure also allows for dust reddening to the observed sed according to the prescription of charlot & fall ( 2000 ) .",
    "see mac09 for details .",
    "to accommodate any non - stellar contributions to the observed spectrum not considered in the bc03 models , we used an iterative masking scheme whereby deviant @xmath9data ",
    "model@xmath9 points are given zero weight in the fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : fits ] shows the full population synthesis fits to the central spectra of ngc 628 and ugc 2124 ( extracted as described in section  [ sec : extract ] ) , and in figure  [ fig : sfhs ] we plot the inferred sfhs from the fits . in table",
    "[ tab : percent ] , we list for each galaxy the percent - light and mass contributions of `` very young '' ( 0.0010.4gyr ) , `` young '' ( 12gyr ) , `` intermediate '' ( 47gyr ) , and `` old '' ( 1020gyr ) age ssps to the fits .",

    "while their weight in light may not seem dominant , these old populations contribute 74% and 93% to the stellar mass budget of ngc 628 and ugc 2124 , respectively ( table  [ tab : percent ] ) .",
    "however , we are particularly interested here in a significant contribution from ssps that would be expected by the mar05 models to have nir excesses from their treatment of the tp - agb stellar evolution phase .",
    "the age range for which the signature is present is highlighted by the gray shading in figure  [ fig : sfhs ] and referred to as `` young '' in table  [ tab : percent ] .",
    "the contribution to the @xmath1-band normalized light of the young population of interest is 67% and 33% for ngc 628 and ugc 2124 , respectively .",
    "thus , if our sfhs are reliable , according to the mar05 models , these galaxies would be expected to show signs of the tp - agb nir excess .",
    "the full population synthesis fits to the spectra are constrained by the observed 40506750  region ( gray shading in figure  [ fig : seds ] ) and , modulo emission lines , represent this region very well ( see figure  [ fig : fits ] ) .",
    "since the bc03 models cover the range 90160@xmath10 m , we can use the model fits to `` predict '' colors in other bands .",
    "any difference between colors predicted in this fashion and the observed colors can be explained by any of the following scenarios : unrealistic sfhs due to degeneracies in the age/@xmath2/dust plane that can not be constrained with optical data alone ; inadequacy of the template library to represent the full coverage of sp age and @xmath2 in any given integrated spectrum ; unrealistic estimate of the dust extinction from the population synthesis fits ; errors in the sp modeling predictions outside the optical range due to , for example , errors in the stellar evolutionary physics .    to test for any discrepancies ,",
    "we now compare the predicted optical  nir colors from the full population synthesis bc03 model fits to the observed colors .",
    "a direct estimate of the predicted nir excess is complicated by a number of issues related to differences between the bc03 and mar05 models .",
    "first , for a given age and @xmath2 , the model predictions are not identical , even within the optical limits of our spectra .",
    "second , the seds provided in each model do not cover precisely the same age/@xmath2 grid . to illustrate differences between the bc03 and mar05 model seds , we compare in figure  [ fig : seds ] the 1gyr/@xmath2=0.05 ssp from bc03 , which contributes significantly to both sfhs in figure  [ fig : sfhs ] , to the sed closest in age and @xmath2 from the mar05 models ( 1gyr/@xmath2=0.04 ) .",
    "while most of the difference is attributed to the different treatments of the tp - agb phase between bc03 and mar05 , some of it could also be due to the overall larger contribution of agb stars in the mar05 models .",
    "for this comparison , the bc03 models were smoothed with a boxcar of fwhm=20  and resampled to @xmath11=20 / pix to roughly match the resolution and sampling of the mar05 seds .",

    "the blue arrows represent the difference in color between the bc03 1gyr/@xmath2=0.05 ssp and the mar05 1gyr/@xmath2=0.04 ssp .",
    "indeed , the blue vectors represent the data  model difference very well . for ugc 2124 in figure  [",
    "fig : colorcolor2 ] , it appears that a steeper vector would be required to precisely match the data  model difference . in mac09",
    "we demonstrated by a comparison of absorption - line indices that there is evidence of an enhanced [ @xmath15/fe ]  sp in the bulge region of ugc 2124 ( see figure  4 in mac09 ) , which could also affect the observed colors ( only solar - scaled abundance ratio models are considered here ) . to assess whether abundance ratios could compensate for the extra steepness in the data  model difference , we also plot in figure  [ fig : colorcolor2 ] a green vector which represents the effect of a super - solar abundance ratio star at a given t@xmath16/log(g)/@xmath2 from the synthetic stellar models of coelho et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) ( see the figure caption for details ) .",
    "the coelho models do not extend far enough into the nir for an accurate @xmath17-band estimate .",
    "a combined effect of both tp - agb treatment and super - solar [ @xmath15/fe]would be represented by the addition of the two vectors and resulting in a steepening that more closely accounts for the data / model offsets .     and iso - age , respectively , with darker shading indicating higher @xmath2s and older ages ; see middle bottom panels for labels of average age and @xmath2 . * blue arrows : * model prediction differences between the 1gyr/@xmath2=0.05 bc03 ssp ( red dashed curve in figure  [ fig : seds ] ) and the mar05 1gyr/@xmath2=0.04 ssp ( solid blue curve in figure  [ fig : seds ] ) .",

    "again we see a difference between the observations and model predictions , but not in the same sense as the optical  nir colors .",
    "while the @xmath19 color is predicted to be redder in the mar05 models , the @xmath20 and @xmath21 colors are predicted to be bluer . as for the optical ",
    "nir colors , the mar05 models could account for these differences .",
    "the only mismatch is in the @xmath21 versus @xmath19 colors for ugc 2124 , but this could very well be another manifestation of [ @xmath15/fe]-enhanced sps ( whose predictions do not extend far enough to test this ) .    , but for nir colors.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] , but for nir colors.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the above analysis has important implications for the modeling and interpretations of integrated stellar populations .",
    "the full population synthesis fitting of ngc 628 and ugc 2124 indicates the presence of a young component ( @xmath01gyr , where mar05 and bc03 model predictions differ significantly ) contributing @xmath050% to the @xmath1-band flux . in sps models which account for a detailed treatment of all stages of the tp - agb stellar evolution phase ,",
    "this young population would contribute a significant amount of nir flux , resulting in very red optical ",
    "nir colors , a mild reddening in @xmath19 , and a bluing of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 colors .",
    "all of these predicted trends were confirmed with the observed colors , thus providing further support for the presence of the young component , in addition to strongly favoring the contribution of the tp - agb phase used in the mar05 sps models ( as well as the marigo & girardi ( 2007 ) models which agree well with the mar05 predictions ) .",
    "such anomalous colors have been reported before . for a sample of 5800 galaxies from the sdss , eminian et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) compared optical and nir colors with quantities derived from spectra ( star formation rate ( sfr ) , age , @xmath2 , and dust attenuation ) .",
    "they found that galaxies with higher sfrs , while having bluer optical colors ( @xmath22 ) , also had _ redder _ nir colors ( @xmath21 ) , which they interpreted as being in qualitative agreement with the dominance in nir light of the tp - agb phase after a burst of sf .    at higher redshift , ellis ,",
    "abraham , & dickinson ( 2001 ) observed the colors of bulges out to @xmath231 and found that , while many of the bulges had blue optical colors , consistent with recent sf , at @xmath3@xmath240.5 , the same bulges had red observed @xmath19 colors . at these higher redshifts ,",
    "this translates roughly into rest - frame @xmath25 . indeed , while the mar05 models only show a mild reddening compared to those of bc03 of the @xmath19 color ( by @xmath00.1mag for a solar 1gyr ssp ) , the @xmath25 color is much redder ( by @xmath00.7mag ) , thus explaining why the effect is only observed at higher-@xmath3 . while ellis et  al .  attributed the red nir colors to a predominantly `` short burst '' mode of bulge building at high-@xmath3 , the red nir colors",
    "could also be explained by the presence of young sps in the active tp - agb phase .",
    "these results indicate that caution must be taken when interpreting the optical  nir colors of integrated stellar populations .",
    "red colors have typically been interpreted as being due to some combination of old age , high @xmath2 , and significant dust extinction .",
    "however , we have shown here that some of the redness could actually be due to a significant contribution to the sed from a young sp with significant nir flux excess from the tp - agb evolutionary phase .",
    "further confirmation of this result and its implications awaits larger samples and analysis with forthcoming higher - resolution implementations of the sp models which include proper treatment of the tp - agb stellar evolutionary phase .",
