    "@xmath0  cephei is a remarkable star .",
    "after john goodricke recognized its variability in 1784 @xcite , @xmath0  cephei has lent its name to one of the most important classes of variable stars : cepheids . since the discovery of the period ",
    "luminosity ( pl ) relation ( or `` leavitt law '' , @xcite ) , cepheids and their prototype @xmath0  cephei have assumed a fundamental role as the `` first rung '' of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "cepheids are also a crucial benchmark for evolutionary models of intermediate - mass stars in the he - burning phase . despite their importance , however , there are still a number of outstanding puzzles in the theoretical understanding of the stars pulsating like @xmath0  cephei .",
    "the most important issue is the discrepancy between the theoretical and dynamical mass of cepheids .",
    "first noted by @xcite , @xcite and later by @xcite , this issue has been partially solved @xcite with the adoption of modern sets of radiative opacities @xcite .",
    "however , several recent investigations focused on galactic and magellanic clouds cepheids @xcite suggest that such a discrepancy still amounts to 1015% .",
    "for example , according to @xcite the pulsational mass of @xmath0  cephei is @xmath6  m@xmath4 , while the evolutionary mass of the star , based on the period - color - luminosity relations derived by the same authors , can be as high as @xmath7  m@xmath4 .",
    "one possible solution for this problem is mass loss over the lifetime of these stars .",
    "even though commonly used semi - empirical relations @xcite do not predict enough mass loss to account for the cepheids missing mass , these same relations are clearly inadequate to describe the mass loss in red giants ( see e.g. @xcite ) and in globular cluster stars on the horizontal branch @xcite .",
    "these relations may similarly underestimate the mass loss rates in intermediate - mass stars like cepheids .",
    "searches for evidence of current or past mass loss by cepheids and their progenitors have been conducted at different ends of the electromagnetic spectrum . in the ultraviolet ,",
    "@xcite observed a large sample of cepheids with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) satellite , finding mass loss rates ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9  @xmath10  yr@xmath5 . in the far - ir",
    ", @xcite found evidence in the iras photometry @xcite of very cool dust ( @xmath11  k ) around two classical cepheids ( rs  pup and su  cas ) associated with reflection nebulosity .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured mass loss rates of @xmath12@xmath9  @xmath10 yr@xmath5 in a sample of large magellanic cloud cepheids in the mid - ir . in the near - ir , @xmath13 band interferometric observations detected circumstellar shells around nearby classical cepheids @xcite , including @xmath0  cephei . a difference in the absolute distance of @xmath0 cephei",
    "when moving from v , i to v , k bands was also found by @xcite by performing a detailed fit between predicted and observed light , radius , and radial velocity curves .",
    "these detections offer tantalizing evidence in favor of cepheid mass loss , but are not conclusive . in the case of the far - ir excess ,",
    "the large beam of iras ( @xmath14 ) does not allow separation of local dust emission from background `` galactic cirrus '' .",
    "the near - ir shells detected with interferometers have radii as small as @xmath15 stellar radii @xcite , and their origin is not well understood . to resolve these issues ,",
    "we have obtained _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite observations of 29 galactic classical cepheids with the infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) and the multiband infrared photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , @xcite ) .",
    "the results of this investigation are presented in @xcite ( pl and search for mid - ir color excess ) and in @xcite ( search for extended emission ) .    in this paper",
    "we want to focus on @xmath0  cephei . with a distance of 0.273@xmath160.011  kpc @xcite and a fundamental mode period of 5.37  d ,",
    "@xmath0  cephei is the second nearest cepheid to the solar system ( only polaris , a first overtone cepheid , is closer ) .",
    "@xmath0  cephei is also known to be part of a multiple star system .",
    "the b7-b8 iii - v main sequence star , long suspected to be a companion of @xmath0  cephei @xcite shares proper motion with the cepheid @xcite . located 40 ( @xmath17  au ) south of @xmath0  cephei , hd  213307",
    "may itself be a binary star @xcite , with a low mass companion ( @xmath18  @xmath10 , f0 v ) on a circular orbit with a radius of approximately 7  mas ( 1.9  au ) .",
    "the three stars are part of the moving group cep  ob6 @xcite , together with another 18 members that are possibly part of an old ob association .",
    "the earliest spectral type ( b5  iii ) among the stars in the association suggests an age of @xmath19  myr , consistent with the estimated age of @xmath0  cephei ( @xmath20  myr according to the period - age - color relation derived by @xcite , and using @xmath0  cephei colors from @xcite ) . the proximity of @xmath0  cephei to the sun , and the presence of a hot companion which can serve as a `` probe '' of the circumstellar environment of the system , make @xmath0  cephei the ideal test case to search for evidence of cepheids mass loss .",
    "we report on the discovery of extended circumstellar emission around @xmath0  cephei and its companions , detected at irac and mips wavelengths .",
    "this emission appears to be physically associated with @xmath0  cephei , and may be evidence of active mass loss from this star . we detect a 70   arched structure with its axis aligned with the relative proper motion of @xmath0  cephei with respect to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and diffuse and filamentary emission at 5.8 , 8.0 and 24  . in section  [ sec - obs ]",
    "we present our _ spitzer _ observations , while in section  [ sec - nebula ] , [ sec - bowshock ] and [ sec - zoom ] we discuss a possible explanation for the origin and the morphology of the observed structures , and estimate the mass loss rate required for their formation . in section  [ sec - summ ]",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "@xmath0  cephei was observed with irac and mips in cycle-3 , as part of our general observer program with pid  30666 , and in cycle-5 ( irac only ) as part of our guarantee time observer program pid  50350 .",
    "the gto observations were meant to provide a second photometric epoch , and deeper observations aimed at being sensitive to faint circumstellar emission .",
    "the observations were executed on 2006 august 10 ( jd = 2453957.601 ) and 2008 september 23 ( jd = 2454732.832 ) , using the irac full frame mode .",
    "the 2006 observations were obtained with a 5 point gaussian dither pattern in irac `` stellar mode '' , with total integration times of 1.0  sec ( 3.6 and 4.5  ) and 6.0  sec ( 5.8 and 8.0  ) .",
    "the 2008 data were instead acquired with a 36 point reuleaux dither pattern with individual exposures of 1.6  sec integration time each , for a total exposure of 43.2  sec in each band .",
    "the mips observations were obtained on 2007 july 19 ( jd = 2453935.518 ) in the 24 and 70   bands with the photometry astronomical observation template .",
    "the total on - source time was 48.2  sec and 37.7  sec at 24   and 70   respectively .",
    "the irac data were reduced starting from the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) generated by the _ spitzer _",
    "pipeline versions s14.4.0 and s18.7.0 ( 2006 and 2008 datasets respectively ) .",
    "mosaic images with a pixel scale of 0.8627/pix were created using the iracproc post - bcd software @xcite .    in all irac images @xmath0  cephei is saturated and we have determined its photometry using the psf - fitting technique described in @xcite .",
    "the same technique was used to estimate the photometry of hd  213307 in the 2008 dataset , because of column pulldown ( 3.6 and 4.5  ) and banding ( 5.8 and 8.0  ) from the primary star overlapping with the position of the companion , making it impossible to derive accurate aperture photometry .",
    "for the 2006 data the hd  213307 brightness was determined with standard aperture photometry .",
    "the irac magnitudes so derived are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the irac images are shown in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] , with @xmath0  cephei and hd  213307 psf - subtracted .",
    "for the first time , these stars are found to be surrounded by extended infrared emission , brightest at 8.0   and marginally detected at 5.8  .",
    "the emission is diffuse , mostly contained within the dashed arc plotted in the figure , and brighter in the region between the two stars .",
    "the extended infrared emission is on much larger spatial scale ( up to @xmath21 , or @xmath1  au at the @xmath0  cephei distance ) than the circumstellar near - infrared shell detected in the interferometric observations by @xcite with a @xmath15  r@xmath22 @xmath23  au radius .",
    "the surface brightness of the extended emission , measured in the deeper second epoch in the four boxes shown in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] , is listed in table  [ tab : sb ] .",
    "the sky background level has been measured in the two dashed boxes also shown in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] . to take into account",
    "the background offset induced by array muxstriping , we have used sky box _",
    "s1 _ for apertures 1 and 2 , and sky box _",
    "s2 _ for apertures 3 and 4 .",
    "we have corrected the irac surface brightness with their extended source aperture corrections of 0.91 , 0.94 , 0.70 and 0.74 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0   respectively . where no extended emission was detected , we listed the 3@xmath24 limits .",
    "we reduced the mips data using the mips instrument team data analysis tool @xcite .",
    "the processing of the 24   data was straightforward , and the final image is shown in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] . to remove column - like instrument artifacts ,",
    "the 70   data needs to be time filtered with the source region excluded : this operation is complicated in our images because of the narrow field of view , and extended luminosity covering a substantial fraction of the detector . in figure  [ fig:70um ]",
    "we show the resulting filtered images using three different filtering choices .",
    "a _ shows the mosaic without any filtering applied ( leaving the strip pattern noise ) . the center and",
    "right panels show instead the result of excluding the default source point region size ( _ b _ , similar to the default region chosen by the _ spitzer _ science center post - bcd pipeline ) and excluding the whole nebulosity area ( panel _ c _ ) .",
    "the 24   nebulosity is morphologically similar to the one in the irac 8.0   map , and is also mostly contained within the arched envelope plotted in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] , even though there are faint extended lanes at larger spatial scales .",
    "it is also brightest close to @xmath0  cephei and its companion , showing the same structures detected at 8.0  .",
    "the 70   image shows strong extended emission on the n - e side of @xmath0  cephei , stronger along the arched envelope marked in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] .",
    "the detailed morphology of this structure depends on the choice for the filtering exclusion region .",
    "the default choice highlights the high spatial frequencies allowing us to follow the arched structure through the whole width of the array .",
    "the larger exclusion region instead enhances the low spatial frequencies , showing better the faint nebulosity in between the star and the cusps of the arc .",
    "the actual shape of the nebulosity is most likely a combination of the two , but a 70   image with larger field of view would be required to properly filter the map and assess its background emission level .",
    "the 24   and 70   magnitudes of @xmath0  cephei and its companion , derived with standard aperture photometry as described in @xcite , are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . at 70   @xmath0  cephei",
    "is detected with less than 3@xmath24 significance ( @xmath25  mjy , from the default filtered image , which best preserves the point source ) . within the uncertainty ,",
    "the color of the star ( with respect to the simultaneous 24   band ) is zero , indicating absence of significant amount of warm and cold dust near the star ( confirming the results given in @xcite ) .",
    "we have estimated the 24 and 70   surface brightness of the extended emission in the same four boxes shown in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] .",
    "the background level was estimated by averaging the surface brightness values in the two sky boxes , also marked in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] .",
    "the surface brightness is listed in table  [ tab : sb ] .",
    "for the 70   emission , we list the two values corresponding to the different filtering options described above .",
    "with a galactic latitude of @xmath26 , @xmath0  cephei is directly projected against the outer galactic plane , in an area with diffuse infrared - emitting background `` cirrus '' .",
    "inspection of wide field 24 and 70   part of the `` _ spitzer _ mapping of the outer galaxy '' survey ( smog ) , from the _ spitzer _ archive , shows that the diffuse emission centered around @xmath0  cephei is contiguous to a system of larger galactic structures .",
    "understanding if the nebulosity around @xmath0  cephei is physically associated with the star , rather than a chance superposition with background interstellar clouds , is critical to investigate the mass loss history of the star . as part of the _ spitzer _ cycle-5 program pid  50346",
    ", we proposed to obtain a infrared spectrograph ( irs , @xcite ) spectral energy distribution of the @xmath0  cephei extended emission in key areas around the star , to investigate the presence of diagnostic features within the irac and mips bands , and thus identify the nature of the circumstellar matter .",
    "the exhaustion of the spacecraft lhe refrigerant at the end of the cryogenic mission , however , prevented this part of the program from being executed .",
    "program pid  40968 on 2007 december 10 obtained an irs high resolution spectrum centered on @xmath0  cephei .",
    "the data however do not show other emission than the strong photospheric flux .    in absence of spectra for the extended emission , we compared our @xmath0  cephei irac and mips images with the observations of a similar source , for which irs spectra are available .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted the dusty reflection nebula ngc  7023 as an `` analog '' for a cepheid precursor surrounded by circumstellar nebulosity . the central source in this system , the binary star hd  200775 , has a b2ve composite spectral type , similar to the @xmath0  cephei b7 - 8 companion hd  213307 .",
    "with masses of 11 and 9  @xmath10 @xcite , the two stars at the center of ngc  7023 may become cepheids themselves within a few tens of million years . studying",
    "the diffuse emission in ngc  7023 thus offers the chance to probe a system both representative of an early version of @xmath0  cephei , and powered by a central stellar engine similar to the @xmath0  cephei companion .",
    "ngc  7023 was observed with all _ spitzer _ instruments as part of the early release observation programs 717 and 1093 .",
    "the central stars are embedded in a reflection nebula characterized by bright filaments surrounding an hourglass - shaped cavity ( filled with co emission ) probably formed by outflow activity in the hd  200775 past .",
    "the irs spectral energy distribution in a location along one of the bright filaments has been presented and discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have derived the surface brightness of the filaments in all irac and mips images in the same filament location ( position `` a '' in figure  2 of @xcite ) , and listed them in table  [ tab : sb ] .",
    "this location is situated at a distance of @xmath27  au from the central stars ( using a distance of 430  pc for ngc  7023 , according to @xcite ) , similar to the radius of the bright 70   arc in the @xmath0  cephei system .",
    "the availability of the complete infrared spectrum at this location allows us to determine the prevalent mechanisms of emission responsible for the ngc  7023 diffuse luminosity in the irac and mips bands and , by extension , provide diagnostic tools for the unknown emission around @xmath0  cephei .",
    "@xcite showed that the bulk of the flux in the irac bands at 5.8 and 8.0   is due to strong pah and other aromatic emission features .",
    "fainter emission detected at 3.6 and 4.5   is likely related to weaker h@xmath28 lines . the stronger flux in the mips bands , in contrast ,",
    "is associated with thermal emission from very small dust grains ( vsgs ) that are stochastically heated by single uv photons generated by the central b stars .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by comparing the @xmath29 and @xmath30 surface brightness ratio of the filament with models of interstellar dust computed by @xcite .",
    "these models can not be strictly applied because of the different assumption in the spectrum of the input energy field : two b stars in the case of the ngc  7023 nebula and a scaled interstellar radiation field derived for the solar neighborhood by @xcite for the @xcite models .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to note that the flux ratios in the ngc  7023 filament can be reproduced by assuming an irradiation of the nebular material by a field equal to @xmath31 times the interstellar radiation field in the solar neighborhood , and a pah dust fraction @xmath32% .",
    "the surface brightness ratios of the ngc  7023 filament , and of the four locations in the @xmath0  cephei nebula listed in table  [ tab : sb ] are plotted in figure  [ fig : sb ] .",
    "the figure shows that the @xmath0  cephei emission has a @xmath29 significantly smaller than ngc  7023 , suggesting a pah content @xmath33% ( based on @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0  cephei nebula @xmath30 ratio along the 70   arc is as high as @xmath34 times the corresponding ratio for the ngc  7023 filament , suggesting a temperature distribution of the dust grains around the cepheid peaked at higher values .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath30 flux ratio ( and hence the dust temperature ) appears to be loosely correlated with the distance of each box from the two stars in the @xmath0  cephei system . in particular , the flux ratio in box  1 , located on the bright filament in between the two stars , is more than 4 times larger than in the other three boxes : this is strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that the main energy input for the @xmath0  cephei nebula is the two central stars , and thus that the nebula itself is local , and not a background cloud in a chance alignment .",
    "we do not detect any emission at 3.6 and 4.5  .",
    "nevertheless , we can not exclude the presence of shocked h@xmath28 molecules around @xmath0  cephei , since h@xmath28 line emission would be undetected in our images if its @xmath35 and @xmath36 ratios were similar to what we have measured in the ngc  7023 filament .",
    "the envelope of the 70   emission is shaped like a paraboloid centered on @xmath0  cephei and its companion .",
    "structures of this kind are often associated with bow shocks that form due to the interaction of a stellar wind with the surrounding ism ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "bow shocks can be bright in the thermal infrared , when the accumulated interstellar material , or the stellar wind itself , is rich in dust .",
    "examples of these structures around evolved stars abound , including the case of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star r  hya @xcite and the supergiant @xmath37  ori @xcite .",
    "the mira variable class prototype @xmath38  ceti also shows a complex infrared bow shock structure , associated with a uv and infrared - bright `` cometary tail '' that is generated as the star plows at high velocity through its local ism @xcite .",
    "if the far - ir structure surrounding @xmath0  cephei is indeed a bow shock , its axis is expected to be aligned with the direction of the star s motion through the ism .    following the prescription of @xcite ,",
    "we have computed the components of the galactic peculiar space motion of the two stars , @xmath39 .",
    "for these calculations we assumed the following parameters for @xmath0  cephei ( hd  213307 ) : heliocentric radial velocity @xmath40  km  s@xmath5  ( @xmath41  km  s@xmath5 ) from @xcite ; proper motion in right ascension 16.47  mas yr@xmath5 ( 16.48  mas yr@xmath5 ) and proper motion in declination 3.55  mas yr@xmath5 ( 4.70  mas yr@xmath5 ) from the hipparcos database @xcite .",
    "we used the parallax of 3.66  mas ( 3.65  mas ) from @xcite . with the exception of the radial velocity , the values for the two stars are all consistent to within uncertainties .",
    "correction for the solar motion using the constants of @xcite yields @xmath42  km  s@xmath5  for @xmath0  cephei and @xmath43  km  s@xmath5for hd  213307 . projecting back into an equatorial reference frame then gives @xmath44  km  s@xmath5  and @xmath45  km  s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "this implies a space velocity for @xmath0  cephei of @xmath46  km  s@xmath5  along a position angle of 59@xmath47 and a space velocity for hd  213307 of @xmath48  km  s@xmath5  along a position angle of 52@xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] shows that the velocity vector of @xmath0  cephei with respect to the motion of its local ism , is roughly aligned with the symmetry axis of the 70   paraboloid emission .",
    "while this is not a proof that the shape is indeed the result of a bow shock , it strongly suggests that this may be the case .",
    "if a bow shock forms in front of @xmath0  cephei , conservation of momentum implies that the star must be losing mass , in the form of a wind interacting with the ism .",
    "how much dust mass is associated with the 70   emission ? if we assume that the dust is optically thin , we can estimate the total mass of the dust responsible for the 70   emission , following @xcite :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the total flux of the extended emission at 70   in jy , @xmath51 is the distance in kpc , @xmath52",
    "@xmath53  g@xmath5 is the dust opacity from @xcite for a mathis - rumpl - nordsieck dust distribution @xcite , @xmath54 is the planck function in c.g.s units and @xmath55 is the temperature of the dust .    even though , as noted in section  [ sec - nebula ] , the small dust grains responsible for the far - ir emission are most likely stochastically heated , we can still estimate the mode of the grain temperature distribution as the color temperature of the @xmath30 flux ratio .",
    "boxes 2 , 3 and 4 , lying on the 70   bright arc , have color temperature in the range of 85  110  k , comparable with the color temperature of the ngc  7023 filament ( @xmath56  k ) . the color temperature of the dust in box 1 , placed in between @xmath0  cephei and hd  213307 , is however much higher ( @xmath57  k ) , as expected if heated by the radiation from the two close - by stars .",
    "the total 70   flux density of the arched emission , measured in the dotted rectangular annulus in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] is between 1.0 and 2.8  jy , depending on which data reduction product is used .",
    "we used a rectangular aperture to exclude the flux from the marginally detected star . from equation  [ eq : md ] , using the average color temperature @xmath58  k along the arched structure , and @xmath59  jy , we have @xmath60  m@xmath4 .",
    "if we assume a gas to dust mass ratio of @xmath61 , typical of ism and circumstellar dust , we obtain a total mass of gas and dust of @xmath62  m@xmath4 .",
    "a minimum age of this structure is given by the time required by a stellar wind to reach the arc from @xmath0  cephei ( or its companion ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath0  cephei , the wind speed is expected to be comparable to the escape velocity ( @xmath63  km  s@xmath5 ; e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. several times higher than is typical for agb stars .",
    "this implies a minimum age of @xmath64  yr for the structure , and a maximum mass loss rate of @xmath65  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "these value is at the upper end of the cepheids mass loss rates proposed by @xcite .",
    "we can also derive a minimum mass loss rate required to produce the observed bow shock structure using the standard stellar wind / ram pressure balance condition ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath66    here @xmath67 is the standoff distance of the bow shock , @xmath68 is the ambient ism density , @xmath69 is the space velocity of the star relative to the ambient medium , and @xmath70 is the wind outflow velocity . from our _ spitzer",
    "_ images we measure @xmath71  arcmin ( 0.103  pc ) .",
    "we assume that the surrounding medium is pure atomic hydrogen and , from @xcite , a typical particle density in the galactic plane is @xmath72  @xmath73 , implying @xmath74  g  @xmath73 . finally , adopting an expected outflow velocity for the cepheid wind of @xmath75  km  s@xmath5 ( see above ) ,",
    "we find @xmath76  m@xmath77  yr@xmath5 .",
    "while this value can be considered only approximate given the uncertainties in the wind speed for the star and the local ism density , it is nonetheless consistent with the predictions of @xcite for cepheid mass - loss rates ( albeit significantly higher than the @xmath78  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 predicted by @xcite for this star ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath0  cephei sits in a over - dense area of the galactic plane , as the smog and iras maps imply , the ism density ( and thus the minimum @xmath79 ) could be higher .",
    "the fact that the mass - loss rate derived using this approach is one magnitude lower than the estimate computed above , using the observed properties of the dust emission , suggests that part of the bow shock may be comprised of swept up interstellar material rather than entirely shed from the star .",
    "our images in fact do not allow us to determine how much of the detected mass is coming from the star , rather than being swept from the ism by the stellar wind ( see also discussion below on why at least the pah emission detected at 8.0   is likely of interstellar origin ) .",
    "the presence of a bow - shock structure , however , argues in favor of a stellar wind pushing against the ism , and thus at least part of this mass ought to come from the star , with a mass loss rate of at least @xmath80  m@xmath77  yr@xmath5 and up to @xmath81  m@xmath77  yr@xmath5 .",
    "given the high luminosity of the cepheid and its companion , it is fair to ask if the observed dust - free bubble around the stars may be generated by effect of radiation pressure alone , without the need of invoking a cepheid winds .",
    "the radiation pressure has an inverse square law variation and therefore acts like a repulsive `` coulomb '' force .",
    "if an interstellar grain of mass @xmath82 has speed @xmath83  km  s@xmath5 relative to the star , then the distance of closest approach @xmath51 is given by :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the luminosity of the cepheid ( @xmath86  l@xmath4 ) , @xmath87 is the speed of light , @xmath88 is the radius of a grain and @xmath89 is a dimensionless number to express the effective momentum coupling to the geometric cross section . for a spherical grain of radius @xmath88 and density @xmath90  g  @xmath73 ( typical value of astronomical silicates ) :    @xmath91    given that dust grains are opaque at optical and near - ir radiation",
    ", we can assume @xmath92 .",
    "according to equation  [ eq : min - approach ] a distance of closest approach @xmath93  pc is obtained for dust grains with radius @xmath94  .",
    "however , based on the discussion in section  [ sec - nebula ] , the 24 and 70   emission is most likely due to stochastically heated vsgs , that have a typical radius of @xmath95  .",
    "such grains would be blown out by radiation pressure at a distance two order of magnitudes larger than the observed @xmath96  pc .",
    "furthermore , the opening angle of a dust - free bubble created by radiation pressure would be much larger than the one observed : for the direction orthogonal to the space velocity of the star with respect to the ism , the dust grains will have a zero radial component velocity , and will be blown out at a distance much larger than @xmath51 derived from equation  [ eq : min - approach ] , in contrast to the narrow arc observed in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] .",
    "the small size of the emitting grains , and the shape of the arched structure , imply that gas drag is likely to play a strong role in preventing the dust grains from being blown out by the radiation pressure .",
    "while radiation pressure is likely to play some role in the dynamic of the system , we thus still favor the hypothesis that the arched structure is due to a mechanical force acting on both interstellar gas and dust , due to a wind originating from the stars in the system .",
    "detection of emission lines from the shocked material along the arc would confirm that the structure is indeed a bow shock generated by a stellar wind pushing on the ism .",
    "the power @xmath97 in the stellar wind is given by @xmath98 . with @xmath99",
    "km  s@xmath5 and a mass loss rate in the range of @xmath100 to @xmath81  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 , @xmath101 to @xmath102  l@xmath4 .",
    "this energy will likely be dissipated in a radiative shock , and emission lines ( among which h@xmath28 or co ) could be observable .",
    "this was one of the main motivations for our _ spitzer_/irs cycle-5 program , that was unfortunately not executed before the end of the cryogenic mission .",
    "we have plans to attempt the detection of these lines with ground - based near - ir observations ( searching for the @xmath15   h@xmath28 lines ) and possibly with the herschel space telescope as a follow - up of our ot-1 imaging proposal .",
    "l band vla 21  cm observations could also be attempted in search of hi assuming that any structured emission around the star can be successfully disentangled from galactic foreground and background emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : zoom ] shows the 8.0 and 24   emission in the region immediately around @xmath0  cephei and hd  213307 .",
    "this is the area where the diffuse circumstellar emission is stronger at these two wavelength ( box 1 in figure  [ fig : delta_ceph_imgs ] ) , and lowest at 70  , corresponding to a color temperature of @xmath57  k. the figure shows the rather complex morphology of this emission , with a small arched structure that seems to be connecting the two stars , and other filaments arching away from @xmath0  cephei .",
    "can the morphology of this emission be explained in context of the @xmath0  cephei mass loss hypothesis ? in absence of a complete geometry of the region ( in particular , the relative position of the two stars along the line of sight ) and kinematic data for the nebulosity , we can only speculate about the origin of these structures .",
    "one possibility is that the arched structure is in fact a second bow shock , this time associated to hd  213307 . while the structure is not perfectly aligned with the relative motion of hd  213307 with respect to the ism ( but still within the uncertainties ) , it is instructive to evaluate what would be the mass loss rate required for its creation .",
    "the standoff distance of the arc from hd  213307 is in this case @xmath103  arcsec ( 0.034  pc ) , and the escape velocity from hd  213307 ( a b7-b8 main sequence star ) is @xmath104  km  s@xmath5 . using equation  [ eq : bs ] , one obtains a required mass loss rate of @xmath105  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 , more than one order of magnitude smaller than the minimum mass loss rate that we have estimated for @xmath0  cephei .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectation that a late - b star like hd  213307 should not have a strong wind ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as winds drop off strongly in late b stars ( @xcite ; see also eq .",
    "25 in @xcite predicting @xmath106 for a b7 main sequence star with @xmath107  k , @xmath108  l@xmath4 , @xmath109  m@xmath4 , solar metallicity and a galactic value of @xmath110 ) .",
    "the imperfect alignment of the arc with respect to the hd  213307 motion , and the brightening of the arc near @xmath0  cephei could be explained by the interaction of the two stellar winds and with the irradiation of the hd  213307 bow shock from the cepheid photons .",
    "this explanation requires that the distance of the two stars along the line of sight is significantly larger than their distance on the plane of the sky , outside the 3-dimensional paraboloid partially evacuated by the @xmath0  cephei wind .",
    "conversely , if the two stars were on the same plane , a bow shock from hd  213307 would be blown away by a stronger wind from @xmath0  cephei . the uncertainly in the parallax of the two stars is large enough to allow this geometry .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then the possibility that @xmath0  cephei is the origin of a wind responsible for the large , 70   bright , arc is strongly supported , as the weak wind from hd  213307 would not be sufficient to generate a bow shock at the standoff distance of 0.103  pc .",
    "another possibility involves wind mass transfer between @xmath0  cephei and hd  213307 , similar to the structures observed between @xmath38  ceti and its compact companion in the uv @xcite but also in the thermal infrared @xcite .",
    "the much larger separation of @xmath0  cephei from hd  213307 , with respect to the separation of @xmath38  ceti from its companion , makes however this interpretation very unlikely .",
    "an asymmetric mass ejection from @xmath0  cephei , in the chance direction of hd  213307 is also very unlikely because it would require non - radial oscillations with such strength that has never been observed in a cepheid , or strong irradiation of the @xmath0  cephei atmosphere by the hd  213307 photons which is however negligible .",
    "the possibility that the arched structure is in fact originating from the f0  v companion of hd  213307 , being irradiated by the nearby b star , is also to be discounted .",
    "while the flux from hd  213307 contributes to as much as @xmath111% to the photospheric flux of the f0  v companion , a plume from this star ( orbiting hd  213307 with a period of @xmath112  yr , see @xcite ) would generate a tightly wound spiral .",
    "assuming again a wind from hd  213307 as fast as its escape velocity , the spacing in the plume spiral would be @xmath31  au , much smaller than the wide arc observed in the images .",
    "the exact nature of the structures seen in proximity of the two stars is difficult to assess with the available data .",
    "however , the presence of enhanced nebulosity nearest to the two stars is strongly supportive of the hypothesis that the overall structures that we have detected around @xmath0  cephei and its companion are local , rather than a chance alignement with ism background cirrus .",
    "our @xmath0  cephei _ spitzer _ data provides a new and unique view of the recent and current mass loss history of a classical cepheid star .",
    "this system is special , in that the presence of a b spectral type companion provides enough uv photons to excite the circumstellar molecules , making it possible to map them at infrared wavelengths . in the sample of 29 cepheids",
    "observed with _",
    "@xcite , 8 have hot companions , but hd  213307 is significantly hotter than all of the others , with the exception of s  mus that also shows signs of extended emission @xcite .",
    "the question arises as to whether @xmath0  cephei may be unique in having mass loss as the result of the presence of hd  213307 .",
    "the answer is most likely negative , given that the wide separation of the companion is probably too large to affect the mass loss properties of the cepheid .",
    "none of the @xmath0  cephei properties as cepheid ( period , luminosity , or amplitude ) suggest it is unusually likely to have a mass loss episode .",
    "we can then expect the mass - loss properties of @xmath0  cephei to be representative of classical cepheids in general , with the only difference that the presence of hd  213307 and the peculiar motion of @xmath0  cephei with respect to the ism makes any stellar ejecta easier to detect .",
    "the presence of local ( i.e. circumstellar ) structures resembling a bow shock is strong evidence that one or both stars in the system are currently losing mass .",
    "the 70   emission is better aligned with respect to the @xmath0  cephei position and relative proper motion vector ( with respect to the ism ) , although the low resolution and sensitivity at this wavelength is not good enough to rule out alignment with the companion hd  213307 . while the wind responsible for this structure may be arising from either star ( or both ) , the circumstellar shell found by near - ir interferometers @xcite around @xmath0  cephei strongly supports the possibility that the cepheid star is the origin of the wind .",
    "the weak wind expected by a late b star like hd  213307 is also unlikely to be able to form a bow shock with the observed standoff distance of the 70   structure .",
    "an independent confirmation of this expectation could be obtained by showing that the arched filament near the two stars is indeed a secondary bow shock generated by a weak wind coming from hd  213307 .",
    "@xcite found extensive ( @xmath63 to @xmath113  au ) `` warm '' ( @xmath63  k ) emission in spitzer and ground - based mid - ir images of rs  pup and @xmath114  car , which they attributed to dusty mass loss from these stars ( as opposed to cold dust emission , @xmath115  k , in the large massive nebula around rs  pup , attributed to ism material compressed by the cepheid wind ) .",
    "our images suggest that part of the material responsible for the extended emission around @xmath0  cephei is of interstellar origin .",
    "dust grains at @xmath56  k ( the color temperature of the arc ) are too cold to explain the observed @xmath29 ratio . on the other hand , pah emission",
    "as described by @xcite provides a reasonable fit of the data .",
    "given the typical abundances of cepheid atmospheres ( where c / o @xmath116 1 ) , if dust were to form , its composition would largely be characterized by o - rich silicates and not by carbon - based pah . furthermore ,",
    "if indeed @xmath0  cephei ( @xmath117  k ) is currently losing mass , the wind is likely to be atomic and dust free , at least in proximity of the stellar photosphere ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the absence of significant infrared excess we measured close to the star ( see @xcite ) , and the fact that the circumstellar shell found by @xcite would have an equilibrium temperature too high for astrophysical dust survival .",
    "we can conclude that the structures we detect with _ spitzer _ are likely the consequence of the interaction of a @xmath0  cephei wind with the local ism .",
    "the low dust content of this wind near the star implies a different driving mechanism than the dust - driven wind commonly associated to evolved stars . as suggested by @xcite , as an explanation for the shell structures observed with interferometry , it is conceivable that this `` dustless '' wind from @xmath0  cephei is perhaps triggered by the pulsation and shocks crossing the atmosphere .",
    "as it expands , this wind interacts with the ism , leading to the formation of the bow - shock oriented with the proper motion of the cepheid .",
    "the dilution of the ism by the cepheid wind is in agreement with the observed low abundance of pah ( less than one third of the abundance in the ncg  7023 nebula ) . without detailed dynamical data",
    "it is however difficult to accurately determine which fraction of the dust responsible for the strong 24 and 70   emission is of interstellar origin , and how much is condensed in the outflow as it expands and cools .",
    "a star with the evolutionary mass of @xmath0  cephei will stay in the instability strip for a total time @xmath118  myr ( second and third crossing of the strip during the star s blue loop , see @xcite ) .",
    "if mass loss with a rate at the upper limit of our measured range ( @xmath65  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) is sustained through all the cepheid phase , the total mass that could be ejected would be as high as @xmath119  m@xmath4 .",
    "this is @xmath120% of the total current pulsational mass of @xmath0  cephei . while not enough to completely account for the cepheid mass discrepancy , this value may represent a significant portion of it , with possibly more mass lost at the onset of central he - burning ( rg ) phase , before the star crossed the cepheid instability strip . a mass loss rate closer to our lower limit ( @xmath121  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) , however",
    ", would only result in the ejection of a more modest @xmath122  m@xmath4 , or @xmath123% of the current pulsational mass of @xmath0  cephei .",
    "firm constraints on the cepheid mass loss rate will also have a significant impact on the plausibility of the predicted mass - luminosity relation of intermediate - mass stars during central helium burning phases .",
    "far - ir images with higher angular resolution , larger field of view and better sensitivity are required to provide a better estimate of the current @xmath0  cephei mass loss rate , and the contribution of mass loss to solve the cepheids mass discrepancy .",
    "targeted observations with the herschel space telescope , and high sensitivity radio maps in atomic and molecular h and co , may be capable of characterizing the morphology and thermal structure of the large scale emission around this star , thus probing its mass loss history before and during the onset of the cepheid phase .    in summary ,",
    "our spitzer images have detected strong extended nebulosity around @xmath0  cephei and its companion hd  213307 .",
    "this nebulosity is likely to be local , due to mass loss processes from one or both stars .",
    "a large scale far - ir arc , in particular , may be associated with a bow shock generated by the wind of @xmath0  cephei as it moves through the ism .",
    "this is one of the strongest direct evidence to date of cepheid mass loss , and the best available direct measurement of the mass loss rate for a classical cepheid , which we estimate to be in the range of @xmath2 to @xmath81  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",

    "<S> surrounding the two stars , the 5.8 and 8.0   emission is largely attributable to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission swept from the ism by a wind originating from @xmath0  cephei and/or its companion . </S>",
    "<S> stochastically heated small dust grains are the most likely source of the 24 and 70   extended emission . </S>",
    "<S> the 70   emission , in particular , resembles a bow shock aligned in the direction of the proper motion of @xmath0  cephei . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery supports the hypothesis that @xmath0  cephei may be currently losing mass , at a rate in the range @xmath2 to @xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 . </S>"
