    "the standard model ( sm ) has been very successful in describing nature at the weak scale and it is in very good agreement with most of the experimental results .",
    "however depending on some of astrophysical and cosmological observations , many questions remain unanswered such as the nature of the nonbaryonic matter ( dark matter ) , neutrino masses and their mixing , hierarchy problem , and matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "therefore , these limitations lead to the need to introduce additional components to the sm and go beyond its actual framework .",
    "there is no unique way to introduce neutrino masses in the sm .",
    "one of the attractive mechanisms that can explain the smallness of neutrino masses is the radiative mass generation mechanism . in this way , neutrinos are massless at the tree level and get a nonzero mass at the loop level which can be naturally small due to the extra loop suppression factors .",
    "this can be implemented at one loop  @xcite , two loops @xcite , or three loops  @xcite , odd singlet charged @xmath5 , and the rh majorana neutrinos @xmath6 are promoted to triplets @xcite , quintuplet  @xcite , septuplets  @xcite , and in a scale - invariant framework  @xcite .",
    "these models phenomenology have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite and @xcite . ] which can be achieved by extending the sm with new interactions involving additional scalar singlets and/or doublets .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sm was extended with two electrically charged singlet fields under @xmath7 scalars and three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , @xmath6 where a @xmath8 symmetry was imposed to forbid the dirac neutrino mass terms at tree level @xcite .",
    "once the electroweak symmetry is broken , neutrino masses are generated at three loops , and the lightest rh neutrino , @xmath9 , could be a candidate for dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "some generalizations of this model have been proposed where one of the two singlet charged scalars and @xmath6 are replaced by @xmath7 triplet in ref .",
    "@xcite or by @xmath10 quintuplet fields  @xcite .",
    "the scalar spectrum of this model has a pair of charged scalar particles which can be produced at colliders via their couplings to photons and the sm higgs boson .",
    "the signatures of charged scalars at lhc and the future high - energy colliders have been studied by many authors ( see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the main goal of our work is to present the production mechanism of the singlet charged scalar .",
    "moreover , we show that by maximizing the event number excess of the dilepton process @xmath11 at the lhc could be a direct probe of the charged scalar .",
    "we will confront the model parameter space with the neutrino oscillation data and the recent experimental bounds on the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes , such as the upper limit on the @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14@xmath15 provided by the meg collaboration  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we impose appropriate kinematic cuts on the outgoing leptons to optimize the signal in our model over the sm background at the lhc run i and run ii energies .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we present the class of models for neutrino mass where we describe the decay and production of the charged scalar at the lhc for c.m . ( cm )",
    "energies @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of signatures of the charged scalars at the lhc and the significance of the signal as a function of the expected luminosity .",
    "finally , we give our conclusion in sec .",
    "to generate neutrino mass at the loop level , the sm is extended by extra scalars and fermions , among which is a charged scalar , @xmath0 , that transforms under the gauge group @xmath18 as @xmath19 with the following interactions in the lagrangian @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the charged lepton singlet , @xmath23 are the yukawa couplings which are antisymmetric in the generation indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 denotes the charge conjugation operation .",
    "here , @xmath27 represents the sm higgs field doublet , @xmath28 is the scalar potential and @xmath29  could be any additional scalar representation(s ) that is ( are ) required to generate the neutrino mass at loop level .",
    "in such a model , the parameter space must accommodate neutrino masses and mixing and at the same time satisfy the lfv constraints .",
    "also , the charged scalar fields contribute to the higgs decay channel @xmath30 and might lead to an enhancement with respect to the sm , whereas @xmath31 is reduced .",
    "furthermore , a strong first - order electroweak phase transition can be achieved through the coupling of the new scalar degrees of freedom ( i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath29 ) around the electroweak scale to the sm higgs without being in conflict with the recent higgs mass measurements provided by the atlas  @xcite and cm  @xcite collaborations . in some models , when a global symmetry @xmath33 is imposed , there exists a neutral majorana particle that can be a dm candidate .",
    "the collider phenomenology of such kind of models is very rich and , in principle , can be probed through various signals .    the new interactions in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) induce lfv effects via processes such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 and a new contribution to the muon s anomalous magnetic moment:@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath38 is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component in the sm scalar doublet .",
    "the lfv branching ratios should not exceed the experimental upper bounds @xmath39  @xcite and @xmath40  @xcite . according to the lfv experimental constraints , the couplings @xmath41 must scale like @xmath42 , with @xmath43 as a dimensionful constant that depends on each bound .",
    "this means that the couplings @xmath41 are suppressed for low charged scalar mass values .    here , we shall discuss the most striking features of the production mechanism and decay modes of the singlet charged scalars that can be manifested at the large hadron collider .",
    "this extends our earlier studies  @xcite at the future @xmath44 colliders such as the international linear collider by including more accurate signatures for any possible charged scalars production . in our analysis , we take @xmath45 to be within the range @xmath46 $ ] and select the parameter space to be in agreement with the lfv bounds @xcite .    in proton - proton collisions , the charged scalars @xmath0 can be produced in pairs through the processes : @xmath47 which are depicted in fig .",
    "however , the contribution of the quark - antiquark higgs - mediated annihilation process is highly suppressed by the small yukawa coupling of the light quarks .",

    "iii , we choose a benchmark point and investigate in detail the possibility of having a significant excess in the process @xmath68 . such excess will be a direct proof of the effect of the charged scalars .",
    "in this section , we discuss one of the important tests of this class of neutrino mass models ( [ l ] ) which can be explored at the lhc tev energies .",
    "hereafter , we consider one benchmark with the following parameters values@xmath69{l}f_{e\\mu}=-(4.97+i1.41)\\times10^{-2},\\quad f_{e\\tau}=0.106+i0.0859,\\\\ f_{\\mu\\tau}=(3.04-i4.72)\\times10^{-6},\\quad\\quad m_{s}=914.2\\text { \\textrm{gev.}}\\end{array } \\right .   \\label{fm}\\ ] ]    these considered parameters values are in agreement with lfv bounds and could be part of a benchmark point in such a model in which the neutrino oscillation data and dm relic density can be easily addressed",
    ". the signature of a charged scalar at the lhc will be identified through the detection of two opposite - sign charged leptons plus missing energy corresponding to the sm neutrinos .",
    "therefore , the final state consists of requiring dileptons plus missing energy which will define the event topology of the signal , @xmath70 where @xmath71 can be @xmath72@xmath73 , @xmath73@xmath74 , or @xmath75 @xmath74 , except the @xmath76 leptons which are very difficult to identify experimentally .",

    "searches for a typical signal including new charged scalars @xmath0 through kinematic distributions in events with dilepton final states have not yet found yet any significant deviation from the sm as has been illustrated by atlas @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the dominant source of background is defined as being any process where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , or @xmath83 are intermediate states : @xmath84    according to the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , the same final state can be achieved through intermediate states that include a single or a pair of charged scalars .",
    "thereby , in this work , we are looking for any deviation from the sm where the effective cross section in question is the difference between the cross section estimated according to eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) and the one estimated within the sm .",
    "thus , when finding the different cuts , we consider the values of kinematic variables for which the effective differential cross section is strictly positive .    in this work ,",
    "the model files were produced using the lanhep program  @xcite for the feynman rules generation in momentum representation . then the event generation and simulation for the corresponding cross sections of both signal and background processes at various c.m .",

    "as can be seen , for the sm case , the two processes @xmath88 and @xmath89 have the same cross section values , while in our model it shows an increasing difference with respect to the c.m . energy values .",
    "this can be understood due to the fact that the charged scalar couplings to the leptons are not universal .",
    "therefore , it is possible to test these interactions when more data are accumulated at the lhc run ii .",
    "the criteria used to reject the background are based on the full kinematic study of the events .",
    "for that , we have examined the kinematic distributions of the signal and background to define a convenient set of cuts that can provide a good discrimination against the reducible background .    to optimize the signal significance ,",
    "the event selection is performed in two steps : an initial _ preselection _ and _ final selection_. in the preselection we use an accurate cut on the @xmath3 event variable@xcite to separate as much as possible the signal from the sm background without a large reduction in the signal efficiency .",
    "this is applied by imposing an inclusive cut on @xmath3 defined as @xmath90   , \\label{mt2var}\\ ] ] with@xmath91 where @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) are the energy and transverse momentum energy of the charged lepton ( neutrino ) .",
