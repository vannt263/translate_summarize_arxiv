    "studies on the reaction @xmath0 close to threshold have been motivated by the continuing discussion on the nature of the scalar resonances @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite . within the jlich meson exchange model the @xmath8 interaction gives",
    "rise to a bound state in the isoscalar sector identified with the @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "both shape and absolute scale of @xmath9 transitions crucially depend on the strength of the @xmath8 interaction , which in turn is a prerequisite of a @xmath8 molecule interpretation of the @xmath6 .",
    "similar effects might be expected in proton  proton scattering , and first results of exploratory microscopic calculations have recently been presented  @xcite .    a first total cross section value for the elementary antikaon production below the @xmath5 threshold in proton  proton scattering has been extracted from exclusive data taken at the cosy11 installation at an excess energy of @xmath10 with @xmath11 including statistical and systematical errors , respectively  @xcite . the experimental technique is based on the measurement of the complete four  momenta of positively charged ejectiles .",
    "requiring furthermore a @xmath12 consistent hit in the dedicated negative particle detection system of the cosy11 facility  @xcite , the identification of the four particle final state becomes ( almost ) completely free of background ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kkresult ] ) .    -4ex    -4ex    however , the presently available statistics of @xmath13 events is not sufficient to distinguish non  resonant @xmath13 production and resonant production via the scalar resonances @xmath6 and @xmath7 from differential observables , e.g.  the @xmath8 invariant mass distribution .    considering",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 production indicate strong imprints of final state interaction ( fsi ) at excess energies @xmath17 in the proton  proton and , in case of @xmath14 , in the proton  meson subsystems .",
    "contrary to this , @xmath0 cross section data obtained at cosy11  @xcite and disto  @xcite below and above the @xmath5 threshold , respectively , are in reasonable agreement with one  boson exchange calculations  @xcite neglecting fsi effects . presently it is not clear whether the absence of the fsi influence in the @xmath0 reaction might be explained by a partial compensation of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 interaction in the final state or by the additional degree of freedom given by the four  body final state .",
    "in the latter case fsi effects are expected to be more pronounced at energies very close to the @xmath13 production threshold  @xcite .",
    "data taking at excess energies closer to threshold and slightly below the @xmath20 production threshold , i.e.  at excess energies of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with respect to the @xmath13 threshold , has been successfully completed early this year at the cosy11 facility and data analysis is presently in progress .",
    "the most striking feature of the exclusive close  to  threshold data on @xmath23 and @xmath3 production in proton  proton scattering taken at the cosy11 facility  @xcite is the @xmath3 suppression with @xmath24 observed at equal excess energies below @xmath25 . at excess energies",
    "@xmath26 this ratio is known to be about 2.5  @xcite .",
    "inclusive @xmath27 production data in @xmath18 scattering from the spes  4 facility at an excess energy of @xmath28 with respect to the @xmath29 threshold show enhancements at the @xmath30 and @xmath31 thresholds of similar magnitude  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , a strong @xmath32 final state conversion might account for both the inclusive saturne results as well as the @xmath3 depletion in the cosy11 data .",
    "evidence for such conversion effects is known e.g.  from exclusive hyperon data via @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "however , in exploratory calculations performed within the framework of the jlich meson exchange model  @xcite , taking into account both @xmath34 and @xmath35 exchange diagrams in a coupled channel approach , a final state conversion is rather excluded as origin of the experimentally observed ratio .",
    "while @xmath23 production is found to be dominated by kaon exchange both @xmath34 and @xmath35 exchange turn out to contribute to the @xmath3 channel with similar strength .",
    "it is concluded  @xcite , that a destructive interference of @xmath34 and @xmath35 exchange might explain the close  to  threshold @xmath3 suppression .",
    "an experimental study of @xmath36 production in different isospin configurations should provide a crucial test for the above interpretation , as for the reaction @xmath37 an opposite interference pattern is found as compared to the @xmath38 channel .",
    "measurements close to threshold are planned at the cosy11 facility in the near future .",
    "contributions from direct production as well as heavy meson exchanges have been neglected so far in these calculations  @xcite but might influence the @xmath2 production ratio  @xcite . for complementary theoretical studies  considering strangeness production close to threshold to proceed by one  boson exchanges or one  boson exchange followed by the excitation of nucleon resonances  we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and a recent review  @xcite .",
    "measurements on the @xmath2 production ratio in proton  proton collisions have been extended up to excess energies of @xmath39 at the cosy11 installation  @xcite . in comparison to the experimental data , in figure  [ fig : lsratio ] calculations",
    "are included obtained within the approach of  @xcite assuming a destructive interference of @xmath34 and @xmath35 exchange with different choices of the microscopic hyperon nucleon model to describe the interaction in the final state  @xcite .",
    "the result depends on the details  especially the off  shell properties  of the hyperon ",
    "nucleon interaction employed . at the present stage",
    "both the good agreement found in  @xcite for jlich model  a  @xcite with the close  to  threshold result and for the nijmegen model ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsratio ] ) with the energy dependence of the cross section ratio should rather be regarded as accidental @xmath31 channel had to be introduced  @xcite resulting in an ambiguity for the @xmath40 amplitude  @xcite . ] .",
    "calculations using the new jlich model ( solid line in fig .  [ fig : lsratio ]  @xcite ) do not reproduce the tendency of the experimental data . it is suggested in  @xcite that neglecting the energy dependence of the elementary amplitudes and higher partial waves might no longer be justified beyond excess energies of @xmath41 .",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section for @xmath23 production up to excess energies of @xmath39 is much better described by a phase space behaviour modified by the @xmath42 final state interaction than by pure phase space  @xcite . however , unlike the findings of  @xcite based on data up to @xmath25 , in the energy range up to @xmath4 @xmath3 production is equally well described neglecting any fsi effect .",
    "one reason for this qualitatively different behaviour might be , that the @xmath40 fsi is much weaker compared to the @xmath23proton system . on the other hand , a fit to the energy dependence based on a phase space behaviour implies dominant s  wave production and energy independent reaction dynamics as discussed above . within the statistics of the present experiment , p  wave contributions can be neither ruled out nor confirmed at higher excess energies for @xmath3 production .",
    "consequently , high statistics @xmath3 data would be needed in future to study the onset of different partial waves experimentally",
