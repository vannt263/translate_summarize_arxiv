    "quantum protocols are mostly designed in the idealistic situation of a decoherence free system . in practical implementation of these protocols",
    "the external environment can play a significant role in reducing the fidelity of the expected outcomes .",
    "the various environmental interactions of the quantum system are dealt using either a harmonic oscillator bath or a spin bath @xcite . at low enough temperatures where only a few energy modes of environmental constituents contribute to the dynamics , modeling the bath by a set of spins ( finite dimensional ) seems to be a more natural choice @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it was shown that spin environments always lead to non - markovian decoherence of the quantum system , where the decoherence time scales and saturation value of qubit polarization will depend on the initial polarizations of the both the system and bath spins @xcite .",
    "this dependence can have considerable effect on quantum protocols , we shall discuss one such situation later in this paper .    in implementing quantum teleportation @xcite , bob gets the same unknown state after a proper unitary transformation irrespective of the bell state measurement made by alice .",
    "the same may not be true in presence of environmental interaction both at the transmitting and the receiving station .",
    "most of the recent work has been devoted in studying the effect of local noises for both the alice and bob s qubit @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that alice is in possession of two qubits where as bob has only one .",
    "hence the decoherence at the transmitting station can be quite different from that of the receiving station .",
    "if the qubits of alice see different environments , there is nothing new to the dynamics as bob gets the same decohered state irrespective of the bell state shared with alice . on the other hand",
    "if both the qubits of alice see a common environment the situation will be quite different , as there will be bath mediated interaction between the two .",
    "this can lead to the bath induced entanglement between alice s qubits . as the common environment for alice s qubits seems to be a more natural choice to study the effects of decoherence on teleportation , the present study aim at explicating such effects through an exactly solvable model described below .",
    "the problem of common bath decoherence becomes more relevant in cases where alice and bob share @xmath0 qubit entangled state with @xmath1 qubits at alice possession and @xmath2 with bob @xcite .",
    "the present work can be a starting point for all such generalized studies      in this paper we shall consider the central spin model to study the effect of spin bath on the qubits used for teleportation .",
    "this model can be more realistic in quantum dot systems where the dominant contribution to decoherence comes from the nuclear spins interacting through the homogeneous heisenberg interaction with the system spins .",
    "recently it was shown how quantum dots can be used as a resource for teleportation @xcite .",
    "the present study can also be relevant for other solid state systems using spins as qubits .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the qubits and the spin bath is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , represents the spin operators of the two qubits at the transmitting site which are in possession of alice and @xmath5 the spin operator of bob s qubit .",
    "the total spin of the environmental particles seen by each qubit is represented by @xmath6 .",
    "the interaction strengths of the qubits with their respective baths are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "depending on the common set of environmental spins seen by alice s qubits , one has either a common spin bath or separate baths .",
    "the decoherence at bob s site is trivial since bob has only qubit , we set @xmath10 .",
    "the interest is on the transmitting side as there are two qubits .",
    "it is well known from the earlier studies that a common bath can induce entanglement between two initially unentangled qubits @xcite .",
    "the common bath interaction between the qubits can lead to a natural selection of two - qubit states which are less prone to decoherence @xcite .",
    "hence all these effects can show considerable effect on the fidelity of the transmitted state .    in this work",
    "we shall restrict ourselves completely to the density matrix notation . writing the qubit",
    "states explicitly in terms of the polarizations and correlations helps us understand the underlying physical structure in a straight forward manner .",
    "the most general representation of a two - qubit bell state is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spin operators of the qubits @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the correlation vector @xmath16 . for the bell states the corresponding correlation vectors are given by @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 $ ] , and @xmath20 $ ] .",

    "it can be immediately seen that one of them belongs to the singlet sector and the other three to the triplet sector .",
    "when evolving through hamiltonian dynamics each of them respond differently to the environmental interaction and to the applied fields .      using the bell - state representation given above the initial state used in the teleportation protocol",
    "is given by @xmath26\\otimes \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\hat{\\mathcal{i } } + 4\\sum_k d_k s^k_as^k_b \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the polarization vector of the unknown state which is to be teleported to bob .",

    "performing the appropriate unitary transformation is equivalent to multiplying @xmath40 to @xmath41 in eq.[dfbpol ] . since @xmath42",
    "we immediately see that the final state that of bob is the unknown state that alice wishes to teleport i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "thus we have given a more general description of the teleportation scheme where bob s operation has a physical meaning in terms of the plane chosen by the correlation vectors of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 entangled states .",
    "we shall show later that the above representation helps in dealing with the time - evolution of the qubits in the presence of environment more easily .",
    "in this section we shall study the effects of a common bath decoherence for alice s qubits on fidelity of the teleported state .",
    "the hamiltonian given in eq.[ham ] reduces to @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the total bath spin .",
    "note that eventhough there is no direct interaction between alice s qubits , their interaction with the bath can result in an indirect coupling between the two .",
    "this will lead to the generation of entanglement between alice s qubits prior to her measurement .",
    "we shall take the initial state of the bath as an incoherent superposition of states labelled by the bath spin @xmath48 , with weights @xmath49 , @xmath50 . in this study all @xmath51",
    "will be taken to be unpolarized ( multiple of identity ) .",

    "the final state of bob is then given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 . if system bath interaction is zero i.e. , @xmath67 then @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and we get perfect teleportation . in the presence of the bath bob s",

    "for completely unpolarized baths",
    "i.e. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is number of bath spins .    for bell states",
    "@xmath89 has only two values , @xmath90 .",
    "if the state is singlet then @xmath91 and for the remaining bell states it has the value one .",
    "the average fidelity has an initial gaussian decay , @xmath92 , with two different decoherence time scales depending on the bell state measurement made by alice , given by @xmath93 the bell states @xmath94 are defined earlier in sec - ia .",
    "when the couplings are identical i.e. , @xmath81 , @xmath95 and hence the singlet measurement on alice s qubits does not harm the state teleported to bob . on the other hand",
    "if the sign of @xmath96 becomes negative i.e. , if one of alice s qubit is interacting ferromagnetically with the bath and the other antiferromagnetically , then singlet measurement would give a highly decohered state to bob in comparison to the other bell measurements .",
    "thus the sign of the interaction with the bath can decide which particular measurement of alice can give bob a less decohered state .",
    "in fig.1 we have plotted average fidelity as a function of time for @xmath97 .",
    "contrast to the case of @xmath98 , where singlet measurements are preferred to triplet measurements , @xmath99 prefers triplet measurement to singlet measurement .",
    "thus depending on the nature of interaction of alice s qubits with the bath , various measurements can be distinguished .",
    "it was shown earlier by rao _",
    "et al._@xcite , that the singlet state in not the least decohered state for all @xmath96 .",
    "one can find values of @xmath96 , where non - maximally entangled states have larger decoherence time scale in comparison to the maximally entangled states .",
    "hence the natural question would be to know whether measurement on the partial entangled basis by alice can improve the average fidelity given in eq.[avfid ] . in the next section we shall take up the task of evaluating the average fidelity of teleportation when alice measures her two - qubits in the non - maximally entangled basis .",
    "similar to the analysis done in the earlier section , we find the average fidelity of the teleported state after the four measurements to be @xmath103,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{f}^{t^r_0}_{av}(t ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{(1+r)^2 + 2r}{6(1+r^2)}\\left[1-\\frac{t^2}{\\tau^2_0}\\left(1+\\frac{\\delta(1+r^2)}{(1+r)^2 + 2r}\\right)\\right],\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{f}^{t^r_\\pm}_{av}(t ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{(1+r)^2 + 2r}{6(1+r^2)}\\left[1-\\frac{t^2}{\\tau^2_0}\\left(1+\\frac{2\\delta r}{(1+r)^2 + 2r}\\right)\\right],\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath105 , the form of above equations reduce to that obtained in the earlier section .",
    "because of the fraction @xmath106 appearing in the above expressions the average fidelity of teleportation in the case of partial entangled measurement is always less than the bell - state measurement i.,e @xmath107 and similarly for all other bell - states .",
    "in contrast to the earlier case where all the three bell - states belonging to the triplet sector gave the same average fidelity , we find that they get further distinguished with @xmath108 giving one value of @xmath109 and @xmath110 different .",
    "this difference is because of the trace of the correlation matrix being different for these states for @xmath111 .",
    "though partially entangled states have long decoherence time - scales in comparison to maximally entangled states in some range of @xmath96 , teleportation always prefers bell - basis measurement , if alice and bob initially share a maximally entangled state .",
    "the individual polarizations of qubits @xmath112 and @xmath113 though non - zero , did not contribute to @xmath109 because of the averaging performed on the surface of bloch sphere .",
    ", where @xmath114 , and in the state @xmath115 the first index corresponds to the spin value and the second value corresponds to the @xmath21 component of the spin .",
    "the bath is composed of @xmath73 spins and @xmath74 .",
    ", width=302 ]      in the earlier section we have considered the bath to be completely unpolarized , i.e. , there is no preferred direction from the bath and hence all the unknown states with a given purity can be teleported with equal fidelity .",
    "in contrast if the bath is polarized there will be a preferred direction chosen by the bath because of which the fidelity of various state which alice wishes to teleport can be different .",
    "a detailed analytical analysis for the polarized baths as done for the case of unpolarized baths is quite difficult .",
    "instead , we have shown the effects of initial bath state on the short and long time behaviour of fidelity of different unknown states numerically .",
    "in fig.2 we have plotted @xmath116 for two different unknown states , when the bath is polarized along @xmath21 direction .",
    "it can be seen from fig.2 that when the polarization of the unknown state is perpendicular to the polarization direction of the bath , both the decoherence time scale and the saturation value of @xmath116 are large in comparison to the situation where the polarization of the unknown state is parallel to the bath direction . in one case",
    "the fidelity is always great that the limiting value @xmath117 , where as for the other case @xmath116 becomes smaller than @xmath117 in certain time regime but finally saturates close to the limiting value .",
    "it was shown earlier by many authors ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) that the polarization of the bath helps reduce the qubit decoherence . in the case of quantum dots",
    "a bath polarization of @xmath118 has been achieved experimentally @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from fig.2 , that in the presence of polarized baths teleportation of all unknown states can not be done under the same footing .",
    "instead , one has to narrow down to some specialised states ( which may belong to certain regions of the bloch sphere ) thereby reducing the unknowness of the state being teleported . if a third party ( an eavesdropper ) has control over the bath polarizations , and by knowing that the state has been teleported faithfully to bob he can approximately estimate the unknown state .",
    "this can be quite harmful for the secure communication which the quantum teleportation promises .    in conclusion",
    "we have studied the average fidelity for teleporting an unknown state to bob , when alice s qubits see a common environment . because of the common interaction with the bath , the average fidelity varies with the bell state measurement performed by alice . even after bob s operation",
    ", the state still has the information of alice s measurement .",
    "this feature can not be seen both in the decoherence free teleportation and teleportation through local noisy channels ( separate baths ) .",
    "the singlet measurement always gives bob the unknown state with high fidelity only when both the qubits of alice interact either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically with bath .",
    "in contrast if one of the alice s qubits interact ferromagnetically and the other anti - ferromagnetically then measurement of bell states belonging to the triplet sector will give better fidelity . instead of bell measurement",
    "if alice performs measurement on partially entangled basis , then the measurement further distinguishes the states , but the fidelity is smaller than obtained from bell measurement .",
    "the common bath is responsible for an indirect interaction between the qubits of alice .",
    "eventhough not shown here there will be a generation of entanglement ( bath induced entanglement ) between the initially uncorrelated qubits of alice , because of the effective exchange interaction between the qubits induced by the bath .        14 by h. p. breuer and f. petruccione , ( oxford university press , london 2002 ) n v prokofev and p c e stamp , rep .",
