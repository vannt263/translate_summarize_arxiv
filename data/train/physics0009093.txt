    "waves experience moving media as effective gravitational fields . to understand why ,",
    "imagine a definite example  light traveling in a moving transparent fluid such as flowing water @xcite . in each drop of the liquid ,",
    "light propagates along a straight line and so each drop distinguishes a particular inertial frame .",
    "now imagine light passing from one drop to a next one which happens to move with a different velocity vector .",
    "again , the new drop in the way of the light distinguishes an inertial frame , but this new frame will differ from the previous one .",
    "light traveling in a non  uniformly moving medium is constantly forced to adapt to new inertial frames .",
    "an analogous situation occurs in curved space ",
    "time when light , and all other matter , experiences space and time as consisting of connected inertial frames .",
    "time can be thought as being locally flat , even in the vicinity of the most violent gravitating objects , yet each local frame is non - trivially connected to the neighboring frames , a connection mathematically described in terms of the curvature tensor @xcite . in a moving medium , the local co - moving frames of the medium play the role of the local pieces of flat space  time . because theses pieces differ in non  uniform flows , light propagation in a moving medium resembles light propagation in curved space ",
    "i.e. _  the medium appears to light as an effective gravitational field @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one could conceive of employing moving media for creating artificial astronomical objects in the laboratory .",
    "for example , water going down the drain of a bathtub appears to light as a rotating black hole .",
    "however , in order to observe spectacular effects of general relativity in laboratory  based analogues , truly astronomical flow velocities are required .",
    "for establishing a black hole , the fluid should move faster than the speed of light in the medium ( @xmath0 divided by the refractive index @xmath1 ) .",
    "the chances of creating analagoes of black holes are much better when one employs sound instead of light in appropriate supersonic flows @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the most fascinating effects of black holes is hawking radiation @xcite-@xcite , the spontaneous generation of photon pairs near the hole s horizon where one of the photons falls into the hole and the other tunnels out of the attraction zone and become visible .",
    "the acoustical equivalent of hawking radiation is quantum sound in superfluids @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , superfluidity tends to break down before the fluid has a chance to move faster than the speed of sound @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum sound and flow are just two aspects of the same object , the quantum liquid .",
    "the flow is the macroscopic and the sound the microscopic motion . under extreme circumstances such as near the horizon of a sonic black hole",
    ", a clear distinction between sound and flow might be difficult .",
    "an advantage of light in a moving medium is the clear separation between wave and flow , and both light and medium can be regarded as separate quantum systems .",
    "recently , light has been slowed down dramatically @xcite-@xcite due to an effect called electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the use of slow light could open the opportunity for observing the radiation of quantum  optical black holes .",
    "note , however , that slow light is a more complicated phenomenon than light in a moving non  dispersive dielectric where the refractive index does not depend on the frequency of light .",
    "slow light is based on a highly dispersive medium created by dressing the atoms of the medium with an appropriate light beam . instead of the phase velocity",
    "only the group velocity is reduced .",
    "therefore , it is not always advisable to conclude directly from the behavior of light in ordinary dielectrics to the motional effects of slow  light media .",
    "it is the purpose of these notes to clarify the most elementary features of slow light in a moving medium @xcite and , whenever possible , to give an instructive simplified picture .",
    "imagine the medium as being decomposed into drops .",
    "each drop should be small enough such that the flow does not vary significantly within the size of the drop , but each drop should be sufficiently large to sustain several optical oscillations .",
    "we thus assume that the wave length of light is much shorter than the typical scale of changes in the flow . in this case",
    ", we can describe light by a dispersion relation in the local co  moving frame of each medium drop denoted with primes @xmath2 the susceptibility @xmath3 characterizes the medium . in electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite-@xcite a coupling beam dresses the upper two levels of a three  level atom shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "b. , width=302 ]    the dressing of the upper two levels influences strongly the propagation of the probe light with a frequency that should match the atomic transition frequency @xmath4 between the lower and one of the upper levels .",
    "exactly on resonance , the medium decouples from the probe light and becomes transparent , whereas ordinary dielectrics are extremely absorbing at atom  light resonances .",
    "furthermore , the susceptibility changes rapidly , see fig .  2 ,     on the detuning @xmath5 of the probe beam .",
    "the drive beam is assumed to be on resonance .",
    "arbitrary units are used .",
    ", width=302 ]    and , near the resonance , @xmath3 assumes a linear dependence on the detuning between the light frequency @xmath6 and the atomic frequency @xmath4 , @xmath7 giving rise to a very low group velocity @xmath8 .",
    "if the slow  light medium is moving coherently , the motion will slightly detune each atom from exact resonance due to the doppler effect .",
    "imagine that the flow of the medium , @xmath9 , varies only in two dimensions and that the coupling beam propagates orthogonally to the flow , see fig  3 . in this case",
    "we can ignore the first ",
    "order doppler effect of the coupling beam and we should focus only on the doppler detuning of the probe . in the laboratory frame",
    "the probe shall be monochromatic at the atomic frequency @xmath4 . in the co  moving local frames of the medium the probe  light frequency is doppler  shifted with the detuning @xmath10 to first order in @xmath11 .",
    "let us transform the dispersion relation ( [ dr0 ] ) to the laboratory frame .",
    "we take advantage of the lorentz invariance of @xmath12 and obtain to first order in @xmath11 the relation @xmath13 with @xmath14 in ref .",
    "@xcite a more complicated dispersion relation has been derived which is correct up to second order in @xmath11 .",
    "note that the relation ( [ dr1 ] ) describes effects in leading order of @xmath15 , because the second  order corrections of ref .",
    "@xcite are proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "we are going to use the simplified relation ( [ dr1 ] ) to illuminate the most characteristic features of slow light in moving media .",
    "first we note that we can write the relation as @xmath17 monochromatic light waves with fixed polarization thus obey the wave equation @xmath18 the flow has a two  fold effect : on one hand , the velocity @xmath19 appears as an effective vector potential , for example the magnetic vector potential acting on an electron wave @xcite , and , on the other hand , the hydrodynamic pressure proportional to @xmath20 @xcite acts as a scalar potential .",
    "this resembles the rntgen effect of static electromagnetic fields on polarizable atoms @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can regard the flow as generating an effective gravitational field . to see this , we introduce the four  dimensional wave vector @xmath21 and , adopting einstein s summation convention , write the dispersion relation ( [ dr1 ] ) as @xmath22 with the contravariant metric tensor @xmath23 four  dimensional wave vectors are null vectors with respect to the effective metric @xmath24 and , in turn @xcite , light rays follow zero - geodesics with respect to the line element @xmath25 the covariant metric tensor @xmath26 is the inverse of the contravariant one , and is given by @xmath27 in contrast to sound @xcite or light in non ",
    "dispersive media @xcite , a genuine event horizon of slow light can not exist at this level of approximation .",
    "the potential existence of an event horizon is thus confined to effects to second order in @xmath15which are excluded from our simplified model @xcite .",
    "to get more insight into the behavior of slow light in moving media , let us study another analogue . consider a non  relativistic free particle attached to moving frames . the particle is supposed to move freely in each of the local frames but is bound to adapt from one frame to the next , similar to light in drops of flowing water .",
    "however we use pure non  relativistic physics to transform from frame to frame . in case",
    "the local frames constitute a global frame , for example a rotating solid body , the particle would move along a straight line with respect to this frame . in the laboratory frame , the particle s trajectory appears to be bent , attributed to the effect of coriolis and centrifugal forces .",
    "the lagrange function of such a fictitious non ",
    "relativistic particle is @xmath28 up to a constant mass factor that we can set to unity , because we are interested in inertial effects only .",
    "the velocity of the local intertial frames is @xmath29 and we have used the non ",
    "relativistic addition theorem of velocities @xmath30 note that we could apply einstein s relativistic addition theorem of velocities to describe light in moving non  dispersive media of refractive index @xmath1 , but we should use an effective speed of light of @xmath31 in the theorem . the momentum of the fictitious non ",
    "relativistic particle is @xmath32 and the hamiltonian is @xmath33 the important point is that we can translate the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) into the dispersion relation ( [ dr1 ] ) by setting @xmath34 with the enhanced effective frame velocity @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "consequently , slow light experiences the moving medium in the same way as a non ",
    "relativistic particle experiences moving inertial frames . excused by its fictitious nature",
    ", the `` non  relativistic '' particle would move at an extraordinary speed reaching @xmath0 in regions where the medium is at rest , because the energy is @xmath35 we obtain from hamilton s equations , @xmath36 the equation of motion of the fictitious particle @xmath37 the first term describes the coriolis and the second the centrifugal force .",
    "consider a specific example of a non  uniform flow , a vortex .",
    "quantum vortices in alkali bose ",
    "einstein condensates have been recently made @xcite .",
    "they give rise to intriguing slow - light phenomena .",
    "however , vortices do not posses genuine event horizons @xcite and they will not radiate spontaneously .",
    "the flow of an ideal vortex of vorticity @xmath38 is @xmath39 written in polar coordinates or using the complex notation @xmath40 , @xmath41 of the planar cartesian coordinates @xmath42 .",
    "the curl of the vortex flow vanishes , @xmath43 and hence we obtain the equation of motion of a particle in an attractive @xmath44 potential @xcite-@xcite , @xmath45 or , in complex notation , @xmath46 the trajectories of the fall into a @xmath44 singularity are well known in polar coordinates @xcite but here we suggest a more elegant description using the complex notation of the planar cartesian coordinates , @xmath47 with the real parameter @xmath48 and @xmath49 one can easily verify that this solution satisfies the equation of motion ( [ z ] ) . in the infinite past , @xmath50 , the trajectories approach @xmath51 from this asymptotics we see that the light is incident from the right to the left with initial velocity @xmath0 and impact parameter @xmath48 .",
    "depending on the impact parameter , the coefficient @xmath52 is real or purely imaginary . in the case of a real @xmath52 when @xmath53 the incident",
    "light particle will be able to escape , because the modulus squared of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , will never reach zero , the vortex core . in the infinite future , @xmath56 , the particle will approach @xmath57 and ,",
    "consequently , leaves at the angle @xmath58 . in the case of a purely imaginary coefficient @xmath52 when @xmath59 the light",
    "is sucked into the vortex , because the modulus squared of @xmath54 , @xmath60 , reaches zero at the time @xmath61 . in practice",
    ", the light will hit the vortex core and will bounce back . in theory",
    ", the fictitious light particle disappears from this world and reappears on another riemann sheet . in the borderline case when @xmath62 the parameter @xmath52 tends to infinity and the trajectory approaches @xmath63 light falling into the vortex core describes distinctive spirals illustrated in fig .  4 .    )",
    "near the vortex core , rays of slow light feel the presence of the centrifugal @xmath44 attraction but no coriolis force , because the curl of the flow vanishes .",
    "light waves , however , will show a distinctive interference pattern , an optical aharonov ",
    "bohm effect @xcite-@xcite due to the long  range nature of a vortex flow .",
    "far outside the vortex core , light rays are hardly deflected , yet rays passing the vortex in flow direction will be dragged and those swimming against the current lag behind .",
    "this does not affect the ray trajectories but it produces a phase shift between the dragged and the lagging rays , and , in turn , creates a typical interference pattern @xcite .",
    "note that the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect of waves in moving media is not restricted to light .",
    "indeed , berry _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have reported and analyzed a beautiful bathtub experiment with water waves in a tank , visualizing clearly the interference structure generated by the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "a further experiment has been reported @xcite showing spiral waves .",

    "for non  integer flux quanta the interference pattern is slightly more complicated , showing , most prominently , a line of zeros of the wave function after passing the vortex ( which resolves the problem of a multi  valued phase , because a phase is not defined when the amplitude is zero ) . even in the case of",
