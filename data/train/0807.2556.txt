    "although homodyne detectors have rather high efficiencies , the violation of the bell - chsh inequality by @xmath35 is far from @xmath67 , the maximum given by tsirelson s bound  @xcite .",
    "one might thus wonder whether even mild detection inefficiencies are sufficient to wash out the bell - chsh inequality violation unveiled in fig .",
    "[ fig : physical2d ] . an important issue to address",
    "is thus given by the effects of detection inefficiencies .",
    "as done before , we first gain an idea of the expected behavior by studying the idealized picture .    in order to quantitatively assess this point ,",
    "we have modeled the imperfect homodyne detector onto which mode @xmath18 impinges as the cascade of a beam splitter of transmittivity @xmath68 , mixing mode @xmath69 to an ancillary vacuum mode @xmath70 , and a perfect homodyner .",

    "the remaining procedure for the construction of the appropriate bell - chsh function remains as described above .",

    "the behavior of the associated bell function is shown , for two values of @xmath68 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ide ] .",
    "we observe a rather striking robustness of the bell function with respect to the homodyners inefficiency : even severely inefficient homodyne detectors would be able to unveil bell - chsh inequality violations with a state which is initially squeezed enough . by simply increasing the squeezing of the input state",
    ", one can compensate the effects of detection inefficiencies .",
    "although for small values of @xmath68 , the required squeezing factor becomes prohibitively large , the trend revealed by the ideal case leaves quite a few hopes for the physical effective one as well .",
    "in fact , such robustness persists when the local operations  ( [ rotazioni ] ) are used , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : physical2d ] for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( chosen for easiness of representation ) .",
    "the squeezing threshold at which the bell s inequality test starts to be violated increases only quite slowly as the quality of the homodyne detectors is degraded . in passing",
    ", we should stress that the beam - splitter model used for the description of an inefficient homodyne detector can be used in order to describe the influences of external zero - temperature reservoirs coupled to the correlated two - mode state we are studying .",
    "thus , similar conclusions regarding the resilience of the bell - chsh function to losses induced by a low - temperature environment can be drawn .",
    "we complete our study about the effects of imperfections by investigating the case in which we start with a mixed resource .",
    "this is practically quite relevant , given the fact that , experimentally , a single - mode squeezed thermal state is in general produced instead of a pure single - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "this is formally accounted for by considering the resource state @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82 is the glauber - sudarshan function of a single - mode state at thermal equilibrium with mean photon number @xmath83 and displaced , in phase space , by @xmath84  @xcite while @xmath85 is mode-@xmath86 squeezing operator .",

    "it is straightforward to find that eq .",
    "( [ squeezedthermal ] ) can be written as @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 this state is then locally rotated and projected onto quadrature eigenstates by means of homodyne measurements .",

    ", one can easily build up the bell - chsh function and test its behavior against the thermal parameter @xmath94 and , as usual , the squeezing .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : misto ] , where it is shown that it is enough to consider a slightly more squeezed initial resource in order to counteract any thermal effect .",
    "the same conclusions are reached by using the set of nonlinear unitary transformations @xmath51 , although the analysis is largely numerical and more involved .",
    "the required level of squeezing , _ e.g. _ @xmath95 for @xmath96 , revealed in figs .  2 and 3 to demonstrate bell - chsh inequality violations is experimentally difficult to achieve using current technology . in this section , we show that this requirement can be radically reduced by using another class of gaussian states .",
    "so far , we have investigated the bell s inequality test under nonlinear operations using the paradigmatic source given by state @xmath35 . however , the behaviour of a bell - chsh function strongly depends on intrinsic properties of the tested quantum correlated state .",
    "in fact , this can be seen as the  dual \" of the well - known fact that the same bipartite entangled state behaves differently , in terms of bell inequality tests , under different sets of local operations . here , we are interested in finding out whether another realistic gaussian resource is conceivable for the violation of our bell - chsh inequality when smaller values of @xmath11 are taken .",
    "our starting point is the observation  @xcite @xmath97 where we have used the single - mode squeezing operator @xmath98~(j = a , b)$ ] and its two - mode version @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "therefore , our resource @xmath35 is formally equivalent to a two - mode squeezed state that is also subjected to additional local squeezing operation .",
    "these latter are unable to change the nonlocal content of the state being used and could well be regarded as a pre - stage of the local actions ( comprising nonlinear rotations and homodyne measurements ) performed at alice s and bob s site respectively .",
    "we now remove them from the overall setup for bell s inequality tests by considering , instead of eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) , the standard two - mode squeezed vacuum  @xcite @xmath100 with weight function  @xcite @xmath101 .",
    "the adaptation of the formal procedure described in our work to the use of this gaussian resource is quite straightforward . for the simple case of ideal local rotations , the correlation function for joint outcomes at alice s and bob s site is identical to eq .",
    "( [ corre1 m ] ) with the replacement @xmath102 .",
    "the violation of the local realistic bound occurs now for @xmath103 and the entire bell - chsh function shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : ide ] * ( a ) * is  shifted back \" on the @xmath11 axis accordingly this effect is the same when eqs .",
    "( [ rotazioni ] ) are used , although the form of @xmath104 is too cumbersome to be shown here . for clarity",
    ", we note that a two - mode squeezed state of squeezing @xmath11 can be generated using two single - mode squeezed states of the same degree of squeezing and a beam splitter as @xmath105 this means that single mode squeezed states of @xmath106 ( @xmath107db ) can be used as resources to show violations of bell s inequality .",
    "this makes our proposal closer to an experimental implementation as such high levels of squeezing can be generated ( for example , up to 10db @xcite ) using current technology .",
    "on the other hand , the local nonlinear operations may be more demanding and various types of unitary interactions need to be investigated to improve experimental feasibility of our approach .",
    "we have shown a way to unveil violations of bell s inequality for two - mode gaussian states by means of nonlinear local operations and gaussian homodyne measurements .",
    "besides its theoretical interest , which stays at the center of current investigations on entangled cv systems and their fundamental features , our study emerges as an appealing alternative to the current strategy for bell s inequality tests based on the use of appropriately de - gaussified resources and high - efficiency homodyning .",
    "our proposal has been shown to be robust against the inefficiency of the homodyne detection and mixedness in the initial resource .",
    "this robustness is consistent with a previous study using entangled thermal states @xcite .",
    "while the squeezing degree of @xmath108 required for resource gaussian states is possible to achieve using present day technology , the strong nonlinear interactions required to implement the local operations may be more difficult to realize .",
    "on the other hand , it is worth noting that there has been remarkable progress to obtain strong nonlinear effects  @xcite .",
    "there remains some interesting future work .",
    "as the local operations used in our paper are not necessarily optimized ones , the research for more efficient local operations is desirable . since we have used nonlinear operations to reveal violations of bell s inequality for gaussian states and gaussian measurements , it is also natural to extend this investigation to entanglement distillation protocols for the gaussian states . interesting open questions are therefore whether there exist such entanglement distillation protocols using the type of local operations employed in this paper and how much they would be feasible and useful .",
