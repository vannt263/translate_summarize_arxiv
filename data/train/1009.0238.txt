    "random walks are widely used to model natural processes in physics , chemistry , and biology @xcite . in particular , first - passage and persistence statistics @xcite of multiple random walks underlie reaction - diffusion processes @xcite , spin systems @xcite , and polymer dynamics @xcite .",
    "first - passage processes involving multiple random walks are equivalent to diffusion in a restricted region of space .",
    "for example , the probability that @xmath0 ordinary random walks do not meet is equivalent to the probability that a `` compound '' walk in @xmath0 dimensions remains confined to the region .",
    "this probability decays as in the long - time limit @xcite .    when there are only two or three particles , the compound walk is , in many cases , confined to a wedge , formed by two intersecting planes .",
    "moreover , the well - known properties of diffusion inside an absorbing wedge @xcite explain the long - time kinetics @xcite .",
    "in general , however , the absorbing boundary is defined by multiple intersecting planes in a high - dimensional space . apart from a few special cases , diffusion subject to such complicated boundaries conditions remains an open problem @xcite .",
    "our goal is to use cones in high dimensions to approximate the absorbing boundaries that underlie such first - passage processes . in this study",
    ", we obtain analytic results for the survival probability of a diffusing particle inside an absorbing cone in arbitrary dimension . in a follow - up study @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate that cones provide useful approximations to first - passage characteristics of multiple random walks @xcite .    .",

    "the central quantity in our study is the probability @xmath5 that the particle does not reach the cone boundary up to time @xmath6 .",
    "regardless of the starting position , this survival probability decays algebraically , @xmath7 , in the long - time limit .",
    "first , we find the exponent @xmath8 analytically by solving the laplace equation inside the cone . in dimensions two and four",

    "ii , we write the diffusion equation that governs the survival probability , and show that finding the leading asymptotic behavior of the survival probability requires a solution to the laplace equation @xcite .",

    "the bulk of the paper deals with asymptotic analysis for very large dimensions .",
    "in particular , we derive scaling properties of the exponent and obtain the limiting behaviors of the scaling function ( section v ) .",
    "asymptotic results for extremely thin and extremely wide cones are detailed in sections vi and vii , respectively .",

    "the survival probability fully quantifies the first - passage process .",

    "the exponent @xmath35 depends on the spatial dimension @xmath4 and the opening angle @xmath3 .",

    "the leading asymptotic behavior is @xmath54 as @xmath34 . in particular",
    ", the survival probability grows algebraically with distance , @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the problem of finding the leading asymptotic behavior of the survival probability reduces to an electrostatic problem @xcite as the amplitude satisfies laplace s equation .",
    "our goal is to find the exponent @xmath8 and the angular function @xmath47 .",
    "we expect that the exponent is a monotonically decreasing function of the opening angle @xmath3 .",
    "also , in all dimensions , @xmath21 because a cone with opening angle @xmath13 is a half - space and consequently , the first - passage probability is identical to that of a particle in the vicinity of a trap in one dimension @xcite .",
    "we first discuss two special cases where explicit solutions are possible . in dimension two , the second order differential equation reads , and the two independent solutions are simply @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath53 excludes the latter and therefore , @xmath58 henceforth , the subscript indicates the dimension .",
    "since the linear equation specifies the angular function only up to an overall constant , we set the prefactor to one throughout this paper .",
    "the boundary condition and the requirement that the angular function must be positive everywhere inside the cone together imply @xmath59 . therefore , the exponent is @xcite @xmath60 as expected , the exponent is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath3 , and @xmath61 .",

    "the first solution is not physical because it implies a divergence of @xmath66 as @xmath83 @xcite . in odd dimensions ,",
    "the second solution is excluded for the same reason .",
    "therefore @xcite , @xmath84 the boundary condition @xmath49 relates the exponent @xmath8 and the opening angle @xmath3 , @xmath85 in general dimension , the exponent @xmath8 is the smallest root of the transcendental equation involving the associated legendre functions .",
    "we must always choose the smallest root because @xmath68 for all @xmath39 .",
    "versus @xmath86 at different dimensions .",
    "this exponent is given explicitly by and in dimensions @xmath87 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "in general , the exponent is a root of the transcendental equation .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we can verify that the exponent @xmath8 decreases monotonically with the opening angle @xmath3 , and that @xmath88 ( figure [ fig - beta ] ) . in all dimensions , the exponent diverges for extremely thin cones , @xmath89 , and when @xmath90 , the exponent vanishes when @xmath72 .     versus the normalized polar angle @xmath91 at different dimensions .",
    "the function @xmath47 is normalized such that @xmath92 .",

    "there are two possibilities : ( i ) if @xmath95 , the first - passage process speeds up with increasing dimension because @xmath8 increases ( figure [ fig - beta ] ) and @xmath47 declines ( figure [ fig - psi]a ) ; ( ii ) if @xmath96 , the first - passage process slows down because @xmath8 shrinks ( figure [ fig - beta ] ) and @xmath47 grows ( figure [ fig - psi]b ) .",
    "ultimately , in the infinite - dimension limit , first passage becomes instantaneous for acute angles but infinitely long for obtuse angles .    in dimension three , @xmath97 , and",
    "the solution reduces to the legendre function of index @xmath98 , namely , @xcite .",
    "also , the exponent @xmath8 is the smallest root of the transcendental equation @xcite @xmath99    for half - integer values of the exponent , @xmath100 , the angular function @xmath101 is a polynomial of degree @xmath102 in @xmath103 .",
    "this follows directly from equation .",

    "the parabolic cylinder function is related to a hermite polynomial , @xmath128 , and hence , is equivalent to @xmath129 , where the largest root is the appropriate one .",
    "therefore , the half - integer values of the scaling function @xmath125 occur at zeroes of hermite polynomials .",
