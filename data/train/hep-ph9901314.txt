    "the cross section for forward jet production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has been proposed as a particularly sensitive means to investigate the parton dynamics at small @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "analytic calculations based on the bfkl equation @xcite in the leading - logarithmic approximation show a strong rise of this cross section with decreasing @xmath2 @xcite and were found in reasonable agreement @xcite with the first data from the h1 collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "more recent measurements of the forward cross section , based on an order of magnitude increased statistics compared to @xcite , have been presented recently by the zeus @xcite and the h1 @xcite collaborations confirming the earlier findings @xcite .",
    "monte carlo generators based on direct photon interactions ( dir ) calculated from leading order ( lo ) @xmath3 matrix elements together with leading - logarithm    parton showers disagree with the measured jet cross section @xcite by an appreciable factor . also next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , i.e. @xmath4",
    ", calculations predict too small forward cross sections at small @xmath2 as already shown by mirkes and zeppenfeld @xcite using their mepjet program @xcite when comparing to the data in @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed also with the new data in @xcite .",
    "a similar deficiency between nlo calculations and measured data occurs for the dijet rate in the region @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the transverse energy of the produced jets and @xmath7 is the usual squared lepton momentum transfer .",
    "this kinematic range is also relevant for the forward jet production , as will be seen later .",
    "the region of small enough @xmath7 is the photoproduction regime where the virtual photon resolves into partons . indeed , introducing a resolved photon contribution , the measured dijet rate and the forward jet cross section can be described satisfactorily @xcite concerning the shape of the cross section as a function of @xmath2 as well as the absolute normalization .",
    "this description is based on the monte carlo program rapgap @xcite which includes a resolved photon contribution in addition to the direct process , which both are evaluated with lo matrix elements with additional emissions in the initial and final state generated by parton showers together with subsequent hadronization",
    ".    the dijet rate has been calculated also in nlo including direct and resolved photon contributions @xcite . in order to avoid double counting in the full nlo calculation ,",
    "the contribution from the virtual photon splitting into @xmath8 pairs , where either the quark or the antiquark subsequently interacts with a parton originating from the proton , had to be subtracted @xcite , similar as is done in the nlo theory for the photoproduction of jets @xcite .",
    "the subtracted terms in the nlo direct contribution are part of the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) of the virtual photon and appear in the resolved contribution in an evolved form .",
    "with this procedure the whole cross section for two - jet production , which is a superposition of the direct and resolved contributions minus the photon splitting piece , becomes to a large extent independent of the factorization scale at the photon vertex .",
    "this full nlo calculation of the dijet rate agreed well with the h1 data over the full @xmath7 domain , @xmath9  gev@xmath10 , and the @xmath2 domain , @xmath11 , and for jet transverse momenta @xmath12 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we want to present the results of a calculation of the forward jet cross section on the basis of the nlo theory used for the dijet rate .",
    "although the kinematic constraints , very low @xmath2 and @xmath13 of order one , are rather similar , it is not obvious that the calculated cross sections will agree with the recent zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite experimental results .",
    "after some comparisons with the mepjet results @xcite to make sure that our dis jet program , called jetvip @xcite , gives the same results under identical kinematical conditions we shall give our results with the experimental cuts of the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite analysis .",
    "we close with a short summary and an outlook to future studies .",
    "before we present our results with the zeus and h1 kinematical constraints for selecting the forward jets we performed a check of our program jetvip with the forward jet kinematics by comparing with the nlo results of mirkes and zeppenfeld @xcite , who have produced their results with the fixed order program mepjet @xcite , which only includes direct photon contributions .",
    "we have chosen the same kinematical cuts , which differ somewhat from the cuts used in the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite analyses .",
    "the @xmath3 results are obtained taking the glck , reya and vogt ( grv ) lo proton pdf s @xcite together with the one - loop formula for @xmath14 . for the @xmath4 results we employ the grv higher order pdf s together with the two - loop running @xmath14 formula .",
    "we take @xmath15 and match the strong coupling at the charm and bottom thresholds @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "jets are defined in the laboratory frame using the cone algorithm with the opening angle @xmath17 in the so - called e - scheme . in this scheme the four - vector of the combined jet",
    "is given as the sum of the four - vectors of the two partons .",
    "the differences of pseudorapidities and azimuthal angles with respect to the jet direction are @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "all jets have to fulfill @xmath20 and @xmath21  gev , where the index b refers to quantities in the breit frame . @xmath22 and @xmath6 are measured in the hera laboratory frame .",
    "additional cuts are made for events which contain a forward jet .",
    "these requirements are @xmath23 and @xmath24  gev with @xmath25 the @xmath2 variable is restricted to the small-@xmath2 region of @xmath26 .",
    "the cuts on the electron variables are @xmath27  gev@xmath10 , @xmath28 , @xmath29  gev and @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the electron and proton energies are @xmath31  gev and @xmath32  gev , respectively .",
    "the positive @xmath33-direction is the direction of the incoming proton momentum .",
    "the renormalization ( @xmath34 ) and factorization scales ( @xmath35 ) are taken equal and are identified with the sum @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the parton s transverse momentum , are related in the breit frame by @xmath39 ^ 2 = 2e_i^2(1-\\cos\\theta_{ip})=\\frac{2}{1+\\cos\\theta_{ip } }     [ p_t^b(i)]^2   , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the angle between the parton and the proton direction in the breit system . in lo one - jet production , i.e. , in the naive parton model limit , @xmath41 . with these constraints",
    "we obtain the cross sections in tab . 1 , where our jetvip results are compared to results from @xcite , referenced as mepjet in the table .",
    "in addition to the forward jet cross sections we also list the full 2-jet , inclusive 2-jet and exclusive 3-jet cross sections . compared to these cross sections , the kinematic constraints defining the forward cross section lead to considerable reductions .",
    "furthermore we notice that the nlo corrections to the forward jet cross sections are large in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the o(@xmath42 ) single - jet cross section is not considered since it vanishes if a forward jet is required , due to the kinematical restrictions of the phase space .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first , the lo resolved cross section is @xmath43% larger than the subtracted photon splitting term .",
    "part of this increase is due to the evolution of the pdf s of the photon .",
    "the other part comes from the gluon component of the photon pdf , which amounts to 7.3 pb .",
    "second , the nlo corrections to the resolved cross section give a further increase as compared to the lo result of approximately @xmath44 , which originates from the nlo corrections to the resolved matrix elements .",
    "we conclude , that the nlo resolved contribution supplies higher order terms in two ways , first through the nlo corrections in the hard scattering cross section and second in the leading logarithmic approximation by evolving the pdf s of the virtual photon to the chosen factorization scale .",
    "this way we sum the logarithms in @xmath13 , which , however , in the considered kinematical region is not an important effect numerically , as we have seen in tab .  2 .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of the nlo direct cross section through inclusion of resolved processes in nlo is mainly due to the convolution of the point - like term in the photon pdf with the nlo resolved matrix elements , which gives an approximation to the nnlo direct cross section without resolved contributions .",
    "one of the dominant contributions to the forward cross section is shown in fig .  1 ( left part ) , where the photon splitting term is convoluted with a matrix element that provides two gluons in the final state .",
    "this way one gluon rung is added to the gluon ladder as compared to the corresponding nlo direct cross section , shown on the right of fig .  1 .",
    "the additional gluon in the nlo resolved term is in our approach calculated from perturbative qcd , producing an additional term which makes a contribution to the forward jet . in the bfkl approach for the forward jet cross section @xcite",
    "this extra gluon is part of the bfkl evolution .",
    "in contrast , the nlo direct term in fig .",
    "1 ( right part ) contains also additional gluons in the dglap evolution of the proton pdf , which , however , are not resolved , i.e. , go to the proton remnant . another way to generate",
    "a larger forward jet cross section would be to go to the nnlo corrections of the direct cross section , which has not been done yet .",
    "we think that including the nlo resolved component produces a reasonable approximation to this nnlo cross section .",
    "such a correspondence is present at one order lower . as already remarked above",
    ", the superposition of the lo direct and resolved cross section is almost equal to the nlo direct cross section .",

    "as proton pdf s we apply now the cteq4 m parametrization @xcite with the two - loop @xmath14 . we take @xmath15 as before and match the value of @xmath14 at the thresholds @xmath16 with a @xmath45 as used in cteq4 m .",
    "jets are defined with the cone algorithm in the hera frame as described above , except that the axis of the jet is calculated now as the transverse energy weighted mean of @xmath22 and @xmath46 of the two partons or jets belonging to the combined jet .",
    "this kind of jet definition was also applied in the experimental jet analysis . as scales",
    "we choose @xmath47 with a fixed @xmath48  gev@xmath10 related to the mean @xmath49 of the forward jet .",
    "we take this fixed value of @xmath50 instead of @xmath6 for technical reasons , since the calculations in jetvip start from the hadronic c.m.s .. the choice @xmath51 is mandatory if we want to include a resolved contribution .",

    "@xmath54 only for @xmath55 , which covers only part of the zeus kinematical range . to have a resolved cross section in all @xmath13 bins we consider the choice @xmath56 more appropriate .    in the two experiments the forward jet selection criteria are different . in the zeus experiment",
    "the kinematical constraints are : @xmath57  gev , @xmath28 , @xmath58 and @xmath24  gev with the forward jet constraints @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "our results for the forward jet cross section under these zeus kinematical conditions are shown in fig .",
    "2 a , b . in fig .",
    "2 a we plotted the full o(@xmath63 ) inclusive two - jet cross section ( dir ) as a function of @xmath2 for three different scales @xmath64 and @xmath65 and compared them with the measured points from zeus @xcite .",
    "as to be expected the calculated nlo direct cross section is by a factor 2 to 4 too small compared to the data .",
    "the variation inside the assumed range of scales is small , so that also with a reasonable change of scales we can not get agreement with the data . in fig .",
    "2 b we show the corresponding forward jet cross sections with the nlo resolved contribution included , as described in the previous subsection , again for the three different scales @xmath66 as in fig .",
    "2 a. now we find good agreement with the zeus data .",
    "the scale variation of the calculated cross section is larger than in fig . 2 a. in particular",
    ", the largest scale gives now the largest cross section opposite to what is observed in fig .",
    "2 a. this different scale variation comes primarily from the scale dependence of the virtual photon pdf .",
    "this factorization scale variation is supposed to be compensated between the lo resolved and the nlo direct contribution but not for the nlo resolved contribution .",
    "this could only occur if we could include the nnlo direct contribution which , however , is not available .",
    "since the nlo resolved contribution for the forward jet is rather large , as discussed above , this scale dependence can not be avoided . on the other hand ,",
    "the scale dependence is not so large that we must fear our results not to be trustworthy . in fig .",
    "2 b the cross section is labeled dir@xmath67+res , where dir@xmath67 stands for nlo direct minus the photon - quark - antiquark splitting term .",
    "we have calculated the forward jet cross section also with the scale @xmath68 . for this choice",
    "we obtain a somewhat smaller cross section which is approximately equal to the cross section with the scale @xmath69 .",

    "compared to the zeus data the h1 measurements extend down to smaller @xmath2 . in the lowest @xmath2 bin ,",
    "@xmath83 the forward jet cross section has a dip , which is also reproduced in the theoretical calculation and which is due to the kinematical constraints for selecting forward jets .",
    "we conclude that the nlo theory with a resolved virtual photon contribution gives a good description of both , the zeus and the h1 forward jet data .",
    "it is important , that both components , the direct and the resolved one , are calculated up to nlo .",
    "a lo calculation of both components would fall short of the experimental data , as it is clear from the results presented in tab .",

    "we remark that the forward jet cross sections as measured by zeus and h1 are obtained at the hadron level , i.e. , the jets are constructed from measured hadron momenta using the same cone algorithm . in our nlo calculation",
    "the jets are combined from partons with the same jet algorithm .",
    "the size of the corrections from hadron to parton level has been studied by the zeus collaboration @xcite using several monte carlo simulation programs with the result that for the models which account very well for the zeus forward jet cross sections the correction factors are close to unity for all @xmath2 values considered in the analysis . in the h1 work similar results",
    "are reported @xcite .    in @xcite the h1",
    "forward jet data are also successfully described with the rapgap model @xcite which includes a direct and a resolved component , both in lo , and with a similar scale @xmath66 as we have used . in addition",
    "this model has leading logarithm parton showers in the initial and final state built in .",
    "we think that these parton shower contributions produce the higher order effects which we found necessary to account for the correct normalization and the @xmath2 dependence of the forward jet cross section data .",
    "we conclude that the measurements of the forward jet cross section presented recently by the zeus and h1 collaborations can be described very well by the nlo theory with direct and resolved virtual photon contributions added in a consistent way .",
    "the theory shows good agreement with the data with respect to the normalization and also the functional dependence with decreasing @xmath2 . whereas this variation of the cross section with @xmath2 is also compatible with the nlo predictions based on direct photons , for the correct normalization",
    "the resolved component up to nlo is needed . to avoid double counting the @xmath84 splitting term",
    "is removed from the nlo direct contribution .",
    "in contrast , lo bfkl predictions @xcite yield much larger forward cross sections than the data @xcite .",
    "these calculations suffer , however , from several deficiencies .",
    "they are asymptotic and do not contain the correct kinematic constraints of the produced jets @xcite . furthermore they do not allow the implementation of a jet algorithm as used in the experimental analysis . also nlo @xmath85 terms in the bfkl kernel @xcite predict large negative corrections which are expected to reduce the forward cross section as well .",
    "when all these points are taken into account the bfkl approach may give an equally well description of the forward jet data . even if this is the case",
    ", it is clear from this work that the bfkl theory is not the only theoretical approach that describes the forward jet cross sections ."
