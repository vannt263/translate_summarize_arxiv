    "in an impure disordered conductor ( either a metal or a doped semiconductor ) scattering by static impurities and defects , in general , leads to two distinct momentum relaxation times ; the scattering life time or the transport relaxation time ( denoted by @xmath1 in this paper , but often just called @xmath7 ) and the quantum lifetime or the single - particle relaxation time ( denoted by @xmath0 in this paper , but often also called @xmath8 ) .",
    "although @xmath9 and @xmath10 both arise from impurity scattering in the metallic regime , they are in general distinct and unique with no direct analytical relationship connecting them , except for the simple ( and often unrealistic ) model of completely isotropic @xmath11-wave zero - range impurity scattering when they are equal .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 determines the conductivity , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the carrier density and @xmath14 the mobility , whereas @xmath10 determines the quantum level broadening , @xmath15 , of the momentum eigenstates ( i.e. the band states defined by a momentum @xmath16 with @xmath17 as the conserved wave vector ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath10 arises from the subtle effect of the wave vector dependent impurity potential @xmath18 which distinguishes between momentum scattering in _ all _ directions contributing to @xmath19 and transport relaxation @xmath20 which is unaffected by forward scattering ( or more generally , small - angle scattering ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study theoretically @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the 2d graphene layer due to long - range and short - range impurity scattering , finding interesting behavior in the ratio @xmath21 as a function of impurity location , carrier density , and the system environment ( e.g. the background lattice dielectric constant of the substrate ) .",
    "we compare graphene @xmath21 with the corresponding situation in the extensively studied 2d semiconductor systems , finding significant difference .    in 3d metals or semiconductors ,",
    "the effective impurity - electron interaction potential is almost always short - ranged .",
    "this is true even when the bare impurity potential is long - range coulombic since carrier - induced electronic screening of the charged impurities is highly effective .",
    "this strongly screened short - range impurity potential in 3d systems ( as well as in 2d systems when electrons and impurities are not spatially separated ) has led to the almost universal theoretical adoption of the uncorrelated white - noise zero - range impurity potential model for studying the impurity scattering effect on `` metallic '' transport properties .",
    "since such a white - noise disorder , by definition , leads to isotropic impurity scattering dominated entirely by large - angle scattering , @xmath22 in ordinary metals and semiconductors for such a zero - range disorder model as forward scattering simply plays no special role here .",
    "graphene is , however , qualitatively different even for this short - range white noise disorder model due to its chiral sublattice symmetry which suppresses backward ( i.e. a scattering induced wave vector change by @xmath23 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) scattering @xcite , thus introducing an intrinsic chiral preference for forward scattering over backward scattering . as we show later in this paper , due to this suppression of backward scattering",
    ", the zero - range white - noise disorder potential model leads to @xmath26 in graphene in contrast to the @xmath22 in ordinary metals and semiconductors .",
    "this is due to the importance of @xmath5 ( rather than @xmath23 ) scattering in dominating graphene transport properties whereas the small - angle scattering always dominates @xmath10 .    for long - range impurity scattering ,",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that @xmath9 can exceed @xmath10 by a large factor , and in high - mobility 2d modulation - doped semiconductor structures , where the predominant scattering is the small - angle scattering due to charged impurities located far from the 2d electron layer , in general @xmath27 . in this paper",
    ", we theoretically calculate @xmath21 ( as well as @xmath9 and @xmath10 individually ) for 2d graphene electrons ( and holes ) due to both long - range and short - range impurity scattering , taking into account the dependence on the impurity location .",
    "we find that there are significant differences between 2d graphene ( with its linear chiral dispersion ) and 2d semiconductors , showing that @xmath21 in general could also be very large for graphene although the behavior is quite different from the corresponding 2d semiconductors .",
    "our work is restricted entirely to extrinsic or doped ( or gated ) graphene where the fermi level is away from the charge neutral dirac point ( taken to be the energy zero ) .",
    "there has been extensive recent theoretical work @xcite on the charged impurity scattering limited transport properties in gated extrinsic graphene , but the single - particle quantum relaxation time @xmath10 ( and its relation to the transport scattering time @xmath9 ) has not been discussed .",
    "we note that while @xmath9 has been experimentally studied recently in extrinsic graphene @xcite through measurements of density - dependent conductivity , the corresponding @xmath10 has not yet been directly experimentally measured .",
    "the most direct way of measuring @xmath10 experimentally is by measuring the quantum level broadening @xmath28 through the dingle temperature @xmath29 .",
    "the dingle temperature can be measured in low - field sdh magnetoresistance oscillations as has been done extensively in 2d semiconductor structures @xcite .",
    "any measurement of the single - particle level broadening , e.g. magnetization , also gives an estimate for @xmath10 .",
    "experimental comparisons of @xmath21 for various system parameters ( e.g. carrier density , impurity location , materials parameters such as effective mass and lattice dielectric constant ) have been carried out in semiconductor based 2d systems , but not in graphene since measurements of @xmath10 are unavailable in graphene .",
    "extensive measurements of @xmath9 as a function of carrier density , i.e. gate voltage , however , have been carried out @xcite in graphene recently .    in our theoretical calculations ( and in the numerical results ) we have used two complementary models of bare disorder : long - range random charged impurity centers at or near the graphene - substrate interface and short - range model white noise disorder in the graphene layer .",
    "we also include screening ( by the graphene carriers themselves ) within random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the theory . in sec .",
    "ii we describe theoretical details and present our results . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the relevance and significance of our theory in the context of transport experiments in gated or doped graphene , and provide a conclusion .",

    "( [ eq : scattime_r ] ) ] and the single - particle relaxation time @xmath10 [ eq .",
    "( [ scat_s ] ) ] is the weighting factor @xmath58 in the transport scattering time .",
    "the factor @xmath59 weights the amount of backward scattering of the electron by the impurity .",
    "small angle ( or forward ) scattering , where @xmath60 , is relatively unimportant in contributing to @xmath61 and contributes little to the resistivity . in normal 2d systems",
    "the factor @xmath59 obviously favors large angle scattering events , which are more important for the electrical resistivity .",
    "however , in graphene the large angle scattering is also suppressed due to the wave function overlap factor @xmath62 .",
    "the transport scattering time thus gets weighted by an angular contribution factor of @xmath63 , which suppresses both small - angle scattering and large - angle scattering contributions in the transport scattering rate .",
    "however , the single particle relaxation time is weighted only by @xmath62 term . therefore , @xmath1 is insensitive to both small and large angle scatterings while @xmath0 is only sensitive to small angle scattering events .",
    "in fact , the dominant contribution to @xmath9 comes from @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 scattering , which is equivalent to @xmath66 `` right - angle''scattering in contrast to the @xmath23 back scattering in ordinary 2d systems .",
