    "virtually every massive galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole in its core .",
    "these central black holes exhibit tight correlations with properties of their host galaxies bulges @xcite : bulge mass @xcite , bulge luminosity @xcite , and bulge stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "recently these correlations were re - explored using the wealth of new black hole mass measurements ( @xmath3 ) and galaxy parameters by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the discovery that the @xmath4 relation may evolve with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has led to the suggestion that the most basic scaling relation may instead be with total stellar mass @xcite ; in this case , the evolution of the @xmath4 relation with redshift indicates the changing fractions of mass in galaxy bulges ( which contribute to @xmath5 ) versus disks ( which do not ) .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed review of our current understanding of black hole scaling relations .",
    "the mechanism through which black hole masses correlate with galaxy properties has been canonically associated with gas - rich galaxy mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "gravitational torques funnel the gas into their centers , triggering two phenomena : an intense burst of star formation to feed the bulge , and accretion of gas on to the black holes in the centers of each galaxy .",
    "it has been postulated that black hole growth can regulate this process through agn feedback @xcite via massive winds that evacuate the gas from the galaxy on short timescales , cutting off star formation and future black hole growth .",
    "this sense of self - regulation has been confirmed observationally by @xcite , who find that the eddington ratio of a sample of agns depends on the supply of cold gas in the galaxy . if there is plenty of cold gas , the accretion rate does not depend on the quantity of gas available ; if the supply of cold gas is limited , the accretion rate depends on the rate at which stellar winds provide fuel for the agn .",
    "though the detailed mechanisms causing these correlations are still unconfirmed , star formation and black hole growth are fed by the same reservoir of inflowing gas ; their growth histories are intertwined .",
    "it is likely that these two processes compete for fuel in a predictable fashion .    to understand this interplay , it is critical to look at systems in the midst of this increased fueling .",
    "one set of such galaxies are gas - rich mergers , which tend to have extreme bursts of star formation and a higher incidence of agn activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during such a merger , does the black hole grow first , leaving the stars to slowly consume the remaining gas ? or is star formation quenched once the black hole reaches a bright quasar phase of extreme growth ?",
    "the position of a merger on black hole scaling relations would indicate the relative growth timescales , and confirm whether the putative quasar - mode feedback occurs at the end of a merger ( see figure  [ scalingrelationtracks ] for the schematic example for the @xmath4 relation . ) . as",
    "star formation happens on few - kiloparsec spatial scales , accreting gas must lose less angular momentum to fuel a starburst than to feed a black hole .",
    "subsequent models therefore suggest that a black hole would grow substantially only after star formation has quenched itself and the galaxy bulge is in place @xcite , or at least that the peak black hole accretion time occurs later in a merger relative to peak star formation @xcite .",
    "this scenario would predict that gas - rich mergers would fall below black hole scaling relations .",
    "relation for isolated galaxies from @xcite ( black ) with three possible evolutionary tracks for merging galaxies overlaid .",
    "if the black hole grows first or more quickly than the galaxy bulge , mergers would lie above the relation ( as shown by the gold arrows ) .",
    "if the black hole growth lags the bulge growth and is responsible for curtailing evolution ( e.g. quenching through agn feedback ) , mergers would lie below the relation ( as shown by the purple arrows ) .",
    "if instead the black hole and the bulge grow in lockstep , the mergers would remain on the relation ( as shown by the blue arrow ) . ]",
    "merger - driven galaxy evolution is not a complete explanation for all black hole growth , however .",
    "though some agn studies find a correlation with major mergers @xcite , agns found with other selection techniques and at different redshift ranges do not show a higher rate of merging than field galaxies @xcite . instead of mergers bringing in gas ,",
    "some systems probably are undergoing secular evolution , accreting their gas directly from the cold intergalactic medium .",
    "bar and spiral disk instabilities are capable of dissipating sufficient angular momentum from this gas to fuel black hole growth @xcite .",
    "the dividing line between these two processes is not yet well understood ; here we focus on understanding the black hole growth due to major mergers .    nearby ( ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies ( ( u)lirgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are an excellent sample with which to study such gas - rich mergers .",
    "these galaxies have infrared luminosities upwards of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 for ulirgs ) , generally caused by a starburst and/or an agn heating up dust .",
    "their infrared luminosities correlate with merger rate , star formation rate , and agn fraction @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the local universe , such strong infrared activity is almost exclusively triggered by major mergers : @xcite showed that in a complete sample of iras ulirgs , 117 out of 118 galaxies are in the midst of strong tidal interactions .    in a companion paper @xcite , we have studied the kinematics of both gas and stars in the inner kiloparsecs of a sample of ( u)lirgs , finding that nuclear disks on scales of a few tens to hundreds of parsecs are common . in two other papers @xcite , we demonstrated a technique that uses high spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy to measure black hole masses . with kinematic maps that resolve inside the sphere of influence of a black hole , the complex and unrelaxed large - scale dynamics are less important , and black hole masses can be measured to within a factor of a few .",
    "we note that this technique measures the unresolved central mass , which includes both the black hole and its accretion disk , and in some cases may also include a reservoir of gas feeding the accretion disk . in @xcite , the black hole mass in mrk273",
    "n measured with this technique was consistent with the measurement made by oh maser kinematics @xcite .    using a robust technique such as this to measure black hole masses in these gas - rich mergers is important because more traditional methods of black hole mass measurements rely on assumptions that are nt valid in the case of galaxy mergers .",
    "three - integral orbital superposition models ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are able to use large - field kinematics to separate different components to the mass profile of the galaxy ; however , this approach requires a dynamically relaxed system and is used therefore in isolated galaxies .",
    "another successful black hole mass measurement technique is reverberation mapping ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which measures the time lag between flux variations of the continuum and the lines in the broad line region . since the cores of ( u)lirgs are so dusty , the broad line regions are too obscured to view .    obtaining data at spatial resolutions sufficiently high to resolve inside the sphere of influence of a supermassive black hole at the typical redshifts of local ( u)lirgs ( @xmath8 ) requires adaptive optics systems , which are becoming available at an increasing number of ground - based observatories .",
    "though the hubble space telescope has excellent resolution in the visible bands , its relatively small mirror size limits the resolution at the longer wavelengths ( @xmath9 m ) necessary to look through the dust in these galactic nuclei ; even at the longest wavelength available to the wide field camera 3 ( @xmath10-band ) , these nuclei are still sometimes obscured . in order to achieve high spatial resolution in @xmath11-band ,",
    "large ground - based telescopes have employed adaptive optics systems which measure turbulence in the earth s atmosphere and use a deformable mirror to correct for the resulting distortions .",
    "these distortion measurements require references , either a natural guide star ( ngs ao ) or a laser guide star plus a fainter natural `` tip - tilt '' star ( lgs ao ) .",
    "the addition of laser guide star adaptive optics has increased the area of the sky observable with this technique .    throughout this paper",

    "[ obs ] we present our data and reduction techniques . in  [ kinematicfitting ]",
    "we briefly describe the kinematic fitting techniques demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite . in  [ results ] we present the black hole masses measured from several tracers and in  [ scalingrelations ] compare them to black hole scaling relations .",
    " [ conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we have selected 9 gas - rich merging galaxies in which to measure the black hole masses using gas and stellar kinematics .",
    "these galaxies represent the subset of merging galaxies presented in @xcite for which high quality kinematics data exist .",
    "the parent sample was drawn from the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which targeted about two hundred of the brightest infrared galaxies in the sky ( log(l@xmath16/l@xmath1 ) @xmath17 11.0 ) .",
    "our targets were selected from that sample for the following criteria : available archival @xmath18- and @xmath19-band imaging from the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ; visible double or extended cores or clumps in the central five arcseconds ( within our field of view ) ; large - scale morphology consistent with that of a major merger ; observable from keck observatory and with an appropriate guide star ( @xmath20 18th magnitude in @xmath21 , @xmath22  separation ) .",
    "our sample comprises ( u)lirgs involved in major gas - rich galaxy mergers , with a bias towards later stages of merging .",
    "these galaxies are nearby , with redshifts @xmath23 , which is required to achieve spatial resolutions of @xmath24 pc per pixel ( @xmath25 pc per resolution element ) .",
    "we obtained near - infrared integral field spectroscopy of the central kiloparsec of 9 merging galaxies with osiris , the oh - suppressing infrared imaging spectrograph @xcite on the w.  m. keck i ( after august 2012 ) and ii ( before august 2012 ) 10-meter telescopes .",
    "all data presented here uses the 0.035 arcsec spaxel@xmath13 plate scale .",
    "this high spatial resolution is enabled by the keck observatory lgs ao system @xcite .",
    "our osiris observations were typically comprised of observing sets of object - sky - object ; each exposure was ten minutes ( 5 minutes for keck i observations ) .",
    "observations were taken either in the broad - band @xmath11 filter ( kbb : 1.965 - 2.381 @xmath26 m ) or in a narrow band targeting specific lines ( hn4 : 1.652 - 1.737 @xmath26 m ; kn5 : 2.292 - 2.408 @xmath26 m ) . when possible , the primary target lines were the co ( 2 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 1 ) bandheads at 2.293 @xmath26 m and 2.323 @xmath26 m in @xmath11 , which trace the kinematics of young stars . when available , we compare the stellar kinematics to those of various emission lines : [ fe ii ]  1.644 @xmath26 m , br@xmath27  2.16 @xmath26 m , h@xmath28  2.12 @xmath26 m .",
    "for some galaxies , stellar kinematics were not available because the co bandheads are redshifted out of @xmath11 , and we rely on the aforementioned emission lines for this analysis .",
    "total exposure times , observed filters , and parameters of the observed galaxies are listed in table  [ tbl : observingparams ] .",
    "some of these data were presented in previous papers @xcite , these are indicated in table  [ tbl : observingparams ] as well .",
    "we reduced our keck ii observations using the osiris data reduction pipeline version 2.3 ( using the updated osiris wavelength solution for data taken after october 2009 ) and our keck i observations using version 3 .",
    "this pipeline includes modules to subtract sky frames , adjust channel levels , remove crosstalk , identify glitches , clean cosmic rays , extract a spectrum for each spatial pixel , assemble the spectra into a data cube , correct for atmospheric dispersion , perform telluric corrections , and mosaic frames together .",
    "for some cases we utilized the scaled sky subtraction module based on the technique outlined in @xcite , which scales the thermal continuum and oh line groups separately to provide optimal sky subtraction ; we modified the module to include a smoother subtraction of the thermal continuum , as described in @xcite .",
    "we imaged the tip - tilt stars for each galaxy during the course of the observations in order to obtain an estimate of the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "a moffat function was fit to each tip - tilt star and then broadened according to the distance between the target and the tip - tilt star .",
    "this broadening accounts for the fact that the laser spot is not at infinity ; therefore it only probes most of the turbulence that affects the target . as a result ,",
    "the further a target is from its tip - tilt star , the worse its psf will be .",
    "the isokinetic angle for the keck ii ao system , at which the strehl ratio is reduced to 37% of its peak value , is approximately 75 arcseconds .",
    "we also use this an estimate of the keck i ao system performance , which has not yet been characterized .",

    "we measured the kinematics following the methods presented in detail in ( * ? ? ? * for stellar kinematics ) and ( * ? ? ? * for emission line kinematics ) , and reviewed again in @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe these techniques here .    for each measurement , we first calculate the signal - to - noise ratio in each pixel and bin them using optimal voronoi tesselations @xcite in order to require a certain signal - to - noise ratio for reliable measurements .",
    "we used thresholds of 20 and 3 per resolution element for stellar kinematics and emission line kinematics , respectively .",

    "our black hole mass measurement techniques have been demonstrated in two prior papers . in @xcite , we place limits on the mass of the black hole in the south nucleus of ngc  6240 using 2-d stellar kinematic maps and two methods . we calculate the lower limit to the mass by assuming the stars lie in a thin keplerian disk , and fit a density profile including a black hole and a smoothly - varying spheroidal mass component : @xmath30 .",
    "because of the high spatial resolution of our data , we probe radii small enough that the first term dominates over the second .",
    "the measured black hole mass here is a lower limit because this method ignores velocity dispersion ( assuming that all measured velocity dispersion is due to material along the line of sight , not intrinsic to the disk ) .",
    "any intrinsic velocity dispersion in the disk will be indicative of extra mass in the black hole . in the second scenario",
    ", we obtain an upper limit on the black hole mass by assuming the opposite : that all measured velocity dispersion is intrinsic to the disk . because the system is unrelaxed , there is unvirialized material along the line of sight increasing the velocity dispersion but not knowing about the central black hole mass . to find this limit ,",
    "we use jeans axisymmetric mass models ( jam ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use both methods here for all galaxies with measured stellar kinematics , except for the north black hole in ngc  6240 .",
    "this nucleus contains patchy dust that prevents a consistent light profile from being produced by the jam models ; in order to use this measurement technique on that black hole , equivalently high resolution imaging at a longer wavelength ( @xmath31-band or beyond ) is required .    in @xcite",
    ", we measure the mass of the black hole in the north nucleus of mrk273 in a similar manner .",
    "since no stellar kinematics were available , the jam models were not feasible .",
    "when only gas kinematics are available , we model the gas as a thin keplerian disk and proceed as in the first case above .",
    "the black hole mass measured for this galaxy agrees well with the measurement made using the kinematics of an oh maser @xcite , and therefore provides independent justification for this technique .",
    "we note that the thin keplerian disk approximation provides reasonable @xmath32 agreement to the maser measurement even though the disks analyzed in @xcite are thick rather than thin , with @xmath331 - 4 .",
    "we note that this thickness may cause our black hole mass measurements to underestimate the true black hole mass by up to @xmath34% .    with this approach",
    ", we are measuring the unresolved central mass within @xmath35 parsecs .",
    "this is likely dominated by the black hole , and we therefore refer to it as such .",
    "however , this mass includes the accretion disk of the black hole and may include a reservoir of gas feeding the accretion disk . if the accretion disk is fueled smoothly by the nuclear disk , this mass will be accounted for by the radial profile ; we can not account for a pile - up of gas below our resolution limit .",
    "the possible implications for this will be discussed further in section  [ scalingrelations ] .    in each case , errors on the black hole mass measurement were obtained using a monte carlo approach .",
    "we created a model datacube and added random noise appropriate to the signal - to - noise of each spectrum and then refit the black hole mass for 100 iterations .",
    "the width of the resulting mass distribution is the error on the measurement .",

    "the ability to measure black hole masses using different tracers , and additionally to use bracketing assumptions about velocity dispersion for stellar models , improves the robustness of these results .",
    "the numerical results from our black hole mass measurements are listed in table  [ tbl : mbh ] , along with parameters relevant to black hole scaling relations , pulled from the literature : the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge , the stellar mass of the bulge , and the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "though consistent treatment of such parameters when drawing from different literature sources is difficult , care was taken to select measurements most appropriate to the scaling relation .",
    "the bulge luminosities and total stellar masses were taken from the goals papers @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite measured the bulge luminosities using galfit @xcite to decompose @xmath10-band nicmos images into multiple srsic components .",
    "these galaxies are morphologically complex , which can produce an increased uncertainty in bulge fit parameters ; thus , the errors in bulge luminosities reported by @xcite and reproduced in table  [ tbl : mbh ] may be larger than the equivalent measurements from hubble imaging of isolated galaxies .",
    "it is worth considering that we use the formal statistical errors produced by galfit ; the analysis of @xcite has shown that these underestimate the true errors , which can contain contributions from profile mismatch and nearby neighbors , both relevant to our sample .",
    "however , @xcite also find that galfit shows no systematic offset to fitting bulge luminosities of bright objects and that it is able to appropriately handle contamination by neighbors when fit simultaneously ( as was done in * ? ? ?",

    "our total stellar masses were measured from seds using photometry masks @xcite designed to incorporate all of the light from the galaxy .",

    "although we note that these are not outliers in a statistical sense , we must be certain that they are not unfairly biasing our results . because our sample for each scaling relation has only 8 points , throwing out these two galaxies has a significant effect in all cases through reducing the sample size .",
    "we note , however : when removing the two galaxies from the @xmath4 relation , the measured offset decreases quite a bit , while the uncertainty in the offset also increases ( producing only a 1.9-@xmath100 result ) . for the other two relations ,",
    "the measured offset decreases only slightly , and the main effect is an increase in uncertainty ( so the significance still decreases from 3.3-@xmath100 to 2.3-@xmath100 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the offsets are nt driven by these two galaxies in the @xmath94 and @xmath95 relations .    due to the small sizes of our samples , the appropriate way to deal with potential outliers is to use the balanced bootstrap test , which we have done .",

    "the black holes in this sample of gas - rich major mergers consistently fall on or above the scaling relations for passive galaxies with stellar velocity dispersion , bulge luminosity and total stellar mass .",
    "although a number of our galaxies lie within the scatter of these scaling relations , our statistical tests show they are significantly more likely to fall on the upper side of the scatter than randomly distributed about the relations . though the offset from the @xmath4 relation is only a 2.6-sigma result , the agreement with the two other significant relations lends it confidence .",
    "taken together , these results show that increased black hole growth in these mergers has already begun and may be proceeding more rapidly than growth of the host galaxy .",
    "although we have a relatively small sample of black holes , it is striking that we already see a significant offset .",
    "as more black hole masses are measured in gas - rich mergers , the larger sample will provide a more accurate picture of how offset such systems are from black hole scaling relations .",
    "we caution the reader against considering the distance from a scaling relation as a direct proxy for merger stage .",
    "this is clearly evident when comparing where a system falls on one scaling relation versus another .",
    "for example , irasf17207 - 0014 falls closer to the @xmath4 relation than to the @xmath84 relation ; for ngc  6240s , the reverse is true .",
    "this discrepancy could be caused by at least two possible mechanisms : 1 ) the host galaxy parameters trace different aspects of galaxy growth , which may evolve differently . for example",
    ", the bulge velocity dispersion traces a convolution of mass growth with the virialization timescale whereas the bulge luminosity evolution may rely less stringently on the dynamical relaxation time .",
    "2 ) as discussed above , the simulations of @xcite show that the measured stellar velocity dispersion of similar mergers oscillates during the course of the merger .",
    "analogous simulations would have to be performed for bulge luminosity and total stellar mass measurements to determine if they ought to oscillate as well .",
    "even if all three quantities were expected to oscillate during a merger , it seems contrived to require that they oscillate in lockstep . to determine precisely how galaxies evolve along a scaling relation ( and if they evolve the same way along each scaling relation )",
    ", a larger sample of systems is required . by binning over merger stage",
    ", the range of distances from scaling relations can be seen , and key parameters affecting this can be identified .",
    "we leave this analysis for future studies .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss several plausibility arguments related to the above results .",
    "we consider the growth timescales and the available fuel for both black holes and the host galaxies .",
    "we posit that these systems followed black hole scaling relations before the merger began and that , since then , mass has been funneled to the center to enable black hole growth . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that each galaxy previously fell precisely on every scaling relation ; of course , as each relation contains intrinsic scatter , this is unlikely .",
    "however , we have no reason to believe that these systems were systematically offset from scaling relations before the mergers began , and thus this simplification should average out in the order - of - magnitude calculations of this and the following sections .    with that assumption , we consider how long it would take for a black hole , growing at the eddington rate , to reach this far beyond its original mass . in table",
    "[ tbl : eddrate ] , we calculate this for our sample of galaxies .",
    "we see that the required times for these black holes to grow , while accreting at the eddington rate , are a few tens to hundreds of millions of years . as",
    "this is less than or comparable to a merger timescale , it is reasonable that these systems could have lain on scaling relations before the merger , and risen only after the merger began . as black hole growth",
    "is known to be episodic , we note that these systems could often have been accreting at sub - eddington rates for timescales less than those noted , and that the accretion times need not have been continuous .",
    "the merger of one of these objects , ngc  2623 , has been modeled by @xcite using h i kinematics from the very large array .",

    "we also repeat that our black hole mass measurements produce dynamical masses of a central point source , which to our spatial resolution could be anything smaller than @xmath34pc .",
    "it is therefore plausible that some of the mass measured is in the accretion disk ( or , perhaps , in a nearby reservoir feeding the accretion disk ) . if that s the case , any mass that has not accreted directly onto the black hole would not cause the black hole to turn on as an agn . in such a scenario ,",

    "although the existence of agn confirms that accretion can occur on shorter timescales , the delay may not be negligible .",
    "this allows for the possibility that gas can build up in the core of a galaxy around the black hole without having yet been accreted . this accretion disk ( and ,",
    "possibly , a reservoir feeding the accretion disk ) of gas could contain a substantial amount of mass en route to the black hole .",
    "this mass would all appear as a point source to our dynamical models .",
    "given the scaling arguments in the sections above , we also note the possibility that this putative accreting gas may never make it to the black hole .",
    "although the black hole dominates the gravitational pull on this gas , we find it plausible that when the black hole begins to accrete , its feedback may blow some of the rest of the gas away . thus , the extra mass that we see here could be the reservoir for massive outflows seen in a variety of local agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we note , however , that the black hole masses from which the scaling relations were calibrated did not have sufficient resolution to separate out remnant disks on 1 - 10 parsec scales either ; thus we only introduce a bias if our sample is more likely to host such disks than the typical galaxy .",
    "we note that such remnant disks were discovered in galaxy merger simulations but that they did not form until after the final coalescence of the two nuclei .",
    "thus it is not clear whether we would expect such disks ( broken from the larger nuclear disk on hundred parsec scales ) to be present in our sample .",
    "though the above possibilities may moderate the black hole masses measured by attributing some mass to other features , we still conclude that the black holes ( combined with their accretion disks ) in this sample of gas - rich mergers do not lie below black hole scaling relations , and in many cases are significantly more massive than their host galaxy properties would predict .",
    "this is directly opposite the predictions of quasar - mode feedback theories , in which black hole growth is delayed until the final stages of the galaxy merger when it cuts off star formation .",
    "as we note that ( u)lirgs are prototypically expected to evolve into quasars @xcite , we find this as further evidence of some delay in feedback timescale during a merger .",

    "it is not unreasonable to imagine that such different types of mergers would have different effects on their central black holes .",
    "for example , a minor or gas - poor merger might use up all incoming new gas in star formation before it reaches the central black hole , causing a delay in black hole accretion until stellar feedback produces new gas to fuel it .",
    "a major gas - rich merger may have sufficient gas inflow to enable both star formation and black hole growth to begin relatively early .",
    "a sample of black holes in submillimeter galaxies appear to fall below the locally - defined @xmath96 relation by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are thought to be the high - redshift ( z@xmath108 ) counterparts of local ulirgs and therefore might be reasonable to expect that they would behave in the same way as the sample presented here .",
    "however , the discrepancy may in fact be due to their usage of broad line velocity dispersions to infer @xmath32 ; indeed , when applying the same method in one local ulirg , @xcite find rough agreement with their submillimeter galaxies .",
    "it is also possible that differences between the samples such as eddington ratio , redshift , and merger stage might affect the black hole growth timescales .",
    "we have presented high spatial resolution near - infrared integral field spectroscopy of nuclear disks in nearby merging ( u)lirgs .",
    "these gas - rich mergers funnel gas to the galaxy centers where the gas forms disks ; stars then form _ in situ _ , creating a stellar disk as well .",
    "these disks , which were described in detail in @xcite , provide an alternative method to measuring black hole masses .",
    "three - integral orbital superposition models rely on an assumption of virialization and emission line black hole mass diagnostics require broad lines ; neither of these methods is feasible in such systems .",
    "however , with adaptive optics , we have produced two - dimensional kinematic maps at spatial resolutions close to or better than radius of the sphere of influence of the black hole . because the dynamical timescale this close to a black hole is short ,",
    "the material quickly becomes virialized , and kinematic modeling is possible .",
    "we implemented two different techniques using these kinematic maps , originally presented in @xcite and @xcite , to measure 9 new black hole masses , producing a sample of black hole masses in 9 merging systems . by obtaining both gas and stellar kinematics for many of these systems , we are able to provide multiple independent measurements for a large fraction of our sample .",
    "gaseous disks are modeled as thin keplerian disks .",
    "stellar disks are more likely to have pressure support , but measuring this is not straightforward , so we place bracketing measurements using two assumptions . to provide a lower limit to the black hole mass , we assume the stars are also in a thin keplerian disk ; any pressure support would increase the black hole mass .",
    "we also use jeans axisymmetric mass models to take into account the velocity dispersion ; since this velocity dispersion may be inflated by intervening unvirialized material along the line of sight , this mass measurement is an upper limit .",
    "as the black hole masses measured here are in fact masses enclosed in @xmath34pc , some of the mass attributed to black holes here may be gas that has not yet accreted onto the black hole .",
    "although this mass is gravitationally bound to the black holes , we note that it is possible that future agn - driven outflows may carry a fraction of it away , thus diminishing the final black hole mass .",
    "though such outflows have now been seen in a number of ( u)lirgs , further studies will reveal how frequently they occur , how much mass they carry , and how much of the loaded mass comes from within @xmath34pc .",
    "we have placed these enclosed masses on three local black hole scaling relations , @xmath4 , @xmath84 , and @xmath95 , using host galaxy parameters from the literature .",
    "we find that though individual galaxies often fall within the scatter , as a population they are significantly offset towards higher black hole masses than isolated systems .",
    "several systems have central masses that sit considerably above scaling relations .    under the assumption that these galaxies follow black hole scaling relations before and after their mergers",

    "one key feature of our thin disk black hole mass models is the inclusion of a radially - varying mass component to incorporate the mass profile of the nuclear disk .",
    "( our jam models also incorporate galactic mass , but by fitting a mass - to - light ratio . )",
    "we note that our fits use only a single power - law fit to the mass profile , so any pile - up of matter below our resolution limit will be considered part of the point mass .",
    "we include the mass profiles measured here for completeness , and for the purposes of calculating the implied radius of the sphere of influence of each black hole .",
    "recall that the mass profile is fit with the form @xmath111 . in table",
    "[ tbl : disks ] we report the normalization and power law fit for each of these parameters . for clarity , instead of reporting @xmath112 , we report the mass in the disk enclosed at 100 parsecs .",
    "a black hole s sphere of influence is defined as the region within which the black hole contributes 50% of the mass .",
    "we can therefore use our thin disk mass profiles to calculate the radius of the implied sphere of influence .",
    "this is interesting both for the purposes of understanding black hole dynamics and for confirming that we indeed have sufficient resolution to measure the black hole masses appropriately .",
    "as the fitted mass profiles of the disk and black hole masses are not independent , there is an issue of covariance to consider .",
    "that is , when a model fits a higher black hole mass , it will likely put less mass in the disk , and vice versa .",
    "when calculating errors on each of these parameters , we marginalize over the others : our black hole mass errors are calculated from the width of the black hole mass distribution in our monte carlo simulation , taking into account all possible fitted disk profiles .",
    "similarly , we report our errors on disk profile parameters using the widths of the distributions taking into account all fitted black hole masses .",
    "this is an appropriate way to handle covariance when drawing conclusions about the black hole masses , as is done in this paper . to account for the covariance issue in the measurement of @xmath113",
    ", we calculate @xmath113 for every fit in the monte carlo simulation and draw our conclusions based on that .    in one case ( irasf01364 - 1042 ) , the black hole mass is comparable or larger than the entire nuclear disk .",
    "the calculated radius of influence is thus artificially large , because presumably the mass profile of the galaxy changes beyond our field of view .",
    "the h@xmath28  fit to iiizw035 is also artificially large ; we attribute this to streaming motion in the h@xmath28  emission compromising the larger scale fit .",
    "this and other evidence of outflows will be presented in an upcoming paper .",
    "the affected radii are reported in parentheses in table  [ tbl : disks ] .",
    "we see that , for our sample , we clearly resolve the spheres of influence of these black holes .",
    "we note that this method of calculating the size of the sphere of influence is uncommon , as a full mass profile is required to determine where @xmath114 .",
    "our capacity to resolve these scales exceeded our expectations because the black holes are more massive than predicted .",
