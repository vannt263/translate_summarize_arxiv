    "optimal control theory has become one of the most dominant and indispensable techniques for analyzing dynamical systems in which optimal decisions are sought at each moment . surely , the principal part in the establishment of the theory as an important and rich area of applied mathematics arises in the strong utilization of the subject area in a great breadth of applications and research areas such as engineering , computer science , astronautics , biological sciences , chemistry , agriculture , business , management , energy , path planning problems , and a host of many other areas ; cf .",
    "@xcite .    the most popular analytical methods for solving optimal control problems such as the calculus of variations , pontryagin s principle , and bellman s principle , can generally solve only fairly simple problems .",
    "however , such methods are largely deficient to handle the increasing complexity of optimal control problems since the advent of digital computers , which led to a revolution in the development of numerical dynamic optimization methods over the past few decades . among the popular numerical methods for solving optimal control problems , the so - called `` direct orthogonal collocation methods '' and `` direct pseudospectral methods '' have become two of the most universal and well established numerical dynamic optimization methods due to many merits they offer over other competitive methods in the literature ; cf .",
    "@xcite . both classes of numerical dynamic optimization methods convert the continuous optimal control problem into a finite dimensional constrained optimization problem based on the elegant spectral and pseudospectral methods , which are known to furnish exponential / spectral convergence rates faster than any polynomial convergence rate when the problem exhibits sufficiently smooth solutions ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "direct hp - pseudospectral methods were specifically designed to handle optimal control problems with discontinuous or nonsmooth states and controls ; cf .",
    "such methods generally recover the prominent exponential convergence rates of pseudospectral methods by dividing the solution domain into an increasing number of mesh intervals and increasing the degree of the polynomial interpolant within each mesh interval .",
    "in particular , a local @xmath0-refinement is a suitable technique on regions where the solution is smooth , while a local @xmath1-refinement is preferable on elements where the solution is discontinuous / nonsmooth . to avoid high computational costs , adaptive strategies strive to control the locations of mesh intervals , minimize their number , and answer the question of whether increasing the number of collocation points within each mesh interval is necessary or not to achieve a certain accuracy threshold .    in the most general formulation of an hp finite element method ,",
    "the solution over each element is approximated by an arbitrary degree polynomial .",
    "the spectral element method uses instead a high - degree piecewise polynomial defined by an appropriate set of interpolation nodes or expansion modes . to achieve the highest interpolation accuracy ,",
    "the interior interpolation nodes are distributed at positions corresponding to the zeros of certain families of orthogonal polynomials ; cf . @xcite .",
    "while direct hp - pseudospectral methods were thoroughly investigated in the past few years , comparable literature for direct adaptive spectral element methods for solving special classes of optimal control problems is rather very few , and to the best of our knowledge , it seems that such methods do not exist for solving more general nonlinear optimal control problems .",
    "we acknowledge though the existence of some posteriori error analyses of hp finite element approximations of special forms of convex optimal control problems ; cf .",
    "posteriori error estimates for the spectral element approximation of a linear quadratic optimal control problem in one dimension was recently presented by @xcite .",
    "however , all three papers lacked any adaptive strategies to efficiently implement their numerical schemes .",
    "perhaps , the earliest and sole adaptive spectral element method for solving a special class of optimal control problems described by a quadratic cost functional and linear advection - diffusion state equation was put forward by @xcite . in their presented work , an approximate saddle point of the lagrangian functional",
    "is sought by iterating on the karush - kuhn - tucker optimality conditions to seek their satisfaction numerically using a galerkin spectral element method for the space discretization .",
    "the adaptive algorithm relies on a posteriori error estimate of the cost functional , from which the parameters of the spectral element discretization are selected .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to derive high - order numerical solutions of nonlinear optimal control problems exhibiting smooth / nonsmooth solutions using a novel direct adaptive gegenbauer integral spectral element ( gise ) method . in particular",
    ", the proposed method converts the nonlinear optimal control problem into an integral multiple - phase optimal control problem .",
    "the multiple - phases are then connected using state continuity linkage conditions with easily incorporated control continuity linkage conditions when the control functions are assumed continuous .",
    "the numerical discretization is carried out using truncated shifted gegenbauer series expansions and a novel numerical quadrature defined on each mesh interval henceforth called the @xmath2th elemental shifted optimal barycentric gegenbauer quadrature ( kesobgq) based on the stable barycentric representation of lagrange interpolating polynomials .",
    "such a quadrature can produce excellent approximations while significantly reducing the number of operational costs required for the evaluation of the involved integrals .",
    "the proposed method is further invigorated by a novel adaptive strategy that uses a multicriterion for locating the mesh intervals where the state and control functions are smooth / nonsmooth based on information derived from the residual of the discrete dynamical system equations , and the magnitude of the last coefficients in the state and control truncated series .",
    "in fact , the idea of using the spectral coefficients of the state trajectories as a measure to verify the convergence of the computed solution was previously presented by @xcite . nonetheless , in this article",
    ", we shall exploit the spectral coefficients instead to check the smoothness of the approximate solutions on the interval of interest .",
    "the proposed method generally produces a small / medium - scale nonlinear programming problem that could be easily solved using the current powerful numerical optimization methods .",
    "the current paper casts further the light on the judicious choice of the shifted gegenbauer - gauss collocation points set to be utilized on each mesh interval during the discretization process of optimal control problems based on numerical simulations .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ps ] , we describe the optimal control problem statement under study . in section [ sec :",
    "tgsem ] , we present our novel gise method . a novel adaptive strategy is presented in section [ subsec : as1 ] . section [ subsec : err ] is devoted for the error analysis and convergence properties of the kesobgq . in section [ sec : ne ] , two test examples of nonlinear optimal control problems are included to demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed gise method followed by some concluding remarks illustrating the advantages of the proposed gise method in section [ conc ] .",
