    "the problem of compactifying the ( generalized ) jacobian of curves or of families of curves has been widely studied in the last decades , starting from the work of igusa @xcite and of mayer and mumford @xcite .",
    "the first solution to this problem , in the case on irreducible curves , was due to dsouza in @xcite and since then , several other solutions where found , the more general one being probably simpson s construction of moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on projective schemes in @xcite ( see @xcite for an overview and comparison results on these constructions ) .    on the other hand , the construction of the moduli space of stable curves with marked points was done by knudsen in @xcite , following ideas of mumford , with the scope of proving the projectivity of the moduli space of stable curves . since then , @xmath1 itself became the subject of great interest , because of its rich geometry , and because of several applications . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 has a central role in gromov - witten theory and enumerative geometry .",
    "in fact , in part motivated by witten s conjecture ( @xcite ) , the study of the cohomology ring of @xmath9 attracted the attention of several mathematicians in the last decades and led to very important results .",
    "we recall , for instance , kontsevich s first proof of the witten conjecture in ( @xcite ) ; the interaction between geometry and physics leading to the development of quantum cohomoly and gromov - witten theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; the algebro - geometric inductive calculations on the cohomology ring of @xmath1 due to arbarello and cornalba in @xcite ; faber s conjectures on the structure of the tautological ring of @xmath10 and its pointed versions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the elsv formulas relating intersection formulas in @xmath1 with hurwitz numbers ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the recent proof by faber , shadrin and zvonkine in @xcite of the generalized witten conjecture ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , it is natural to search for a compactification of @xmath8 over @xmath1 and to study its applications .",
    "nevertheless , at least to our knowledge , there was no construction of compactified picard varieties for curves with marked points until now .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to construct an algebraic ( artin ) stack @xmath0 with a geometrically meaningful modular description , giving a solution for the above problem for @xmath2 .",

    "universal picard variety of degree @xmath4over @xmath13 parametrizing isomorphism classes of line bundles of degree @xmath4 over automorphism - free nonsingular curves .",
    "the problem of compactifying @xmath14 over @xmath15 was addressed by caporaso in @xcite and later by pandharipande in @xcite ( the second author s construction holds also for bundles of higher rank ) .",
    "both compactifications were done by means of git - quotients yielding projective varieties endowed with a proper map onto @xmath15 , extending the natural map @xmath16 .",
    "even if the boundary objects used by the two authors have different modular interpretations , it turns out that the resulting varieties coincide .",
    "we here focus on caporaso s original compactification , which works for @xmath2 ; denote it by @xmath17 and by @xmath18 its natural map onto @xmath15 .",

    "we considered the same problem in @xcite with no assumption on @xmath4 , getting an algebraic ( artin ) stack @xmath26 with a universally closed morphism @xmath27 onto @xmath25 parametrizing families of _ quasistable _ curves endowed with _ balanced _ line bundles of relative degree @xmath4 .",

    "morphisms between two such sections are given by cartesian diagrams of the families compatible with the sections plus an isomorphism between the line bundles ( see definition [ compstack ] ) .",

    "unfortunately , we do not know yet if our space supports such classes , except for what they call @xmath32-classes , which turn out to be the pullback of the @xmath32-classes in @xmath1 .",
    "it is certainly interesting to consider this as a future research problem .",
    "our construction of @xmath0 goes in the following way .",
    "for @xmath11 , we define @xmath33 to be equal to @xmath26 .",
    "then , for @xmath34 , along the lines of knudsen s construction of @xmath25 in @xcite , we show that there is an isomorphism between @xmath0 and the universal family over @xmath35 .",
    "this isomorphism is built explicitly and it generalizes knudsen s notion of _ contraction _ and _ stabilization _ of @xmath6-pointed stable curves , in this more general context of quasistable curves endowed with balanced line bundles .",
    "the stacks @xmath0 can never be deligne - mumford since there is an action of @xmath36 given by scalar product on the line bundles , leaving the curves and the sections fixed .",
    "even the rigidification in the sense of @xcite of @xmath0 by this action of @xmath36 , denoted by @xmath37 is not deligne - mumford in general .",
    "in fact , already for @xmath11 , it was proved by caporaso in @xcite that @xmath38 is deligne - mumford if and only if @xmath23 .",
    "this holds in general for any @xmath29 .    in order to make the contraction process work",
    ", we also need to prove some technical properties for balanced line bundles over quasistable pointed curves .",
    "in particular , we get general results concerning global and normal generation for line bundles on ( reducible ) nodal curves depending only on their multidegree ( see section [ technical ] ) .    in section [ forgetful ]",
    "we show that @xmath0 is endowed with a ( forgetful ) morphism @xmath39 onto @xmath9 .",
    "we also study the fibres of @xmath39 .",

    "we also study the map form @xmath44 to @xmath0 and its sections and we show that these yield cartier divisors on @xmath44 with interesting intersection properties .",
    "we would also like to observe that another possible approach to the construction of @xmath0 would be to use baldwin and swinarski s git construction of the moduli space of stable maps and , in particular , of @xmath45 , in @xcite , and then procede as caporaso in @xcite .",
