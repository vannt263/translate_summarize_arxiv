    "mott transitions in multiband scenarios have recently received increased attention in the condensed matter community , partly owing to the interests in materials related to the iron - based superconducting ( fesc ) materials , whose parent compounds are believed to be in close proximity to mott transitions.@xcite indeed , while most parent compounds of the fescs are poor metals , insulating behaviors have been observed in@xcite ( tl , k)fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and in@xcite la@xmath2o@xmath2fe@xmath2o(se , s)@xmath2 . given the sizable magnetic moment of approximately 0.81.0  @xmath3 in the parent compounds of the `` 122 '' family fescs,@xcite a persistent debate in the field has been whether the magnetism is best described by an itinerant spin - density - wave ( sdw ) nesting@xcite or a local - moment ( lm)@xcite picture . theoretically ,",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "lsda calculation@xcite is able to obtain the experimentally observed magnetic ordering pattern in these compounds , but the magnetic moment is overestimated to be approximately 2.0  @xmath3 , suggesting that a weak - coupling sdw picture alone may not be adequate in describing these materials .    with the above considerations , it is beneficial to consider how magnetism and fermi surface nesting affect the mott transition , and vice versa , in a multiband scenario .",
    "of particular interest is the question of whether there are any signs of local - moment physics on the metallic side of the phase diagram .",
    "however , while multiband mott transitions have previously been studied via dynamical mean - field theory @xcite and slave - spin mean - field,@xcite many of these studies have been focused on paramagnetic states .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we present a slave - rotor@xcite study of an orbital - symmetric multiband mott transition in which , utilizing a natural separation of scale between the orbital - symmetric coulomb repulsion and the hund s coupling , the sdw fermi surface nesting has been explicitly taken into account .",
    "we find that for a sizable range of hund s coupling , the existence of ( nearly ) nesting fermi surfaces causes the mott transition to acquire a strong first - order character , in which the ( staggered ) magnetization jumps across the phase boundary .",
    "however , as the strength of hund s coupling further increases , the first - order transition becomes weaker and an enhancement of magnetization can be observed on the metallic side .",
    "we interpret the former scenario as one in which a sharp distinction can be drawn between the itinerant sdw nesting and the lm picture , and the latter scenario as one in which signs of lm physics begin to develop in the metallic phase .",
    "it is worth noting that in the region of parameter space in which the staggered magnetization is enhanced , the renormalized hopping parameters also develop a discernible anisotropy between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 nearest - neighbor bonds , in which the antiferromagnetic @xmath4 direction shows a larger renormalized hopping than the ferromagnetic @xmath5 direction .",
    "such anisotropy is insignificant in other regions of the parameter space we considered . in the context of fesc",
    ", such anisotropy may be associated and is in agreement with the observed resistivity anisotropy in detwined ba(fe@xmath6co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 samples,@xcite in which the in - plane resistivity in the antiferromagnetic direction is found to be smaller than that in the ferromagnetic direction  a result difficult to reconcile with a simple landau fermi liquid picture.@xcite    we also remark that the renormalized bandwidth we obtained in this region of enhanced magnetization is about 2.55 times narrower than that of the corresponding noninteracting tight - binding model ",
    "values that are close to , albeit larger , than those reported for some fesc materials.@xcite similarly , the staggered magnetization in such region is around 1.31.5  @xmath3 , close to but slightly larger than the values observed in the fesc materials in the `` 122 '' family . together with the observed resistivity anisotropy ,",
    "it is tempting to suggest that some fesc materials in the `` 122 '' family are close to this region of enhanced magnetization that we associated with remnant of lm physics in the metallic phase .",
    "a multiband mott transition can be described by a multiband hubbard model , which can be written as the sum of a noninteracting hopping hamiltonian and an on - site interaction term : @xmath7 where @xmath8 label lattice sites , @xmath9 label orbitals , and @xmath10 label spins .",
    "note that the sum over repeated spin indices is assumed in the above equations and will be assumed throughout this paper .",
    "note also that we assume @xmath11 to be orbital independent , as would be case the when all orbitals are atomic . in that limit",
    ", it can also be shown@xcite that @xmath12 , which we shall assume henceforth and thus drop the subscripts .",
    "henceforth we shall also refer to the @xmath11 term as the coulomb interaction and the @xmath13 term as the hund s coupling , even though the latter includes the contributions from co - hopping and inter - orbital coulomb interactions .",
    "for concreteness we take @xmath14 to be the orbital - symmetric two - band hamiltonian introduced by ran _",
    "_ in ref .  , whose hopping parameters and fermi surface topology are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_hop ] .",
    "such hamiltonian is believed to capture certain essential physics in fescs , and in such context the two orbitals can be understood as the @xmath15 and @xmath16 orbital of the fe site , with the @xmath17 axes oriented in the fe layer and at 45@xmath18 with the fe  fe bond direction . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] , at half - filling ( i.e. , two electrons per site ) there is strong fermi surface nesting in @xmath14 , with nesting vector @xmath0 and @xmath19 , consistent with the sdw ordering in the@xcite `` 1111 '' and@xcite `` 122 '' families fescs .",
    "however , as explained in ref .  , for topological reasons the fermi surfaces are not fully gapped even when interactions are included ; hence there is a robust metallic sdw phase in such model .    in the slave - rotor formalism,@xcite",
    "the hilbert space is enlarged by decomposing the electron operator @xmath20 into an @xmath21 rotor @xmath22 and a fermionic spinon @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 .",
    "note that in such decomposition there is only one rotor per lattice site and the spin and orbital indices are carried solely by @xmath25 .",
    "such economy in the slave - rotor formalism is made possible by the orbital - symmetric structure of the hubbard hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : h_hb ] , particularly in the existence of a large orbital - symmetric coulomb interaction @xmath11 . in this enlarged hilbert space ,",
    "the physical subspace is given by the constraint @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the angular momentum operator conjugate to @xmath22 .",
    "plugging the slave - rotor decomposition into the hubbard hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : h_hb ] , and applying a mean - field approximation to decouple the spinon @xmath25 and the rotor @xmath28 , we obtain : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are mean - field parameters introduced to enforce the constraint on average , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , all of which are to be determined self - consistently . in this paper",
    "we consider only translationally invariant solutions in which the rotor unit cell is unenlarged while the spinon unit cell is enlarged to include two lattice sites per cell .",
    "moreover , since the underlying hamiltonian is time - reversal invariant , we consider only solutions for which both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are real .",
    "furthermore , since the system is at half - filling , the constraint is satisfied by setting @xmath35 . in this paper ,",
    "the self - consistency for @xmath34 and @xmath33 are solved by repeated iterations .",
    "following florens and georges,@xcite a second mean - field approximation is applied to the rotor hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : h_theta ] , in which the rotor variable @xmath36 is replaced by a complex bosonic field @xmath37 subjected to the constraint @xmath38 , enforced on average by a second mean - field parameter @xmath39 . with such approximation the rotor hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : h_theta ] reduces to a system of coupled simple harmonic oscillators .",
    "the electron quasiparticle weight in this formulation is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the dispersion of the @xmath42 boson in @xmath43 space .",
    "the system is in the metallic phase when @xmath44 , which happens when the @xmath42 boson condenses at its energy minimum .    for the spinon sector , we apply mean - field factorization to the four - fermion terms that appear in the spinon hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : h_f ] .",
    "specifically , given the fermi surface nesting , we consider the following sdw mean - field hamiltonian : @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the @xmath4 coordinate of site @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is a hermitian matrix of mean - field parameters , to be determined for given @xmath34 by minimizing @xmath49 with respect to the mean - field state obtained from @xmath50 . note that since @xmath48 carries orbital indices , the possibility of an orbital symmetry broken sdw state is included in our mean - field ansatz .",
    "since the @xmath50 breaks the symmetry between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 direction in the underlying hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : h_hb ] , the self - consistent mean - field parameters @xmath33 and @xmath51 can take different values along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 direction .",
    "we have also allowed for the possibility in which @xmath33 and @xmath51 take different values along the @xmath52 and @xmath53 directions , but found no manifestation of such cases in the parameter space we considered .",
    "it is well - noted that different parts of the electron two - body interactions are treated differently in our formulation , with the coulomb interaction @xmath11 handled via a `` strong - coupling '' approach while the hund s coupling @xmath13 handled via a `` weak - coupling '' approach .",
    "while this may seem unsatisfactory at first sight , it may nonetheless capture the qualitative aspects of the system when @xmath11 is the dominant scale , which seems to hold true for 3d transition metals@xcite and has been assumed in other theoretical calculations involving fescs@xcite .",
    "in this section we present the results of the mean - field calculations outlined in sec .",
    "[ sect : formulation ] for the half - filled orbital - symmetric two - band hubbard hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : h_hb ] , without worrying about the validity of the approximations made .",
    "we shall return to the issue of validity in sec .",
    "[ sect : discussions ] . to simplify notations , we measure both @xmath13 and @xmath11 in units of @xmath54 ( for comparison , note that the full bandwidth of the noninteracting hamiltonian eq .",

    "[ eq : h_f ] as the renormalized hopping hamiltonian .",
    "we also denote the orbital - dependent staggered magnetization as @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 ( here @xmath62 is the number of lattice sites ) , and decompose it as @xmath63 ) , with @xmath64 being the pauli sigma matrices .",

    "here p stands for paramagnetic metal , sdw stands for spin density wave metal , lm stands for antiferromagnetic insulator , and sl stands for spin liquid .",
    "the insulating region is indicated by the gray shade , and first - order phase boundaries are indicated by the yellow shade . for an explanation of the `` nnn decoupling '' and `` nn decoupling '' lines , see fig .",
    "[ fig : decoupling ] and the main text . ]",
    "our major result is the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] , in which we vary @xmath13 and @xmath11 while keeping the bare hopping parameters @xmath65 fixed . to provide further insight into the phase diagram , we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : j_cuts ] the quasiparticle weight @xmath66 , the bond renormalization factor @xmath58 along the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and diagonal ( @xmath67 ) direction , and the orbital - diagonal staggered magnetization @xmath68 as function of @xmath11 for four characteristic values of @xmath13 .",
    "it should be noted that within the parameter range we considered , the orbital - dependent staggered magnetization @xmath60 is always dominated by the orbital - diagonal component @xmath68 , in agreement with the weak - coupling results in ref .  .",
    "in other words , no tendency towards an orbital - selective sdw state is found in our results .",
    "because of this , henceforth we shall consider exclusively @xmath68 , and refer to it simply as the staggered magnetization .    as typified by fig .",
    "[ fig : j=0.4 ] , for @xmath69 we find that the system undergoes a second - order mott transition before developing any magnetism .",
    "the character of the mott transition is essentially the same as the one considered by florens and georges in ref .  .",
    "as a result , for small values of @xmath13 part of the parameter space supports a non - magnetic insulating state , i.e. , a spin liquid .",
    "interestingly , the onset of magnetism for this parameter range seems to coincide with a phase boundary ( labeled as `` nn decoupling '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ) in which the nearest - neighbor bonds renormalize to zero .    as @xmath13 increases to @xmath70 , the onset of magnetism begins to shift to the left of the mott transition .",
    "moreover , the first - order boundary in which the nearest - neighbor bonds renormalize to zero starts to coincide with the mott transition .",
    "the combined transition retains a first - order character , and the staggered magnetization exhibits a discontinuity across the transition .",
    "furthermore , another phase boundary in which the _ next_-nearest - neighbor bonds also renormalize to zero ( labeled as `` nnn decoupling '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ) can now be seen , whose critical value @xmath71 decreases with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "note that the phase boundary of this next - nearest - neighbor decoupling traces well with the onset of a fully polarized insulating state .",
    "this situation is typified in fig .",
    "[ fig : j=0.8 ] . for clarity",
    ", we also illustrate the real - space picture of the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor decoupled state in fig .",
    "[ fig : decoupling ] .",
    "as @xmath13 further increases to @xmath72 , the mott transition becomes even stronger in first - order character and starts to coincide with the transition in which the next - nearest - neighbor bonds decouple .",
    "the phase transition is now accompanied by a jump to full polarization across the phase boundary .",
    "this situation is typified in fig .",
    "[ fig : j=1.2 ] .",
    "however , as @xmath13 further increases to @xmath73 , the first - order character of the mott transition starts to soften up , and , as typified by fig .",
    "[ fig : j=2.2 ] , a small shoulder in which the staggered magnetization is enhanced can now be observed immediately to the left of the mott transition .",
    "moreover , as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : j=2.2 ] , an anisotropy of bond renormalization factors between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 nearest - neighbor bonds has also become discernible in this region where staggered magnetization is enhanced .",
    "in contrast , such anisotropy remains insignificant in all other parts of the parameter space we considered , including regions in the metallic phase in which the staggered magnetization is not enhanced .",
    "note also that the bond renormalization factor is larger in the antiferromagnetic @xmath4 direction than in the ferromagnetic @xmath5 direction .",
    "since the results in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] rely on various mean - field approximations , one should be cautious about the results thus obtained .",
    "in particular :    1 .   the critical value of @xmath11 for the mott transition , @xmath74 , obtained in the slave - rotor approach is smaller than that obtained in the slave - spin approach.@xcite this is a known discrepancy between the two methods and should vanish in the large-@xmath75 ( number of orbitals ) limit . for the case where @xmath75 is finite",
    "the slave - spin estimate is believed to be more accurate.@xcite this , however , should not affect the qualitative statements made in this paper .",
    "2 .   in the slave - rotor formalism , all bonds that connect between the same sites are renormalized by the same factor , regardless of orbital character . this may lead to worries that some orbital selective aspects@xcite of the system are neglected .",
    "such worries are partially alleviated by the study@xcite of a similar two - band system in the slave - spin formalism , which allows for the possibility of spin - and - orbital dependent bond renormalizations and finds no evidence for an orbital selective state for @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , we reiterate that the possibility of an orbital symmetry broken sdw state is included in our formulation via an orbital - dependent mean - field parameter @xmath48 , but that we always find the staggered magnetization of the resulting state to be dominated by the orbital - diagonal component . therefore , while orbital - selective scenarios have been proposed in the context of fescs,@xcite we have found no supporting evidence for such state in the two - band model we considered .",
    "3 .   as explained in sec .",
    "[ sect : formulation ] , the distinct treatment for the coulomb interaction and hund s coupling is justified by the assumption that @xmath11 is the dominant scale .",
    "generally , spin fluctuation is believed to play a more important role when the inter - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath77 is comparable to @xmath13 , i.e. , when @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath74 decreases rapidly as @xmath13 increases , the phase transition starts to enter the region where @xmath78 around @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the upper part of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] may be stretching the limit of validity for the present approach .",
    "4 .   by treating @xmath13 via a weak - coupling approach",
    ", we have neglected the strong - coupling aspect of the hund s coupling . in particular",
    ", one should not expect the @xmath74 to remain unchanged for small @xmath13 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] .",
    "instead , one should expect @xmath74 to drop immediately as @xmath13 increase , as is found@xcite in the slave - spin approach .",
    "5 .   in similar spirit",
    ", the present approximation has neglected the weak - coupling aspects of @xmath11 . in particular , at the perturbative level",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath13 are expected to drive the fermi surface nesting at @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the paramagnetic metal and the spin - liquid region in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] should , if exist at all , be greatly reduced in size .",
    ".   one peculiar feature of the mean - field result presented in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] is the existence of phases in which certain bonds in the hopping hamiltonian is renormalized to zero in the insulating phase .",
    "this seems to be a general feature of the slave - rotor method , since similar results is also found in a hubbard model with a different lattice geometry ( and which the hund s coupling is dropped).@xcite indeed , the problem can already be seen in the simplest case of a square - lattice hubbard model with non - mixing bands having only nearest - neighbor hoppings . in such case it can be checked that on the insulating side , within the slave - rotor mean field , a symmetry broken phase in which all bonds along a particular direction is renormalized to zero is energetically favorable to a state in which all bonds are renormalized by the same amount .",
    "this rotation - symmetry broken state is , in turn , less energetically favorable to a translation - and - rotation - symmetry broken state in which the bonds renormalize to a dimer pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ] for illustration ) . since the dimer pattern is known to be favorable in the large-@xmath75 limit,@xcite the decoupled phase in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] may be an artifact of the large-@xmath75 approximation .    in spite of the issues mentioned above",
    ", the present study may still shed light on the question we posed in the introduction of this paper : namely , whether there are any signs of local - moment physics on the metallic side of the phase diagram . for this , observe that @xmath74 remains in the region where @xmath80 for @xmath13 in the range @xmath81 , and as we approach the phase boundary from @xmath82 the bond renormalization remains modest for much of the parameter space , such that the renormalized bandwidth @xmath83 is at least comparable to @xmath13 . in such region the approximation we took in this paper may be valid . and for @xmath84 ,",
    "as we approach the phase boundary from @xmath82 there is no sign of magnetization enhancement ( which , in this formulation , will be accompanied by a sharper - than - usual drop in @xmath58 ) until the first - order phase boundary is hit .",
    "thus , our result is suggestive that in this range of @xmath13 there is no sign of local - moment physics on the metallic side .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath85 there is a sharper drop in @xmath58 as we approach the phase boundary , which suggests the possibility that in this range of @xmath13 some remnant of local - moment physics can be found .",
