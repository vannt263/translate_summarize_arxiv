    "quantum mechanical properties of physical systems make it possible to implement physically secure communication between distant parties , whereas it is impossible to achieve such a task only by the transmission of classical signals .",
    "an interesting and actively investigated problem of the so - called quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols is how to achieve the secret - key sharing using imperfect semi - classical signals and devices @xcite .",
    "one of the standard approaches is to implement photonic qubits by weak coherent states .",
    "qkd protocols have also been proposed based on quantum continuous - variable ( cv ) systems via coherent states @xcite .",
    "one of the central ideas in cv qkd is that the legitimate receiver ( bob ) of the signal measures one of the conjugate quadratures randomly , although an exception is found @xcite .",
    "there are two different types of cv - qkd protocols called postselection @xcite and reverse reconciliation ( rr ) . in the rr protocol @xcite , the sender ( alice ) of the signal infers the measurement results of bob to share the key .    in the classical picture ,",
    "an amplifier ( amp ) followed by a beam splitter ( bs ) provides perfect copies of the signal .",
    "thus an eavesdropper ( eve ) can obtain a perfect copy without making any disturbance on the signal .",
    "then , by repeating this process , eve can obtain arbitrary number of identical copies and characterize the signal with a desired resolution .",
    "in quantum theory , the amplification comes with spontaneous noise @xcite .",
    "thus the copies are imperfect and eve s intervention can be detected due to the disturbance .",
    "in addition to this , her knowledge about the signal is limited by the imperfection in the copies .    in cv systems ,",
    "the amp - followed - by - bs scheme provides an optimal gaussian @xmath0 cloning machine which makes the best approximate copies of gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the impossibility of the cloning is sometimes connected with the security of qkd .",
    "because a cloner makes a concrete example of eavesdropping attacks which always induces disturbance on the original system , one may think that the security against the best _ cloning attack _ is a good measure of qkd performance .",
    "however , the conditions of the optimal cloning and optimal eavesdropping attack are in general different .",
    "the optimal cloner provides two imperfect copies and one imperfect phase - conjugate - like state of the input called the _",
    "anticlone_. in the cloning attack , eve keeps one of the imperfect copies from which she intends to distill information , and discards the anticlone .",
    "it is natural to consider that eve can perform a better attack by combining the clone - anticlone pair .    in connection with the clone - anticlone pair",
    ", there may exist several interesting quantum operations .",
    "for example , it is possible for eve to erase the signal information and cancel the amplification noise by properly performing a bell measurement on the clone - anticlone pair and displacing the other clone according to the measurement outcome as in cv quantum teleportation , although in this case eve obtains no signal information @xcite .",
    "it is also known that quadrature signals can be efficiently encoded by using the phase conjugate pair of coherent states @xmath1 compared with the normal pair @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that eve can also read the quadrature signal efficiently from the clone - anticlone pair . a variant of cloning machines that works with the phase - conjugate input has also been proposed @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the security of cv qkd using coherent states and rr @xcite against the cloning attack and its natural extensions , where , in addition to the clone , eve also keeps and utilizes the anticlone .",
    "we show that an optimization of this attack corresponds to the optimal gaussian individual attack @xcite .",
    "the realization of the optimal attack as well as that of the cloning attack seems to be impossible within the present technology because the attacks need a quantum memory to store the quantum signal for a sufficiently long time .",
    "we find a bell - measurement attack which works without a quantum memory and has better performance than the cloning attack .",
    "let us consider a three - mode bosonic system and the quantum circuit including an amp and two bss as in fig .",
    "alice prepares her state on the mode @xmath3 which is the input mode of the cloner .",
    "eve uses the ancillary modes @xmath4 for the second clone and @xmath5 for the amp .    ]",
    "eve s operation is as follows : first , eve amplifies the input of the mode @xmath6 with the ancillary mode @xmath7 .",
    "next , eve combines the amplified mode @xmath8 and the other ancillary mode @xmath9 by a bs with the transmission @xmath10 .",
    "one of the outgoing clones ( clone 1 ) on the mode @xmath11 is received by bob , and the other clone ( clone 2 ) on the mode @xmath12 is kept by eve . after eve learns bob s measurement basis , she combines the anticlone on the mode @xmath13 , which comes from the ancillary mode of the amp , and the clone 2 by a bs with the transmission @xmath14 .",
    "finally , eve performs her measurement on @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we define position quadrature and momentum quadrature of mode @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of mode @xmath21 .",
    "the transformations between modes are described by the unitary operators @xmath22 for an amp with the amplification gain @xmath23 and @xmath24 for a bs with the transmission @xmath25 .    the transformations between the modes are explicitly written as @xmath26 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq5]),([eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , we obtain the mode operators of the output :    @xmath27    note that the state of bob s mode @xmath28 is determined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and does not depend on @xmath31 .",
    "in what follows , we use an abbreviated notation @xmath32 where we defined the coherent state @xmath33 with the amplitude @xmath34 of mode @xmath35 by @xmath36 .",
    "for example , we can write the amplitudes of the output modes associated with the input @xmath37 as @xmath38 from these expressions , we can see that eve s operation does not couple the real and imaginary parts of quadratures .",
    "this fact suggests that it is inefficient for eve to measure a quadrature with an angle different from the one chosen by bob .",
    "so we consider strategies in which eve measures the same quadrature as bob chooses .",
    "we assume that alice and bob have the lossy and noisy transmission channel characterized by the line transmission @xmath39 and excess noise @xmath40 , those are related to the amplitude and variance of bob s mode @xmath11 by @xmath41 suppose that eve replaces the channel with the circuit in fig .",
    "then , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined to be @xmath42    if we take @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , the circuit is the optimal gaussian @xmath0 cloning machine @xcite . in this case",
    "we can see that the states of @xmath11 and @xmath15 are symmetric clones @xmath46 and the clone - anticlone pair has the time - reversal relation @xmath47 .    if we take @xmath48 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , we can see that the mode operators of @xmath15 and @xmath16 almost duplicate the position and momentum quadrature of the input mode , respectively : @xmath49 this relation implies that by measuring @xmath50 and @xmath51 simultaneously eve can efficiently learn the amplitude of the input state as in the efficient coding @xcite .",
    "this measurement is considered to be a bell measurement on the modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "as we will show later this bell measurement leads to an efficient attack which does not need the quantum memory to store the signal coherently .",
    "in the rr protocol , alice sends the coherent state @xmath52 with the probability density @xmath53 and bob randomly measures one of the quadratures .",
    "the density operator of the input state can be written as @xmath54 for calculation of the expectation values the following form is convenient @xmath55 a sufficient condition for secure key distribution against a gaussian individual attack where eve uses the measurement result of a single mode quadrature after bob s basis is declared is given by @xmath56 where the conditional variance of @xmath57 given @xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 and the variables of alice , bob and eve are denoted by the subscripts @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the conditional variance becomes smaller as the variables become more correlated .",
    "let us calculate alice s conditional variances , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in our formulation ,",
    "the first moment of the quadratures is @xmath65 for any @xmath21 .",
    "the relevant terms for @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67 note that @xmath68 corresponds to alice s position quadrature which is determined by alice s choice of the parameter @xmath34 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3])-([e6 ] ) , we have @xmath69 it means that alice can predict bob s measurement result within the uncertainty of the vacuum noise plus excess noise .",
    "this is also a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "similarly we have @xmath70    to calculate eve s conditional variances , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , let us assume that bob measures @xmath73 and then eve adjusts @xmath31 and measures @xmath74 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath75 . from eqs . ( [ maintrans ] ) , ( [ phi ] ) , and ( [ lam ] ) we can write @xmath76 where @xmath77 then , using @xmath78 we obtain @xmath79 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ e - pos ] ) and ( [ eb - pos ] ) , we can write    @xmath80    with @xmath81    since the replacement of the modes @xmath82 corresponds to the replacement @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ maintrans ] ) , we can write @xmath84    the conditional variance of momentum quadratures can be calculated in the same manner and we can verify @xmath85 using relations ( [ omegaa ] ) , ( [ r1 ] ) , ( [ vp1 ] ) , and ( [ vp2 ] ) , we can calculate @xmath86 and @xmath87 for various strategies taken by eve . from eqs .",
    "( [ omegaa ] ) and ( [ vp2 ] ) , we can see that by setting @xmath88 eve can estimate both of the quadratures with the same uncertainty simultaneously , i.e. , @xmath89",
    "in this section , we investigate the security condition ( [ cri2 ] ) for the following four attacks .",
    "firstly , we consider two simple attacks where eve uses either the clone 2 or the anticlone .",
    "we call them the _ cloning attack _ and the _ anticloning attack _ , respectively .",
    "next , we consider two attacks where eve uses both the clone 2 and the anticlone . in one attack",
    ", eve does not use the quantum memory and performs a bell measurement . in the other attack",
    "eve optimizes @xmath31 in order to minimize her conditional variance .",
    "we assume that eve utilizes only the mode @xmath12 ( clone 2 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 . using the relations @xmath92 , @xmath93 , ( [ omegaa ] ) , and ( [ vp1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath94 the security condition ( [ cri2 ] ) requires @xmath95      we assume that eve utilizes only the mode @xmath13 ( anticlone ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 . using the relations @xmath98 , @xmath99 , ( [ omegaa ] ) , and ( [ vp1 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath100 we can write the security condition as @xmath101      as we have seen in the ends of sec . ii and iii , eve may perform a bell measurement on the clone - anticlone pair without using any quantum memory .",
    "suppose that eve s operation is as follows : eve fixes @xmath88 so that the contributions of the mode @xmath6 to the modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 become equivalent .",
    "she performs position - quadrature measurement on the mode @xmath15 and momentum - quadrature measurement on the mode @xmath16 right after she received the state .",
    "she chooses one of the measurement results after she learns bob s choice of the quadratures .",
    "we call this attack the _ bell measurement attack _ ( bma ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thanks to the relation ( [ vp2 ] ) , we can estimate eve s conditional variances by @xmath104 the security condition becomes @xmath105      in our formulation , eve s optimal strategy is to select @xmath106 in order to minimize her conditional variance .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath107 is given by @xmath108with @xmath109 eve can achieve the optimal value for each quadrature by measuring @xmath110 or @xmath111 according to bob s choice , position or momentum quadrature , respectively ; @xmath112    the value @xmath113 corresponds to the lower bound of eve s conditional variance which saturates the heisenberg - type uncertainty relation @xcite and thus the optimization of our scheme gives an implementation of the optimal gaussian individual attack .",
    "another implementation of the optimal gaussian individual attack is found in @xcite .",
    "the security condition can be written as @xmath114    in the high - modulation limit @xmath115 , we have @xmath116      in fig .",
    "[ fig - d - e ] , we show the curves given by @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 at the high - modulation limit @xmath115 . for each attack , the security condition is satisfied below the curve .",
    "we also show a necessary condition of cv qkd using coherent states @xcite : @xmath121 .",
    "this bound is given by an intercept - resend attack based on the simultaneous measurement of the quadratures and can be also derived from the separable condition of cv systems @xcite . above this curve",
    "secure key distribution is impossible .     and",
    "quadrature excess noise @xmath40 in the high - modulation limit ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the dash - dotted line is for the cloning attack , the dotted line is for the anticloning attack , the dashed line is for the bell - measurement attack , and the solid line is for the optimal gaussian individual attack .",
    "the dot - dash - dotted line is for the intercept - resend attack which gives a necessary condition of cv qkd using coherent states @xcite .",
    "[ fig - d - e ] ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig - d - e ] we can see that the anticloning attack is better than the cloning attack and bma is better than the anticloning attack at the high - modulation limit .",
    "this order is conserved in the case of finite modulation provided @xmath123 and @xmath124 , i.e. , from eqs .",
    "( [ cri - i ] ) , ( [ cri - ii ] ) , ( [ cri - iii ] ) and ( [ cri - iiii ] ) we can verify @xmath125 it shows that the cloning attack is the weakest attack among the four . the fact that the cloning attack is weaker than the anticloning attack seems to be counter - intuitive",
    "because the amplitude of the clone 2 is always larger than that of the anticlone if @xmath126 , i.e. , @xmath127 an interpretation of the result is as follows : one can show that the clone 1 and clone 2 are not entangled but in a mixture of coherent states @xcite .",
    "thus the bipartite system can not make stronger correlations between any two of the quadratures beyond the vacuum fluctuation . on the other hand , since the amplified mode and anticlone mode , @xmath8 and @xmath13 ,",
    "are entangled due to the process of the amp , it is possible to make stronger correlations between the quadrature of them beyond the vacuum fluctuation .",
    "this leads to a smaller conditional variance .",
    "relation ( [ fin ] ) also shows that the clone - anticlone pair without delayed choice of measurements provides a better attack than either of the cloning and anticloning attacks .",
    "this implies the utility of the phase - conjugate pair @xcite .    in the high - modulation and high - loss limit ( @xmath128 and , @xmath129 ) , from eqs .",
    "( [ cri - i ] ) , ( [ cri - ii ] ) , ( [ cri - iii ] ) , and ( [ cri - iiii ] ) we can see that the cloning and anticloning attacks provide nearly the same security bound @xmath130 and that bma provides nearly optimal bound : @xmath131 the existence of such an effective attack without delayed choice of measurements is interesting and it seems to be a characteristic of cv qkd using coherent states . in general , indirect measurement is considered to be powerful because eve can use a quantum memory and she can perform her measurement after she learns bob s measurement basis . if eve can not use the quantum memory she has to measure different quantities simultaneously to infer the signal because she does not know the basis .",
    "generally the simultaneous measurement of non - commutable observables costs additional noise and indirect measurement without delayed choice seems to be inefficient .",
    "however , in our case of the cv qkd under realistic condition , the difference between with and without the quantum memory is not significant as shown above . from practical aspect bma",
    "should be considered seriously because it means that a very efficient attack can be realized without advanced technologies .",
    "we have investigated the security of cv qkd using coherent states and reverse reconciliation against individual gaussian attacks based on an optimal gaussian 1@xmath1322 cloning machine .",
    "we have assumed that one of the clones is delivered to bob and eve combines the other clone and the anticlone using a bs and performs quadrature measurements . in this approach",
    ", we can connect and analyze different individual gaussian attacks just by changing the parameter of the bs .",
    "we found an efficient individual attack which works without delayed choice of measurements and has better performance than either of the cloning and anticloning attacks .",
    "the operation of this attack provides a simultaneous - measurement scheme which leaves an imperfect copy . in other words",
    ", it provides a way to perform a simultaneous measurement of the quadratures indirectly so that the measurement induced noise corresponds to a given value . in the high - loss and high - modulation limit",
    ", we showed that the security bound given by this attack is nearly the same as the one given by the optimal gaussian individual attack .",
    "we also found that the optimization of the bs parameter with a delayed choice of measurements provides an implementation of the optimal gaussian individual attack .",
