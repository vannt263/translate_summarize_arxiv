    "the recent measurements of @xmath4 at hera by the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations open a new kinematic domain for the study of the structure function of the proton .",
    "the new hera data showed a dramatic increase of @xmath4 with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "these measurements can be interpreted as virtual photon ",
    "proton cross sections .",
    "the @xmath4 data ( for @xmath6 0 ) can be converted into @xmath7 as a function of @xmath8 using the relation : @xmath9 and using @xmath10    the zeus collaboration showed that when their @xmath4 data are interpreted as total virtual photon ",
    "proton cross sections , @xmath7 has a fast rise with @xmath8 in the range @xmath11 gev for @xmath12 gev@xmath2 . in this note a compilation of cross sections  @xcite is presented for a wider range of @xmath1 and @xmath13 to study the behaviour of the total cross section as function of both variables .",
    "earlier studies of the behaviour of @xmath7 with @xmath8 were limited to center of mass energies @xmath15 20 gev . in  @xcite we studied the data of the emc collaboration  @xcite dis @xmath16p .",
    "it was shown that when the @xmath17 cross sections are plotted as a function of @xmath13 , for fixed @xmath1 , they are strongly increasing with @xmath8 for high @xmath1 , while they have a much milder dependence on @xmath8 for low @xmath1 .",
    "the strong rise at high @xmath1 can be associated with the threshold behaviour of a cross section corresponding to a virtual particle with @xmath18 .",
    "figure 1 is taken from  @xcite and shows the emc data together with curves which are a fit to a regge type energy behaviour to the data .",
    "the fitted expression also includes a threshold factor to explain the sharp rise with @xmath8 at higher @xmath1 values .",
    "data are shown in figure 2 for @xmath1 values starting from @xmath1=0 ( real photoproduction ) up to @xmath20 gev@xmath2 . the energy range is @xmath21 gev@xmath2 , where the lower limit is chosen so as to be above the resonance region . in order not to overcrowd the picture , selected @xmath1 regions are shown .",
    "the following observations can be pointed out from the behaviour of the data . in the low @xmath8 region ( @xmath22 400 gev@xmath2 ) one observes a slow decrease of the cross section with energy for the lower @xmath1 region .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , one starts to observe the threshold effects shown in figure 1 for cases where @xmath18 .",
    "these cause the cross section to rise steeper as @xmath1 increases .    in the higher @xmath8 range",
    ", there exist now the new total photoproduction cross section measurements for @xmath23 0 by zeus  @xcite and by h1  @xcite which show that the cross section has a slow increase with energy , in accord with expectations from regge theory based models  @xcite .",
    "there are no measurements in the low @xmath1 range ( @xmath24 0.3 - 5 gev@xmath2 ) at high @xmath8 , so one can not see if it behaves in the same way as the @xmath1 = 0 photoproduction data .",
    "however as @xmath1 increase ( @xmath25 gev@xmath2 ) there is a definite change of the energy behaviour of @xmath7 .",
    "the energy dependence becomes much steeper than at low @xmath1 .",
    "the curves in figure 2 are the calculated @xmath17 cross sections using the allm  @xcite parametrization . the parameters of allm have been obtained by a fit to the available data below @xmath26 20 gev .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the low @xmath8 data constrained the parameters so as to force a rising cross section at high @xmath8 and high @xmath1 .",
    "this is connected to the fact that the pomeron trajectory was allowed to vary with @xmath1 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the exact location of the transition from values of @xmath27 1.05 to @xmath27 1.4 is not clear since there is a lack of data in the region of @xmath28 gev@xmath2 and @xmath29 20 gev .",
    "the zeus data indicate that the transition from a slow to a steeply rising pomeron is more gradual than proposed by figure 3 and even at a @xmath1 of @xmath24 15 gev@xmath2 the slope is still halfway between the two extreme values .",
    "the shape assumed by the allm parametrization in the transition region could account for the fact that the curves do nt reproduce the high @xmath8 data for the @xmath1 values of 8.7 and 15 gev@xmath2 , shown in figure 2 .",
    "it does however fit quite well both the @xmath1 = 0 and the higher @xmath1 data in the whole @xmath8 region .    in order to get a better understanding of the data in figure 2 ,",
    "one clearly needs more measurements to fill in two large gaps  @xcite .",
    "one gap is the low to intermediate @xmath1 region , where the transition of the energy dependence from a slow to steep rise occurs . in these region",
    "higher @xmath8 measurements are needed , which would correspond to lower @xmath5 measurements at low @xmath1 .",
    "the data of e665  @xcite , once in final form , will fill up part of this gap .",
    "the other gap is the energy range of @xmath13 = 40040000 gev@xmath2 at higher @xmath1 values .",
    "this would correspond to dis measurements at higher @xmath5 .",
    "these additional needed measurements would cover the holes in the @xmath5@xmath1 plane and will provide additional handles to study the transition region between the so  called soft pomeron with a donnachie  landshoff type of slope of 1.08 and the hard pomeron with a lipatov type of slope of about 1.5 .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath1 dependence of the pomeron intercept shown in figure 3 could be that the pomeron trajectory has a different behaviour than that of the other known ones , changing its intercept as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this interpretation is of course not unique .",
    "as pointed out by bjorken  @xcite , another possibility could be that the intercept plotted in figure 3 is an effective one , being the superposition of two different pomeron trajectories , one having an intercept of 1.08 and the other one of 1.5 , as illustrated in figure 4 . the slope of the @xmath30 dependence is usually taken as 0.25 gev@xmath31 for the soft pomeron . for the hard pomeron ,",
    "the slope shown is arbitrarily taken as 0.025 gev@xmath31 .",
    "the amount of mixture of the two intercepts is @xmath1 dependent : @xmath32 with the dominant contribution of the first in the low @xmath1 region and the dominance of the second in the high @xmath1 region .    continuing in the same speculative spirit , one could ask oneself about the strong resemblance between the behaviour of the pomeron(s ) and the photon .",
    "do we see a resolved and direct pomeron like in the photon case ?",
    "any relation between these components and the soft and hard pomerons ?",
    "the hope is that the expected new measurements of the two hera collaborations in the gap regions will allow a better understanding of the transition region and may shed some light on this so important issue of the pomeron properties .",
    "another question that one would like to study is whether the total @xmath17 will continue to rise for @xmath33 gev@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "will there be a cross  over of virtual and real photon ",
    "proton cross sections or will @xmath34 also start rising more steeply , as predicted by some qcd inspired models ?",
    "one way to reach this high @xmath13 region would be to wait for the @xmath35p option of the lhc .",
    "however as an alternative to waiting at least 20 years for an answer , one should perhaps consider the possibilities of raising the energies at the hera collider .",
    "since @xmath36 increasing the energy of the electron beam , of the proton beam or perhaps of both , will provide the answer as far as the rise is concerned .",
    "in addition , it will get us to much lower @xmath5 regions ( @xmath37 ) than at present energies , allowing to study parton saturation effects .",
    "as strange as it might sound , the understanding of the complicated nature of the pomeron is necessary to improve our picture of qcd .",
    "one can study the interesting properties of the pomeron through the measurements of the total cross sections of real and virtual photons , which show a change in their energy behaviour by going from real to highly virtual photons . in order to learn",
    "more about the transition region one needs to fill some gaps in the measurements of the total @xmath17 cross section at low @xmath1 and intermediate @xmath8 .",
    "this will be achieved in the near future .",
    "in addition , one needs to measure both @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath8 s larger than presently available at hera .",
