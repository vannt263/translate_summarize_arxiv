    "the top quark has been one of the most promising channels to search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among the observables involving the top quark ,",
    "the top forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath4 ) at the tevatron has been paid much attention during the past few years , because it is the only quantity which has some deviations from the sm prediction in top quark sector .",
    "the cdf collaboration announced that @xmath4 in the @xmath5 rest frame is @xmath6 in the lepton+jets channel  @xcite , and @xmath7 in the dilepton channel  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the combined result of them is @xmath8 , which is consistent with @xmath9 announced by the d0 collaboration in the lepton+jets channel  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the cdf collaboration updated the results for @xmath4 in the lepton+jets channel with data of a luminosity of @xmath10 fb@xmath11 : @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this value is consistent with the previous measurements at cdf and d0 .",
    "the sm predictions for @xmath4 are @xmath13 at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) + next - to - next - to - leading logarithm accuracies  @xcite and @xmath14 with nlo corrections for the electroweak interactions  @xcite , respectively .",
    "therefore there is still about 2@xmath15 deviation between the sm prediction and experiments in the integrated @xmath16 at the tevatron .",
    "a number of new models have been proposed to account for the discrepancy in @xmath4  @xcite . in order that those new models can accommodate the present data in the drell - yan , dijet production , flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) experiments and so on , it is usually assumed that the new model has a large coupling only to the top quark . in general",
    ", it would be a challenging task to construct a realistic and consistent model with such a hierarchy in couplings .",
    "new models should also be anomaly - free and have proper yukawa interactions .",
    "otherwise there could be some hidden fields that might affect the physical observables we are interested in .",
    "one of the most interesting models to account for @xmath4 is a @xmath17 model with an additional chiral u(1)@xmath0 symmetry , where only the right - handed ( rh ) up - type quarks in the sm are charged under the u(1)@xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "such a chiral u(1)@xmath0 symmetry is inevitably accompanied with the modification of the higgs sector in the sm , for instance , the addition of the multi - higgs doublets charged under the u(1)@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "there are two reasons why we have to extend the higgs sector .",
    "first of all , all the sm fermions charged under chiral u(1)@xmath0 ( such as top quark in refs .",
    "@xcite ) would be massless and so the model becomes unphysical without extra higgs doublets charged under u(1)@xmath0 .",
    "there is no limit where one can integrate out these u(1)@xmath0-charged higgs doublets assuming they are heavy .",
    "secondly , the mass of the @xmath17 boson could be generated through the u(1)@xmath0 breaking .",
    "one can achieve this either by the u(1)@xmath0-charged higgs doublets or u(1)@xmath0-charged higgs singlet . without these higgs fields that generate the @xmath17 mass",
    ", the theory violates unitarity at high energy , and it loses its predictability .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar to the unitarity problem of the @xmath18 or @xmath19 scatterings in the intermediate vector boson model .",
    "the unitarity of the model would be restored with the u(1)@xmath0-charged higgs fields ( doublets and singlet ) .",
    "that is , additional higgs fields are mandatory for generation of masses of the sm fermions charged under chiral u(1)@xmath0 and the u(1)@xmath0 gauge boson ( @xmath17 ) itself .",
    "the requirement for the extra higgs fields is also true in the @xmath20  @xcite , axigluon  @xcite , flavor su(3)@xmath21  @xcite , and any other models if the sm fermions are chiral under new gauge interactions .    on the other hand",
    ", the gauge anomaly would exist in general if one introduces the flavor - dependent chiral u(1)@xmath0 symmetry .",
    "but it could be canceled by introducing extra fermions  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in order to construct a realistic model for the chiral u(1)@xmath0 symmetry , one must take into account carefully the u(1)@xmath0-charged higgs fields and extra fermion fields in addition to the extra u(1)@xmath0 gauge field .",
    "it is important to realize that there is no proper limit where only light @xmath22 survives with chiral couplings to the right - handed up - type quarks . literally speaking ,",
    "the model by jung , murayama , pierce and wells  @xcite is not well defined as a gauge theory and not realistic , since the up - type quarks are all massless including top quarks .",
    "it is mandatory to extend the model by introducing extra higgs doublets with nonzero u(1)@xmath0 charges , because the up - type quarks ( including top quark ) would be all massless without the extra higgs doublets .    the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "is also called a `` top factory '' because a huge number of top - quark pair ( larger than about @xmath23 ) is expected to be produced at the lhc even before the technical shutdown at the end of this year . thus new models proposed for resolutions of @xmath4 at the tevatron including the flavor - dependent chiral u(1)@xmath0 model with flavored higgs doublets  @xcite could be tested at the lhc .",
    "for instance , the original @xmath17 model is strongly constrained by the same - sign top - quark pair production at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "another interesting observable at the lhc is the top charge asymmetry @xmath24 defined by the difference of numbers of events with the positive and negative @xmath25 divided by their sum : @xmath26 where @xmath27 for the rapidities @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the top and anti - top quarks .",
    "because the lhc is a symmetric collider under charge conjugation , @xmath4 can not be defined at the lhc , unlike the tevatron . however , at the lhc the top quark produced in the @xmath30 process is statistically more boosted to the beam direction compared to the anti - top quark because the top quark follows the direction of the incident quark which has a larger longitudinal momentum .",
    "this difference could generate the charge asymmetry in eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) .",
    "the theoretical estimate for @xmath24 is about @xmath31 at nlo  @xcite , which is consistent with the empirical data @xmath32 at atlas  @xcite and @xmath33 at cms  @xcite within uncertainties .    in the previous works",
    "@xcite , we considered only @xmath16 at the tevatron and the same - sign top - quark pair production rate at the lhc in order to find parameter regions of the models which are consistent with the data available at that time . in this paper",
    ", we consider top charge asymmetry at the lhc within the same chiral u(1)@xmath0 model , taking into account more stringent recent constraints on the same - sign top - quark pair production at atlas  @xcite , and investigate if the model in refs .",
    "@xcite survives or not , and how we can test further these models at the lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly review the chiral u(1)@xmath0 models with flavored higgs doublets which were first proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , with focus on the lagrangian relevant to @xmath4 at the tevatron and @xmath24 at the lhc . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] , we discuss the phenomenology of our model at the tevatron and lhc . finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "in this section we review the flavor - dependent chiral u(1)@xmath0 model with flavored higgs doublets that were proposed in refs .",
    "our model is an extension of a simple phenomenological @xmath17 model with a large flavor changing neutral couplings in the @xmath35 sector  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath17 boson must be associated with some gauge symmetry if we work in weakly interacting theories . as a simple example we considered an extra u(1)@xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 boson better be leptophobic to avoid the stringent constraints from the lep ii and drell - yang experiments .",
    "furthermore , it would be very difficult to assign flavor - dependent u(1)@xmath0 charges to the down - type quarks and left - handed up - type quarks because it gives rise to dangerous fcncs .",
    "therefore we assigned flavor - dependent u(1)@xmath0 charges @xmath36 @xmath37 only to the right - handed up - type quarks while the left - handed quarks and right - handed down - type quarks have universal charges @xmath38 and @xmath39 under u(1)@xmath0 . for simplicity , we assign @xmath40 .",
    "then , the lagrangian between @xmath17 and the sm quarks in the interaction eigenstates is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a right - handed up - type quark field in the interaction eigenstates and @xmath43 is the couping of the u(1)@xmath0 .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , we can rotate the quark fields into the mass eigenstates by bi - unitary transformation .",
    "the interaction lagrangian for the @xmath17 boson in the mass eigenstate is given by    @xmath44.\\ ] ]    the @xmath45 mixing matrix @xmath46 is the product of the u(1)@xmath0 charge matrix @xmath47 and a unitary matrix @xmath48 , where the matrix @xmath48 relates the rh up - type quarks in the interaction eigenstates and in the mass eigenstates .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 participates in diagonalizing the up - type quark mass matrix . in principle",
    ", the mixing matrix @xmath49 could be complex , providing an additional source of cp violation in the right - handed up - type quark sector . in this work , we assume it is real for simplicity .",
    "we note that the components of the mixing angles related to the charm quark have to be small in order to respect constraints from the @xmath50-@xmath51 mixing .",
    "if one assigns the u(1)@xmath0 charge @xmath52 to the right - handed up - type quarks , one can find the relation @xmath53 .",
    "this relation indicates that if the @xmath54-channel diagram mediated by @xmath17 contributes to the @xmath55 process , the @xmath56-channel diagram mediated by @xmath17 should be taken into account , too .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , it is mandatory to include additional flavored higgs doublets charged under u(1)@xmath0 in order to write down proper yukawa interactions for the sm quarks charged under u(1)@xmath0 at the renormalizable level .",
    "charges in order that one can write yukawa couplings for the up - type quarks in this model . ]",
    "the number of additional higgs doublets depends on the u(1)@xmath0 charge assignment to the sm fermions , especially the right - handed up - type quarks . in general",
    ", one must add three additional higgs doublets with u(1)@xmath0 charges @xmath36 [ see refs .",
    "@xcite for more discussions ] . for the charge assignment @xmath52",
    "we have two higgs doublets including the sm - like higgs doublet , while for @xmath57 three higgs doublets are required .",
    "the additional u(1)@xmath0 must be broken in the end , so that we add a u(1)@xmath0-charged singlet higgs field @xmath58 to the sm .",
    "both the u(1)@xmath0-charged higgs doublet and the singlet @xmath58 can give the masses for the @xmath17 boson and extra fermions if it has a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "after breaking of the electroweak and u(1)@xmath0 symmetries , one can write down the yukawa interactions in the mass basis .",
    "the yukawa couplings depend on the masses of the involved quarks and the mixing angles between the higgs fields and the right - handed up - type quarks , which rely on the u(1)@xmath0 charge assignment  @xcite .",
    "after all the yukawa couplings would be proportional to the quark masses responsible for the interactions so that we could ignore the yukawa couplings which are not related to the top quark .",
    "the number of relevant higgs bosons participating in the top - quark pair production depends on the u(1)@xmath0 charge assignment and mixing angles .",
    "the relevant yukawa couplings for the top - quark pair production can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are is the lightest neutral scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , and @xmath62 is the heavier ( second lightest ) neutral higgs boson .",
    "we assume that the yukawa couplings of the other higgs bosons are suppressed by the mixing angles .    in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the explicit expressions are given in the @xmath52 case : @xmath63 the @xmath64 couplings could be also large .",
    "but in this case , the @xmath56-channel contribution of the higgs bosons to the production of the top - quark pair would be suppressed by the @xmath65 couplings of light quarks , which are proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "finally , leptophobic and flavor - dependent chiral u(1)@xmath0 models are anomalous . the gauge anomalies can be easily canceled by adding extra chiral fermions : for example , one extra generation and two sm gauge vector - like pairs  @xcite .",
    "one of the fermions may be a good candidate for the dark matter and the higgs boson could decay to two dark matters because of the mixing between the higgs doublets and the sm singlet field @xmath58 .",
    "if the branching ratio of the higgs boson to the dark matters is large , the stringent constraints from the higgs boson search at the lhc could be relaxed @xcite , and the higgs boson of mass around 200 gev is still viable because it could decay into a pair of cdm s .",
    "in this section , we discuss phenomenology of our model described in the previous section . if new physics affects the top - quark pair production and could accommodate @xmath4 at the tevatron , it must also be consistent with many other experimental measurements related with the top quark . in our models , both the @xmath17 and higgs bosons @xmath60 and @xmath61 contribute to the top - quark pair production through the @xmath54-channel exchange in the @xmath67 process . as we discussed in the previous section , the @xmath17 boson also contributes to the top - quark pair production through the @xmath56-channel exchange , which was ignored in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as two extreme cases , one can consider the cases where only the @xmath17 boson or higgs boson @xmath60 contributes to the top - quark pair production .",
    "then , our models become close to the simple @xmath17 model of ref .",
    "@xcite or the scalar - exchange model of ref .",
    "unfortunately , these models can not be compatible with the present upper bound on the same - sign top - quark pair production at the lhc in the parameter space which give rise to a moderate @xmath4  @xcite . in our chiral u(1)@xmath0 models ,",
    "the constraint from the same - sign top - quark pair production could be relaxed because of the destructive interference between the contribution from the @xmath17 and those from higgs bosons @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , the contribution of the pseudoscalar boson @xmath61 to the same - sign top - quark pair production is opposite to the other contributions .    in the two higgs doublet model with the @xmath68 assignments to the right - handed up - type quarks , @xmath52 ,",
    "the @xmath56-channel contribution of the @xmath17 exchange to the partonic process @xmath55 is as strong as an @xmath54-channel contribution because of the relation @xmath53  @xcite . in the multi - higgs doublet models ( mhdms ) with other u(1)@xmath0 charge assignments @xmath69s to the right - handed up - type quarks , the @xmath56-channel contribution could be small .",
    "in general , one can write @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a function of mixing angles and @xmath72 . in the case of @xmath73 , a resonance around the @xmath17 mass for nonzero @xmath71",
    "would be observed in the @xmath5 invariant mass distribution .",
    "such a resonance has not been observed so far in the experiments  @xcite .",
    "this would restrict the @xmath17 mass to be much smaller than @xmath74 for nonzero @xmath71 .",

    "the cross sections for the top - quark pair production are @xmath77 pb at cms  @xcite and @xmath78 pb at atlas  @xcite , respectively . in this work",
    ", we require that the cross section for the top - quark pair production is in agreement with the cdf result in the @xmath79 level , which has the least uncertainty .",
    "another reason to use the tevatron result for the check of our model is that the top - quark pair production at the tevatron is more sensitive to new physics in the @xmath55 process than at the lhc .    in the sm ,",

    "if the @xmath17 or higgs bosons are lighter than the top quark , it could be dangerous because the branching ratio of the top quark to @xmath80 is significantly altered .",
    "we assume that the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath61 is heavier than the top quark and the branching ratio of the exotic decay of the top quark such as @xmath84 is less than 5% .",
    "we find that the exotic decay mode of the top quark can be suppressed , if we choose @xmath85 for @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 for @xmath88 gev .",
    "furthermore , such large fcncs could generate the same - sign top - quark pair production through the @xmath54-channel diagram in the @xmath89 process , which is forbidden within the sm  @xcite .",

    "if we choose @xmath109 or the decay width of the @xmath17 boson is sufficiently large , then the resonance peak may not be observed in experiments for @xmath140 . in our @xmath141 model , the latter case can not be realized .",
    "however , the former case might be possible for a certain mixing angles in the mhdms .",
    "therefore , we searched for the parameter space which is consistent with all the experiments by setting @xmath109 .",
    "however , we found no favored region in this case too .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 could not be accommodated with the cdf data in the 1@xmath15 level . however , if we search with more relaxed experimental constraints , for example , the 2@xmath15 level for @xmath4 , we find that there exist the favored region consistent with all the experiments .      up to now , we have kept only the lightest scalar ( @xmath60 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath61 ) higgs bosons , assuming other heavier higgs bosons decouple from top physics because either they are very heavy or they have small yukawa couplings . in this subsection",
    ", we will relax this assumption , and include the second lightest higgs boson @xmath62 in the analysis . for the completeness",
    ", one must consider all the higgs bosons as well as the extra fermions , but it would be quite complicated and time - consuming since there are too many new parameters involved",
    ". we will be content with a simplified discussion of higgs sector . in the following sections , we consider two cases @xmath108 and @xmath109 for illustration .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath108 case . if the second lightest scalar higgs boson @xmath62 has a flavor - changing coupling to the top quark like the lightest scalar higgs boson @xmath60 , there are four new particles @xmath17 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 that contribute to the top - quark pair production .",
    "we take the lightest higgs boson mass to be @xmath130 gev like in the previous case .",
    "the other parameters are taken to be in the following ranges : @xmath142 gev , @xmath143 tev , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the mass of the second lightest scalar higgs boson and @xmath148 is its yukawa coupling to the @xmath149-@xmath54-@xmath62 vertex .",
    "note that the range of the @xmath17 boson mass is chosen to avoid the constraints from the top quark decay and @xmath5 invariant mass distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : higgs2 ] ( a ) shows the scattered plot for @xmath4 at the tevatron and @xmath115 at the lhc in unit of pb . the red points satisfy the cross section for the top - quark pair production at the tevatron in the 1@xmath15 level .",
    "the horizontal lines are upper limits on the same - sign top - quark pair production at cms and atlas , respectively .",
    "the blue and skyblue regions are consistent with @xmath4 in the lepton+jets channel at cdf within 1@xmath15 and 2@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we find that there exist some parameter regions which are in agreement with @xmath4 within 1@xmath15 and the upper limit on @xmath115 at atlas .",
    "thus the light higgs boson with @xmath88 gev in our model could pass all the experimental constraints if the heavier scalar higgs boson @xmath62 contributes to the top - quark pair production .    in fig .",

    ", we find some parameter regions satisfying all the experimental constraints . like the light @xmath17 case",
    ", one would find the allowed regions in the whole range of @xmath127 .      in this section",
    ", we examined three different cases of chiral u(1)@xmath2 models proposed by the present authors  @xcite : ( i ) the light @xmath17 model with @xmath150 gev and @xmath60 and @xmath61 being heavier than the top quark , ( ii ) the light scalar higgs model with @xmath130 gev and @xmath17 and @xmath61 being heavier than the top quark , and ( iii ) the light scalar higgs model with @xmath17 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 , where @xmath130 gev , @xmath151 gev and @xmath152 .    in the first and third cases we can find the parameter regions which are in good agreement with all the experimental constraints in the 1@xmath15 level , but in the second case the accommodation is possible only in the 2@xmath15 level .",
    "except the above cases , there can exist other cases which might be consistent with experiments .",
    "for instance , one can consider the light @xmath17 and light higgs model .",
    "suppose that @xmath116 gev and @xmath88 gev , but the lightest higgs boson weakly couples to the top quark .",
    "then , we can apply the case ( i ) to this model by assuming that the lightest higgs boson has a negligible off - diagonal yukawa coupling and the second higgs boson has a large off - diagonal yukawa coupling .",
    "@xmath4 reported by cdf and d0 collaborations has been one of the hottest issues in particle physics phenomenology during last four years .",
    "assuming that the observed deviation in @xmath4 might be a signal of new physics , a number of models have been proposed to explain the observed @xmath4 .",
    "some models were already disfavored by experiments , and other models might be verified at the lhc soon .    in the refs .",
    "@xcite , the present authors have proposed complete realistic models with u(1)@xmath2 flavor symmetry , where only right - handed up - type quarks are charged flavor - dependently , in order to avoid the strong constraints on fcnc . then , realistic yukawa interactions were constructed by adding extra higgs doublets which are charged under u(1)@xmath2 flavor symmetry .",
    "then , it was found that there arise new additional fcnc yukawa couplings involving the light ( pseudo)scalars .",
    "surprisingly , the interference between the extra gauge boson and scalar bosons can relax the bound from the same - sign top process at lhc , and we found that the light @xmath110 scenario can be revived .    in this work , we reexamined the u(1)@xmath2 models , including the updated results on the same - sign top - quark pair productions at the lhc , and investigated the top charge asymmetry at lhc .",
    "we found that there are parameter regions in the light @xmath22 model with scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , which are consistent with empirical data , for example , for @xmath116 gev , @xmath153 gev , and @xmath154 gev .",
    "however , if the same - sign top - quark pair production rate turns out to be smaller than @xmath117 pb , this model with the u(1)@xmath2 and light @xmath22 will be likely excluded .",
    "furthermore , the recent higgs search at the lhc , which has a tentative excess in about @xmath3 gev mass region , also constrains our scenario strongly .",
    "we also analyzed the light higgs boson case . in the case of the light higgs boson case with @xmath155 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 , where @xmath130 gev , @xmath156 gev and @xmath152 , there exist parameter spaces which can be in good agreement with all the empirical data within 1@xmath15 .",
    "even though the upper bound on the same - sign top - quark pair production rate at the lhc becomes less than 1 pb , we can find some parameter regions consistent with the experimental data .",
    "however , in the case that only the lightest higgs boson @xmath60 ( @xmath157 gev ) , pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath61 ( @xmath158 ) , and @xmath17 ( @xmath159 ) contribute to the top - quark pair production , we could not find the favored parameter regions which can be accommodated with the present experiments in the 1@xmath15 level . in this case",
    ", we must relax the experimental bound to the 2@xmath15 level , or consider the light @xmath17 model where the lightest higgs boson ( @xmath160 gev ) has a negligible off - diagonal yukawa coupling and the second lightest higgs boson has a large off - diagonal yukawa coupling .    usually the original @xmath17 model is considered having been disfavored , independently by the stringent upper bound on the same - sign top - quark pair production cross sections and the shape of @xmath1 spectrum at high @xmath1 region , as well as the null results of the charge asymmetry at the lhc .",
    "however , our current study and the previous analyses  @xcite show that these conclusions are too premature , since extra higgs doublets charged under u(1)@xmath0 are required for realistic yukawa couplings and they usually contribute to the top physics .",
    "when we extend the higgs sector and generate the top quark mass correctly as presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , there appear the neutral higgs mediated fcnc in the up - quark sector , which contributes to all the observables related with the top fb asymmetry at the tevatron and the charge asymmetry at the lhc .",
    "it is neither consistent nor complete to do phenomenological analysis , keeping only the @xmath17 contribution with the physical top mass equal to the experimental value .",
    "our predictions on the correlations among @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are completely different from the results in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) .",
    "these comments about new higgs doublets would apply to other models where new spin-1 vector bosons have chiral couplings to the sm fermions .",
    "also it should be emphasized that there is no mathematical limit where one can integrate out the u(1)@xmath0-charged new higgs doublets assuming they are very heavy , and keep only the light @xmath17 .",
    "the reason is that the would - be goldstone bosons eaten by the sm @xmath164 and @xmath165 are shared among all the higgs doublets with nonzero vev s . since these massless components are also reside in the u(1)@xmath0-charged higgs doublets",
    ", one can not integrate them out .",
    "also there would be the problem with the realistic yukawa couplings for the up - type quarks if one would have integrated them out .",
    "on the other hand , one can consider the opposite limit where the @xmath17 boson is very heavy and can be integrated out .",
    "then the low energy effective theory would be multi - higgs doublet models with some fcnc interactions to the up - type quarks .",
    "eventually our model may be excluded by the future experiments on the observables we studied in this paper or another observables . however the @xmath17 model with u(1)@xmath0-flavored higgs doublets are still viable explanations to the top fb asymmetry at the tevatron , without conflict with the same - sign top - quark pair productions , the @xmath1 distributions , or the charge asymmetry at the lhc , unlike the common belief .    finally , it should be mentioned that our study is not complete yet , because there are extra fields which we simply assumed to be subdominant for physics of @xmath4 . in this paper",
    ", we included the heavier neutral scalar bosons and could achieve the large @xmath4 without too large same - sign top - quark pair cross section .",
    "we demonstrated the lighter neutral scalar could correspond to the excess at lhc .",
    "such heavier neutral scalar bosons should also be constrained by the higgs search at the lhc and tevatron .    while we are finalizing this paper , both the atlas and cms collaborations",
    "have announced the discover of a higgs - like scalar boson with @xmath160 gev mass  @xcite . they have observed a rather larger excess in the @xmath166 channel and smaller signals in the @xmath167 channels .",
    "if the branching ratios settle down at the present values , our models will severely be constrained .",
    "we anticipate further results of this higgs - like scalar boson .",
    "furthermore , the cms collaboration has announced more stringent bound on the cross section for the same - sign top - quark pair production at the lhc : @xmath168 pb at 95% confidence level  @xcite . this strong",
    "bound would exclude the light @xmath17 boson case .",
    "however , we note that the light scalar higgs boson model with @xmath17 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 , where @xmath88 gev , @xmath156 gev and @xmath152 might be in agreement with this upper bound in a certain parameter space .",
