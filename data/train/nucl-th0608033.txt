    "experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) suggest that the matter created in semi-/central au - au collisions at @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 constitutes an equilibrated , strongly interacting medium at high energy density , well above the critical one at the expected phase boundary , @xmath3@xmath4  1gev/@xmath5 ( cf .",
    "the experimental assessment papers@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this conclusion is essentially based on three evidences : ( i ) at low transverse momenta , @xmath6@xmath72 - 3gev ( comprising @xmath899% of the produced hadrons ) , ideal relativistic hydrodynamics describes well the single - particle spectra and their azimuthal asymmetry , @xmath9 ; the underlying collective expansion follows from kinetic equilibration times of around @xmath10@xmath40.5fm/@xmath11 , implying rapid ( local ) thermalization of the system at initial energy densities of about @xmath12@xmath430gev/@xmath13 .",
    "( ii ) at high momenta , @xmath6@xmath145 - 6gev , the production of hadrons is suppressed by a factor of 4 - 5 relative to elementary @xmath15-@xmath15 ( or d - au ) collisions .",
    "this has been interpreted as energy loss of energetic partons traveling through an almost opaque high gluon - density medium .",
    "( iii ) at intermediate momenta , @xmath6@xmath42 - 6gev , surprisingly large baryon - to - meson ratios , as well as an empirical scaling of the hadron @xmath16 according to its constituent quark content , has been interpreted as quark coalescence as the prevalent hadronization mechanism in this regime , and thus as partonic degrees of freedom being active .",
    "the microscopic mechanisms underlying thermalization and energy loss , however , are not well understood yet .",
    "in fact , the jet quenching of light partons is so strong that high-@xmath6 particle emission appears to be mostly limited to the surface of the fireball , rendering a precise determination of the corresponding transport coefficient ( and maximal energy density ) difficult . while earlier approaches assumed the dominance of radiative energy loss via medium - induced gluon radiation ( which prevails in the limit of high jet energies ) cf .",
    "@xcite , it has been realized subsequently that elastic ( 2@xmath172 ) scattering processes can not be neglected at currently accessible @xmath6@xmath710 - 15gev at rhic .",
    "moreover , none of the evidences ( i)-(iii ) is directly connected to the fundamental properties distinguishing the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) from hadronic matter , namely the deconfinement of color charges and the restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry ( which is believed to generate most of the visible mass in the universe ) .",
    "heavy - quark ( hq ) observables are expected to provide new insights into the aforementioned problems ( with the exception of chiral symmetry restoration ) . on the one hand ,",
    "charm ( @xmath11 ) and bottom ( @xmath18 ) quarks , due to their relatively large mass , should suffer less energy loss and undergo delayed thermalization when traversing the qgp , and thus be more sensitive to the interactions with thermal partons than light quarks and gluons .",
    "therefore , it came as a surprise when the measurement of single - electron ( @xmath19 ) spectra associated with the semileptonic decay of open - charm ( and -bottom ) hadrons showed a factor 4 - 5 suppression@xcite , very comparable to what has been found for pions .",
    "in addition , the observed values for the @xmath19 elliptic flow , @xmath20 , reach up to 10% at @xmath6@xmath42gev , indicating the build - up of substantial _ early _ collectivity of @xmath11 quarks .",
    "these observations reinforced the implementation of elastic energy - loss processes into the theoretical description of the spectra@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , hq bound states ( quarkonia ) , due to their small size / large binding , are suitable probes of a surrounding medium of sufficiently high density .",
    "e.g. , for a typical ( ground - state ) charmonium of size @xmath21@xmath10.25fm , the relevant parton density at which significant modifications are to be expected is @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24@xmath23@xmath25-@xmath26@xmath27 , which for an ideal qgp ( with @xmath28@xmath12.5 massless flavors ) translates into a temperature of @xmath29@xmath23270mev@xmath23@xmath30 .",
    "indeed , recent lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations indicate that @xmath31 and @xmath32 states survive in a qgp up to @xmath82@xmath33 .",
    "the theoretical challenge is then to disentangle and quantify ( a ) medium modifications of the binding potential ( e.g. , color screening ) , ( b ) parton - induced dissociation reactions , and ( c ) in - medium changes of the hq mass which affects both the bound - state mass and its decay threshold , as well as to identify and establish connections to observables in heavy - ion collisions .    in the first part of the talk ( sec .",
    "[ sec_open ] ) , we evaluate hq diffusion and thermalization in the qgp employing both perturbative and _ nonperturbative _ elastic interactions . this problem is particularly suited to a fokker - planck approach for brownian motion in a thermal background@xcite , which allows to describe both the quasi - thermal and kinetic regime , and its transition .",
    "a langevin simulation for @xmath11 and @xmath18 quarks in an expanding qgp at rhic is supplemented with coalescence ( and fragmentation ) at @xmath33 , thus implementing all of the three main features ( i)-(iii ) of the initial rhic data . in the second part of the talk ( sec .",
    "[ sec_hidden ] ) , we discuss in - medium properties of heavy quarkonia , including information from lqcd .",
    "we outline a @xmath29-matrix approach in which hq potentials from lqcd are used as input to simultaneously describe bound and scattering states .",
    "this enables a comprehensive evaluation of euclidean correlation functions , which in turn can be checked against rather accurate results from lqcd .",
    "we briefly discuss how in - medium quarkonium properties reflect themselves in observables in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "[ sec_concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "recent calculations of hadronic spectral functions in a qgp , both within lqcd and lqcd - based potential models , suggest that resonance ( or bound ) states persist up to @xmath34 , for both heavy- ( @xmath35 ) and light - quark ( @xmath36 ) systems .",
    "we conjectured@xcite that this also holds for heavy - light systems , and therefore could lead to significantly faster thermalization for @xmath11 and @xmath18 quarks as compared to perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) processes .",
    "even at @xmath29=350mev ( which roughly corresponds to initial temperatures at rhic ) and for @xmath37@xmath10.4 , elastic pqcd scattering , which is dominated by @xmath38-channel gluon exchange , results in a thermal relaxation time for @xmath11 quarks above 10fm/@xmath11 , well above a the typical qgp lifetime of @xmath39@xmath85fm/@xmath11 .",
    "recent data on single - electron spectra associated with semileptonic heavy - meson decays have corroborated the need for nonperturbative hq interactions in the qgp .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pqcd ] , perturbative energy - loss calculations appear insufficient to describe the strong suppression in the @xmath6-spectra ( left panel , using both elastic and radiative interactions ) and the large @xmath9 ( right panel , using radiative energy loss with a substantially upscaled transport coefficient ) .",
    "while the plots indicate a ( lower ) applicability limit of the pqcd energy - loss approach of @xmath40@xmath42gev , we will argue below that nonperturbative effects may be relevant ( or even dominant ) up to at least @xmath40@xmath45gev .",
    "in particular , radiative energy - loss calculations typically do not include the backward reactions ( detailed balance ) which are essential for building up collective behavior of the heavy quarks in the expanding thermal medium . as mentioned above , in this context",
    "a brownian - motion approach is well suited to address the thermalization of the heavy quarks@xcite .",
    "upon expanding the boltzmann equation in small momentum transfers , one arrives at a fokker - planck equation for the hq distribution function , @xmath41 , @xmath42 with ( momentum ) drag ( @xmath43 ) and diffusion ( @xmath44 ) constants ( related via @xmath45 ) .",
    "the latter are calculated from corresponding matrix elements for hq scattering off light partons .",
    "+    as mentioned above , our main ingredient here are resonance - mediated elastic interactions in @xmath46- and @xmath47-channel ( cf .",

    "parameters of the model are the resonance mass ( which we fix at 0.5gev above the @xmath52-@xmath54 threshold ) and coupling constant , @xmath55 , which determines the resonance width .",
    "hq and chiral symmetry ( above @xmath33 ) imply degeneracy of the pseudo-/scalar and axial-/vector channels represented by the dirac matrices , @xmath56 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resulting thermal relaxation times , @xmath57 , for @xmath11- and @xmath18-quarks shows a factor of @xmath83 reduction compared to calculations where only pqcd elastic scattering is accounted for ( right panel of fig .  [ fig_tau ] ) .",
    "this is very significant for @xmath11-quarks as @xmath58 is now comparable to ( or even below ) the duration of the qgp phase at rhic ( @xmath39@xmath85fm/@xmath11 ) , whereas @xmath59@xmath60@xmath39 still , due to the large @xmath18-quark mass .",
    "the @xmath29- and @xmath15-dependent drag and diffusion coefficients have been implemented into a relativistic langevin simulation@xcite using an ( elliptic ) thermal fireball expansion for ( semi- ) central au - au collisions at rhic as a background medium , where the bulk flow is adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations in accordance with experiment . at the end of the qgp phase ( which terminates in a mixed phase at @xmath33@xmath1180mev ) ,",
    "the @xmath11- and @xmath18-quark output distributions from the langevin simulation are subjected to hadronization into @xmath50- and @xmath51-mesons using the quark - coalescence model of ref .",
    "since the probability for coalescence is proportional to the light - quark distribution functions , it preferentially occurs at lower @xmath6 ; `` left - over '' heavy quarks are hadronized via @xmath61-function fragmentation . the extra contribution to momentum and @xmath16 from the light",
    "quarks _ increases both _ the @xmath62 and @xmath9 of the heavy - meson spectra , relative to a scheme with fragmentation only .",
    "rescattering in the hadronic phase has been neglected .",
    "the resulting @xmath50- and @xmath51-meson spectra are decayed semileptonically resulting in a nuclear suppression factor and elliptic flow which compare reasonably well with recent rhic data@xcite up to @xmath6@xmath45gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig_elec ] ) .    at higher momenta , radiative energy loss ( not included here )",
    "is expected to contribute significantly .",
    "another issue in interpreting the semileptonic @xmath19 spectra concerns the relative contributions of charm and bottom .",
    "since bottom quarks are much less affected by rescattering effects , their contribution reduces the effects in both @xmath63 and @xmath16 appreciably . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we have determined the initial charm spectra by reproducing @xmath50- and @xmath64-spectra in d - au collisions@xcite , calculated the pertinent @xmath19 spectra and assigned the missing yield relative to the data@xcite to bottom contributions . in this way , the crossing between charm and bottom contribution in @xmath15-@xmath15 collisions occurs at @xmath6@xmath45gev . due to the strong quenching of the @xmath11-quark spectra in the qgp this",
    "crossing is shifted down to @xmath6@xmath42.5 - 3gev in au - au collisions . for charm contributions",
    "only , our nonperturbative rescattering mechanism results in a pertinent electron @xmath63 as low as 0.1 and an elliptic flow as large as 14% .",
    "thus , the severeness of the `` @xmath19 puzzle '' partially hinges on the baseline spectra in more elementary systems ( @xmath15-@xmath15 and d - au ) .",
    "obviously , a direct measurement of @xmath50-mesons in au - au would be very valuable .",
    "heavy quarkonia ( @xmath11-@xmath65 and @xmath18-@xmath66 bound states ) have long been identified as suitable objects to quantitatively investigate the properties of qcd , including color confinement@xcite .",
    "a particularly appealing feature is the applicability of potential models as a nonrelativistic effective - theory approximation to qcd ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . in the vacuum ,",
    "the heavy - quarkonium spectrum is indeed reasonably well described by the `` cornell potential '' , consisting of a coulomb plus linear confining term .",
    "subsequently it was realized that , when immersing quarkonia into a medium of deconfined color charges , debye screening will reduce the binding and eventually lead to the dissolution of the bound state@xcite ; already slightly above @xmath33 , a substantial ( factor @xmath82 - 3 ) reduction in charmonium and bottomonium binding energies , @xmath67 , has been found , together with the possibility that the ( @xmath68-wave ) ground states ( @xmath69 , @xmath31 , @xmath70 ) survive ( well ) above @xmath33 .",
    "modern lqcd ( -based ) calculations qualitatively support this picture : on the one hand , directly extracted charmonium spectral functions ( in quenched approximation ) indicate resonance peaks up to @xmath82@xmath33@xcite . on the other hand ,",

    ", a quantitative description of in - medium modifications of quarkonia requires at least two additional components , i.e. , the effects of parton - induced dissociation reactions and of in - medium hq masses .",
    "the objective is thus to construct an approach that ( i ) is consistent with finite-@xmath29 lqcd and ( ii ) allows for reliable applications to observables in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "only then the original idea@xcite of using quarkonia as a tool to identify ( and characterize ) confinement ( or at least color screening ) may be realized .",
    "the interplay of medium effects becomes more transparent in terms of the charmonium propagator , schematically written as ( nonrelativistic ) ) in this form implies that the @xmath52-@xmath76 potential is strong enough to generate a pole in the scattering amplitude .",

    "<S> in the first part of the talk , we briefly review the problem of parton - energy loss and thermalization at the relativistic heavy - ion collider and discuss how heavy quarks ( charm and bottom ) can help to resolve the existing experimental and theoretical puzzles . </S>",
    "<S> the second part of the talk is devoted to the properties of heavy quarkonia in the ( strongly interacting ) quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) and their consequences for observables in heavy - ion collisions . </S>"
