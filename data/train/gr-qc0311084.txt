    "although the methods and techniques have been greatly improved since the late nineteenth century , the precision on the measurement of the gravitational constant , g , is still the less accurate in comparison with the other fundamental constants of nature @xcite .",
    "moreover , given the relative uncertainties of most of the individual experiments ( reaching about @xmath0 for the most precise measurements ) , they show an incompatibility which leads to an overall precision of only about 1 part in @xmath1 .",
    "thus the current status of the @xmath2 terrestrial measurements ( see @xcite ) implies either an unknown source of errors ( not taken into account in the published uncertainties ) , or some new physics @xcite . in the latter spirit",
    ", many theories which include extradimensions have been proposed as candidates for the unification of physics . as such",
    ", they involve a coupling between gravitation and electromagnetism ( ge coupling ) , as well as with other gauge fields present .",
    "+ here we show that the discrepancy between the present results of the g - measurements may be understood as a consequence of the ge coupling .",
    "also , this theory predicts a variation of the effective fine structure `` constant '' @xmath3 with the gravitational field , and thus with the cosmological time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an argument initially from landau and lifshitz @xcite may be applied to the pure kaluza - klein ( kk ) action ( see @xcite ) : the negative sign of the kinetic term of the five dimensional ( 5d ) kk internal scalar field , @xmath4 , leads to inescapable instability . the question to know which of the two conformally related frames ( einstein - pauli frame or jordan - fierz frame ) is the best remains debated in the literature , each frame having its own advantage .",
    "the negative kinetic energy density for the @xmath4-field , and thus the instability , occur in both frames . in the following ,",
    "we perform calculations in the jordan - fierz frame , where , as we show , the discrepant laboratory measurements of g find a natural explanation .",
    "also , it is true that the 5d kk theory may yield a zero kinetic term ( and thus a zero kinetic energy density , which would also be unusual in 4d ) , but this occurs only when the electromagnetic ( em ) field is identically zero everywhere .",
    "this may be relevant for some cosmological solutions , but not for our discussion .",
    "on the contrary , we argue here that the @xmath4-field is tightly related to the em field via the link between the compactified space of the fifth dimension and the u(1 ) gauge group .",
    "since stabilization may be obtained if an external field is present , we assume here a version , kk@xmath5 , which includes an external bulk scalar field minimally coupled to gravity ( like the radion in the brane world scenario ) .",
    "after dimensional reduction ( @xmath6 ) , this bulk field reduces to a four dimensional scalar field @xmath7 and , in the jordan - fierz frame , the low energy effective action takes the form ( up to a total divergence ) @xmath8 \\,d^{4}x\\ ] ] @xmath9 \\,d^{4}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the potential 4-vector of the em field , @xmath11 the em field strength tensor , @xmath12 the self - interaction potential of @xmath5 of the symmetry breaking type and @xmath13 its source term .",
    "the source term of the @xmath5-field , @xmath13 , includes the contributions of the ordinary matter , of the em field and of the internal scalar field @xmath4 . for each",
    ", the coupling is defined by a function ( temperature dependent , as for the potential @xmath12 ) @xmath14 , where the subscript @xmath15 stands for `` matter '' , `` em '' and `` @xmath4 '' .",
    "in addition , the necessity to recover the einstein - maxwell equations in the weak fields limit , implies the following conditions : @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the @xmath5-field .",
    "the contributions of matter and @xmath4 are proportional to the traces of their respective energy - momentum tensors .",
    "a contribution of the form @xmath19 accounts for the coupling with the em field . besides ,",
    "though the fit to the data involves @xmath20 , we may infer that @xmath21 is negligibly small at very high temperature ( _ e.g. _ , like in the core of the sun or at the big bang nucleosynthesis ) and even vanishes beyond the critical temperature ( say @xmath22 k ) of the potential @xmath23 as one gets @xmath24 in that case .",
    "following lichnerowicz @xcite , let us interpret the quantity @xmath25 of the einstein - hilbert term , and the factor @xmath26 $ ] of the maxwell term respectively as the effective gravitational `` constant '' and the effective vacuum dielectric permittivity .",
    "the effective vacuum magnetic permeability reads @xmath27^{-1}$ ] , so that the velocity of light in vacuum remains a true universal constant .",
    "both terms depend on the local ( for local physics ) or global ( at cosmological scale ) value of the kk scalar field @xmath4 , assumed to be positive defined .",
    "the least action principle applied to the action ( [ kk action and psi j - f frame ] ) yields the generalized einstein - maxwell equations and the scalar fields equations @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "let us study the _ spatial _ variation of @xmath4 in the weak fields conditions out of the fields source , but in presence of a static dipolar magnetic field , @xmath30 .",
    "we denote @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively the radius from the centre , the azimuth angle and the colatitude .",
    "thus , writing @xmath34 , and taking into account that @xmath35 ( definition of the vev ) , equation ( [ kk scalar eq ] ) simplifies after linearization as @xmath36 \\ , ( \\,\\vec{\\nabla } v \\,)^{2}.\\ ] ] since @xmath37 and @xmath38 identically , the solution of equation ( [ stabilized kk scalar eq stat .",
    "approx ] ) above reads merely @xmath39 \\,v^{2}.\\ ] ]    for our purpose , it is sufficient to limit the expansion of the scalar potential , @xmath40 , to the terms of the legendre function of degree one ( @xmath41 ) and order one ( @xmath42 ) . hence @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the relevant gauss coefficients , @xmath47 is the earth s radius and @xmath48 denotes its magnetic moment . setting @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the solution of equation ( [ stabilized kk scalar eq stat .",
    "approx ] ) then reads ( and similarly for @xmath5 by making the substitution @xmath52 ) @xmath53 where we have set @xmath54 thence , one derives the expression of @xmath55 by inserting the solution ( [ stabilized kk scalar sol .",
    "1st approx ] ) above in relation ( [ g eff ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the magnetic potential , @xmath40 , scales as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the magnitude of the geomagnetic field at radius @xmath31 . indeed , because of this scaling effect , the small spatial variations of the geomagnetic field will influence significantly the laboratory measurements of g whereas the large local magnetic fields present in the laboratory ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , the magnetic suspension used to support the balance beam , the magnetic damper , etc ... ) will not .",
    "a rough estimate shows that , even using a 30 tesla superconducting magnet , one still needs to gain at least one order of magnitude with the most precise g measuring apparatus avalaible yet .",
    "hence , our prediction is consistent with the earlier conclusion of lloyd @xcite .",
    "there are presently almost 45 results of g measurements published since 1942 @xcite .",
    "because of the too numerous uncontrolled systematic biases , the mine measurements are excluded from the present study ( including them will not change our fit because of their lack of precision , typically less than @xmath58 ) . also , the more discordant laboratory measurement ( high ptb value @xcite ) is excluded , since it may suffer from a systematic effect .",
    "the `` official '' values are presently @xmath59 ( codata 86 , @xcite ) and @xmath60 ( codata 2000 , @xcite ) in mks unit .",
    "in the following , all the measurements are weighted equally in the fit .",
    "fitting the 44 data with these values gives respectively @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 per degrees of freedom ) .",
    "if we forget the official values and try a best fit , assuming an arbitrary constant value of @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the fit to the same sample of 44 measurements ( figure 1 ) , on account of the ge coupling , yields ( in mks units ) with @xmath66 : @xmath67 from the above fit , one derives both estimates of the true gravitational constant @xmath68 and the coupling parameter @xmath69 the latter quantity , expressed in the canonical form @xmath70 , yields a 5d planck scale @xmath71  tev of the order of the value that is invoked in the literature to solve the hierarchy problem .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   + table 2 : reduced @xmath72 for the two different hypothesis h0 ( hypothesis of a constant @xmath2 ) and h1 ( hypothesis of an effective g ) , and different samples s1 and whole ( except the high ptb value @xcite , see text ) .",
    "+ considering the whole sample , we check the relevance of our result under h1 compared to the best value of @xmath2 under h0 , by applying the f test ( fisher law ) .",
    "this yields @xmath73 , which indicates that , independently of the number of parameters ( two instead of one ) , our fit is better with a significance level greater than @xmath74 @xcite . let us emphasize that the most precise value of g today @xcite contributes to @xmath75 to less than @xmath76 in the above fit . likewise , the last published value of g @xcite would contribute to less than @xmath77 .",
    "this suggests that the agreement may be better than purely indicated by the @xmath78 values .",
    "moreover , if one substitutes @xmath79",
    "@xcite announced by the msl team in june 2002 ( cpem , ottawa , canada ) for the prior @xmath80 published in 1999  @xcite , one would obtain with the sample s1 :    h0 : @xmath81    h1 : @xmath82    and with the whole sample of 44 measurements :    h0 : @xmath83    h1 : @xmath84",
    "it is worth noticing that the scalar fields under considerations identify neither to the dilaton nor to the inflaton of higher dimensional theories , without further assumptions . in particular",
    ", the computation of both scalar fields , as given by equations ( [ ext . scalar field eq ] ) and ( [ kk scalar eq ] ) , involves only ( see the right hand sides ) quantities related to fields sources , and not to the test bodies .",
    "hence , the effective @xmath85 given by relation ( [ g eff ] ) does not depend on the composition of the test bodies .",
    "besides , let us emphasize that the equation of motion of a neutral point - like particle in the genuine kk theory reduces to the 4d geodesic equation after dimensional reduction  @xcite , although the kk scalar field is coupled to the maxwell invariant @xmath86 . in a forthcoming paper  @xcite , we address the effect of the varying effective coupling constants on the masses of composit particles . on account of the higgs mechanism of quarks and leptons masses generation , by promoting the yukawa coupling constants to effective parameters ( on an equal footing with @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) that depend on both scalar fields @xmath5 and @xmath4 , we prove that the kk@xmath5 model is actually consistent with the current experimental bounds on the violation of the equivalence principle . hence , we conclude that present laboratory experiments may not measure a true constant of gravitation . instead , in addition to all other possible biases ( _ e .",
    "anelasticity in the wire of torsion pendulum as pointed out by kuroda @xcite , and which since has been generically taken into account in the experiments ) , they may be pointing out an effective one depending on the geomagnetic field at the laboratory position .",
