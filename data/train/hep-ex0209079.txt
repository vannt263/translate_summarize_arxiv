    "one of the most important observables in particle production processes is _ multiplicity _ , i.e. the number of particles ( mostly , hadrons ) produced in the collision @xcite . the multiplicity dependence on the energy scale , species of particles , event flavour content are among the main predictions of the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the multiplicity is used to select or to describe events , e.g. as a trigger for specific processes , as an input for kinematic variables spectra .",
    "the distribution of multiplicity , its mean value and multiplicity fluctuations are the essential characteristics of the collision dynamics .",
    "however , the multiplicity distribution tells us just about the averaged , integrated numbers , while deeper information comes from the moments of the distribution , which measure particle _ correlations _ , i.e. probe the interaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "here , i report on the multiplicity flavour dependence , on the analyses of local multiplicity fluctuations and multiparticle correlations .",
    "these studies provide us with details of strong interactions and allow us to estimate the level of the applicability of qcd , based on the partonic picture , to the production of hadrons which are the experimentally observed objects .",
    "the multiplicity distribution , or the density @xmath0 , of multiplicity @xmath1 of particles with kinematic variables @xmath2 is defined by the inclusive probability spectrum , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of events .",
    "as it follows from this formula , the single particle distribution @xmath5 gives an _ average _ multiplicity , @xmath6 , while integration of the @xmath7-particle densities leads to the unnormalised @xmath7th order _ factorial moments _",

    "the cumulants vanish whenever one of their arguments is statistically independent , i.e. these functions measure _ genuine _",

    "in studies of local fluctuations and correlations , i.e those in phase - space bins , one uses the _ bin - averaged _ factorial moments and cumulants .",

    "in this section , i consider the recent results on hadron multiplicities from fragmentation of heavy and light quarks delbl , opallq , opalbl .",
    "the study of the quark content in multiparticle production provides one of the basic tests of qcd .",
    "the results from lep are of a special interest since they cover a wide centre - of - mass energy region and can be directly compared with qcd which is mostly predictable at the asymptotic energies qcdrev .    , between heavy and light quark pairs as a function of centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the dashed - dotted line is the combined result from all measurements , see ref .",

    "delbl and opalbl , a study of the fragmentation of heavy b - quark and light quarks ( l = u , d , s ) is performed . the measurements of the difference in charge particle multiplicities , @xmath26 , for @xmath27 and @xmath28 events in e@xmath29e@xmath30 annihilation at the centre - of - mass energies above the z@xmath31 peak are carried out .",
    "the findings are compared to the theoretical predictions of qcd and to a more phenomenological ( the so - called nave ) model ( for review , see ref .",
    "the qcd calculations predict energy - independent behaviour of the multiplicity difference @xmath32 , while in the nave model one expects the decrease with increasing energy .",
    "the latter is connected with the assumption that the hadron multiplicity accompanying the heavy hadrons in @xmath33 events is the same as the multiplicity in @xmath34 events at the energy left to the system once the heavy quarks have fragmented .",
    "the difference between the heavy and light mean quark - pair multiplicities obtained by delphi at 206 gev is @xmath35 opalbl , while opal finds @xmath36 in the energy range of 130  206 gev opalbl .",
    "the difference in the values is connected with some differences in the data processing procedure . in the meantime , the results of the energy - dependence is found to be the same for the both studies : the mean multiplicity difference is energy - independent and favours the qcd predictions while it is inconsistent with the flavour - independent nave model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : opalbl ] ) .",
    "also in agreement with qcd is the ratio between light quark multiplicities , @xmath37 , where i , j = \\{u , d , s } , as obtained by opal at the z@xmath31 peak energy opallq . to note",
    "is that the @xmath38 and @xmath39 are highly statistically anti - correlated ( @xmath40% ) which is due to their fractions in k - mesons .",
    "during the last decades , the phase - space local multiplicity fluctuations are actively studied in many reactions , from leptonic to nuclear collisions , and the intermittency scaling of the fluctuations has been established cfrep .",
    "all the studies show that the intermittency is more pronounced in high dimensions , while in one dimension ( e.g. , in rapidity ) the effect is diluted by projection onto one dimension .",
    "this leads to flattenning of the factorial moments .",
    "such a behaviour is well understood from a qcd parton shower which is a three - dimensional branching and naturally leads to the fractality . the best area to study the effect and its connection with qcd",
    "is given by e@xmath29e@xmath30 annihilation , where such investigations has been performed earlier cfrep , del3d , opal3d and new analysis is carried out by l3 l3sa .",
    "the l3 analysis gives us further hints about the intermittency origin , which is currently far from understanding .",
    "the new study employs the fact that so far the fluctuations in many dimensions were studied with the same number @xmath17 of bins in each dimension / direction .",
    "this leads to self-_similar _ fractals , i.e. the fluctuations in any direction are assumed to be the same , or _",
    "isotropic_. in case when the dynamics in different directions are not equivalent , the fluctuations become _ anisotropic _ and this tells us about the self-_affinity _ liu .",
    "a self - affine behaviour has been observed in hadronic interactions liu , while a self - similar scaling has been qualitatively confirmed in e@xmath29e@xmath30 annihilation opal3d . in terms of factorial moments ,",
    "eq.([nfm ] ) , the 3-dimensional moments are expected to exhibit the intermittency property in e@xmath29e@xmath30 collisions when phase - space is partitioned isotropically , while this scaling in hadronic interactions only occurs for anisotropic partitioning .    ) , as a function of the number @xmath17 of bins in the randomised and the thrust frames compared to the monte carlo predictions with and without bose - einstein correlations .",

    "the 2-jet sub - samples are also analysed using the durham jet algorithm .",
    "the fluctuations in the 2-jet events show the self - affine ( anisotropic ) fluctuations .",

    "the like - sign cumulants increase faster and drive the all - charge ones at small bins while the unlike - sign cumulants are almost constant .",
    "this points to the likely influence of bose - einstein correlations .",
    "the comparison between the data and monte carlo like - sign cumulants shows that the model describes well the data when bose - einstein correlations are implemented . the same is true for the all - charge cumulants ( not shown here ) .",
    "this is not the case of the l3 results where no difference is found for the models with and without bose - einstein correlations , see fig .",
    "[ fig : l3sa ] . to note",
    "is that the opal data is described well in one dimension as well as in three dimensions .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : opal13c ] , one can see that bose - einstein correlations which are implemented in the model as the correlations of _ two _ identical particles and are pair - wise adjusted , well also describe the cumulants of @xmath57 .",
    "this suggests to consider the interdependence of the 2nd- and higher - order cumulants , fig .",
    "[ fig : owk ] .",
    "the fit akin to the ochs - wosiek one cfrep gives the same parameter values for the all - charge and like - sign cumulants , while disagrees with the negative binomial predictions .",

    "the differential spectra of @xmath58 particles in pseudorapidity bins are analysed relative to the similar background spectra .",
    "the dips in the distributions of such ratios are found to be independent on the number @xmath58 of particles , @xmath59 .",
    "the number of clusters is estimated to be about 2 - 3 with two particles per cluster in average .",
    "it is found that the data in the non - annihilation channel is similar to that from the inelastic pp collisions at 69 gev/@xmath56 from the same accelerator .",
    "these observations are treated in frames of different mechanisms , e.g. a model with mesons emitted from intermediate nucleon isobars is suggested .",
