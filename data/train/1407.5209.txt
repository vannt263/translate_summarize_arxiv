    "it is worth to mention here that though the first excited state is a singlet at 1.87 mev , there is no transition from the ground state to the first excited state , the matrix element is zero , the nonzero matrix elements for the transitions from ground state to the excited states are obtained only for the transitions shown by arrows in fig .",
    "thus at temperatures close to the freezing temperature , which is well below 155 k ( 13.41 mev ) , prrusi@xmath2 is effectively a two - level system . the specific heat calculated with the crystal field scheme presented in fig .",

    "the vertical dotted line shows @xmath4 = 0.32 mev for prrusi@xmath0 , which gives ordering temperature @xmath24 11.5 k that is very close to peak in the susceptibility at 9.8 k.,width=321 ]    now let us discuss the @xmath1sr finding of weak moment taking into consideration that the prrusi@xmath0 has a singlet ground state as deduced from inelastic neutron scattering and specific heat measurements . for a singlet ground state system",
    "the existence of magnetic order critically depends on the ratio @xmath93 , where @xmath4 is the heisenberg exchange interaction and @xmath92 is the crystal field splitting energy between the ground state and the excited state coupled by the matrix element @xmath94 .",
    "@xcite above a critical value of @xmath93 system undergoes a self - induced spontaneous ordering . the mean - field critical temperature below which self - induced moment forms spontaneously in a two - level system is given by @xcite @xmath95 \\right\\}^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the degeneracy of the excited state and @xmath94 is the the matrix element between the ground state singlet and excited state doublet . a plot of the @xmath91 calculated from this expression as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath33 = 2 , @xmath96 = 9.58 and @xmath92 = 2.45 mev is shown in fig .",
    "18 . from fig .",
    "18 it follows that the exchange energy must be @xmath4 = 0.30 mev for prrusi@xmath2 to have an induced moment ordering below @xmath91 = 9.8 k. a rough estimate of @xmath4 following the approach used to estimate the @xmath4 for pr in reference 29 , i.e. using @xmath97 and @xmath98 , yields @xmath4 = 0.32 for prrusi@xmath2 which is very close to the mean - field required value of @xmath4 for an induced moment magnetic ordering below 9.8 k. therefore this clearly suggests that prrusi@xmath0 undergoes an induced moment ordering below 9.8 k. the value of @xmath99 = 0.122 for prrusi@xmath0 is comparable but little higher than the corresponding @xmath99 = 0.085 for prau@xmath3si@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , as in the case of prau@xmath3si@xmath3 , if the exchange coupling is very close to the critical value required to induce the magnetic order , the dynamic fluctuations of crystal field levels can destabilize the induced moment long range magnetic order resulting in a frustrated ground state , i.e. spin - glass type behavior .",
    "the dynamic fluctuations of crystal field levels is the leading mechanism for spin - glass behavior in prau@xmath3si@xmath3 . @xcite for our system prrusi@xmath0 it seems that the j@xmath100/@xmath92 is higher than the critical value , resulting in an induced magnetic order as sensed by @xmath1sr , however the value of @xmath99 is not high enough to be unaffected by the dynamic fluctuations of crystal field levels and a frustrated ground state is realized together with induced moment magnetism .",
    "the two contradictory ground states , spin - glass and magnetic order , can be explained if the dynamic fluctuation time of the induced moment is smaller than the muon probing time window . in this case , the muon will observe the presence of an internal field , whereas the magnetization will observe the spin - glass behavior .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic and transport properties of prrusi@xmath0 using various experimental techniques .",
    "our dc and ac magnetization studies reveal the signatures of non - canonical spin - glass behavior in this compound with the freezing temperature @xmath17 @xmath24 9.8 k. the thermo - remnant magnetization in spin - glass state is found to relax with a very high mean relaxation time @xmath32 = 13357 s. the magnetic and thermal properties are strongly influenced by the crystal field effect that manifest as a broad anomaly in the specific heat and electric resistivity .",
    "the @xmath1sr data show the presence of long range magnetic ordering below 12 k with very small internal field at the muon site .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering confirms a singlet cef ground state and a possibility of the induced moment magnetism arising from the excited cef doublet at 2.45 mev in the presence of strong exchange in prrusi@xmath0 .",
    "the cef level scheme of prrusi@xmath0 is very similar to that of prau@xmath3si@xmath3 in which the spin - glass behavior arising from the dynamic fluctuations of the crystal field levels has been observed .",
    "this leads us to believe that the origin of spin - glass behavior in prrusi@xmath2 lies in the dynamic fluctuations of crystal field levels .",
    "considering the two contradictory ground states of prrusi@xmath0 , spin - glass behavior seen in the magnetization and specific heat study and long range ordering observed in the @xmath1sr study , we suspect that the time of dynamic fluctuations of the induced moments is smaller than the muon probing time window , therefore muon observes the presence of an internal field and hence the ordered state , whereas the magnetization observes the spin - glass behavior .",
    "further , the value of the transition temperature of prsusi@xmath0 increases with frequency of the probe , i.e. , the ac susceptibility shows the peak at 10 k ( at 10 khz ) , while muon frequency in mhz shows the highest ordering temperature at 12 k. thus the overall behavior of prrusi@xmath0 leads us to characterize it as an induced moment spin - glass system , however further investigations preferably on single crystals are highly desired to understand better the mechanism of spin - glass behavior and induced moment magnetism in this well crystallographically ordered compound ."
