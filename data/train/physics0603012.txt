    "the existence of stylized facts suggests that price trails of different financial markets might be regarded as different realizations of a more general stochastic system , called the financial market. if so then the question is about the nature of this system .",
    "since prices are macro - observables of a financial market , the model about price dynamics is defined on the macro level . due to the set of assumptions used in its derivation ,",
    "this model is an approximation in itself , see @xcite .",
    "three major properties estimated there were the distribution of ( logarithmic ) asset returns , the spectrum of hurst exponents of their time series , and finally two entropy measures , the renyi entropy and the tsallis entropy .",
    "although the model is a zero - order approximation , theoretical results agree with real data .",
    "first - order corrections concerning the set of assumptions made should improve these theoretical findings .",
    "an important feature the old model was not able to capture is the ( slight ) skewness .",
    "in fact , if trading happens along a sequence of independent trading periods , i.e. opening prices are independent from closing price of the former trading period , the the distribution of returns is symmetric - in contrary to empirical data .",
    "in fact the assumption that opening prices are independent from closing prices is economically unreasonable .",
    "if each period is one day at an exchange , then there is night between closing time and opening time . while on the one hand , many things can happen during the night time , it is not reasonable that the next opening price is independent from the price at the former closing time . in the contrary",
    "we assume that successive trading periods are dependent from each in that the opening price of each period equals the closing price of its former trading period .",
    "+ to recapitulate the basic idea of our model : people go to the financial market to let their money work. they do so by investing their money into assets .",
    "if the agent has capital @xmath1 to invest in asset @xmath2 , he can buy @xmath3 units of this asset for its price @xmath4 .",
    "a unit of this asset has an uncertain value @xmath5 some time later for the corresponding adapted stochastic process . ] .",
    "hence at this time , the money @xmath1 invested in asset @xmath2 has value @xmath6 .",
    "if the agent is lucky , then at the expiration time @xmath7 , and his money @xmath8 has become more valuable by a factor [ lambda ] _",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the agent wants to spend his money in an asset of which he expects that @xmath9 .",
    "thus , depending on his expectation about the future value of @xmath10 the agents buys or sells this asset . therefore , if the agent expects that @xmath11 , he will buy , otherwise he will sell .",
    "this causes an increase ( decrease ) of demand in this asset . due to the increase ( decrease ) of demand ,",
    "the price will rise ( fall ) .",
    "thus the growth rate of the price process is some function of the recently expected gain @xmath12 .",
    "+ the physical time interval @xmath13 is divided into intervals marking trading periods @xmath14 , where @xmath15 can be regarded as its opening time and @xmath16 as its closing time . considering daily prices , it might be suggestive to think that a trading period lasts for one day , from the opening of the exchange to its closing .",
    "two periods are then separated by night time , in which no trade but a lot can happen .",
    "@xmath17 denoting the price by a function @xmath18 , we say that @xmath19 is the opening price of period @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the closing price of this period .",
    "trading periods can be dependent or independent in the sense that , in the first case , the closing price @xmath22 equals the opening price of the next period @xmath23 .",
    "if periods are independent , the price evolution is an ensemble property of a 1-period model defined for a single period which arbitrary initial prices @xmath18 , so that the price process becomes quasi - stationary. otherwise price evolution is described by a multiplicative process in time given by [ x ] x_t+1 = ( _ t ) x_t . where the growth rate @xmath24 is assumed to be an increasing function of @xmath12 .",
    "the model and its analysis considered here is based on the following four assumptions :    1 .",
    "the financial market contains only 1 asset ; 2 .",
    "trading periods are _ dependent _ ; 3 .",
    "payoffs are uniformly distributed within a fixed finite interval ; 4 .",
    "the growth rate @xmath25 is a power law with a constant scaling exponent @xmath0 , i.e. [ phi ] ( ) = ^ = x^- , > 0 .",
    "as seen , compared with the model in in @xcite , the only difference is in assumption 2 , i.e. trading periods are no longer independent from each other . as we will see",
    "this will induce asymmetry in the system .",
    "@xmath0 acts as a zooming factor in that , if @xmath26 , the growth rate gives highest weight to price fluctuations on a small level , while if @xmath27 , price fluctuations on a high level are more important .",
    "this is since @xmath28 and hence for @xmath29 , @xmath30 second , if @xmath31 , then negative returns are more probable than positive returns , and _ vice versa _ : recall that , given two successive prices @xmath32 , the return @xmath33 yields @xmath34 consequently , @xmath35 which is solved by @xmath36 therefore , if @xmath31 , negative returns @xmath37 are more probable than positive returns .",
    "taking both arguments together this gives the following picture : talking about expectations , the parameter @xmath0 can be regarded as a preference parameter in the sense that if @xmath26 the agent puts more weight on low level price fluctuations . on the other hand , if @xmath38 the agent puts more weight on high level price fluctuations . on the other hand @xmath0 can be regarded as an asymmetry parameter : if @xmath39 , there exists an asymmetry in the model , which then is reflected in the skewness of returns . in this sense ,",
    "skewness - negative for @xmath31 and positive for @xmath38 , is a consequence of differently weighting price fluctuations that happen on different levels .",
    "this argumentation can be made precise by considering price evolution as a process , i.e. assuming that @xmath40 , in which using equations [ lambda ] , [ x ] , and [ phi ] , consecutive prices are related by [ model ] x_t+1 = _",
    "t ^x_t^1- .",
    "logarithmic prices @xmath41 then satisfy the difference equation @xmath42 , whose generating function - for @xmath43 - yields f_(s ) = _ t1 the coefficients @xmath44 of its taylor expansion in @xmath45 obey @xmath46 and hence @xmath47 is obtained from [ zalpha ] z_(t ) = c_(t)- c_(t-1 ) . if @xmath48 , @xmath49 , expansion of @xmath50 in equation [ zalpha ] around @xmath51 up to first order in @xmath0 then gives z_(t ) & = & ( ^1-a_t ^2a-1_t-1 ^-a_t-2 ) + ( a^2 ) @xmath52 is the sum of the following random variables @xmath53 derived from @xmath54 , @xmath55 with probabilities @xmath56 respectively @xmath57 where normalization constants yield @xmath58 .",
    "since the @xmath53 are independent , the probability density of the compound variable @xmath52 is the convolution of the densities of the compound variables , i.e. f_z ( z ) & = & \\ {    ll c_1 c_2 ( f_y_1 f_y_2)(z ) & z > 0 + c_0 f_y_0(z ) & z 0 .    .",
    "thus , up to a normalization for @xmath59 , the distribution is given by [ asymdistr ] f_z ( z ) = \\ {    lr e^- & z0 + e^ & z 0 .    .",
    ", therefore , in a semi - logarithmic plot we see a tent - with an exponential correction for small @xmath60 - according to @xmath61    1.5 cm    ( 60,40 ) ( 0,5)(38,30 ) ( -16,18)@xmath62 ( 25,25)@xmath63 ( 8,25)@xmath64 ( 18,30)(1,-1)16 ( 16,30)(-1,-2)7 ( 19,0)@xmath65 ( -3,30)@xmath65 ( 33,0)@xmath60    1.5 cm    ( 60,40 ) ( 0,5)(38,30 ) ( -16,18)@xmath62 ( 23,30)(1,-2)6 ( 21,30)(-1,-1)16 ( 21,0)@xmath65 ( -3,30)@xmath65 ( 33,0)@xmath60    for @xmath66 the distribution is symmetric .",
    "[ symdistr ] f_z_1(z ) = - 2 - | z | . if @xmath67 @xmath68 , positive returns are less probable than in the symmetric case , while if @xmath69 , @xmath70 , positive returns are more probable .",
    "hence a positive @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath31 , relates to negative skewness while @xmath38 corresponds to positive skewness .",
    "this is in contratst to the case where trading periods all independent , since there the distribution is symmetric for all @xmath0 , see @xcite f_z_(z ) = - ( 2 ) - > 0 .",
    "given our model , one would like to estimate the parameter @xmath0 from data .",
    "the obvious method is to compare the distributions of positive and negative returns : since @xmath72 and @xmath73 , this would give @xmath74 a better way to approximately estimate @xmath0 uses the moments of the distribution . for small @xmath0",
    "we consider the case that @xmath75 .",
    "then , according to equation [ asymdistr ] , the distribution yields @xmath76 whose normalization constant @xmath77 for small @xmath71 , so that @xmath78 . its raw moments @xmath79 of the distribution follow from its characteristic function @xmath80 according to @xmath81 , from which central moments @xmath82 are obtained as their binomial transforms @xmath83 .",
    "the skewness of the distribution then is [ skewness ] _",
    "1 = - a + o(a^2 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath0 can be estimated from data by @xmath84 the accuracy of the model can be estimated by inserting @xmath85 back into equation [ skewness ] and to compare the true ( empirical ) skewness @xmath86 with the skewness @xmath87 estimated on the basis of our model .",
    "both are compared by @xmath88 , see table [ alphas ] .    .[alphas",

    "there is actually one exception which is the dax .",
    "it should be further noted that the hang seng and the nasdaq contain assets with very high skewness . for them",
    "our low order approximation becomes poor , of course .",

    "the aim is understand basic principles of price formation on a financial market in terms of a simple model .",
    "while the mechanism proposed might seem to be plausible , only the comparison with real data can judge about the feasibility of this model .",
    "+ in @xcite we proposed a simple model for endogenous price formation on the macro level .",
    "this model and its analysis was based on a series of assumptions .",
    "this made the model a zero - order approximation .",
    "comparison with real data showed that the proposed model did already a good job . on the other hand ,",
    "its limitations were clearly seen , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "the logically next step was to modify the made assumptions step for step to see whether the model is enhanced .",
    "one important feature , the previous model was not able to reproduce , was the ( slight ) skewness of the distribution of asset returns seen in empirical data .",
    "our previous analysis was concerned with the setting that all trading periods are independent from each other . in this case",
    "the return distribution was always symmetric .",
    "the analysis was based on the assumption that trading periods were independent from each other .",
    "the assumption that successive trading periods are independent from each other was not reasonable : opening prices are not independent from closing price of the former trading period .",
    "thus we substituted our initial assumption that trading periods are independent by the assumption that the opening price equals the closing price of the former period .",
    "thus price evolution now became a process in time .",
    "the analysis in this note shows that , if the trading periods are dependent from each other , the return distribution is skew .",
    "the only parameter @xmath0 of our model can be regarded as an _ asymmetry parameter_. if @xmath31 , the distribution is negatively skewed , while if @xmath38 , it is positively skewed . only for @xmath66 , the distribution is symmetric . + in economic terms @xmath0 can be given other interpretation .",
    "following [ reimann2006 ] , the parameter @xmath0 might de understood as the long - term averaged _ liquidity _ of an asset .",
    "the discussion in section 1.1 additionally suggests an interpretation in term of _ preferences_. the decision to buy or to sell the asset depends on the agents believe about the future growth rate of the value of the asset .",
    "this depends on both , the recent price level and the fluctuations on this level . as the discussion in section 1.1 shows , if @xmath31 , then the agent puts more weight on price fluctuations on a low level , while otherwise , price fluctuations on a high level are more important .",
    "this induces an asymmetry due to deviations of @xmath0 from @xmath102 .",
    "this interpretation implies that the skewness of empirical asset returns are due to an asymmetric preference in the agents decision .",
    "+ the next question was how much of the observed skewness of a empirical return distribution can be explained as a consequence of considering trading as process ?",
    "we therefore estimated the skewness parameter @xmath0 from data and calculated the skewness that our model would generate given this parameter .",
    "this theoretical skewness was then compared with the empirical skewness in the data .",
    "it turned out that a huge amount of empirical skewness is quite well described by our model , in which the price dynamics are a process !",
