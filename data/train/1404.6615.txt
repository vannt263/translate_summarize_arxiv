    "critical points in a phase diagram in the temperature - density plane are special for several reasons . starting from their rarity , only one or two in usual systems , to the various dramatic changes in a host of physical quantities at the critical point are the observations - based curiosities , while theoretically the universality of critical indices , diverging correlation length etc .",
    "enable us to relate widely different physical systems to the common underlying symmetries . for common substances , such as water or carbon dioxide ,",
    "the existence of critical point has been established experimentally , with its location known rather precisely .",
    "critical exponents for magnetic systems have been found experimentally to be equal to those for the many liquid - gas systems , and are related to the symmetry of the ising model . for many of the physical systems , however , getting a theoretical , especially first principles based , computation of their locations has turned out to be illusive still .",
    "the aim of this article is to describe how things are different for strongly interacting matter , which is naturally described by quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "qcd has an inherently a higher energy , and thus a shorter time , scale . whether the qcd phase diagram has a critical point in its temperature @xmath0 and the baryonic chemical potential @xmath1 plane is therefore a tougher question to address experimentally as well .",
    "thanks to the impressive developments on the experimental fronts , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl , new york , and the upcoming facilities such as fair at gsi , darmstadt and nica at dubna , russia may be able to search for it , and potentially even locate it .",
    "unlike its cousin qed quantum electrodynamics qcd turns out to be much richer in structure .",
    "while it can be handled theoretically in the ( almost ) same way as qed when the coupling between its constituents quarks and gluon is small , newer tools are needed in the strong coupling regime where a lot of the rich structure , such as quark confinement , exists .",
    "a variety of models have been developed to handle this domain , and have been tested successfully for hadronic interactions to a limited extent .",
    "these models were was also the first set of tools used for getting a glimpse of the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "for instance , using an effective chiral nambu - jana lasinio type model , a phase diagram was obtained , which suggests @xcite a critical point to exist in a world with two light quarks ( up and down flavours ) and one moderately heavier ( strange ) quark .",
    "one would clearly like to have an _ ab initio _ theoretical evidence for it from qcd directly .",
    "this turns out to be difficult as one has to deal with the strong coupling regime of qcd .",
    "non - perturbative lattice qcd , defined on a discrete space - time lattice , has proved itself to be the most reliable technique for extracting the information from qcd in the world of low energy hadronic interactions . the hadron spectrum has been computed and predictions of weak decay constants of heavy mesons have been made @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of lattice qcd using the importance sampling approach have been the backbone for all such computations . since use of these techniques",
    "was actually inspired by their success in statistical mechanics , it is natural to extend the same approach to finite temperature and finite density qcd .",
    "indeed , its application to finite temperature qcd has also yielded a slew of results for qcd thermodynamical observables , such as the pressure as a function of temperature .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether lattice qcd can help us in locating the qcd critical point .",
    "the prospect of finding the critical point experimentally makes it exciting both as a check of such theoretical predictions and as a competition for getting there first .",
    "clearly , in view of the complexity of the task , one could turn to lattice qcd again to see if it can provide any hints for the experimental search program as well . in this short review ,",
    "i aim to summarise the results obtained in this direction , including those by the tifr group , mumbai .",
    "lattice qcd simulations at finite density , or equivalently nonzero @xmath1 , have had to face to two severe problems , which have resulted in a slow progress in the field of qcd critical point .",
    "recently , one of them , a conceptual issue , appears to have been solved .",
    "let me explain that first .",
    "due to the well - known fermion doubling problem , one has to make a compromise in choosing the quark type for any lattice qcd computation .",
    "while the final results should be independent of the quark type , indeed any form of the lattice action , the choice of the quark type is often dictated by the nature of the task at hand .",
    "the popular choice in finite temperature and density studies has been mostly the kogut - susskind ( staggered ) quarks @xcite .",
    "they have an exact chiral symmetry at any value of the lattice spacing ( any finite cut - off ) which leads to an order parameter , the chiral condensate @xmath2 , for a lattice investigation in the entire @xmath0-@xmath1 plane . unfortunately though , the flavour and spin symmetry is broken for them on a lattice .",
    "a simulation relevant to experiments ought to have 2 light ( or 2 light + 1 heavier ) quark flavours .",
    "precisely such a representation for staggered quarks may not be feasible , more so on the coarse lattices one is constrained to employ .",
    "the existence of the critical point , on the other hand , is expected to depend crucially on the number of flavours .",
    "flavour and spin symmetry is therefore needed in simulations .",
    "although computationally much more expensive , domain wall or overlap fermions @xcite are better in this regard , as they do have the correct symmetries for any lattice spacing at zero temperature and density .",
    "introduction of chemical potential , @xmath3 , for these is , however , not straight - forward due to their non - locality . bloch and wettig @xcite proposed a way to do this .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out @xcite that their prescription breaks chiral symmetry . of course",
    ", a space - time lattice breaks even translational and rotational symmetry . exactly as these are expected to be restored in the continuum limit of vanishing lattice spacing , one may argue that the same would be the case for the bloch - wettig method .",
    "the problem is that for the chiral condensate to be an order parameter on a lattice , the chiral symmetry must be respected even on the lattice .",
    "otherwise cut - off dependent corrections to it would change it in an uncontrollable way .",
    "furthermore , the chiral anomaly for the bloch - wettig action depends on @xmath3 unlike in continuum qcd @xcite . as a result",
    ", it too may alter the existence / location of the critical point on the lattice .",
    "recently , this conceptual issue has been resolved @xcite by a new proposal to introduce the chemical potential for both overlap and domain wall fermions .",
    "it leads to a formalism with both a ) continuum - like ( chiral , flavour and spin ) symmetries for quarks at nonzero @xmath3 and @xmath0 and b ) a well - defined order parameter on the lattice .",
    "finite density simulations needed for locating a critical point suffer from another well known problem .",
    "it is inherited from the continuum theory itself : the fermion sign problem .",
    "it appears in areas of statistical mechanics also and has so far remained unsolved .",
    "it is a major stumbling block in extending the lattice techniques to the entire @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "simply stated , simulations rely on importance sampling due to the large number of field ( quark and gluon ) variables . assuming @xmath4 flavours of quarks , and denoting by @xmath5 the corresponding chemical potentials , the qcd partition function is    @xmath6    and the thermal expectation value of any observable @xmath7 is @xmath8    for a @xmath9 lattice , the simulations then correspond to a spatial volume of @xmath10 , and a temperature of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lattice spacing .",
    "quark masses and chemical potentials are then also in units of @xmath12 .",
    "typically , the integral above is   10 million dimensional and @xmath13 , the fermion matrix defined by the lattice dirac operator , is about a million @xmath14 million .",
    "probabilistic methods are therefore used to evaluate @xmath15 .",
    "these need a positive definite measure . from eq.(1 ) , one sees the measure to be proportional to the exponential of the gluonic action , @xmath16 and the fermionic determinant det@xmath17 . while the former factor is positive definite , for nonzero @xmath3 , the determinant turns out to be a complex number , although the partition function itself remains real .",
    "this is the fermion phase / sign problem in finite density qcd .",
    "note that the determinant is purely real for @xmath18 .",
    "several approaches have been proposed in the past to deal with it . in view of the space constraints , let me provide a partial list , with some comments :    1 .",
    "suitable choice of variables @xcite since the partition is still real , one can attempt suitable variable transformations to re - write it using variables which do not lead to a complex measure .",
    "the key here is , of course , to find such variables .",
    "this approach has been shown to work in simpler models or with some drastic approximations to qcd but so far remains a distant goal for realistic qcd simulations .",
    "2 .   imaginary chemical potential @xcite  substituting @xmath19 in the fermion determinant , one can easily verify that it becomes real .",
    "usual simulation methods then enable one to explore the imaginary @xmath3-axis . however ,",
    "the results so obtained can only be employed for our world after analytic continuation , which introduces unknown and uncontrollable errors .",
    "so far , it has been used for very coarse ( @xmath20 ) and with only the leading term in an polynomial ansatz for analytic continuation .",
    "no hints of qcd critical point were seen .",
    "it will be interesting to see how these results will be in the continuum limit and with more terms in the polynomial .",
    "canonical ensemble method @xcite  computations at a fixed baryon number do not have the fermion sign problem as well .",
    "using this idea , simulations on small lattices have been done with encouraging results .",
    "one needs to compute them in the limit of very large baryon number in order to obtain the corresponding chemical potential . until that is achieved",
    ", one can only make qualitative comparisons .",
    "the hints of a first order phase transition seen in these simulations are consistent with a possible critical point at some other , perhaps lower , @xmath3 .",
    "4 .   complex langevin approach @xcite  stochastic quantization of field theories aims to evaluate the @xmath15 by formulating the problem in terms of a langevin equation and by employing its ( simulation ) time evolution .",
    "it too , of course , needs the same reality and positivity condition .",
    "although , a formal proof does not exist for complex action , one may still hope that it converges to the correct answer .",
    "such attempts for some models have been shown to work , i.e. , they agree with the known exact / semi - analytic results but in some cases it is known to fail as well .",
    "currently attempts are being to made to understand this to see if it can be eventually applied to full qcd .",
    "5 .   two parameter re - weighting @xcite",
    " importance sampling , basic to many of the simulation methods , works by creating the most probable distribution of the action in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for given input parameters , such as the gauge coupling . exploiting cleverly the fact that such a distribution can be constructed for @xmath18 by using standard methods ,",
    "this approach consists of obtaining the desired @xmath21 distribution from the expectation values with respect to the former .",
    "fodor and katz @xcite were the first to obtain a lattice result for the qcd critical point on small and coarse lattices ( @xmath22 ) , which was found to be at @xmath23 .",
    "employing similar lattice but a realistic quark mass spectrum in @xcite , they obtained a critical point at a factor 2 lesser @xmath24 .",
    "extending this approach to larger and fine lattices appears not to be easy because of an exponential growth in the size of the computational resources needed due to the so - called ` overlap ' problem but would be nice if it could be done .",
    "taylor expansion @xcite  the taylor expansion approach was developed by the tifr group @xcite and the bielefeld group @xcite .",
    "results obtained by this method have been rather encouraging , as one has been able to study systematically i ) the finite volume effects to go towards a thermodynamical limit ( @xmath25 ) and ii ) the continuum limit of vanishing lattice spacing ( @xmath25 or equivalently @xmath26 ) .",
    "i will discuss some details of these results in the next section .",
    "expanding the partition function of eq .",
    "( 1 ) near @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the flavour index denoting up , down , strange .. quarks , one can evaluate the coefficients of the various terms by employing the usual simulation method since they are evaluated for @xmath27 for which the determinant is real .",
    "moreover , both the thermodynamic limit , @xmath29 , and the continuum limit , @xmath30 of these coefficients can be evaluated in the same way as the hadron spectrum can be computed in these limits to obtain the continuum results .",
    "we will consider below only two flavours , up and down , with the corresponding chemical potentials , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for simplicity .",
    "generalizing to any number of flavours is straightforward , although for our world two light and one moderately heavy flavour may suffice .    using standard definitions , number densities @xmath33 and",
    "the corresponding susceptibilities @xmath34 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( 1 ) as respectively the first and second derivatives of the partition function @xmath35 :    @xmath36    natural units with the boltzmann constant @xmath37 set to unity have been used above .",
    "while the @xmath33 are zero for @xmath38 , the susceptibilities are a nontrivial function of temperature .",
    "indeed , these are known to play many roles in the physics of finite temperature phase transition , including acting as independent indicators of the transition itself . denoting by @xmath39 higher derivatives of @xmath40 at the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) order with respect to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , the qcd pressure @xmath43",
    "is seen to have the following expansion in @xmath44 : @xmath45    at a generic point @xmath46 in the qcd phase diagram , one should be able to to sum the series for the pressure as a function of temperature @xmath0 . in presence of a critical point at @xmath47 , however , a finite radius of convergence in @xmath3 would limit the range up to which such a summation can be done .",
    "a typical lattice computation can thus aim to search for the qcd critical point by looking for the radius of convergence of the series at several temperatures .",
    "since the baryonic susceptibility should have a stronger power law divergence at the critical point , it was proposed @xcite to use that series instead of that of pressure above .",
    "it is easy to construct the series for baryonic susceptibility from the above expansion and look for its radius of convergence as the estimate of the nearest critical point .    due to the symmetry between baryons and antibaryons at @xmath48 , odd coefficients of the series",
    "vanish . using the even ones , successive estimates for the radius of convergence",
    "can be obtained by using the usual ratio method @xmath49 and the n@xmath50 root method @xmath51 of course , one needs to evaluate the @xmath52 limit of the radii estimates above to arrive at the true radius of convergence . due to the computational complexity involved , both the number of terms and cancellations amongst these terms increase as @xmath53 grows , terms up to 8th order in @xmath3 have been used so far @xcite . a proposal @xcite to alleviate these problems , and thus get more coefficients for the same computational resources has been made .",
    "it consists of adding the chemical potential simply as @xmath54@xcite , in contrast the commonly used form exponential in @xmath3 .",
    "the linearity in @xmath3 implies that most derivatives of the quark matrix with @xmath3 are zero except the first one .",
    "this reduces a lot the number of terms in each nonlinear susceptibility ( nls ) appearing in the equations above .",
    "one can show that it still leads to essentially the same results@xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see the results for the radius of convergence obtained by using it .    since the qcd critical point is expected to occur for real @xmath3 , a key point to note",
    "is that all the coefficients of the series must be positive .",
    "having made sure that it is so , one can then look for agreement between the two definitions above as well as their @xmath53-independence to locate the critical point .",
    "the detailed expressions for all the terms can be found in @xcite where the stochastic estimators method to evaluate them is also explained . for terms up to the 8@xmath50 order one",
    "needs 20 inversions of the dirac matrix , @xmath55 , on @xmath56 2000 vectors for a single measurement on a given gauge configuration .",
    "at least hundreds of such measurements are necessary to obtain the results discussed below ; more precise results will need even more .",
    "this makes the computation very time consuming .",
    "nevertheless , extension to 10th & even 12th order may be possible , using the idea in @xcite which may save up to 60 % computer time in these measurements .",
    "the results of ref .",

    "these have been investigated with no conclusive results .",
    "recognising that the higher moments of the same variables grow as a significantly higher power of @xmath91 , stephanov @xcite suggested fourth and higher moments to be a more attractive tool .    considering that the qcd critical point arises due to a variation in the baryon density ,",
    "such fluctuations in baryon number , given by the appropriate combinations of the many quark number susceptibilities discussed in the previous section , appear a more natural choice @xcite . in order to make predictions for the heavy ion experiments , and design further any search criteria for the critical point ,",
    "it was proposed @xcite to use the freeze - out curve as a a way to set the temperature @xmath0 and the chemical potential @xmath1 in the lattice qcd computations to compute the various fluctuations .",
    "the information hidden in the nonlinear susceptibilities discussed in the previous section can then be extracted by evaluating lattice qcd predictions along it .",
    "not only does such an approach amounts to assuming that the @xmath89 along the freeze - out curve do reflect the true thermodynamic variables of the system , but it also takes the model @xcite a step further and aims to predict the fluctuations in the hadron abundances from first principles . comparing these lattice predictions with data even at large @xmath88 , away from the critical point ,",
    "thus is tantamount to a non - perturbative test of qcd , subject to the assumptions outlined already .",
    "one expects the qcd critical point to have a critical region whose size depends on the size of the fireball as well as its critical exponents .",
    "the freeze - out curve may pass through it or may miss it . in the former case , one should expect the fluctuations to be enhanced in the experiments but nothing spectacular may happen in the latter case . if the conditions are right , it may even pass close enough to the critical point such that a study of fluctuations along it will detect its presence unambiguously . defining @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , and noting that the variance , skewness and kurtosis of the event distribution of baryon number measure the various @xmath95 s appearing in them , one sees that these ratios can be computed from lattice studies as well as from the experimental data .",

    "the source of the large errors at the critical point for @xmath79 could very well be the critical fluctuations themselves .",

    "other lattice qcd predictions , such as the equation of state or the transition temperature can be compared with experiments only indirectly by employing them in a hydrodynamical simulation and comparing the simulation results , e.g. , for the elliptic flow , with the corresponding experimental results . since initial conditions in such hydrodynamical simulations",

    "indeed , even if one were to be cautious in trusting the numerical precision of the present lattice results , what should be clear is that qualitatively such a non - monotonic behaviour is predicted by the existence of a qcd critical point ; the most relevant fact is that the @xmath98 s used to compute @xmath96 had a memory of the lattice result for the qcd critical point in the previous section . to that extent ,",
    "any model / theory with similar memory of a critical point would lead to a similar non - monotonic behaviour .",
    "moreover , if it is observed at even any other nearby location than those estimates , it would still signal the presence of qcd critical point , albeit somewhat shifted from the points in fig .",

    ", one needs to address the issue of neutral baryons ",
    "neutrons  which are not easy to detect and are thus missed .",

    "since the diverging correlation length at the critical point is linked to the @xmath109 mode which can not mix with any isospin modes , and the isospin susceptibility @xmath110 must be regular there .",
    "assuming protons , neutrons , pions to dominate , ref @xcite showed @xmath78 to be dominated by proton number fluctuations only .",
    "the star collaboration has exploited this idea and constructed the ratios @xmath108 and @xmath103 from net proton distributions @xcite in a specific rapidity range ( @xmath111 ) and a transverse momentum window ( 0.4 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath112 0.8 gev/@xmath114 ) .",

    "[ crpt1 ] , the results for @xmath108 do increase with the @xmath88 , as expected from the lattice results of fig .",

    "the star results for the 0 - 5% centrality for gold - gold collisions ( filled circles ) in the two lower panels show a good qualitative and to some extent quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions @xcite using the lattice methods .",
    "in particular , both show a flat behaviour at large @xmath88 and a dip at a lower value . for the lattice results",
    ", the dip appears due to the qcd critical point .",
    "whether it is so for the experimental data as well is a million dollar question .",

    "[ crpt1 ] . on the other hand",
    ", it seems to do a better job for the 70 - 80% centrality data .",
    "moreover , the analogue of @xmath108 ( the top and bottom panels ) also show deviations from the expected behaviour , as more vividly seen in the bottom panel of the figure . while these tantalizing results are clearly very exciting , and point towards a possible qcd critical point , more work is still needed on the theoretical and experimental fronts in form of improved precision as well as on dynamic model studies to pin the qcd connection more directly .    for small @xmath118 , one may invert the relations between @xmath96 s , or similar ratios , and _ determine _ in principle the freezeout parameters @xcite from the first principles lattice computations as well .",
    "alternatively , one may fit the experimental data to such ratios by varying the scale , the cross - over temperature @xmath63 , and _ determine _ it from the data @xcite directly . if the lattice computations were to be really precise , and came with a very reliable estimate of various systematic errors , any of the above approach to extract information would be equally valid , and could even afford a consistency check .",
    "what i outlined above in details , is perhaps the most conservative approach which aims to make a comparison of the lattice predictions with the data to discern an imprint of non - perturbative qcd in the experimental data at larger @xmath88 and the qcd critical point at the smaller ones .",
    "it needed an input scale @xmath119 - 175 mev , which appears as a normalization in fig .",
    "[ crpt ] , and was needed to relate the dimensionless ratios appearing in the lattice computations to the freeze - out parameters @xcite .",
    "recall that the lattice predictions @xcite in figs .",
    "[ m1m2m3 ] and [ prlst ] were based on the assumption that the freeze - out curve deduced from hadron abundances represents the true temperature and chemical potential of the fireball when the freeze - out occurs . even the attempt to determine the freeze - out parameters or the transition temperature @xmath63 from the experimental results by using precision lattice results can not escape from such an assumption .",
    "_ a  priori _ , there is no physical reason for this assumption to be true .",
    "indeed , we do not even have a theoretical proof that thermalization has to be achieved in the heavy ion collisions at all , let alone for the existence of a freeze - out curve . on the other hand , the data based extraction @xcite of the freeze - out curve is indeed very impressive and provides the best justification for it .",
    "the qcd phase diagram in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , fig . [ crpt ] , has begun to emerge using first principles lattice approach .",
    "lattice results for @xmath80 and 8 are first encouraging steps towards continuum limit , suggesting rather small cut - off effects .",
    "all lattice results so far suggest a critical point at a small @xmath120 1 - 2 .",
    "this maybe very encouraging for the beam energy scan program at rhic , bnl , which may be able to locate the critical point experimentally . ratios of nonlinear susceptibilities appear to be smooth on the freeze - out curve at large colliding energy . star results on proton number fluctuations in fig .",
