    "the only possibility we found to reproduce the double - peaked lc was to assume a distribution with most @xmath0ni  at low velocity , and a small amount at high velocity , as follows : ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) = ( 0.75 , 0.18 ) at @xmath36 km  s@xmath5 , ( 0.015 , 0.04 ) at @xmath37 km  s@xmath5 , ( 0.025 , 0.07 ) at @xmath38 km  s@xmath5 , and no @xmath0ni  at @xmath39 km  s@xmath5 . here",

    "thus optical photons are selectively produced in high density regions , where the optical opacity can be expected to be normal .",
    "because of the smaller average @xmath60 in the @xmath0ni  region and the enhanced escape of @xmath1-rays with respect to a model with normal @xmath60 , more @xmath0ni  is necessary to power the lc , but lower velocity @xmath0ni  ( i.e. , @xmath61 km  s@xmath5 ) can reproduce the first peak .",
    "in other words , @xmath0ni  is mixed out but does not reach the he layer at @xmath62 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "such a double - peaked distribution of @xmath0ni  might be produced by jets that did not reach the he layer .",
    "we computed synthetic spectra from the explosion models described above . the comparison with the observed spectra is necessary to distinguish among the models .",
    "we used the monte - carlo spectrum synthesis code described in mazzali & lucy ( 1993 ) , lucy ( 1999 ) , and mazzali ( 2000 ) .",
    "since the code does not take into account non - thermal processes , which are essential to populate levels @xcite , we introduced a `` non - thermal factor '' ( harkness et al .",
    "1987 ) to reproduce the he lines . this parameterized factor , denoted as @xmath63 , represents the degree of departure from the level populations computed using a modified nebular approximation , and is used to multiply all line opacities .",
    "our synthetic spectra are compared to the observed ones in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the bolometric luminosities used to fit the spectra agree with the observed ones within 10% .",
    "the model with ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) = ( 7 , 1.3 ) provides satisfactory fits for all spectra .",
    "the photospheric velocities this model predicts agree with those used to fit the spectra within 20% .    at the time of the first peak ( ut april 13 , 16 days after explosion ; modjaz et al .",
    "2005c ) sn  2005bf exhibited sn ic features , but actually both he and h can be distinguished .",
    "the feature near 5700  is probably 5876 .",
    "we obtained a good fit for this spectrum with a bolometric luminosity @xmath64 erg  s@xmath5  and a photospheric velocity @xmath65 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the non - thermal factor was set to 1",
    ". the model with @xmath31 fits better than that with @xmath66 .",
    "the feature at 6300  is reproduced as a blend of h@xmath28 and 6355  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , inset ) .",
    "the core of the line can not be due to because this would require a si velocity of @xmath67 km  s@xmath5 , which is smaller than the photospheric velocity .",
    "it can , however , be reproduced as h@xmath28 if @xmath68 of h is present above @xmath69 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "near maximum brightness ( ut may 4 , 37 days after explosion ) he lines become conspicuous .",
    "the model has @xmath70 erg  s@xmath5 , @xmath71 km  s@xmath5 , and @xmath72 ( only at @xmath73 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "most features , including , and are also well reproduced .",
    "the line near 6300  is reproduced as ( 6355 ) at this epoch : the photospheric velocity is low enough for si to be above the photosphere , while the h layer is too far above the photosphere to produce an absorption . for a spectrum on ut may 16th ( 49 days , kawabata et al .",
    "2005 ) , we also obtain a reasonable fit with parameters @xmath74 erg  s@xmath5 , @xmath75 km  s@xmath5 , and @xmath76 ( at @xmath77 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "these values of the `` non - thermal factor '' compare well with the results of detailed calculations ( lucy 1991 ) , although the value at the last epoch appears too large . to mimic the increasing velocity of @xmath78 5876",
    ", we introduced the non - thermal factor at increasingly high velocity at more advanced epochs .",
    "enhanced @xmath1-ray escape from the @xmath0ni - dominated region can yield rapidly increasing @xmath1-ray deposition in the he layer and higher he excitation , as confirmed by the fact that the @xmath1-ray deposition rates derived from the lc calculations increase gradually over time at 7,200 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the ratios between the deposition at 7,200 km  s@xmath5  49 days and 16 days after the explosion is 14.5 ( for comparison it is 4.6 at 6,200 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "as the optical depth of the he lines increases , the region where they become optically thick ( and where the non - thermal factor is applied ) moves to higher velocity .",
    "we have studied the properties of sn 2005bf by modelling the light curve and the spectra .",
    "our best fit model has @xmath79 and @xmath80 . the ejecta consist of @xmath0ni  ( @xmath81 ) , he ( @xmath82 ) , intermediate mass elements ( mainly o , si , s ) , and a small amount of h ( @xmath83 ) . thus the progenitor had lost almost all its h envelope , but retained most of the he - rich layer , as in wn stars .",
    "the double - peaked light curve is reproduced by a double - peaked @xmath0ni  distribution : such a distribution may be caused by jets that did not reach the he layer .",
    "strong he lines were not seen in the earliest spectra because radioactive @xmath0ni was too far from the he layer to excite he atoms .",
    "increasing @xmath1-ray deposition in the he layer due to enhanced @xmath1-ray escape from the @xmath0ni - dominated region may explain both the delayed strengthening and the increasing velocity of the he lines .",
    "the he core mass at explosion was @xmath84 .",
    "the progenitor was probably a wn star of main - sequence mass @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the formation of a wn star from a star of only @xmath86 suggests that rotation may have been important @xcite , although not sufficient to make sn 2005bf a hypernova .",
    "our model requires the production of an unusually large amount of @xmath0ni  but a normal explosion energy . to examine",
    "whether this is possible , we performed hydrodynamical simulations of explosive nucleosynthesis for the model with @xmath87 and @xmath88 as in @xcite . in order to produce @xmath89 @xmath0ni , the mass cut that separates the ejecta and",
    "the compact remnant should be as deep as @xmath90 . in the spherical model",
    "no fallback occurs .",
    "this suggests that the remnant was a neutron star rather than a black - hole .",
    "the mass range @xmath91 is near the transition from neutron star ( sn 2005bf ) to black hole formation ( sn 2002ap ; mazzali et al .",
    "2002 ) , the exact boundary depending on rotation and mass loss .",
    "interestingly , the progenitor of the cassiopeia a ( cas a ) sn remnant was also probably a wn star , and its nucleosynthetic features are consistent with a @xmath86 star ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . the compact remnant of cas a could be a magnetar ( a neutron star with strong magnetic fields , krause et al .",
    "the cas a remnant is extremely clumpy , with many knots .",
    "the fastest fe - rich jet moves with @xmath92 km s@xmath5 and is not mixed with n - he or o - rich layers @xcite .",
    "these properties resemble our model for sn 2005bf .",
    "we might speculate that sn 2005bf was similar to the explosion of cas a and that magnetorotational effects at collapse and later magnetar activity produced jets that created extremely clumpy ejecta in the @xmath0ni - rich layer .",
    "these jets were not energetic enough to reach the he layer .",
    "our best - fit model with enhanced @xmath1-ray escape predicts that the apparent bolometric magnitude of sn 2005bf as it emerges from behind the sun in late 2005 will be @xmath93 ( fig .",
