    "interacting magnetic nanostructured materials are currently the subject of intense research activity , driven by their fundamental interest and technological perspectives @xcite .",
    "numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been performed for various two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xcite arrangements of nanometer - size magnetic particles having different degrees of structural and magnetic disorder .",
    "the magnetic behaviour of these systems is determined by single - particle properties ( e.g. , particle moments , lattice and shape anisotropies , etc . ) , by the composition and morphology of the nanostructure , and in particular by the nature of the dominant interparticle interactions .",
    "the latter comprises especially the magnetic dipole coupling , which will be adressed in the present study .",
    "other interparticle interactions are , for example , the rudermann - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) indirect exchange mediated by the conduction electrons of a metallic substrate , or the short - range direct exchange in case when the particles are in contact .",
    "the relative importance of single - particle versus interparticle contributions can be tuned experimentally at least to some extent by changing sample characteristics such as the particle - size distribution or the average interparticle distance . for low particle coverages",
    "the interactions can be treated as a perturbation to the single - particle properties . however , for dense particle ensembles the interparticle interactions become increasingly important and eventually dominate . in this interesting case",
    "the single - particle approach is no longer applicable and an explicit treatment of the interactions is unavoidable @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question in this context is to identify and understand the collectively ordered magnetic states which are induced by the interactions in such particle ensembles .",
    "a few basic properties of strictly periodic dipole - coupled systems are summarized .",
    "the ground state of a _ square _ lattice of equal - sized ( monodispersed ) particles is the so - called _ microvortex _ ( mv ) magnetic arrangement @xcite .",
    "this magnetic structure is characterized by the microvortex angle @xmath1 , where the angles of the particle magnetizations of a plaquette of four neighbouring particles are given by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in particular , multiples of @xmath6",
    "represent _ columnar _ states , consisting of ferromagnetic rows or columns with alternating signs of magnetizations . evidently , the mv state has a vanishing net magnetization .",
    "the parallel or ferromagnetic ( fm ) state has a larger energy and is actually an unstable solution .",
    "the ordering of dipole - coupled spins is very sensitive to the lattice structure .",
    "for example , the honeycomb lattice has a ground state with a vanishing net magnetization which is similar to the mv state of the square lattice @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for the hexagonal lattice the ground state is ferromagnetic @xcite .    despite the fact that the dipole interaction is not rotationally invariant , the ground state of these dipole - coupled periodic particle arrays are",
    "continuously degenerate with respect to a rotation of the mv angle @xmath1 or of the fm angle @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this holds for classical spins at @xmath8 .",
    "thermal fluctuations , quantum fluctuations , or a structural disorder immediately lift these accidental ground state degeneracies of the periodic structures .",
    "the energy lowering associated to the symmetry breaking stabilizes the system in some particular magnetic order .",
    "therefore , the square and honeycomb lattices are said to show a so - called order - by - disorder effect @xcite .",
    "this implies that internal ( nontrivial ) degeneracies ( e.g. , the relative directions of magnetic sublattices ) are lifted by the presence of disorder , and that particular directions of the sublattice magnetizations are preferred .",
    "moreover , for a dipole - coupled square lattice the fluctuations induce a fourfold in - plane magnetic anisotropy . as shown by prakash and henley @xcite , the preferred in - plane magnetic orientations are the axial directions ( columnar states ) for thermal and quantum fluctuations , and the diagonal directions for a structural disorder induced by a small amount of vacancies .",
    "in addition , monte carlo calculations and interacting spin wave theory indicate that a magnetic ordering at finite temperatures exists for a dipole - coupled square spin lattice , since the magnetic excitations are not continuously degenerate @xcite .",
    "thus , the mermin - wagner theorem , which excludes an ordered state for a continuously degenerate 2d system at finite temperatures @xcite , is not effective in this case .",
    "notice that already the _ long - range _ character of the dipole interaction induces a collectively ordered magnetic state in a square lattice @xcite .    structural disorder , which is usually present in real magnetic nanostructures , results for example from the size and shape dispersion , positional disorder , or random anisotropy axes . due to the nonuniform and competing nature of the magnetic couplings the magnetic",
    "ordering in disordered particle ensembles is similar to the one of a spin - glass @xcite .",
    "thus , many different metastable states exist , which are characterized by strong magnetic noncollinearities .",
    "an intriguing question in this context is whether the dipole interaction in _ disordered _ planar particle ensembles results in a collectively ordered magnetic state .",
    "several experiments on interacting , high - density ferrofluid systems indicate the onset of a collectively ordered state below a characteristic , concentration - dependent temperature .",
    "for example , at this temperature a critical slowing down of the magnetic relaxation is observed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent measurements on co islands on cu(001 ) exhibit a magnetic hysteresis and remanence in the temperature range up to 150 k also for coverages below the magnetic percolation threshold @xcite . due to the small size of the co",
    "islands these findings could not explained simply by single - particle blocking effects .",
    "note that the experimental determination of the ordering temperature is difficult , since the relaxation times are often very long .",
    "hence , it is of considerable interest to analyze how the magnetic order depends on the sample parameters which can be controlled in experiment .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the theoretical study of the low - energy properties of dipole - coupled magnetic particle ensembles forming inhomogeneous planar arrangements with various degrees of disorder ranging from a quasi - periodic square lattice to a random array .",
    "numerical simulations are performed in order to achieve a detailed microscopic description within the model .",
    "the low symmetry of the system and the complicated nature of the interaction seem to preclude simple analytical approaches .",
    "we focus on the strongly interacting case , neglecting single - particle anisotropies .",
    "special attention is paid to the role of disorder and noncollinear arrangements of the particle magnetic moments . in particular , we determine the energy distribution of metastable states and the average magnetic dipole energy for different coverages and types of disorder .",
    "furthermore , we investigate global and local order parameters as function of disorder , and compare our results with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "all calculations are performed at @xmath8 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical methods are outlined in section [ sec : theo ] .",
    "representative results for the magnetic arrangements , as well as for various magnetic properties are presented in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "a conclusion is given in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "finally , in the appendix we report details for the extension of the dipole summation beyond the point - dipole approximation which takes into account effects resulting from the finite particle size .",
    "we consider a 2d rectangular unit cell in the @xmath9- plane with @xmath10 non - overlapping , disk - shaped magnetic particles . due to the strong direct exchange interaction and the small size of the particles under consideration",
    ", each particle @xmath11 can be viewed as a single magnetic domain ( stoner - wohlfarth particle ) @xcite .",
    "thus , a particle containing @xmath12 atoms carries a giant spin @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the atomic magnetic moment . for simplicity , we restrict the particle magnetizations to be confined to the @xmath9 plane , the planar rotator @xmath15 is then characterized by the in - plane angle @xmath16 : @xmath17 . in this study",
    "no size dispersion is considered , i.e. , @xmath18 . for disk - shaped particles",
    "the particle radius @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the interatomic distance .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the present results refer to a unit cell containing @xmath22 particles with @xmath23 atoms each .",
    "the size of the unit cell is given by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the average interparticle distance .",
    "for a planar array of circular particles the overall surface coverage is @xmath26 .",
    "four different types of the lateral particle arrangement have been considered : ( i ) a periodic square array , i.e. , the particle centers are located on the sites of a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath25 , ( ii ) a disturbed ( quasi - periodic ) array for which the particle centers deviate randomly from the square array , using a gaussian distribution @xmath27 with positional standard deviation @xmath28 , ( iii ) a diluted square particle lattice containing a number of vacancies @xmath29 with concentration @xmath30 , and ( iv ) a fully random distribution of non - overlapping particles within the unit cell .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are introduced in order to describe an infinitely extended planar particle ensemble . by considering a single unit cell a finite system",
    "can be realized as well . in this case",
    "the effect of boundaries will strongly dominate the resulting magnetic arrangement .    for such particle ensembles we consider the dipole - dipole interaction between the magnetic moments @xmath15 , which can also be expressed in terms of a dipole field @xmath31 acting on @xmath15 due to all other particle magnetic moments : @xmath32   = - \\frac{\\mu_0}{2}\\;\\sum_i\\ ; \\bi{m}_i\\;\\bi{b}_i^\\mathrm{dip }   \\ ; , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the distance between the centers of particles @xmath11 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 the vacuum permeability .",
    "the infinite range of the dipole interaction is taken into account by applying an ewald - type summation over all periodically arranged unit cells of the extended thin film @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual point - dipole sum we consider the leading correction resulting from the finite particle size ( dipole - quadrupole interaction ) , which is outlined in detail in the appendix . this correction becomes comparable to the point - dipole sum for large particle coverages or small interparticle distances .",
    "the energy unit of the dipole coupling is given by @xmath36 , with @xmath14 in units of the bohr magneton @xmath37 .",
    "in this study we assume values appropriate to fe ( @xmath38 , @xmath39   ) , which yields @xmath40  k. the effects of single - particle anisotropies resulting from the spin - orbit interaction , the dipole interaction among atomic magnetic moments within each particle ( shape anisotropy ) , external magnetic fields , and finite temperatures are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "starting from an arbitrary initial configuration @xmath41 of the magnetic directions , the total magnetic energy @xmath42 of the system is relaxed to the nearest local minimum , which often corresponds to a metastable state , by varying all in - plane angles @xmath16 of the particles using a conjugated gradient method @xcite .",
    "for example , the experimental situation of a remanent state after removal of an external magnetic field is simulated by choosing a fully aligned initial arrangement along a certain direction .",
    "we emphasize that the applied procedure is not intended to search preferently for the global energy minimum or ground state , which is the equilibrium state at @xmath8 .",
    "rather , at first we determine the energy distribution of the local minima for different degrees of structural disorder introduced in the planar particle array .",
    "a number of randomly chosen intital configurations @xmath41 is created and relaxed to a nearby local minimum .",
    "this metastable state is characterized by its energy @xmath42 and by its set of angles \\{@xmath16}. a twofold ( uniaxial ) symmetry is always present due to time inversion symmetry , i.e. , the energy of a state does not change under the transformation @xmath43 performed simultaneously for all particles .",
    "these mirrored states are considered to be equivalent .",
    "the numbers of trials yielding relaxed states with energies falling into given energy intervals are monitored , and the corresponding energy histogram is determined . since the minimization procedure relaxes typically to the local energy minimum that is closest to the initial state , this frequency provides a measure of the _ catchment area , _",
    "i.e. , the area of the energy valley belonging to that state in the high - dimensional configuration space .",
    "in order to account for the large number of local energy minima occurring in particle arrangements with structural inhomogeneities we determine the _ average dipole energy _",
    "@xmath0 resulting from many different trials for the same particle array .",
    "in addition , we average @xmath0 over a number of different realizations of the unit cell , using the same global variables which characterize the particle ensemble ( coverage , standard deviation @xmath28 , etc . ) . for comparison",
    ", @xmath0 is also calculated for the same spatial setup by assuming a ferromagnetic state ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) and averaging over the fm angle @xmath7 . in case of a disturbed ( quasi - periodic ) square lattice ,",
    "i.e. , if the particle numbering allows for the identification of a square plaquette of four neighbouring particles , we also determine the dipole energy for the microvortex magnetic arrangement , averaging over the mv angle @xmath1 .",
    "note that for a nonuniform particle ensemble these fm and mv magnetic arrangements do not correspond in general to local energy minima . for a _ random _ set of angles \\{@xmath16 } one obtains @xmath45 which constitutes the natural energy reference .",
    "the deviations of the metastable low - energy magnetic arrangements from the mv state are quantified by the _",
    "global _ and _ local microvortex order parameters _ @xmath46 and @xmath47 given by @xmath48^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\label{e1a } \\\\",
    "m_\\mathrm{mv}^\\mathrm{local}(\\sigma_r ) & = & \\frac{1}{4}\\bigg [ \\bigg (   \\sum_i^4(-1)^{i_y}\\cos\\phi_i\\bigg)^2+\\bigg(\\sum_i^4 ( -1)^{i_x}\\sin\\phi_i\\bigg)^2 \\bigg]^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\label{e1b } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the numbering of the rows and columns corresponding to particle @xmath11 . clearly , a reference square lattice is prerequisitive .",
    "hence , we restrict ourselves to a quasi - periodic array or to a square array with vacancies for which @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be uniquely defined .",
    "these two order parameters differ by the sum @xmath11 running either over all @xmath51 particles of the unit cell or over the four neighbouring particles within a square plaquette .",
    "they have a simple geometrical interpretation as the projection of the magnetic configuration on the two linear independent columnar states having @xmath52 and @xmath6 , regardless of all possible rotations of the mv states within this plane .",
    "@xmath46 measures the mv order in the nanostructure , whereas @xmath47 measures the short range ordering .",
    "both quantities are averaged over an appropriate number of initial configurations for the same particle arrangement and over different realizations of the unit cell .",
    "in addition @xmath47 is averaged over all four - particle plaquettes within the unit cell .    finally , another quantity characterizing the magnetic properties of nanostructured particle arrangements is the distribution of the microvortex angles @xmath1 .",
    "prakash and henley observed that the preferred mv angles for a square particle array with a small number of randomly distributed vacancies are the diagonal directions ( @xmath53 , etc . )",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate how the angular distribution of the microvortex angles depends on the type and degree of disorder . for this purpose",
    "different realizations of the nanostructure are created . for each particle setup the mv state with angle @xmath1 yielding the lowest energy is determined , and the corresponding frequencies for all angles are monitored .",
    "we consider a _ disturbed _",
    "square particle array with standard deviation @xmath28 , and a _ diluted _ square particle lattice with a concentration @xmath30 of vacancies .",
    "it should be noted that for a small number of vacancies one obtains an appreciable dependence on the shape of the unit cell ( aspect ratio of the rectangle ) , since these vacancies are located effectively on a square or rectangular lattice due to the periodic boundary conditions .    ,",
    "( b ) @xmath54 , and ( c ) @xmath55 , where @xmath25 refers to the average interparticle distance . the surface coverage amounts to @xmath56  % .",
    "the left columns refers to microvortex magnetic arrangements .",
    "relaxation of the magnetic moment directions using these arrangements as starting configurations yields the metastable solutions shown in the right columns .",
    ", width=491 ]",
    "first , figure  1 illustrates some representative low - energy magnetic arrangements of disordered particle arrays . with increasing disorder , characterized by the positional standard deviation @xmath28 , the magnetic configurations of the relaxed solutions become increasingly noncollinear .",
    "results are given for the magnetic states of a slightly disturbed ( @xmath57 ) , a moderately disturbed ( @xmath58 ) , and a strongly disturbed ( @xmath59 ) particle setup having all the same coverage @xmath56  % .",
    "both the optimal microvortex states and the relaxed solutions are shown .",
    "for @xmath57 the mv arrangement resembles quite closely the true solution , see figure  1(a ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  1(b ) , already a moderate amount of positional disorder destroys the mv state .",
    "this is physically reasonable since the mv order is tightly connected to the presence of a square - lattice symmetry of the particle ensemble .",
    "the degree of the mv ordering will be quantified below . for large @xmath28 or for a random particle setup",
    "the resulting magnetic arrangement is dominated by the formation of chains and loops of magnetic moments with a correlated ` head - to - tail ' alignment of the particle magnetizations , see figure  1(c ) @xcite .",
    "this reflects the tendency of the dipole interaction to favour a locally demagnetized state with a vanishing or small net magnetization .",
    "+    in figure  2 we present examples for the dipole energy distribution of metastable states of slightly and moderately disturbed particle setups shown in figures  1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "these were obtained by considering 20000 random initial configurations @xmath41 and by assigning the energies of the relaxed states to energy intervals @xmath60 $ ] , with @xmath61  k. distinctly different energy distributions are observed for weak and strong disorder . for weak disorder",
    "[ e.g. , @xmath57 , see figure  2(a ) ] an _ asymmetric _ energy distribution is found .",
    "the lowest energy state is reached very often , in fact about @xmath62  % of the trials relax to that ground state for @xmath63 , and about @xmath64  % for @xmath57 . moreover",
    ", the ground state configuration resembles closely the mv state with an almost vanishing net magnetization .",
    "in addition , numerous metastable states are obtained , which energies are distributed over a relatively broad range , and which are reached far less frequently . in other words , for weak disturbances the catchment area of the ground state is much larger than the ones of the higher - energy states .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energy differences between the few states with the lowest energies are quite larger than those found for less stable magnetic arrangements .",
    "since these latter states often exhibit a finite net magnetization , one expects that an external magnetic field tends to stabilize these higher - energy metastable configurations .     +    already for moderate disorder @xmath58 the character of the energy distribution changes strongly .",
    "an almost _ symmetric , _ gaussian - like energy distribution is obtained around the average dipole energy @xmath0 , see figure  2(b ) .",
    "the number of metastable states has increased remarkedly .",
    "in fact , out of the considered 20000 random trials no single state is reached twice after relaxation .",
    "this is in particular true for the low - energy states which are obtained with a very small frequency [ see the encircled region in figure  2(b ) ] . for an even stronger disorder",
    "the small peak in the frequency distribution for the low - energy states disappears completely .",
    "since the total number of metastable states increases strongly with increasing disorder , the corresponding catchment areas decreases dramatically .",
    "the obtained large number of metastable states is consistent with experiments on ferrofluids , which show that after application and removal of an external magnetic field the same magnetic arrangement is seldomly reached for a second time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from figure  2 one observes clearly that the average magnetic dipole energy @xmath0 decreases with increasing positional standard deviation @xmath28 . in figure  3",
    "we present results for @xmath65 per particle as function of @xmath28 and for different particle coverages @xmath66 .",
    "a square lattice corresponds to @xmath67 .",
    "results for random particle setups are also shown .",
    "@xmath68 is calculated for the relaxed solutions as well as for the ferromagnetic and microvortex magnetic states averaged over the corresponding in - plane angles @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "the obtained minimum values of @xmath68 are also displayed in order to illustrate the spread of the results around the average .",
    "whereas the energy distributions shown in figure  2 are determined from a _ single _ realization of the unit cell , here @xmath68 is in addition averaged over 20 different realizations .    in figure  3(a ) , @xmath68 is shown for a coverage @xmath56  % . with increasing @xmath28 the average dipole energy _ decreases , _",
    "i.e. , the respective magnetic binding energy _ increases _ with _ increasing disorder _ @xcite .",
    "for @xmath69 , @xmath68 approaches a constant value which corresponds , within the numerical dispersion of the data , to the average dipole energy for a _ random _ particle array .",
    "the decrease of the average energy is caused by the nonlinear dependence of the dipole interaction with respect to the interparticle distance @xcite .",
    "in fact , once disorder is introduced , the increase of @xmath0 for enlarged distances @xmath70 between some particle pairs is more than counterbalanced by a corresponding decrease for smaller distances between other pairs of particles .",
    "a similar behaviour is obtained for the ferromagnetic arrangement , albeit with a larger @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , for the mv state the average energy exhibits a minimum as function of @xmath28 at @xmath71 , and approaches @xmath45 with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "relaxation in a disordered particle arrangement , see figure  1 , is thus crucial to the disorder induced reduction of @xmath68 .",
    "let us recall that the fm and mv arrangements usually do not correspond to local energy minima for @xmath72 .    in figure  3(b )",
    "we show @xmath68 of the relaxed solutions and for different particle coverages @xmath66 .",
    "first of all one observes that the overall dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath28 is not significantly affected by @xmath66 .",
    "increasing the interparticle spacing @xmath25 decreases the magnitude of the average dipole energy , which should scale in principle as @xmath73 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath66 is depicted in figure  3(c ) for the relaxed solutions .",
    "indeed , the expected behaviour @xmath74 is obtained for weak positional disorder @xmath28 .",
    "however , for strong disorder and for small coverages a different concentration dependence is observed .",
    "it seems that the strong magnetic noncollinearities of the magnetic configurations render the simple scaling expectation no longer applicable",
    ". it would be therefore interesting to investigate in detail the energy scaling as function of coverage @xmath66 especially in the limit of strongly disturbed arrays of magnetic particles .",
    "note that the magnitude of the dipole energy is comparably small .",
    "this is a consequence of the disk - shaped particles assumed in our calculations . for compact sphere - shaped particles with the same radius @xmath19 as the disk - shaped ones , thus yielding the same surface coverage @xmath66 , the corresponding dipole energy will be significantly enhanced due to the larger number of atoms @xmath75 per spherical particle .",
    "moreover , similar as the positional disorder a particle - size dispersion yields noncollinear magnetic arrangements even if the particle centers form a periodic lattice",
    ". however , one observes that @xmath0 does not vary strongly with increasing size dispersion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the crossover from a quasi - periodic to a random particle ensemble . in figure  4",
    "we show the coverage dependence of the positional standard deviation @xmath76 , above which the average energy @xmath68 of a quasi - periodic particle arrangement reaches the limiting value of a random setup .",
    "one observes that @xmath76 decreases with increasing coverage @xmath66 , as can qualitatively explained by the following simple scaling consideration .",
    "the particles are scattered within a certain distance around the sites of the square lattice , the average scattering radius @xmath77 can be estimated by @xmath78 . for a given coverage @xmath66 the average dipole energy for a random particle setup is approximately reached for the _ crossover standard deviation _",
    "@xmath76 for which @xmath77 plus the particle radius equals half of the average interparticle distance , @xmath79 using @xmath26 , one obtains @xmath80 in figure  4 , @xmath81 is compared with the inflection points of @xmath68 extracted from figure  3(b ) for various coverages @xmath66 .",
    "one observes that except for the largest considered coverage @xmath56  % a satisfactory agreement is obtained , which supports the validity of the previous scaling considerations .",
    "+    results for the global and local microvortex order parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are presented in figure  5 , assuming two different types of disorder . in figure  5(a ) we consider a disturbed square particle lattice as function of the positional standard deviation @xmath28 for a coverage @xmath56  % , and in figure  5(b ) we vary the concentration of vacancies in an otherwise periodic array .",
    "the rather large dispersions of the mv order parameters result from many different initial arrangements and different realizations of the unit cell .",
    "locally the mv order is preserved even for strong disorder .",
    "for example , for @xmath55 which refers to an almost random particle array , see figure  3(a ) , we obtain @xmath82 , and @xmath83 for @xmath84  % .",
    "in contrast , positional disorder has a much stronger effect on @xmath85 .",
    "especially positional disturbances quickly destroy the long - range mv ordering in the square lattice .",
    "for instance , for a particle coverage @xmath56  % this occurs already for @xmath86 , which is consistent with the minimum of @xmath68 of the mv state , see figure  3(a ) .",
    "+   +    finally , we present results for the angular distribution of the microvortex angle @xmath1 for different degrees of disorder .",
    "we consider first the effect of _ vacancies _ in an otherwise periodic square particle lattice , as has been done previously by prakash and henley @xcite . according to these authors the preferred mv angles for a dipole - coupled square spin lattice with a small amount of vacancies",
    "correspond to the diagonal directions .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from figure  6 , a strong frequency of the diagonal mv angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 is obtained for low vacancy concentrations @xmath30 .",
    "the frequencies of these states decrease with increasing @xmath30 , and vanish for @xmath89  -  7  % .",
    "in addition to the diagonal states we also obtain a strong frequency of the mv angle along the axial directions ( columnar states ) with mv angles @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these states are also present for larger vacancy concentrations .",
    "we have investigated whether the angular distributions are affected by the finite size of the unit cell , in particular whether this could induce the pronounced frequencies of the columnar states .",
    "if this is true , the ratio of the frequencies of @xmath52 and @xmath6 is affected by a variation of the aspect ratio of the rectangular unit cell .",
    "we found that for not too small @xmath30 the dependence of the calculated frequencies for columnar and diagonal states as function of size and shape of the unit cell is quite weak .",
    "hence , our results indicate that the presence of a few vacancies induces a more complicated angular distribution of the mv angle . in any case",
    ", we would like to point out that at present we can not rule out completely the possibility that the pronounced frequencies of the columnar states might be caused by the finite size of the unit cell .",
    "concerning other types of disorder , we observe that for a _ disturbed _ square lattice characterized by the positional standard deviation @xmath28 there is no particular preference of the diagonal states .",
    "for this type of disorder only the columnar states exhibit a pronounced frequency as compared to the rest of the mv angles .",
    "the frequency peaks for columnar states decrease for increasing disorder and vanish above @xmath92 for the particle coverage @xmath56  % . a marked dependence of the angular distribution on the size and shape of the unit cell",
    "is not observed also for this type of disorder . to conclude this discussion , we would like to emphasize that the angular distributions presented in figure  6 were all obtained for a _ nonrelaxed _ mv state .",
    "we have also performed corresponding calculations for the _ relaxed _ solutions , and have determined the mv states which are closest to the noncollinear relaxed magnetic arrangements . in contrast to the results shown in figure  6 the corresponding angular histograms for the relaxed states exhibit a strong dependence on the size and shape of the unit cell .",
    "therefore , further investigations would be necessary in order to clarify this matter .",
    "in the present study we have investigated the low - energy properties of disordered planar arrays of magnetic nanoparticles interacting by the dipole coupling .",
    "different kinds of disorder have been considered .",
    "already small deviations from a square particle lattice lift the continuous degeneracy of the microvortex ground state .",
    "a strongly noncollinear magnetic order appears in the nanostructure which destroys the mv arrangement , as can be seen from the corresponding order parameter .",
    "we have shown that with an increasing disorder the energy distribution of the metastable states changes qualitatively .",
    "our results indicate that it should be very difficult to identify the ground state energy and its magnetic configuration for strongly inhomogeneous particle arrangements .",
    "this behaviour is typical for spin - glass systems or random magnets .",
    "a detailed investigation of the spin - glass hehaviour of the nanostructure is certainly worthlike .",
    "this would require the consideration of additional properties such as the nonlinear susceptibility and the time dependent correlation functions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the average magnetic dipole energy of an ensemble of magnetic particles decreases with increasing positional disorder . moreover",
    ", the average dipole energy @xmath0 of a quasi - periodic particle arrangement resembles the one of a random particle setup above the coverage - dependent crossover standard deviation @xmath81 .",
    "a simple scaling behaviour of @xmath81 has been derived , which reproduces quite accurately the coverage dependence of @xmath81 .",
    "structural disorder and strong magnetic noncollinearity effects result in a deviation from the straightforward scaling @xmath74 of the average dipole energy as function of the coverage .    for a square particle lattice with a small vacancy concentration we found a preferred orientation of the microvortex angle @xmath1 along the diagonal directions .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained previously by prakash and henley @xcite .",
