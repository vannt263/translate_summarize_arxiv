    "our simulation is split into two stages . the early evolution ( @xmath1s )",
    "is computed with the herakles code ( plewa & mller , in preparation ) which solves the multidimensional hydrodynamic equations using the direct eulerian version of the piecewise parabolic method @xcite and which incorporates the physics ( equation of state , neutrino source terms and light bulb ) described in the simulations of neutrino driven supernovae by @xcite with the following modifications .",
    "general relativistic corrections are added to the gravitational potential .",
    "a 14-isotope network is implemented to compute the explosive nucleosynthesis including the 13 @xmath2-nuclei from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and a tracer nucleus which is used to keep track of the neutronization of the material .",
    "the 2d spherical grid consists of 400 radial zones ( @xmath5 cm ) and 192 angular zones ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the initial data is a 15@xmath7 progenitor model @xcite which has been collapsed @xcite .",
    "the following set of neutrino parameters is adopted ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath8 . the neutrino spectra and the functional form of the luminosity decay are the same as in @xcite .",
    "a random initial seed perturbation is added to the velocity field with a modulus of @xmath9 of the ( radial ) velocity of the post  collapse model .",
    "the computation begins 20ms after core bounce and is carried up to 800ms when the explosion energy has saturated at @xmath10erg .",
    "the subsequent propagation of the shock through the stellar envelope and the growth of rt instabilities is simulated with the adaptive mesh refinement code amra ( plewa & mller , in preparation ) .",
    "neutrino physics is not included in amra because it does influence the explosion dynamics only within the first few seconds .",
    "newtonian self - gravity is taken into account by solving poisson s equation in one spatial dimension with an angular average of the density , which is an adequate approximation once the shock has left the iron core .",
    "the equation of state includes contributions from photons , non - degenerate electrons , @xmath11-pairs , @xmath12 , and the nuclei included in the reaction network .",
    "the amr calculations are started with the inner and outer boundaries located at @xmath13 cm and @xmath14 cm .",
    "no further seed perturbations are added .",
    "the maximum resolution is equivalent to that of a uniform grid of @xmath15 zones .",
    "the radial extent of the base grid is extented whenever the supernova shock approaches the outer grid boundary , which attains a maximum value of @xmath16 cm at @xmath17s . reflecting ( outflow )",
    "boundary conditions are imposed in angular ( radial ) direction .",
    "the initial data for the amr simulation consists of three different parts . interior to 17000 km ( @xmath18 ) data from the simulations of the first stage of the explosion , and exterior to that radius data from bruenn s 1d post - collapse model are used .",
    "matched to bruenn s model ( covering only parts of the he core ) is a new progenitor model of woosley ( private communication ; data for the 1988 model are no longer available ) .",
    "the simulation of the early evolution shows , in accordance with @xcite , that neutrino driven convection leads to the formation of a roughly spherical but very inhomogeneous post  shock shell containing dense @xmath4rich regions and low  density , deleptonized bubbles .",
    "these inhomogeneities provide the seed for rt mixing in the stellar envelope at the si / o and ( c+o)/he interfaces of the sn1987a progenitor model within only about a minute after core bounce @xcite .",
    "the stellar metal core is completely shredded only 5minutes after bounce and high velocity clumps of newly synthesized elements are observed to be ejected up to the outer edge of the he  core . while the instability is turning the inner core of the star inside out , a dense shell forms at the he / h interface as a result of the deceleration of the main shock in the h",
    " envelope .",
    "the subsequent interaction of the metal  enriched clumps with this dense he  shell leads to their strong deceleration . after entering the shell",
    "the clumps reach transonic speeds and dissipate a large fraction of their kinetic energy . as a result the entire dense shell and the h  envelope",
    "are pervaded by bow - shocks and strong acoustic waves from 3000 to 10000s after core bounce . during this interaction , which has not been reported in any previous calculation of rt instabilities in sneii progenitors , the composition within the clumps themselves is almost entirely homogenized .",
    "furthermore , acting like a wall the shell shields the h  envelope of the star from becoming enriched with freshly synthesized elements .    according to a linear stability analysis",
    "the he / h interface should be rt unstable .",
    "however , we do not find a strong growth of the instability at this interface .",
    "since the supernova shock is almost perfectly spherically symmetric when it emerges from the he  core the evolution in these layers proceeds basically one - dimensional . only when the metal ",
    "enriched clumps reach the inner boundary of the dense shell behind the he / h interface and start to dissipate their energy about 3000s after bounce , are perturbations from spherical symmetry induced by the waves which are thereby excited . however , as the interface is only moderately unstable at this time , only small scale variations are observed .",
    "if this result also holds for other progenitor models , it indicates that neutrino driven convection alone is not able to provide the perturbations which are needed to induce strong mixing of the helium core and the h  envelope as observed in sn1987a .    already within the first 300s of the explosion elements like @xmath19 and @xmath20 that made up the original metal core as well as the newly synthesized @xmath4",
    "have been mixed almost homogeneously throughout the inner @xmath21 , _ i.e.,_throughout about the inner half of the he  core .",
    "the extent of mixing increases up to @xmath22 at 10000s .",
    "species which are not mixed this far out in mass are @xmath23 and our neutronization tracer .",
    "these nuclei were synthesized in the innermost layers of the ejecta which were located very close to the collapsed core .",
    "the dynamics of the explosion is reflected in the distribution of the mass of @xmath4 in velocity space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nivel ] ) .",
    "the most conspicuous feature which can be seen in this plot is the bulk deceleration of the material from velocities as large as @xmath24km / s at a time of 50s after bounce to less than 1500km / s after 10000s . at 50s",
    "the average @xmath4 velocity is @xmath25km / s with a spread of about @xmath26km / s . at 10000s",
    "the corresponding values are @xmath27km / s and @xmath28km / s .",
    "the maximum velocities are significantly smaller than the ones which have been observed in sn1987a . during no phase of the evolution",
    "we do see an acceleration of material from the former metal core of the star .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of herant & benz ( 1992 ) who report to have obtained nickel velocities comparable to those observed in sn1987a provided that they premixed the @xmath4 in their sph calculations throughout 75% ( in mass ) of the metal core ( @xmath29 ) of their @xmath30 progenitor .",
    "the occurrence of conditions which could give rise to the development of an instability at the he / h interface is harmful for the propagation of the clumps .",
    "even if very strong perturbations are imposed upon the dense unstable shell which forms at this interface the instability is growing too slowly in order to shred this `` wall '' before the clumps will reach it . on the other hand , with a smoother density profile between the he  core and the h ",
    "envelope , the dense shell might either not form at all or become at least less pronounced which might help the clumps to preserve most of their energy .",
    "such a smoother density profile could be envisaged when the progenitor star of sn1987a was not the result of the evolution of a single star but a merger of two smaller stars @xcite .",
    "the dimensionality of our simulations may also be a possible cause of the problem .",
    "the fingers found in 2d calculations are in fact axially symmetric tori which also experience a larger drag when propagating outwards than genuinely 3d mushroom structures .",
    "finally , `` missing physics '' in the explosion models itself might be responsible for the small maximum nickel velocities that we obtain .",
    "effects like rotation or anisotropic neutrino emission might have to be considered for the explosion mechanism .",
    "these may result in an additional large scale asphericity of the shock or even in jet - like outflows of the ejecta . in that case",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that it is possible to reproduce nickel velocities in excess of 3000km / s .",
    "however , these simulations suffer from coarse resolution and from rather unrealistic parameterized initial conditions .",
    "our calculations prove for the first time that convective instabilities which develop during the first second of the explosion are able to provide the seed for significant rt mixing at the si / o and ( c+o)/he interfaces .",
    "this might offer an explanation for the mixing observed in the explosions of sneib / ic @xcite .    during the first @xmath31 minutes of the explosion our @xmath4 velocities are as high as those measured in the typeii sn1987a and the typeiib sn1993j .",
    "the main reason for this agreement is the subsonic ballistic motion of the clumps relative to the mean background flow .",
    "the concordance with observations is , however , destroyed , when the clumps enter the outer helium core and encounter a dense ( rt unstable ) shell which is left behind by the shock at the he / h interface .",
    "the clumps are decelerated to velocities @xmath32km / s because their propagation in this new environment is transonic .",
    "hence , the main difficulty for future simulations is how to avoid to decelerate the initially fast @xmath4 clumps ."
