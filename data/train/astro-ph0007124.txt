    "analysis of the motion of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars and of related groups of young stars provide essential tests of star formation models .",
    "different space velocities and velocity gradients of the stellar associations can be derived from the major star formation scenarios , like sequential star formation , star formation by high - velocity clouds , gould s belt models , etc .",
    "proper motion measurements of the members of these associations provide one way to discriminate among these predictions .",
    "the pms stars are supposed to be sufficiently young to be very close to their birthplaces and to have velocities still very similar to the initial ones , so that one can get clear constraints on the birth mechanism .    in this work ,",
    "we investigated the pms stars of an extended region of aligned molecular clouds and ob associations that includes the chamaeleon , lupus , upper scorpius - ophiuchus and corona australis regions .",
    "this selected area is specially interesting because the associations are close enough to the sun ( 100 - 150 pc ) , so that a refined kinematical study can be made .    the hipparcos mission ( esa 1997 ) provided accurate measurements of positions , parallaxes and proper motions , for ob stars brighter than v=10 mag , allowing to study the kinematics of the same regions ( de zeeuw et al .",

    "zooms of the 4 main star - forming regions studied in this work . in all these regions , a dominant orientation of the proper motions towards smaller longitudes can be observed .",
    "this is in large part the effect of the reflex solar motion , as can be seen in the @xmath50 versus @xmath51 graphs of the same regions ( figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ]  lower panels ) .",
    "since the effect of solar motion on the star proper motion depends on the distance of the stars , and the distances of pms stars are usually poorly known , we present in these figures the reflex solar motion as a function of distance , from 50 to 200 pc .",
    "we assumed the basic solar motion , with components u = 9 km / s ( directed towards the galactic center ) , v = 11 km / s , w = 6 km / s .",
    "the reflex solar motion depends also on the direction of the stars , and since some of the regions studied here have sizes of several degrees , we present it for two extreme directions in each field ( except for corona australis , which is a small field ) .    in all groups , a number of stars are found to have proper motions that lie well outside the average distribution .",
    "notice that some of these stars that can be seen in the ( @xmath52 ) maps ( for upper sco , chamaeleon and corona australis ) are absent from the ( @xmath53 ) graphs , due to the scale that we adopted .",
    "we consider that these stars have a large probability of being recently formed runaway stars and a possible explanation for them is the disruption of multiple systems .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility of errors , like a wrong identification during the proper motion determination process ; however , note that some of the stars with anomalous proper motions are bright and were found in several sources ( eg .",
    "hd 137727 , hd 140637 ) , which reduces the probability of an erroneous identification .    disregarding the runaway stars , the groups of pms stars present proper motion dispersions of the order of 10 mas / yr typically .",
    "this means that in a period of about one million years , the stars would move apart several degrees in the sky , and would look very dispersed .",
    "we must bear in mind , however , that part of this apparent dispersion may not be intrinsic , but due to the fact that the sun is approaching the group .",
    "for instance , most of the pms stars of upper scorpius present negative radial velocities , while most of the stars in chamaeleon present positive radial ones ( e.g. gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "@xcite ; torres et al .",
    "@xcite ; covino et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us now comment on the average proper motion of the stellar groups .",
    "we already noticed that the average values are largely explained by the reflex solar motion .",
    "however , they are not entirely due to this effect or , in other words , intrinsic average proper motion of the groups are detected .",
    "for instance , in the case of lupus ( our largest sample , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , the center of mass of the points in the ( @xmath54 ) graph is about ( @xmath2230,@xmath229 ) , which suggests mean distance of about 85 pc , if we consider only the reflex solar motion .",
    "however , the average distance of 14 stars of this group that have parallaxes from hipparcos is 138 pc .",
    "this suggests that the lupus pms stars have a mean intrinsic proper motion in the longitude direction of about @xmath55 = @xmath2210 mas / yr .    the chamaeleon group is peculiar , in that it seems to present two distinct kinematic groups , even after excluding the runaway stars .",
    "a group with proper motions close to about @xmath55 = @xmath2240 mas / yr , @xmath50 = @xmath2215 mas / yr , seems to be well behaved .",
    "its observed proper motion could be explained by the the reflex solar motion , if its distance is of the order of 70 pc . and indeed , some of the stars of this group have distances determined by hipparcos , and are not too different from this value ( t cha , 66 pc , rx j1158.5 - 7754a , 86 pc , rx j1159.7 - 7601 , 92 pc , hd 104237 , 116 pc ) .",
    "this group was already discussed by terranegra et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; notice , however , that bertout et al .",
    "( @xcite ) consider that the hipparcos distance of t cha is incorrect .",
    "another group of stars presents positive values of @xmath50 , considerably different from the reflex solar motion . among these",
    ", only hd97300 has parallax measured by hipparcos ( 187 pc ) .",
    "finally , we remark that in the studied regions , no systematic differences between the proper motions of t tauri stars and haebe stars can be observed .",
    "our results favour the pms nature of the candidates haebe stars included in our list .    a deeper analysis of the proper motion of the groups of pms stars , in connection with the ages of the subgroups ,",
    "will be presented in a separate paper , where our results are compared with the models proposed in the literature for the mechanisms that might have triggered the star formation .",

    "<S> we present proper motion measurements of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars associated with major star - forming regions of the southern hemisphere ( chamaeleon , lupus , upper scorpius - ophiuchus , corona australis ) , situated in the galactic longitude range @xmath0 to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a list of pms stars as complete as possible was established based on the herbig and bell catalogue and many new catalogues like the pds survey , the catalogue of herbig ae / be stars by th et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xcite ) , x - rays surveys , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements made use of public material ( mainly ac2000 and usno  </S>",
    "<S> a2.0 catalogues ) as well as scans of serc  j schmidt plates with the mama measuring machine ( paris ) and valinhos ccd meridian circle observations ( brazil ) . </S>",
    "<S> we derived proper motions for 213 stars , with an accuracy of 5 to 10 mas / yr depending mainly on the difference of epochs between the position sources . the main characteristics of the sample are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that systematic motions of groups of stars exist , which are not explained by the reflex solar motion . </S>"
