    "milgrom  ( 1983 ) proposed that the kinematics of galaxies might be explained without dark matter if one allows for a modification of newtonian dynamics in the low - acceleration regime . in bekenstein & milgrom s ( 1984 )",
    "formulation of milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) poisson s equation @xmath1 is replaced by the non - relativistic field equation @xmath2 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqmond}\\ ] ] with boundary conditions @xmath3 as @xmath4 for a system of finite mass . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the newtonian and mond gravitational potentials produced by the density distribution @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the standard euclidean norm .",
    "the interpolating function @xmath9 runs smoothly from @xmath10 at @xmath11 to @xmath12 at @xmath13 , with the transition taking place at @xmath14 , i.e. , when @xmath15 is of order the characteristic acceleration @xmath16 . from poisson s equation and equation  ( [ eqmond ] )",
    "it follows that the mond gravitational field @xmath17 is related to the newtonian field @xmath18 by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a solenoidal field dependent on the specific @xmath7 considered . unless the system has special symmetries , @xmath22 ( bekenstein & milgrom  1984 ; brada & milgrom  1995 ) .    due to the non - linearity of mond ,",
    "the problem of calculating the gravitational field produced by a distribution of @xmath0 particles is harder in mond than in newtonian dynamics . in mond",
    "there is not an analytic expression for the force between two particles , so to study the two - body problem one must solve equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) with source term given by the two particles ( milgrom  1986 ) .",
    "similarly , when computing the mond gravitational potential of a distribution of @xmath0 particles , one can not use methods that exploit the linearity of poisson s equation . thus , direct summation or hierarchical ( barnes & hut 1986 ) poisson solvers can not be used in mond @xmath0-body codes .",
    "as the solenoidal field @xmath21 is typically relatively small for equilibrium configurations ( brada & milgrom  1995 ; ciotti  2006 ) , one could be tempted to run @xmath0-body simulations assuming @xmath23 . but neglecting @xmath21 when simulating time - dependent dynamical processes has dramatic effects such as non - conservation of total linear momentum , as first pointed out by felten  ( 1984 ; see also nipoti  2007a ) . instead , equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) must be solved at each time step . for collisionless systems",
    "a natural choice is to consider particle - mesh @xmath0-body codes based on a mond poisson solver .",
    "we developed n - mody , a parallel three - dimensional particle - mesh code for collisionless @xmath0-body simulations in mond .",
    "the @xmath0-body code and the potential solver on which the code is based are described in detail in londrillo & nipoti ( 2008 ) , and have been tested and applied in ciotti  ( 2006 , 2007 ) and nipoti  ( 2007a , 2007b , 2007c , 2008 ) .",
    "the potential solver of n - mody solves the mond field equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) using a relaxation method in spherical coordinates based on spherical harmonics expansion .",
    "thus the code is ideally suited for simulations of isolated stellar systems ( but can be adapted to run simulations of interacting galaxies ; see nipoti  2007c ) .",
    "n - mody is one of the very few mond @xmath0-body codes developed so far : as far as we know the only other three - dimensional mond @xmath0-body code for simulation of collisionless stellar systems is brada & milgrom s  ( 1999 ) code , which is based on a multi - grid potential solver in cartesian coordinates and has been implemented also by tiret & combes  ( 2007 ) .",
    "recently , a code for mond cosmological @xmath0-body simulations has been developed by llinares  ( 2008 ) .",
    "we have applied n - mody to study a few relevant stellar dynamical processes , such as collisionless collapse , galaxy merging and dynamical friction .    our simulations of collisionless collapses ( nipoti  2007a ) showed that the phase - mixing and violent - relaxation timescales are significantly longer in mond than in newtonian gravity ( see also ciotti  2007 ) . remarkably , when mond systems eventually reach equilibrium , they have projected surface mass density and velocity profiles consistent with observations of elliptical galaxies . however , we found that the collapse end - products can not satisfy simultaneously the observed faber & jackson ( 1976 ) , kormendy ( 1977 ) and fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis  1987 , dressler  1987 ) relations of elliptical galaxies , under the assumption of luminosity - independent stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "our results on phase mixing and violent relaxation in mond suggested that galaxy merging could be less effective in mond than in newtonian gravity , also because in mond galaxies are expected to collide at high speed , and there are no dark matter halos to absorb orbital energy and angular momentum ( binney  2004 ; sellwood  2004 ) .",
    "our mond simulations of collisionless merging confirmed that the merging timescales are significantly longer in mond than in newtonian gravity with dark matter , suggesting that observational evidence of rapid merging could be difficult to explain in mond ( nipoti  2007c ) .",
    "finally , we applied n - mody to study dynamical friction in mond ( nipoti  2008 ) .",
    "our simulations showed that the dynamical friction timescale is significantly shorter in mond systems than in newtonian systems _ with the same phase - space distribution of baryons and additional dark matter _ , confirming the analytic estimate of ciotti & binney  ( 2004 ) .",
    "in nipoti  ( 2008 ) we explored the case of the evolution a rigid massive bar rotating at the centre of a much more massive stellar system , but our results are expected to apply also to the case of a small satellite orbiting within a stellar system , such as a globular cluster in a galaxy . as a consequence , in the context of mond it is difficult to explain that the globular clusters of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy fornax have not sunk yet to the galaxy centre ( see also ciotti & binney  2004 and snchez - salcedo  2006 ) .",
    "the results of our @xmath0-body simulations show that mond systems evolve dynamically very differently from equivalent newtonian systems with dark matter . in particular , phase mixing , violent relaxation and galaxy merging are less effective , while dynamical friction is more effective in mond than in newtonian gravity with dark matter .",
    "it might seem counterintuitive that in mond galaxy merging timescales are long , while dynamical friction timescales are short .",
    "however , galaxy merging can not be described purely in terms of dynamical friction . the orbital energy and angular momentum are absorbed mainly by dark matter halos in the case of newtonian merging , while by the outer parts of the baryonic distributions in mond merging .",
    "thus , in the newtonian case there is plenty of particles able to store the orbital energy of the systems , and the concept of dynamical friction does apply , while in the mond case the particles responsible for the absorption are relatively few , and dynamical friction does not play a central role ( nipoti  2008 ) .",
    "similar considerations apply to the case of a bar rotating at the centre of a mond galaxy . for the concept of dynamical friction to apply",
    "the bar must rotate in a much more massive stellar system .",
    "this is typically the case in newtonian systems , because of the presence of dark matter halos , but not necessarily in mond : _ if the bar mass is a substantial fraction of the galactic baryonic mass _ it might well be that the slowing - down is slower in mond than in an equivalent newtonian system with dark matter ( as actually found by tiret & combes  2007 ) .",
    "these examples show how a careful comparison between equivalent systems is fundamental to draw conclusions about dynamical processes in different gravity theories .",
    "this kind of comparison was the aim of our @xmath0-body simulations , which actually showed that mond systems and newtonian systems with dark matter can be distinguished studying their time evolution .",
    "the main result of our experiments is that some phenomena , such as rapid dissipationless galaxy mergers or the survival of globular clusters in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , appear difficult to explain in the context of mond .",
