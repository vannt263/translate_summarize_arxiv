    "the remaining 110256 sources with @xmath7 are the robust extragalactic 6dfgs redshifts that should be used ( alongside the 14815 literature redshifts ) in any analysis or other application .",
    "tables  [ tab : distribution ] and [ tab : breakdown ] give the breakdown of these numbers across various 6dfgs sub - samples .",
    "redshift uncertainties and blunder rates were estimated from the sample of 6dfgs galaxies with repeat redshift measurements . there were 8028 such redshift pairs , 43percent of which were first - year ( pre-2002.5 ) data .",
    "most repeat measurements were made because of a low - quality initial measurement , or because of a change in the field tiling strategy after the first year of observations .",
    "we define a blunder as a redshift mismatch of more than 330 ( @xmath13 ) between a pair of redshift measurements that we would expect to agree .",
    "the blunder rate on individual 6dfgs redshifts is 1.6percent , the same as reported for the first data release @xcite . in late 2002 , a new transmissive volume - phase holographic ( vph ) gratings ( 580v and 425r ) replaced the existing reflection gratings ( 600v and 316r ) , resulting in improved throughput , uniformity , and data quality . excluding first - year repeats reduces the individual blunder rate to 1.2percent .",
    "while the first - year data represent nearly half of all repeat measurements , they represent less than a fifth of the overall survey .",

    "@xmath64 are likely cross - talk pairs which are usually confirmed through visual inspection of the spectra .",
    "cross - talk is an uncommon occurrence ( about @xmath65 percent of all spectra ) , and it only affects the redshifts for spectra with fewer real features than false ones . an algorithm was used to search for coincident emission lines in adjacent spectra and a cross - talk severity value assigned from 1 to 5 .",
    "users are urged to exercise caution with spectra and redshifts having cross - talk values of 3 or greater .",
    "a detailed discussion of the cross - talk phenomenon can be found in the database documentation on the website .",
    "6 .   * highest redshift sources : *  very occasionally , spurious features due to cross - talk or poor sky - subtraction led to erroneously high redshifts .",
    "this is particularly the case with the additional target samples ( @xmath66 ) , whose selection criteria do not necessarily ensure reliable detections at the optical wavelengths of 6dfgs spectra .",
    "special care should be taken with the high redshift sources reported for these targets .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . 7 .",
    "* orphan fields : *  the final data release includes ( for the first time ) data from 29 orphan fields .",
    "these are fields that , for various reasons , are missing either the v or r half of the spectrum .",
    "these fields have a reduced redshift yield because of the restricted access to redshifted spectral features , particularly in the case of missing r spectra .",
    "orphan field data are flagged in the database through the z_origin parameter ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "* re - examination of q=1 and q=2 spectra : *  all sources originally classified as either being extragalactic and @xmath10 , or non-2mass - selected ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath11 , have been re - examined .",
    "this was done primarily to improve the identification of faint high - redshift qsos .",
    "many qsos were poorly identified in the early stages of the survey due to the absence of suitable qso templates for redshifting .",

    "* image examination of all q=6 sources and re - redshifting : *  in the initial redshifting effort , 6212 sources were classified as @xmath12 ( i.e.  confirmed galactic sources with @xmath76 ) on the basis of their spectra and redshifts alone .",
    "once spectral and imaging data were assembled side - by - side in the 6dfgs database , it was straightforward to examine the postage - stamp images of these sources , given their spectral classification .",
    "most were confirmed as being true galactic sources ( stars , hii regions , planetary nebulae , ysos ) , or galactic objects in close proximity to an extragalactic source .",
    "a small number were also found to be 2mass imaging artefacts , or parts of larger objects .",
    "however , a significant number ( 847 ) were found to be galaxies with near - zero redshifts , which were subsequently re - redshifted and re - classified , and updated in the database . in some cases , even though the source was clearly a galaxy on the basis of its imaging , its true redshift could not be obtained .",
    "the most common causes were scattered light from a nearby star , or contamination from a foreground screen of galactic emission . 10 . * anomalous @xmath38@xmath5 sources with q=3,4 : *",
    "the @xmath38@xmath5 magnitude - redshift relation was used to identify anomalous redshifts ( @xmath7 ) outside the envelope normally spanned by this relation at typical 6dfgs redshifts .",
    "the postage - stamp images of these sources were compared to their spectra and redshifts to decide if the initial redshift was incorrect .",
    "there were 120 objects deemed to have an anomalous @xmath38@xmath5 ; 94 were found to have incorrect redshifts , which were re - examined and re - incorporated into the database",

    "the resulting spectra from affected fields show a small wavelength offset ( greater than @xmath77  and up to a few  ) , dependent on fibre number .",
    "the v and r spectral halves were sometimes affected individually , and at other times in unison .",
    "instances of shifting were isolated by comparing the wavelength of the [ oi]@xmath785577.4  sky line , as measured from the 6dfgs spectra , to its true value .",
    "a search found 125 affected fields able to be satisfactorily fit ( measured [ oi ] against fibre number ) and redshift corrected . in all , 18438 galaxies were corrected in this way ( approximately 14 percent of the entire sample of _ all _ spectra ) , with corrections @xmath79 .",
    "redshift template values kbestr were used to determine whether to apply a correction .",
    "if an object used @xmath80 ( corresponding to early - type galaxy templates ) , the redshift was deemed to be due to absorption - lines , which occur predominantly in the v half .",

    "correction for template offset values : *  various tests comparing 6dfgs redshifts to independent measurements found small systematic offsets in the case of a couple of templates .",
    "the discrepancy is almost certainly due to a zero - point error in the velocity calibration of the template spectra .",
    "this effect was discovered prior to dr2 and is discussed in @xcite , although no corrections were applied to the affected redshifts in that release . for this final release , corrections of @xmath83  have been applied to redshifts derived from templates @xmath84 .",
    "the corrected redshifts are both the raw ( z ) and heliocentric ( z_helio ) redshifts .",
    "the redshift offsets were found to be consistent between a 2004 comparison of 16127 6dfgs and zcat redshifts , and a 2007 comparison of 443 redshifts from various peculiar velocity surveys @xcite . 13 . * telluric sky line subtraction : *  the redshifting software used by 6dfgs automatically removed telluric absorption lines from spectra , but",
    "the database spectra have hitherto retained their imprint .",
    "for the final release we have re - spliced spectra and incorporated telluric line removal . an example spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : example ]",
    ". a small number of spectra which failed to re - splice successfully have had their old telluric - affected versions retained .",
    "* spurious clustering : *  the entire sample of reliable redshifts ( @xmath7 ) was tested for spurious clusters , caused by any systematic effect that produces noticeable numbers of objects from the same field with nearly identical redshifts .",
    "possible causes include poor sky subtraction and/or splicing of spectra , and the fibre cross - talk effect discussed in item ( v ) .",
    "fields containing at least 16 cases of galaxy groups ( 3 or more members ) with redshift differences of less than 30  had their redshifts re - examined : 171 galaxies from 7 fields .",
    "no prior knowledge of real galaxy clustering was used for the re - redshifting , and the database was updated with new redshifts and quality assignments .",
    "the field 0058m30 was particularly prominent with 48 galaxies at or near an apparent redshift of 0.1590 .",
    "this was due to the over - subtraction and subsequent mis - identification of the 7600   telluric absorption band with redshifted h@xmath85 .",

    "the hydra wall then extends roughly parallel to the zoa before separating into two distinct filaments at the adjacent hydra / antlia clusters , both of which extend into the zoa . behind these , at @xmath94 to 0.02 , a separate filament incorporates the norma and centaurus - crux clusters , and encompasses the putative great attractor region ( * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig : pieouter ] similarly displays the local universe out to @xmath97 with hitherto unseen detail and sky coverage .",
    "while it extends and confirms the now familiar labyrinth of filaments and voids , it also reveals evidence of inhomogeneity on a still larger scale  the plot for @xmath98 ( middle right panel ) is a good example .",

    "the correspondence between the largest - scale superclusters and voids seen in both surveys at @xmath104 is clear .",
    "our southernmost projection ( @xmath105 ) confirms the most distant ( pavo ) of the three tentative superclusters of @xcite while indicating that the other two are not major overdensities .",
    "we point out that this southern region is where 6dfgs coverage is generally lowest , with below - average completeness between 0  hr and 6  hr and around the pole ( poor sky coverage ) , and at 11  hr to 17  hr ( zoa ) .",

    "in addition to encompassing well - known superclusters such as shapley and hydra - centaurus , the 6dfgs data reveal a wealth of new intervening structures .",
    "the greater depth and sampling density of 6dfgs compared to earlier surveys of equivalent sky coverage has confirmed hundreds of voids and furnished first redshifts for around 400 southern abell clusters @xcite .",
    "more detailed quantitative analyses of 6dfgs large - scale structure will be the subject of future publications .",
    "the unprecedented combination of angular coverage and depth in 6dfgs offers the best chance yet to minimise systematics in the determination of the luminosity and stellar mass functions of low - redshift galaxies , both in the near - infrared and optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while surveys containing @xmath109-galaxy redshifts ( such as 6dfgs ) have now reduced random errors to comparable levels of high precision , systematic errors remain the dominant source of the differences between surveys .",
    "for example , the evolutionary corrections that initially beset comparisons between 2dfgrs and sdss ( cf . * ? ? ?",
