    "does star formation take a long time , or is it all over on a dynamical free - fall timescale ?",
    "this is a keenly debated question in star formation theory , with implications spanning topics as diverse as investigating early star / disk / planet evolution using populations in young star formation regions ( sfrs ) which are often _ assumed to be coeval _ , through to assessing overall star formation efficiency and the build up of galactic populations .    according to one paradigm ,",
    "the collapse of molecular clouds is a quasi - static process slowed by magnetic pressure .",
    "the timescale for star formation is governed by ambipolar diffusion and could be @xmath0myr ( e.g. tan , krumholz & mckee 2006 ) . alternatively , on the basis of short deduced molecular cloud lifetimes , others argue that star formation is a rapid process , taking place in compressed filamentary structures on free - fall timescales @xmath1myr ( e.g. elmegreen 2007 ) .",
    "a crucial piece of evidence for star formation timescales is the presence ( or not ) of age spreads among stars in young sfrs .",
    "low - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars can be assigned model - dependent ages from their position in hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagrams as they contract along hayashi tracks . using this technique several authors ( e.g. palla & stahler 2000 ; huff & stahler 2006 ) claim star formation `` accelerates '' exponentially up to the present day , on timescales of @xmath2myr . these apparent age spreads favour quasi - static , `` slow '' star formation .",
    "however , conventional h - r diagrams are severely affected by ( i ) intrinsic variability , ( ii ) extinction uncertainties , ( iii ) accretion luminosity , ( iv ) binarity , ( v ) distance dispersion  all of which can mimic age spreads where none exist ( e.g. hartmann 2001 ; hillenbrand , bauermeister & white 2008 ) .    in this contribution",
    "i illustrate a technique to circumvent these difficulties using the rotational properties of pms stars .",
    "this produces an alternative h - r diagram ( radius versus temperature ) that can be modelled to reconstruct a star formation history free from the problems above ( e.g. see jeffries 2007a , b ) .",
    "new wide - field surveys are finding rotation periods ( @xmath3 in days ) for hundreds of magnetically spotted pms stars in sfrs . at the same time",
    ", it is now possible to obtain projected equatorial velocities ( @xmath4 in kms@xmath5 ) for these stars from rotational line broadening using multi - object spectrographs such as flames at the vlt and hectoechelle at the mmt .",
    "combining these measurements gives geometric estimates of radii , @xmath6 ( in solar radii ) .",
    "the inclination angle , @xmath7 , is unknown , but if it is assumed random ( for which there is some evidence ",
    "e.g. jackson & jeffries in these proceedings  and no counter evidence ) and the measurement uncertainties are understood , then distributions of @xmath8 can be monte - carlo modelled to estimate the true @xmath9 for any group of stars .    as an example of the technique s power , in fig .",
    "1 i show a _ simulation _ of what could be achieved by observing projected equatorial velocities for 458 pms objects with rotation periods in the young sfr ngc  2264 ( from lamm et al .",
    "2004 and makidon et al .",
    "2004 ) , with a 10% precision and a threshold for detection of @xmath10kms@xmath5  which is routinely possible .",
    "the simulation assumes that rotation axes are randomly oriented but that objects with @xmath11 do not show rotational modulation .",
    "the left hand panels show the recovered @xmath12 values versus @xmath13 for coeval populations at several ages , where the siess , dufour & forestini ( 2000 , s00 ) isochrones are used to assign the intrinsic stellar radii . the right hand",
    "panels collapse this distribution to 1-dimensional form by normalising @xmath12 at each colour by the value of @xmath9 at 3myr .    with typical measurements ,",
    "a set of 20 @xmath12 values can give @xmath9 to @xmath14 .",
    "but at a given colour or @xmath15 , @xmath9 is expected to change by a factor of three between 1 and 10myr ! hence the @xmath12 distribution is _ very sensitive _ to age differences and age dispersions in this range ( see right panels of fig .  1 ) , but becomes less so at older ages .",
    "any inferred ages and age spreads are of course model - dependent , but the radii are absolute .",
    "the technique is almost immune to problems associated with variability , binarity , extinction uncertainty and accretion luminosity .",
    "it is also distance - independent to boot !     values that would be obtained from a sample of 458 periodic pms stars in the young sfr ngc  2264 .",
    "the left hand panels show @xmath12 values versus colour assuming random rotation axis orientation and that only @xmath4 values @xmath16kms@xmath5 are detectable .",
    "the right hand panels show the 1-dimensional collapsed distribution obtained by normalising by the expected radius at an age of 3myr .",
    "the simulations include typical measurement uncertainties in colour , @xmath17 and period .",

    "the results were described in detail by jeffries ( 2007b ) and are summarised here .",
    "the onc is a young and populous sfr with a sample of 95 k- and m - stars that have measured rotation periods ( herbst et al .",

    "i calculated @xmath12 for these stars and then simulated the normalised ( to @xmath22 ) distributions using the monte carlo model which produced the simulations in fig .  1 .",
    "the models were tested against the observed data using the kolmogorov - smirnoff statistic on the cumulative distributions .",
    "the simulations are insensitive to the threshold @xmath7 below which it is assumed no rotational periodicity would be found , but _ are _ sensitive to the choice of radius isochrones .",
    "i ran models using the s00 and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 , dam97 ) isochrones .",
    "uncertainties in periods , @xmath17 and @xmath15 were taken from the sources cited above .",
    "the first models i tried were coeval with the age as a free parameter . the best - fitting ages were 1.78myr and 0.76myr for the s00 and dam97 isochrones , but both were rejected as good models at the @xmath23 level ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "new models were generated by allowing the radius to spread around a single coeval value .",
    "the spread was characterised by a gaussian @xmath21 in @xmath20 .",
    "these generated good fits with central ages very similar to the previous coeval model , but with @xmath24dex ( 90% confidence interval ) for both sets of isochrones ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this implies linear radius spreads of a factor of 23 ( fwhm ) at a given @xmath15 .    rather than a simple radius spread it is natural to interpret the results in terms of an age spread .",
    "i fitted two types of analytic age spread : a gaussian spread ( @xmath25 ) in @xmath26age about a central value @xmath27 or an exponentially accelerating star forming rate with timescale @xmath28 and an abrupt cut - off ( or zero - point ) age @xmath29 finally , i modelled the @xmath12 distribution by assuming that the stars had the age distribution implied by their positions in the h - r diagram ( assuming an onc distance of 392pc",
    " jeffries 2007a ) .    age ( top row , with free parameters of a central age and dispersion @xmath25 in dex ) and an exponentially accelerating star formation rate ( bottom row , with free parameters of a timescale @xmath28 and a zero - point cut - off age . for each model",

    ", width=489 ]     distribution modelled using the age distribution for the rotation sample in the left - hand panel is a reasonable fit to the observed @xmath12 distribution .",
    ", width=499 ]    there are three main results , summarised below .    1 .",
    "both classes of model require an age spread ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ",
    "see fig.3 ) . for the gaussian model",
    "the best fitting dispersion @xmath32dex is independent of isochrone choice , but with model - dependent central ages similar to those given by the coeval models .",
    "the exponential model has a best - fitting @xmath33myr for the dam97 isochrones and @xmath34myr for the s00 isochrones .",
    "2 .   the data are incapable of distinguishing between the exponentially accelerating model or the gaussian spread in @xmath26age .",
    "3 .   modelling the @xmath12 distribution using the ages derived from the h - r diagram ( see fig .",
    "4 ) gives a reasonable fit for both sets of isochrones .",
    "although the absolute ages and age dispersions derived with this technique are to some extent model - dependent , the absolute radii and radius dispersion are geometric estimates .",
    "we conclude that there is very strong evidence for spreads amounting to factors of 2 - 3 ( fwhm ) in radius at a given @xmath35 in pms stars of the onc . as pms tracks are close - to - vertical in the h - r diagram for low - mass stars , this implies order - of - magnitude spreads in moment of inertia  a fact that can not be ignored when considering the angular momentum evolution of pms stars in sfrs .",
    "whether these radius spreads represent real age spreads is a moot point .",
    "it is possible that differing accretion histories could lead to luminosity / radius differences for coeval stars of similar present - day @xmath15 .",
    "however , according to current , non - accreting models , the data imply age spreads in the onc that are larger than its mean age ( @xmath36myr for the s00 models ) , consistent with age spreads judged from its conventional h - r diagram , and certainly large enough to compromise any coeval assumption . in addition , the spreads we have found may actually be underestimates . the rotation sample in the onc is clearly biased against the faintest ( possibly oldest ? ) stars ( see fig .  4 )",
    "we can not comment on whether age spreads as large as 10myr are likely until these low - luminosity outliers in the onc have their periods and projected rotation velocities measured ."
