    "recent observations of a hourglass shaped excitation spectrum in cuprate superconductors point towards an underlying universal magnetic excitation spectrum for all of the cuprates@xcite . in insulating charge stripe ordered la@xmath7sr@xmath8coo@xmath4 an hourglass magnetic excitation spectrum has been observed , and explained within a charge stripe model with a weak inter - stripe spin interaction , relative to the intra - stripe spin interaction@xcite .",
    "the magnetic excitations of la@xmath7sr@xmath8coo@xmath4 indicate that the underlying magnetism of the cuprates can originate from charge stripe fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the lack of an hour glass excitation spectrum in charge stripe ordered la@xmath2sr@xmath3nio@xmath4 is explained by the strong inter - stripe spin interaction of these materials .",
    "the dispersion of the magnetic excitations of charge stripe ordered la@xmath0nio@xmath1 deviates from the theory that describes the magnetic excitations in la@xmath7sr@xmath8coo@xmath4 and la@xmath2sr@xmath3nio@xmath4 @xmath9 @xcite . in a limited energy range , @xmath1010 - 30mev , the centre of the magnetic excitations shifts inwards towards the two dimensional antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath11 .",
    "if the inter - stripe spin interaction was weak , the excitations would be expected to disperse towards @xmath12 , but the inter - stripe spin interaction of la@xmath0nio@xmath1 is strong@xcite . as the inter - stripe spin interaction",
    "is mediated by the charge stripe electrons , it is important to ascertain what are the magnetic properties of the charge stripe electrons of la@xmath0nio@xmath1 . in la@xmath2sr@xmath3nio@xmath4",
    "@xmath13 we have observed the charge stripe electrons have gapped quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin correlations ( q-1d ) along the charge stripes@xcite .",
    "a single crystals of la@xmath0nio@xmath1 ( @xmath14 ) was grown by the floating - zone technique@xcite .",
    "the sample used here was also used in our previous neutron studies of @xmath14 @xcite , and is a rod of 8 mm diameter and 40 mm length .",
    "thermo - gravimetric analysis ( tga ) of an as - grown crystal determined the oxygen excess to be @xmath15 .",
    "data on the bulk magnetization of an as - grown crystal are published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "neutron scattering measurements were performed on the triple - axis spectrometers in20 at the ill , and on puma at frm - ii .",
    "the energies of the incident and scattered neutrons were selected by bragg reflection from crystal heusler arrays ( in20 ) , or arrays of pyrolytic graphite crystals ( puma ) .",
    "the monochromators were horizontally focused on both instruments , and vertically focused on puma , to maximise neutron flux on the sample position .",
    "the analyzers were horizontally focused on both instruments and vertically focused on puma .",
    "data were collected with a fixed final neutron wavevector of 2.662@xmath16 .",
    "a pyrolytic graphite filter was placed between the sample and analyzer to suppress higher - order harmonic scattering . on in20",
    "polarized neutrons were employed , and the neutron spin polarization @xmath17 was maintained in a specified orientation with respect to the neutron scattering vector @xmath18 by an adjustable guide field of a few mt at the sample position .",
    "a monitor is placed between the monochromator and sample position to determine the number of neutrons incident on the sample position .",
    "we aligned the crystal so that the horizontal scattering plane was @xmath19 ( we refer here to the tetragonal unit cell of the space group @xmath20 with unit cell parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "on in20 the sample was mounted in a standard orange cryostat , and on puma the sample was mounted in a closed cycle refrigerator .",
    "we performed longitudinal polarized neutron scattering measurements on in20 . for these measurements we constrained the neutron polarization @xmath17 to be parallel to the scattering vector @xmath18 . in this",
    "configuration scattering from electronic magnetic moments causes the neutron spin to flip , whereas scattering via non - magnetic processes does not .    in figure",
    "[ fig : elastic ] we show an elastic scan of the @xmath14 parallel to @xmath23 through the the magnetic bragg reflections at @xmath24 . in the spin flip ( sf ) data two sharp bragg reflections are observed at @xmath25 r.l.u . and @xmath26 r.l.u .",
    "from the magnetic order . in the non - spin flip channel ( nsf ) weaker bragg reflections are observed due to the imperfect polarization of the neutron beam .",
    "the ratio of the intensities of the nsf and sf bragg reflections gives a flipping ratio of 19 .    in figure",

    "the data has been corrected for the imperfact neutron polariztion@xcite . in the nsf channel",
    "no excitation peaks are observed , whereas in the sf channel a broad magnetic excitation peak centred on @xmath28 r.l.u . is observed . as the dispersion gradient of excitations from the ordered ni@xmath29 @xmath30 ordered spins is effectively infinite at 2.5mev",
    ", they only account for the left hand side of the sf peak .",
    "the right hand side of the excitation centred on @xmath31 is an unaccounted for antiferromagnetic excitation , that has no elastic component .    at 2.5mev",
    "we are below the out of plane anisotropy gap in @xmath14 , and the spins fluctuate around the ordered moment in the ni - o plane@xcite . for a wavevector along @xmath23 at 2.5mev",
    "only the component of the spin fluctutaions perpendicular to this direction are probed .",
    "if the spin excitations are observed at a wavector of the same length that is appproximately along @xmath32 , all the in plane spin fluctuations are probed and the intensity of the observed excitation will increase .",
    "the q-1d in the @xmath5 was determined to preferentially fluctuate out of the ni - o plane@xcite .",
    "if the q-1d is measured at a wavector appproximately along @xmath32 the intensity will decrease compared to a wavevector along @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig : polinelastic ] ( b ) shows a polarized neutron scan of the magnetic excitations along @xmath34 which shows two peaks in the sf channel . in fig.[fig : polinelastic ] ( a ) and ( b ) the symmetry of scans reverses , so that the right hand side peak in ( b ) is from the ordered ni@xmath29 spins , which has increased in intensity as expected .",
    "if the sf peak on the left of fig.[fig : polinelastic ] ( b ) was from q-1d excitations that preferential fluctuate out of the ni - o plane , the intensity of these excitations will be weaker in fig.[fig : polinelastic ] ( b ) than fig.[fig : polinelastic ] ( a ) , as observed .    the polarized neutron scattering measurements of @xmath14 at 2.5mev show two magnetic excitations .",
    "we have shown that one of these excitation modes is gapped with no elastic component , and has the same wavevector dependence for intensity as the q-1d in @xmath5 and @xmath35 .",
    "after confirming the existence of a second magnetic excitation in @xmath14 , we studied the energy and temperature dependence of this magnetic excitation using unpolarized neutron scattering .",
    "figure [ fig : eandt ] ( a ) we show three scans parallel to @xmath33 at @xmath36 of the @xmath14 at 4.2k . as we were able to collect significant neutron counts in the data , we clearly observe the lorentzian lineshape of the excitations , consistent with our previous results@xcite . at 2mev and @xmath37 a small side peak is clearly resolved from the excitations from the order moments .",
    "the centring of this excitation agrees with the flexing of the q-1d observed in @xmath13@xcite . at 4mev",
    "the excitations at @xmath38 and @xmath39 are observed to have reduced counts compared to 2mev , and by 6mev the excitations have broadened to become an extended tail to the excitation peaks from the ordered moments . when the q-1d of @xmath5 is scanned in an equivalent way to fig .",
    "[ fig : eandt ] ( a ) , the q-1d is qualitatively observed to follow the same trend . unfortunately the fitting uncertainties for the data fits of the 4mev and 6mev data in fig .",
    "[ fig : eandt ] ( a ) do not allow for a meaningful quantative comparison .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eandt ] ( b ) we show a scan parallel to @xmath33 at @xmath36 for 4mev of the @xmath14 , taken at 20k .",
    "the scan at 20k is well described by a fit of two lorentzians on a sloping background , as indicated by the solid line of fig .",
    "[ fig : eandt ] ( b ) . in the @xmath5 , on increasing temperature the q=1d remains observable to temperatures well in excess of 20k@xcite , unlike the scan at 20k of the @xmath14 .",
    "the lack of observable q-1d at 20k for @xmath14 may be a result of the fit , with the sloping background and the lorentzian lineshape incorrectly accounting for the q-1d .",
    "additional measurements in the @xmath40 scattering plane away from the excitations from the order ni@xmath29 spins , should resolve this issue .",
    "we have presented experimental evidence of a second magnetic excitation mode in charge stripe ordered la@xmath0nio@xmath1 . a preferential polarization of the fluctuations out of the ni - o plane , and the energy dependence of the magnetic excitations is consistent with the gapped quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnetic excitations of the charge stripe electrons ( q-1d ) in la@xmath2sr@xmath3nio@xmath4 @xmath13 .",
    "the main components of the ground state magnetic excitations in la@xmath0nio@xmath1 , the out of plane anistropy gap , the inter- and intra - stripe interactions , and the q-1d observed in this work , are unchanged compared to la@xmath2sr@xmath3nio@xmath4 @xmath13@xcite .    despite the lack of differences in the magnetic interactions of la@xmath0nio@xmath1 and la@xmath2sr@xmath3nio@xmath4 @xmath13 , the ground state magnetic excitations from the order ni@xmath29 spins in the energy range 10 - 30mev",
    "have remarkable differences . in la@xmath0nio@xmath1",
    "there is an inward dispersion of the magnetic excitations towards @xmath11@xcite , whereas in la@xmath2sr@xmath3nio@xmath4 @xmath13 there is a partial gapping of the spin excitations accompanied by a resonance like feature at the magnetic zone centre@xcite .",
    "as the main magnetic interactions in these two materials are unaltered , we require further interactions to fully explain the magnetic excitation spectrums in the charge stripe ordered nickelates . as our previous studies for @xmath13 have indicated , we need to research beyond the magnetic interactions to understand these striking phenomena @xcite .",
