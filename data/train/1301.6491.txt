    "shannon s theory and its modern extensions quantify the quality of communications channels ( ergodic capacity , finite block errors , error exponents , etc . ) in a probabilistic manner by considering averages over codewords and channel characteristics ( noise , fading , etc . ) . for communication networks with many channels",
    ", it has been recently suggested to use a stochastic geometric approach  @xcite consisting in taking spatial averages over node ( emitter , receiver ) locations .",
    "establishing clear connections between stochastic - geometric averages and basic information - theoretic notions may be difficult ( cf e.g.  @xcite ) but this approach for wireless networks has recently attracted a lot of attention .",
    "in particular , the fundamental characteristic , discovered in information theory , signal - to - noise - ratio is now being studied in many geometric contexts with the incorporation of interference .",
    "this paper contributes to this approach by considering the distribution of the signal - to - interference - and - noise - ratio ( sinr ) of a typical user on down - link channels from different base stations of a single - tier cellular network modelled by poisson point process on the plane . in particular",
    ", it complements  @xcite , by providing explicit characterization of low ( less than one ) values of sinr .",
    "current cellular - network technology allows for effective use of such sinr regimes , whence our motivation comes .",
    "cellular network models based on the poisson point process have been shown to give tractable and accurate solutions  @xcite , with the poisson assumption being justified by representing highly irregular base station deployments in urban areas  @xcite or mimicking strong log - normal shadowing  @xcite , or both .",
    "knowledge of the distribution of @xmath2 allows to calculate key performance indicators of cellular networks , e.g. spectral efficiency  @xcite   or energy efficiency  @xcite .",
    "it can also be ( non - trivially ) related to user - level quality - of - service metrics .    in studying the sinr of a given user with respect to the base station with",
    "the greatest received signal , the main difficulty for small values of sinr is taking into account _",
    "multiple coverage_. simple algebra shows that there can be at most one base station offering a given user @xmath3 , and hence the probability of having at least one station covering at this level reduces to the sum of probabilities of sinr - coverage over all base stations .",
    "however , this is not the case for @xmath1 , where one needs to study probabilities of simultaneous coverage by several base stations .",
    "we express these probabilities via the so - called _ symmetric sums _ and relate them to the appropriate partitioning of the sinr domain for @xmath4 , which are the main ideas behind this paper .",
    "our signal propagation - loss model consists of the deterministic power - law path - loss function and independent ( across all base stations ) , arbitrarily distributed shadowing .",
    "as previously observed  @xcite , any characteristic involving only the sequence of propagation - loss values experienced by a given user from all base stations entirely depend on the distribution of the shadowing via its moment of order @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the path - loss exponent .",
    "we also study the impact of rayleigh fading on the sinr coverage by incorporating into the propagation - loss model additional independent ( across all base stations ) random variables with exponential distributions . assuming that fading affects the sinr coverage condition but not the choice of the serving base station",
    ", we observe that it worsens the coverage particularly at small values of sinr .",
    "the sinr coverage in a multi - tier network was studied in  @xcite for @xmath7 .",
    "two different approaches to express the distribution of the sinr in its whole domain , both involving inversion of laplace transforms , were presented in  @xcite .",
    "our expressions , which involve two key families of integrals ( over the positive real line and a hyper - cube respectively ) are much more tractable in numerical evaluation . our model with fading",
    "was recently examined in  @xcite under slightly more general assumptions .",
    "we revisit it in order to present more closed - form expressions under our specific assumptions , and compare the coverage probabilities obtained in it to these in the model without fading .",
    "on @xmath8 , we model the base stations with a homogeneous poisson point process @xmath9 with density @xmath10 .",
    "given @xmath9 , let @xmath11 be a collection of independent and identically distributed random variables , that represent the _ shadowing _ experienced between station @xmath12 and a typical user located , without loss of generality , at the origin .",
