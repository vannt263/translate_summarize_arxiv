    "the objective of the current experiment is to validate _ x2abundance _ developed for c1xs analysis using samples that are analogous to lunar surface composition .",
    "these samples contain elements from mg to fe whose k - shell x - ray emission energies ranges from @xmath1 1.2 kev to @xmath1 7.0 kev .",
    "lunar surface can broadly be classified into two regions viz . , ( a ) dark mare regions ( high mafic content ) and ( b ) bright highland regions ( concentration of low dense minerals with low mafic content ) .",
    "the mare regions are believed to be the partial melts of lunar interior erupted on the surface . whereas , highlands are believed to be formed during the end stages of lunar magma ocean where the lighter mineral plagioclase feldspar floated and crystallized on the surface . for our experiment ,",
    "two samples which closely represent the composition of lunar mare and highland region are used .",
    "a brief description of the samples used are given here :    * lunar simulant ( jsc-1a ) : jsc-1a is a lunar mare regolith simulant released by nasa for research studies mined from a commercial cinder quarry at merriam crater ( 35@xmath2 20 n , 111@xmath2 17 w ) .",
    "the volcanic ash deposit of merriam crater is basaltic in composition , similar to the soil from maria terrain of the moon .",
    "the mined ash was processed to produce the simulants with mean grain size of @xmath1 190 @xmath3 m .",
    "a complete characterization of lunar simulant ( jsc-1a ) is reported by @xcite . + * sittampundi rock : this sample is taken from the anorthositic rocks available at sittampundi ( near salem , tamil nadu ) , india , which are considered close to lunar highland rocks in composition .",
    "the plagioclase in these rock samples exhibit an anorthite content in the range an@xmath4 @xcite in comparison to that in apollo returned samples which has an anorthite content of @xmath1 an@xmath5 on average .",
    "pure calcic - anorthite and labradorite are the dominant minerals in this sample .",
    "the sample exhibit a low mafic content and large concentration of al and ca .",
    "they are pulverized to a grain size of about 100 @xmath3 m or smaller .",
    "detailed studies on the rocks of this site are reported by @xcite .",
    "pellets of these samples were made after crushing them manually and compressing it with a pelletizer .",
    "we assume that the pellets are a close representation of flat and homogeneous sample",
    ". however , in reality the size distribution of soil particles on the moon is not well characterized .",
    "it is shown already that , in heterogeneous samples , the observed xrf line strength exhibit a dependence on grain size @xcite , which is assumed to be minimal for c1xs observations due to large spatial scales @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of experimental setup is given in the following section .      as the samples contain diverse elements ranging from mg to fe , we irradiated the samples using a high intense mono - energetic synchrotron x - ray beam . for this purpose",
    ", we have utilized the xrf-@xmath3 probe beam - line ( bl-16 ) at indus-2 synchrotron beam facility , rrcat , indore , india .",
    "the indus-2 electron storage ring is currently operating at 2.5 gev with nominal current of 100 ma .",
    "bl-16 of indus-2 is installed on the 5@xmath2 port of bending magnet and operates under high vacuum condition of 10@xmath6 mbar .",
    "it is designed to work in the photon energy range of 4 - 20 kev . a double crystal monochromator ( dcm ) with a pair of symmetric and asymmetric si ( 111 ) crystals ( mounted side - by - side )",
    "is placed @xmath1 19 m away from the source .",
    "it provides a mono - energetic beam , which in our case is 8.0 kev , with an energy resolution ( @xmath7e / e ) of @xmath1 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9 .",
    "various salient features of bl-16 beamline and setup are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the measured energy resolution ( @xmath7e / e ) of the beamline is found to be @xmath1 1.34 @xmath10 10@xmath9 at 10 kev .",
    "+ however , it is to be noted that the x - rays from solar flares exciting the moon is mostly a thermal continuum along with many emission lines that dominates in soft x - rays ( @xmath0 8 kev ) , which also exhibit spectral variability in time . under such circumstances , the effect of surface roughness and",
    "grain size coupled with observational geometry on xrf line strength becomes important , which is not currently addressed in this work .",
    "+ for the current experiment , the second crystal of dcm is detuned slightly to avoid higher order bragg reflections from the dcm .",
    "the sample holder is placed at 45@xmath2 with respect to the incident beam direction .",
    "the monochromatic beam is allowed to pass through an ionization chamber for monitoring incident flux ( i@xmath11 ) reaching the sample .",
    "the fluorescent / scattered x - rays emitted from the sample are detected using a solid state si pin detector ( xr-100cr - 160 ev at 5.9 kev ; amptek , inc .",

    "a collimated mono - energetic x - ray beam of energy 8 kev and size @xmath1 1 mm @xmath10 1 mm , is used for the sample excitation .",
    "all xrf measurements are done inside a vacuum chamber made out of stainless steel ( ss-304 ) with pressure of @xmath1 10@xmath12 mbar .",
    "( [ photo_catvac ] ) shows the photograph of the experimental arrangement at bl-16 .",

    "sittampundi rock excited by an intense 8 kev mono - energetic beam are shown in fig .",
    "( [ specfitsjsc ] & [ specfitsano ] ) .",
    "xrf lines of low z elements like al , si , k are clearly visible in the spectrum which are modeled as gaussian functions .",
    "x - ray signature of mg is not seen in the spectrum of jsc-1a due to reduced efficiency of the detector at lower energies around 1 kev and also from a low probability to excite the relatively less abundant mg by a 8 kev beam .      the observed xrf spectra also exhibit lines from elements which are not present in the samples as well as a continuum background emission .",
    "reasons for these features seen in the spectrum and necessary corrections applied to derive the xrf line flux of the samples are discussed below :    * xrf lines of stainless steel arising from the vacuum chamber walls are clearly observed ( for example k-@xmath13 of cr @ 5.4 kev ) .",
    "this is probably due to the interaction of uncollimated scattered 8 kev beam with the walls of the vacuum chamber . as some of the elements in ss-304 are also present in the samples ( ref .",
    "( [ specfitsjsc ] ) ) , we have to estimate the contribution from ss-304 .",
    "for this , we derived the xrf spectrum of ss-304 excited by an 8 kev beam using geant4 monte carlo simulation .",
    "* scattered continuum components of 8 kev incident beam : viz . , rayleigh ( elastic ) and compton ( inelastic ) are also prominently seen in the observed spectra ( ref .",
    "fig.([specfitsjsc ] & [ specfitsano ] ) ) .",
    "earlier experiments by @xcite were performed with a lower intensity x - ray beam and hence did not reveal the presence of scattering components . to model the scattered components , using apriori composition , we simulated both elastic and inelastic scattered spectrum in geant4 .",
    "we generated table models of the xrf spectrum of ss-304 and scatter component spectrum ( elastic and inelastic ) which are compatible for xspec analysis .",
    "table models used in xspec are user defined models containing a grid of spectra and range of parameter values used in the model . while fitting the data , normalization of the differential flux is allowed to vary , retaining the the spectral profile .",
    "* the samples also contain many trace elements ( in ppm ) which are mostly high z ( for jsc-1a ex .",
    "ni , zr , sr , ce , ba etc . , ) .",
    "many of these exhibit numerous l- lines which lie very close to / overlap xrf lines of major elements ( for eg : l - lines of ba lie close to ti & cr k - lines ; sr l - lines lie close to si k - lines ) in the samples .",
    "presence of these trace element line features are clearly seen in the residuals in fig .",

    "xrf lines of mg , na and o could not be seen in the spectrum of jsc-1a due to the reduced effective area of the detector below 1.2 kev .",
