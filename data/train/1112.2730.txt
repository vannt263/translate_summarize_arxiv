    "recently , water waves with vorticity , also called rotational waves , are investigated extensively .",
    "there have been a series of works concerning rotational waves , including existence results for small- and large - amplitude waves @xcite , as well as results on uniqueness and symmetry , analyticity of wave profile @xcite , and so on .",
    "the present work is mainly concerned with the analyticity or regularity results for rotational water waves , with or without surface tension .",
    "assuming that the vorticity function is hlder continuously differentiable , constantin and strauss @xcite proved , by using methods of bifurcation theory , the existence of global bifurcation branches consisting of periodic water waves which travel above a flat bottom with constant speed exceeding that of the water particles enclosed by the wave .",
    "the assumption that the wave speed exceeds that of the water particles is supported by field evidence @xcite , and means that the waves are not near breaking or stagnation .",
    "we consider such waves as well in this paper .",
    "in the irrotational setting , a classical result due to lewy @xcite showed that irrotational waves without stagnation points have real analytic profiles , by use of a generalized schwartz reflection principle .",
    "recently , constantin and escher @xcite generalized this result to rotational case , and proved that , under the same assumption on the vorticity function as in @xcite , namely hlder continuity of the first derivative , each streamline , except the free surface , is real analytic ; if further the vorticity function is real analytic , then the free surface itself is also analytic . the arguments in @xcite base on translational invariance property of the resulting operator in the direction of wave propagation , and the celebrated result due to kinderlehrer et al .",
    "@xcite on regularity for elliptic free boundary problems .",
    "later on , similar results as in @xcite are obtained for deep - water waves @xcite , flows with merely bounded vorticity @xcite , solitary - water waves @xcite , and for periodic capillary - gravity waves @xcite where it was shown that the wave profile is furthermore @xmath2-smooth if the vorticity function is hlder continuously differentiable . note that in the aforementioned works the analyticity of free surface is established under the extra assumption that the vorticity function is analytic .",
    "it is natural to expect the analyticity of the free surface for flows with only hlder continuous vorticity .",
    "this is what we will do in this work .",
    "precisely , assuming that the vorticity function is only hlder continuous , we obtain the real analyticity of all the streamlines , including the free surface , of the steady flow over a flat bed in the absence of stagnation points .",
    "as in the above works , we first use an appropriate hodograph change of variable that transforms the free boundary value problem ( corresponding in a frame moving at the constant wave speed to the governing equations for water waves with vorticity ) into a nonlinear boundary problem for a quasi - linear elliptic equation in a fixed rectangular domain . then basing on some a priori schauder estimates",
    "( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.30 ) , and @xcite for general nonlinear elliptic equations with nonlinear oblique boundary conditions ) , we show the analyticity of streamlines by giving successively a quantitative bound for each derivative of the streamlines in the hlder norm .",
    "we also study the case when the vorticity possesses more regularity property rather than hlder continuity , namely gevrey regularity of index @xmath0 .",
    "gevrey class is an intermediate space between the spaces of smooth functions and analytic functions , and the gevrey class function of index @xmath1 is just the real - analytic function ; see subsection [ subsec result ] below for precise definition of gevrey class . in this case",
    "we investigate gevrey regularity of stream function throughout the fluid domain .",
    "if the vorticity is gevrey regular , we prove that the stream function admits the same gevrey regularity in the fluid domain , up to the free surface ; see theorem [ th2 ] stated in subsection [ subsec result ] . to obtain this",
    ", we firstly establish the corresponding regularity for the height function in a fixed rectangular domain , and then use the result of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) to show that the gevrey regularity is preserved through partial hodograph transformation .",
    "we conclude this introduction by pointing out that our approach applies for both periodic and solitary waves . for simplicity",
    "we consider in this work only flows with finite depth . with suitable modifications ,",
    "the methods may be employed to the periodic waves on deep water with vorticity , constructed in @xcite .",

    "consider a steady two - dimensional flow of an incompressible inviscid fluid over a rigid flat bed @xmath3 with @xmath4 , acted upon by gravity , and a steady wave on the free surface of the flow . by steady , we mean that the flow and the surface wave move at a constant speed from left to right without changing their configuration . in the frame of reference moving at the wave speed @xmath5 ,",
