    "it is generally assumed that our universe contains an approximately equal amount of leptons and antileptons .",

    "the existence of a large lepton asymmetry is restricted to be in the form of neutrinos from the requirement of universal electric neutrality , and the possibility of a large neutrino asymmetry is still open . from a particle physics point of view",
    ", a lepton asymmetry can be generated by an affleck - dine mechanism @xcite without producing a large baryon asymmetry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent model ) , or even by active - sterile neutrino oscillations after the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "we have studied some cosmological implications of relic degenerate neutrinos @xcite ( here degenerate refers to neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry , not to mass degeneracy ) .",
    "we do not consider any specific model for generating such an asymmetry , and just assume that it was created well before neutrinos decouple from the rest of the plasma .",
    "an asymmetry of order one or larger can have crucial effects on the global evolution of the universe . among other effects",
    ", it changes the decoupling temperature of neutrinos , the primordial production of light elements at bbn , the time of equality between radiation and matter , or the contribution of relic neutrinos to the present energy density of the universe .",
    "the latter changes affect the evolution of perturbations in the universe .",
    "we focus on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and on the distribution of large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "we calculate the power spectrum of both quantities , in the case of massless degenerate neutrinos , and also for neutrinos with a mass of @xmath0 ev , as suggested to explain the experimental evidence of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "the effect of neutrino degeneracy on the lss power spectrum was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , as a way of improving the agreement with observations of mixed dark matter models with ev neutrinos , in the case of high values of the hubble parameter .",
    "adams & sarkar @xcite calculated the cmb anisotropies and the matter power spectrum , and compared them with observations in the @xmath1 case for massless degenerate neutrinos .",
    "more recently , kinney & riotto @xcite also calculated the cmb anisotropies for massless degenerate neutrinos in the @xmath2 case .",
    "the energy density of one species of massive degenerate neutrinos and antineutrinos , described by the distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is ( we use @xmath5 units ) _ + _ |= _ 0^  p^2 ( f_(p ) + f_|(p ) ) [ defrhonu ] valid at any moment . here",
    "@xmath6 is the magnitude of the 3-momentum and @xmath7 is the neutrino mass .",
    "when the early universe was hot enough , the neutrinos were in equilibrium with the rest of the plasma via the weak interactions . in that case",
    "the distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 changed with the universe expansion , keeping the form of a fermi - dirac distribution , f_,|(p)= [ fd ] here @xmath8 is the neutrino chemical potential , which is nonzero if a neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry has been previously produced .",
    "later the neutrinos decoupled when they were still relativistic , and from that moment the neutrino momenta just changed according to the cosmological redshift .",
    "if @xmath9 is the expansion factor , the neutrino momentum decreases keeping @xmath10 constant . at the same time",
    "the neutrino degeneracy parameter @xmath11 is conserved , with a value equal to that at the moment of decoupling .",
    "therefore one can still calculate the energy density of neutrinos now from and , replacing @xmath12 by @xmath13 and @xmath14 by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 k and @xmath17 is the present ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures , which is not unity because once decoupled the neutrinos did not share the entropy transfer to photons from the successive particle annihilations that occurred in the early universe . in the presence of a significant neutrino degeneracy @xmath13",
    "the decoupling temperature @xmath18 is higher than in the standard case , @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath19 of the weak processes , that keep the neutrinos in equilibrium with the other species , is reduced because some of the initial or final neutrino states will be occupied .",

    "therefore if @xmath13 is large enough , the degenerate neutrinos decouple before the temperature of the universe drops below the different mass thresholds , and are not heated by the particle - antiparticle annihilations , reducing the ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures with respect to the standard value @xmath23 .",
    "the present contribution of these degenerate neutrinos to the energy density of the universe can be parametrized as @xmath24 ev @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the neutrino energy density in units of the critical density @xmath27 , @xmath28 gev is the planck mass and @xmath29 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 is the hubble parameter .",

    "one recovers the well - known bound on the neutrino mass @xmath36 ev for @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , for very light neutrinos the horizontal lines set a maximum value on the neutrino degeneracy , that would correspond to a present neutrino chemical potential @xmath38 ev , also for @xmath39 . in the intermediate region of the figures",
    "the neutrino energy density is @xmath40 and the contours follow roughly the relation @xmath41 .",
    "a similar calculation has been recently performed in reference @xcite .",
    "note however that the ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures was not properly taken into account for large @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of a neutrino degeneracy can modify the outcome of bbn ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "first a larger neutrino energy density increases the expansion rate of the universe , thus enhancing the primordial abundance of @xmath42he .",
    "this is valid for a nonzero @xmath13 of any neutrino flavor .",
    "in addition if the degenerate neutrinos are of electron type , they have a direct influence over the weak processes that interconvert neutrons and protons .",
    "this last effect depends on the sign of @xmath43 , and one gets @xmath44 @xcite , while a sufficiently long matter dominated epoch requires @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this estimate agrees with our analysis in section [ comparison ] and places a limit shown by the horizontal line in figure [ lnumass ] in the case of degenerate @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath46    we compute the power spectra of cmb anisotropies and lss using the boltzmann code cmbfast by seljak & zaldarriaga @xcite , adapted to the case of one family of degenerate neutrinos ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , with mass @xmath7 and degeneracy parameter @xmath13 .",
    "our modifications to the code are reviewed and explained in @xcite .",
    "the effect of @xmath13 and @xmath49 on the cmb anisotropy spectrum can be seen in figure [ fig.cmb ] .",
    "we choose a set of cosmological parameters ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54k , flat primordial spectrum , no reionization , no tensor contribution ) , and we vary @xmath13 from 0 to 5 , both in the case of massless degenerate neutrinos and degenerate neutrinos with @xmath55 ev .",
    "let us first comment the massless case .",
    "the main effect of @xmath13 is to boost the amplitude of the first peak , where recombination can take place still at the end of radiation domination , and anisotropies are suppressed .",
    "however in such a case the location of the first peak is @xmath56 , and the matter power spectrum is strongly suppressed . ] . indeed , increasing the energy density of radiation delays matter - radiation equality , which is known to boost the acoustic peaks , and to shift them to higher multipoles , by a factor @xmath57 ( @xmath58 increases with @xmath13 , while the recombination scale factor @xmath59 is almost independent of the radiation energy density ) .",
    "secondary peaks are then more affected by diffusion damping at large @xmath60 , and their amplitude can decrease with @xmath13 .    in the case of degenerate neutrinos with @xmath55",
    "ev , the results are quite similar in first approximation .",
    "indeed , the effects described previously depend on the energy density of neutrinos at equality . at that time , they are still relativistic , and identical to massless neutrinos with equal degeneracy parameter . however , with a large degeneracy , @xmath61 today becomes significant : for @xmath62 , one has @xmath63 , i.e. the same order of magnitude as @xmath64 . since we are studying flat models , @xmath61 must be compensated by less baryons , cold dark matter ( cdm ) or @xmath65 . in our example , @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "are fixed , while @xmath66 slightly decreases .",
    "this explains the small enhancement of the first peak compared to the massless case ( 3.4% for @xmath62 ) . even if this effect is indirect , it is nevertheless detectable in principle , possibly by future satellite missions _",
    "map _ and _ planck _ ( even if one does not impose the flatness condition , the effect of @xmath61 will be visible through a modification of the curvature ) .",
    "we also plot in figure [ fig.cmb ] the power spectrum @xmath67 , normalized on large scales to cobe .",
    "the effect of both parameters @xmath13 and @xmath49 is now to suppress the power on small scales . indeed , increasing @xmath13 postpones matter - radiation equality , allowing less growth for fluctuations crossing the hubble radius during radiation domination . adding a small mass",
    "affects the recent evolution of fluctuations , and has now a direct effect : when the degenerate neutrinos become non - relativistic , their free - streaming suppresses the growth of fluctuations for scales within the hubble radius .",
    "this effect , already known for non - degenerate neutrinos @xcite , is enhanced in the presence of a neutrino degeneracy , since the average neutrino momentum is shifted to larger values .",
    "our results for massless degenerate neutrinos can be compared with those of previous works .",
    "we found the same effect of @xmath13 on the cmb for @xmath68 as in @xcite , while the revised results in @xcite also agree with our calculations for @xmath69 .",
    "since the degeneracy increases dramatically the amplitude of the first cmb peak , we expect large @xmath13 values to be favored in the case of cosmological models known to predict systematically a low peak ( unless a large blue tilt is invoked , which puts severe constraints on inflation ) .",
    "our goal here is not to explore systematically all possibilities , but to briefly illustrate how @xmath13 can be constrained by current observations for flat models with different values of @xmath65 .",
    "recent results from supernovae , combined with cmb constraints , favor flat models with @xmath70 .",
    "we choose a model with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath54k , no reionization and no tensor contribution , and look for the allowed window in the space of free parameters ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the allowed window is defined as the intersection of regions preferred at the 95% confidence level by four independent experimental tests , based on @xmath72 estimation , stromlo - apm redshift survey , bulk velocity reconstruction , and cmb anisotropy measurements .",
    "details concerning these tests can be found in @xcite .",
    "we plot in figure [ fig.win ] the lss and cmb allowed regions in ( @xmath13 , @xmath74 ) parameter space , for @xmath68 and @xmath75 . in the case of degenerate neutrinos with @xmath76",
    "ev , the lss regions are slightly shifted at large @xmath13 , since , as we saw , the effect of @xmath13 is enhanced ( dotted lines on the figure ) .",
    "the cmb regions do not show this distinction , given the smallness of the effect and the imprecision of the data .",
    "one can immediately see that lss and cmb constraints on @xmath74 are shifted in opposite direction with @xmath13 : indeed , the effects of @xmath13 and @xmath74 both produce a higher cmb peak , while to a certain extent they compensate each other in @xmath67 .",
    "so , for @xmath77 , a case in which a power spectrum normalized to both cobe and @xmath72 yields a too high peak . ]",
    ", a neutrino degeneracy can only make things worst , and we find no allowed window at all . in the other extreme case @xmath68 , it is well known that the amplitude required by @xmath72 and the shape probed by redshift surveys favor different values of @xmath74 .",
    "we find that the neutrino degeneracy can solve this problem with @xmath78 , but the allowed window is cut at @xmath79 by cmb data , and we are left with an interesting region in which @xmath80 models are viable .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite .",
    "however , current evidences for a low @xmath81 universe are independent of the constraints used here , so there are not many motivations at the moment to consider this window seriously .",
    "finally , for @xmath82 , a good agreement is found up to @xmath83 .",
    "this upper bound could marginally explain the generation of ultra - high energy cosmic rays by the annihilation of high - energetic neutrinos on relic neutrinos with mass @xmath84 ev @xcite ."
