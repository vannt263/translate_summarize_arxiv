    "exclusive vector meson production by real and virtual photons is a good probe to investigate the physics of diffractive scattering . whenever the coherence length of the photon is larger than the proton radius , it is preferable to study the process in the proton rest frame or in the center of mass frame where the virtual photon can be considered as a hadronic system composed of partons . in this case",
    "the photon - hadron interaction is then in many respects similar to hadron - hadron collision .",
    "in addition , it offers the possibility to vary the polarization and virtuality of the photon and thereby manipulate the light cone wave function of the incoming state .",
    "`` the experimentalist can make hadrons of arbitrary sizes . ''    in our approach , we attack the problem as a genuine nonpertubative one .",
    "we use the model of the stochastic vacuum  @xcite which has been adapted to high - energy hadron - hadron scattering in ref .",
    "@xcite , applying the general scheme developped by nachtmann  @xcite for the separation of the large energy scale from the small scale of momentum transfer .",
    "the model of the stochastic vacuum gives satisfactory results both in low and high energy physics .",
    "it yields a rather simple geometrical picture for a single gluonic flux tube  @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism of nonperturbative gluon fluctuations which leads to confinement also generates an interaction of the strings in colliding hadrons . in this picture hadron - hadron scattering",
    "can not be constructed from quark - quark scattering since the string - string interaction plays an important role .",
    "it leads to cross sections which are determined by the transverse extensions of the interacting hadrons .",
    "in addition to the forward scattering amplitudes , the model provides the @xmath4-dependence of the cross section explaining the phenomenologically observed  @xcite correlation between elastic slopes and total cross sections .",
    "soft electroproduction on the nucleon can be calculated along the same lines as hadron - nucleon scattering using a model wave function for the photon . at small @xmath5",
    ", the photon is of hadronic size and large - distance - physics as in hadron - hadron scattering should apply . in another paper  @xcite",
    ", we construct the wave function of the photon as a superposition of vector meson states and calculate the production cross section of @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this approach is limited to virtualities @xmath8gev@xmath9 and the unknown couplings of the electromagnetic current to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 introduce new parameters . in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility to represent the incoming photon as a @xmath10 state . with increasing @xmath5 ,",
    "the transverse extension of the @xmath10 dipole diminishes in a way that depends on the polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "we shall demonstrate how this mechanism shows up phenomenologically .",
    "this allows us to study the transition from large to short - distance - dominated - processes .",
    "the cross section for transversely polarized photons has a large non perturbative part , because endpoints at momentum fraction @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the photon wave function do not select a @xmath10 system of small transverse separation .",
    "therefore our large distance mechanism is important here , too .    in our model the length of the string connecting the valence quarks in the hadron turns out to be very important .",
    "this length depends on the light cone wave function of the hadron .",
    "there is yet little knowledge about the physics determining the light cone hamiltonian in nonperturbative qcd .",
    "so at the moment these wave functions and their integrated distribution amplitudes fulfill mainly a phenomenological task to parametrize the valence quark content of the hadron .",
    "although , the exact value of cross section depends in our model on the detailed form of the wave function , the @xmath5-behavior of specific observables such as ratios of longitudinal to transverse vector meson production or elastic slopes are likely to provide a good test for the string picture inherent in our model .",
    "electroproduction of vector mesons has also been discussed within a soft pomeron framework in ref",
    ".  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "transverse sizes of hadrons only play a marginal role because , on the one hand , hadron scattering can systematically be reduced to quark scattering through the property of quark additivity of the model and , on the other hand , the vector meson wave functions are assumed to be wider than the distance of the quarks in the virtual photon and are thus replaced by their value at the origin .",
    "these assumptions are phenomenologically tenable if one further assumes that the quark - pomeron coupling is flavor dependent . at intermediate @xmath13gev@xmath9  @xcite ,",
    "a pomeron form factor is used for far - off - shell quark legs . at larger values of @xmath5  @xcite ,",
    "nonperturbative two - gluon exchange is applied which leads to color singlet cancellation at small @xmath10-dipole size .    in a series of papers",
    "@xcite , a perturbative two - gluon exchange model extended to include nonperturbative effects via the gluon distribution in the proton has been developped to evaluate vector meson production .",
    "this approach has been further refined to incorporate a bfkl - like evolution to accomodate both energy and @xmath5-dependence .",
    "dipole scattering is the basis of this framework . in the following paper",
    "we are treating the photon and vector meson in a similar way .",
    "the main difference between our approaches lies in the reaction mechanism for soft diffraction .",
    "the importance of the gluon distribution as a necessary part of hard diffraction has been advocated in ref .",
    "these authors have limited the range of applicability of their perturbative calculations to reactions where a large transverse momentum scale rules the exchanges , i.e. to heavy quark production such as @xmath3-production  @xcite or at large @xmath5 ( @xmath14gev@xmath9  @xcite ) .",
    "hera has opened up new possibilities to enlarge the energy and @xmath5 range .",
    "recent zeus and h1 data indicate that at large @xmath5 the cross section may rise more steeply than expected from soft pomeron exchange .",
    "a possible explanation in the language used above  @xcite is that the evolution of the wavefunction at higher energy and @xmath5 gives rise to more and more dipoles inside the hadron .",
    "this evolution would then be a prerequisite to discuss the energy dependence of the virtual photon cross section with increasing resolution .",
