    "knots and links are quite remarkable given that they are as old and ubiquitous as ropes and thread and yet have only relatively recently seen a rigorous formulation within mathematics .",
    "the study of knots and links has enjoyed a close relationship with physics since its inception by gauss @xcite .",
    "today the application of these topological structures in theoretical physics is more widespread than it has ever been , from fault resistant quantum computing @xcite , hadron models @xcite , topological mhd and fluid mechanics @xcite , classical field theories @xcite , quantum field theory @xcite , dna topology @xcite , to nematic liquid crystals @xcite just to name a few . in this article",
    "we shall focus on the application of an important class of knots , torus knots , to classical electromagnetic and gravitational radiation .",
    "a _ hopfion _ is a field configuration based on a topology derived from the hopf fibration .",
    "the electromagnetic hopfion ( em hopfion ) is a null solution to the source free maxwell equations such that any two field lines associated to either the electric , magnetic , or poynting vector fields ( ebs fields ) are closed and linked exactly once @xcite .",
    "when an em hopfion is decomposed onto hyperplanes of constant time there always exists a hyperplane wherein the ebs fields are tangent to the fibers of three orthogonal hopf fibrations .",
    "if one extends the poynting vector to be a future pointing light - like 4-vector its integral curves comprise a space filling shear - free null geodesic congruence dubbed the robinson congruence by roger penrose .",
    "raada @xcite rediscovered the em hopfion solution and noted that its topology was invariant under time evolution .",
    "the search for generalizations of the hopfion solution led to the introduction of a set of non - null em solutions based on torus knots @xcite , but the topology was not preserved during time evolution . around the same time , the kerr - robinson theorem was used to derive the hopfion from the robinson congruence itself using 2-spinor methods @xcite .",
    "inspired by the role of the robinson congruence in the evolution of the hopfion , the conservation of field line topology was tied to the shear - free property of the robinson congruence @xcite .",
    "the fundamental role of the robinson congruence and its connection to the topology of physical systems leads one to consider its relationship to twistor theory .",
    "it has long been known that complex contour integral transforms can be used to find the solution to real pdes . in 1903 , whittaker used this technique to construct the general solution to laplace s equation @xcite . in 1915 , bateman extended this method to give solutions to the vacuum maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "twistor theory was developed by roger penrose in the late 1960 s as an extension of the @xmath1 spinor algebra . from this perspective , the complex analytic structure of bateman can be related to the geometry of spinor fields on space - time @xcite , which encode linear and angular momentum and are represented by two @xmath2 spinors @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the linear momentum is the flagpole of @xmath3 so that @xmath5 and the angular momentum bivector is related to @xmath4 by @xmath6 these spinors are combined into a single object @xmath7 called a twistor . in this formalism , massless linear relativistic fields are expressed in the form of symmetric spinor fields . in 1969 ,",
    "the general solution to the massless spin-@xmath0 field equations was given as a complex contour integral transform now called the penrose transform @xcite .",
    "within the twistor framework the solutions of the massless spin-@xmath0 equations are represented by the penrose transform of homogeneous twistor functions ( see appendix ) .",
    "the elementary states are a canonical example of such functions whose singularities define robinson congruences on minkowski space @xmath8 .",
    "the space - time fields corresponding to the elementary states are finite - energy , and in the null case are everywhere non - singular @xcite . for integer spin fields ,",
    "the expansion of a solution over the elementary states in twistor space @xmath9 is related to the expansion over spherical harmonics in @xmath8 through the penrose transform @xcite .",
    "these properties have made the elementary states the topic of many studies @xcite , and for many problems it is assumed that considering the elementary states is sufficient to describe any solution @xcite .    while investigating these twistor functions and their connection to field topology in @xmath8 , we have previously shown that the em hopfion and the analogous gravitational hopfion are elementary states of twistor theory @xcite . using the earlier construction for em fields by bateman @xcite , kedia ,",

    "have shown that the em hopfion is the simplest case in a set of null em fields based on torus knots @xcite . here",
    "we show that field configurations based on all the torus knots are contained within the elementary states of twistor theory .",
    "the hopf fibration appears as the degenerate case whereby the linked and knotted toroidal structure degenerates down to the linked hopfion configuration .",
    "this generalization leads to a construction for spin-@xmath0 fields based on torus knots .",
    "we will focus our analysis on the spin-1 and spin-2 fields , where the topology is physically manifest in the field lines .",
    "the concept of tendex and vortex lines , gravitational lines of force for a particular observer , was developed by nichols , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who were motivated by the desire to understand the non - linear dynamics of curved space - time in a more intuitive , directly physical way than previous approaches . the physical understanding of the electromagnetic field is based upon the decomposition of the faraday field strength tensor onto hyperplanes of constant time yielding two spacial vector fields interpreted as the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "analogously , the weyl curvature tensor admits a decomposition onto constant time hyperplanes yielding two spacial tensors called the gravito - electric ( ge ) and gravito - magnetic ( gm ) tensors . the integral curves of the eigenvector fields of these tensors are called tendex and vortex lines respectively and represent the gravitational analog of electromagnetic field lines .",
    "this method was elucidated through a series of papers where it was applied to i ) weak field solutions @xcite , ii ) stationary black holes @xcite , and iii ) weak perturbations of stationary black holes @xcite .",
    "this method of gem decomposition is well - suited to studying linked and knotted fields because , as we have shown previously @xcite , the field topology is manifest in the lines of force for both the electromagnetic and analogous gravitational solutions .",
