    "the standing wave produced by the interference among counterpropagating laser beams gives rise to a periodic potential commonly used to fragment and trap clouds of ultracold ( possibly condensed ) alkali atoms @xcite .",

    "the use of multiple wavelength laser beams allows to obtain superlattices , namely more structured periodic potentials characterized by a spatial modulation of the depth of the lattice wells @xcite .    in the case of bosonic atoms cooled to within the lowest bloch band of the periodic potential ,",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the physics of the system is described by the well - known bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite @xmath0\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath1 label the sites of the optical lattice , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates ( annihilates ) a boson at site @xmath4 , @xmath5 counts the bosons at site @xmath4 , and the symbol @xmath6 restricts the sum over @xmath7 to the nearest neighbours of @xmath4 .",
    "this is obtained by a scheme analogous to the tight - binding approximation commonly adopted for the study of electrons in solids , i.e. by expanding the state of the system onto a set of wavefunctions localized at the local minima of the trapping potential .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are hence given in terms of overlap integrals between the localized wavefunctions at neighbouring sites and the trapping potential .",
    "specifically , @xmath8 represents the repulsive boson - boson interaction , @xmath11 is the local potential at site @xmath4 and @xmath12 is the hopping amplitude between sites @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "more in detail , @xmath9 is a global scaling factor determined by the laser intensity , while @xmath13 is a local parameter depending on the details of the optical potential in the region between lattice sites @xmath4 and @xmath7 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : slpotper ] for a schematic representation of the optical superlattices considered in the following ) .",
    "a fine tuning of parameters @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 can be in principle obtained via suitable variations of experimental parameters such as the intensity , the frequency and the geometric setup of the laser beams producing the optical ( super)lattice @xcite . for generic superlattices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are periodic functions of the lattice labels , whereas in the case of the usual single - wavelength optical lattices they are usually assumed to be site - independent , so that one can set @xmath15 and @xmath16 without loss of generality .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 appearing in hamiltonian ( [ e : bh ] ) is the usual chemical potential of the grand canonical statistical approach , and is fixed by the total number of bosons in the system .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ e : bh ] ) is also strictly related to systems other than the one under concern , such as josephson junction arrays and quantum spin systems on lattices @xcite .",
    "the hallmark of such class of systems is no doubt the quantum phase transition between a superfluid and a ( mott ) insulator phase @xcite originating from the competition between the repulsive and kinetic term of the hamiltonian , whose magnitude are proportional to the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the fine tuning of these parameters made possible by the striking progress in optical lattice techniques allowed greiner and co - workers to observe the superfluid - insulator transition in a recent breakthrough experiment @xcite .",
    "more in general , ultracold neutral atoms make an ideal benchmark for testing the properties of widespread models of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling that the above quantum phase transition is rigorously present only at zero temperature @xcite , whereas at finite temperature thermal fluctuations induce a classical phase transition between a superfluid and a normal phase .",
    "however , at sufficiently low temperatures , a remnant of the insulating phase still persists within the normal phase . indeed in these conditions it is possible to observe a sharp crossover between a compressible normal fluid and a phase characterized by a vanishing compressibility , which , for all practical purposes , can be considered a mott insulator @xcite .",
    "the zero - temperature phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model has been widely studied using a variety of techniques , including the mean - field approaches @xcite , strong coupling perturbative expansion @xcite , density matrix renormalization group @xcite and of course quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .    as to the finite - temperature case ,",

    "mean - field approach is adopted , and in ref .",
    ", based on a random phase approximation refining the mean - field approach therein proposed . in ref .",
    "the weak - repulsion limit is addressed , and some results are obtained numerically within a different mean - field scheme , based on the linearization of the repulsive term rather than on the decoupling of the hopping term , like in ref .  .",
    "quite recently , dickerscheid and co - workers @xcite adopted a slave - boson technique allowing to include the finite temperature effects in the mean - field picture of ref .  .",
    "the ongoing interest in the issue under examination is further confirmed by ref .",
    "where a multiband model is addressed  and ref .    where some analytic results are obtained by interpolating two different perturbative schemes and subsequently checked against density matrix renormalization group simulations .",
    "all of the above listed results have been obtained either numerically or applying some further approximation such as introducing tight restrictions on the number of particles per site .",
    "note however that , despite such restrictions , the latter approach may prove sufficient to give satisfactory results within circumscribed regions of the phase diagram .",
    "here we focus on the mean - field approach to hamiltonian ( [ e : bh ] ) proposed by sheshadri _",
    "et al_. @xcite , and , for any temperature @xmath18 , we determine analytically the boundary of the superfluid domain of the phase diagram thereof . in this framework",
    "the phases of the system are characterized in terms of the so - called _ superfluid order parameter _ , to be determined as the stable fixed point of a self - consistency equation .",
    "detailedly , this parameter vanishes in the normal fluid phase , whereas it has a finite value in the superfluid phase .",
    "we determine the critical boundary between these phases by discussing the ( parameter dependent ) stability of the fixed point corresponding to the normal phase .",
    "furthermore we discuss the above - mentioned crossover between the compressible normal fluid and the _ insulator - like _ phase taking place outside the superfluid domain .",
    "other than the usual @xmath19-dimensional homogeneous lattice , we consider a generic one - dimensional @xmath20-periodic superlattice , providing a solution in terms of the maximal eigenvalue of a @xmath21-matrix .",
    "explicit results are given for the the 2-periodic and for a special case of the 3-periodic superlattice , where such maximal eigenvalue can be easily worked out .",
    "the zero - temperature phase - diagram of the above mentioned systems is recovered taking the appropriate limit in our results .",
    "in particular , for superlattices , we find that rational filling lobes appear besides the usual integer - filling mott domains . also , we observe that the occurrence of the latter can be prevented with suitable choices of the supercell potential profile .",
    "all of our results prove equivalent to those obtained adopting the standard numerical algorithm , based on a self - consistent iterative procedure .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ s : mfa ]",
    "we briefly recall the mean - field approach presented in ref .   and introduce the finite - temperature self - consistency condition . in section  [ s : hc ]",
    "we shortly address the homogeneous lattice case , providing the exact expression for the boundary of the superfluid domain , and discussing the crossover between the compressible normal fluid and a insulator - like phase .",

    "such evaluation must be performed self - consistently , since the ground state of @xmath26 itself depends on the set of superfluid parameters @xmath28 . in the particular case of homogeneous lattices ,",
    "translational invariance yields @xmath29 , and one is left with ( @xmath25 identical copies of ) a single - site problem .",

    "the boundaries of these mott lobes have been determined numerically in the original paper @xcite , while their analytical expression has been reported in a quite recent work @xcite .",
