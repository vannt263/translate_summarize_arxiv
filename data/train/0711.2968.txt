    "the physics of helium at low temperatures is among the most intriguing and intensively studied topics in condensed matter science . despite of being a rare gas element with one of the simplest possible electronic structures",
    ", helium constitutes a fundamental system which is challenging for the test and development of methods based on quantum theory . because of its light atomic mass and weak interatomic interaction ,",
    "helium is the only system that remains liquid under its own vapor pressure ( @xmath9 ) at zero temperature . below 2.17 k ,",
    "liquid @xmath0he features superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation , two striking and inherent quantum effects . with an external pressure of @xmath6 25 bar ,",
    "the fluid at @xmath10 crystallizes into the hexagonal closed packet structure ( hcp ) , which remains the stable phase of solid helium at @xmath11 and high pressures , made the exception of an fcc loop along melting in between @xmath12  k.  @xcite    solid helium is manifestly a quantum crystal . in the regime of ultralow temperatures ( few mk )",
    "this system possesses extraordinarily large atomic kinetic energy ( @xmath13 24 k ) and lindemann ratio ( @xmath14 0.26 ) , and likewise anharmonic effects on it are of relevance for predicting and understanding its thermodynamic properties .",
    "@xcite further testimony about the uniqueness of this solid is posed by the long - standing controversy sparked by recent experimental findings about whether perfect crystalline @xmath0he may exhibit superfluid - like behavior and bose - einstein condensation ( supersolid ) .",
    "@xcite from a technological side , solid helium also has some relevance since it is considered as the best quasi - hydrostatic medium hence modern technologies based on it have emerged and induced considerable progress in the field of high - pressure experiments .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study the zero - temperature equation of state of bulk solid @xmath0he in the hcp phase over a wide pressure range ( @xmath1  gpa ) with the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method and the hfd - b(he ) aziz pair potential ( hereafter referred to azizii ) ,  @xcite and additionally with electronic density functional theory ( dft ) to account for many - body interactions arising in the system with increasing pressure . in all the work we differentiate between two pressure regimes , namely low pressure ( @xmath15 gpa ) and high pressure ( @xmath16  gpa ) .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods have proved among the most accurate and reliable tools for solving quantum many - body problems associated to condensed matter systems .",
    "@xcite in particular , the dmc method is a zero - temperature approach which yields exact estimation ( only subject to statistical uncertainty ) of the ground - state energy and related properties of many - boson interacting systems .",
    "@xcite during the last few decades this and other monte carlo techniques ( mainly , the variational monte carlo -vmc- and path integral monte carlo -pimc- methods ) have been fruitfully applied to the study of noble gases and light elements and compounds like he , ne , h , d , lih and lid in homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases and both in bulk and in reduced dimensionalities .  @xcite the great capability of the dmc method is related to the existence of accurate interatomic potentials , which are expressed in the form of many - body expansions , and are tuned to reproduce empirical and/or theoretical data .",
    "interatomic potentials are of precious value because provide computational affordability by allowing one to model atoms as interacting points ( thus avoiding direct treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom of the system ) , and also simplified understanding of the system under study . in the case of helium ,",
    "the semi empirical pair - potential hfd - he2 proposed by aziz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite more than twenty years ago has allowed for quite precise reproduction of the energetic and structural properties of the liquid and solid phases near equilibrium .",
    "@xcite in this work , we use a newer version of this potential , namely the hfd - b(he ) one ,  @xcite which has demonstrated excellent performance in the description of the liquid  @xcite but heretofore has not been tested in the crystal upon high pressure .    anticipating some of the outcomes we are to present ,",
    "excellent agreement between our results for eos and experiments is assessed in the low pressure regime for volumes ranging from @xmath17 @xmath4/mol to @xmath18 @xmath4/mol ; however , discrepancies start to develop at smaller volumes ( @xmath19 gpa ) . within the low pressure regime ,",
    "we provide exact estimation within some statistical error of the kinetic energy per atom , lindemann ratio and debye temperature of the system by means of the pure estimator technique .",
    "@xcite in the high pressure regime , however , our equation of state systematic and increasingly overestimates the pressure .",
    "discrepancies with respect to measurements amount to @xmath20 at @xmath21 gpa and to @xmath22 at @xmath23 gpa .",
    "previous pimc work on the eos of solid @xmath0he at ambient temperature ( @xmath24 k ) and performed with akin model pair potentials arrived to similar disagreements .",
    "@xcite with the aim of analyzing the possible causes of this large disagreement we first examine the influence of finite size effects in our results .",
    "indeed , finite size effects become larger by increasing pressure because cut - off distances involved in the calculation of the atomic interactions within the system are continously reduced ( generally these are chosen as half the length of the simulation box ) . accordingly , the radial pair distribution function for crystals , @xmath25 , emerges progressively less smooth with compression . therefore , customary corrections devised for dealing with finite size effects which are based on simple approximations for @xmath25 , might introduce appreciable deviations in the results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gr ] ) .",
    "because of these effects , we have regarded as essential to quote the energy tails accounting for the finite size corrections by means of two different approaches : ( i ) considering @xmath26 beyond a certain cut - off distance and then integrating the simplified analytic expressions for the tails , and ( ii ) , computing the variational monte carlo energy of progressively enlarged systems and then estimating the energy of the corresponding infinite system by means of extrapolation to @xmath27 .",
    "certainly , approach ( ii ) results computationally more demanding than ( i ) but also more accurate , and we find a pressure difference of @xmath28 gpa between both resulting eoss at the smallest studied volume ( @xmath29 @xmath4/mol ) .",
    "nevertheless , this discrepancy by itself does not explain the large disagreement between our results and high - pressure data . in consequence",
    ", we turn our main concern to the characterization of the interatomic interactions .",
    "it is well - known that the structural and electronic properties of the atomic and molecular systems may experience important arrangements by effect of pressure .",
    "@xcite upon compression , overlappings between the electronic clouds within the system are promoted hence further correlations among the atoms ( angular forces ) emerge so as to lower their energies . in the case of solid @xmath0he , it has been suggested and tested within the self consistent phonon formalism that three - body exchange interactions become significant with increasing density .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", chang and boninsegni included three - body effects into their high - pressure pimc calculations performed with pair potentials , by computing the energy of several three - body interaction models over sets of configurations generated in their simulations ( that is , perturbatively ) . in doing this",
    ", their agreement with experiments did not improve quantitatively , thus they suggested that higher order many - body contributions to the energy had to be considered .",
    "more recently , herrero  @xcite has adopted a similar but computationally more demanding approach to that of chang and boninsegni in which three - body interactions are explicitly included into the model hamiltonian . for the case of a rescaled bruch - mcgee three - body interaction ,",
    "herrero s work provides very notable agreement with experiments up to pressures of @xmath30 gpa and at room temperature .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a perturbative approach for quoting the many - body interactions happening within highly compressed solid @xmath0he which are not accounted for by any atomic pair potential , and without increasing the computational cost significantly . essentially , this consists in performing _",
    "ab initio _ density functional calculations over sets of atomic configurations independently drawn from dmc simulations ; subsequently , the energies previously computed with dmc are corrected according to the average difference between the _ ab initio _ interaction energy of the all - electron - ion system and the pair - potential energy . in this way , many - body interactions of order two and higher are included perturbatively into the eos without requiring from the knowledge of any additional two- , three- , four- , and so on , body interatomic potential .",
    "we show that proceeding in this manner the agreement with high pressure experimental data is at the @xmath31 level with relatively few computational extra cost .",
    "truly , the approach that here we present for helium can be extended to the study of other quantum crystals upon high pressure for which accurate pair potentials are available .",
    "the remainder of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] describes the methods that we have employed , the treatment of finite size effects and gives the technical details . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our results for the ground state of solid @xmath32he at low and high pressure and yield further comparison with first - principles based calculations . finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] we analyze the pros and cons of the proposed perturbative scheme and conclude with the final remarks .",
    "he at different molar volumes as computed with dmc .",
    "curves are terminated at half the length of the simulation box ( containing 180 particles in each case ) . ]",
    "dmc is a ground - state method which provides the exact energy within statistical errors of many - boson interacting systems of interest .",
    "@xcite this technique is based on a short - time approximation for the green s function corresponding to the imaginary time - dependent schr@xmath33dinger equation , which is solved up to a certain order of accuracy within an infinitesimal interval @xmath34 . despite this method",
    "is algorithmically simpler than domain green s function monte carlo ,  @xcite it presents some @xmath35 bias coming from the factorization of the imaginary time propagator @xmath36 .",
    "our implementation of dmc is quadratic ,  @xcite hence the control of the time - step bias is efficiently controlled since the required @xmath37 extrapolation is nearly eliminated by choosing a sufficiently small time step .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath38 , describing our system is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of a @xmath32he atom , @xmath41 the distance between atoms composing an @xmath42,@xmath43 pair and @xmath44 the hfd - b(he ) aziz interaction .",
    "@xcite the corresponding schr@xmath33dinger equation in imaginary time ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 with @xmath47 an arbitrary constant , can be formally solved by expanding the solution @xmath48 in the basis set of the energy eigenfunctions @xmath49 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath48 tends to the ground state wave function @xmath50 of the system for an infinite imaginary time as well as the expected value of the hamiltonian tends to the ground - state value @xmath51 .",
    "the hermiticity of the hamiltonian guarantees the equality @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a convenient trial wave function which depends on the atomic coordinates of the system @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , the ground - state energy of the system can be computed by calculating the integral @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( assuming it is normalized ) , and @xmath57 is the local energy defined as @xmath58 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath59 in @xmath60 is known as importance sampling and it certainly improves the way in which integral ( [ eq : integral ] ) is computed ( for instance , by imposing @xmath61 when @xmath41 is smaller than the core distance of the interatomic interaction ) .    in this work , the trial wave function adopted for importance sampling corresponds to the extensively tested nosanow - jastrow model  @xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are variational parameters .",
    "this model is composed of two - body correlation functions @xmath67 accounting for the two - body correlations induced by @xmath68 , and one - body functions @xmath69 which localize each particle around a site of the equilibrium lattice of the crystal as given by the set of vectors @xmath70 .",
    "initially , the parameters contained in @xmath71 are optimized by means of variational monte carlo at some molar volume near equilibrium ; however , as we have explored the system over a wide range of volumes we have repeated this procedure at some other selected points along the eos .",
    "for instance , the optimized value of the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the molar volume @xmath72  @xmath4 is @xmath73 and @xmath74  @xmath75 , respectively , while at @xmath76  @xmath4 results @xmath77 and @xmath78  @xmath75  .",
    "the parameters of the simulations , namely , the number of particles , @xmath79 , critical population of walkers , @xmath80 , and time step , @xmath81 , have been adjusted to eliminate any residual bias coming from them ; their respective values are 180 , 400 and 2.7@xmath8210@xmath83 k@xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath81 has been reduced progressively with increasing density in order to provide numerical stability .",
    "the description of an infinite system of interacting particles is obtained in practice through the simulation of a finite number of particles enclosed within a box .",
    "the difference between the scale of the real and simulated systems can be overcome by enlarging the size of the simulated system so much as possible and applying periodic boundary conditions to it .",
    "@xcite even so , several corrections to the energies quoted directly from the simulation must be done if correlations of longer range are present .",
    "certainly , these corrections arise from the fact that the maximum distance involving correlations in the simulation coincides with the length - scale of the particle container .",
    "the expressions for the potential and kinetic energy corrections @xmath85 and @xmath86 , assuming a certain cut - off length r@xmath87 for the computation of the correlations ( generally chosen as half the length of the simulation box ) , are  : @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath79 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the number , diffusion constant and density of particles , and @xmath25 , @xmath68 and @xmath92 the radial pair distribution function , pair potential and two - body correlation function entering the trial wave function , respectively . in the case of liquids , @xmath25 can be well - approximated to unity in equations ( [ eq : epotcorrhe ] ) and ( [ eq : ekincorrhe ] ) , and consequently , @xmath85 and @xmath86 turn out to be analytically accessible ( standard tail correction -stc- ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of solids such approximation could result rather inaccurate owing that the pattern of the radial distribution function is still oscillating beyond the cut - off distance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gr ] ) . in view of these facts and in order for the attained description of solid @xmath0he to be as precise as possible ,",
    "we have estimated @xmath85 and @xmath86 also by means of vmc ( variational tail correction -vtc- ) through the relation @xmath93 where the superscripts in the energies refer to number of particles , @xmath79 is the number of particles used in the dmc simulations and @xmath94 .",
    "the limit @xmath27 , equivalent to @xmath95 in equations ( [ eq : epotcorrhe ] ) and ( [ eq : ekincorrhe ] ) , is reached through successive enlargements of the simulation box at fixed density ( up to 900 particles ) and further linear extrapolation to infinite volume .",
    "indeed , this procedure results computationally affordable within vmc but not within dmc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fscorr ] , we shown the asymptotic agreement between standard and variational energy tail corrections for infinite solid @xmath0he ( @xmath96 ) within vmc .",

    "filled circles correspond to total energy assuming stc energy tail corrections while the empty ones correspond to the total energy deduced directly from the simulation ; both respective linear fits are coincident in the limit @xmath27 ]      density functional theory ( dft ) is a first - principles quantum approach which has allowed for accurate and reliable knowledge of a great deal of materials and systems with exceptional computational affordability .",
    "a comprehensive description of dft methods as applied to the modeling of condensed matter is given in recent books and reviews .",
    "@xcite in dft , the _ ab initio _ free energy of an atomic system , given the positions and charges of its nuclei , is expressed as a functional of the electronic density , @xmath100 , as follows : @xmath101 = t[n({\\bf r } ) ] + \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\int\\frac{n\\left({\\bf r}\\right)n\\left(\\bf { r'}\\right)}{\\mid { \\bf r}-{\\bf r'}\\mid}d{\\bf r}d{\\bf r ' } + \\sum_{i}^{n } z_{i } \\int\\frac{n\\left({\\bf r } \\right)}{\\mid { \\bf r_{i}}-{\\bf r } \\mid } d{\\bf r } +   \\nonumber \\\\ e_{xc}[n({\\bf r } ) ] + \\sum_{i < j}^{n } \\frac{z_{i}z_{j}}{\\mid { \\bf r_{i}}-{\\bf r_{j } } \\mid }   ,   \\label{eq : dftfunct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 $ ] is the electronic kinetic energy , @xmath103 and @xmath104 the atomic number and position of atom @xmath105 , respectively , and @xmath106 $ ] the electronic exchange - correlation energy ( we have imposed @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xmath109 ) .",
    "the other terms in eq.([eq : dftfunct ] ) account for the coulomb interactions between electrons , electrons and nuclei and nuclei .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem states that the density @xmath110 which minimizes the functional @xmath111 $ ] corresponds to the true ground - state density of the system ( thus @xmath112 $ ] ) and that this optimal solution is unique .",
    "it is demonstrated that dft is an exact electronic ground - state method , whereas the electronic exchange - correlation functional is not known for most of the systems .",
    "consequently , some approximations for it must be introduced in the calculations .",
    "the most widely used models for @xmath113 are the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , which have been parameterized by different groups . in this work ,",
    "we use both ceperley - alder ( ca ) version of lda  @xcite and perdew - wang ( pw91 ) of gga ,  @xcite since _ a priori _ one can not discern confidently which is going to result more reliable for the study . a completely independent issue from the choice of @xmath113 is the implementation of dft that is used .",
    "this mainly concerns the way in which the electron orbitals are represented .",
    "here , we use the projector augmented wave ( paw ) framework developed by bl@xmath33ch  @xcite and as implemented in the vasp program .",
    "@xcite    the perturbative approach that we propose for correcting the dmc energies obtained with the pair potential @xmath114 , consists in averaging the quantity @xmath115 over sets of configurations drawn independently from the dmc simulations .",
    "according to this , the corrected energies result @xmath116 the many - body correction @xmath117 includes two- , three- and so on many - body contributions to the total energy as can be seen by invoking a many - body expansion of the _ ab initio _ ground state energy @xmath118",
    "we note that the family of vectors @xmath119 here refer to the positions of the atoms ( nuclei ) and not to the sites of the perfect crystalline lattice .",
    "it turns out that all the many - body terms composing @xmath120 are evaluated for any arrangament of the atoms as generated according to the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) , and included into the total energy in a perturbative manner .",
    "certainly , our many - body approach is not exact ; firstly , it is noted that the full quantum hamiltonian of the system expressed within the born - oppenheimer approximation ( fq - bo ) might be written down as @xmath121 , where @xmath122 corresponds to the kinetic energy of the nuclei , and that eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) results a simplification of it , needless to be said , extremely accurate at low and moderate pressures .",
    "nevertheless , using the dmc method for solving the ground - state of @xmath123 remains a future goal because of the numerous intricacies encountered in the treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom ( i.e. choice of the trial wavefunction and sign problem ) and large computational cost involved .",
    "therefore , instead of abording the full quantum problem straightaway , we have opted for a simplified but affordable strategy : add and substract @xmath114 into @xmath123 , solve exactly the part of the hamiltonian embodying most of the two - body interactions and account for the rest by means of first - order perturbation theory .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations required for the computation of @xmath117 have been performed on supercells containing 180 particles and with @xmath124 monkhorst - pack @xmath125-sampling of the brillouin zone  @xcite and cut - off energy 478.0 ev ; these settings ensure energy convergence to better than 0.5 k per atom . on the other side ,",
    "our criterion for the convergence of correction @xmath117 relies on the measure of its fluctuation , @xmath126 , over the same collection of dmc configurations than used for the average @xmath127 .",
    "given a molar volume , we have requested @xmath128 to be less than 1 k per atom , that is approximately @xmath129 the total dmc energy obtained at large densities . in the process of drawing atomic configurations from the dmc runs ,",
    "we have imposed the only constraint @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the local energy of the considered configuration and @xmath132 the mean energy calculated over the population of walkers to which it corresponds .",
    "we have proceeded so for avoiding spurious configurations on the averages which otherwise are rejected within few steps in the dmc sampling .",
    "the number of atomic configurations required for the convergence of @xmath117 has proved smaller than initially expected in all the studied cases : about 15 - 25 were enough .",
    "this rapid convergence of the fluctuations @xmath133 reveals that despite two - body interactions by themselves are not sufficient to attain reliable description of very dense solid @xmath0he they are still of leading relevance on it .",
    "the eoss of solid @xmath32he has been obtained by fitting a fourth - order polynomial to the dmc energies and subsequently performing the derivation respect to volume , @xmath134 where @xmath135 is directly the equilibrium volume of the system and @xmath65 , @xmath66 constants . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyeq ] , we compare the dmc energies at volumes close to equilibrium ( @xmath136 ) , obtained with both stc and vtc , with experimental data .",
    "@xcite as one observes there , excellent agreement between measurements and vtc results is provided , however , differences with respect to stc results are quoted in an almost constant upwards shift of @xmath137 k at positive pressure . despite these discrepancies will practically vanish when expliciting both vtc and stc eoss because of the energy derivative involved ( as it will be shown shortly ) , it is noted that for other magnitudes which explicitly depend on the internal energy , as for example the enthalpy or freezing and melting densities , vtc and stc lead to different results . in the same figure",
    ", we also display previous theoretical calculations performed with green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) and the hfd - he2 aziz pair potential .",
    "@xcite the gfmc points perfectly coincide with our results obtained with vtc , however , they disagree with the stc ones in the same manner experimental points do",
    ". since gfmc and dmc are exact ground - state methods , energy differences between both approaches should be due only to the model interaction .",

    "on the other side , the estimation of @xmath204 requires from some knowledge of the phonon - related properties of the solid of interest . in the case of heavy - ion crystals , the quasiharmonic approximation in combination with finite displacement methods",
    "have allowed for an accurate description of the phonon frequency spectra .",
    "@xcite the basic strategy underlying these methods consists in distorting the perfect crystal by displacing certain selected atoms slightly from their equilibrium positions and then evaluating the atomic forces arising on the system by means of the hellman - feynman theorem and dft .",
    "this approach , however , fails to reproduce solid @xmath0he since it provides negative ( imaginary ) phonon frequencies associated to its experimental stable phases at intermediate pressures .",
    "@xcite truly , the relevance of anharmonic effects in solid @xmath0he makes the computation of its vibrational properties a tedious and complicate task which requires from approaches going beyond the harmonic and/or quasiharmonic approximations .",
    "it should be noted that within dmc this difficulty is circumvented since the phononic nature of the studied system is inherently cast into the method , hence further partition of the energy into static and vibrational parts is not required .    in order to contrast our results presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : highpress ] with other obtained with _ ab initio _ based methods , we have computed the eos of solid @xmath0he through the relation ( [ eq : dftener ] ) by evaluating @xmath205 with dft and @xmath206 with the mie - gruneisen model  @xcite @xmath207 where @xmath176 is the debye temperature , @xmath208 the gruneisen parameter which we approximate as @xmath209 ( with @xmath210 ) and @xmath211 the gas constant .",
    "indeed , we have used for @xmath212 the experimental relation provided by driessen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite since , as we have noted previously , the estimation of this or any other vibrational property of solid @xmath0he at @xmath10 would result not trusty with customary _ ab initio _",
    "strategies used in the study of normal ( not quantum ) solids .",
    "the resulting @xmath206 increases monotonically with compression and for instance it represents about @xmath213 of the total pressure of the system at volume @xmath214 @xmath4/mol , thus it must not be neglected . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dftcomp ] , we show the eoss obtained with the already explained procedure using both lda and gga approximations for the exchange - correlation energy ; also we include the @xmath138 curves quoted within dmc and corrected for the vdw energy and many - body interactions , and experimental data . as it is observed there , differences between both lda and gga perturbationally corrected curves and their _ ab initio _ counterparts are quite small .",
    "moreover , these discrepancies are likely caused by the treatment of the long range interactions ( vdw energy ) described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : highpress ] and the approximation adopted for @xmath206 .",
    "this result is stimulating since it demonstrates that with the approach presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : dft ] one can obtain accurate eoss for dense solid helium , or equivalently for any other light quantum solid , in excellent agreement with those which would be obtained by means of first - principles approaches but with the benefit of not requiring from the computation of the phonon dispersion curves of the crystal or experimental data .",
    "now we turn our attention to the concern posed over lda in the previous subsection . as we noted there , a glance at table ii might lead to the conclusion that the lda corrections are too large so as to be considered perturbative on top of the dmc energies ( not so the gga ones ) .",
    "indeed , we do not dispose of a fair criterion for accepting or rejecting corrections in basis to their size , and in our opinion this is the most important shortcoming of our approach .",
    "nevertheless , appealing to the good accordance between the lda @xmath138 curve corrected for the atomic zero - point motion and the dmc one corrected with lda , we may feel quite confident about the reliability of the latter .",
    "in the introduction we pointed out that diffusion monte carlo is among the best suited methods for studying quantum solids . in the case of bosonic systems , this method provides the exact ground state energy and related properties without dependence on the choice of the trial wave function , which otherwise is related to the computational efficiency . here",
    ", we have proved the excellent performance of dmc with the aziz pair potential hfd - b(he ) in characterizing solid @xmath0he at low pressures ( @xmath215 0.65 gpa ) , by estimating its eos , kinetic energy per particle and debye temperature at different volumes , and comparing our results with experiments .",
    "especial attention has been paid to the extend of finite size effects in our results . to this regard ,",
    "we conclude that customary strategies devised to correct such effects based on the approximation of the pair radial distribution function to unity beyond certain cut - off distance , may result accurate enough for the derivation of the eos but not so for the assessment of other magnitudes like the energy .    on the other side , solid helium under high compression ( as most of the materials ) undergoes important arrangements on electronic structure which lead to the appearance of angular correlations among the atoms .",
    "@xcite this circumstance makes necessary to consider not only atomic pair interactions but also higher order many - body ones when investigating this crystal upon high pressure . nevertheless ,",
    "within dmc the minimal inclusion of three - body interactions on the model hamiltonian has already the effect of drastically slow down the simulations .",
    "furthermore , even in the supposed case computational cost was not a problem , first we should know much better than now the analytical form of these many - body interactions or alternatively to be able to devise them ( which actually may result puzzling ) . according to this occurrence , _ ab initio _ methods emerge among the best candidates for quoting such contributions since they do not rely on potential models and , in general , are computationally affordable .",
    "however , fully _ ab initio _ analysis of crystals requires from the knowledge of the phonon - related properties , and for the case of solid @xmath0he and other light quantum solids this is by no means a straightforward task .    in this work ,",
    "we have presented an approach for the study of dense solid @xmath0he at zero temperature which combines the versatility of the dmc method with the accuracy of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "on one hand , we naturally circumvent the calculation of the vibrational properties of helium thanks to the dmc strategy , and on the other , we account for the many - body interactions having place on the system by means of dft . however , the way by which we enclose these many - body contributions to the dmc energy is not exact but perturbative and we do not dispose of rigorous tests for quoting the errors included on these corrections .",
    "concerning results , we have yielded the eoss corrected in this manner within lda and gga for the exchange - correlation energy and they have proved in fairly notable agreement with experiments over the pressure range @xmath216 gpa . specifically , gga provides a better description of the crystal near equilibrium than lda .",
    "further comparison of these curves with eoss obtained trough dft and corrected for the atomic zero - point motion by means of an approximate model , comes to support the reliability of our approach",
    ".    it should be mentioned that the zero - temperature scheme proposed in this work is also well suited for the study of other light quantum solids upon high pressure , like @xmath217he , h@xmath170 , d@xmath170 and li , for which accurate pair potentials are devised .",
    "certainly , a further and promising improvement of the present framework would consist in going beyond the perturbative approach .",
    "this could be achieved by proper coupling of the dmc and dft methods , as for instance , by considering the _ ab initio _ energy of the system within the branching weight of the dmc algorithm .",
    "work on this direction is in progress .",
