    "recently , quantum simulators built upon ultracold atomic gases @xcite have been designed in order to explore the very interesting interplay between quantum mechanics and curved space - time @xcite , including the effects of dimensionality @xcite or unusual topology @xcite . moreover , a detailed proposal for a quantum simulator to explore unruh physics in cold atoms has been put forward @xcite .",
    "the idea behind all the proposed quantum simulators on curved space - times @xcite is the following : a static metric with an inhomogeneous time - lapse function @xmath0 for fermionic systems can be simulated by tuning the local hopping amplitudes between the cells of an optical lattice .",
    "this relation can be also understood in reverse : an inhomogeneity in the hopping amplitudes may be read as a non - trivial space - time metric .",
    "this idea has sparked interest in the low energy states of these inhomogeneous spin chains and fermionic hopping models , which can be understood as dynamics on a curved metric .",
    "for example , it has been shown how a modulation of the metric can give rise to ground states ( gs ) which present extremely long - range correlations , such as the _ rainbow state _ @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the gs of local quantum systems usually follows the _ area law _",
    "@xcite , but in a curved metric we can have a strong violation , with a volumetric growth of the block entropies .",
    "this led to a thermal interpretation of the rainbow state @xcite , which can be viewed as a thermo - field double .",
    "thus we see that , in some situations , it makes sense to attach a non - zero temperature to a quantum ground state .",
    "one of the most surprising results in thermodynamics on curved space - times was stated by richard tolman and paul ehrenfest in 1930 @xcite : the temperature of an equilibrium system in a static space - time may vary from point to point , and it is inversely proportional to the local lapse function ,    @xmath1    the result is of thermodynamical nature , and can be proved without any assumptions on the dynamics @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to the study of the _ unruh effect _ : an accelerated observer traveling through a minkowski vacuum must feel a thermal bath of particles at a temperature proportional to its acceleration @xcite . due to the principle of equivalence",
    ", such an observer can be considered to be at rest in _ rindler space - time _ , which is characterized by a lapse function which increases linearly with the distance to an _ horizon _ , @xmath2 .",
    "then , the tolman - ehrenfest theorem predicts that the local temperature must decay as the inverse of that same distance , @xmath3 .",
    "it is relevant to notice that the unruh effect is defined in an operational way @xcite : an _ unruh - dewitt _ detector is defined as a simple quantum system with a local monopolar interaction with the field .",
    "the temperature will manifest itself in the quantum fluctuations within the detector @xcite .    a great amount of theoretical work has been devoted to the _ locality - of - temperature _ problem , i.e. , to find under which conditions a subsystem of a global system at temperature @xmath4 can be considered to be again in a thermal state at the same temperature @xcite . in general terms",
    ", the answer is that this is possible when a certain measure of the energy contained in the correlations is lower than the physical temperature , @xmath4 .",
    "thus , this work will explore the opposite limit , when @xmath5 , so quantum correlations can create non - trivial local thermal effects .",
    "thus , one may ask how small a thermometer can be in order to make sensible measurements .",
    "quantum thermometry is indeed an area undergoing a rapid growth .",
    "the idea of using a single qubit as a thermometer has been put forward recently by several groups @xcite . in this case , the fluctuations in the temperature estimate should be taken into account @xcite , which are expected to follow the landau relation , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the heat capacity of the system .",
    "this work proposes to explore local quantum thermometry on the ground state of inhomogeneous free fermionic hamiltonians by observing the quantum fluctuations of a single - qubit unruh - dewitt detector , locally linked to our system .",
    "the long term average of the occupation provides an estimate of the local temperature , while its frequency dependence provides further information about the system .",
    "we explore the relation between the local temperature estimate and the time - lapse , showing that they are related via a modification of the tolman - ehrenfest relation .",
    "the reason to use free systems is that we will focus on the interplay between geometry and thermal effects , and we leave the effects of interaction for further work .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe our physical model , an unruh - dewitt detector locally attached to the ground state of a fermionic system on a curved background .",
    "the methodological issues are discussed in section [ sec : calc ] , and the numerical results are shown in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "section [ sec : sqd ] is devoted to a variational general study of the physics of single - qubit detectors in interaction with free fermionic systems .",
    "this article ends in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a summary of the conclusions and suggestions for further work .",
    "let us consider a system of spinless fermions on @xmath8 sites characterized by a hamiltonian @xmath9 , and let @xmath10 denote the creation operator at site @xmath11 .",
    "we introduce a new site , the unruh - dewitt detector or thermometer , with label 0 and a chemical potential @xmath12 , whose hamiltonian is :    @xmath13    let @xmath14 , and let us cool the system into its ground state , which will contain @xmath15 fermions ( half - filling ) in the system while the detector will be empty .",
    "we now quench the system by attaching the detector to site @xmath16 of the system via an interaction term of the form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a ( small ) coupling constant .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is now given by    @xmath19    see fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] for an illustration .",
    "if the detector is in the extreme , the system presents some similarity to a kondo lattice , but it remains a pure hopping hamiltonian , non - interacting .",
    "after the quench , we observe that the expected value of the occupation of the detector is a function of time , @xmath20 , and we can define @xmath21 to be its long - term time average ,    @xmath22    if this limit exits . since the energy difference between the empty and the occupied states of the detector is @xmath23 , which we assume to be sufficiently above than the fermi energy of the system , we can give a thermal interpretation to that magnitude :    @xmath24    from which we can infer a local temperature @xmath25 , associated to site @xmath16 . if the energy provided by the coupling , @xmath26 , is small , we can assume that we are not perturbing the system noticeably and , therefore , we are measuring an intrinsic property of the quantum system .",
    "notice that this procedure bears a strong similarity to the operational definition of the unruh temperature @xcite , the main difference being that our detector is at rest .",
    "for concreteness , let us consider our system to be a 1d free fermion lattice with @xmath8 sites and a position - dependent hopping amplitude :    @xmath27    where the @xmath28 are the hopping amplitudes , encoding the geometry .",
    "if they are slowly varying , they can be understood as a local time - lapse function @xmath0 of a static metric @xcite :    @xmath29    where we assume @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we can also think of @xmath32 as a local speed of light in an optical metric .",
    "notice that the restriction to a 1d non - interacting system is only made for convenience .",
    "let us compute the local temperature defined by eq . . before the quench",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath33 , and after the quench it is @xmath34 .",
    "both hamiltonians are free , thus their eigenstates can be obtained in terms of single - body energies and orbitals :    @xmath35    the linear transformations among the single - body orbitals @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath10 are all unitary . furthermore , we define    @xmath38    the initial state is the ground state of @xmath39 :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the set of occupied levels in the initial system , i.e. : those whose energy @xmath42 ( we will assume it to be non - degenerate , so there are no zero modes ) .",
    "let us express the time evolution in the heisenberg image , making the operators evolve .",
    "thus , we need to obtain    @xmath43    the orbitals of @xmath44 evolve as @xmath45 , where @xmath46",
    ". the evolution of the on - site @xmath47 operators is given by :    @xmath48    putting all together we obtain    @xmath49    from here we read that the fourier transform of the temporal fluctuations of the detector occupation , @xmath50 , has peaks at frequencies @xmath51 :    @xmath52    with weights given by the expression :    @xmath53    assuming that the @xmath54 are all different , we can read the expression for the long - term average of the expectation value of the occupation , , as the zero - frequency component :    @xmath55    for a finite system , expression always makes sense and converges to the long term average of the occupation as long as there are no degeneracies in the single - particle spectrum of @xmath44 , @xmath56 .",
    "a relevant question in practice is what does _ long term _",
    "mean exactly .",
    "the answer is : long enough for all non - zero frequencies in expression to average out , which will require a time inversely proportional to the slowest non - zero value of @xmath57 .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations in order to explore the relation between the local temperature , the thermometer occupation and the local properties of the state . in all cases , unless otherwise specified , we choose the thermometer chemical potential @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rindler_quench ] we show the time evolution of the expected value of the occupation of the thermometer @xmath20 when it is attached to different sites of a @xmath60 fermionic rindler - like chain with couplings of the form @xmath61 ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and open boundaries .",
    "notice that the different values of the long - time average are easy to spot from the beginning , and rather marked .",
    "the periodic bursts are related to the time taken by the perturbation created by the quench to bounce back at the boundaries and return .",
    "[ fig : tempsite ] shows the inverse of the long term average of the occupation of the thermometer when attached at different sites , @xmath64 , obtained using eq .",
    ", for different background geometries , which we will describe from top to bottom .",
    "( a ) a constant hopping term , @xmath65 , both with open and periodic boundary conditions ( obc and pbc ) for a system with @xmath60 . for pbc , the occupation is homogeneous due to the translation invariance . for obc ,",
    "the average value of @xmath66 is the same as for pbc , but we observe large fluctuations due to the boundaries .",
    "( b ) rindler chain ,    @xmath67    with fixed @xmath68 and open boundaries .",
    "the left extreme of the system , @xmath69 , behaves similarly to an horizon .",
    "we use also @xmath60 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and @xmath59 and @xmath72 . in this case , the result is more surprising : we observe that @xmath73 , in similarity to the growth of the hopping term .",
    "thus , we can assert our main conjecture :    @xmath74    where the constant will depend on the properties of the thermometer , @xmath18 and @xmath23 .",
    "this expression , nonetheless , is only approximate .",
    "moreover , the local occupation of the thermometer presents strong parity oscillations .",
    "( c ) rainbow chain ,    @xmath75    with @xmath76 $ ] , i.e. , the hoppings fall exponentially from the center .",
    "the ground state of this system presents volumetric growth of the entanglement @xcite , and can be interpreted as a thermo - field state . in this case , using @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we also observe the conjectured form to hold approximately . in this case , no parity oscillations appear , but we can see that the occupation saturates when we move away from the center .",
    "( d ) sinusoidal chain ,    @xmath80    which we explore for @xmath60 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the first case follows our conjectured form very accurately .",
    "the second , @xmath83 presents an horizon at @xmath84 , and around its neighborhood our conjecture is less accurate .",
    "( -7.5,15.5)(a ) ( -7.5,12.5)(b ) ( -7.5,8.5)(c ) ( -7.5,4.5)(d )    assuming @xmath85 const .",
    "we can also conjecture that the local temperature @xmath86 will behave like    @xmath87    and this expression is tested in fig .",
    "[ fig : temphop ] , which shows the local hopping in the horizontal axis , in logarithmic scale , and @xmath88 in the vertical one , for most of the systems used in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempsite ] . in all cases ,",
    "the dependence between @xmath89 and @xmath90 is shown to be approximately logarithmic , although the prefactor can differ : for the rindler and rainbow systems away from saturation , the behavior is approximately @xmath91 . on the other hand , for the sine system away from the horizon",
    "the behavior is @xmath92 .",
    "the fluctuations in the thermometer occupation can be analysed beyond their long - term average value .",
    "the full spectral decomposition of @xmath20 can be studied using eq . .",
    "fig : spectrum ] we show the frequency decomposition of the quantum noise on the thermometer , @xmath93 for a rindler system with @xmath94 and @xmath60 , @xmath59 and @xmath58 , when the unruh - dewitt detector is placed at different sites .",
    "notice that the central peak , which corresponds to the long - term average @xmath21 , is relatively isolated .",
    "the active frequencies correspond to a block which gets broader as we move away from the horizon .    for comparison , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the same spectral decomposition @xmath93 for the quantum noise of the detector at any point of a homogeneous system .",
    "the shape is rather similar to the response functions for rindler space : the isolated central peak plus the continuous block of frequencies .",
    "let us discuss how the the single - body spectrum of a free fermionic system changes when a new site is attached to site @xmath16 , as shown in eq .",
    ", which we will call a _ single qubit detector _ ( sqd ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] for an illustration .",
    "let the unperturbed system be characterized by a set of single - body orbitals @xmath95 , with energies @xmath96 .",
    "a simple yet very accurate study can be done using a two - level variational approach , in which each deformed single - body state is obtained minimizing the energy within the subspace spanned by the original orbital and the state localized in the new site . for each",
    "unperturbed orbital , @xmath97 , we propose an ansatz of this form :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 denote the states in which mode @xmath97 is either empty or occupied , and the same reads for @xmath100 and the detector .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of this two - level system can be written as :    @xmath101    notice that only @xmath102 is relevant in this approach .",
    "the energy shift for the orbital will be given by    @xmath103    notice that the expression presents a pole at @xmath104 , although we will stay safe : @xmath23 is always chosen to be sufficiently above the fermi energy , which is zero in our case . correspondingly , the probability of finding the fermion in the new site is now    @xmath105    the astonishing validity of this approximation can be seen in fig . [",
    "fig : sprout ] , where we compare the exact and the two - level variational results with the exact calculation .    returning to expression",
    "we can state that @xmath106 and , approximately , @xmath107 , thus obtaining    @xmath108    notice that the local occupation ( and , therefore , the local temperature ) is related to the form of the orbitals and the _ energy content _ at the site to which the detector is attached .",
    "the long - term average occupation always depends quadratically with the coupling constant , @xmath109 , for low enough @xmath18 .",
    "thus , if @xmath18 is small enough , we expect @xmath21 to be small too , although it is conceivable to reach a regime where @xmath110 , i.e. : population inversion or negative absolute temperatures .",
    "in this work we have presented an operational definition of the local temperature of a quantum system , via the interaction with a single qubit unruh - dewitt detector characterized as a two - level system with a ( large enough ) energy gap @xmath23 and a ( small enough ) coupling constant @xmath18 .",
    "the main observable is the long - term average occupation of the detector , which is shown to depend quadratically with @xmath18 and have a mild dependence on @xmath23 if it is sufficiently above the fermi energy .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the detector occupation and the associated local temperature on the ground state of free fermionic systems in 1d with inhomogeneous hopping parameters @xmath32 , which can be understood as the time - lapse , @xmath111 , of a background static geometry ( or local speed of light ) . in all cases",
    "we have found an approximate inverse proportionality between the long - term average occupation of the detector and the time - lapse , @xmath112 thus , the local temperature is always higher where the local time - lapse is lower .",
    "more specifically , the local inverse temperature grows linearly with the logarithm of the time - lapse .",
    "this result bears a strong similarity to the tolman - ehrenfest theorem of thermodynamics on curved spacetimes , which states that the local inverse temperature should behave as the local time - lapse , although they differ . nonetheless , our result is purely quantum , since we are operating on ground states , i.e. , at zero global temperature .",
    "our main conjecture , @xmath113 , seems to remain approximately valid for a wide variety of inhomogeneities : linear ( rindler ) , exponential ( rainbow ) or sinuosidal hoppings .",
    "nonetheless , a theoretical explanation and a discussion of its validity are left for further work .",
    "it is relevant to ask whether it remains valid in higher dimensions , in different topologies , or in the presence of interactions .",
    "an interesting question is what is the origin of the energy used to excite the detector if the initial system is at zero temperature .",
    "the answer is the quench of the coupling between the system and the thermometer , with energy scale @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , the detector occupation always depends quadratically on that coupling . indeed , for low @xmath18 we should always rescale the results in order to obtain intrinsic properties of the probed system .",
    "it is also important to stress the difference between the local temperature measured and the unruh temperature . in order to observe the unruh effect",
    ", an observer will move with constant acceleration through the minkowski vacuum . from her point of view",
    ", this motion will translate into a change of her metric , which will become rindler .",
    "thus , as opposed to our case , she will observe the minkowski vacuum through the lens of a rindler hamiltonian , as shown in @xcite .    as a last remark",
    ", we would like to stress that our proposal for the definition of the local temperature is operational , and therefore it can lead to experimental observation .",
    "an interesting setting would be using ultracold atoms on an optical lattice .",
    "we would like to acknowledge very useful discussions with g. sierra , a. celi and m. lewenstein .",
    "this work was funded by grants fis-2012 - 33642 and fis-2012 - 38866-c05 - 1 , from the spanish government , and by the campus of excellence uam+csic .",
    "the unruh effect predicts moreover that the quantum fluctuations of such a detector will followq a fermi - dirac distribution for a free fermionic field and bose - einstein for a free bosonic field , as long as the spatial dimension is odd , or the opposite if it is even @xcite .",
    "the unruh effect has not been properly measured in the laboratory yet @xcite , although there are some promising directions @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a relevant indirect test was highlighted by bell and leinaas in 1983 @xcite , related to the sokolov - ternov effect : if an electron beam is accelerated in a synchrotron under a strong magnetic field it will self - polarize , but this polarization will not be complete .",
    "this can be explained in two ways , leading to the same predictions .",
    "the most usual is using the relativistic transformations of the interaction between the magnetic field and the spin .",
    "but , alternatively , we can consider the electron spin as an unruh - dewitt detector in a thermal bath due to its acceleration as it moves on curved paths through the minkowski vacuum ."
