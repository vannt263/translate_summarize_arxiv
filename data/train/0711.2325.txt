    "the branch of atomic physics associated with ultracold atoms , ions , and molecules now provides a rich and exciting arena for investigations of strongly interacting , many - body quantum systems . trapping and cooling techniques , coherent laser or microwave interactions , and applied magnetic fields enable exquisite control of both external ( motional ) and internal ( electronic ) degrees of freedom of the particles , allowing one to `` tailor '' particle - particle interactions and thereby implement a broad range of systems that can be described accurately and transparently by idealized ( but nontrivial ) many - body hamiltonians .",
    "an important example is the hubbard model , realized with ultracold atoms in periodic optical lattices  @xcite , while realizations of other novel and significant lattice - spin models have been proposed , for example , with dipolar molecules in optical lattices  @xcite and with chains of trapped atomic ions  @xcite .",
    "the common , defining feature of these systems is the possibility for quantum critical phenomena , i.e. , transitions between distinct quantum phases , in response to variations of an effective field or particle - particle interaction strength around some critical value .",
    "the above - mentioned schemes generally provide many - body quantum systems that are subject to short - range ( e.g. , nearest - neighbor ) interactions . another interesting and commonly studied class of many - body systems are those possessing long - range , or even infinite - range , interactions , for which theoretical models typically allow exact solutions in the thermodynamic limit , or at least enable efficient numerical solution for large numbers of particles .",
    "a standard and classic example is the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model  @xcite , which was originally introduced in nuclear physics and is described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 are collective angular momentum operators for @xmath2 spin-1/2 particles , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are parameters giving the effective magnetic field and spin - spin interaction strengths , respectively , and @xmath5 $ ] is an anisotropy parameter . in this model",
    ", each spin interacts identically with every other spin and the nature of this interaction may be ferromagnetic ( @xmath6 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "significantly , the model exhibits critical behavior at zero temperature ; in particular , either first- or second - order quantum phase transitions may occur ( depending on the choice of @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) as the ratio between @xmath4 and @xmath3 is varied across a critical value .",
    "this quantum critical behavior , combined with the relative simplicity of the model , has led to renewed theoretical interest in the lmg model from the point of view of studying entanglement properties of many - particle systems in relation to quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "bipartite entanglement measures characterizing entanglement between a pair of spins ( e.g. , the concurrence ) or between two blocks of spins ( e.g. , the entanglement entropy ) are relatively straightforward to compute for the lmg model and can display marked critical behavior and scaling at quantum critical points  @xcite .    given these interesting and very topical features of the lmg model , it follows that the physical realization of a system described accurately by such a model would provide a valuable test bed for studies of quantum critical phenomena and entanglement .",
    "however , the question naturally arises as to how realistic such an idealized model could be ; the assumption of `` infinite - range '' interactions is obviously demanding and implies a very specialized system .",
    "hamiltonians of the form  ( [ lmghamiltonian ] ) ( with @xmath9 ) have appeared recently in reduced two - mode models of atomic bose - einstein condensates undergoing tunnelling in double - well potentials or transitions between two internal atomic states  @xcite , and in models of a few trapped ions interacting with laser fields  @xcite , but emphasis in these works has been on unitary or adiabatic evolution from some initial atomic state to some final , prescribed ( entangled ) state , while flexibility of these systems with respect to parameters of the lmg model ( i.e. , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 ) appears limited .",
    "another possibility , furnished by the field of quantum optics , and for which long - range atom - atom interactions actually occur quite naturally , is cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed )  @xcite . here",
    ", one considers ensembles of atoms interacting , through an electronic transition , with a common electromagnetic field mode supported by an optical resonator . through this common coupling , the field mode can effectively mediate interactions between atoms located at quite arbitrary and separate positions within the mode .",
    "so , in particular , the concept of an interaction `` length '' becomes redundant in this setting and a collective description of the atoms is appropriate .",
    "in fact , that an ensemble of atoms coupled to a common field mode can be viewed as a many - body system of interacting spins was highlighted many years ago with the prediction of a thermal equilibrium phase transition in the celebrated dicke model of @xmath2 two - level atoms coupled to a single quantized field mode  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the annihilation operator for the field mode of frequency @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the atomic transition frequency , and @xmath4 is the atom - field coupling strength ( we set @xmath14 ) . in particular , above a certain critical value of the coupling strength",
    "the system enters a so - called `` superradiant '' phase  @xcite .",
    "this phase transition persists at zero temperature  @xcite , with associated critical behavior of both the atom - field and atom - atom quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "the critical coupling strength at zero temperature is given by @xmath15 , which means that @xmath4 must be comparable to the field and/or atomic transition frequencies if the transition regime is to be reached .",
    "for atomic dipole transitions , this is typically not the case and , in fact , if it happened to be so , then the model  ( [ dickehamiltonian ] ) would be inadequate ; in particular , the @xmath16 term [ omitted from  ( [ dickehamiltonian ] ) ] of the minimal coupling hamiltonian should be included and doing so one actually finds that no phase transition exists  @xcite .",
    "however , a recent proposal for realizing the dicke model quantum phase transition , based on raman transitions between stable atomic ground states in an optical cavity qed setting  @xcite , circumvents these issues by ( i ) implementing a system in which the relevant frequency and coupling scales are determined by light - induced frequency shifts and raman transition rates , and ( ii ) utilizing an open - system dynamics ( as opposed to a closed , hamiltonian system ) with input and output fields ( i.e. , external laser fields and cavity mode losses ) , thereby replacing a ( fragile ) thermal equilibrium phase transition with a ( robust ) dynamical , nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cavity output field offers a unique window on the system s behavior and properties , with , for example , fluorescence and quadrature - variance measurements providing dramatic signatures of criticality in the system , as well as quantitative measures of fluctuations and entanglement .",
    "these features of the optical cavity qed system , combined with the observation that , in the dispersive limit @xmath17 , the cavity mode may be adiabatically eliminated and the dicke hamiltonian reduced to the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , motivate us to explore the possibilities for studying the lmg model in such a setting .",
    "in particular , by generalizing the configuration of ref .",
    "@xcite to two cavity field modes and operating in a dispersive regime ( amounting to far - off - resonant raman transitions ) , we find that it is possible to implement atomic spin systems that are described by the most general lmg model  ( [ lmghamiltonian ] ) , and for which the hamiltonian dynamics may still dominate over losses to the output cavity fields , thus enabling the clear realization of critical phenomena , including both first- and second - order dynamical quantum phase transitions .",
    "we find also that the cavity output fields can again be used to provide clear and detailed probes of properties of the atomic collective - spin system , including entanglement , in the critical regime .",
    "we note that the present work bears some relation to studies of optical bistability and resonance fluorescence in cooperative atomic systems , which can also exhibit first- and second - order nonequilibrium phase transitions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there , however , the dynamics explicitly includes ( resonant ) coherent driving of the atomic system by an external laser field ( i.e. , the hamiltonian describing the system contains a driving term linear in @xmath20 or @xmath21 , rather than a direct spin - spin interaction term ) , and relatively little investigation has been made of the quantum entanglement associated with the critical behavior  @xcite .    a more specific outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sect : ferro_model ] is concerned with the presence and behavior of atom - atom ( or spin - spin ) entanglement in the system , particularly across the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",

    "[ sect : af_model ] we essentially repeat the analysis of the previous section , but focus on a parameter regime where a first - order phase transition occurs in the @xmath9 lmg model as the effective magnetic field parameter , @xmath3 , is varied . finally , in sec .  [ sect : conclusion ] we conclude and briefly discuss possible extensions of the current work .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath2 atoms coupled via electric dipole transitions to ( at most ) four laser fields and to a pair of orthogonally polarized optical cavity modes .",
    "the atomic level and excitation scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomic_level_scheme ] . in particular , the atoms are assumed to possess two stable electronic ground states ,",
    "labelled @xmath22 and @xmath23 , at energies ( @xmath14 ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the laser and cavity fields combine to drive raman transitions between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , via the excited atomic states @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( energies @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) .",
    "specifically , the laser fields , at frequencies @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , couple to the dipole transitions @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 with rabi frequencies @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively . cavity field @xmath11 , at frequency @xmath42 , couples to the transitions @xmath34 and @xmath37 with coupling strengths @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , while cavity field @xmath45 , at frequency @xmath46 , couples to the transitions @xmath35 and @xmath36 with coupling strengths @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . all of the fields will be assumed to be far - off resonance with the electric dipole transitions to which they couple , meaning that the atomic states @xmath26 and @xmath27 are only virtually excited and can be eliminated from the dynamics .",
    "finally , at the location of the atoms , the cavity and laser fields are taken to be travelling waves copropagating in the @xmath49 direction , with sufficiently broad beam waists so as to ensure a homogeneous atom - field coupling .          to facilitate adiabatic elimination of the atomic excited states we move to a rotating frame according to the unitary transformation @xmath50 , with @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a frequency close ( or possibly equal ) to @xmath25 .",
    "next , as mentioned above , we assume large detunings of the light fields from the atomic excited states , i.e. , we assume that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are much larger in magnitude than any other rates characterizing the system .",
    "this allows the atomic excited states to be adiabatically eliminated and also enables us to neglect the effects of atomic spontaneous emission .    additionally , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomic_level_scheme ] , we assume that only four distinct raman transitions are of significance ( i.e. , resonant or roughly resonant ) ; in particular , in our model we retain only those raman processes that cause a change in the electronic state of the atoms ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) and also involve transfer of a photon from a laser field into a cavity mode or vice versa .",
    "all other possible raman processes are assumed to be far - off resonant and therefore negligible .",
    "quantitatively , this requires , for example , that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are sufficiently large , with , in particular , @xmath59 .",
    "retaining only the four dominant raman processes simplifies the model considerably , and with a choice of laser frequencies such that @xmath60 we are able to remove all explicit time dependence from the hamiltonian describing our system . employing the collective spin operators , @xmath61 and omitting constant energy terms , our effective hamiltonian for the collective atomic system and cavity modes can be written in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and the effective parameters are given in terms of the microscopic parameters by    @xmath64    note that the ( dimensionless ) factors @xmath65 $ ] have been introduced for convenience .",
    "note also that for a characteristic level scheme as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atomic_level_scheme ] , one might typically expect that @xmath66 and @xmath67 , so assuming @xmath68 we would therefore also expect that @xmath69 .    in summary ,",
    "the master equation for the reduced density operator , @xmath70 ( i.e. , with the atomic excited states eliminated and spontaneous emission neglected ) , is given by @xmath71 + \\kappa_a d[a]\\rho_{\\rm g } + \\kappa_b d[b]\\rho_{\\rm g } , \\label{eq : master_eqn_atom_cavity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72\\rho = 2 a \\rho a^\\dagger - a^\\dagger a \\rho - \\rho a^\\dagger a$ ] and @xmath73 is the cavity field decay rate .",
    "we now consider the limit @xmath74 . in this limit ,",
    "the cavity modes are only ever weakly or virtually excited and may also be adiabatically eliminated from the dynamics .",
    "following the standard adiabatic elimination procedure  @xcite , we derive the following master equation for the reduced density operator , @xmath75 , of the collective atomic system alone : @xmath76 + \\gamma_a d[x_a^\\dagger]\\rho + \\gamma_b d[x_b^\\dagger]\\rho ,   \\label{eq : spin_master_eqn_general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 where the effective spin - spin interaction strengths and collective atomic dissipative rates are ( @xmath78 )    @xmath79    note that both dispersive nonlinear terms [ terms proportional to @xmath80 and @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) ] do not contribute in the adiabatic approximation since in this limit we assume a vacuum state for both cavity modes .",
    "taking a brief step backwards now to the atom - cavity hamiltonian  ( [ eq : heff ] ) , and using the input - output theory of open quantum optical systems  @xcite , we can derive quantum langevin equations for the cavity mode operators ; in particular , for the mode @xmath45 , we have ( neglecting the term proportional to @xmath81 ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 describes the quantum noise input to the cavity mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : implementation ] ) and satisfies the commutation relation @xmath84=\\delta(t - t')$ ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : qle ] ) illustrates the linear relationship between the cavity operator and atomic operator @xmath85 .",
    "the adiabatic limit of the preceding subsection amounts , in the present context , to the assumption that @xmath86 varies on a much slower time scale than @xmath87 [ and @xmath88 , so that we can write @xmath89 the cavity output field is given by @xmath90 , so we in turn obtain a direct relationship between the dynamics of the ( internal ) collective atomic spin and the ( external ) cavity output field . hence , spin - spin correlations of the form @xmath91 and @xmath92 could be deduced from correlations of the cavity output field , which may be measured , for example , by performing broadband homodyne detection on the emitted light  @xcite .",
    "the lmg model , originally introduced in nuclear physics to model collective motion in nuclei  @xcite , describes @xmath2 interacting fermions distributed on two @xmath2-fold degenerate levels ( denoted by @xmath93 ) separated by an energy @xmath94 . denoting the fermion annihilation operator by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the hamiltonian for this system may be written as @xmath98 introducing the collective spin operators",
    ", @xmath99 and @xmath100 allows us to reexpress the hamiltonian as @xmath101 this hamiltonian commutes with @xmath102 , thus conserving the total angular momentum , and with @xmath103 , corresponding to a parity ( spin - flip ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to rewrite this hamiltonian in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , defined via @xmath104 , giving the generalized lmg model , @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( we will only consider @xmath108 $ ] ) , and @xmath109 .    this model is well known for its second - order symmetry breaking phase transition in the ferromagnetic regime ( @xmath6 )  @xcite . for small interaction strength the system is in the normal phase , where the ground state is unique and polarized in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "as the interaction is increased above a critical value , @xmath110 , the system enters the broken phase , where the ground state becomes doubly degenerate and macroscopically displaced from its original configuration , thus breaking the parity symmetry . for the special case @xmath111 the hamiltonian also commutes with @xmath112 , thus enabling a direct analytic solution .",
    "all other cases @xmath113 lie in a separate universality class . in the antiferromagnetic regime , @xmath7 ,",

    "this gives @xmath147 where @xmath148 .",
    "while the raman channels involving the cavity mode @xmath45 could be omitted completely , here we retain one of them ( for reasons to be discussed below ) , with the choice @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , corresponding to @xmath151 .",
    "hence , the full master equation we consider is @xmath130 + \\frac{\\gamma_a}{n } d[2j_x]\\rho + \\frac{\\gamma_b}{n } d[j_+]\\rho , \\label{eq : master_equation_gamma0_lmg_model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath152 has been absorbed into @xmath153 .",
    "if we now consider the case where @xmath154 and @xmath155 , then the role played by each cavity mode in relation to the atomic system is quite distinct .",
    "specifically , cavity mode @xmath11 mediates the collective spin - spin interaction required for the hamiltonian dynamics ( with coupling strength @xmath156 ) , while cavity mode @xmath45 effectively mediates the collective atomic decay ( with rate @xmath157 ) .",
    "importantly , we note that @xmath158 implies a quite direct relationship between moments of the cavity mode operators @xmath45 and @xmath159 and moments of the collective atomic spin operators @xmath160 ; in particular , measurements of the output light field from cavity mode @xmath45 will provide , rather directly and transparently , characteristic properties of the collective atomic spin .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath118 model the two cavity modes mediate the collective spin - spin interaction on an equal footing , i.e. , @xmath161 , while the operators @xmath162 and @xmath163 are linear combinations of @xmath164 and @xmath165 , which leads to a somewhat less transparent ( i.e , arguably less convenient ) relationship between correlations of the cavity output fields and atomic spin - spin correlations .",
    "partially for this reason , we focus in this paper on the @xmath142 model , with a clear distinction between the effective roles of the two cavity modes and a potentially better suitability for measurements of the collective atomic spin properties .      to analyze the atomic - spin master equations presented in the preceding sections , we make use of both numerical and analytical techniques . for finite spin @xmath166 , the master equations can be solved numerically for quite large @xmath2  @xcite , owing to the linear scaling of the hilbert space dimension , @xmath167 , with the system size , i.e. , @xmath168 . in what follows , we will typically present results of numerical simulations for @xmath169 .    for very large system sizes , @xmath170 ,",
    "it is possible to linearize the quantum fluctuations around the mean spin state ( i.e. , around the `` bloch vector '' ) .",
    "first we find this mean spin state by calculating the steady - state solutions of the semiclassical equations of motion for the components of the bloch vector .",
    "after a suitable rotation ( determined by the mean state ) of the spin coordinate system , we use the holstein - primakoff ( hp ) representation of angular momentum operators  @xcite , which enables a systematic large-@xmath2 expansion of the master equation , to which we then apply the limit @xmath171 . while all of the results obtained in the linearized regime are exact analytical results , in many cases",
