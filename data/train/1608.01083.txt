    "it has been established that about @xmath5 of matter content ( @xmath6 )  @xcite in our universe is composed of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the standard cold dm ( cdm ) together with cosmological constant @xmath7 , @xmath7cdm model , is very compelling and convincing to explain our current observations . despite of this remarkable success",
    ", we are still struggling to disentangle the particle identities of dm since all the confirmed evidence for dm come from gravitational interaction of dm .",
    "any unexpected signatures in astrophysics , cosmology and particle physics may help us to better understand particle physics nature of dm .    meanwhile , there are still some persistent tensions in the measurement of the hubble constant @xmath0 and the structure growth rate @xmath8 ( the amplitude of matter fluctuations at scale around 8 mpc ) .",
    "the latest analysis  @xcite of hubble space telescope ( hst ) data gives @xmath9 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , which is about 3.4@xmath11 higher than the value given by ` planck `  @xcite within the @xmath7cdm model .",
    "also , ` planck `  data yields @xmath12 which is relatively larger than the low redshift measurements , such as weak lensing survey cfhtlens  @xcite , @xmath13",
    ".    the above tensions could be due to systematic uncertainties , or they may indicate new physics model beyond the standard @xmath7cdm .",
    "for example , increasing the effective number of neutrinos by @xmath14 with dark radiation ( dr ) could resolve the conflict between ` planck `  and hst data  @xcite , which , however , unfortunately would give an even larger @xmath1 .",
    "or it is possible to extend the six - parameter @xmath7cdm with varying dark energy , dark matter , neutrino mass , running spectral index , and so on  @xcite , to relax these tensions in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in this letter",
    ", we shall explore a dark sector model in which dm interacts with dr through light dark photon and address the above issues .",
    "the interaction between dm and dr causes a suppression of the matter power spectrum through diffusion or collisional damping which can give a smaller @xmath8 .",
    "also the natural presence of dr would relieve the tension between hst and ` planck ` .",
    "this paper is organized as following .",
    "firstly , we shall introduce our model setup with the conventions and the relevant parameters .",
    "then we discuss the corresponding phenomenologies , dm relic density , prediction of @xmath15 and the dm - dr scattering with late kinetic decoupling .",
    "later , we show some numerical results on the matter power spectrum .",
    "finally , we give our summary .",
    "we introduce a dark sector with a new @xmath16 dark gauge symmetry and coupling @xmath17 , dark photon field @xmath18 , scalar @xmath19 , massive fermion @xmath20 ( dm ) and massless @xmath21 ( dr ) .",
    "all these new fields are living in the dark sector , thereby being sm gauge singlets .",
    "we assign @xmath16 charges @xmath22 to @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "then the general gauge invariant lagrangian is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the singlet right - handed ( rh ) neutrino which couples to the left - handed ( lh ) neutrinos in the sm through usual yukawa terms , the superscript ` @xmath26 ' stands for charge conjugate , the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath19 does not develop a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and this new @xmath16 is a good symmetry .",
    "we could introduce a mass for @xmath18 and possible gauge kinetic mixing term , , or by introducing another @xmath16-charged scalar with nonzero vev .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for constraints on kinetic mixing . ]",
    "which however is not essential for our discussions , and which we shall come back to later .    except for the higgs and yukawa terms ,",
    "our model is very similar to the structure in standard model .",
    "some simple variants of this model is equally suited for our interests in the paper .",
    "for example , @xmath19 can be a singlet and couples as @xmath30 .",
    "in any case @xmath19 is not stable and can decay into @xmath21 , and @xmath21 can be thermalized with @xmath31 and @xmath18 through the yukawa couplings with @xmath19 .",
    "we note that a similar setup was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors assumed @xmath32 , but did not consider possible yukawa interactions between @xmath21 with the @xmath19 .",
    "yukawa interaction among @xmath19 and @xmath21 can lead to thermalization of @xmath21 at high temperature , which is different from thermalization mechanism at lower temperature through dark gauge interactions considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the resulting @xmath33 would be different .    finally , the connection to the sm sector can be established in a straightforward manner through the higgs portal term , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the sm higgs doublet .",
    "simple estimation shows that @xmath19 and dark sector can be in thermal equilibrium with sm particles when the universe is around @xmath36 if @xmath37 .",
    "now , let us discuss some relevant phenomenology and constraints , based on the lagrangian of eq .",

    "( [ eq : relic ] ) can be treated as the upper limit for @xmath43 , since if there were other annihilation processes contributing to the depletion of @xmath20 particles , then @xmath43 could be smaller .",
    "for instance , @xmath44 can be important if @xmath45 .",
    "however , for our interests in this paper , the qualitative relation above between @xmath43 and @xmath46 would be sufficient , which means that for @xmath36-scale @xmath20 it is expected to have @xmath47 to get the correct relic density .",
    "dm @xmath20 s self - scattering through exchanging @xmath19 can be sizable if the mass of @xmath19 ( @xmath48 ) is small , which is the central topics in recent self - interacting dark matter scenarios , ( see refs .",

    "note that @xmath21 can be in thermal equilibrium with @xmath18 and @xmath19 at high temperature due to the yukawa interactions because it can leads to an interacting rate @xmath58 .",

    "the above formula , eq .  [ eq : geff ] , is valid in general contexts . in the literature ,",

    "as long as its mass is much smaller than temperature @xmath51 around radiation - matter equality time , say @xmath119 , our above discussions still hold .",

    "we present a local @xmath123 scalar dm model originating from dark @xmath120 gauge symmetry @xcite , in which the dark higgs @xmath124 has a dark charge @xmath125 while dm @xmath122 has a dark charge @xmath126 .",

    "s scattering and other effects are similar to what we discussed above , except that now new higgs - portal term can provide direct detection signals .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated a model for a dark sector where dark matter ( dm ) interacts with fermionic dark radiation ( dr ) through a light gauge boson ( dark photon ) in order to resolve some tensions in cosmological data .",
    "the new light gauge boson ( dark photon ) plays a key role both in the dm - dr elastic scattering and in the late kinetic decoupling .",
    "this simple model can provide the right amount of dr ( @xmath2 ) , thereby resolving the tension in hubble constant @xmath0 between ` planck `  and hst data .",
    "also the elastic scattering between dm and dr causes the collisional damping and has impact on the structure growth rate , which leads to a smaller @xmath1 and relaxes the conflicts between ` planck `   and weak lensing measurement .",

    "<S> motivated by the tensions in the hubble constant @xmath0 and the structure growth @xmath1 between ` planck `  results and other low redshift measurements , we discuss some cosmological effects of a dark sector model in which dark matter ( dm ) interacts with fermionic dark radiation ( dr ) through a light gauge boson ( dark photon ) . such kind of models are very generic in particle physics with a dark sector with dark gauge symmetries . the effective number of neutrinos is increased by @xmath2 due to light dark photon and fermionic dr , thereby resolving the conflicts in @xmath0 . the elastic scattering between dm and dr induces suppression for dm s density perturbation , but without acoustic oscillations . for weakly - interacting </S>",
