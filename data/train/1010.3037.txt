    "strong gravitational lenses allow for the detailed study of distant background galaxies through the magnification provided by lensing . models of these systems also provide interesting constraints on the underlying foreground lens mass distribution which includes the distribution of dark matter . beginning with the serendipitous discovery of the 8oclock arc @xcite we have initiated the sloan bright arcs survey ( sbas ) , a systematic search of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging database to search for candidate strong lensed systems .",
    "the first confirmed system from our systematic search was dubbed `` the clone '' @xcite , which was followed by the discovery of six other systems described in @xcite .",
    "more recently we reported the discovery of four high redshift @xmath7 systems in @xcite . to date",
    "we have discovered a dozen strong lens systems by mining the existing sdss imaging data .    in this letter",
    "we report on a set of seven new systems in the sdss imaging data which we have confirmed to be bona - fide strong lens systems .",
    "these systems were confirmed via spectroscopy using the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope in new mexico or the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : candidate selection and follow - up spectroscopy are described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we report the details of each system including preliminary mass models and in section 4 we summarize our results . throughout the letter we use a flat cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 .",
    "we searched for candidate strong lens systems in the @xmath12 of sdss imaging data .",
    "specifically we performed two systematic searches of the sdss data release five @xcite and data release six @xcite .",
    "our first candidate list was generated using the sdss catalog archive server ( cas ) database .",
    "two separate queries were performed in which we searched for blue objects around a catalog of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; @xcite ) and a catalog of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) generated using the maxbcg optical cluster finder algorithm @xcite .",
    "systems were then separated into groups depending on the number of blue objects , @xmath13 , around each lrg or bcg .",
    "each group of candidates was then visually examined by four different inspectors and flagged if they exhibited an arc - like morphology .",
    "the most promising systems were then chosen for follow - up .",
    "our query for @xmath14 objects produced a list of @xmath15 candidates and one confirmed system discovered in this search is presented in section @xmath16 .",
    "our second list is generated by performing a search against a catalog of merging galaxies generated using the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "a merging galaxy pair is defined here as two galaxies in the range @xmath17 which are separated by less than the sum of their respective pertrosian radii @xcite .",
    "we ran this algorithm on imaging data from the sdss dr6 and visually examined and classified the resulting catalog .",
    "a total of 5739 candidates were flagged by the algorithm and upon visual inspection a list of 2761 objects were flagged as possible strong lens candidates . in section",
    "@xmath16 we report on six systems that have been followed - up from this list which we have confirmed to be strongly lensed galaxies .",
    "candidate systems were followed up with the dual imaging spectrograph iii ( dis ) on the apache point observatory 3.5 m telescope .",
    "dis is a medium dispersion double spectrograph that has separated red and blue channels .",
    "the standard b400/r300 grating setup was used , which covers a spectral range of @xmath18 .",
    "the dispersion is 1.83  per pixel in the blue and 2.31  per pixel in the red .",
    "we targeted each of our seven arcs with a typical exposure time of @xmath19s .",
    "we used a @xmath20 or @xmath21 slit oriented along the brightest segment of the arc in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf tasks which we described previously in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "redshift measurements were done using the xcsao task in the iraf external package rvsao @xcite by cross - correlation @xcite against galaxy templates . for the templates , we used the composite lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) template of @xcite to cross - correlate against our higher - redshift source galaxies , and we used the galaxy templates from the sdss dr2 template set ( specifically template numbers 23 - 28 , spanning the range of early- to late - type galaxies ) for our lens galaxies and our lower - redshift source galaxies .",
    "we also followed - up one system , @xmath22 , with the rc spectrograph ( rcspec ) , a low to moderate resolution spectrograph on the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "we observed this system in long slit mode ( with slit width of @xmath23 ) and used the kpc-10a grating and the wg-345 order block filter to cover a wavelength range of about @xmath24  ( with a dispersion 2.75  per pixel ) .",
    "the total exposure time was @xmath25s ( @xmath19s and @xmath26s ) .",
    "data for this system were also reduced with standard iraf tasks .",
    "the seven new strong lens systems are shown in figure [ fig : arcs1 ] .",
    "each system has a dominant lrg and bluish arc located within an angular separation of @xmath27 of the central lrg . to characterize the environment of each system we matched the lens coordinates against the gmbcg galaxy cluster catalog @xcite .",
    "the gmbcg algorithm @xcite is a red sequence based cluster finding algorithm that calculates a gmbcg richness ( @xmath28 ) for each cluster , defined as the number of galaxies within a radius @xmath29 centered on the bcg .",
    "the radius @xmath29 is the radius in which the mass density falls to 200 times the critical density of the universe @xcite .",
    "six out of seven systems are matched to clusters in the gmbcg catalog , and each of the central lrgs is identified by the gmbcg algorithm as the bcg and also the central galaxy in each group .",
    "one of our lens systems ( @xmath22 ) is associated with a moderately rich cluster with @xmath30 , while five other matching systems are associated with lower ` group - scale ' objects which lie in the richness range @xmath31 .",
    "the remaining system ( @xmath32 ) did not have a corresponding gmbcg richness measurement ( see section @xmath33 ) .",
    "because of the relatively poor image quality of the sdss images ( seeing @xmath34 , detailed models of our systems are not possible",
    ". instead we adopt a simple model and describe each system with a singular isothermal sphere @xcite .",
    "the resulting velocity dispersions fall in the range @xmath35 @xmath36 , which correspond to enclosed masses between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "magnitudes of the arc in each system are given in table 1 and are in sdss model magnitudes unless otherwise stated . in some cases the arc is split into multiple knots by the sdss image deblender and in these cases the reported arc magnitude is the total sum of the individual knots .",
    "for one system @xmath39 the arc is not detected in the sdss photometry and we independently measure and report the isophotal magnitude with sextractor @xcite .",
    "below we briefly describe each system and present spectra for each arc shown in black in figures [ fig : spectra1 ] and [ fig : spectra2 ] . for comparison the composite lbg template in emission , we have interpolated over the strong ly @xmath40 emission line in the lbg template for both cross - correlation and plotting purposes .",
    "we apply this interpolation as it improves the significance of the cross - correlation peak when ly @xmath40 is present in the spectrum . ] or the sdss galaxy template is shown in red , shifted to the same redshift of each source galaxy .",
    "a summary of all arc parameters is given in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "@xmath22 appeared in our search around bcgs and matches to a moderately rich galaxy cluster in the gmbcg cluster catalog with @xmath30 .",
    "the lens consists of two lrgs with a blue arc located directly to the south .",
    "for the eastern - most lrg ( @xmath41 ) we measure the spectroscopic redshift of the lrg to be @xmath42 . for the western lrg ( @xmath43 ) we measure a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath44 .",
    "both lrgs are also members of the cluster as identified by the gmbcg algorithm .",
    "the blue arc is split by the sdss imaging deblender into two knots , which combined give a total magnitude of @xmath45 . along the arc we used data from both rcspec and dis to produce the coadded spectrum ( total exposure time of 7560 s ) shown in figure [ fig : spectra1 ] .",
    "cross - correlation against the lbg template yields a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath46 for the arc .",
    "the spectrum plotted shows typical lbg absorption features due to ly @xmath40 , si , o , c , si , and c . with a measured einstein radius of @xmath47 , this corresponds to an enclosed mass of @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 appeared in our merging galaxy catalog .",
    "the lens is a part of a small group of galaxies with @xmath50 .",
    "the bcg in this group ( @xmath51 ) has a spectroscopic redshift determined from dis to be @xmath52 ( not shown ) . a blue arc to the southwest",
    "is split into three knots which give an overall arc magnitude of @xmath53 . along the arc",
    "we obtain the spectrum plotted in figure [ fig : spectra1 ] , which shows typical , though relatively weak , lbg absorption features due to si , c , and o , and we measure a cross - correlation redshift of @xmath54 . with a measured einstein radius of @xmath55 this gives an enclosed mass of @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 was flagged as a candidate in our merging galaxy catalog .",
    "the lens is a group of galaxies with @xmath58 , with 2 - 3 lrgs interior to the arc .",
    "the brightest lrg ( @xmath59 ) has a spectroscopic redshift determined with dis of @xmath60 ( not shown ) .",

    "the entire arc has a total magnitude of @xmath62 .",
    "along the arc we obtain a spectrum that readily shows lbg absorption lines due to c , o , si , si , c , fe , and al , and we find a cross - correlation redshift for the arc of @xmath63 ( figure [ fig : spectra1 ] ) . with a measured einstein radius of @xmath64",

    "is a blue arc which is detected as a single object with @xmath80 .",
    "with dis we measure five prominent emission lines [ o ] 3727 , [ o ] 4959 , [ o ] 5007 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( figure [ fig : spectra2 ] ) which place the arc at a redshift @xmath83 .",

    "a blue extended arc is located to the east of the central lrg .",
    "this lens did not appear in the gmbcg catalog since it is located at the edge of the sdss survey area .",

    "we did not obtain redshifts for the two foreground galaxies associated with the central lrg . in the arc we measure four prominent emission lines : [ o ] 3727 , @xmath81 , [ o ] 4959 , and [ o ] 5007 , as shown in figure [ fig : spectra2 ] , placing the arc at a redshift of @xmath91 . with a measured einstein radius of @xmath92",

    "independent cross - correlations of the blue spectrum against the composite lbg template , and the red spectrum against an sdss emission - line galaxy template ( number 27 ) , result in consistent redshift measurements , which we then combine to place the arc at a final redshift of @xmath99 .",

    "we have presented seven new strong lens systems from the sbas , our ongoing search for strongly lensed galaxies in the sdss imaging data .",
