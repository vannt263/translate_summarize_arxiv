    "with the new observation of @xmath7 meson , the spectrum of the charmed - strange state is becoming abundant .",
    "so far , there exist six established charmed - strange mesons @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 listed in particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , which can be categorized as three doublets in terms of the heavy quark limit : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "two years ago , a new charmed - strange meson @xmath17 with @xmath18 was firstly announced by the babar collaboration @xcite and confirmed by the belle collaboration later @xcite .",
    "very recently the babar experiment found @xmath17 again in the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "another newly observed charmed - strange meson is @xmath20 , which was observed in both @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath19 channels @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological proposals of the quantum number of @xmath20 include @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "as indicated by the babar experiment , @xmath24 assignment for @xmath20 is forbidden according to the parity conservation since the @xmath19 decay mode of @xmath20 was observed in ref .",
    "a series of theoretical work @xcite relevant to @xmath17 and @xmath20 were carried out .",
    "besides the observations of @xmath17 and @xmath20 by analyzing the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum in inclusive @xmath25 interactions @xcite , babar also announced a new charmed - strange state @xmath26 with the mass @xmath27 mev and the width @xmath28 mev @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath26 not only makes the spectrum of the charmed - strange meson abundant ( the mass spectrum of the observed charmed - strange mesons are listed in fig . [ mass ] ) , but also stimulates our interest in exploring its underlying structure .    as indicated by the babar collaboration , @xmath26 was only observed in @xmath19 channel while not find in @xmath21 decay mode .",
    "thus , its possible quantum number includes @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath30 is the first radial excitation of @xmath31 and the mass of @xmath26 is far larger than that of @xmath32 , thus we further exclude @xmath33 assignment , _ viz_. the first radial excitation of @xmath8 for @xmath26 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , matsuki , morii and sudoh once predicted the mass of @xmath34 state with @xmath35 : @xmath36 mev , which is close to the experimental value of the mass of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 assignment to @xmath26 , the first radial excitation of @xmath11 , becomes the most possible .    if @xmath26 as the radial excitation of p - wave charmed - strange state is true , further experiment is of the potential to search the rest three radial excitations of p - wave charmed - strange states .",
    "thus , a systematical phenomenological study of the strong decay mode of p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the first radial excitation is an important and interesting topic . by this study",
    ", we will not only obtain the information the decays of these p - wave charmed - strange mesons , but also can test @xmath37 quantum number assignment to @xmath26 comparing calculated decay width with the experimental data .    in this work , we will be dedicated to the study of the strong decay modes of p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the radial excitation by the @xmath38 model @xcite .",
    "further we will obtain the information of the order of magnitude of the strong decay modes of @xmath26 .",
    "c    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we briefly review the @xmath38 model and present the formulation of the strong decays of p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the radial excitation .",
    "finally , the numerical result will be shown .",
    "the last section is a short summary .",
    "before illustrating the strong decay of p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the radial excitation , we first introduce the category of the heavy flavor meson .    in the heavy quark limit @xmath39 ,",
    "the heavy quark plays a role of a static color source to interact with the light part within the heavy flavor hadron .",
    "thus , the spin of the heavy quark @xmath40 can be separated from the total angular momentum @xmath41 of the heavy flavor hadron .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 is a good quantum number , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the spin of the light part of the heavy flavor hadron and the orbital angular momentum between the light part and the heavy quark , respectively .",
    "thus , the heavy mesons can be grouped into doublets according to @xmath45 , which include @xmath46 doublet @xmath47 with the orbital angular momentum @xmath48 , @xmath49 doublet @xmath50 and @xmath51 doublet @xmath52 with @xmath53 . for @xmath54 there exist @xmath55 and @xmath56 doublets with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . as showing in fig .",
    "[ mass ] , the states existing in the doublets @xmath59 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 are already filled with the observed charmed - strange mesons .",
    "two @xmath37 states existing @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mixture of two basis states @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite @xmath64 where one takes the mixing angle @xmath65 according to the estimate in the heavy quark limit .    for p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the radial excitation discussed in this work ,",
    "one also categorizes them as @xmath66 and @xmath67 doublets according to the above approach .",
    "two @xmath37 states are the mixture of two basis states @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which satisfy the below relation @xmath70 in this work , we approximately take @xmath71 .    for distinguishing p - wave states with and without the first radial excitation ,",
    "one labels four p - wave states without the first radial excitation as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "four p - wave states with the first radial excitation are named as @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if we set the upper limit of the masses of p - wave states with the first radial excitation as 3.04 gev , the kinematically allowed decay modes of p - wave states with the first radial excitation are listed in table [ decay modes ] . in the following",
    ", the @xmath38 model will be applied to calculate these strong decays in table [ decay modes ] .",
    ".the relevant strong decay modes of p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the first radial excitation allowed by the conservation of the quantum number . here  @xmath80 \" denotes that the decay modes are kinematically forbidden if setting the upper limit of the masses of p - wave states with the first radial excitation as 3.04 gev .",
    "since the @xmath37 state in the @xmath81 doublet decays into @xmath82 via d - wave , it is very narrow and denoted as @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 state in the @xmath84 doublet decays into @xmath82 via s - wave .",
    "hence , it is very broad and denoted as @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "[ decay modes ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the dependence of the strong decays @xmath86 on the factor @xmath87 ( @xmath88 value of the ho wavefunction of @xmath89 ) is given in fig .",
    "[ 2 t ] . here , we take the mass of @xmath89 as 3.157 gev @xcite . when taking @xmath90 gev@xmath91 , the total decay width of @xmath89 is 87.9 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ compare-1 t ] ) , and the partial decay widths ( see fig . [ 2 t ] ) respectively corresponding to @xmath86 are 15.6 mev , 0.49 mev , 7.2 mev , 49.3 mev , 1.8 mev , 13.2 mev , 0.28 mev , which show that @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are key decay channels to find @xmath89 charmed - strange meson .",
    "stimulated by the newly observed charmed - strange meson @xmath0 , we systemically study the two - body strong decays of p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the first radial excitation .",
    "our numerical results show that @xmath0 can be categorized as @xmath37 state in @xmath96 doublet well , i.e. @xmath0 is the first radial excitation of @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest experimentalist to search @xmath0 by @xmath3 channel ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .    in the past six years",
    ", babar and belle experiments have made big progress in searching for charmed - strange mesons , which lets us believe that more charmed - strange mesons will be found in future experiment . if @xmath0 is the first radial excitation of @xmath2 , there must exist three partners of @xmath0 , which are the rest three p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the first radial excitation . in this work",
    ", we also study the strong decays of the rest three p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the first radial excitation . our numerical result ( see the presentation in the subsection of numerical result ) will be helpful to instruct future experimental search of the remaining three p - wave charmed - strange mesons with the first radial excitation .    _ * note added . *",
    "_ when this manuscript was completed , a work of @xmath0 appeared @xcite . in this work , authors investigated the @xmath97 mesons by a semi - classic flux tube model and explained @xmath0 as @xmath98 . in our case , we calculated the strong decays of @xmath0 with the assignment of the first radial excitation of @xmath11 . by comparing the total decay width of @xmath0 obtained by the @xmath38 model with the babar data ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 is the first radial excitation of @xmath11 , which is consistent with the conclusion of the structure of @xmath0 @xcite .",
