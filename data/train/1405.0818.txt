    "these models are generally based on the chiral symmetry and using the vector meson dominance model @xcite for the intermediate states description .",

    "only the ground - state intermediate axial - vector meson @xmath19(1260 ) was taken into account .",
    "however , the mass of @xmath1-lepton allows one also to consider an intermediate radially excited @xmath19(1640 ) meson in these processes . in a recent paper @xcite radially excited axial - vector mesons in the extended njl model",
    "were described .",
