    "it is widely accepted that general relativity and quantum mechanics are incompatible in their current form , yet a theory reconciling the two remains elusive . despite this problem , it is only at the smallest length scales ( @xmath8 ) , or highest energies , that we expect substantial modification to existing theory . at low energies , away from spacetime singularities , the propagation of quantum fields on gravitational backgrounds",
    "is well understood ( see the books by birrell & davies  @xcite or chandrasekhar  @xcite ) .",
    "interest in the absorption of quantum waves by black holes was reignited in the 1970s , following hawking s discovery that black holes can emit , as well as scatter and absorb , radiation  @xcite .",
    "hawking showed that the evaporation rate is proportional to the total absorption cross section .",
    "more recently , absorption cross sections ( or `` grey body factors '' ) have been of interest in the context of higher - dimensional string theories .    in a series of papers",
    "@xcite sanchez considered the scattering and absorption of massless scalar particles by an uncharged , spherically - symmetric ( schwarzschild ) black hole . using numerical methods she showed that the total absorption cross section ( as a function of incident frequency ) exhibits oscillations around the geometric - optics limit characteristic of diffraction patterns .",
    "unruh  @xcite studied the absorption of massive spin - half particles by piecing together analytic solutions to the dirac equation across three regions .",
    "he showed that , in the low - energy limit , the scattering cross section for the fermion is exactly @xmath9 of that for the scalar particle .",
    "he also derived an approximation to the total cross section valid at low energies , which we revisit in section  [ sec - results ] .",
    "in this paper we return to the massive fermion absorption problem studied by unruh .",
    "we employ a different coordinate system , but retain equivalent ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon .",
    "instead of using analytical approximations we numerically integrate the dirac equation to calculate the absorption cross section over a range of energies and gravitational couplings .",
    "we compare our results with the classical cross section for a massive particle , and with unruh s low - energy approximation .",
    "the natural dimensionless parameter to describe the strength of the gravitational coupling between a black hole ( of mass @xmath10 ) and a quantum particle ( of mass @xmath11 ) is given by @xmath12 where @xmath3 is the schwarzschild radius of the hole , @xmath13 is the compton wavelength of the quantum particle , and @xmath14 is the planck mass .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath15 because it has an analogous role in gravitation to the fine - structure constant in electromagnetism .",
    "we expect quantum effects to be important when @xmath16 , whereas in the high-@xmath15 limit classical effects should dominate .    in first - quantised theory",
    "the capture of light and matter by a black hole is a one - way process .",
    "the direction of time implied by this process is not revealed in schwarzschild coordinates , however , as these are manifestly time - reverse symmetric and are invalid at the horizon .",
    "time - asymmetric coordinates , such as eddington ",
    "finkelstein coordinates , allow the continuation of the metric across the horizon and allow us to correctly study the properties of wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "we then find that ingoing states correspond precisely to those that are regular at the horizon .    here , rather than using eddington ",
    "finkelstein coordinates , we prefer to work with the coordinates first introduced by painlev  @xcite and gullstrand  @xcite . in these coordinates the metric becomes @xmath17 the utility of this form of the schwarzschild solution has recently been highlighted by martel & poisson  @xcite and others  @xcite . for black holes ( as opposed to white holes ) the negative sign for the crossterm @xmath18 is the correct choice , as this guarantees that all particles fall in across the horizon in a finite proper time .",
    "this sign is also uniquely picked out by models in which the black hole is formed by a collapse process  @xcite .",
    "one advantage of this system is that the time coordinate has a natural interpretation as the proper time measured by an observer in freefall starting from rest at infinity .    according to general relativity",
    "the classical absorption cross section of a schwarzschild black hole is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity of the particle  @xcite .",
    "in accordance with the equivalence principle , the cross section is independent of the particle mass @xmath11 .",
    "we expect that the quantum cross section will approach this value in the limit @xmath21 ( that is , @xmath22 ) .",
    "we start with the radial separation of the dirac equation in painlev  gullstrand coordinates .",
    "we then study the properties of solutions around the horizon , identifying the physical branch of regular solutiuons .",
    "for unbound states @xmath23 we find that the physical solutions are composed of ingoing and outgoing waves at infinity . by numerically finding the ratios of these waves in any given angular mode we are able to compute the absorption spectrum .",
    "we use natural coordinates @xmath24 , except in cases where inclusion of the factors adds clarity .",
    "we let @xmath25 denote the gamma matrices in the dirac  pauli representation , and introduce spherical polar coordinates @xmath26 . from these we define the unit polar matrices @xmath27 in terms of these we define four position - dependent matrices @xmath28 by @xmath29 these satisfy the anti - commutation relations @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the painlev  gullstrand metric of equation  ( [ painleve ] ) .",
    "the reciprocal matrices @xmath32 are defined by the equation @xmath33 and both sets are well - defined everywhere except at the origin .",

    "the interaction term is non - hermitian , as the singularity acts as a sink for probability density , making absorption possible .",
    "the dirac equation is clearly seperable in time , so has solutions that go as @xmath39 .",
    "the energy @xmath2 conjugate to time - translation is independent of the chosen coordinate system , and has a physical definition in terms of the killing time  @xcite .",
    "we can further exploit the spherical symmetry to seperate the spinor into @xmath40 where @xmath41 the angular eigenmodes are labeled by @xmath42 , which is a positive or negative nonzero integer , and @xmath43 , which is the total angular momentum in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "our convention for these eigenmodes is that @xmath45 the positive and negative @xmath42 modes are related by @xmath46 and are normalised so that @xmath47    the trial function ( [ trispn ] ) results in a pair of coupled first - order equations @xmath48 the equations have regular singular points at the origin and horizon , as well as an irregular singular point at @xmath49 . as far as we are aware",
    ", the special function theory required to deal with such equations has not been developed .",
    "instead we use series solutions around the singular points as initial data for a numerical integration scheme .",
    "as is clear from ( [ matrixeqn ] ) , there is a regular singular point in the coupled equations at the horizon , @xmath50 .",
    "we look for series solutions @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the lowest power in the series , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 as coefficients to be determined . on substituting into ( [ matrixeqn ] ) and setting @xmath50",
    "we obtain an eigenvalue equation for @xmath52 , which has solutions @xmath55 the regular root @xmath56 ensures that we can construct solutions which are finite and continuous at the horizon .",
    "we will see later that regular solutions automatically have an ingoing current at the horizon .",
    "the singular branch gives rise to discontinuous , unnormalisable solutions with an outgoing current at the horizon  @xcite .",
    "we therefore restrict attention to the regular , physically - admissable solutions .",
    "the eigenvector for the regular solution has @xmath57    in order to expand about infinity we need to take care of the irregular singularity present there .",
    "there are two sets of solutions , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which asymptotically resemble outgoing and ingoing radial waves with additional radially - dependent phase factors .",
    "to lowest order , @xmath60 where the phase factors @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 and the momentum @xmath63 is defined in the usual way , @xmath64 .",
    "the general ( regular ) solution as @xmath65 is a superposition of the ingoing and outgoing waves , @xmath66 for each angular mode .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath67 and @xmath68 determine the amount of scattered and absorbed radiation present .",
    "the spatial probability current is conserved for states with real energy , @xmath69 . for each angular eigenmode",
    "we obtain a conserved wronskian @xmath70 @xmath71 which measures the total outward flux over a surface of radius @xmath72 . at the horizon",
    "@xmath73 so the flux is inwards for all regular solutions . on substituting the asymptotic forms of equations",
    "( [ asympt1 ] ) and ( [ asympt2 ] ) into equation ( [ wronsk_def ] ) we find an expression for the wronskian in the large-@xmath72 limit , @xmath74 the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be determined ( up to an overall magnitude and phase ) by matching the ingoing ( regular ) solution at the horizon to the asymptotic form in the large-@xmath72 limit .",
    "we choose the normalisation of each angular mode so that @xmath75 , and write the most general solution to the wave equation as @xmath76 where @xmath77 are spinors of the trial form with @xmath78 as given by ( [ asympt1 ] ) , ( [ asympt2 ] ) , and @xmath79 are complex coefficients .",
    "the total absorbed flux is then just @xmath80    we now employ a partial wave analysis to derive a simple expression for the absorbed cross section .",
    "we write the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath81 as the sum of a plane wave ( propagating in the @xmath82 direction ) and an outgoing scattered wave , @xmath83 where @xmath84 are constant spinors .",
    "the plane wave can be decomposed into ingoing and outgoing radial waves in the large-@xmath72 limit .",
    "we equate the ingoing part of the plane wave with the ingoing part of the asymptotic wave ( [ asympt2 ] ) .",
    "normalising the plane wave to @xmath85 particles per unit volume we find @xmath86 for each angular mode .",

    "we determine the coefficients @xmath67 required for ( [ total_cs ] ) by matching the ingoing solution at the horizon to the asymptotic form ( [ asympt2 ] ) at infinity . in a similar calculation ,",
    "unruh  @xcite used analytic approximations to the radial functions to find the leading contributions to the cross section . here",
    ", we use numerical integration of the wavefunction out from the horizon to match the solutions , and compare our results with the analytic approach .     with the classical prediction for a point particle [ dotted ] , for a gravitational coupling of @xmath91 .",

    "we find the period of these oscillations is approximately constant , but the amplitude decays as @xmath95 . as @xmath15 is increased we find that the magnitude and period of the oscillations decreases . in the @xmath96 limit we recover the classical cross section .    .",
    "the horizontal line is the photon limit .",
