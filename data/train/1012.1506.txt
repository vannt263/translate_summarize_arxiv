    "magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , i.e. hydrodynamic turbulence together with dynamo generated magnetic fields , is a particularly complex phenomenon that is still far from being fully understood .",
    "this is hardly surprising in view of the fact that the number of degrees of freedom is roughly doubled in comparison with its purely hydrodynamic version .",
    "the complexities of the details of mhd - turbulence stand in stark contrast to the observed simple structures such as planetary dipolar fields nearly aligned with the axis of rotation or the solar magnetic cycle with its surprisingly regular period of 22 years .",
    "it is thus understandable that numerous attempts have been made to find simple balances or to devise simplifying concepts in order to gain some understanding of the dynamics of mhd - turbulence .    in the following the validity of some of the assumptions that have been widely used in dynamo theory",
    "will be discussed .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to buoyancy - driven motions which are responsible for the generation of planetary and stellar magnetic fields and even within this restricted field no completeness will be attempted .",
    "the simplest approach for analyzing magnetohydrodynamic phenomena is the consideration of the dynamics of an electrically conducting fluid in the presence of an imposed magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "this approach has been used by several theoreticians and experimenters in the period from approximately 1950 to 1970 in order to understand the onset of thermal convection in the presence of a uniform imposed @xmath0 .",
    "an account of these efforts can be found in chandrasekhar s ( 1961 ) famous treatise . in later years",
    "nonlinear aspects of the interaction between convection and the imposed magnetic field have been studied .",
    "we refer to the review of proctor and weiss ( 1982 ) .    of special interest",
    "is the role of magnetic fields in the case of convection in a rotating system . as described in chandrasekhar s ( 1961 ) book the onset of convection",
    "is strongly inhibited in systems with a vertical axis of rotation or , in a non - rotating system , by an imposed vertical magnetic field when the fluid is electrically conducting .",
    "the critical value @xmath1 of the rayleigh number @xmath2 for onset of convection thus increases with the @xmath3-power of the coriolis number @xmath4 in the non - magnetic system while it increases in proportion to the chandrasekhar number @xmath5 in a non - rotating system .",
    "but in systems with both a vertical axis of rotation and an applied vertical magnetic field the onset of convection is facilitated by the counteracting effects of the coriolis force and lorentz force such that @xmath1 may increase only linearly with @xmath4 ( eltayeb 1972 ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameters introduced here and the ordinary and magnetic prandtl numbers are defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the flux density of the applied magnetic field , the angular velocity of rotation , the magnetic permeability , the kinematic viscosity , the thermal diffusivity , the density and the magnetic diffusivity , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the applied temperature difference between the boundaries and @xmath10 is the distance between them ; @xmath11 is the coefficient of thermal expansion and @xmath12 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "the inverse of @xmath4 is also known as the ekman number .",
    "the optimal balance between the coriolis force and the lorentz force which minimizes @xmath1 is determined by the condition that the elsasser number @xmath13 which describes the ratio between the two forces , @xmath14 assumes a value of the order unity ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) .",
    "the counteracting effect of rotation and magnetic field also operates when both , the axis of rotation and the imposed magnetic field , are horizontal , but directed in different direction .",
    "this situation is approximately satisfied in the equatorial region of a rotating spherical fluid shell . for a zonal magnetic field",
    "the onset of convection in this case has been studied numerically by fearn ( 1979 ) . in the closely related configuration of the rotating annulus with decreasing height with distance from the axis analytical expressions for the critical rayleigh number and the associated wavenumber",
    "can be obtained ( busse 1983 ) .",
    "both , the numerical and the analytical results agree quite well and exhibit a minimum critical rayleigh number for @xmath15 .    because of the special role played by the elsasser number in determining the optimal conditions for the onset of convection in the parameter space spanned by the rate of rotation and the imposed magnetic flux density , it seemed obvious that the condition @xmath15 may determine the strength of the observed planetary magnetic fields .",
    "this idea was proposed by eltayeb and roberts ( 1970 ) and it seems to work fairly well in the cases of geomagnetism and jovian magnetism .",
    "but the numerous numerical simulations of convection - driven dynamos in rotating spherical shells have not supported this hypothesis .",
    "first of all , the increase in the size of convection rolls that is the basic reason for the reduction of the critical rayleigh number for @xmath15 is hardly noticeable when convection flows with a dynamo field are compared with flows at the same external conditions , but without a magnetic field .",
    "this has been observed in the work of christensen _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) and is also evident from the streamlines in the equatorial plane shown for different cases in figure [ fig-01 ] .",
    "( the distinction between md- and fd - dynamos will be discussed in section 4 . ) at higher values of the coriolis number @xmath4 some small increase in the scale of convection may be noticed in turning from the non - magnetic to the dynamo state , but this increase could be attributed to the higher amplitude of convection which also influences its characteristic scale .",
    "all figures presented in this paper are original and have been generated from numerical results based on equations given in the appendix .",
    "more details on the dynamo simulations can be obtained from the papers of simitev and busse ( 2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "both the imposed magnetic field with @xmath15 and the magnetic field generated by dynamo action do promote convection and increase the convective heat transport .",
    "the dynamo field accomplishes this mainly by putting the brakes onto the differential rotation which , although generated by the reynolds stresses of convection , exerts an inhibiting influence on the convection eddies through its shearing action .",
    "this nonlinear process is very different from the effect of a nearly homogeneous imposed magnetic field . while the latter enters into the linear terms of the basic equations of motion and thus reduces the rayleigh number for onset of convection , dynamo fields have not shown such an effect .",
    "a typical impression of the effect of the dynamo field can be gained from figure [ fig-02 ] where the azimuthally averaged zonal flow and the local heat transports have been plotted as a function of the colatitude @xmath16 .",
    "these plots demonstrate that the dynamo fields affect primarily the amplitude but not the structure of convection . for the definitions of the nusselt numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 see expressions in the appendix .",

    "dissipation is not only an important part of all dynamical processes such as the dynamo process , but it is also an essential ingredient of most numerical schemes for the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "difficulties can appear when there exist large differences in the various diffusivities entering a problem .",
    "examples are presented by the problem of high rayleigh number convection at very low prandtl numbers when the thermal diffusivity vastly exceeds the kinematic viscosity of the fluid or in the case of the geodynamo when it is attempted to approach the molecular values of the magnetic diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity .    for the simulation of many turbulent systems the molecular diffusivities are far too low to be used in the numerical analysis .",
    "here the concept of eddy diffusivities enters as a convenient solution . on the one hand , it is supposed to provide a representation of the diffusive effects of small - scale turbulence that arises from those components of various fields that can not be resolved numerically . on the other hand ,",
    "eddy viscosities are needed to stabilize numerical schemes .",
    "since small scale turbulence acts in a similar fashion on many physical quantities such as momentum , magnetic flux and temperature it is usually assumed that all eddy diffusivities attain the same value and that as a consequence eddy diffusivity ratios such as the effective ordinary and magnetic prandtl numbers can be set equal to unity .",
    "this procedure can be misleading for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the action of turbulence on a solenoidal vector quantity tends to be different from the action on a scalar quantity .",
    "secondly , large differences in the molecular values of diffusivities are not likely to be entirely eliminated through the effects of turbulence .",
    "the earth s core offers an example for this problem .",
    "the molecular magnetic diffusivity is so large that its replacement by an even larger eddy diffusivity would give rise to magnetic reynolds numbers likely to be below the critical value for dynamo action . from the property that the magnetic diffusivity by far exceeds the kinematic viscosity ,",
    "it can not be concluded that the effective magnetic prandtl number to be used in numerical simulations should be much less than unity . while usual derivations from experimental measurements ( gellert and rdiger 2008 ) and computer simulations ( yousef _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) yield turbulent magnetic prandtl numbers @xmath20 in the range @xmath21 , values in excess of unity have been found ( yousef _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) when the molecular value of @xmath22 was very small . in this respect",
    "the magnetic prandtl number behaves in a similar fashion as the ordinary turbulent prandtl number as discussed , for example , in chapter 12 of the book by kays _",
    "( 2005 ) . in the case of liquid metals , for instance , which are characterized by a prandtl number of the order of @xmath23 , values significantly above unity have been found for the turbulent prandtl number @xmath24 .",
    "it must be kept in mind that eddy diffusivities are just crude tools for the simulation of turbulent transport processes and that a fully satisfactory determination of diffusivity ratios will never be achieved .",
    "considerable efforts have been expended in the development of more advanced concepts of large eddy simulations ( led ) in extension of methods used in non - magnetic turbulence .",
    "we refer to the work of matsui and buffett ( 2005 ) and of matsushima ( 2005 ) . but",
    "these efforts have been only partially successful according to the discussion by roberts ( 2007 ) . in rapidly rotating systems",
    "the use of anisotropic eddy diffusivities could lead to a more realistic description of the effects of small scale turbulence . but",
    "no systematic efforts to determine eddy diffusivity tensors have been made and in view of the doubtful concept of eddy diffusivity it is questionable whether such efforts would be worthwhile .    finally , it should be noted that diffusivities play different roles in different situations .",
    "turbulent ekman layers are not well described by laminar ones with an eddy viscosity replacing the molecular value .",
    "small scale turbulence tends to cancel the effect of the coriolis force and to modify ekman layers into boundary layers more similar to those found in turbulent shear flows in non - rotating systems ( coleman _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) . in a recent paper miyagoshi _",
    "( 2010 ) have numerically simulated convection driven dynamo in rotating spheres with a no - slip outer boundary at the very low ekman number of @xmath25 .",
    "they have come to the conclusion that the results are more similar to those with a stress - free outer boundary than to those with a no - slip boundary together with a more commonly used ekman number of the order @xmath26 or larger .",
    "we thus tend to conclude that the use of a stress - free boundary condition may be more realistic in simulations of the geodynamo than a no - slip boundary with a relatively thick ekman layer attached to it .",
    "in spite of their shortcomings eddy diffusivities and their ratios will continue to be used in numerical dynamo simulations for the foreseeable future .",
    "we have already emphasized the importance of allowing for different values of the various eddy diffusivities .",
    "this importance is amplified by the fact that the properties of turbulent convection driven dynamos seem to vary most rapidly with @xmath27 and @xmath22 in the neighborhood where these parameters assume the value unity .    in the parameter range in which most simulations of convection driven spherical dynamos have been carried out , two basically",
    "different types of dipolar dynamos have been found .",
    "the two types can not be distinguished by their symmetry properties .",
    "only the relative amplitudes of various components of the magnetic and the velocity fields differ greatly .",
    "one type which we shall refer to as md - dynamo is characterized by a dominant axisymmetric dipole which in his ideal manifestation is nearly steady , but which can also oscillate in time , especially if the rayleigh number is not very high .",
    "the other type of dynamo referred to as fd - dynamo is dominated by non - axisymmetric components of the magnetic field with their energy exceeding the energy of the axisymmetric components .",
    "nevertheless outside the conducting spherical shell these dynamos may exhibit a nearly axisymmetric dipole which at lower prandtl numbers may be replaced by a hemispherical or an axial quadrupolar field . for even more dominant non - axisymmetric components the outside field",
    "can sometimes be approximated by an equatorial dipole field .    in this work ,",
    "the symbols md and fd stand for `` mean dipolar '' and `` fluctuating dipolar '' as they are supposed to indicate the dominance of the mean components in the md case while the fluctuating components predominate in the fd dynamos ( simitev and busse 2009 ) .",
    "the md - dynamo is typically realized for prandtl numbers in excess of unity ( simitev and busse 2005 ) . for values of @xmath27 of the order one",
    "it can be generated if the rayleigh number is not too high .",
    "the work of christensen _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) and of kutzner and christensen ( 2002 ) has exhibited quite well the transition from md - type to fd - type dynamos as a function of the rayleigh number . as is emphasized in the latter paper , reversals of the poloidal dipolar field",
    "are only found in the narrow transition region between the two types of dynamos .",
    "this result seems to hold also for the transition region between the two types of dynamos as a function of the prandtl number .",
    "the transition from fd- to md - dynamos with increasing p has also been observed by sreenivasan and jones ( 2006 ) who assumed @xmath28 .",
    "the property that both types of dynamos can exist at the same parameter values over an extended region of the parameter space has been first demonstrated by simitev and busse ( 2009 ) .    for the md - dynamos a description in terms of the magnetostrophic approximation can be applied since the generation of the geostrophic zonal flow by reynolds stresses is nearly suppressed . for detailed formulations of various versions of this approximation",
    "see simitev and busse ( 2005 ) . according to the magnetostrophic approximation the dependence of dynamos on the prandtl number disappears . that this property is approximately satisfied for md - dynamos is evident from figure [ fig-02a ] , where the dependence of the components of the kinetic and magnetic energy densities are plotted as a function of the prandtl number at fixed ratio @xmath29 .",
    "the various energy density components are defined by    [ mdens ] @xmath30    where the angular brackets indicate the average over the fluid shell and over time and @xmath31 refers to the azimuthally averaged component of the poloidal field @xmath32 , while @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 .",
    "analogous definitions apply for the kinetic energy densities as given in with @xmath35 replacing @xmath36 .",
    "non - geostrophic zonal flows of the thermal wind type are usually still present in md - dynamos and are important for the generation of the mean toroidal field from the axial dipole field",
    ".    on the other hand , a geostrophic zonal flow plays an important role in the case of fd - dynamos and as a consequence the energies of the mean poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields are comparable although they are both small in comparison to the energies of the non - axisymmetric fields .",
    "as long as the prandtl number is not too low and the rayleigh number is not too high , fd - dynamos exhibit oscillations of the axisymmetric components of the field ; see , for example , the paper by busse and simitev ( 2006 ) .",
    "these oscillations assume the form of parker s ( 1955 ) dynamo waves propagating from the equatorial plane towards higher latitudes .",
    "the oscillations manifest themselves primarily in the mean toroidal field and sometimes the mean poloidal field participates only in the form of variations of its amplitude without a reversal of its sign .",
    "busse and simitev ( 2008 ) have compared this property with the phenomenon of global excursions of the geomagnetic field which only sporadically lead to a reversal of the earth s dipole .",
    "md - dynamos can also exhibit oscillations , but these manifest themselves just in the amplitude of the various components of the velocity and the magnetic field . at relatively low rayleigh numbers the oscillations are fairly regular with a period of the order of the viscous time scale as shown in figure [ fig-03a ] , while at higher values of @xmath2 they become more irregular .",
    "there is , of course , no sharp boundary between the two types of dynamos and the dependence of such a not well defined boundary on the various parameters of the problem including mode of heating has not yet been investigated in detail .",
    "it appears that fd - type dynamos exist at higher values of @xmath27 when the rotation rate is lowered . on the other hand , md - dynamos tend to exist at lower prandtl numbers when no - slip instead of stress free boundaries are used since the ekman layer tends to damp the geostrophic zonal flow .",
    "other types of dynamos may exist in parameter regions distinct from those that are readily accessible in present computer simulations .",
    "the two types of dynamos can be studied best by direct comparison in the region of the parameter space where they coexist as has been demonstrated in the paper of simitev and busse ( 2009 ) . here",
    "we wish to discuss further properties of the coexisting dynamos . in figure [ fig-03 ]",
    "the parameter range of the coexistence of fd- and md - dynamos has been indicated in the case @xmath37 .",
    "the average magnetic energy density @xmath36 divided by the average kinetic density @xmath35 and the average ohmic dissipation divided by the average viscous dissipation , @xmath38 , are shown as function of the prandtl number @xmath27 ( for fixed @xmath39 and fixed @xmath2 ) on the left side of the figure . on the right side @xmath36 and the nusselt number are shown as a function of @xmath2 ( for fixed @xmath27 and fixed @xmath22 ) .",
    "the averages are defined here as the time average of the spatial average extended over the spherical fluid shell , i.e. @xmath36 is defined as the time average of @xmath40 .",
    "the two types of dynamos differ also in characteristic ways in the energy densities of their components .",
    "these energy densities are highly chaotic as is evident from their time series shown in figure [ fig-04 ] .",
    "because the average energy densities in the two cases are so different , however , even large fluctuations can not push the system from one dynamo attractor to the other .    the plot of the nusselt number @xmath17 as function of @xmath2 in figure [ fig-03 ] demonstrates that the ability of both dynamos to attain the same maximal heat transport of convection is the basic reason for their stability .",
    "at the same time the increase of the magnetic energy density with @xmath2 indicates that the available buoyancy energy rather than a constant elsasser number determines its saturation value .",
    "this finding supports the power laws proposed by christensen and aubert ( 2006 ) .",
    "it is also of interest to see through which terms the various magnetic energy densities are generated . in figure [ fig-05 ] the various terms are shown that are obtained when the @xmath41-component of the equation of induction is multiplied by @xmath31 and by @xmath33 and the @xmath41-component of the curl of this equation is multiplied by @xmath42 and by @xmath43 and the results are averaged over the spherical shell .",
    "following the procedure of simitev and busse ( 2005 ) we list here the most important of those terms in the sequence in which they apply in the case of the md - dynamo of figure [ fig-05 ] ,    [ lorterms ] @xmath44    where the first two letters inside the brackets indicate which of the interactions between velocity and magnetic field components on the right hand sides of the induction equations counteract the ohmic dissipation of the magnetic field component indicated by the last letter inside the brackets .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the averages is that they represent the work done by the lorentz forces on the components of the velocity field described by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    in comparing the md - results with the fd - results it is obvious that axisymmetric md - components require higher contributions than the corresponding fd - components as can be seen from the first and third row of figure [ fig-05 ] .",
    "( note that fd - results of the first through third row have been multiplied by the factor two . )",
    "the fd components have smaller amplitudes and thus suffer less from ohmic dissipation . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - axisymmetric toroidal field is especially strong and thus require higher ( negative ) work done by the lorentz force to balance its ohmic losses",
    ". of particular interest are the cases where the order of the amplitude of contributions given by    @xmath49    for the fd - dynamos in the case of the second and third row of figure [ fig-05 ] differs from the order in the case of md - dynamos .",
    "the axisymmetric components hardly participate in the generation of the non - axisymmetric components of the fd - dynamo . on the other hand the mean toroidal field of the md - dynamo",
    "is mainly amplified by the differential rotation stretching the mean poloidal field as suggested by the @xmath50-dynamo mechanism .",
    "the latter property contrasts with the results of olson _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) who find little evidence for an @xmath51-effect .",
    "this difference can be explained by the damping of the mean zonal flow by the ekman layer at the solid outer boundary which is absent in the case of the stress - free boundary condition used in the present paper .",
    "in this paper we have considered a few assumptions of dynamo theory which are often taken for granted , but which should be questioned . the difference between the effects of an imposed magnetic field and one that is generated by dynamo action is beginning to be appreciated and an elsasser number of the order unity is no longer generally accepted for the determination of the magnetic energy equilibrium .",
    "the concept of eddy diffusivities or of similar methods for representing the effect of unresolved scales of turbulence will be needed for the foreseeable future .",
    "but the ratios of eddy diffusivities should not always be set equal to unity .",
    "variations of these ratios can have a significant influence on convection driven dynamos and may lead to new insights in the interpretation of observed properties of planetary dynamos .",
    "finally the common assumption of unique turbulent attractors should be abandoned and the multiplicity of turbulent states in nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics with its huge number of degrees of freedom should be appreciated .",
    "in contrast to some other cases of bistability such as the one observed in the vks - experiment ( berhanu _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) the states md and fd do not differ in their symmetry properties .",
    "here a brief outline of the mathematical formulation is given which is employed for the simulations of convection driven dynamos referred to in this paper .",
    "it is assumed that a static state exists with the temperature distribution @xmath52 where @xmath10 is the thickness of the spherical shell , @xmath53 is the length of the position vector with respect to the center of the sphere and the gravity field is given by @xmath54 .",
    "in addition to the length @xmath10 , the time @xmath55 , the temperature @xmath56 and the magnetic flux density @xmath57 are used as scales for the dimensionless description of the problem where @xmath58 denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath59 its thermal diffusivity , @xmath60 its density and @xmath61 is its magnetic permeability .",
    "the equations of motion for the velocity vector @xmath62 , the heat equation for the deviation @xmath63 from the static temperature distribution , and the equation of induction for the magnetic flux density @xmath64 are thus given by      where @xmath66 denotes the partial derivative with respect to time @xmath67 and where all terms in the equation of motion that can be written as gradients have been combined into @xmath68 . the boussinesq approximation has been assumed in that the density @xmath60 is regarded as constant except in the gravity term where its temperature dependence given by @xmath69_const _ is taken into account .",
    "the dimensionless parameters obey the definitions except for the rayleigh number @xmath2 which in the present spherical case is defined by @xmath70 because the velocity field @xmath62 as well as the magnetic flux density @xmath64 are solenoidal vector fields , the general representation in terms of poloidal and toroidal components can be employed ,      stress - free boundaries with fixed temperatures are used , @xmath72 where the radius ratio is fixed at the value @xmath73 . for the magnetic field electrically insulating boundaries are assumed such that the poloidal function @xmath32 must be matched to the function @xmath74 which describes the potential fields outside the fluid shell @xmath75 the energy densities are defined by      where the angular brackets indicate the average over the fluid shell and @xmath45 refers to the azimuthally averaged component of @xmath77 , while @xmath46 is defined by @xmath78 .",
