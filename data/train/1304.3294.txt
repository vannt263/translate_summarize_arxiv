    "the scattering of atoms from surfaces has been measured extensively during the past fifty years @xcite . the measured angular distribution for heavy atoms , when quantum diffraction effects may be neglected ,",
    "is characterized by a few prominent , qualitative features .",
    "rainbows appear at sub - specular and super - specular angles in the form of bell shaped maxima in the angular distribution mcclure69,mcclure70,mcclure72 . typically , the intensity of the sub - specular peak is larger than that of the super - specular peak rieder85,amirav87,kondo06 .",
    "other features include a reduction of the angular distance between the rainbow peaks as the incident energy of the atom is increased @xcite or as the angle of incidence ( measured with respect to the vertical ) increases @xcite .",
    "recent reviews of rainbow scattering from surfaces may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an early model which gave a qualitative explanation for the asymmetry in the angular distribution was that of a hard wall corrugated potential steele73,garibaldi75,green78,klein79 .",
    "this model may be solved analytically .",
    "it provides a simple explanation for the rainbows - one readily finds that they originate from the inflection points of the corrugation .",
    "perhaps more subtle but of not less interest is that the hard wall corrugated model also provides an explanation for the asymmetry in the angular distribution .",
    "one finds that the potential which faces the incoming particle leads to the sub - specular peak @xcite .",
    "its intensity is higher just as the intensity of the rain that one feels is larger when one runs into the rain direction rather than away from it .",
    "the hard wall model also provides a partial explanation for the energy dependence of the distance between the rainbow angles .",
    "if one adds a shallow attractive square well which precedes the wall steele73,green78,klein79 , one finds that the distance between the rainbow peaks decreases as the incident energy increases . at low incident energies ,",
    "one `` feels '' the shallow well and due to its refractive effect on the straight line trajectories , it increases the distance between the rainbow angles .",
    "as the energy is increased , the refraction decreases and one reaches the repulsive hard wall limit , in which the rainbow angles are energy independent .",
    "the energy dependence of the angular distance between the rainbows is thus a sensitive measure of the characteristics of the physisorption well .",
    "however , the hard wall class of models is deficient in a number of respects .",
    "for example , the distance between the rainbow angles is independent of the angle of incidence .",
    "the rainbow angles are symmetrically spaced about the specular angle and this is not always so @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not very realistic , since the interaction between atoms and surfaces really is rather `` soft '' especially when dealing with rare gas incident atoms .    with this in mind",
    ", we have developed in recent years a classical theory of atom surface scattering which is based on a perturbation theory in which the corrugation height is considered to be the small parameter miret12,pollak08,pollak09,pollak10a , pollak10b . in previous work",
    ", we developed this theory using a perturbation expansion which is valid to first order in the corrugation height .",
    "the first order theory correctly predicts the incident energy and incident angle dependence of the angular distribution .",
    "the distance between the rainbow angles decreases when the incoming atom has some time to traverse in the horizontal direction , smearing out the effect of the corrugation .",
    "therefore , when the angle of incidence is large , the horizontal velocity is relatively fast and the distance between the rainbow angles is small .",
    "similarly , at a fixed angle of incidence , increasing the energy implies also an increase of the horizontal momentum and this leads to a smaller angular distance between the rainbows .",
    "similar to the hard wall model , if the potential is purely repulsive , then the rainbow angles are energy independent , the energy dependence arises only when the potential includes a physisorption well @xcite . as in the hard wall model , the rainbows are symmetrically placed about the specular angle",
    "the first order perturbation theory does not account for the asymmetry in the angular scattering unless one imposes an asymmetric corrugation potential @xcite .",
    "the topic of this paper is to show how a second order perturbation theory , applied to elastic atom - surface scattering , accounts for the asymmetry in the angular distribution . in principle , the second order theory calls for the solution of a second order in time equation of motion which is characterized by a time dependent harmonic frequency and external force .",
    "such an equation is rather difficult to solve analytically except in special cases .",
    "however , if one uses the fact that energy is conserved during the scattering , one may replace the second order in time equation of motion with a first order in time equation which is readily solved analytically . using this strategy",
    "we derive in section ii the second order perturbation theory expression for the final momenta of the particle .    in section iii we use these results to derive the angular distribution expanded up to second order in the corrugation height .",
    "we find that the second order contribution leads to the correct asymmetry in the angular distribution .",
    "sub - specular final angles have higher intensity than super - specular angles , due to the same qualitative effect already understood from the hard wall model .",
    "the perturbation theory also provides an incident angle and energy dependence for the asymmetry , which decreases as the energy is increased or as the angle of incidence increases with respect to the vertical direction .",
    "moreover , the theory accounts for asymmetry in the location of the rainbow angles with respect to the specular scattering angle .    in section",
    "iv we apply the theory to an exponentially repulsive potential and a morse potential model with a sinusoidal corrugation function .",
    "analytic expressions are derived for the angular distributions in both cases . as in the first order theory ,",
    "the purely repulsive potential gives an energy independent angular distribution .",
    "the energy dependence is directly related to the physisorption well , which is of course included in the morse potential model .",
    "some numerical examples are provided for a simplified model of the scattering of an ar atom from a lif(100 ) surface .",
    "we end with a discussion of the results , noting for example that one may also observe asymmetry in the opposite direction , that is that the super - specular scattering angles are more probable than the sub - specular ones schweizer91 .",
    "we also speculate that the second order perturbation expansion should be useful within a semiclassical description of the scattering .",
    "in this paper , we limit ourselves to a model of in - plane scattering from a frozen surface .",
    "generalization to the full three dimensional dynamics , as well as inclusion of surface phonons is straightforward but leads to somewhat more complicated expressions @xcite .",
    "we thus assume that the scattering event takes place in the vertical ( @xmath0 ) and horizontal ( @xmath1 ) configuration space .",
    "a `` standard '' model used for the description of the scattering is based on the assumption that the potential of interaction depends on the instantaneous distance from the surface and so has the generic form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the small periodic ( with lattice length @xmath4 ) corrugation height of the surface .",
    "the potential vanishes when the particle is sufficiently distant from the surface .",
    "this potential is then expanded to first order in the corrugation height , that is : @xmath5 in principle , since we will develop a second order perturbation theory with respect to the corrugation , one should expand to include also the second order term , however , this does not create any fundamental differences in the results , only leads to a more complicated algebra , so that we will remain with the standard first order expansion for the potential .",
    "we will study the classical scattering for a particle with mass @xmath6 and vertical and horizontal momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",

    "this is also qualitatively consistent with rainbow scattering from a hard wall corrugated potential .",
    "it is also worthwhile noting that when limiting the derivation to only first order perturbation theory ( denoted by the subscript ) then the angular distribution takes the symmetric form @xcite:@xmath89demonstrating clearly that the asymmetry observed in the angular distribution is a second order effect .",

    "we thus find that the second order coefficient is positive at low energies and becomes negative as the energy is increased .",
