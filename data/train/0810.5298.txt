    "we expand significantly on ref .",
    "@xcite , demonstrating in detail the existence of the first - order dynamical phase transition , and discussing the landau - like approach  @xcite that we use to characterise the dynamical phases , and the transition between them .",
    "the dynamical transition we find in kcms @xcite is related neither to a thermodynamic transition , nor to a finite temperature ( or finite density ) dynamical singularity .",
    "our results , therefore , point towards a perspective @xcite on glasses which is distinct from other approaches , such as the random first - order transition theory @xcite , frustration - limited domains @xcite , or mode - coupling theory @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sstates ] we introduce our dynamical tools and the ensemble of histories in which the dynamical phase transition takes place . in section  [ sec : models ] we describe the models that we will consider .",
    "we show the existence of a dynamical phase transition in section  [ sec : results ] comparing different models and establishing minimal conditions that are sufficient to ensure a dynamical transition . in section  [ sec : traj ] we discuss the ensemble of histories in detail , considering statistical properties of the active and inactive phases , and a dynamical analogue of phase separation .",
    "we summarise our results in section  [ sec : concl ] , and consider some open questions .",
    "in this article , we are concerned with fluctuations in dynamical observables such as the amount of dynamical activity in a glassy system , integrated over a long time @xmath1 and over a large ( but finite ) system .",
    "to investigate these fluctuations , we consider statistical properties of the histories followed by the system .",
    "ensembles of histories are central to the thermodynamic formalism developed by ruelle and coworkers  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "while thermodynamics is concerned with probability distributions over configurations of a large system , we will apply the thermodynamic formalism to probability distributions over histories .",
    "we begin by discussing the physical content of the observables that we will consider .    in the boltzmann - gibbs theory ,",
    "the macroscopic features of large systems are characterised by determining the statistical properties ( the mean value and fluctuations ) of extensive observables , such as the energy or the number of particles . in a _ microcanonical _",
    "approach , one considers the properties of a system with fixed total energy @xmath2 .",
    "they are obtained from the counting factor @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the size ( the volume ) of the system . in the large size limit ( @xmath5 )",
    ", we define the entropy density @xmath6 , which represents the relative weight of configurations with energy density  @xmath7 .    in a dynamical context",
    ", we consider histories of the system between an initial time @xmath8 and a final time @xmath9 . instead of considering the statistics of the energy @xmath2",
    ", we will consider an observable @xmath10 , that is extensive in the observation time @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamical analog of @xmath11 is the probability distribution of this observable @xmath12 on a mathematical level , the choice of the observable @xmath10 is somewhat arbitrary , although application of the thermodynamic formalism requires that the quantity @xmath13 should have a finite limit for large times @xmath1 .",
    "subject to this constraint , the choice of the order parameter @xmath10 is informed by physical insight : we should use an observable that reveals the essential physical processes at work in the system .",
    "for example , in non - equilibrium systems in contact with two reservoirs of particles , we might define @xmath10 as the total particle current : the number of particles transferred from one reservoir to the other between times @xmath14 and @xmath1 ( see , for example , refs  @xcite ) . in the context of glassy phenomena ,",
    "we consider observables that measure the `` activity '' or the `` complexity '' of the history  @xcite",
    ".    returning to the boltzmann - gibbs approach , it is useful to define the _ canonical _ ensemble through the partition function @xmath15 which characterises a system at a given temperature @xmath16 . within this framework",
    ", phase transitions can be identified from singularities in the intensive free energy , @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamical analog of this thermodynamic partition sum is @xmath18 where we introduced an intensive field @xmath0 conjugate to @xmath10 .",
    "this field will play a role similar to the inverse temperature @xmath19 .",
    "the dynamical partition function @xmath20 is the central object of ruelle s thermodynamic formalism .",
    "we have focused on the correspondence between the thermodynamic limit of large system size ( @xmath5 ) and the long time limit ( @xmath21 ) in ruelle s formalism . in the following",
    ", we will consider systems for which the large time limit is to be taken at fixed system size : in some cases , we will then take a second limit of large system size @xmath4 .",
    "if we consider systems with no thermodynamic phase transitions , then no singular behaviour arises on taking the limit of large @xmath4 at fixed @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", we expect the limits of large @xmath4 and large @xmath1 to commute , but this is is clearly not the case in general .",
    "we now give more precise definitions of the quantities discussed so far , by reviewing the construction of the ensemble of histories for stochastic systems .",
    "we focus on continuous - time markov dynamics  ( in this section , we follow @xcite ) .",
    "the system is defined by a finite set of configurations @xmath22 .",
    "its dynamical evolution is defined by the rates @xmath23 for transitions from configuration @xmath24 to configuration @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath26 of being in configuration @xmath24 at time @xmath1 evolves according to a master equation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the rate of escape from @xmath24 .",
    "is sufficiently general to describe kinetically constrained models , spin facilitated models , or lattice gases , with @xmath24 representing the configuration of the whole lattice in each case .",
    "starting from a configuration @xmath29 at initial time @xmath30 , the system will experience a fluctuating number of changes of configuration ( `` jumps '' ) between @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "we shall refer to the number of jumps as the `` activity '' and denote it by @xmath31 . a history ( or trajectory ) consists of a sequence @xmath32 of visited configurations , and a sequence of times @xmath33 at which the jumps occur ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_sequence ] ) .",
    "we stress that for a fixed observation time @xmath1 , the number of jumps is a fluctuating quantity : it depends on the particular history followed by the system between @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to histories with many hops ( large @xmath31 ) as ` active ' histories and those with few hops ( small @xmath31 ) as ` inactive ' .",
    "we use the notation @xmath34 for an average of the observable @xmath35 , over histories of the system .",
    "we consider observables that depend on the entire history of the system , through the configurations visited and the time spent in each : that is , @xmath36 . in general",
    ", we have @xmath37     \\exp\\left [ -\\sum_{k=1}^k r({\\mathcal c}_k)(t_{k+1}-t_k ) \\right ]   \\mathcal{o}({\\mathcal c}_0\\dots{\\mathcal c}_k , t_1\\dots t_k)\\ ] ] where the limits on the time integrals are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ; we use @xmath41 to denote the probability distribution of the initial configuration @xmath29 .",
    "we use a compact notation for averages of this form : @xmath42 \\mathcal{o}[\\mathrm{hist}].\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] plays the role of a probability density in the space of histories .",
    "having defined our system and its histories , we now turn to the choice of the time - extensive observable @xmath10",
    ". a simple choice of this observable will be the activity @xmath31 .",
    "each time the system changes configuration @xmath44 the activity @xmath31 is incremented : @xmath45 .",
    "more generally , we can consider an observable @xmath10 that is incremented at each jump , with the increment @xmath46 depending on the configurations before and after the jump .",
    "that is , for a given history with @xmath31 changes of configurations @xmath47=\\sum_{k=0}^{k-1}\\alpha({\\mathcal c}_{k},{\\mathcal c}_{k+1})\\ ] ] again , we note that if @xmath48 then @xmath10 is the activity @xmath31 .    to construct the dynamical partition sum , we start with a ` microcanonical ' approach , classifying trajectories by their values of @xmath10 .",
    "we generalise the probability @xmath26 , defining @xmath49 as the probability of being in configuration @xmath24 at time @xmath1 , having measured a value @xmath10 of the time - extensive variable between @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "its evolution in time is given by the master equation @xmath50    thus , the probability of measuring a value @xmath10 for the observable @xmath10 in a history of length @xmath1 is @xmath51 which we identify as the quantity introduced in  .",
    "we have defined the distribution @xmath52 that is the analog of the microcanonical counting factor @xmath11 .",
    "we now introduce the analog for the canonical ( boltzmann - gibbs ) ensemble , parameterized by a field @xmath0 .",
    "this involves a modification to the statistical weight of each history : @xmath53 \\to   \\mathrm{prob}[\\mathrm{hist } ] { \\text{e}}^{-sa[\\mathrm{hist}]}\\ ] ] thus , in the ` @xmath0-ensemble ' , averages of observables @xmath35 are given by @xmath54 \\mathrm{prob}[\\mathrm{hist } ] { \\text{e}}^{-sa[\\mathrm{hist } ] } =    \\frac{\\langle \\mathcal o\\ , { \\text{e}}^{-sa } \\rangle }    { \\langle { \\text{e}}^{-sa } \\rangle } \\ ] ] where @xmath55 { \\text{e}}^{-sa[\\mathrm{hist } ] }             = \\langle { \\text{e}}^{-sa } \\rangle\\ ] ] is the dynamical partition function , introduced in  .",
    "( the subscript @xmath10 of @xmath56 serves as a reminder that the field @xmath0 is conjugate to @xmath10 . )    averages in the ensemble with @xmath57 correspond to the steady state averages of @xmath58 .",

    "we take the laplace transform of @xmath49 with respect to @xmath10 : @xmath59 from  , the equation of motion for @xmath60 is @xmath61 or , in an operator notation , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 operates in the space of configurations @xmath22 .",

    "we have already defined the function @xmath73 , which is the dynamical analog of the free energy density @xmath74 .",
    "the dynamical analog of the entropy density @xmath75 is @xmath76 which determines the large-@xmath1 scaling of the probability of observing a value @xmath77 for the observable @xmath10 .",
    "for large times , the sum in   is dominated by the maximum of @xmath52 , so that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are are related through a legendre transform : @xmath80 if the function @xmath78 satisfies @xmath81 , it can be obtained from the inverse transform @xmath82    physically , the quantity @xmath78 describes the large fluctuations of @xmath10 .",

    "in addition to time - extensive order parameters of the form given in  , we also consider those of the form @xmath88           = \\sum_{k=0}^{k } ( t_{k+1}-t_k ) b({\\mathcal c}_k )   = \\int_0^t dt'\\ : b({\\mathcal c}(t')),\\ ] ] where we introduced a configuration - dependent observable @xmath89 . in the sum over @xmath90 , we define @xmath91 and @xmath92 so that the time spent in configuration @xmath93 is simply @xmath94 . in the integral representation ,",

    "some connections between @xmath0-ensembles parameterized by observables of types @xmath10 and @xmath97 discussed in appendix  [ app : ab ]      the models considered in this work have dynamics which obey detailed balance with respect to an equilibrium distribution @xmath104 : that is , @xmath105 .",

    "we therefore use a variational principle ( valid for any symmetric operator ) to determine their common maximal eigenvalue : @xmath112 at @xmath57 , the maximum is achieved for @xmath113 , and @xmath72 , as required .",
    "interestingly , the quantity to be maximised in   has a physical interpretation .",
    "for any history of the system , the fraction of time spent in each configuration @xmath24 defines a quantity known as the experimental measure .",
    "as we discuss in appendix  [ app : donskervaradhan ] , donsker - varadhan theory relates the probability of observing a particular experimental measure to an expectation value of the form @xmath114 . in section  [ sec : traj ] , we will use these results to investigate fluctuations in the @xmath0-ensemble .",
    "kinetically constrained models @xcite are simple lattice models of glasses which can account for a large range of dynamical phenomena associated to the glass transition .",
    "this includes : super - arrhenius temperature dependence of timescales , non - exponential relaxation , spatially heterogeneous dynamics , transport decoupling , and aging and memory effects .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of kcms are very simple , and their non - trivial features arise from dynamical rules which forbid or favor some transitions , while maintaining detailed balance with respect to a trivial equilibrium distribution over configurations . for a review on kcms see @xcite .",
    "we first consider models with binary spins @xmath115 where @xmath116 are the sites of a lattice . in spin - facilitated models ,",
    "sites with @xmath117 represent excitations , which promote local activity .",
    "the models evolve by single spin - flips , which occur with rates @xmath118 where @xmath19 is the inverse temperature , and the kinetic constraint enters through the function @xmath119 , which is a function of the neighbors @xmath120 of @xmath121 , but does not itself depend on @xmath122 . in this case , it is simple to verify that the model obeys detailed balance with respect to the equilibrium distribution @xmath123 and that the excitation density is @xmath124 .    in the one - spin facilitated fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model  @xcite , @xmath125 if any of the nearest neighbors @xmath126 of @xmath121 are in the excited state , @xmath127 ; otherwise @xmath128 .",
    "we also consider the three - dimensional variant of the east model  @xcite in which @xmath125 for site @xmath129 if at least one of the sites @xmath130 , @xmath131 or @xmath132 is in the excited state ; otherwise @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , we consider lattice gas models  @xcite , in which particles move from site to site , with at most one particle per site .",
    "sites which are occupied have @xmath117 , and unoccupied sites have @xmath133 .",
    "particles move between sites @xmath121 and @xmath126 with rate @xmath134 so that the model has a conserved density @xmath135 .",
    "the rate @xmath134 is non - zero only for nearest neighbor sites @xmath121 and @xmath126 , and it is independent of @xmath122 and @xmath120 . thus , equilibrium state has a trivial distribution : all configurations with density @xmath136 have equal probability . as an example of such a model , we consider the two - vacancy facilitated triangular lattice gas , or ( 2)-tlg @xcite , which is defined on a triangular lattice , with a constraint @xmath137 which is equal to unity if the two common nearest neighbors of sites @xmath121 and @xmath126 are vacant , and zero otherwise .",
    "similarly , the ( 2,2 ) variant of the kob - andersen ( ka ) lattice model  @xcite is defined on a square lattice , with @xmath138 if at least one neighbour @xmath139 of site @xmath121 has @xmath140 and at least one neighbour @xmath141 of site @xmath126 has @xmath142 .",
    "otherwise @xmath143 .",
    "the construction of the @xmath0-ensemble in section  [ sec : sstates ] assumed that the system of interest has a single steady state to which it converges in the long - time limit . for finite - sized stochastic systems ,",
    "this convergence is ensured as long as the dynamics are irreducible  @xcite : that is , it must be possible for every configuration of the system to be reached from every other configuration .",
    "for kcms , this is not the case in general .",
    "for example , in the fa model , there are no transitions either into or out of the configuration with no excited sites ( @xmath133 for all @xmath121 ) . for the models considered here ,",
    "these states are usually considered to be irrelevant because they have a contribution to the gibbs measure that vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit , at all temperatures @xmath144 .",
    "however , when considering large deviations , these states may become relevant . in order to ensure convergence to a single steady state , we define our unbiased measure over histories as in  , with a distribution of initial conditions @xmath41 that is non - zero only for configurations in the largest irreducible partition of the dynamics .",
    "that is , we do not allow the system to occupy configurations that can not be reached from representative configurations taken from the relevant gibbs ensemble . for the fa model and east models ,",
    "this simply means that the system may not occupy the configuration which has no excited sites .",
    "practically , this means ( for example ) that the maximum in the variational expression   should be taken with the constraint that @xmath145 is finite only for configurations in the largest irreducible partition .",
    "instead of restricting initial conditions in this way , one could instead consider large deviations in a subsystem of size @xmath4 that is embedded in a larger system of size @xmath146 : this was the approach taken in  @xcite .",
    "as usual , we expect these approaches to be equivalent in the limit of large system size @xmath4 .",
