    "a large part of modern physics is devoted to nonlinear classical and quantum phenomena in various systems .",
    "such effects as the generation of the second harmonic or optical rectification are known from classical physics , while quantum electron pumping through a small sample due to interference of wave functions is a quantum nonlinear effect .",
    "experiments on nonlinear electrical transport often combine classical and quantum contributions .",
    "a macroscopic sample without inversion center @xcite exhibits a current - voltage characteristic which with increasing voltage departs from linearity due to terms proportional to the square of the applied voltage .",
    "if now an oscillating ( ac ) voltage is applied , a zero - frequency current ( dc ) is generated .",
    "if the sample is sufficiently small , quantum effects can appear due to the wave nature of electrons .",
    "the uncontrollable distribution of impurities or small variations in the shape of the sample result in quantum contributions to the dc which are random . for a mesoscopic conductor with terminals",
    "@xmath0 we can describe the quadratic current response in terms of second order conductances @xmath1 .",
    "they relate voltages @xmath2 applied at contacts or neighboring gates @xmath3 at frequency @xmath4 to the current at zero frequency at contact @xmath5 , @xmath6 the second order conductances include in detail the role of the shape and the nearby conductors ( gates ) .",
    "they depend on external parameters like the frequency of the perturbation , temperature , magnetic field or the connection of the sample to the environment .",
    "we concentrate here on the quantum properties of nonlinear conductance through coherent chaotic samples .",
    "chaos could result from the presence of impurities ( disorder ) or random scattering at the boundaries ( ballistic billiard ) .",
    "due to electronic interference the sign of this effect is generically random even for samples of macroscopically similar shape .",
    "@xcite when averaged over an ensemble , the second order conductances vanish . as a consequence , for a fully chaotic sample",
    "there is no classical contribution to the dc and the nonlinear response is the result of the sample - specific quantum fluctuations .",
    "interestingly enough , from a fundamental point of view these fluctuations of nonlinear conductance are sensitive to the presence of coulomb interactions and magnetic field .",
    "while interactions strongly affect the fluctuations amplitude , their sign is easily changed by a small variation of magnetic flux @xmath7 , similarly to universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) in linear transport .",
    "more importantly , without interactions the current ( [ eq : iv ] ) through a two - terminal sample is a symmetric function of magnetic field , just like linear conductance .",
    "however , the idea that coulomb interactions are responsible for magnetic - field asymmetry in nonlinear current was recently proposed theoretically @xcite and demonstrated experimentally in different mesoscopic systems .",
    "@xcite ( various aspects of nonlinear quantum @xcite and classical @xcite charge and spin transport @xcite have been discussed later on . )",
    "it is useful to consider ( anti ) symmetric second order conductance @xmath8 defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a combination of voltages at the gates and contacts varied in the experiment and @xmath11 accounts for the spin degeneracy .",
    "we emphasize that , depending on the way voltages are varied , experiments probe different linear combinations of second order conductance elements @xmath1 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : iv ] ) . from now on we will simply call @xmath12 conductances and if no confusion is possible leave out the expression `` second order '' .    in the presence of a dc perturbation",
    "the mesoscopic averages of antisymmetric @xcite and symmetric @xcite conductances vanish , and it is their sample - to - sample fluctuations that are measured .",
    "experiments are usually performed for strongly interacting samples and the magnetic - field components @xmath13 allow one to evaluate the strength of interactions . @xcite in previous theoretical works on nonlinear transport through chaotic dots several important issues have been discussed using random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",

    "@xcite the fluctuations of relative asymmetry @xmath17 and the role of the contact asymmetry on this quantity were discussed in ref .. the results of rmt approach were compared with experimental data of zumbhl @xcite and angers @xcite    previously we considered statistics of @xmath8 for the dots where only one dc voltage was varied .",
    "however , to avoid parasitic circuit effects some experiments are performed varying several voltages simultaneously .",
    "surprisingly , the importance of the chosen combination of varied voltages ( bias mode ) was not addressed before in the literature .",
    "it turns out that an experiment where only one of the voltages is varied @xcite or two voltages are asymmetrically shifted @xcite measure different combinations of nonlinear conductances @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in a weakly interacting dot in the first mode we found that @xmath18 , @xcite but in the second bias mode the fluctuations of nonlinear current are strongly reduced , so that @xmath19 .",
    "it is also important to generalize the previous treatment of the nonlinear current to mesoscopic systems biased by an ac - voltage at _ finite _ frequency .",
    "the resulting dc is sometimes called `` photovoltaic current '' .",
    "we expect that in such mesoscopic ac / dc converters the interactions lead to significant magnetic field - asymmetry in the dc - signal .",
    "the rectification effect of mesoscopic diffusive metallic microjunctions was theoretically considered by falko and khmelnitskii @xcite assuming that electrons do not interact .",
    "therefore , a magnetic - field asymmetry was not predicted and was also not observed in subsequent experiments . @xcite the fact that the interactions induce a magnetic field - asymmetry of the photovoltaic current when the size of the sample is strongly reduced was recently demonstrated in aharonov - bohm rings by angers @xcite    however , it turns out that for an ac perturbation another quantum interference phenomenon , also quadratic in voltage , random in sign and magnetic field - asymmetric , contributes to the dc .",
    "due to _ internal _",
    "ac- perturbations of the sample , the energy levels are randomly shifted and a phenomenon commonly referred to as `` quantum pumping '' @xcite appears .",
    "brouwer demonstrated that two voltages applied out of phase generate pumped current linear in frequency , while a single voltage pumps current quadratic in frequency @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite although theory usually considers small ( adiabatic ) frequencies , a photovoltaic current could be induced by voltages applied at arbitrary frequency . at small @xmath4",
    "the pumping contribution vanishes and only the rectification effect survives .",
    "in contrast , it is not clear what the ratio of pumping current to rectification current is at large @xmath4 . to distinguish between different mechanisms",
    "it is therefore important to consider rectification in a wide range of frequencies in detail .     at the locally applied gate , which slightly changes the shape of the dot (",
    "shown dashed ) , or microwave antenna emitting photons with energy @xmath20 into the dot . bottom : rectification sources include external bias @xmath21 , top gate voltage @xmath22 with capacitance @xmath23 , and parasitic coupling of @xmath24 due to stray capacitances @xmath25 .",
    "microwave antenna can emit photons to the contacts and lead not only to photon - assisted ac transport but also to a rectified dc.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we point here to a crucial difference between rectification and pumping contributions to the photovoltaic effect .",
    "rectification results from external perturbations or the perturbations that can be reduced to the exterior by a gauge transformation .",
    "typical examples are external ac - bias , or gate voltage which shifts all levels uniformly , @xcite or a bias induced by parasitic ( stray ) capacitance which connects sources of possible internal perturbations to macroscopic reservoirs , @xcite see the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : dot ] .",
    "pumping , on the other hand , is due to internal perturbations like those of a microwave antenna @xcite or a locally applied gate voltage , @xcite see the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : dot ] .",
    "internal and external sources affect the schrdinger equation and its boundary conditions , respectively . in experiment",
    "pumping and rectification , often considered together under the name of photovoltaic effect , @xcite are hard to distinguish .",
    "can one clearly separate quantum pumping from rectification effects ? to distinguish them",
    "it was proposed to use magnetic field asymmetry of dc as a signature of a true quantum pump effect . in refs . and",
    "rectification by ( non - interacting ) quantum dot was due to stray capacitances of reservoirs with pumping sources .",
    "the rectified current was found to be symmetric with respect to @xmath26.@xcite while such field - symmetric rectification dominated in the experiments of switkes @xcite and dicarlo @xcite at mhz frequencies , an asymmetry @xmath27 observed at larger ghz frequencies seemed to signify a quantum pump effect .",
    "@xcite it was noted that the coulomb interactions treated self - consistently do not lead to any drastic changes in the mesoscopic distribution of a pumped current.@xcite probably , that is why the effect of interactions on the rectification have not been considered yet , even though the coulomb interaction in such dots is known to be strong.@xcite    however , as it turned out later , coulomb interactions are responsible for magnetic - field asymmetry in nonlinear transport through quantum dots .",
    "@xcite similarly this could be expected for rectification as well .",
    "then the magnetic field asymmetry alone can not safely distinguish pumping from rectification .",
    "therefore we thoroughly examine the frequency dependence of the magnetic - field ( anti)symmetric conductances @xmath8 . here",
    "we neglect any quantum pumping effects and their interference with rectification . @xcite",
    "while the role of coulomb interactions and the full frequency dependence in quantum pumping are yet to be explored , here we answer two important questions concerning a competing mechanism , rectification : ( 1 ) in the dc limit @xmath28 for a strongly interacting quantum dot @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of the same order .",
    "is this also the case at finite frequencies ? ( 2 ) how are the experimental data affected by the bias mode for alternating voltages ?",
    "a number of very recent experiments on nonlinear dc transport @xcite and ac rectification @xcite have used submicron ring - shaped samples with a relatively large aspect ratio . in this work",
    "we develop a model of a ring which includes chaotic dynamics due to possible roughness of its boundary and/or the presence of impurities .",
    "similarly to quantum dots , the two - terminal nonlinear conductance of such a ring is field - asymmetric because field - asymmetry exists in each arm . in particular",
    ", this leads to deviations of the phase in ab oscillations from @xmath29 which characterizes linear conductance obeying onsager symmetry relations .",
    "experiments find that the amplitude and phase of ab oscillations exhibit rather curious properties .",
    "for example , the dc experiment of leturcq @xcite finds that during many ab oscillations with period @xmath30 the phase is well - defined .",
    "the experiment demonstrates that a nearby gate can vary the phase of the ab oscillations over the full circle .",
    "the amplitude of the second harmonic @xmath31 is strongly suppressed . on the other hand ,",
    "the dc experiment @xcite and ac experiment @xcite of angers find that the phase can be defined only for few oscillations at low magnetic fields . for high frequencies ,",
    "the phase fluctuates strongly as function of frequency .",
    "both in the nonlinear and the rectified current the amplitude of the second harmonic @xmath31 in ab oscillations is always comparable with the first harmonic @xmath30 .",
    "this is in contrast with the experiments in ref .. although we do not fully address all these questions here , our model of a chaotic ring allows us to consider them at least on a qualitative level .",
    "to introduce the reader to the problem of nonlinear transport in sec .",
    "[ sec : bias ] we first qualitatively discuss the coulomb interaction effect in the simplest dc problem . in reality the statistical properties of conductances @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iv ] ) are sensitive to electronic interference but to assess the role of coulomb interactions we can consider a specific sample .",
    "in contrast to linear transport , it turns out that the nonlinear current strongly depends on the way voltages at the contacts and/or nearby conductors are varied from their equilibrium values ( bias mode ) .",
    "for example , we find that the experiments when only one voltage at the contact is varied @xcite or when two contact voltages are shifted oppositely @xcite measure different nonlinear currents . indeed ,",
    "for a current @xmath32 , bilinear in voltages , its second derivative should depend on the chosen direction in the space of voltages @xmath33 .",
    "interestingly , a sample with weak interactions is very sensitive to the choice of the bias mode , which we attribute to the strong effect of capacitive coupling of the sample with nearby conductors .    to make our arguments quantitative and",
    "consider the role of magnetic flux @xmath7 for a quantum dot which is ( generally ) ac - biased at arbitrary frequency @xmath4 , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dc ] we take electronic interference into account . having done that , we illustrate the interplay between interactions and interference on several important examples .",

    "[ sec:2terminal ] we find the statistics of ( anti ) symmetric conductances @xmath8 defined in eq .",

    "both @xmath14 and @xmath15 vanish on average .",
    "quantum fluctuations of @xmath15 strongly depend on the interaction strength , circuit asymmetry and bias mode .",
    "this is in accordance with our qualitative picture . on the other hand ,",
    "the antisymmetric component @xmath14 depends only on interactions .",
    "our arguments agree with recent experiments in quantum dots:@xcite depending on the bias mode different features of the nonlinear conductance tensor are probed .",
    "the fluctuations of nonlinear current can be minimized or maximized ( on average ) , which becomes important for weakly interacting electrons .",
    "curiously , for symmetric coupling ( transmission and capacitance ) of contacts and dot the bias mode in which the voltages at the contacts are changed in opposite directions generally _ minimizes _ fluctuations of @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , such a mode is more advantageous for the observation of @xmath14 or a cleaner linear signal . near the end of sec .",
    "[ sec:2terminal ] we also demonstrate how to take into account possible classical circuit - induced asymmetry @xcite due to the finite classical resistance of the wires .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : rectify ] we present results elucidating the role of interaction in rectification through two - terminal dots .",
    "usually there are two important time - scales : the dwell time @xmath34 an electron spends inside the dot and the charge relaxation time @xmath35 of the dot . for a given geometry ,",
    "the dwell time depends on the coupling of the dot with reservoirs , but the charge relaxation time is also sensitive to the interaction strength .",

    "our results qualitatively agree with those in diffusive metallic junctions .",
    "our model of a ring consisting of a chaotic dot with a ballistic arm which encloses an ab flux is presented in section [ sec : phase ] .",

    "another important issue is rectification of ac bias , which is quadratic in applied voltage , random , and asymmetric with respect to the magnetic flux inversion .",
    "the photovoltaic dc current can be due to rectification of external perturbations or quantum pumping by internal perturbations .",
    "both rectification and quantum pumping share the aforementioned properties , and it is important to clearly separate them especially when the frequency of perturbations is high ( nonadiabatic ) .",

    "in addition , we show that recent experiments in chaotic aharonov - bohm rings might be considered similarly to quantum dots .",
    "the multiply connected geometry alone leads to ab oscillations , yet the mesoscopic distribution of their phase is expected to be qualitatively similar to that of @xmath434 in quantum dots .",
    "therefore , the bias mode should strongly affect the shape of mesoscopic distribution of the ab phase .",
    "the model of an ab ring , which we develop , consists of a dot and a long ballistic arm and takes into account both chaos and a ring geometry . as an application of our model",
    "we consider fluctuations of the ab phase .",

    "first we explain what approximations should be made to ensure validity of rmt .",
    "our starting point is the assumption that the @xmath69-matrix of the ring is uniformly distributed over the unitary group .",

    "rmt can be applied to a closed ring if the dimensionless conductance is large , @xmath439 , which is usually satisfied for a weak disorder even if @xmath436 .      an open ring with ballistic contacts of the width @xmath381 gains a new energy parameter , the escape rate @xmath440 , where @xmath64 is the total number of ballistic channels .",

    "the main drop of the potential occurs in the contacts .    if a magnetic field is applied , the rmt is valid if the total flux through the annulus of the ring is much less then the flux quantum , @xmath442 .",
    "due to narrow contacts the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) of the @xmath69-matrix can be broken at a much smaller scale , @xmath443 . since in our rings",
    "@xmath444 , a full crossover to the broken trs can be considered .",
    "how well are these conditions fulfilled in the experiment ? in ref .",
    "chaos was mainly due to diffusive scattering on the boundary and @xmath445 .",

    "therefore , we have a similar estimate for the ratio @xmath451 .",
    "although this ratio is not parametrically large due to , e.g. , weak disorder @xmath452 , we believe that such ab rings still can be assumed zero - dimensional due to their good conducting properties together with relatively narrow contacts .    in our calculations",
    "we make a further simplification by spatially separating chaotic scattering which randomizes the electronic phase and the long ballistic arm attached to it . to find the correlators of the @xmath69-matrix elements we use a simplified model , see fig .",

    "we assume that the size of the dot @xmath454 and the length of the arm @xmath455 are such that @xmath456 to ensure that in the hierarchy of different fluxes the main flux @xmath395 is concentrated in the region embraced by the arm , the flux through the dot @xmath394 is much smaller , but still much larger then the flux through the cross section of the arm .",
    "the amplitude of ab oscillations depends on the width of the arm @xmath457 .",
    "the wider the arm ( relatively to the contacts ) the closer the results should be to a uniformly chaotic ring . for the case",
