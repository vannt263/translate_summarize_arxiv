    "the measured periods and spin down rates of soft - gamma repeaters ( sgr ) and of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) , and the observed x - ray luminosities of axp , indicate that these neutron stars have extremely high magnetic fields , as large as @xmath4 g @xcite . furthermore",
    ", if these sources are the central engine of gamma - ray bursts , as suggested in @xcite , their magnetic field might even be larger .",
    "up to now , about ten highly magnetized neutron stars , the `` magnetars '' , have been identified in our galaxy , but their actual number may be larger , and it has been suggested that a fraction of pulsars ( @xmath5 @xcite ) would possibly become magnetars at some stage of evolution . the discovery of magnetars has triggered a growing interest in the study of the structure , dynamics and evolution of neutron stars with large magnetic fields , and has raised a number of interesting issues .",
    "for example , quasi - periodic oscillations have been detected in the aftermath of the giant flares of sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 , and it is not clear whether they are associated to crustal modes , or to modes of the magnetic field ( or both ) ; if the spacing between the observed frequencies would be explained , one may gain information on the internal structure of the star @xcite .",
    "in addition , magnetars may be interesting sources of gravitational waves , especially if they possess a toroidal magnetic field ; indeed , as suggested by jones and cutler @xcite , a large toroidal component tends to distort the star into a prolate shape , leading to a secularly unstable object : the wobble angle between the angular momentum and the star s magnetic axis would grow on a dissipation timescale , until they become orthogonal .",
    "this may produce a copious flux of gravitational waves , potentially detectable by the advanced version of gravitational wave detectors ligo and virgo @xcite .    in order to understand magnetars structure and dynamics",
    ", it is necessary to model their equilibrium configuration in the framework of general relativity , including both poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components .",
    "toroidal fields should form during the first seconds after core collapse , when the star is likely to be rapidly and differentially rotating : the fluid motion would drag the poloidal field lines creating large toroidal fields @xcite ; in addition , convective motions prevailing in the early life of a neutron star could also create toroidal fields by dynamo processes@xcite .",
    "these toroidal components are expected to survive when the proto - neutron star cools down and the crust forms .",
    "we also stress that large toroidal components contribute to explain the giant flares in current models of sgr s @xcite . in @xcite it has been shown that a purely poloidal magnetic field is unstable , and decays on a timescale much shorter than the star s life ( see also @xcite and references therein , and @xcite ) ; however , as discussed in @xcite , a magnetic field configuration with prevailing toroidal component is also expected to be unstable on a short timescale .",
    "thus , both toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields have to be included to construct accurate , and stable , models of magnetars .    in recent literature , magnetars equilibrium configurations have been studied by solving einstein - maxwell s equations , coupled with the hydrodynamics equations , in full general relativity @xcite . however , the numerical schemes used in most cases require circularity of the space - time , i.e. the existence of two hypersurface - orthogonal killing vectors , and this assumption automatically excludes toroidal magnetic fields , since they break circularity . therefore , in @xcite only poloidal magnetic fields have been considered .",
    "a different approach has been used in @xcite , where equilibrium configurations have been studied using a perturbative techniques , i.e. solving einstein - maxwell - hydrodynamics equations , linearized about a spherically symmetric background , and expanding the perturbed equations in tensor harmonics .",
    "toroidal fields have been included in the analysis only in @xcite , but this work is based on very restrictive assumptions : the magnetic field is assumed to vanish outside the star .",
    "poloidal and toroidal fields have also been considered in the framework of newtonian gravity in a recent work @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we construct equilibrium configurations of neutron stars with strong magnetic fields , in general relativity .",
    "since magnetars rotate very slowly , we restrict to non - rotating stars",
    ". however , rotation can play an important role in the early phases of the stellar evolution , therefore it will be included in future developments of this work .",
    "we follow a perturbative approach , generalizing the work of @xcite to include toroidal magnetic fields , with a magnitude comparable with that of the poloidal fields .",
    "we start solving the relativistic grad - shafranov equation , to which maxwell s equations can be reduced , in the background of a non rotating star ; we impose a set of boundary conditions which correspond to different magnetic field configurations , and construct the corresponding stress - energy tensor .",
    "the magnetic field perturbs the star , which is consequently deformed ; to compute the stellar structure and its deformation , we then solve the einstein - maxwell - hydrodynamics equations linearized about the spherically symmetric background of the non rotating star , having the electromagnetic and the fluid stress - energy tensors as a source .",
    "we compare the deformation induced by a magnetic field with that which would be produced by rotation , and find that effect of magnetic fields is dominant for magnetars as sgr and axp .",
    "we discuss how the magnetic field profile and the corresponding stellar deformation depend on the stellar mass and on the equation of state of the fluid composing the star , comparing different stellar models . in current literature ,",
    "only the @xmath6 multipole of the electromagnetic potential is usually considered . in this paper",
    "we also solve the relevant equations for the @xmath7 multipole .",
    "the main features of the perturbative approach are described in section [ model ] .",
    "the results of the numerical integrations of the relativistic grad - shafranov equation , and of the equations of stellar perturbations , are reported and commented in section [ results ] for different field configurations and different stellar models . in section [ results ] we also discuss the effects of the @xmath7 multipole .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in what follows we shall assume that the magnetized fluid composing the non rotating neutron star can be described within the framework of ideal magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) , i.e. that there is no separation of charge currents flowing through the star .",
    "it should be mentioned that , although this assumption is appropriate inside the fluid core , it may not apply to the stellar solid crust .",
    "the magnetic field , and the deformation it induces on the star , are treated as stationary and axisymmetric perturbations of a spherically symmetric background .",
    "we consider perturbations up to order @xmath8 .",
    "we shall follow the notation and the formalism introduced by konno , obata and kojima in @xcite , generalized to include toroidal magnetic fields .    before proceeding with the perturbative approach , in the next subsection",
    "we shall summarize some general properties of stationary , axisymmetric magnetized stars , which will be useful in subsequent sections .",
    "these properties and their proofs can be found in the literature , but are scattered in different papers @xcite , @xcite ; here we report them in a unified and consistent way .",
    "we consider a stationary , axisymmetric space - time describing a magnetized star , with coordinates @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are killing vectors .",
    "the coordinates @xmath12 can be , for instance , spherical coordinates ( @xmath13 ) , or cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "any stationary , axisymmetric quantity , such as the vector potential or the fluid 4-velocity , are independent of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. : @xmath17 , @xmath18 .    the electric and magnetic field",

    "therefore , the vector potential is @xmath40 the electromagnetic tensor becomes @xmath41 and the magnetic field is @xmath42 since @xmath43 when @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "a possible interpretation of @xmath66 is the following ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "( [ f12c ] ) we find @xmath68 from which we see that the fluid angular velocity @xmath65 has two contributions : the first , @xmath66 , can interpreted as due to the stellar rotation , the second is clearly due to the electromagnetic field .",
    "although this interpretation is purely conventional , since we are considering a non rotating star , we shall assume @xmath69 , and consequently @xmath70 .",

    "the matching conditions we impose at the boundaries are different , and should be considered as an attempt to better approximate realistic boundary conditions .",

    "they coincide only in the case of a constant density star , in the newtonian limit , as shown in chapter 16 of @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that the quadrupole ellipticity is the quantity that should be used to evaluate the gravitational emission of a rotating star ; moreover , it has been used to study the spin - flip mechanism proposed by jones and cutler @xcite .",

    "<S> we find numerical solutions of the coupled system of einstein - maxwell s equations with a linear approach , in which the magnetic field acts as a perturbation of a spherical neutron star . in our study , </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields having both poloidal and toroidal components are considered , and higher order multipoles are also included . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the deformations induced by different field configurations , paying special attention to those for which the star has a prolate shape . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the dependence of the stellar deformation on the particular choice of the equation of state and on the mass of the star . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , for neutron stars with mass @xmath0 and surface magnetic fields of the order of @xmath1 g , a quadrupole ellipticity of the order of @xmath2 should be expected . </S>",
    "<S> low mass neutron stars are in principle subject to larger deformations ( quadrupole ellipticities up to @xmath3 in the most extreme case ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of quadrupolar magnetic fields is comparable to that of dipolar components . a magnetic field permeating the whole star is normally needed to obtain negative quadrupole ellipticities , while fields confined to the crust typically produce positive quadrupole ellipticities . </S>"
