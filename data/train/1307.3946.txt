    "supra - arcade downflows ( sads ) are dark features at the tops of coronal arcades that descend sunward during solar flares @xcite .",
    "they are important because they provide a window into the spatiotemporal evolution of the magnetic reconnection process that releases energy by changing magnetic topology during solar flares .",
    "for example , the standard model of solar flares [ _ e.g. _ , @xcite ] depicts a single monolithic reconnection site , but the burstiness and patchiness of sads suggests that reconnection is patchy and bursty as well .",
    "this suggests reconnection occurs at multiple sites in an extended region rather than along a single line .",
    "there have been many observational studies of sads , also called `` tadpoles '' because of their sinuous shape .",
    "their darkness is due to a lack of emitting particles : they persist in soft x - ray and euv , corresponding to temperatures of @xmath0  k @xcite .",
    "their sunward speed is 45 - 500  km / s , below typical coronal alfvn speeds of 1000 km / s @xcite , though they can be considerably faster @xcite .",
    "they decelerate at @xmath11500 m / s@xmath2 and last a few minutes @xcite .",
    "they are correlated with bursts of hard x - rays , suggesting an association with reconnection at the flare site @xcite .",
    "they are most easily seen in the decay phase of long duration events @xcite , but they begin during the rise phase and persist during hard x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "statistical studies of sads revealed their cross - sectional areas are a few to 70 times @xmath3  km@xmath4 ( a radius of 1 - 4  mm ) , their mean flux is @xmath5  mx , they release @xmath6  erg of energy , and their densities are 5 - 43 times lower than ambient densities @xcite .",
    "they originate at heights of @xmath7  mm and penetrate @xmath8  mm @xcite .",
    "their areas have a log - normal distribution , and their fluxes are consistent with both log - normal and exponential distributions @xcite .",
    "reconnection inflows and outflows near sads were recently observed @xcite .",
    "the explanation of their cause remains under debate .",
    "they were originally thought of as flux tubes contracting under tension after reconnection @xcite .",
    "@xcite support their relation to reconnection outflows . from the side , the whole loop should be visible ; these sad loops ( sadls ) were observed @xcite .",
    "recently , it was argued that sads are not flux tubes themselves , but wakes behind them @xcite .",
    "there have only been a few simulation studies of sads .",
    "seminal studies of flux tubes produced by short - lived patchy three - dimensional ( 3d ) reconnection @xcite in the vein of @xcite reproduced some aspects of sads , including a teardrop - shaped cross section @xcite , deceleration as they reach underlying arcades @xcite , and trailing density voids @xcite .",
    "the evolution of retracting flux tubes were also studied @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that sads are generated by interfering shocks ahead of locations where energy is deposited by reconnection @xcite .    in an avenue of research that may be relevant to sad statistics ,",
    "a vlasov - type equation for plasmoids predicts an exponential distribution of sizes @xcite .",
    "the distribution of plasmoid sizes in resistive magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) was exponential , consistent with observations if corrected for resolution constraints in detecting small sads @xcite .",
    "there are significant unresolved theoretical issues about present interpretations of sads .",
    "for example , if sads are either flux tubes or wakes behind them , why does the ambient coronal plasma not rapidly `` fill in '' the region behind them ? if sads are caused by patchy reconnection , what causes reconnection to start and stop so rapidly ?",
    "we argue that sads are caused by downflowing outflow jets from reconnection that is localized in space but not time , as opposed to isolated flux tubes .",
    "new elements of the present model are ( 1 ) the importance of density stratification of the solar corona and ( 2 ) the role of continuous reconnection as opposed to bursty reconnection in preventing the corona from filling in the region behind sads .",
    "we perform proof - of - principle 2d simulations that verify this mechanism produces sad - like density depletions and show the necessity of density stratification .",
    "we show in 3d simulations that localized reconnection is necessary to keep the outflow jets collimated .",
    "the model is described in sec .",

    "consider a coronal arcade with an overlying vertical current sheet , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig - model](a ) .",
    "when reconnection begins at the current sheet , sunward and anti - sunward outflow jets are formed ; the sunward jet is shown by the vertical ( blue ) arrow .",
    "being relatively high in the corona , the plasma at the reconnection site has a relatively low density because the corona is stratified . the relatively higher density plasma in the underlying arcade is denoted by the shaded region .",
    "since the density scale height for coronal parameters is @xmath9 mm , a jet penetrating 10s of mm sees a significant density change .",
    "the density contrast can become larger as chromospheric evaporation populates the arcade .",
    "the low density plasma penetrates the denser material below , forming a thin region of lower density plasma .",
    "we argue this density depletion is a sad .",
    "this model raises a question about the shape of sads . in standard models of 2d steady - state fast reconnection",
    ", the outflow jet expands outward in the normal direction in petschek - type exhausts @xcite .",
    "a similar expansion for bursty reconnection was described as a snow - plow effect @xcite caused by the retracting flux tube surrounding increasingly more mass .",
    "due to the large length scales between the reconnection site and the looptop , one might expect the broadened jet to create a depletion region wider than seen in observations .",
    "however , it was argued that the snow - plow effect does not occur in 3d localized reconnection if there is an out - of - plane ( guide ) magnetic field because the reconnection expands along the guide field instead of the inflow direction , which accommodates the mass that causes expansion in 2d @xcite .",
    "the guide field during flares has been estimated to be comparable to the reconnecting magnetic field @xcite , so this limit is relevant for solar flares . since the region of the corona in question has a low plasma @xmath10 ( the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure ) ,",
    "the mass is not expected to control the magnetic structure of the reconnection exhaust , so we motivate the result of @xcite solely in terms of conservation of magnetic flux .",
    "consider a recently reconnected flux tube with flux @xmath11 formed by reconnection at an x - line of finite extent @xmath12 in the out - of - plane direction @xmath13 and length @xmath14 in the outflow direction @xmath15 .",
    "just downstream of the x - line , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the reconnected ( normal ) component of the magnetic field . after",
    "the flux tube has convected downstream , the magnetic field in the exhaust is predominantly in the @xmath13 direction , so the flux is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the width of the flux tube in the @xmath20 direction , @xmath21 , so solving eqs .",
    "( [ phizeqn ] ) and ( [ later ] ) for @xmath22 gives @xmath23 regardless of whether reconnection is 2d or 3d , the maximum value of @xmath24 is approximately 0.1 of the reconnecting magnetic field @xmath25 since the normalized rate of fast reconnection is close to 0.1 .",
    "equation [ lyprimeeqn ] shows that the maximum downstream expansion of the exhaust @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath12 . in quasi-2d systems",
    ", @xmath12 is large and the exhaust gets wider with downstream distance . in 3d",
    "localized reconnection , @xmath22 has an upper limit , so the exhaust is collimated . for the present application ,",
    "this implies the density depletion regions formed by finite length x - lines are thin , consistent with observations of sads .",
    "a sketch with a perspective 3d view is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - model](b ) , illustrating the difference between the present model and models with sads as isolated flux tubes or wakes behind them @xcite . in the flux tube model",
    ", reconnection happens for a short time , leading to a single flux tube propagating sunward . in the present model ,",
    "the reconnection is continuous in time , at least long enough for the material ejected sunward to propagate to the looptop .",
    "therefore , reconnected magnetic field threads the entire extent of the depletion region , not just through a single flux tube .",
    "this explains why plasma does not rapidly fill in behind the sad as would occur if it were an isolated flux tube .",

    "this equilibrium should be treated solely as a numerical device to set up a stratified plasma in the outflow direction .",
    "the initial conditions are stratified in the inflow direction , but when reconnection begins , it processes this material and populates the arcade with the high density plasma . when the lower density material convects to the reconnection site , the outflow jet is ejected into a vertically stratified arcade as desired .",
    "first , we show that sad - like depletions occur using @xmath66 for the peak density . as time evolves , the high density plasma initially at the current sheet is corralled into the arcade by reconnection early in the simulation [ fig .",
    "[ fig-2dplots](a ) at @xmath67 . when the lower density plasma reaches the reconnection site , it populates the outflow jet and penetrates the high density arcade [ fig .",
    "[ fig-2dplots](b ) at @xmath68 .",
    "a sinuous plasma depletion is clearly seen .",
    "therefore , reconnection can carve a density depletion into a higher density arcade .    to test the importance of density stratification , simulations with different @xmath51 are performed .",
    "figure  [ fig - density](a ) shows the density in a simulation with @xmath69 instead of 4 .",
    "the white line marks the separatrix ( the outer - most closed field line ) , and the white boxes at the top and bottom denote the x- and o - line , respectively .",
    "a sad - like depletion is clearly present .",
    "panel ( b ) has an initially uniform density ( @xmath70 ) . while a curved structure does appear , it is not a depletion as for @xmath71",
    "therefore , the simulations suggest that density stratification is a key ingredient of sad - like depletions .    based on the results of fig .",
    "[ fig-2dplots ] , one might conclude that a 2d model with density stratification is sufficient to explain sads .",
    "however , we argue there are two reasons the density depletion can not propagate the large distances required to explain sads in 2d .",
    "first , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] , fast reconnection in 2d has an exhaust that expands as in the petschek model , which is inconsistent with the collimated structure of sads .",
    "second , the depletion region in fig .",
    "[ fig-2dplots](b ) stretches the reconnected field so that the field wraps around the front of the jet , producing a backward tension force that slows the jet . in 3d",
    "reconnection with a finite length x - line , both of these problems are fixed .    to see that outflow jets in 2d fast reconnection broaden with distance from the x - line while localized 3d reconnection leads to collimated exhausts as seen in the observations , we present 3d simulations with @xmath59 .",
    "the reconnection outflow @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - locresoutflow](a ) through ( c ) for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the vertical lines are a distance 0.5 from the neutral line .",
    "the jet broadens continuously for the longest x - line simulation in panel ( a ) , which for the present computational domain is essentially a 2d case .",
    "( note , this is true because of the finite size of the computational domain ; 3d effects would be seen if the system was larger in the @xmath15 direction . )",
    "the width of the exhaust remains limited when reconnection is more localized in the @xmath13 direction as in panel ( c ) .",
    "a 3d visualization of the exhaust jets and threading of the magnetic fields for the @xmath75 simulation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig-3d](a ) , which shows that the exhaust is localized in the @xmath20 direction and expands in the @xmath13 direction . unlike in the 2d simulations ,",
    "the reconnected field lines in red threading the exhaust are straight ( which is obscured in the figure but can be seen when the exhaust isosurface in blue is removed ) , which implies there is no backward tension force slowing the exhaust in 3d .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the same data with the exhaust removed and rotated to more clearly see the 3d density depletion in the underlying arcade .",
    "thus , 3d spatial localization of reconnection causes exhaust collimation , a necessary ingredient to explain sads .",
    "we have presented a model with the critical physics for sad formation being ( 1 ) density stratification of the corona so that the outflow jet can carve out a depletion , ( 2 ) reconnection being continuous instead of bursty to prevent the coronal plasma from filling in behind the sad , and ( 3 ) localization of the reconnection site in the out - of - plane direction in order for the outflow jet to remain collimated over the large distances .",
    "proof - of - principle simulations confirm these three basic features .",
    "the present model differs from previous ones in a number of important ways and has a number of appealing aspects because it potentially answers open questions about sads .",
    "previous models suggested sads are a result of spatially localized and temporally bursty reconnection .",
    "it is not clear why reconnection stops abruptly . in the present model ,",
    "sads are localized in space but not in time .",
    "we argue the observed burstiness of sads arises from the abrupt onset of reconnection in disparate spatially localized regions .",
    "a very important question about the interpretation of sads as flux tubes or wakes behind them is why the high density corona does not rapidly fill in behind the descending flux tube . if it did , sads would appear as a descending circle instead of an extended depletion . in our model ,",
    "elongated depletions are a natural consequence of their formation as collimated reconnection outflow jets .",
    "an alternate explanation within the flux tube model has been explored in terms of peristaltic flow @xcite .",
    "@xcite previously discussed the correlation of sads with reconnection outflows , but no clear distinction was made between outflow jets and plasmoids ejected from the reconnection site .",
    "there are outward similarities between the present model and one by @xcite .",
    "these studies used a pressure pulse to emulate the effect of energy deposition from reconnection .",
    "it was argued that shocks and waves generated from the pulse interfere to produce voids .",
    "this occurs even in a uniform plasma , while here the reconnection jet itself carves the sad and requires density stratification . with the exception of @xcite , we know of no previous simulation study to include density stratification .",
    "the present model has similarities to a leading model for low density plasma bubbles propagating earthward in the earth s",
    "magnetotail @xcite , though there are some differences . in both models ,",
    "reconnection jets impinge on a higher density region underlying the reconnection site . in the magnetotail ,",
    "an extended reconnection x - line in the out - of - plane direction forms and breaks up due to interchange into numerous flow channels @xcite . here",
    ", we argue the x - line is spatially localized , leading to a single flow channel . of course",
    ", sad - like depletions in simulations should not be overstated as real sads .",
    "the many similarities to observed sads are qualitative rather than quantitative .",
    "future work will require quantitatively investigating whether the following properties in the simulations agree with observations : sub - alfvnic sunward speed , deceleration , duration , penetration depth , sizes , and energy content .",
