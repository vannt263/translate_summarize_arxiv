    "the measurement of linear polarization of radiation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) presents additional information about the structure of radiation sources and absorbing and scattering regions ( the presence of jets , polar outflows , accretion discs near the agn centres , the existence of dust toroidal clouds and other clouds that scatter light ) .",
    "the polarimetric results are presented in many papers ( see , for example , impey et al .",
    "1991 , goodrich & miller 1994 , smith et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 , 2005 ; marin et al .",
    "2012a , b ; marin & goosmann 2013 ; marin 2014 ; afanasiev et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 ) . in these papers",
    "there are detailed references to the observational data and various models to explain these data .",
    "the important parameter in any explanation is the angle of inclination @xmath1 of the line of sight @xmath2 relative to the normal @xmath3 to equatorial plane of the system related to agn .",
    "note that the @xmath1 - value is determined by various methods which very frequently produce different results ( see the recent review of marin 2016 ) .",
    "the inferences of the innermost structures of agns have been obtained indirectly by rowan - robinson ( 1977 ) suggested that agns are surrounded by dusty tori .",
    "he also gives the suggestion that seyfert-2 galaxies are seen close to edge - on so that the active nuclei are obscured by the tori .",
    "support for this picture came from statistical investigation ( see keel 1980 ) which demonstrated that seyfert-1 galaxies are preferentially seen face - on .",
    "the further importance of the orientation effects was considered in lawrence & elvis ( 1982 ) and de zotti & gaskell ( 1985 ) . since then",
    ", the dusty - torus model has become the standard unified model .",
    "when the optical polarization in continuum in agns was detected ( see dibai & shakhovskoi 1966 and walker 1966 ) , it was initially accepted that this was the optical polarization of synchrotron radiation , since it had high intrinsic polarization .",
    "later ( angel et al .",
    "1976 ) the polarization of balmer lines was discovered , which was similar to the continuum .",
    "after that it was clear that the scattering is responsible for both types of polarization .",
    "a key point here was the lack of variability in polarization , which argues against a non - thermal synchrotron origin ( see becklin et al .",
    "1973 ; knacke & capps ( 1974 ) for ir radiation and antonucci & miller 1985 ; bailey et al . 1988 ; young et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for spectropolarimetry ) .",
    "according to optical classification ( see antonucci 1984 , 1993 ; antonucci & miller 1985 ; lawrence 1987 , 1993 ) , there are two types of seyfert agns which also differ from each other by luminosities and spectra .",
    "while spectra of seyfert-2 galaxies have a single set of relatively narrow emission lines , the spectra of seyfert-1 galaxies have additional much broader components of hydrogen , helium and other lines ( see di serego alighieri et al .",
    "1994 , lal et al .",
    "one of the main reasons for the difference between agn-1 and agn-2 is the different angle of observation .",
    "seyfert-1 corresponds to observation closer to the normal @xmath3 to the equatorial plane .",
    "it is the interesting feature that seyfert-1 agns have mostly relatively small linear polarization @xmath4 and the inclination angle @xmath5 . on the contrary , for seyfert-2",
    "the polarization is larger ( @xmath6 ) and the inclination angle @xmath7 is higher ( see marin 2014 ) .",
    "it is also important that the positional angle for seyfert-1 corresponds to wave electric field oscillations * e * nearly parallel to the symmetry axis ( more accurately parallel to the axis of the radio wave emission ) , and for seyfert-2 the oscillations are parallel to the equatorial plane .    in the review of marin ( 2014 ) various aspects",
    "are discussed : the different methods to estimate the inclination angle @xmath1 and a number of models to explain the observed polarimetric data .",
    "particularly , the 3-component model of agn is discussed in detail . according to this model",
    "there are 3 components - a conical polar outflow of scattering particles with the half - opening angle @xmath8 , a vast dust torus in the equatorial plane and an optically thin ( @xmath9 ) equatorial flow ( see also smith et al .",
    "2002 ; goosmann & gaskell 2007 ) .",
    "according to this model , the scattering of non - polarized radiation from the agn centre on electrons in a cone produces the wave electric field oscillations parallel to the equatorial plane .",
    "on the contrary , the scattering on electrons in the optically thin equatorial flow produces the wave electric field oscillations in the  the line of sight - the axis of symmetry  plane , that corresponds to seyfert-1 observations . the degree of this polarization is proportional to @xmath10 and is not large .",
    "the second reason why seyfert-1 agns have modest polarization degrees is the competition between these two scattering mechanisms with the mutually perpendicular position angles .",
    "it is clear from a physical point of view that in axially symmetric models there can arise positional angles either perpendicular to the symmetry axis or parallel to it .",
    "for this reason the competition can not explain the numerous cases of seyfert agns with intermediate position angles . such cases may be explained in models without axial symmetry ( with the existence of separate scattering clouds , ( see goosmann & matt 2011 and marin et al .",
    "2015 ) , or in axially symmetric models by taking into account the faraday rotation effect ( see , for example , silantev 2002 ; buliga et al .",
    "2014 ) . of course",
    ", both reasons may exist independently .",
    "the presence of magnetic field in jets and accretion discs is apparent in many objects ( see chakrabarti et al . 1994 ; pariev & colgate 2007 ) .",
    "there are many types of jets in agns ( see , for example , blandford 2003 ) both relativistic and non - relativistic ones . up to now various models of jets",
    "appear in literature ( for example , levinson & globus 2016 ) .",
    "the faraday rotation of linearly polarized radiation in jets is studied in detail ( gomez et al .",
    "the core of jet sometimes is assumed to be optically thick ( blandford & konigle 1979 ; the review of blandford 1990 ) .",
    "it is known that the base of jets ( hot corona ) is the source of soft x - ray radiation ( see haardt & maraschi 1993 ; haardt & matt 1993 ) .",
    "far above this region the temperature diminishes and the optical radiation appears .",
    "most frequently the adiabatic expansion of the medium is considered ( blandford 2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "recall that in adiabatic expansion the relation @xmath11 takes place ( landau & lifshitz 1980 ) . here",
    "@xmath12 is the temperature in volume @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is temperature in volume @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the ratio of thermal capacities at constant pressure and volume , respectively . for monoatomic gas @xmath17 and for diatomic gas @xmath18 .",
    "clear that expanding jet ( mostly due to particles acceleration with the distance from the centre which results in the increase of volume @xmath15 ) gives rise to the inequality @xmath19 and consequently @xmath20 .",
    "it is interesting that there are papers ( for example , see wang et al .",
    "2005 ) where the existence of thermal matter in relativistic jets is discussed .",
    "it should be noted that there are numerous seyfert agns with intermediate values of polarization degrees and position angles ( see , for example , table 3 in antonucci 1984 ; table 4 in smith et al .",
    "note , that the aperture effects may cause distortions in both the measurement of polarization degree and the position angles of radiation in agns . in many papers ( see , for example ,",
    "lawrence 1991 ; simpson 2005 ) there exist the modifications of a standard model ( the dependence of molecular and dust torus on luminosity of the central source , the particular distributions of dust grains in torus , and so on ) .",
    "usually one considers optically thick accretion discs ( see shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; pariev & colgate 2007 ) .",
    "it appears that both the optically thin and thick accretion discs really occur in agns .",
    "our objective is to discuss the mechanism for the origin of  negative  polarization by reflection of non - polarized radiation from a jet in optically thick accretion discs .",
    "the integral radiation from the surface of optically thick part of a jet has small degree of polarization ( see next chapter ) .",
    "the thermal radiation from an optically thin jet is non - polarized .",
    "for this reason we consider only reflection of non - polarized radiation in an accretion disc .    for the case of optically thin disc",
    "the problem is simple and corresponds to taking into account the single scattered radiation .",
    "when the incident radiation goes from the central nucleus of a disc the polarization degree of scattered radiation is described by formula ( 26 ) .",
    "this formula corresponds to `` negative '' polarization .",
    "the case of optically thick disc is more difficult for consideration .",
    "so , the optically thick accretion disc is illuminated by unpolarized radiation from a jet and we calculate the reflected radiation from the total surface of an accretion disc going into the line of sight @xmath2 . we demonstrate that this radiation has `` negative '' linear polarization for all inclination angles @xmath1 between the line of sight @xmath2 and the normal @xmath3 to the accretion disc plane . besides of reflected radiation , a telescope detects the radiation directly going from the source .",
    "first we calculate this direct radiation from the optically thick jet ( see ch.2 ) .        for calculating radiation fluxes @xmath21 and",
    "stokes parameter @xmath22 ( here @xmath23 is the angle between the line of sight @xmath2 and direction of jet z , see fig.1 ) we use the well known chandrasekhar s ( 1950 ) results for the intensity @xmath24 and the stokes parameter @xmath25 in the milne problem for atmospheres without absorption @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are cross- sections of absorption and scattering , respectively . for calculating fluxes @xmath29 and @xmath30 of radiation scattered in the optically thick accretion disc the results of the paper by silantev & gnedin ( 2008 ) are used .",
    "the calculations demonstrate that direct radiation from an optically thick jet for @xmath31 has the polarization with electric field oscillations perpendicular to the axis of a jet , and for @xmath32 oscillations occur in the plane ( @xmath33 ) , where @xmath2 is direction to an observer , and @xmath34-axis directed along the jet . but this  negative  polarization is small @xmath35 .",
    "thus , polarization from the optically thick region of a jet for seyfert-1 is positive , and for seyfert-2 is  negative  , just opposite to observations ( see , for example , smith et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the radiation reflected after multiple scatterings from an optically thick accretion disc is  negative  for all angles of emission . for inclination angles @xmath36",
    "this polarization is greater than that for the radiation escaping from an optically thick jet ( the milne problem , see ch.3 ) .",
    "in conclusion we underline that we do not present a new model to explain the seyfert -1 and 2 agns features in full .",
    "our objective is to call attention to a new mechanism of  negative  polarization formation in seyfert-1 agns in optically thick accretion discs .",
    "furthermore , we call attention to the explanation of intermediate position angles in these agns using the faraday rotation effect . we hope that our calculations are applicable to all agns , not only to seyfert agns .",
    "let us introduce the necessary notations : the elemental radiating area on the surface of a jet is proportional to the element of the azimuthal angle @xmath37 : @xmath38 .",
    "the axis z is directed along the jet , the direction to the telescope @xmath2 lies in the plane ( xz ) .",
    "the normal to the radiating elemental area is @xmath3 .",
    "the angle @xmath23 is the angle between the z - axis and the vector @xmath2 .",
    "the vector @xmath2 is a linear combination of the coordinate unit vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( see fig.1 ) :    @xmath41    the normal @xmath3 can be represented as    @xmath42    the cosine of angle between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is as follows :    @xmath43    chandrasekhar s ( 1950 ) intensity @xmath24 [ erg/@xmath44s sr ] and the stokes parameter @xmath25 of the outgoing radiation can be approximated by the expressions :    @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 here @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total flux of outgoing radiation ; the value @xmath50 is the first moment of the function in brackets . in our approximation @xmath51 .",
    "the definition of various moments is given in eq.(21 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath52 determines the degree of linear polarization .",
    "the minus sign in @xmath25 implies that the wave electric vector @xmath53 oscillates perpendicular to the plane @xmath54 .",
    "the stokes parameter @xmath55 .",
    "note that expressions ( 4 ) describe the milne problem in conservative atmosphere with @xmath56 .",
    "let us also remind the reader that the milne problem describes the situation when the sources of non - polarized radiation are located far from the surface of an atmosphere .",
    "a telescope detects the radiation fluxes from areas with the azimuthal angles @xmath57 in the range @xmath58 :    @xmath59 @xmath60    @xmath61    here @xmath62 is the distance to the observed object .",
    "expressions for @xmath63 and @xmath64 take into account the transition of stokes parameters into the telescope s coordinate system ( xyz ) . using the expressions ( 4 ) we obtain :    @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68    the value 0.5@xmath69(erg / s ) is the luminosity of observed part of a jet in the direction @xmath2 . integrating @xmath69 over all directions of the angle @xmath70 ( from @xmath71 up to @xmath72 ) and taking into account that @xmath73 , we obtain the total luminosity @xmath74 of radiating area along all directions :    @xmath75    using this expression , the formula for @xmath69 can be written in the form :    @xmath76    note that the positive sign in @xmath63 corresponds to wave electric field oscillations in the plane @xmath77 ( see fig.1 )",
    "this is the case of  negative  polarization in seyfert-1 agns .",
    "table 1 and fig.2 present the degrees of polarization @xmath78 in percents for a number of angles @xmath23 .",
    "the second line of this table presents the polarization in absorbing atmosphere with @xmath79 .",
    "here we approximated the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 using the paper by silantev ( 1980 ) .",
    "note that the calculation of angular distribution and polarization degree is connected with exact solution of characteristic equation and the solution of the system of nonlinear equation for h - functions .",

    "the calculations in our paper demonstrate that the  negative  polarization of radiation from seyfert-1 agns , corresponding to wave electric field oscillations in the plane @xmath54 ( the line of sight @xmath2 - the normal to accretion disc @xmath3 ) , can be explained not only in the model with an optically thin accretion disc ( or equatorial flow ) but also when the accretion disc is optically thick .",
