    "blazars , a common term used for flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacertae objects , appear to be the most energetic types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in these objects",
    "the dominant radiation component originates in a relativistic jet pointed nearly towards the observer .",
    "the double - peaked spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is attributed to a population of relativistic electrons spiraling in the magnetic field of the jet .",
    "the low energy peak is due to synchrotron emission and the second , high energy peak is often attributed to inverse compton scattering of low energy photons in leptonic emission models @xcite .",
    "models based on the acceleration of hadrons can also sufficiently describe the observed seds and light curves @xcite . for most fsrqs and a large fraction of bl lacertae objects ( namely lbls ) the low energy peak",
    "is located in the energy range between submillimeter and optical . on the other hand",
    ", for most of the sources detected to emit vhe @xmath3-rays ( hbls ) the low energy peak is located at uv to x - rays energies @xcite .",
    "the high energy peak is typically at mev",
    " gev energies .",
    "blazars are highly variable in all wavebands and the relation between variability in different bands is a key element in discriminating between different models .",
    "the magic collaboration is performing target of opportunity observations of sources in a high flux state in the optical and/or x - ray band .",
    "optically triggered observations have resulted in the discovery of vhe @xmath3-rays from mrk  180 @xcite and 1es  1011 + 496 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the results of observations of s5  0716 + 714 in november 2007 and april 2008 .",
    "the observation at the latter date resulted in the discovery of vhe @xmath3-rays from the source as announced in @xcite .",
    "the bl lac object s5  0716 + 714 has been studied intensively at all frequency bands .",
    "it is highly variable with rapid variations observed from the radio to x - ray bands ( wagner et al .",
    "it has therefore been target to several multiwavelength campaigns , the most recent one organized by the glast - agile support program in july - november 2007 @xcite . due to the very bright nucleus , which outshines the host galaxy ,",
    "the redshift of s5  0716 + 714 is still uncertain .",
    "the recent photometric detection of the host galaxy @xcite suggests a redshift of @xmath6 which is consistent with the redshift @xmath7 determined by spectroscopy for three galaxies close to the location of s5  0716 + 714 @xcite . in the sed of s5  0716 + 714",
    "the synchrotron peak is located in the optical band and is , therefore , classified either as lbl @xcite or as ibl @xcite    s5  0716 + 714 was detected in the mev energy range several times at different flux levels by the egret detector on board the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite . in 2008",

    "we present the first detection of vhe @xmath3-rays from s5  0716 + 714 .",
    "it is the third optically triggered discovery of a vhe @xmath3-ray emitting blazar by magic .",
    "the magic ( major atmospheric gamma - ray cherenkov ) telescope is a standalone imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope located on the canary island of la palma .",
    "magic has a standard trigger threshold of 60gev for observations at low zenith angles , an angular resolution of @xmath10 on the event by event basis and an energy resolution above 150gev of @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    the tuorla blazar monitoring program @xcite monitors s5  0716 + 714 on a nightly basis using the kva 35 cm telescope at la palma and the tuorla 1meter telescope .",
    "at the end of october 2007 ( 22th , mjd=54395 ) the optical flux had more than doubled ( from 19mjy to 42mjy ) in less than a month and , according to a predefined criteria magic was alerted . due to moon and weather constraints",

    "the magic data were analyzed using the standard analysis chain as described in @xcite . in order to suppress the background showers produced by charged cosmic rays , a multivariate classification method known as random forest",
    "is used @xcite . for every event , the algorithm takes as input a set of image parameters , and produces one single parameter as output , called hadronness .",
    "the background rejection is then achieved by a cut in hadronness , which was optimized using crab nebula data taken under comparable conditions .",
    "the cut in @xmath14alpha@xmath14 that defines the signal region was also optimized in the same way .",
    "an additional cut removed the events with a total charge of less than 200 photoelectrons ( phe ) in order to assure a better background rejection .",
    "we used standard cuts in hadronness and @xmath14alpha@xmath14 , which are determined to give the best significance for a point - like source with a flux on the 10% level of the crab nebula flux .",
    "for the given cuts and the relatively large zenith angles of the observations the analysis threshold corresponds to 400gev .",

    "most of the signal comes from the 2008 data sample : the analysis of the 2008 data alone results in 176 excess events over 422 background events corresponding to @xmath2 . from the 2007 data alone an excess corresponding to @xmath19",

    "no significant variability is seen on time scales shorter than 6 months .",
    "given the limited effective exposure times these observations are not sensitive to variability on shorter time scales .",
    "the individual magic points would have low significance , and an intra - night variability by a factor of at least ten would have been required to detect it . in the optical band , instead , a clear variability on time scales from days to months is visible with two distinct flares : the first in october 2007 , and the second in april 2008 ( fig .",

    "the data point at @xmath22tev has a significance below 1@xmath13 and was , therefore , converted into an upper limit corresponding to a 95% confidence level",
    ". the measured spectrum can be well fitted by a simple power law ( with the differential flux given in units of tev@xmath23 @xmath24 s@xmath23 ) : @xmath25 the errors are statistical only .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are estimated to be 0.2 on the photon index and 30% on the absolute flux level . due to the energy - dependent attenuation of vhe @xmath3-rays with low - energy photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the vhe @xmath3-ray flux of distant sources is significantly suppressed .",
    "we calculated the deabsorbed , i.e.  intrinsic , spectrum of s5  0716 + 714 using an ebl model of @xcite and assuming a redshift of @xmath7 . the resulting intrinsic spectrum ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , red points ) has a fitted photon index of @xmath26 , which is well within the range of other extragalactic sources measured so far .",
    "as the source redshift is still uncertain , we used the magic spectra to calculate upper limits to the redshift .",
    "we assumed two different maximum values for a possible hardness of the intrinsic spectrum : 1.5 , being a canonical value for a @xmath3-ray spectrum emitted by electrons with a spectral index of 2.0 ; and 0.666 , being the limiting case for a @xmath3-ray spectrum emitted by a monoenergetic electron distribution . using the method described in @xcite we obtain the following upper limits for the redshift : @xmath27 ( for an assumed intrinsic spectrum with a power law photon index of 1.5 ) and @xmath28 ( for an assumed intrinsic spectrum with a power law photon index of 2/3 ) .",
    "both limits agree with the redshift determined from the host galaxy detection ( @xmath29 ) and from the spectroscopy of 3 nearby galaxies ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "magic observed the blazar s5  0716 + 714 in november 2007 and april 2008 , the observations resulting in the discovery of a very high energy @xmath3-ray excess with a significance of @xmath30 . during the november 2007 magic observations the average optical flux was @xmath31mjy , while in april 2008 the optical flux was @xmath32mjy .",
    "the same trend is also visible in the magic data : the flux in april 2008 is significantly higher than in november 2007 .",
    "this seems to support the indication seen in previous magic observations for other bl lac objects @xcite , that there is a connection between optical high states and vhe @xmath3-ray high states .    in april",
    "2008 s5  0716 + 714 was also in a historical high state in x - rays @xcite and the optical polarization angle started to rotate immediately after the optical maximum had been reached @xcite .",
    "however , the radio flux at 37 ghz did remain at a quiescent level ( a. lhteenmki , priv.comm ) .",
    "this energy dependent behavior is very similar to the one seen in bl  lac in 2005 , which was attributed to an emission feature moving in a helical path upstream of the vlba core @xcite .",
    "the high vhe @xmath3-ray flux of s5  0716 + 714 observed by magic might originate from such a moving emission feature , but a more detailed study of the multiwavelength light curves from spring 2008 are needed to confirm this .",
    "we tried modeling the sed with a one - zone synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) model with relativistic electrons following a smoothed broken power law energy distribution ( see @xcite for a full description ) .",
    "the fit parameters are : the minimum electron energy @xmath33 , the break energy in the electron spectrum @xmath34 , the maximum electrom energy @xmath35 , the electron spectral index below and above the break energy @xmath36 , @xmath37 , respectively , the magnetic field @xmath38 , the normalization factor @xmath39 , the radius of the emitting region @xmath40 and the doppler factor @xmath41 . to account for the observed tev flux corrected for intergalactic absorption the model ( continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) predicts a high intensity peak in the 10gev range . although the source was flaring in optical at the time of the magic detection , such high @xmath3-ray flux ( more than 10 times larger than observed by egret and fermi , open blue bow - tie in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) appears somewhat implausible .",
    "therefore , we also considered the emission from a structured jet , modeled as a fast `` spine '' surrounded by a slower moving `` layer '' @xcite .",
    "photons emitted by the layer are subject to ic scattering by the relativistic electrons of the spine thus introducing an additional contribution to the ic spectrum at energies higher than ssc can reach .",
    "the computed model is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "the gev excess is substantially reduced and the spectral shape in the @xmath3-ray domain is consistent with the spectral indices measured at both gev and tev energies , though with presumably different intensity states .",
    "the discovery of high flux of vhe @xmath3-rays by magic from the blazar s5  0716 + 714 in april 2008 should be compared to detailed light curves from other wavelengths ( radio , optical and x - rays ) as well as vlba maps and optical polarization light curve in order to further investigate the origin of this interesting event .",
    "we would like to thank the instituto de astrofisica de canarias for the excellent working conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma . the support of the german bmbf and mpg , the italian infn and spanish micinn is gratefully acknowledged .",
