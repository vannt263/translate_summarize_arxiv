    "when a system is embedded in a space of nonzero curvature , its long - distance properties , such as the thermodynamic quantities and the critical behavior , are strongly modified .",

    "genuine long - distance properties on the other hand are accessible in hyperbolic spaces characterized by a constant negative curvature .",
    "the influence of the negative curvature of hyperbolic space on critical phenomena has been investigated both for hard spins on hyperbolic lattices@xcite and in a continuum field - theoretical description@xcite .    in brief , the presence of an intrinsic characteristic length associated with the metric makes the critical behavior of ising - type systems mean - field - like@xcite and drastically alters , if not suppresses , critical points in models with a continuous symmetry@xcite in the last decade , the thermodynamics of simple fluids in the hyperbolic plane has also received special attention .",
    "this is the case for systems interacting through the coulomb potential , such as the one- and two - component plasma models@xcite and for the hard - disk fluid@xcite .",
    "in addition to being a mathematical curiosity and providing simple systems for studying the influence of space curvature on long - distance properties , fluids in the hyperbolic plane have been considered in the context of jamming phenomena and glass formation in liquids .",
    "the rationale behind this comes from the concept of `` geometric frustration '' that describes an incompatibility between the preferred local order and the tiling of the whole space@xcite .",
    "geometric frustration has emerged in the theoretical description of glasses and amorphous solids from the consideration of local icosahedral order in metallic glasses .",
    "no such frustration however operates in assemblies of monodisperse spherical particles in ordinary ( `` flat '' ) two - dimensional space , and nelson and coworkers@xcite have proposed to curve two - dimensional space in order to introduce frustration and thereby mimic glasses in three - dimensional space .",

    "we have studied by molecular dynamics simulation the slowing down of the dynamics with decreasing temperature in a monatomic liquid : a truncated lennard - jones model in the hyperbolic plane@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we provide a consistent statistical - mechanical treatment for describing the thermodynamics and the structure of fluids embedded in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : gener - viri - equat ] , we introduce the statistical - mechanical framework for systems in the hyperbolic plane . by using a variant of the green - bogoliubov method",

    "[ sec : coulombic - systems ] , we focus on coulombic systems , such as the one- and two - component plasma models .",
    "we apply the formalism developed in the previous sections to two cases for which the pair correlation functions are known exactly : the limit of high temperature and a special value of the temperature . in section [ sec : short - range - potent ] , we present the numerical solution of standard approximate integral equations of liquid - state physics ( namely , the percus - yevick and hypernetted chain equations ) that have been obtained after making use of the harmonic analysis in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we consider the hard - disk fluid and the ( truncated ) lennard - jones liquid and compare with existing simulation data .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our concluding remarks , and some technical details are provided in two appendices .",
    "for an atomic liquid at equilibrium in the grand - canonical ensemble ( fixed temperature @xmath0 , total area @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath2 ) , the partition function is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pair potential with @xmath5 the appropriate interatomic geodesic distance ( for simplicity , we only consider pairwise additive interactions ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the partition function of a single particle , _ i.e. _ the ideal gas contribution .",
    "the above expression is valid for any two - dimensional space with @xmath8 the appropriate infinitesimal surface area .",
    "it therefore applies as well to the hyperbolic plane , with however some subtelties that are discussed below .",

    "the boundary contribution of course depends on the boundary condition imposed on the system , but it is never negligible compared to the bulk contribution .",
    "this is already true for the ideal - gas limit .",
    "the canonical partition function @xmath21 is proportional to the total area @xmath1 ; however , the proportionality constant is not a pure bulk property and depends on the type of boundary condition@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are only interested in the _ bulk _ behavior of fluids in @xmath9 , which is what can be directly compared to fluids in euclidean space . one way to eliminate unwanted boundary effects in @xmath9 is to consider periodic boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "this has been done for instance by modes and kamien for calculating the properties of a gas of hard disks in the low - density limit near ideal behavior@xcite .",
    "we shall take here a simpler route that has already been followed in previous studies of spin and field - theoretical models in hyperbolic geometry@xcite : we implicitly restrict all integrals appearing in any statistical - mechanical expression to the `` bulk '' of the sample , _",
    "i.e. _ the fluid far enough from the boundary .",
    "all resulting thermodynamic and structural quantities will therefore be dubbed `` bulk '' ones .",
    "we stress again that the present problem associated with the thermodynamic limit in hyperpolic geometry is a general one which is not related to the presence of long - range correlations between particles .",

    "this requirement prevents using any interaction potential with an algebraic decay , contrary to the @xmath53dimensional euclidean case where all potentials @xmath54 with @xmath55 lead to a well - defined thermodynamic limit ( for the coulombic interaction , see below ) .",
    "the above condition is of course satisfied for hard disks , but also for the one- and two - component plasma models because , as will be discussed later , the coulomb potential decreases exponentially fast at large distance in the hyperbolic plane .    in the case of hard disks , after introducing the auxiliary function @xmath56 , we can express the pressure as @xmath57 and using @xmath58 finally leads to @xmath59 at low density , the radial distribution function at contact @xmath60 goes to one , so that one recovers the virial expansion in eq .",

    "in liquid - state theory , approximate integral equations are a standard tool to describe the structure and the thermodynamics of a system .",
    "the approach is based on the ( exact ) ornstein - zernike equation that relates the radial distribution function @xmath46 , or more precisely the so - called pair correlation function @xmath61 , to the direct correlation function @xmath62 which is obtained from the second functional derivative of the grand potential with respect to local density fluctuations@xcite . in the hyperbolic plane",

    "common approximations are the percus - yevick ( py ) and hypernetted chain ( hnc ) closures in which the direct correlation function is taken as@xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 .    in euclidean geometry and for hard spheres , the py closure ( the direct correlation function is then zero beyond @xmath31 ) is amenable to an analytical solution in spaces of odd dimensions@xcite and compares rather well with computer simulation results .",
    "recently , a semi - analytical solution of the py integral equation has also been obtained in two - dimensional euclidean space@xcite : the first ten virial coefficients have been calculated and compared to monte carlo results .",

    "due to the approximations involved in the integral - equation approach , going from the structure of the fluid to its ( bulk ) thermodynamic properties depends on the route chosen .",

    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , but also through the compressibility relation or that for the excess internal energy@xcite .",
    "for instance , the compressibility relation reads @xmath70 where again only bulk contributions are considered .    at this point",
    ", it is important to stress a peculiar feature of the fourier - helgason transform : contrary to what occurs in euclidean space , @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , by using the results of appendix a , one finds that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a legendre function of the first kind ( conical function ) . as a consequence , the bulk compressibility in @xmath9",
    "is not given by the @xmath74 value of the fourier - helgason transform of the pair correlation function .",
    "on the other hand , neglecting the boundary effects , one still has @xmath75 so that the bulk pressure can be obtained by a thermodynamic integration according to @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the direct correlation function at the density @xmath78 .    for the hard - sphere fluid in euclidean space ,",
    "the percus - yevick integral equation provides a very accurate equation of state when the pressure is calculated with the following empirical rule@xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the `` compressibility '' and `` virial '' pressures obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) , respectively .    note finally that according to eq .",

    "a gas - liquid critical point with a diverging compressibility may thus occur with a pair correlation function that decreases exponentially as @xmath84 .",

    "the above expression diverges when @xmath89 . if @xmath36 is a regular function of @xmath0 and @xmath78 when @xmath90 , this suggests that the critical behavior found near to @xmath91 is of mean - field type , with classical exponents .",
    "in particular , the bulk compressibility @xmath92 would diverge as @xmath93 , implying that the critical exponent @xmath94 .",

    "( [ eq : neq ] ) ) , and has a regular expansion in @xmath98 when @xmath99 .",
    "the expected mean - field nature of the gas - liquid critical point in @xmath9 has the very same origin as the mean - field character of the critical point of the ising model in hyperbolic geometry@xcite : the divergence of the compressibility / susceptibility is controlled by the exponential growth with distance of the differential surface area associated with the hyperbolic metric .",
    "an approximate description of the gas - liquid critical behavior will also be provided in section [ sec : trunc - lenn - jones ] .",
    "we now consider systems of particles interacting through a coulomb potential , as was done before by jancovici and coworkers@xcite . for a monodisperse system ( particles with equal charges of the same sign ) , it is necessary to add a charged uniform background such that the global electroneutrality is satisfied , thereby allowing a proper thermodynamic limit . in the limit of point - like particles , this corresponds to the one - component plasma model ( ocp ) . when considering a binary mixture of two species of oppositely charged particles ( with charges @xmath100 ) in equal concentrations , it is possible to obtain a well - defined thermodynamic limit without introducing a charged background : in the limit of point - particles , this is the two - component plasma model ( tcp ) . in this latter case ,",
    "the system is stable at high temperature , down to a temperature at which a collapse of pairs of opposite charges occurs . when the charged particles have an additional hard - core interaction and at low charge density , the system undergoes a kosterlitz - thouless transition at a lower temperature @xmath101@xcite .",
    "the coulomb potential is formally defined as the solution of the poisson equation , which is related to the green s function of the following inhomogeneous laplace equation : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the laplacian operator and @xmath104 the dirac distribution in the appropriate manifold . in the euclidean plane and for a function depending on the radial coordinate only , @xmath103 is given by @xmath105 and the solution of eq .",

    "we shall consider the two models introduced above , the ocp and the tcp .",

    ", even the coulomb potential that ( logarithmically ) increases with distance in two - dimensional euclidean space is found to decay exponentially in the hyperbolic plane with an intrinsic screening length which is provided by the radius of curvature @xmath14 . as for the @xmath180 term , it is merely a convenient way to mimic a steeply repulsive potential between atoms and its algebraic character has no physical foundation .    to preserve a proper thermodynamic limit in @xmath9 ,",

    "this cut - off procedure is anyhow most often employed in the euclidean case in order to save computer time , and this will facilitate the comparison between the results in euclidean and hyperbolic planes . in the euclidean plane , glandt@xcite has obtained the numerical solution of the py and hnc integral equations for the lennard - jones interaction potential . in this case , the hnc equation becomes significantly more accurate than the py equation as the density increases .",
    "( a comparison with simulations has been performed in ref.@xcite . )    in the present work , we have numerically solved both the py and hnc integral equations for a large range of temperature and density . as in the case of the hard - disk fluid , we observe a very small evolution of the structure with the curvature and the differences between the py and hnc closures are very small too up @xmath182 ( curves not worth showing here ) .",
    "we first focus on the region of density and temperature close to the gas - liquid critical point .",
    "a simple iterative procedure ( picard method ) is then inefficient for converging towards the solution of the integral equation .",
    "it is necessary to proceed with a more sophiscated iterative scheme .",
    "we have combined the newton method with a conjugate gradient procedure@xcite ( which avoids the operator inversion otherwise present in the newton method@xcite ) .",
    "we have adapted this method to hyperbolic geometry .",
    "details are given in appendix b.    we illustrate these results for the py closure and a reduced curvature @xmath183 .",

    "the inverse of the susceptibility reaches a minimum at each temperature and the successive minima approach zero as one gets closer to the critical point .",
    "figure  [ fig:7]a displays the pair correlation functions at a reduced temperature @xmath184 for several area fractions ; the log - linear plot clearly indicates that the decay is always exponential and faster than @xmath84 ( dotted straight line ) .",

    "we have formulated a statistical - mechanical treatment for describing the thermodynamics and the structure of fluids embedded in the hyperbolic plane , focusing on the bulk behavior .",
    "we have applied the formalism to the one- and the two - component plasma models , the hard - disk fluid and the ( truncated ) lennard - jones liquid model .",
    "the negative curvature of space provides an intrinsic length that screens the long - distance behavior of the pair correlations : this is observed both for the coulombic interactions and for the vicinity of the gas - liquid critical point .",
    "the formalism correctly reproduces the known results in the appropriate limits and , via approximate integral equations and exact thermodynamic relations , it leads to predictions that compare well with existing simulation data .",
    "a major motivation for studying liquids in the hyperbolic plane comes from the theoretical description of jamming phenomena and glass formation in terms of geometric frustration .",
    "frustrated local hexagonal order in negatively curved space provides a simple model to study the glass transition . among the many theories proposed for explaining the glass phenomenology , several attribute the slowing of relaxation with decreasing temperature to the presence of a very large number , actually exponential in the system size , of metastable states of low energy or free energy@xcite .",
    "techniques borrowed from spin - glass theory such as the replica formalism have been applied to liquid models in three dimensions to check for the existence of such a multitude of metastable states , and evidence has been provided within mean - field - like liquid - state approximations@xcite . since in some sense , the hyperbolic metric induces in statistical systems some features of mean - field models , one may wonder whether a glassforming liquid in the hyperbolic plane such as the truncated lennard - jones model also possesses a complex free - energy landscape at low temperature .",
    "the integral - equation approach developed in the present formalism can be combined with the replica method to address this point .",

    "finally , by using an exact mehler - fock transform , we illustrate the result given in eq.([eq : neq ] ) : the fourier - helgason transform of a given function @xmath194 when @xmath212 is not equal to the integral of this function in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we consider @xmath213 . with the change of variable @xmath214 , the integral of @xmath194 is obviously equal to @xmath215",

    "the second - order expansion of eq.([eq:40 ] ) is equal to @xmath218 apart from the limiting case @xmath219 , the integral over the whole space is different from the fourier helgason transform at @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , the function @xmath220 has a definite integral only when @xmath221 , whereas the fourier - helgason transform at @xmath74 is defined for @xmath222 .",
    "we also note that the coefficient of the second order in the expansion in @xmath223 is always negative for @xmath222 .",
    "for solving integral equations , the basic method is an iterative procedure , known as the picard method , which can be easily adapted to systems in the hyperbolic plane as follows : starting from an initial value of @xmath224 , @xmath225 is obtained by using the closure equation , eq.([eq:15 ] ) for py or eq.([eq:16 ] ) for hnc .",
    "we next perform the mehler - fock transform of @xmath225 . from @xmath226 , and using eq.([eq:14 ] ) , we calculate @xmath227 through the ornstein - zernike equation , namely , @xmath228 finally , we transform back @xmath227 to obtain a new function @xmath229 . the solution is taken as a barycenter of @xmath230 and @xmath231 , namely @xmath232 where @xmath233 is a mixing parameter .",

    "the number of points in real and reciprocal space was equal to @xmath237 , and integration was performed with a simpson rule . in regions of the phase diagram , far from the coexistence curves and the freezing transition line , the above procedure converges rapidly .",
    "however , in the vicinity of the critical point , the picard method exhibits extremely slow convergence and a newton method is more appropriate for solving integral equations .",
    "in addition , the equations of the newton method are not solved by a direct inversion of the associated operator ( or of the large matrix obtained after discretization of the functions ) , but by a more efficient procedure , the conjugate gradient methods@xcite : it consists in solving the equations by using an iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix ( or an operator ) .",
    "the derivation of the method is done below for the py closure , but it can be easily modified for the hnc closure .",
    "after differenciating eq.([eq:14])and ( [ eq:15 ] ) , and letting @xmath220 denote the mayer function , the equations involved in the newton method are then given by @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 are solutions of the newton equations .    by taking the fourier - helgason transform of eq.([eq:42 ] ) , one eliminates @xmath241 and one obtains an equation of the form @xmath242 where @xmath1 is an operator such that @xmath243 and @xmath244 is given by @xmath245    the adjoint operator @xmath246 is given by @xmath247 where @xmath248 denotes the convolution product .    in order to solve the linear system , eq.([eq:43 ] ) , the solution is built on a sequence of functions in mutually conjugate directions .",
