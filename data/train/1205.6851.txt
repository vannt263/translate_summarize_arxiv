    "the recent breakthrough in 2-dimensional ( 2d ) critical phenomena , referred to schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) , has provided us with a new interpretation of the traditional conformal field theory ( cft ) and coulomb gas approaches . according to schramm s idea @xcite one can describe the interfaces of 2d critical statistical models via a stochastic growth processes in which statistical models fall into one - parameter classes labelled by a diffusivity parameter , namely @xmath5 .",
    "the examples of statistical models which are described by sle are ising model @xcite , potts model @xcite , @xmath6 model @xcite , abelian sandpile model ( asm ) @xcite etc .",
    "and some geometrical models such as self avoiding walks @xcite , percolation @xcite , loop erased random walk ( lerw ) @xcite etc .",
    "this description focuses on some non - local objects in the statistical models , in contrast to cft in which one deals with local fields .",
    "these non - local objects can be interfaces of statistical models , be it the boundary of clusters in ising model , or the boundary of avalanches in asm , or loops in @xmath6 model . +",
    "a very crucial step towards understanding sle was taken by d. bernard et .",
    "@xcite to connect this theory to cft .",
    "they found a simple relation between the diffusivity parameter @xmath5 in sle and the central charge @xmath7 in cft .",
    "this connection helps to conjecture a cft universality class for a less - known statistical model , having its diffusivity parameter ( numerically or theoretically ) and vice versa .",
    "one generally hopes to have some operators in the cft content , corresponding to each sle - observable in the statistical model in hand with a specific @xmath5 .",
    "the examples are crossing probability and left passage probability ( lpp ) @xcite .",
    "the inverse of this statement is also true , i.e. statistical observables ( such as lpp ) can be used to obtain the diffusivity parameter of the model in hand .",
    "in fact the most reliable methods to obtain @xmath5 for a generic critical statistical model lies within these analysis s such as the winding angle distribution and lpp of the sle curves .",
    "lpp of chordal sle can be expressed in terms of @xmath5 within schramm s formula @xcite .",
    "this probability is the solution of a differential equation obtained by conformal invariance of the probability measure of the growing sle curve .",
    "sle(@xmath0 ) is a variant of sle(@xmath5 ) in which there are some more preferred points on the boundary , affecting the growth process of the sle curve .",
    "the relation of this generalization of sle to cft and its operator content and also its correspondence to the coulomb gas is widely studied @xcite . since in some models",
    ", we deal with the interfaces which have these preferred points at the boundary of their domain , the calculation of the statistical observables for sle(@xmath8 ) seems to be crucial in calculating the diffusivity parameter of the them . as an example",
    ", one can mention the statistics of the avalanche frontiers , defined in abelian sandpile model ( asm ) in presence of a sink point in which the grains dissipate .",
    "it is numerically known that these avalanche frontiers , when there is no dissipation , are sle(@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "when in some point on the boundary the grains dissipate , the statistics of these frontiers change so that they are not necessarily ordinary sle and may be analyzed within other variants of sle . in this paper",
    "we analyze the lpp of such curves with some preferred points on the boundary which are described by sle(@xmath0 ) and especially present the results for the case mentioned above i.e. abelian sandpile model ( asm ) in presence of a sink point .    in the next section",
    "we briefly introduce sle and its variant sle(@xmath0 ) .",
    "sections [ lpp ] and [ lpp2 ] are devoted to the lpp of the sle(@xmath4 ) and the more general case sle(@xmath0 ) . in section [ num ]",
    "we present the results for the case @xmath1 and @xmath2 for large @xmath3 at which the boundary condition changes .",
    "sle theory describes the critical behavior of 2d statistical models by focusing on their geometrical features such as their interfaces .",
    "these domain walls are some non - intersecting curves which directly reflect the status of the system in question and are supposed to have two properties : conformal invariance and the domain markov property .",
    "sle is the candidate to analyze these random curves by classifying them to the one - parameter classes sle@xmath9 . for good introductory review",
    "see references @xcite .",
    "there are three kinds of sle ; chordal sle in which the random curve starts from zero and ends at infinity , dipolar sle in which the curve starts from and ends at the boundary and radial sle in which the curve starts from the boundary and ends in the bulk . in this paper",
    "we deal with chordal and dipolar sles .",
    "let us denote the upper half - plane by @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the sle trace grown up to time @xmath12 .",
    "sle@xmath9 is a growth process defined via conformal maps which are solutions of stochastic loewner s equation : @xmath13 in which the initial condition is @xmath14 and the driving function @xmath15 is proportional to a one dimensional brownian motion @xmath16 i.e. @xmath17 in which @xmath5 is the diffusivity parameter defined above .",
    "@xmath18 is defined as the time for which for fixed @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the hull as @xmath21 .",
    "it is notable that the complement @xmath22 is simply - connected so that one can conclude that every point which is separated from the infinity by the sle trace will be involved in @xmath23 .",
    "the map @xmath24 is well - defined up to time @xmath25 .",
    "this map is the unique conformal mapping @xmath26 with @xmath27 as @xmath28 known as hydrodynamical normalization .",
    "there are three phases for sle traces ; for @xmath29 the trace is non - self - intersecting and it does not hit the real axis ; in this case the hull and the trace are identical : @xmath30 .",
    "this is called `` dilute phase '' . for @xmath31 , the trace touches itself and the real axis so that a typical point is surely swallowed as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this phase is called `` dense phase '' . finally for @xmath34",
    "the trace is space filling .",
    "there is a connection between the first two phases : for @xmath35 the frontier of @xmath36 , i.e. the boundary of @xmath37 minus any portions of the real axis , is a simple curve which is locally a sle@xmath38 curve with @xmath39 , i.e. it is in the dilute phase @xcite .",
    "the crucial question about the connection between sle and cft has been addressed by m. bauer et.al .",
    "@xcite in which it was shown that the bcc operator in cft corresponding to the change of boundary condition at the point from which the sle trace starts or ends , is the operator having null vector at second level with conformal weight @xmath40 and the central charge @xmath41 .",
    "this observation helps us to construct the cft correspondence of the observables in sle as we will see in the following sections .",
    "as above , we define sle(@xmath0 ) in the upper half plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 , as was defined above , identifies the local properties of the model in hand , and the parameters @xmath42 has to do with the boundary condition changes ( bc ) imposed on the points on the real axis @xmath43,@xmath44, ... ,@xmath45 ( except the origin from which the curve starts ) .",
    "for example , in the radial set up of sle ( with no further changes on the boundary ) , we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the planar curves start from the origin and end on one point on the real axis ( we name it as @xmath48)@xcite .",
    "the stochastic equation governing such curves is the same as formula ( [ loewner ] ) but the driving function has a different form : @xmath49 the example is the radial sle in which the driving function obeys the following equation@xcite : @xmath50 thus for the radial sle ( from real axis to itself ) , or for chordal case with some other preferred points on the real axis , the corresponding driving function acquires a drift term . for review see the references@xcite .    in determining the operator content of cft of these models ,",
    "the important feature is that the conformal weight of the bcc operators of each preferred point is obtained from a simple relation i.e. @xmath51@xcite .",
    "we will use this in the following sections in order to determine the conformal weight of the probabilities .",
    "in this section we consider the probability of the event that a point @xmath53 lie to the right of a sle curve i.e. @xmath54 in which @xmath55 is the detection point and @xmath56 is its complex conjugate and @xmath57 is the point from which the sle trace starts and @xmath58 is the point at which the curve ends .",
    "this probability has been calculated for the chordal case**???**. the fig [ [ sample ] ] schematically shows the situation . to proceed ,",
    "we introduce the coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 , indicated in the figure as follows :    , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . ]",
    "@xmath63    the use of these coordinates will facilitate the equations , as we will see in following .",
    "in this section we try to obtain the differential equation governing the probability @xmath54 corresponding to ( the lpp of ) sle(@xmath64 ) by using its invariance under conformal mappins . in this case",
    ", we should use the eq [ [ driving ] ] to obtain the change of @xmath54 under the evolution of sle trace and demand that ( the ensemble average of ) this function be invariant under such an operation : @xmath65\\ ] ] in which @xmath55 and @xmath56 is its complex conjugate and @xmath66 [ ] is the ensemble average .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain the final differential equation resulting from the ito calculations :    @xmath67 p(w,\\bar{w},\\xi_0,x^\\infty)=0 \\end{split } \\label{final_lpe}\\ ] ]    it is obvious that this equation has the symmetry under transformation @xmath68 , re[@xmath69@xmath70 re[@xmath69@xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "so one can easily check that in this equation @xmath73 , ( @xmath74re[@xmath69 ) . to proceed , we need to predict the form of @xmath54 . in the next subsection we will see that using conformal field theory ( cft ) , we can reduce the eq [ [ final_lpe ] ] to a single - variable differential equation and relate it to the chordal one .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have introduced the equation governing left passage probability . as this equation",
    "depend on three independent variable , it seems difficult to solve it . in this section",
    "we study the cft interpretation of this quantity .",
    "suppose that @xmath75 is an operator which detects the left passage of sle trace , i.e. the lpp is the expectation value of this operator in cft content to the underling model . as we have boundary conformal field theory ( real axis ) with two boundary changing operators ( one in @xmath57 and another in @xmath61 ) , the lpp can be written as :    @xmath76    in this equation , the operator @xmath77 is the image of @xmath78 with respect to the real axis .",
    "@xmath79 is the boundary changing operator for the cft corresponding to the underling sle whose conformal weight is @xmath40 with second level null vector : @xmath80 leading to the following equation for the corresponding correlation function : @xmath81 with @xmath82 the above sum is over each field in the correlation function [ [ corr ] ] except @xmath57 .",
    "substituting eq [ [ f_dif ] ] in eq [ [ corr ] ] yields the equation : @xmath83 f=0 . \\label{lpe}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath84 is conformal weight of @xmath75 .",
    "it is notable that this equation can be written in terms of @xmath61 in which one exchanges the rule of @xmath57 and @xmath61 .",
    "the chordal case can be obtained in the limit @xmath85 . in this limit",
    "we have @xmath86 in eq [ [ f_dif ] ] and : @xmath87 f=0 . \\label{lpe2}\\ ] ] comparing the eq [ [ lpe ] ] with the equation of lpp of the chordal case @xcite , one obtains @xmath88 . substituting @xmath89 from eq [ [ f_dif ] ] into eq [ [ lpe ] ] , it easy to check that the equation governing @xmath90 is the same as eq [ [ final_lpe ] ] .",
    "it is known that the global conformal symmetry can fix four point functions up to a function of the crossing ratios @xcite . in this case , letting @xmath88 we have : @xmath91^{\\frac{-1}{3}h_1(\\kappa)}[(x-\\xi_0)^2+y^2]^{\\frac{-1}{3}h_1(\\kappa)}g(\\kappa,\\eta,\\bar{\\eta})\\\\ & = \\left ( \\eta\\bar{\\eta}\\right)^{\\frac{-1}{3}h_1(\\kappa ) } g(\\kappa,\\eta,\\bar{\\eta})\\equiv \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\eta+\\bar{\\eta } \\right ) h(\\kappa,\\eta,\\bar{\\eta } ) .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{fpf}\\ ] ] in the above formula @xmath92 is the crossing ratio i.e. @xmath93 and @xmath94 is its complex conjugate .",
    "so the finding of @xmath90 reduces to finding @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96re@xmath97=\\frac{x(x - x^{\\infty})+y^2}{yx^{\\infty}}$ ] ( we set @xmath98 ) .",
    "after some calculations one obtains : @xmath99 in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath100 is equal to @xmath101 .",
    "the solution of this equation , with the boundary conditions @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 is :    @xmath106    this result can be derived directly from chordal case ( the @xmath107 limit , or equivalently @xmath108 ) . in this case",
    "it has been proved that @xcite : @xmath109 the corresponding probability for the dipolar sle can be obtained using the map @xmath110 . under this map , @xmath111 .",
    "the probability that the point @xmath62 is swallowed by a sle curve in the dipolar case , is equal to the probability of left passage of the same point in the chordal set up i.e. the left passage probability of the mapped point @xmath112 . using this point",
    ", one can write : @xmath113 which is exactly the same as eq [ [ efpf2 ] ] ( setting @xmath98 ) .",
    "in this section we apply the cft formalism developed in the previous section to the more general case sle(@xmath8 ) .",
    "lets consider a curve growing from origin to infinity , conditioned by a change in value of fields on the boundary which correspond to a scaling operator on this point with the weight @xmath114 ( it is proved that this curve is a sle(@xmath8))@xcite .",
    "so the left passage probability equals to a five point function in the corresponding conformal field theory :    @xmath115    in this regard , the problem reduces to the calculation of 3-point and 5-point functions which satisfy the boundary conditions . as above",
    ", we define @xmath116 the numerator of the r.h.s . of eq [ [ lpp - cft ] ] .",
    "so we have :    @xmath117    using the null vector equation for @xmath79 and after some calculations we obtain the following equation for @xmath89 :    @xmath118}{(x_0-\\xi_0)^2}\\right\\rbrace   p=0 \\label{lpp - sle(kr)}\\ ] ]    using global conformal invariance , one can fix @xmath89 up to a function of crossing ratios and prove that :    @xmath119^{-\\frac{1}{3}h_1+\\frac{1}{6}h_{\\rho } } \\left [ \\left ( x - x_0\\right)^2+y^2 \\right]^{\\frac{1}{3}h_1-\\frac{1}{2}h_{\\rho } } \\left ( x_0-\\xi_0\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}h_1+\\frac{1}{2}h_{\\rho}}y^{\\frac{1}{3}h_1+\\frac{1}{6}h_{\\rho}}g(\\eta_1,\\eta_2 ) \\label{lpp - cft3}\\ ] ]    in which we have considered two independent crossing ratios @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it would be more convenient to work with the dimensionless variables @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath90 can be written in the following form :    @xmath124    from the above formula , one realizes that all coefficients can be absorbed in @xmath125 and so @xmath90 would be a function on @xmath126 and @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 .",
    "now one can apply the eq [ [ lpp - sle(kr ) ] ] to the eq [ [ lpp - cft4 ] ] , writing the derivatives in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath129 , the following differential equation for @xmath90 is obtained :    @xmath130 h=0 \\label{lppe}\\ ] ]    where : @xmath131\\left(\\frac{1+b}{a}\\right)^2\\\\ \\end{split } \\label{def_coef}\\ ] ] the boundary conditions of the eq [ [ lppe ] ] are as follows :    @xmath132    it is notable that in the limit @xmath133 , the eq [ [ lppe ] ] becomes : @xmath134 which is exactly the eq [ [ efpf ] ] in which @xmath135 , so the requirement of the last line of eq [ [ bndry - cond ] ] is confirmed .",
    "since it s hard to solve eq [ [ lppe ] ] in the general form , this section is devoted to analysis of this equation for the special case @xmath1 and @xmath2 for large @xmath3 ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "one of the most important examples of this case is the abelian sandpile model with a sink on the boundary@xcite . in this model",
    "the boundary condition changing ( bcc ) operator corresponding to the change from open to close boundary condition , is the twisting operator @xmath137 with the conformal weight @xmath138 .",
    "it has been proved that in the scaling limit , the operator corresponding to a sink on the boundary , results from operator product expansion ( ope ) of two twist operators , which is @xmath139 with the conformal weight @xmath140 in which @xmath59 and @xmath141 are grassman variables , living in the ghost action in @xmath142 cft .",
    "this operator is the logarithmic partner of the identity operator @xmath143 .",
    "let us define @xmath144 . in the limit @xmath145",
    ", @xmath146 becomes equal to @xmath147 which is a small quantity and we take it as the perturbation parameter . setting @xmath1 and @xmath2 in eq [ [ lppe ] ] , to first order of @xmath148 , one obtains :    @xmath149p=0 . \\label{reduced - lpp}\\ ] ]    we expect @xmath90 not to be singular in the defined domain , so we can expand it in terms of @xmath146 . in the first order of @xmath148 we have : @xmath150 the above ansatz is the only answer satisfying the following conditions ; in the limit @xmath145 or @xmath151 it retrieves the @xmath152-free solution ( lpp of sle(@xmath153 ) ) as expected . other candidates for the coefficient of @xmath154",
    "are excluded by the similar arguments . substituting this into eq [ [ reduced - lpp ] ] , to the leading order",
    "we obtain ( @xmath155 ) : @xmath156 from the above we can conclude that @xmath157 is exactly the solution of eq [ [ efpf ] ] , i.e. eq [ [ efpf2 ] ] .",
    "so @xmath154 should be the solution of the following equation : @xmath158 with the boundary conditions @xmath159 .",
    "the general solution of eq [ [ p1 ] ] is : @xmath160 in which @xmath161 and @xmath162 are some coefficients to be determined by boundary conditions .",
    "the solution eq [ [ p1sol ] ] satisfies the expected boundary conditions . @xmath161 and @xmath162 should be determined by the condition @xmath163 which is beyond our analysis . therefore to first order of @xmath148 we suffice to present the general solution of eq [ [ reduced - lpp ] ] : @xmath164",
    "in this paper we have calculated the left passage probability for sle(@xmath8 ) for @xmath47 and general @xmath152 . as an example",
    ", we have presented the results for the case @xmath1 and @xmath2 at large @xmath3 ( @xmath3 is the point on the real axis at which the boundary conditions change ) . for this case",
    "we found the lpp , up to 2 unknown parameters existing in the solution which should be fixed from the general solution including the boundary conditions at @xmath165 ( @xmath163 and @xmath166 ) keeping @xmath167 and @xmath168 fixed .",
