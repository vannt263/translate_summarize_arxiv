    "galaxies in rich clusters are subject to a range of environmental processes ( stripping , suffocation , harrassment , tides ) which are absent , or at least less efficient , in the field and in poor groups .",
    "the role of these effects in `` quenching '' star formation in cluster galaxies has been widely discussed based on instantaneous star - formation tracers such as  emission .",
    "for example , the fraction of star - forming galaxies is supressed out to @xmath33 times the virial radius @xmath5 ( e.g. lewis et al . 2002 ) . to trace the history of environment - driven quenching in today s galaxy clusters ,",
    "high quality spectroscopy is needed to determine the final epoch of star - formation in now - passive galaxies .",
    "a number of works have claimed to observe significant variation in absorption line strengths of galaxies , as a function of radius in clusters ( e.g. guzmn et al .",
    "1992 ; carter et al .",
    "2002 ; smith et al .",
    "these trends have been interpreted as a radial gradient in average stellar age .",
    "smith et al .",
    "note evidence that dwarfs may exhibit stronger radial dependences than the more massive galaxies , as expected if the efficiency of the quenching process depends on the depth of the potential well binding the gas reservoirs .    in this letter , we provide further evidence for strong cluster - centric gradients in age for dwarf galaxies ( median @xmath6 ) in coma , using new spectroscopic data from the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the stellar populations will appear in a future paper ( smith et al .",

    "the instrument deploys 300 fibres over a 1deg diameter field of view ( corresponding to 1.75mpc at coma ) ; the fibre diameter is 1.5arcsec ( 0.7kpc ) .",
    "two fields were observed , one centred on the cluster core , and an outer field to the south - west ( figure  [ fig : samplesky ] ) .",
    "the choice of the south - west field was motivated by available supporting data , and influenced by the work of caldwell et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who reported a high fraction of balmer - strong galaxies in this region .",
    "our observations were made in parallel with an extensive redshift survey of the cluster ( hornschemeier et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . to study the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies , we observed 79 known cluster members with luminosities @xmath10mag below @xmath11 , plus ten brighter galaxies for overlap with previous studies ( e.g.  et al .",
    "the target galaxies were selected to lie close to the red sequence of non - star - forming galaxies ( figure  [ fig : samplecmr ] ) .",
    "the 270linemm@xmath12 grating was used , resulting in a wide wavelength coverage ( 37009000 ) at a spectral resolution of 4.5 , fwhm .",

    "relative flux calibration was imposed using f stars with photometry from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , adelman - mccarthy et al .",

    "analysis of the one - dimensional spectra , including combination of multiple exposures and measurements of emission and absorption lines , followed methods used by smith , lucey & hudson ( 2007 ) .",
    "three galaxies with  in emission ( equivalent width @xmath1320 ) were removed from the sample .",
    "no other galaxies have emission above @xmath30.5  after removing the stellar continuum .",

    "comparisons with the index measurements of  et el .",
    "( 2006 ) show excellent agreement for eight galaxies in common ( e.g.  offset @xmath14  with rms scatter 0.2 ) .",
    "line strength measurements can be transformed into estimates of stellar population age and element abundances , through comparison with population synthesis models . in this letter , we analyse the absorption line measurements with reference to new stellar population models by schiavon ( 2007 ) . advantages of this model set include its basis in a flux - calibrated stellar library , individually variable mg , c , n and ca abundances at fixed fe / h , and a publicly - available code  for estimating parameters from measured indices ( graves & schiavon 2008 ) .",
    "the  code performs an iterative `` sequential '' grid inversion , finding abundance ratios which yield consistent age and metallicity estimates across a range of index ",
    "index diagrams .",
    "a full description of the method is given by graves & schiavon ( 2008 ) , while a summary can be found in schiavon ( 2007 ) .",
    "in our implementation , an initial estimate of age and fe / h is made using  and the iron indices fe5270 and fe5335 assuming solar - scaled abundances .",
    "the mg / fe ratio is adjusted to yield the same metallicity and age from  and mgb5177 .",
    "similarly , c / fe is obtained using the fe4668 index ( which is heavily inflenced by the c abundance ) . with c",
    "/ fe in hand , the n / fe abundance is adjusted for consistency with the measured cn2 . finally , ca / fe is obtained from ca4227 .",
    "the procedure is iterated , deriving a new age and metallicity estimate from the updated abundance pattern in each step . once the final abundances are obtained , ages are estimated using the higher - order balmer indices  and , as well as using .",
    "errors are determined from monte carlo simulations .",
    "in this section , we examine the evidence for trends in our sample of coma dwarfs , both at the level of observed indices and also using the derived ages and metallicities . because the stellar populations of red galaxies follow strong scaling relations with the mass or luminosity ( e.g. smith et al . 2007 ) , we analyse the residuals from the index  luminosity ( and age  luminosity relations , etc ) , rather than the index data themselves .",
    "thus we are comparing the inner and outer galaxy population at fixed luminosity .",
    "( in fact , there is no correlation of luminosity with radius within our galaxy sample , so similar results would be obtained without this control . ) we exclude the brighter comparison galaxies ( with @xmath15 ) , and one object for which  failed to converge , leaving 75 galaxies in the fits .",
    "all galaxies are assigned equal weight in the fits , since the scatter is primarily intrinsic and the measurement errors similar for all points .    the residual index ",
    "radius relations are shown in figure  [ fig : radtrends_ix ] , for the nine indices which enter into our analysis with .",
    "strong positive correlations are observed in all of the balmer indices :  ( 5@xmath16 ) ,  ( 4@xmath16 ) , and  ( 4@xmath16 ) .",
    "negative , but generally less significant , trends are recovered for the metal indices dominated by light elements : cn2 ( 3@xmath16 ) , mgb5177 ( 3@xmath16 ) , ca4227 ( 2@xmath16 ) .",
    "finally , the carbon - dominated index fe4668 and iron - dominated fe5270 and fe5335 show no significant correlation .",
    "figure  [ fig : radtrends_ez ] presents the equivalent relations for the derived age ( estimated from each balmer index , and the average age ) , the metallicity fe / h and the four light - element abundance ratios ( mg / fe , c / fe , n / fe , ca / fe ) .",
    "we find a strong ( 5@xmath16 ) correlation towards younger ages at larger radii , whether measured with ,  or .",
    "the size of the effect is consistent between age indicators . using the average of the three ages obtained for each galaxy , the age ",
    "radius correlation is significant at the 6.5@xmath16 level , and its slope implies a factor of two change in age , per degree in radius . the median age for the galaxies beyond 0.4deg from the centre is 3.8gyr , corresponding to their star - formation being quenched at @xmath17 ( figure  [ fig : radquench ] ) .    the iron abundance",
    ", fe / h shows a significant ( 2.7@xmath16 ) correlation @xmath18dexdeg@xmath12 , with higher metallicity at larger radius .",
    "( note that the absence of a trend in fe5270 , for example , reflects the compensating effect of the age and fe / h gradients . )",
    "the mg / fe abundance ratio is significantly smaller at large radius by @xmath19 dexdeg@xmath12 .",
    "note that the magnesium abundance [ mg / h ] = [ mg / fe ] + [ fe / h ] is consistent with being independent of location in the cluster ; thus the variation in [ mg / fe ] is driven by the greater iron abundance in the outer galaxies , not by lower magnesium .",
    "the other abundance ratios are also smaller at larger radius , but with lower significance levels , @xmath32@xmath16 . the abundances n / h and ca / h are , like mg / h , consistent with no radial variation , while c / h may be marginally increasing with radius ( 2@xmath16 ) .",
    "magnesium is produced mainly by type ii supernovae , while iron is released primarily by type ia supernovae , which are delayed with respect to star formation .",
    "therefore the smaller mg / fe ( and larger fe / h ) at large radius suggest the outer galaxies had extended star - formation histories prior to their quenching . in this scenario , it is qualitatively expected that a trend to younger ages would be accompanied by a trend towards lower mg / fe .",
    "quantitatively however , galactic chemical evolution models are required to determine what star - formation and enrichment histories could reproduce the observed behaviour .    finally , we note there is a significant radial colour correlation for the sample , with a slope @xmath20magdeg@xmath12 in @xmath21 ( bluer colour at larger radius ) .",
    "a small shift , with the same sense , was previously noted by terlevich , caldwell & bower ( 2001 ) and carter et al .",
    "the galaxies beyond 0.4deg have higher recession velocities by 340@xmath22220  than those in the core .",
    "preliminary profile fits to sdss images do not reveal significant radial trends in morphology .",
    "several authors have claimed to observe significant variation in absorption line strengths as a function of radius in clusters , with much of this work focused on the coma cluster .",
    "caldwell et al . (",
    "1993 ) were the first to note a large fraction of galaxies with strong balmer absorption in the south - west part of coma .",
    "their sample probed a smaller radial extent ( out to @xmath350arcmin ) than our work , and was restricted to brighter galaxies ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "their result has driven other work in the south - west region , influencing the field placement of subsequent studies including the current one .",
    "carter et al . (",
    "2002 ) observed coma galaxies over a wide luminosity range , @xmath24 , in the cluster core and an outer field in the south - west .",
    "the fainter part of their sample corresponds to typical luminosities in our mmt work , and the radial extent is comparable .",
    "they found a significant radial decrease in the mg@xmath25 index at fixed luminosity , interpreting the result as a metallicity gradient , with lower metallicities in the cluster outskirts .",
    "however , their data for iron - dominated indices do not share the radial trend , while  is found to increase with radius .",
    "taken together in fact , the results favour an interpretation in terms of age , rather than metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : gradboxes ] demonstrates good agreement between carter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the present work , at the level of the index gradients . our independent data , of much higher signal - to - noise , strongly confirm the earlier results for dwarfs in the south - west part of coma .    for giant galaxies , outside of coma , the situation appears quite different .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analysed line - strengths for @xmath33000 galaxies in @xmath390 clusters of the noao fundamental plane survey ( nfps ) .",
    "the nfps is dominated by @xmath0 galaxies , i.e. with luminosities 1540 times larger than our mmt sample .",
    "smith et al .",
    "found stronger balmer lines and weaker light - element features ( mgb5177 , cn2 , fe4668 ) at larger distance from the cluster centres .",
    "the iron - dominated indices show no radial dependence .",
    "this pattern can be reproduced by variations in both the age and the @xmath26-element abundance ratio  ( comparable to [ mg / fe ] ) , with no change in the overall metallicity  ( comparable to [ mg / h ] here ) .    .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] -2 mm    the nfps index gradients are much shallower than those found here or by carter et al .",
    "( figure  [ fig : gradboxes ] ) .",
    "the relative pattern of gradients is also different , with stronger gradients in the light - element indices than in the balmer lines .",
    "this is reflected in the gradients of derived parameters : the hectospec age gradient ( 0.35dexdeg@xmath12 ) is seven times larger than than the nfps trend ( 0.05dexdeg@xmath12 ) , while the mg / fe trend ( 0.12dexdeg@xmath12 ) is only a factor of 2.4 steeper than the nfps trend in  ( 0.04dexdeg@xmath12 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have confirmed earlier indications that the spectra of faint red - sequence galaxies in coma are correlated strongly with their distance from the cluster centre , at least toward the south - west .",
    "our analysis , using the latest stellar population models , provides a clear interpretation of the observed trends as being primarily due to age . since",
    "such strong radial trends are not seen in general for giant galaxies in clusters , a key question is whether the difference arises only from the different luminosity ranges , or whether the south - west region of coma is unrepresentative .",
    "if the latter , we may be observing the descendents of star - bursting galaxies in cluster - feeding filaments at @xmath27 ( e.g. fadda et al .",
    "future work must test whether dwarfs in other clusters , or in other parts of the coma cluster exhibit similarly strong cluster - centric correlations .",
