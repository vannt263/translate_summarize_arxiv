    "precise measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath30 probe the effect of radiative corrections to the @xmath12 propagator and the @xmath31 vertex . since the radiative corrections depend on the top and higgs masses , precise measurements can measure or constrain these quantities .",

    "a very small correction @xmath36(syst ) is applied to take into account residual contamination in the event sample and slight beam asymmetries .",
    "finally , the result is corrected for the electron beam polarization , the initial and final state radiation as well as for scaling the result to the @xmath12 pole energy : @xmath37 , giving @xmath38 .",
    "this preliminary measurement can be combined with previous measurements from the 1992 , 1993 , and 199495 running periods @xcite to yield @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this represents the most precise measurement of @xmath32 by a single experiment and its uncertainty is completely dominated by the statistical error .",
    "further information about @xmath32 can be obtained from @xmath12 decays into a pair of charged leptons ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) .",

    "this technique relies on the precise knowledge of the @xmath0 interaction point ( ip ) , 7 @xmath41 m ( 15 - 35 @xmath41 m ) perpendicular to ( along ) the beam direction , and the precise tracking achieved with the pixel - based vertex detectors : vxd2 for 199395 and vxd3 for 1996 and beyond . the upgraded detector ( vxd3 ) provides much improved polar angle coverage ( @xmath52 ) , lever arm and self - tracking capabilities , as well as a significantly reduced amount of material .",

    "the @xmath51  hemisphere vertex finding efficiency increases with the decay length @xmath58 to attain a constant level of 80% for @xmath59  mm . due to the typical @xmath60 cascade structure of the decays ,",

    "the first step ( after hadronic event selection ) in each analysis is to tag @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) events either by applying the mass tag utilized for the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) analysis , or by utilizing the fact that leptons from @xmath48 hadron decays have harder @xmath77 and @xmath62 ( with respect to the jet axis ) distributions than those from other processes . @xmath2 and/or @xmath3 are determined with a fit to the @xmath15-dependent differential cross section [ eq .",

    "a strong lifetime hierarchy is observed in the case of charm hadrons : @xmath96 .",
    "this hierarchy is predicted to scale with the inverse of the heavy quark mass squared and the @xmath48 hadron lifetimes are expected to differ by only 10 - 20%@xcite .",
    "the technique used by sld takes advantage of the excellent 3-d vertexing capabilities of the vxd to reconstruct the decays inclusively .",
    "the goal is to reconstruct and identify all the tracks originating from the @xmath48 decay chain .",
    "this then allows charged and neutral @xmath48 mesons to be separated by simply measuring the total charge of tracks associated with the @xmath48 decay .    the analysis @xcite uses the inclusive topological vertexing technique described earlier . in the hadronic @xmath12 event sample , we select 20,783 @xmath48 decay candidates by requiring @xmath64 gev and @xmath97 mm .",
    "the sample is divided into 7942 neutral and 12841 charged vertices corresponding to reconstructed decays with total charge @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , where @xmath100 is the charge sum of all tracks associated with the vertex .",
    "mc studies show that the ratio between @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays in the charged sample is 1.55 ( 1.72 ) for vxd2 ( vxd3 ) , and the ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath6 decays in the neutral sample is 1.96 ( 2.24 ) for vxd2 ( vxd3 ) ) implicitly includes its charge conjugate ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) . ] .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 lifetimes are extracted with a simultaneous binned maximum likelihood fit to the decay length distributions of the charged and neutral samples ( see fig .  [ fig_dkltop ] ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood fit yields lifetimes of @xmath102 ps , @xmath103 ps , with a lifetime ratio of @xmath104 .",
    "the main contributions to the systematic error come from uncertainties in the detector modeling , @xmath105 lifetime , @xmath51-baryon fraction , fit systematics , and mc statistics .",
    "these measurements are among the best currently available and confirm the expectation that the @xmath6 and @xmath7 lifetimes are nearly equal .      transitions between flavor states @xmath107 take place via second order weak interactions `` box diagrams . ''",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath108 for @xmath109 mixing depends on the ckm matrix element @xmath110 for which little is known experimentally .",
    "theoretical uncertainties are significantly reduced for the ratio between @xmath108 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus , combining measurements of the oscillation frequency of both @xmath109 and @xmath112 mixing translates into a measurement of the ratio @xmath113 .",
    "experimentally , a measurement of the time dependence of @xmath106 mixing requires three ingredients : ( i ) the @xmath48 decay proper time has to be reconstructed , ( ii ) the @xmath48 flavor at production ( initial state @xmath114 ) needs to be determined , as well as ( iii ) the @xmath48 flavor at decay ( final state @xmath115 ) . at sld , the time dependence of @xmath109 mixing has been measured using four different methods .",
    "all four use the same initial state tagging but differ by the method used to either reconstruct the @xmath48 decay or tag its final state .",
    "initial state tagging takes advantage of the large polarization - dependent forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath75 decays as described above . for left- ( right- )",
    "handed electrons and forward ( backward ) @xmath48 decay vertices , the initial quark is tagged as a @xmath51 quark ; otherwise , it is tagged as a @xmath116 quark .",
    "the initial state tag can be augmented by using a momentum - weighted track charge ( see @xmath2 measurement above ) in the hemisphere opposite that of the reconstructed @xmath48 vertex .",
    "these two tags are combined to yield an initial state tag with 100% efficiency and effective average right - tag probability of 82% ( for @xmath117 ) .",
    "two @xmath109 mixing analyses use topological vertexing ( see @xmath4 measurement ) to reconstruct @xmath48 decays .",
    "the @xmath89 flavor tag is performed by using either a kaon - charge tag ( as in the @xmath2 analysis ) or by exploiting the @xmath118 cascade charge structure .",
    "this latter tag is a novel technique developed by sld which relies on a `` vertex charge dipole '' defined as @xmath119 , where the first ( second ) term is a sum over all positive ( negative ) tracks in the vertex and the quantity @xmath120 corresponds to the longitudinal separation between the ip and the point of closest approach of track @xmath121 to the vertex line - of - flight .",
    "the weight @xmath122 is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in @xmath120 .",
    "two other analyses select semileptonic decays and thus use the lepton charge for the @xmath89 flavor tag .    the time dependence of @xmath109 mixing is measured from the fraction of decays tagged as mixed as a function of decay length or proper time .",
    "the four measurements are combined to produce the following sld average : @xmath123 ps@xmath124 , consistent with the world average value of @xmath125 ps@xmath124 .",
    "further details about the above measurements may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the above techniques ( except for the kaon tag ) can be extended to study @xmath112 mixing .",
    "recent studies at lep indicate that the oscillation frequency is very large : @xmath126 ps@xmath124 at the 95% c.l .",
    "therefore , excellent proper time , and thus decay length , resolution is required to improve that limit or observe oscillations . with vxd3",
    ", sld expects to achieve decay length resolutions of 80 - 100 @xmath41 m , i.e. a factor of @xmath127 better than those obtained at lep .",
    "given a sample of 500k hadronic @xmath12 decays with vxd3 , a limit of @xmath128 ps@xmath124 can be set at the 95% c.l . , see fig .",

    "many measurements relying on precise tracking will benefit greatly from the increased resolution and coverage of the upgraded vertex detector ( vxd3 ) installed before the 1996 run .",
