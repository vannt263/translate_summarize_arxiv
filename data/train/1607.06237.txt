    "the spontaneous pair condensation of electrons and holes ( excitons ) in semiconductors or semimetals was predicted to occur as an exotic ground state of matter more than half a century ago  @xcite .",
    "this phase is referred to as the excitonic ( condensation ) phase ( ep ) .",
    "actual materials in the ep still are , however , being searched for because the exciton is charge neutral and , unlike in superconductivity , to detect the pair condensation experimentally is not straightforward .",
    "one of the characteristic changes in the electronic structure at the ep transition is the band gap opening in semimetals and the band edge flattening in semiconductors , which angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments can detect .",
    "it was thereby suggested that some materials such as ta@xmath0nise@xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2-tise@xmath0  @xcite are actually in the ep . in particular , for ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 , characteristic behaviors of the elastic constant , specific heat , ultrasonic attenuation rate , and nmr relaxation rate  @xcite , as well as the arpes spectrum  , were discussed in this respect .",
    "a possible occurrence of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov - type excitonic state in ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 under high pressures was also discussed  @xcite .",
    "besides these physical quantities , it is known that a strong enhancement of the diamagnetic susceptibility below the excitonic transition temperature is observed in both ta@xmath0nise@xmath1",
    "@xcite and @xmath2-tise@xmath0  @xcite , which suggests that a fundamental relationship may exist between the excitonic condensation and diamagnetism . in this paper",
    ", we therefore calculate the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility in the excitonic condensation phase and consider its physical significance , which we hope will shed some light on the excitonic condensation in real materials .",
    "orbital diamagnetic susceptibility in a periodic potential was first formulated by peierls  @xcite , which was however applicable only to a single - band system .",
    "then , after much effort was made to extend the formula to multi - band systems , fukuyama  @xcite succeeded to generalize the formula , writing it in a mathematically compact form .",
    "this formula is applicable to tight - binding lattice models as well  @xcite , which therefore we will use in the present calculations .",
    "it was recently pointed out @xcite that the use of bloch wave functions , rather than the pure tight - binding lattice model , is important , the significance of which however we will leave for future study . because it is known that the effects of spin fluctuations hardly affect the diamagnetic susceptibility  @xcite , we expect that the formula will also be useful for ep .    in this paper",
    ", we will first introduce a two - orbital square - lattice model with an interorbital coulomb interaction , which is a minimum model for the excitonic condensation with active spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we will then obtain the ep of this model in the mean - field approximation and calculate the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility of this phase .",
    "we will thereby show that , in semiconductors , the excitonic condensation acquires a finite diamagnetic susceptibility due to spontaneous hybridization between the valence and the conduction bands , whereas in semimetals , the diamagnetic susceptibility in the normal phase ( np ) is suppressed by the excitonic condensation via the band gap opening .",
    "we will clarify the origin of these behaviors by a simple model calculation .",
    "we will also introduce a two - dimensional three - band model for describing the band structure near the fermi level of ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 and calculate the orbital diamagnetic and pauli paramagnetic susceptibilities of this system , assuming the spin - singlet excitonic condensation .",
    "we will show that the temperature dependence of the calculated total magnetic susceptibility is in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "let us first introduce a two - orbital model defined on the two - dimensional square lattice [ see fig .  [",

    "there is no hopping of electrons between the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 orbitals , but an interorbital repulsive interaction @xmath8 acts between two electrons in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "this is a minimum lattice model for the excitonic condensation .",

    "( [ eq : h_v ] ) into @xmath20 in the mean - field approximation . here",
    ", we neglect the intraorbital terms containing @xmath21 or @xmath22 because we do not consider the other ordered phases such as spin - density - wave and charge - density - wave phases in the present study . introducing the fourier transformations @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of the unit cells , we obtain the mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath26 in the spinor representation @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lattice constant .",
    "note that the hartree shift is excluded since we neglect the intraorbital terms .",

    ", we divide the brillouin zone into @xmath44 meshes in the mean - field self - consistent calculations and @xmath45 meshes in the susceptibility calculations .",
    "the summation over the matsubara frequencies is carried out with the usual analytical continuation technique .",
    "we assume a particle - hole symmetric situation @xmath46 and a number of electrons at half filling ( two electrons per site ) , so that we can set the chemical potential to be zero .",
    "we thus have a direct - gap semiconductor for @xmath47 and a semimetal for @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ fig : op_phase](b ) shows the calculated phase diagram of our model in the mean - field approximation .",
    "this phase diagram is enlarged near the semimetal - semiconductor phase boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : op_phase](c ) .",
    "we find that , in the semimetallic region @xmath48 , the ep persists down to an infinitesimal value of @xmath50 , whereas in the semiconducting region @xmath51 , it vanishes at a finite value of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , a comparatively large value of the interorbital coulomb interaction is required for the excitonic condensation in the semiconducting region .",
    "this result is in apparent contrast to the result of the electron gas model  @xcite , where the ep survives well above the semimetal - semiconductor transition point .",
    "this contrast may be understood because we assume a constant value of the coulomb interaction @xmath8 in the lattice model , whereas in the gas model , the interaction is screened in the semimetallic region but not in the semiconducting region .",

    "the calculated results for the temperature dependence of the orbital susceptibility are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamag_ep ] where we define a constant @xmath56 .",
    "let us first discuss the semiconducting case [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : diamag_ep](a ) ] where we assume the parameter values @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so that we obtain the transition temperature @xmath59 . above the transition temperature ,",
    "the orbital susceptibility is negative , indicating that the system is diamagnetic .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the ep transition occurs , at which the orbital susceptibility shows a kink .",
    "decreasing the temperature further , we find that the diamagnetic susceptibility is much enhanced in the ep , compared with the np . at zero temperature ,",
    "the orbital susceptibility remains negative ( diamagnetic ) , whereas it vanishes in the np .",
    "next , let us discuss the semimetallic case [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : diamag_ep](b ) ] where we assume @xmath60 and @xmath61 , so that we obtain @xmath62 . in the np ,",
    "the orbital susceptibility is largely negative ( strongly diamagnetic ) and almost temperature independent .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the orbital susceptibility shows a kink at the excitonic transition , and below the transition temperature , the diamagnetism is slightly weakened in the ep , compared with the np .    the orbital susceptibility calculated as a function of @xmath63 at low - temperature @xmath64",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamag_ep](c ) where we find that the essential difference occurs between the semiconducting and the semimetallic regions . in the semiconducting region @xmath47 ,",
    "the orbital susceptibility is almost zero in the np , and only for large values of @xmath50 where the system goes into the ep , does the diamagnetism appear . in the semimetallic region @xmath48 ,",
    "on the other hand , the orbital susceptibility is largely negative ( strongly diamagnetic ) already in the np , and the diamagnetism is weakened when the system goes into the ep with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "we note here that exactly the same results for the orbital susceptibility as above are obtained when we assume the spin - triplet excitonic condensation",
    ". also noted is that no change occurs in our results for the orbital susceptibility in the indirect gap situation @xmath65 .",
    "now , let us clarify the origin of the above - discussed behaviors of the orbital susceptibility . to this end",
    ", we introduce a hybridization @xmath66 between the @xmath4 and the @xmath3 orbitals artificially , without taking into account the excitonic condensation ; i.e. , we add a @xmath4-@xmath3 hybridization term , @xmath67 to the noninteracting hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : h_0 ] ) ]",
    "but we neglect the interaction term [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_v ] ) ] .",
    "the model remains electron - hole symmetric .",
    "we thus calculate the orbital susceptibility using the formula given in sec .",
    "[ sec : orb_sus ] .",
    "first , we consider the semiconducting case ( @xmath57 ) in the absence of the @xmath4-@xmath3 hybridization @xmath68 .",
    "the orbital susceptibility calculated as a function of the chemical potential @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamag_tcf](a ) . here , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 orbitals are completely independent so that it is clear that the orbital susceptibility vanishes when @xmath69 is in the semiconducting gap , i.e. , the electrons in the filled @xmath3 band can not move with an infinitesimal magnetic field .",
    "the peaks at @xmath70 are due to the van hove singularity of the present model .",
    "now , introducing a finite value of @xmath66 , we find that the system acquires the diamagnetic susceptibility even at @xmath71 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : diamag_tcf](b ) ] , where the band gap remains open .",
    "this result may be understood because the electrons in the filled valence band become mobile via the electron hopping @xmath66 ( or @xmath4-@xmath3 hybridization ) under an infinitesimal magnetic field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamag_tcf](c ) , we show the @xmath66 dependence of the orbital susceptibility in the semiconducting case .",
    "we find that the system acquires the diamagnetism with increasing @xmath66 as discussed above .",
    "however , the diamagnetism is weakened again for very large values of @xmath66 because the band gap in this situation becomes too large for the electrons to move easily .",
    "in the semimetallic case , of which the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamag_tcf](d ) , we find that the orbital susceptibility , which is largely negative even at @xmath72 as discussed above , is suppressed with increasing @xmath66 .",
    "this is because the band gap opens at @xmath73 and the gap size increases with increasing @xmath66 , so that the electrons become less mobile .",
    "the same discussion as above can be applied to the interpretation of the behavior of the orbital susceptibility calculated in the ep because the essential feature of the excitonic condensation is the spontaneous hybridization between the valence and the conduction bands .",

    "the primitive cell vectors are given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94    are estimated from experiment  @xcite .",

    "@xmath8 is the strength of this interaction .",
    "the intrasite repulsion terms in the ni and ta ions are neglected because of the same reasons given in sec .  [ sec : ex_cond ] .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling term is required to explain the lattice distortion that occurs at the ep transition in ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 . however , because the mean - field hamiltonian of the system is written in terms of a sum of the order parameter of the lattice distortion and the order parameter of the excitonic condensation as is evident in ref .",
    ", the electron - phonon coupling term contributes to the orbital susceptibility just as the @xmath8 term does .",
    "this means that the two contributions to the orbital susceptibility can not be distinguished within the framework of the theory so that hereafter we only refer to the @xmath8 term as a representative of both the @xmath8 term and the electron - phonon coupling term .",

    "we find that the orbital susceptibility shows diamagnetism and has a typical temperature dependence in the semiconducting phase as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] because this system is a direct - gap semiconductor .",
    "however , the contribution of the orbital susceptibility is rather small .",
    "this is because the system is quasione dimensional so that the component coming from the electric current perpendicular to the chains is much smaller than the component coming from the electric current parallel to the chains .",
    "the spin susceptibility , on the other hand , has large values at high temperatures and decreases rapidly below the excitonic transition temperature .",
    "we do not include the large diamagnetic contributions from the core electrons as well as the van vleck susceptibility , which are important in the total magnetic susceptibility  @xcite . however , these contributions are almost temperature independent and lead to a uniform negative shift to the magnetic susceptibility in total .",
    "our result indicates that the spin susceptibility and orbital susceptibility cooperatively enhance the diamagnetism in the ep of ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 , which is qualitatively consistent with experiment  @xcite .",
    "effects of electron correlations as well as a recent development in the theory of diamagnetism  @xcite , which are neglected in the present calculations , should be taken into account for more quantitative discussions , but we believe that the essential features of the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of ta@xmath0nise@xmath1 assuming the excitonic condensation are obtained in the present calculations .",

    "we showed that these results can be interpreted in terms of the hybridization between the valence and the conduction bands ; in semiconductors , the electrons in the valence band become mobile via the spontaneous hybridization with the conduction band so that the system acquires the diamagnetism when the excitonic condensation occurs , whereas in semimetals , the system is diamagnetic in the np and the spontaneous hybridization between the valence and the conduction bands leads to the band gap opening , which suppresses the diamagnetism .",
