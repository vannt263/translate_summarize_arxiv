    "the connection between the statistical physics of disordered systems and optimization problems in computer science dates back from twenty years at least  @xcite . in combinatorial optimization one",
    "is given a cost function ( the length of a tour in the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) , the number of violated constraints in constraint satisfaction problems ,   ) over a set of variables and looks for the minimal cost over an allowed range for those variables . finding the true minimum may be complicated , and requires bigger and bigger computational efforts as the number of variables to be minimized over increases  @xcite .",
    "statistical physics is at first sight very different .",
    "the scope is to deduce the macroscopic , that is , global properties of a physical system , for instance a gas , a liquid or a solid , from the knowledge of the energetic interactions of its elementary components ( molecules , atoms or ions ) .",
    "however , at very low temperature , these elementary components are essentially forced to occupy the spatial conformation minimizing the global energy of the system .",
    "hence low temperature statistical physics can be seen as the search for minimizing a cost function whose expression reflects the laws of nature or , more humbly , the degree of accuracy retained in its description .",
    "this problem is generally not difficult to solve for non disordered systems where the lowest energy conformation are crystals in which components are regularly spaced from each other . yet",
    "the presence of disorder , e.g. impurities , makes the problem very difficult and finding the conformation with minimal energy is a true optimization problem .    at the beginning of the eighties , following the works of g. parisi and others on systems called spin glasses  @xcite , important progresses were made in the statistical physics of disordered systems .",
    "those progresses made possible the quantitative study of the properties of systems given some distribution of the disorder ( for instance the location of impurities ) such as the average minimal energy and its fluctuations .",
    "the application to optimization problems was natural and led to beautiful studies on ( among others ) the average properties of the minimal tour length in the tsp , the minimal cost in bipartite matching , for some specific instance distributions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately statistical physicists and computer scientists did not establish close ties on a large scale at that time .",
    "the reason could have been of methodological nature  @xcite .",
    "while physicists were making statistical statements , true for a given distribution of inputs , computer scientists were rather interested in solving one ( or several ) particular instances of a problem .",
    "the focus was thus on efficient ways to do so , that is , requiring a computational effort growing not too quickly with the number of data defining the instance .",
    "knowing precisely the typical properties for a given , academic distribution of instances did not help much to solve practical cases .    at the beginning of the nineties practitionners in artificial intelligence",
    "realized that classes of random constraint satisfaction problems used as artificial benchmarks for search algorithms exhibited abrupt changes of behaviour when some control parameter were finely tuned  @xcite .",
    "the most celebrated example was random @xmath1-satisfiability , where one looks for a solution to a set of random logical constraints over a set of boolean variables .",
    "it appeared that , for large sets of variables , there was a critical value of the number of constraints per variable below which there almost surely existed solutions , and above which solutions were absent .",
    "an important feature was that the performances of known search algorithms drastically worsened in the vicinity of this critical ratio .",
    "in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest the random @xmath1-sat problem was therefore worth to be studied for ` practical ' reasons .    this critical phenomenon ,",
    "strongly reminiscent of phase transitions in condensed matter physics , led to a revival of the research at the interface between statistical physics and computer science , which is still very active .",
    "the purpose of the present review is to introduce the non physicist reader to some concepts required to understand the literature in the field and to present some major results .",
    "we shall in particular discuss the refined picture of the satisfiable phase put forward in statistical mechanics studies and the algorithmic approach ( survey propagation , an extension of belief propagation used in communication theory and statistical inference ) this picture suggested .",
    "while the presentation will mostly focus on the @xmath1-satisfiability problem ( with random constraints ) we will occasionally discuss another computational problem , namely , linear systems of boolean equations . a good reason to do so is that this problem exhibits some essential features encountered in random @xmath1-satisfiability , while being technically simpler to study . in addition",
    "it is closely related to error - correcting codes in communication theory .",
    "the chapter is divided into four main parts . in section  [ sec_basic ]",
    "we present the basic statistical physics concepts necessary to understand the onset of phase transitions , and to characterize the nature of the phases .",
    "those are illustrated on a simple example of decision problem , the so - called perceptron problem . in section  [ sec : phase_transitions ] we review the scenario of the various phase transitions taking place in random @xmath1-sat .",
    "section  [ sec_localsearch ] and  [ sec_decimation ] present the techniques used to study various type of algorithms in optimization ( local search , backtracking procedures , message passing algorithms ) .",
    "we end up with some conclusive remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec_conclu ] .",
    "for pedagogical reasons we first discuss a simple example exhibiting several important features we shall define more formally in the next subsection .",
    "consider @xmath2 points @xmath3 of the @xmath4-dimensional space @xmath5 , their coordinates being denoted @xmath6 .",
    "the continuous perceptron problem consists in deciding the existence of a vector @xmath7 which has a positive scalar product with all vectors linking the origin of @xmath5 to the @xmath8 s , @xmath9 or in other words determining whether the @xmath2 points belong to the same half - space . the term continuous in the name of the problem emphasizes the domain @xmath5 of the variable @xmath10",
    "this makes the problem polynomial from worst - case complexity point of view @xcite .",
    "suppose now that the points are chosen independently , identically , uniformly on the unit hypersphere , and call @xmath11 this quantity can be computed exactly  @xcite ( see also chapter 5.7 of  @xcite ) and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - proba ] as a function of the ratio @xmath12 for increasing sizes @xmath13 .",
    "obviously @xmath14 is a decreasing function of the number @xmath2 of points for a given size @xmath4 : increasing the number of constraints can only make more difficult the simultaneous satisfaction of all of them .",
    "more surprisingly , the figure suggests that , in the large size limit @xmath15 , the probability @xmath14 reaches a limiting value 0 or 1 depending on whether the ratio @xmath16 lies , respectively , above or below some ` critical ' value @xmath17 .",
    "this is confirmed by the analytical expression of @xmath14 obtained in  @xcite , @xmath18 from which one can easily show that , indeed , @xmath19    actually the analytical expression of @xmath14 allows to describe more accurately the drop in the probability as @xmath16 increases .",
    "to this aim we make a zoom on the transition region @xmath20 and find from ( [ percep1 ] ) that @xmath21 as it should the limits @xmath22 gives back the coarse description of eq .",

    "( [ percep1 ] ) , lines serve as guides to the eye.,width=264 ]      we now put this simple example in a broader perspective and introduce some generic concepts that it illustrates , along with the definitions of the problems studied in the following",
    ".    * constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) + a csp is a decision problem where an assignment ( or configuration ) of @xmath4 variables @xmath23 is required to simultaneously satisfy @xmath2 constraints . in the continuous perceptron",
    "the domain of @xmath10 is @xmath5 and the constraints impose the positivity of the scalar products ( [ question ] ) .",
    "the instance of the csp , also called formula in the following , is said satisfiable if there exists a solution ( an assignment of @xmath10 fulfilling all the constraints ) .",
    "the @xmath24 problem is a boolean csp ( @xmath25 ) where each constraint ( clause ) is the disjunction ( logical or ) of @xmath1 literals ( a variable or its negation ) .",
    "similarly in @xmath26 the literals are combined by an exclusive or operation , or equivalently an addition modulo 2 of @xmath27 boolean variables is required to take a given value .",
    "the worst - case complexities of these two problems are very different ( @xmath26 is in the p complexity class for any @xmath1 while @xmath24 is np - complete for any @xmath28 ) , yet for the issues of this review we shall see that they present a lot of similarities . in the following we use the statistical mechanics convention and represent boolean variables by ising spins , @xmath29 .",
    "a @xmath24 clause will be defined by @xmath1 indices @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath1 values @xmath31 , such that the clause is unsatisfied by the assignment @xmath10 if and only if @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "a @xmath26 clause is satisfied if the product of the spins is equal to a fixed value , @xmath33 .",
    "* random constraint satisfaction problem ( rcsp ) + the set of instances of most csp can be turned in a probabilistic space by defining a distribution over its constraints , as was done in the perceptron case by drawing the vertices @xmath34 uniformly on the hypersphere .",
    "the random @xmath24 formulas considered in the following are obtained by choosing for each clause @xmath35 independently a @xmath1-uplet of distinct indices @xmath36 uniformly over the @xmath37 possible ones , and negating or not the corresponding literals ( @xmath38 ) with equal probability one - half .",
    "the indices of random @xmath39 formulas are chosen similarly , with the constant @xmath40 uniformly .",
    "* thermodynamic limit and phase transitions + these two terms are the physics jargon for , respectively , the large size limit ( @xmath41 ) and for threshold phenomena as stated for instance in ( [ percep_trans ] ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the typical behavior of physical systems is controlled by a small number of parameters , for instance the temperature and pressure of a gas . at a phase transition these systems",
    "are drastically altered by a tiny change of a control parameter , think for instance at what happens to water when its temperature crosses @xmath42c .",
    "this critical value of the temperature separates two qualitatively distinct phases , liquid and gaseous . for random",
    "csps the role of control parameter is usually played by the ratio of constraints per variable , @xmath43 , kept constant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "( [ percep_trans ] ) describes a satisfiability transition for the continuous perceptron , the critical value @xmath44 separating a satisfiable phase at low @xmath16 where instances typically have solutions to a phase where they typically do not .",

    "this means that , for a large but finite size @xmath4 , the transition window for the values of @xmath53 where the probability drops from @xmath54 down to @xmath55 is , for arbitrary small @xmath55 , of width @xmath56 .",
    "results of this flavour are familiar in the study of random graphs  @xcite ; for instance the appearance of a giant component containing a finite fraction of the vertices of an erds - rnyi random graph happens on a window of width @xmath57 on the average connectivity .",
    "fss relations are important , not only from the theoretical point of view , but also for practical applications .",
    "indeed numerical experiments are always performed on finite - size instances while theoretical predictions on phase transitions are usually true in the @xmath15 limit .",
    "finite - size scaling relations help to bridge the gap between the two .",

    "[ sec_review_fss ] .",
    "let us emphasize that random @xmath24 , and other random csp , are expected to share some features of the continuous perceptron model , for instance the existence of a satisfiability threshold , but of course not its extreme analytical simplicity .",
    "in fact , despite an intensive research activity , the mere existence of a satisfiability threshold for random @xmath58 formulas remains a ( widely accepted ) conjecture .",
    "a significant achievement towards the resolution of the conjecture was the proof by friedgut of the existence of a non - uniform sharp threshold  @xcite .",
    "there exists also upper  @xcite and lower  @xcite bounds on the possible location of this putative threshold , which become almost tight for large values of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the chapter  @xcite of this volume for more details on these issues .",
    "this difficulty to obtain tight results with the currently available rigorous techniques is a motivation for the use of heuristic statistical mechanics methods , that provide intuitions on why the standard mathematical ones run into trouble and how to amend them . in the recent years important results first conjectured by physicists were indeed rigorously proven . before describing in some generality the statistical mechanics approach , it is instructive to study a simple variation of the perceptron model for which the basic probabilistic techniques become inefficient .",
    "the binary perceptron problem consists in looking for solutions of ( [ question ] ) on the hypercube i.e. the domain of the variable @xmath10 is @xmath59 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "this decision problem is np - complete .",
    "unfortunately cover s calculation  @xcite can not be extended to this case , though it is natural to expect a similar satisfiability threshold phenomenon at an a priori distinct value @xmath60 .",
    "let us first try to study this point with basic probabilistic tools , namely the first and second moment method  @xcite .",
    "the former is an application of the markov inequality ,",
    "@xmath61 \\le \\e[z ] \\ , \\label{eq_markov_inequality}\\ ] ] valid for positive integer valued random variables @xmath62",

    "this angle can be alternatively parametrized by the overlap between @xmath10 and @xmath76 , i.e. the normalized scalar product , @xmath77 the last expression , in which @xmath78 denotes the indicator function of the event @xmath79 , reveals the traduction between the concept of overlap and the more traditional hamming distance .",
    "the sum over vectors in ( [ mom2 ] ) can then be replaced by a sum over overlap values with appropriate combinatorial coefficients counting the number of pairs of vectors at a given overlap .",
    "the outcome is @xmath80 = 2^n\\sum _ { q=-1,-1+\\frac 2n , -1+\\frac 4n , \\ldots , 1 } \\binom{n}{n\\left(\\frac{1+q}2\\right ) } \\ \\left(\\frac 12 - \\frac 1 { 2\\pi } \\;\\mbox{arcos } \\ ; q \\right)^m \\ .\\ ] ] in the large @xmath4 limit we can estimate this sum with the laplace method , @xmath81 = \\max _ { -1 <",

    "indeed , maximization of @xmath83 ( [ defg ] ) over @xmath84 shows that @xmath85 \\gg ( \\e[z])^2 $ ] when @xmath4 diverges , whenever @xmath86 , and in consequence the left hand side of ( [ eq_inequality_2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "a possible scenario which explains this absence of concentration of the number of solutions is the following .",
    "as shown by the moment calculation the natural scaling of @xmath62 is exponentially large in @xmath4 ( as is the total configuration space @xmath87 ) .",
    "we shall thus denote @xmath88 the random variable of order one counting the log degeneracy of the solutions .",
    "suppose @xmath89 follows a large deviation principle  @xcite that we state in a very rough way as @xmath90 \\approx \\exp[n l(s)]$ ] , with @xmath91 a negative rate function , assumed for simplicity to be concave .",
    "then the moments of @xmath62 are given , at the leading exponential order , by @xmath92 = \\max_s [ l(s ) +",

    "the moments of larger and larger order @xmath94 are thus dominated by the contribution of rarer and rarer instances with larger and larger numbers of solutions . on the contrary",

    "numerical experiments support this value for the critical ratio of the satisfiable / unsatisfiable phase transition . *",
    "the calculation of the second moment is naturally related to the determination of the value of the overlap @xmath84 between pairs of solutions ( or equivalently their hamming distance , recall eq .",

    "note that the perceptron problem is not as far as it could seem from the main subject of this review .",
    "there exists indeed a natural mapping between the binary perceptron problem and @xmath24 .",
    "assume the vertices @xmath8 of the perceptron problem , instead of being drawn on the hypersphere , have coordinates that can take three values : @xmath117 .",
    "consider now a @xmath24 formula @xmath118 .",
    "to each clause @xmath35 of @xmath118 we associate the vertex @xmath34 with coordinates @xmath119 if variable @xmath120 appears in clause @xmath35 , @xmath50 otherwise .",
    "of course @xmath121 : exactly @xmath1 coordinates have non zero values for each vertex .",
    "then replace condition ( [ question ] ) with @xmath122 the scalar product is not required to be positive any longer , but to be larger than @xmath123 .",
    "it is an easy check that the perceptron problem admits a solution on the hypercube ( @xmath124 ) if and only if @xmath118 is satisfiable . while in the binary perceptron model",
    "all coordinates are non - vanishing , only a finite number of them take non zero values in @xmath24 .",
    "for this reason @xmath24 is called a diluted model in statistical physics .    also the direct application of the second moment method",
    "fails for the random @xmath24 problem ; yet a refined version of it was used in  @xcite , which leads to asymptotically ( at large @xmath1 ) tight bounds on the location of the satisfiability threshold .",
    "the binary perceptron example taught us that the number of solutions @xmath62 of a satisfiable random csp usually scales exponentially with the size of the problem , with large fluctuations that prevent the direct use of standard moment methods .",
    "this led us to the introduction of the quenched entropy , as defined in ( [ defsg0 ] ) .",
    "the computation techniques used to obtain ( [ solution_sg ] ) were in fact developed in an apparently different field , the statistical mechanics of disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "let us review some basic concepts of statistical mechanics ( for introductory books see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "a physical system can be modeled by a space of configuration @xmath125 , on which is defined an energy function @xmath126 . for instance",
    "usual magnets are described by ising spins @xmath127 , the energy being minimized when adjacent spins take the same value .",
    "the equilibrium properties of a physical system at temperature @xmath128 are given by the gibbs - boltzmann probability measure on @xmath87 , @xmath129 \\ , \\label{gibbs}\\ ] ] where the inverse temperature @xmath130 equals @xmath131 and @xmath62 is a normalization called partition function .",
    "the energy function @xmath79 has a natural scaling , linear in the number @xmath4 of variables ( such a quantity is said to be extensive ) . in consequence in the thermodynamic limit the gibbs - boltzmann measure concentrates on configurations with a given energy density ( @xmath132 ) , which depends on the conjugated parameter @xmath130 .",
    "the number of such configurations is usually exponentially large , @xmath133 $ ] , with @xmath89 called the entropy density .",
    "the partition function is thus dominated by the contribution of these configurations , hence @xmath134 .    in the above presentation we supposed the energy to be a simple , known function of the configurations .",
    "in fact some magnetic compounds , called spin - glasses , are intrinsically disordered on a microscopic scale .",
    "this means that there is no hope in describing exactly their microscopic details , but that one should rather assume their energy to be itself a random function with a known distribution .",
    "hopefully in the thermodynamic limit the fluctuations of the thermodynamic observables as the energy and entropy density vanish , hence the properties of a typical sample will be closely described by the average ( over the distribution of the energy function ) of the entropy and energy density .",
    "the random csps fit naturally in this line of research .",
    "the energy function @xmath126 of a csp is defined as the number of constraints violated by the assignment @xmath10 , in other words this is the cost function to be minimized in the associated optimization problem ( max@xmath58 for instance ) .",
    "moreover the distribution of random instances of csp is the counterpart of the distribution over the microscopic description of a disordered solid .",
    "the study of the optimal configurations of a csp , and in particular the characterization of a satisfiability phase transition , is achieved by taking the @xmath135 limit .",
    "indeed , when this parameter increases ( or equivalently the temperature goes to 0 ) , the law ( [ gibbs ] ) favors the lowest energy configurations . in particular",
    "if the formula is satisfiable @xmath136 becomes the uniform measures over the solutions .",
    "two important features of the formula can be deduced from the behavior of @xmath62 at large @xmath130 : the ground - state energy @xmath137 , which indicates how good are the optimal configurations , and the ground state entropy @xmath138 , which counts the degeneracy of these optimal configurations .",
    "the satisfiability of a formula is equivalent to its ground - state energy being equal to 0 . in the large @xmath4 limit",
    "these two thermodynamic quantities are supposed to concentrate around their mean values ( this is proven for @xmath79 in  @xcite ) , we thus introduce the associated typical densities , @xmath139 \\ , \\qquad   s_{\\rm g}(\\alpha ) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{n } \\e [ s_{\\rm g } ] \\ .\\ ] ] notice that formula ( [ defsg2 ] ) coincides with ( [ defsg0 ] ) in the satisfiable phase ( where the ground state energy vanishes ) .    some criteria are needed to relate these thermodynamic quantities to the ( presumed to exist ) satisfiability threshold @xmath69 . a first approach , used for instance in  @xcite , consists in locating it as the point where the ground - state energy density @xmath140 becomes positive .",
    "the assumption underlying this reasoning is the absence of an intermediate , typically @xmath141 regime , with a sub - extensive positive @xmath142 . in the discussion of the binary perceptron we used another criterion ,",
    "namely we recognized @xmath69 by the cancellation of the ground - state entropy density .",
    "this argument will be true if the typical number of solutions vanishes continuously at @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to realize that this is not the case for random @xmath24 : at any finite value of @xmath16 a finite fraction @xmath143 $ ] of the variables do not appear in any clause , which leads to a trivial lower bound @xmath144 $ ] on @xmath145 .",
    "this quantity is thus finite at the transition , a large number of solutions disappear suddenly at @xmath69 . even if it is wrong , the criterion @xmath146 for the determination of the satisfiability transition is instructive for two reasons .",
    "first , it becomes asymptotically correct at large @xmath1 ( free variables are very rare in this limit ) , this is why it works for the binary perceptron of section [ bper ] ( which is , as we have seen , close to @xmath24 with @xmath1 of order @xmath4 ) .",
    "second , it will reappear below in a refined version : we shall indeed decompose the entropy in two qualitatively distinct contributions , one of the two being indeed vanishing at the satisfiability transition .",
    "we have seen that the statistical physics approach to the perceptron problem naturally provided us with information about the geometry of the space of its solutions .",
    "maybe one of the most important contribution of physicists to the field of random csp was to suggest the presence of further phase transitions in the satisfiable regime @xmath147 , affecting qualitatively the geometry ( structure ) of the set of solutions  @xcite .",
    "this subset of the configuration space is indeed thought to break down into `` clusters '' in a part of the satisfiable phase , @xmath148 $ ] , @xmath149 being the threshold value for the clustering transition .",
    "clusters are meant as a partition of the set of solutions having certain properties listed below .",
    "each cluster contains an exponential number of solutions , @xmath150 $ ] , and the clusters are themselves exponentially numerous , @xmath151 $ ] .",
    "the total entropy density thus decomposes into the sum of @xmath152 , the internal entropy of the clusters and @xmath153 , encoding the degeneracy of these clusters , usually termed complexity in this context .",
    "furthermore , solutions inside a given cluster should be well - connected , while two solutions of distinct clusters are well - separated .",
    "a possible definition for these notions is the following .",
    "suppose @xmath10 and @xmath154 are two solutions of a given cluster",
    ". then one can construct a path @xmath155 where any two successive @xmath156 are separated by a sub - extensive hamming distance . on the contrary",
    "such a path does not exist if @xmath10 and @xmath154 belong to two distinct clusters .",

    "the choice of the flipped variable is made according to various heuristics ; the goal is to find a compromise between the greediness of the walk which seeks to minimize locally the energy of the current assignment , and the necessity to allow for moves increasing the energy in order to avoid the trapping in local minima of the energy function .",
    "a frequently encountered ingredient of the heuristics , which is of a greedy nature , is the focusing : the flipped variable necessarily belongs to at least one unsatisfied clause before the flip , which thus becomes satisfied after the move .",
    "moreover , instead of choosing randomly one of the @xmath1 variables of the unsatisfied clause , one can consider for each of them the effect of the flip , and avoid variables which , once flipped , will turn satisfied clauses into unsatisfied ones  @xcite . another way to implement the greediness  @xcite",
    "consists in bookkeeping the lowest energy found so far during the walk , and forbids flips which will raise the energy of the current assignment above the registered record plus a tolerance threshold .",
    "these demanding requirements have to be balanced with noisy , random steps , allowing to escape traps which are only locally minima of the objective function .    these more elaborated heuristics are very numerous , and depend on parameters that are finely tuned to achieve the best performances , hence an exhaustive comparison is out of the scope of this review .",
    "let us only mention that some of these heuristics are reported in  @xcite to efficiently find solutions of large ( up to @xmath310 ) random formulas of 3-@xmath58 at ratio @xmath16 very close to the satisfiability threshold , i.e. for @xmath311 .",
    "the algorithms studied in the remaining of the review are of a very different nature compared to the local search procedures described above . given an initial formula @xmath118 whose satisfiability has to be decided , they proceed by assigning sequentially the value of some of the variables .",
    "the formula can be simplified under such a partial assignment : clauses which are satisfied by at least one of their literal can be removed , while literals unsatisfying a clause are discarded from the clause .",
    "it is instructive to consider the following thought experiment : suppose one can consult an oracle who , given a formula , is able to compute the marginal probability of the variables , in the uniform probability measure over the optimal assignments of the formula . with the help of such an oracle it would be possible to sample uniformly the optimal assignments of @xmath118 , by computing these marginals , setting one unassigned variable according to its marginal , and then proceed in the same way with the simplified formula .",
    "a slightly less ambitious , yet still unrealistic , task is to find one optimal configuration ( not necessarily uniformly distributed ) of @xmath118 ; this can be performed if the oracle is able to reveal , for each formula he is questioned about , which of the unassigned variables take the same value in all optimal assignments , and what is this value .",
    "then it is enough to avoid setting incorrectly such a constrained variable to obtain at the end an optimal assignment .    of course such procedures",
    "are not meant as practical algorithms ; instead of these fictitious oracles one has to resort to simplified evidences gathered from the current formula to guide the choice of the variable to assign . in sec .",

    "however franco has shown that the deviations from its average locus in the plane vanish in the @xmath15 limit ( concentration phenomenon ) .",
    "large deviations from the typical behavior can be calculated e.g. to estimate the probability of success above @xmath338  @xcite .     for @xmath291 and @xmath339 . for all heuristics ,",

    "this result indicates that right at @xmath344 the probability of success decreases as a stretched exponential @xmath350 .",

    "if @xmath368 is selected by unit propagation , at some time both @xmath364 and @xmath365 will be marked , and this corresponds to a contradiction .",

    "in the first part of ( [ eq_wp ] ) , the message @xmath416 sent by a variable to a clause is computed by pondering the number of warnings sent by all other clauses ; it will in particular be negative if a majority of clauses requires @xmath120 to take the value unsatisfying @xmath35 .",
    "* survey propagation ( sp ) + the convergence of bp and wp iterations is not ensured on loopy graphs . in particular the clustering phenomenon described in sec .",
    "[ sec_clustering ] is likely to spoil the efficiency of these procedures .",
    "the survey propagation ( sp ) algorithm introduced in  @xcite has been designed to deal with these clustered space of configurations .",
    "the underlying idea is that the simple iterations ( of bp or wp type ) remain valid inside each cluster of optimal assignments ; for each of these clusters @xmath251 and each directed edge of the factor graph one has a message @xmath417 ( and @xmath253 ) .",
    "one introduces on each edge a survey of these messages , defined as their probability distribution with respect to the choice of the clusters .",

    "note also that the above sp equations have been shown to correspond to the bp ones in an extended configuration space where variables can take a `` joker '' value  @xcite , mimicking the variables which are not frozen to a single value in all the assignments of a given cluster .",

    "of course bp is only an approximate procedure , hence a practical implementation of this idea should privilege the variables with marginal probabilities closest to a deterministic law ( i.e. with the largest @xmath428 ) , motivated by the intuition that these are the least subject to the approximation errors of bp . similarly ,",
    "if the message passing procedure used at each assignment step is wp , one can fix the variable with the largest @xmath429 to the value corresponding to the sign of @xmath430 . in the case of sp , the solution of the message passing equations",

    "one tries to select an assignment preserving the maximal number of clusters .",
    "of course many variants of these heuristic rules can be devised ; for instance after each message passing computation one can fix a finite fraction of the variables ( instead of a single one ) , allows for some amount of backtracking  @xcite , or increase a soft bias instead of assigning completely a variable  @xcite .",
    "moreover the tolerance on the level of convergence of the message passing itself can also be adjusted .",
    "all these implementation choices will affect the performances of the solver , in particular the maximal value of @xmath16 up to which random @xmath58 instances are solved efficiently , and thus makes difficult a precise statement about the limits of these algorithms . in consequence",
    "we shall only report the impressive result of  @xcite , which presents an implementation  @xcite working for random 3-@xmath58 instances up to @xmath441 ( very close to the conjectured satisfiability threshold @xmath442 ) for problem sizes as large as @xmath443 .",
    "the theoretical understanding of these message passing inspired solvers is still poor compared to the algorithms studied in sec .",
    "[ secuc ] , which use much simpler heuristics in their assignment steps .",
    "one difficulty is the description of the residual formula after an extensive number of variables have been assigned ; because of the correlations between successive steps of the algorithm this residual formula is not uniformly distributed conditioned on a few dynamical parameters , as was the case with @xmath444 for the simpler heuristics of sec .",
    "[ secuc ] .",
    "one version of bp guided decimation could however be studied analytically in  @xcite , by means of an analysis of the thought experiment discussed at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec_decimation ] .",
    "the study of another simple message passing algorithm is presented in the next paragraph .",
    "feige proved in  @xcite a remarkable connection between the _ worst - case _ complexity of approximation problems and the structure of _ random _ 3-@xmath58 at large ( but independent of @xmath4 ) values of the ratio @xmath16 .",
    "he introduced the following hardness hypothesis for random 3-@xmath58 formulas :    hypothesis 1 : _ even if @xmath16 is arbitrarily large ( but independent of @xmath4 ) , there is no polynomial time algorithm that on most 3-sat formulas outputs unsat , and always outputs sat on a 3-sat formula that is satisfiable_.    and used it to derive hardness of approximation results for various computational problems . as we have seen these instances",
    "are typically unsatisfiable ; the problem of interest is thus to recognize efficiently the rare satisfiable instances of the distribution .",
    "a variant of this problem was studied in  @xcite , where wp was proven to be effective in finding solutions of dense planted random formulas ( the planted distribution is the uniform distribution conditioned on being satisfied by a given assignment ) .",
    "more precisely , @xcite proves that for @xmath16 large enough ( but independent of @xmath4 ) , the following holds with probability @xmath445 :    1 .",
    "wp converges after at most @xmath446 iterations .",
    "2 .   if a variable @xmath120 has @xmath447 , then the sign of @xmath430 is equal to the value of @xmath210 in the planted assignment .",
    "the number of such variables is bigger than @xmath448 ( i.e. almost all variables can be reconstructed from the values of @xmath430 ) .",
    "3 .   once these variables are fixed to their correct assignments , the remaining formula can be satisfied in time @xmath356 ( in fact , it is a tree formula ) .",
    "on the basis of non - rigorous statistical mechanics methods , these results were argued in  @xcite to remain true when the planted distribution is replaced by the uniform distribution conditioned on being satisfiable . in other words by iterating wp for a number of iterations bigger than @xmath446 one is able to detect the rare satisfiable instances at large @xmath16 .",
    "the argument is based on the similarity of structure between the two distributions at large @xmath16 , namely the existence of a single , small cluster of solutions where almost all variables are frozen to a given value .",
    "this correspondence between the two distributions of instances was proven rigorously in  @xcite , where it was also shown that a related polynomial algorithm succeeds with high probability in finding solutions of the satisfiable distribution of large enough density @xmath16 .",
    "these results indicate that a stronger form of hypothesis 1 , obtained by replacing _ always _ with _ with probability @xmath325 _ ( with respect to the uniform distribution over the formulas and possibly to some randomness built in the algorithm ) , is wrong for any @xmath449 .",
    "however , the validity of hypothesis 1 is still unknown for random 3-@xmath58 instances .",
    "nevertheless , this result is interesting because it is one of the rare cases in which the performances of a message - passing algorithm could be analyzed in full detail .",
    "this review was mainly dedicated to the random @xmath1-satisfiability and @xmath1-xor - satisfiability problems ; the approach and results we presented however extend to other random decision problems , in particular random graph @xmath84-coloring .",
    "this problem consists in deciding whether each vertex of a graph can be assigned one out of @xmath84 possible colors , without giving the same color to the two extremities of an edge . when input graphs are randomly drawn from erds - renyi ( er ) ensemble @xmath450 a phase diagram similar to the one of @xmath0-sat ( section [ sec : phase_transitions ] ) is obtained .",
    "there exists a colorable / uncolorable phase transition for some critical average degree @xmath451 , with for instance @xmath452  @xcite .",
    "the colorable phase also exhibits the clustering and condensation transitions  @xcite we explained on the example of the @xmath1-satisfiability .",
    "actually what seems to matter here is rather the structure of inputs and the symmetry properties of the decision problem rather than its specific details .",
    "all the above considered input models share a common , underlying er random graph structure . from this point of view",
    "it would be interesting to ` escape ' from the er ensemble and consider more structured graphs e.g. embedded in a low dimensional space .",
    "to what extent the similarity between phase diagrams correspond to similar behaviour in terms of hardness of resolution is an open question .",
    "consider the case of rare satisfiable instances for the random @xmath0-sat and @xmath0-xorsat well above their sat / unsat thresholds ( section  [ sec_decimation ] ) .",
    "both problems share very similar statistical features .",
    "however , while a simple message - passing algorithm allows one to easily find a ( the ) solution for the @xmath0-sat problem this algorithm is inefficient for random @xmath0-xorsat .",
    "actually the local or decimation - based algorithms of sections  [ sec_localsearch ] and [ sec_decimation ] are efficient to find solution to rare satisfable instances of random @xmath1-sat @xcite , but none of them works for random @xmath1-xorsat ( while the problem is in p ! ) .",
    "this example raises the important question of the relationship between the statistical properties of solutions ( or quasi - solutions ) encoded in the phase diagram and the ( average ) computational hardness .",
    "very little is known about this crucial point ; on intuitive grounds one could expect the clustering phenomenon to prevent an efficient solving of formulas by local search algorithms of the random walk type .",
    "this is indeed true for a particular class of stochastic processes  @xcite , those which respect the so - called detailed balance conditions .",
    "this connection between clustering and hardness of resolution for local search algorithms is much less obvious when the detailed balance conditions are not respected , which is the case for most of the efficient variants of prwsat ."
