    "the burgers equation was first introduced by j. m. burgers as a model for pressureless gas dynamics .",
    "it has since provided a tool for studying turbulence in fluids @xcite , for obtaining detailed asymptotics for stochastic schrdinger and heat equations @xcite and has played a part in arnold s work on caustics @xcite and maslov s works in semiclassical quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it has also been used for studying the formation of the early universe in the zeldovich approximation and also the adhesion model @xcite . a detailed explanation of these applications as well as a complete history of the burgers equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this article we will summarise a selection of results on the inviscid limit of the stochastic burgers equation and outline some applications of these results to turbulence and the adhesion model .",
    "we begin in section 2 with a summary of results on deterministic hamilton - jacobi theory for the heat and burgers equation .    in sections 3 to 5",
    "we present some geometric and analytic results first developed by davies , truman and zhao @xcite and later extended by truman and neate @xcite .",
    "these results relate the geometry of the caustic , hamilton - jacobi level surfaces and maxwell set to that of their algebraic pre - images under the inviscid classical mechanical flow map @xmath0 which will be defined in section 3 . in two dimensions",
    "these results show that a hamilton - jacobi level surface , or maxwell set can only have a cusp where their pre - images intersect the pre - caustic and so can only have cusps on the caustic .",
    "they also allow us to give conditions for the formation of swallowtails on both caustics and level surfaces which in turn have implications for the geometry of the maxwell set .",
    "we also introduce a reduced ( one dimensional ) action function which was developed by reynolds , truman and williams @xcite under the assumption that only singularities of @xmath1 type occur @xcite . using this , we can find explicit equations for the caustic , level surfaces and maxwell set and their pre - images .",
    "in section 6 we use this to write down an explicit stochastic process whose zeros give ` turbulent times ' at which cusps on the hamilton - jacobi level surfaces appear and disappear infinitely rapidly .",
    "finally , in sections 7 and 8 , we summarise results showing that the fluid has non - zero vorticity in some neighbourhood of the maxwell set @xcite .",
    "we show that this vorticity disappears under the assumptions required for the adhesion model for the evolution of the early universe and outline a new formula for the mass which adheres to the shock ( the maxwell set ) .",

    "the inviscid limit of the vorticity @xmath286 is defined to be , @xmath287 where @xmath118 denotes the leading behaviour of @xmath129 as @xmath76 .",
    "since the first term in @xmath288 is @xmath289 on @xmath184 , we obtain :    [ kelvin ] for @xmath274 , @xmath290    from corollary [ kelvin ] it follows that @xmath291 .",
    "hence , we expect that for small viscosity even though inititially there was zero vorticity , once a maxwell set appears , the flow is no longer irrotational .",
    "the above result shows that for small viscosity a vortex filament structure will appear in a neighbourhood of the cool part of the maxwell set .",
    "the limit of this vortex filament structure is a sheet of vortex lines on the cool part of the maxwell set .",
    "we now give the equation of these limiting vortex lines on the maxwell set in terms of orthogonal coordinates @xmath282 .",
    "the limiting vortex lines in a coordinate patch of @xmath184 have equations ,    @xmath292 @xmath293 where @xmath294 is a real constant and @xmath284 denotes the normal derivative @xmath285 on @xmath184 .",
    "this confirms that for our initial conditions , for small viscosity , and for compressible flow , vortex filaments will inevitably appear in a neighbourhood of the cool part of the maxwell set .",
    "given the rotational effects at work in the universe perhaps this suggests that we should consider the burgers equation with vorticity from the outset .",
    "kinematical considerations and galilean invariance suggest that the appropriate equation is a burgers equation with a vector potential .",
    "we hope to discuss this in a future paper @xcite .",
    "the adhesion model for the formation of the early universe is a refinement of the zeldovich approximation @xcite . in the original adhesion model",
    "there is no noise and a variational principle is assumed which forces the mass to move perpendicular to the cool part of the maxwell set ( often referred to as the shock ) with the same velocity as the maxwell set itself .",
    "this clearly results in mass adhering to the cool maxwell set leading to an accumulation of mass at certain points @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation gives the velocity of the maxwell set as , @xmath295 and a comparison with theorem [ v1 ] and corollary [ kelvin ] , reveals that this adhesion is sufficient to precisely destroy the vorticity near the maxwell set .",
    "when adhesion occurs , an interesting question to consider is how rapidly mass will accrete on the maxwell set as @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this would relate directly to the mass involved in the formation of galaxies on the shock . here",
    "we prove an inequality for the magnitude of the accumulated mass .",
    "for this analysis we need to first mollify the nelson diffusion process introduced in section 2 , equation ( [ itox ] ) , @xmath296 this mollification will remove the discontinuities in the drift caused by the maxwell set and caustic .    let @xmath297 , for some fixed @xmath298 , and let @xmath299 .",
    "assume that we can mollify the minimising hamilton - jacobi function @xmath300 such that , @xmath301 off some thin open set @xmath302 surrounding the cool maxwell set @xmath303 and the cool caustic @xmath304 where the lebesgue measure @xmath305 , and that @xmath306 is uniformly lipschitz in space and bounded for @xmath299 .",
    "we can then define a mollified potential , @xmath307 , corresponding to this new system such that , @xmath308 so that as @xmath76 , @xmath309 is a surface potential .",
    "this system then has a corresponding burgers equation , @xmath310 where this is the physically important velocity field in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath311 where @xmath312 is a sequence of real values such that @xmath313 as @xmath314 .",
    "let the diffusion associated with @xmath315 after mollification be denoted by @xmath316 and let , @xmath317 it is important to note that , formally at least , @xmath318 @xmath319,\\ ] ] where , @xmath320 here trev denotes time reversal so that , @xmath321 we need to assume that for sufficiently large @xmath123 , @xmath322    now assume that at any point @xmath22 on the cool maxwell set , @xmath323 divides space into @xmath324 parts .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 has @xmath324 minimising pre - images @xmath132 , ( @xmath325 ) and for each pre - image there is a corresponding @xmath326 given by , @xmath327    we assume that all @xmath328 are bounded and uniformly lipschitz in space away from the caustic .",
    "note that at a regular point of the maxwell set @xmath329 which is the case in which we are interested .",
    "in this case @xmath132 for @xmath330 correspond to matter arriving on different sides of the cool part of the maxwell set . arguing as in @xcite , the borel - cantelli and gronwall s lemmas give :    for @xmath299 and @xmath331 ( @xmath330 ) let , @xmath332 and @xmath333 with @xmath334 . then",
    ", if @xmath335 for @xmath297 , @xmath336 = 1.\\ ] ]    we can now give our results on the distribution of mass .",
    "we parameterise the cool maxwell set using the pre - maxwell set and flow map , @xmath337 define @xmath338 if the classical path from @xmath145 to @xmath323 avoids @xmath339 and @xmath303 for all @xmath340 .",
    "it now follows from our results in section 2 that :    let the mass adhering to the maxwell set in time interval @xmath341 be @xmath342 . then if , @xmath343 we obtain , @xmath344    the volume of @xmath323 is zero and @xmath342 is o(1 ) .",
    "therefore , the mass density on @xmath323 will be infinite in parts of @xmath323 in the inviscid limit .",
    "as we stated earlier , the process of adhesion forces the velocity away from @xmath184 to be zero , and consequently the adhering particles carry no vorticity .",
    "we now conjecture what happens when particles hit @xmath345 first . taking limits , @xmath346 is the contribution to the mass in the shock from paths with no kinks which would be caused by hitting the caustic before time @xmath23",
    ".    it would therefore be reasonable to calculate @xmath347 , the contribution of mass from paths with one kink caused by a single intersection with the caustic before adhesion occurs . in this case",
    "we see that the shock causes a compression or decompression of mass .",
    "this comes from a generalised ito formula for non @xmath81 functions .",
    "let @xmath348 where @xmath349 and @xmath350 the curvilinear open set ,",
    "@xmath351 @xmath352 if we then integrate over @xmath353 , and use the generalised ito formula for a discontinuous function due to elworthy , truman and zhao @xcite , we get , @xmath354 @xmath355\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath356 is the action evaluated at the appropriate minimising pre - image @xmath132 just above or below the caustic @xmath357 and @xmath358 is the normal derivative .",
    "the final factor in the integrand is the compression / decompression term coming from the adhesion process .",
    "in one dimension this result can be cast as a theorem . in higher dimensions",
    "it is only so far a conjecture .    clearly , the mass involved in the formation of galaxies in the early universe would be given by a sum of terms involving @xmath359 for @xmath360 .",
    "as discussed at the start of this section , the complete adhesion of all matter to the cool part of the maxwell set precisely destroys the rotation discussed in section 7 . however ,",
    "if the adhesion were only partial , this would not totally remove the rotation , and could explain the formation of spiral galaxies in the early universe .",
    "we will discuss such properties and detailed examples in a forthcoming work on the burgers equation with voriticity @xcite .",
