    "the possible existence of a spin - liquid phase on the honeycomb lattice has recently attracted considerable attention . meng _ et al._@xcite investigated the hubbard model for this system at half - filling , using large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations for clusters containing up to 648 sites .",

    "analogous ed cdmft calculations ( also for six bath levels ) were carried out by he and lu @xcite at a considerably lower effective temperature ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the excitation gap in this case was found to extend to @xmath13 . on the basis of these results",
    "the authors concluded that the spin - liquid phase of the honeycomb lattice at half - filling exists from @xmath14 up to the onset of the antiferromagnetic phase near @xmath15 .",

    "identified a spin - liquid phase in the range @xmath16 and semi - metallic behavior at smaller values of @xmath0 , seki and ohta obtained a similar insulating contribution to the self - energy at the dirac points as in ref .   and concluded that the mott gap persists down to arbitrarily small values of @xmath0 .",
    "most recently , hassan and snchal @xcite performed ed calculations for the honeycomb lattice within vca , cdmft and the cluster dynamical impurity approximation @xcite ( cdia ) .",
    "they argued that a bath consisting only of six levels is insufficient and leads to the erroneous conclusion that the system is gapped for all nonzero values of the onsite coulomb interaction @xmath0 .    in this context",
    "it is also important to recall the results of functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculations @xcite for the honeycomb lattice which reveal a stable semi - metallic phase below about @xmath17 .    in view of these contradictory results",
    "it is evident that the possible existence and extent of the semi - metallic phase of the honeycomb lattice are difficult to determine within present non - local many - body techniques . in particular , it is not clear which assumptions and approximations give rise to certain consequences : the size of the correlated cluster , the size and symmetry of the bath in ed , the accessible temperature range , the accuracy of spectral functions at very low energies , etc .",
    "naturally , these uncertainties also affect the identification of the elusive spin - liquid phase .",
    "the purpose of this work is to shed light on some of these issues by comparing new results derived within the dynamical cluster approximation @xcite ( dca ) with previous ones obtained within cdmft.@xcite as impurity solver we use finite - temperature ed as well as ctqmc .",
    "the nearly quantitative agreement between the ed and ctqmc self - energies , within dca as well as cdmft , demonstrates that the intrinsic limitations of these impurity solvers are not the cause of the discrepancies between the various results cited above .",
    "instead we show here that , in the special case of the honeycomb lattice , it is of crucial importance to preserve the translational invariance of the system .",
    "obviously , any deviation from bulk symmetry opens a gap at the dirac points .",
    "recall , for instance , the single - particle gaps obtained for graphene ribbons .",
    "thus , the semi - metallic and spin liquid phases can only be studied properly by using many - body methods that do not violate translation symmetry .",
    "this argument disqualifies cdmft which is well - known to yield a self - energy that is not translationally invariant.@xcite the self - energy components in this scheme account for correlations within the unit cell , but not between cells .",
    "we therefore believe that all cdmft calculations performed until now for the honeycomb lattice should exhibit , at low @xmath0 and low @xmath18 , an excitation gap which is an artifact caused by the lack of translation symmetry of the self - energy .",
    "although this gap is related to the presence of the local coulomb interaction , it is not a true mott gap but merely the consequence of the intrinsic limitation of the cluster approach . as a result , cdmft and other schemes that do not preserve translation invariance are not suitable for the identification of a spin - liquid phase on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the comparison of the cdmft self - energy with analogous results derived within dca , for ed as well as ctqmc , underlines this point . in dca ,",
    "the self - energy is by construction translationally invariant , so that the electronic structure at low @xmath0 is semi - metallic , in agreement with the predictions based on large - scale qmc and frg calculations.@xcite the spurious tail of the excitation gap at small @xmath0 and low @xmath18 that is seen in cdmft is absent in dca .    as will be shown below , in the case of the honeycomb lattice , the dca condition that ensures translation symmetry is too rigid for the description of correlations within the unit cell . as a result ,",
    "the semi - metallic phase is still stable near @xmath19 where cdmft and large - scale qmc calculations already find mott insulating behavior .",
    "thus , cdmft and dca may be viewed as complementary cluster schemes : dca is preferable at low @xmath0 since it maintains the long - range order that is crucial for the dirac cones , whereas cdmft yields a more realistic description of short - range correlations in the mott phase when the absence of translation symmetry plays a minor role .",
    "we also note here that the gap tail obtained in cdmft at small @xmath0 is not related to the finite size and symmetry properties of the bath used in ed . on the contrary , in the special case of the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "a rather small bath containing only six levels is sufficient for the description of short - range correlations within the six - site unit cell .",
    "the reason is that , because of the semi - metallic properties of the system , the projection of the bath green s function on a finite - cluster is not affected by the usual low - energy disparities that arise in the case of correlated metals .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section ii we discuss the application of dca and cdmft to the honeycomb lattice and point out the key difference between the self - energies obtained within these schemes .",
    "section iii presents the main ingredients of the ed impurity solver for both dca and cdmft .",
    "section iv provides the discussion of the results obtained within ed dca , and the comparison with analogous ctqmc dca results .",
    "the summary is presented in section v. throughout this work only paramagnetic phases are discussed .",

    "presumably , this insulating term is also present in the ed calculations reported in refs .   and .",
    "at finite @xmath18 , the gap is smoothened out so that it becomes difficult to determine its boundaries .",
    "in contrast , as discussed in section ii , dca preserves the bulk symmetry , so that @xmath154 and @xmath155 . thus , the dca self - energy at the dirac points is purely metallic , where the increasing magnitude of the coefficient @xmath178 implies increasing quasi - particle broadening and shift of spectral weight towards the fermi level as @xmath0 increases . from the initial slope of im@xmath89 at @xmath118",
    "we obtain an effective mass enhancement of about @xmath179 .",
    "the above discussion demonstrates that the presence or absence of the insulating contribution to @xmath170 is not caused by the impurity solver used in the cdmft or dca calculations .",
    "in fact , the good agreement between ed and ctqmc , for both cdmft and dca , suggests that in the case of the honeycomb lattice one bath level per impurity orbital is sufficient for an accurate fit of the bath green s function .",
    "the reason is that , because of the semi - metallic nature of the honeycomb lattice , the projection of the bath green s function of the infinite lattice onto a finite - cluster anderson green s function is not plagued by the low - energy - low - temperature discrepancies that usually occur in the case of correlated metals . in these systems",
    "at least two bath levels per impurity orbital are typically required and very low temperatures must be avoided.@xcite",
    "the role of coulomb correlations in hubbard model for the honeycomb lattice has been studied within finite - temperature exact diagonalization and continuous - time quantum monte carlo combined with the dynamical cluster approximation .",
    "the unique feature of dca is that it preserves the translation invariance so that the system at small values of @xmath0 is semi - metallic . in contrast , cdmft violates translation symmetry which implies the opening of an excitation gap at arbitrarily small @xmath0 , regardless of the impurity solver .",
    "this gap is therefore an artifact caused by the lack of long - range crystal symmetry and does not correspond to a true mott gap . at larger values of @xmath0 , however , many - body interactions are dominated by short - range correlations and translation symmetry seizes to be important .",
    "dca then becomes less accurate since it overemphasizes semi - metallic behavior .",
    "thus , for @xmath180 , cdmft is preferable and reveals a mott gap in qualitative agreement with large - scale qmc calculations .    in the case of the honeycomb lattice , dca and cdmft",
    "may therefore be viewed as complementary cluster approaches .",
    "as dca preserves translation symmetry , it is more appropriate in the semi - metallic phase at small @xmath0 where long - range order is a prerequisite for the description of the weakly correlated dirac cones .",
    "the condition @xmath154 which guaranties this symmetry , however , is unrealistic at larger @xmath0 , when short - range correlations within the six - site unit cell begin to dominate .",
    "thus , in the region of the mott phase , cdmft is more suitable . as a result of these inherent limitations of both cluster schemes ,",
    "the critical coulomb interaction defining the precise boundary between these phases is at present difficult to determine within either cdmft or dca .",
    "we emphasize that this difficulty is not related to the finite size or symmetry of the bath used in ed . on the contrary , within cdmft as well as dca , the ed self - energies agree well with the corresponding ctqmc results .",
    "it is interesting to inquire why the remarkable difference between cdmft and dca for the honeycomb lattice discussed in this paper does not also manifest itself in other systems , such as the hubbard models for square and triangular lattices . in these cases ,",
    "long - range order is mainly responsible for the logarithmic divergence of the van hove singularities of the density of states .",
    "thus , any lack of perfect translation symmetry would give rise to a rounding of this peak , an effect that would be difficult to distinguish from broadening induced by finite temperature and quasi - particle damping .",
    "in contrast , any rounding of dirac cones induces the opening of a gap . in this regard ,",
    "the dirac cones of the honeycomb lattice correspond to a rather peculiar special situation that does not arise in most cases which have been studied previously within cdmft and dca at finite temperatures .",
