    "<S> experimentally measurable _ quantities remains a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for that is that characterization of entanglement in a many - particle system generically requires the measurement of a prohibitively large number of observables .    </S>",
    "<S> a different class of quantities is the one of overlaps , or fidelities . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is perhaps more intuitive and can be traced back to anderson s orthogonality catastrophe @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . let @xmath12 be a hamiltonian which depends on a physical parameter @xmath13 that can be varied . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath14 is its ground state , the fidelity is @xmath15 close to a qcp the fidelity susceptibility @xmath16 diverges , so this quantity can be used to detect quantum phase transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior of the fidelity has been studied in various systems both analytically and numerically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> overlaps are also interesting when considering time - evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> starting from an initial state @xmath17 , one can ask what the overlap of the wavefunction with the initial state after time @xmath18 is . </S>",
    "<S> the loschmidt echo @xmath19 @xcite has been studied in connection with nmr experiments @xcite , and also in the context of quantum criticality @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce an overlap which shares some common properties with the ee ( in particular we keep the idea of cutting the system into two parts ) , despite being conceptually simpler . </S>",
    "<S> we call it _ logarithmic bipartite fidelity _ ( lbf ) , and claim that it provides valuable insights into quantum critical phenomena </S>",
    "<S> . we shall see in particular that the lbf obeys an area law in @xmath3 , can be useful to locate qcps , and has a universal scaling form at one - dimensional qcps that involves the central charge @xmath6 , much in the spirit of the ee .    _ </S>",

    "<S> we introduce the _ bipartite fidelity _ @xmath31 , the overlap between the ground - state of the total hamiltonian @xmath30 , and the ground state of a hamiltonian @xmath28 where all interactions between @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been switched off . a more physical way of looking at this quantity is to interpret it as a probability of measuring a given energy after a local quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> let us imagine that the system is initially disconnected ( i.e. it is in the ground state of @xmath28 ) , and that at time @xmath32 the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is instantaneously switched on . </S>",

    "<S> the bulk and surface energies are canceled out by the linear combination , and we get @xmath56 where @xmath11 is the `` area '' of the boundary between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the initial @xmath57-dimensional system . this is the area law for the lbf . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this to be true for generic systems , as is the case usually for the ee , however like for the ee @xcite , exceptions are possible .    _ </S>",
    "<S> 1d conformal qcps_. in general , @xmath58 should be finite away from a qcp , because the correlation length @xmath59 is small and the two ground - states are very close to each other , except on a thin region of typical size @xmath59 . at a qcp </S>",
    "<S> however , this is no longer true and @xmath58 can become large . as the calculation of the overlap boils down to a free energy , </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior should be controlled by the conformal symmetry only . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case , and this result constitutes the central point of our work . </S>",
    "<S> the geometries considered are shown in table .  </S>",

    "<S> here we stress the fact that the time - dependent lbf grows logarithmically as well . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the bipartite fidelity in that case is nothing but a loschmidt echo @xmath129 so the lbf is @xmath130 its universal behavior can be derived in cft as follows . in imaginary time </S>",

    "<S> for the geometry of a cylinder of height @xmath142 cut into two parts ( see ref .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath144 stands for dirichlet and encode the conformal invariant boundary condition at both end of the cylinders in the continuum limit . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite : @xmath146 it would certainly be interesting to study this idea in more complicated models .    as is the case for the ee @xcite , we also speculate that subleading terms in the lbf might be used to identify topological order . for certain trial wave - functions , such as rokhsar - kivelson triangular lattice quantum dimer and levin - wen string net wave - functions , the lbf is nothing but the @xmath147 rnyi entropy . </S>",
    "<S> then the arguments in @xcite would yield the same subleading constant in the lbf and in the ee . </S>",
    "<S> another way of looking at this would be to compare the eigenstate of the reduced density matrix associated with its largest eigenvalue to the actual ground state of the physical hamiltonian @xmath25 . for a generic hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> there is no reason why there should be any relation between those two states . </S>",
    "<S> however , for special hamiltonians associated with trial wave functions , we speculate that they might be closely related to each other . we leave this important open question for future studies .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion_. we have introduced the lbf of an extended quantum system @xmath0 , and studied some of its properties . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown in particular that it generically obeys an area law , and exhibits universal behavior at 1d and 2d qcps , like the ee . </S>",
    "<S> we note that its simple definition makes it easier to grasp intuitively than the ee , and convenient to study using standard analytical and numerical methods </S>",
    "<S> . this could be particularly useful in dimension @xmath3 , where quantum monte carlo algorithms allow to compute efficiently ground state overlaps , as opposed to the von neumann entropy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we believe that the lbf can be a useful and general tool in the study of quantum many - body systems .    _ </S>",
