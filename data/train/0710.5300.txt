    "certain aspects of general relativity are well tested . for example , the schwarzschild metric has been quantitatively verified in the weak - field limit on small scales , e.g. , the solar system @xcite and binary radio pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , it is probably fair to say that the friedmann equations , while providing a self - consistent and highly successful framework for cosmology , have not been subjected to extensive , independent testing . in this paper",
    "we show that one particular aspect of the friedmann equations , the self - gravity of pressure , can be tested quantitatively .",
    "the development of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) codes @xcite , coupled with measurements of the relevant nuclear reaction rates @xcite , have allowed observations of light element abundances to become powerful tools with which to investigate the early evolution of the universe .",
    "computational predictions over a wide range of parameter space , when compared with primordial abundances inferred from observations , have yielded constraints on the current - epoch baryon density @xcite , neutrino physics @xcite , the fine structure constant @xcite , the gravitational constant @xcite , primordial magnetic fields @xcite , the universal lepton asymmetry @xcite and other parameters of astrophysical interest .",
    "increasingly accurate measurements of element abundances , as well as improved understanding of the processes ( i.e. , stellar and galactic nucleosynthesis ) which have altered the original abundances , allow these restrictions to be continually refined .",
    "deuterium abundances @xcite , helium abundances @xcite , and lithium abundances @xcite have all been well measured , although the inferred primordial abundances are subject to large and often difficult to quantify systematic uncertainties .",
    "more recently , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have yielded an independent estimate of @xmath0 , the baryon to photon ratio at a much later epoch in the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "for an isotropically expanding universe in which the matter / energy is distributed homogeneously , the expansion of the universe is described by a time - dependent scale factor , @xmath1 . in the standard friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker ( frw ) cosmology , the time variation of the scale factor is given by the friedmann equations in terms of the average density and pressure .",
    "for example , the `` acceleration '' of the scale factor , @xmath2 , is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density and @xmath5 is the pressure .",
    "this is the exact @xmath6 component of the einstein field equation for a homogenous and isotropic universe .",
    "note that the @xmath7 term , implying the self - gravity of pressure , is a purely general relativistic ( gr ) effect , with no analog in newtonian gravity .",
    "the  velocity \" of the scale factor , @xmath8 , is given by the friedmann - lemaitre equation : @xmath9 whose origin is the @xmath10 component of the einstein field equations ( the second term on the right hand side of the equation is due to the curvature ; @xmath11 is the curvature constant which appears in the robertson - walker metric ) . for any fluid ,",
    "given its equation of state , i.e. , @xmath12 , eq .",

    "we will , by necessity , no longer be assuming the validity of gr .",
    "however , we will retain the energy conservation of expanding fluids via the first law of thermodynamics ( the perfect fluid approximation or entropy conservation ) .",
    "we start with a `` newtonian cosmology '' @xcite which , of course , can not be completely justified outside the context of gr , but which nonetheless provides considerable insight into our testing of the @xmath13 term @xcite . for the usual newtonian gravity , this amounts to @xmath14 for the special , zero - pressure case where @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be integrated to yield the familiar expression for @xmath16 : @xmath17 for the newtonian analysis , the constant in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is simply a constant of integration , in contrast to the curvature term which appears in the friedmann equation , eq .",
    "this form of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is , however , only valid for the special case of a pressureless fluid .",
    "what is missing from eq .",
    "( 3 ) for the general case of a fluid with non - zero pressure is a term accounting for the self - gravity of pressure ( see eq .  1 ) , which has no expression in a purely newtonian formulation .",
    "suppose we now add such a term to eq .",

    "having set aside gr , which would otherwise connect the integration constant in equations  ( 8) & ( 9 ) to the geometry , there is no fundamental connection to the geometry of the underlying space - time in our proposed modification of the friedmann equations .    for the case",

    "we reemphasize that @xmath36 can no longer be interpreted in terms of the curvature  it is just a constant of integration . if @xmath37 eq .",
    "( 10 ) has consequences for the cmb and current matter / vacuum dominated epochs , in addition to the bbn epoch , some of which could independently constrain @xmath18 , but these are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we now focus on the epoch when the energy density contributed by relativistic particles ( including relativistic neutrinos ) ,  radiation \" , dominated the energy density of the universe and radiation pressure is important .",
    "our goal is to constrain @xmath18 by comparing bbn predictions with observations of light element abundances .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe during this epoch is described by @xmath38 where the @xmath39 term which appears in eq .",
    "( 10 ) has been dropped because it is negligible compared to the @xmath40 term during the radiation - dominated , bbn epoch . as revealed by eq .  ( 11 ) , the effect of a value of @xmath18 which differs from unity is to change the early - universe expansion rate ( hubble parameter ) from its standard value . in this sense , @xmath41 is equivalent to an early - universe value of the gravitational constant @xcite which differs from its present value or , a total relativistic energy density which differs from its standard - model value ( as often parameterized by the effective number of neutrinos : @xmath42n@xmath43 )  @xcite .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations were performed with a bbn code which has been updated with the latest reaction rates and whose output has been compared to that of other , published codes . since the parameter we seek to constrain , i.e. , @xmath44)/2 , is multiplicative with @xmath45 , we have simply varied @xmath45 as a surrogate for @xmath18 .",
    "thus , in our case the bbn - predicted abundances are functions of the baryon density parameter @xmath46 and @xmath45 . in this work @xmath47200000 bbn calculations",
    "were performed , varying @xmath18 from 0 to 2 in steps of 0.002 ( or equivalently @xmath48 from 1/2 to 3/2 in linear steps of 0.001 ) and varying @xmath49 from @xmath50 to @xmath51 in steps of 1/200 dex .",
    "the results of these calculations are the isoabundance contours for deuterium , helium-4 , and lithium-7 shown in the @xmath52 , @xmath53 plane in figure .  1 .",
    "as estimated in @xcite , for fixed values of @xmath54 and @xmath45 , the uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates contribute a @xmath55% uncertainty ( @xmath56 ) to the bbn - predicted abundance of deuterium , and as estimated in @xcite @xmath57  0.2% ( @xmath58 ) for the @xmath59he mass fraction .",
    "deuterium provides an excellent constraint on the baryon density because its post - bbn evolution is simple ( d is only destroyed when gas is cycled through stars ) and the observed amounts require that it must have formed in the big bang rather than in stellar or galactic processes @xcite .",
    "also , its bbn - predicted abundance is extremely sensitive to the baryon to photon ratio , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "deuterium measurements along the lines of sight to high redshift quasars have led to the current determination of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 confidence ; * ? ? ?",
    "contours of constant deuterium abundance ( by number ) are shown as green curves in fig.1 .",
    "although bbn production of @xmath63he is relatively insensitive to @xmath0 , its abundance provides an extremely useful constraint on the early - universe expansion rate ( the hubble parameter ) and , therefore , on @xmath18 . as stars and",
    "galaxies evolve , stellar nucleosynthesis results in some post - bbn production of @xmath63he . as a consequence ,",
    "the primordial abundance ( mass fraction ) of @xmath63he , y@xmath64 , is best determined from present - day observations of low - metallicity , extragalactic hii regions which are less contaminated by post - bbn produced @xmath63he .",
    "since the total number of such hii regions exceeds 80 @xcite , it is not surprising that the formal , statistical uncertainty in y@xmath64 is small .",
    "however , it has been well known for decades @xcite that systematic corrections , such as underlying stellar absorption , ionization corrections , collisional excitations , etc .",
    ", have the potential to change the central value of y@xmath64 as well as to increase significantly the error budget .",
    "the largest data set of consistently observed and analyzed hii regions is from @xcite who find y@xmath65 .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "have recently revised this to @xmath66 ( @xmath62 confidence ; * ? ? ?",
    "these analyses largely ignore most sources of systematic uncertainty , resulting in an error , largely statistical , which is too small to reflect the true uncertainty in y@xmath64 .",
    "accounting for some , but not all sources of systematics , and employing a model - dependent linear extrapolation of y to zero oxygen abundance , y@xmath64 has very recently been inferred by @xcite to be @xmath67 .",
    "contours of constant helium-4 mass fraction are shown as blue curves in fig.1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for sbbn ( @xmath20 ) , as well as for bbn with @xmath18 allowed to be free , the predicted primordial abundances of deuterium and lithium are strongly coupled  @xcite ; see , fig .  1 .",
    "for our choice of the primordial d abundance , and for either choice of the primordial @xmath63he abundance , the predicted primordial lithium abundance lies in the range 12+log(li / h ) = 2.6  2.7 .",
    "this is in contrast to the best determinations of the lithium abundance in the oldest , most metal - poor stars in the halo of the galaxy , where 12+log(li / h ) @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted explanation of this factor of 3  4 discrepancy is that the lithium observed at present in these oldest stars in the galaxy has been diluted / depleted from the initial lithium abundance in the gas out of which these , nearly primordial , stars formed @xcite but , for a contrary point of view , see @xcite .",
    "figure 1 displays the results of our analysis .",
    "a section of the @xmath52 , @xmath53 parameter space is shown , with _ number _ density ( relative to hydrogen ) contours for deuterium shown in green , for lithium shown in purple , and for the _ mass _ fraction of he-4 shown in blue .",
    "notice that the pairs of @xmath69d / h , y@xmath70 or of @xmath69li / h , y@xmath70 abundances form nearly orthogonal grids in the @xmath52 , @xmath53 plane , so that the primordial abundances of either pair of these nuclides are sufficient to bound the cosmologically interesting parameters @xmath18 and the baryon density parameter @xmath54 . given the uncertainty in inferring the primordial lithium abundances from the observational data , only the deuterium and helium-4 pair is used in our analysis .",
    "assuming statistically - independent gaussian errors ( almost certainly , neither the errors in d nor those in @xmath63he are truly gaussian ) , one can calculate the probability , via a maximum likelihood analysis , that the abundance determinations agree with the corresponding results of the bbn calculations at a given point in the @xmath52 , @xmath53 parameter space .",
    "the thick black contour is for the 90% range in @xmath54 and @xmath18 corresponding to the @xcite deuterium abundance and the @xcite helium abundance .",
    "the narrowness of this contour in the vertical ( @xmath18 ) direction is a direct consequence of the size of the @xcite estimate of the error in y@xmath64 .",
    "given the sensitivity of @xmath18 to y@xmath64 , it is interesting to explore the consequence of adopting a different central value and uncertainty in y@xmath64 , while keeping the same primordial d abundance . to this end , we choose y@xmath71 from @xcite .",
    "the thin , gray contour in fig.1 corresponds to the 90% range for this alternate choice of y@xmath64 .",
    "both choices are consistent with the standard , friedman - lemaitre result @xmath20 .",
    "as illustrated in figure 1 , the combined constraints are , within the uncertainties , consistent with the general relativity prediction of @xmath20 and the independent ( of bbn ) wmap constraint on @xmath54 of @xmath72 @xcite which corresponds to @xmath20 . for the @xcite choice of y@xmath73 , @xmath74 , while for the steigman @xcite helium abundance , @xmath75 .",
    "note that the data strongly exclude @xmath21 .",
    "the current light element observations and bbn computations have provided a test of the general relativistic self - gravity of pressure .",
    "since the modification of gr we are testing corresponds , for the radiation - dominated evolution appropriate for bbn , to an overall multiplicative factor of the product of newton s gravitational constant and the radiation density , @xmath76 , our result is equivalent to the bbn constraint on the variation of newton s constant or , alternatively , to a modification of the radiation energy density as parameterized by the effective number of neutrinos ( see  1 for references ) .",
    "@xmath77 assuming that these other parameters take on their standard - model values ( @xmath78 ) , the self - gravity of the radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) pressure during the bbn epoch has been constrained quantitatively .",
