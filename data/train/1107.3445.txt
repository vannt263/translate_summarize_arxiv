    "according to the latest analysis@xcite of extended data records of the pioneer @xmath6 spacecraft , the small frequency drift@xcite ( blue - shift ) observed analyzing the navigational data of both the spacecraft , known as pioneer anomaly ( pa ) , may present a further time - dependent component in addition to the well known constant one .",
    "both linear and exponential models were proposed@xcite for the pa ; according to the authors of ref .  , the exponential one is directly connected to non - gravitational effects@xcite since it takes into account the possible role of the on - board power generators suffering a radioactive decay .",
    "in this letter we work out the orbital effects of such a new term in the hypothesis that the time - dependent pa component is due to some sort of long - range modification of the known laws of gravitation resulting in an additional anomalous acceleration with respect to the nearly sunward constant one , having magnitude@xcite |a_pio|=(8.741.33)10 ^ -10  m  s^-2,in terms of which the constant part of the pa has often been interpreted",

    "recent studies@xcite , partly preceding the one in ref .",

    "since the anomalous acceleration is@xcite a_pio-210 ^ -11  m  s^-2  yr^-1,the time - dependent linear component of the postulated pa - type acceleration@xcite a= ( t - t_0)a_piocan be treated as a small perturbation of the dominant newtonian monopole @xmath7 over timescales of the order of an orbital period @xmath8 for all the planets of the solar system .",
