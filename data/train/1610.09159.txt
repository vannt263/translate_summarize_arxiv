    "plasmas one may expect the development of thermal pressure anisotropies .",
    "lack of collisional mechanisms of exchange of particle energy between degrees of freedom parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction may obviously lead to an asymmetric distribution function for particle velocities . in the lowest - order approximation ,",

    "<S> we present a numerical solver for plasma dynamics simulations in hall magnetohydrodynamic ( hmhd ) approximation in one , two and three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both isotropic and anisotropic thermal pressure cases , where a general gyrotropic approximation is used . </S>",
    "<S> both explicit energy conservation equation and general polytropic state equations are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical scheme incorporates second - order runge - kutta advancing in time and kurganov - tadmor scheme with van leer flux limiter for the approximation of fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> a flux - interpolated constrained - transport approach is used to preserve solenoidal magnetic field in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the implemented code is validated using several test problems previously described in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we propose a new validation method for hmhd codes based on solitary waves that provides a possibility of quantitative rigorous testing in nonlinear ( large amplitude ) regime as an extension to standard tests using small - amplitude whistler waves . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative tests of accuracy and performance of the implemented code show the fidelity of the proposed approach .    </S>",
