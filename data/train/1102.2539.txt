    "one of the major unsolved problems in astrophysics today is the nature of the connection between the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "current models invoke a close interplay (  feedback \" ) between smbhs and their host galaxies in order to arrest the growth of the most massive galaxies , which are otherwise over - predicted by models of structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of high - redshift galaxies paint a somewhat confusing picture of the relationship between star formation and black hole growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best - studied population of high - redshift star - forming galaxies are the lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) and closely related types of uv - selected galaxies .",
    "they represent a major phase in the early stages of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "they are a primary tracer of high redshift star formation , as they are easily found at @xmath9 in deep pencil beam optical surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lbgs are believed to be the precursors of present day galaxies undergoing a phase of intense star formation and merging , and a large fraction of lbgs may merge to form early - type galaxies that are situated in present - day groups and clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the lbgs do not harbor an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) luminous enough to be individually detected in the deepest x - ray surveys .",
    "however , a subset ( @xmath23% ) of lbgs with actively accreting smbhs has been identified @xcite .",
    "these agns typically have x - ray luminosities of @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 in the 2 - 10 kev energy range , and often show signs of significant obscuration .",
    "detailed studies of what might trigger both the agns and the starbursts in these forming galaxies are difficult since their distances render them small and faint .",
    "the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ) mission is conducting surveys in the far- and near - uv ( @xmath11 1600 and 2300   respectively ) and has been used to identify a rare population of low - redshift ( @xmath120.1 - 0.3 ) galaxies that are remarkably similar to high - redshift lbgs in most physical properties @xcite .",
    "this population was first identified by @xcite and @xcite , based on cross - matching the _ galex _ and sloan digital sky survey data .",
    "these objects were defined by two criteria designed to match the typical lbgs : 1 ) a minimum luminosity in the far - uv ( fuv ) band @xmath13 ; 2 ) an fuv effective surface brightness @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mean fuv surface brightness interior to the sdss @xmath16 half - light radius .",
    "these local `` lyman break analogs '' ( lba ) are similar to distant lbgs in size , surface brightness , metallicity , dust , star formation rate ( sfr ) , stellar mass , and gas velocity dispersion .",
    "there are other local star forming galaxies , e.g. , ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , which have some similarities with lbgs .",
    "however , ulirgs are much more heavily obscured by dust , and bcds are much smaller in mass and luminosity ( star - formation rate ) compared with lbgs .",
    "these differences make them poorer local analogs to lbgs .",
    "however , it is intriguing that an actively accreting smbh has recently been reported in a nearby dwarf starburst galaxy @xcite .",
    "interestingly , about 20% of the lbas have optical emission - line spectra that are intermediate between those of pure starbursts and those of type 2 ( obscured ) agn . as discussed by @xcite , the optical spectra alone",
    "do not unambiguously establish the presence of a type 2 agn",
    ". they may instead be extreme starburst systems in which the physical conditions in the ionized gas are different from typical local starbursts .",
    "@xcite also presented imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ that showed that most of these possible starburst - agn composites contain extremely massive ( one to few - billion m@xmath8 ) and compact ( radius @xmath17 pc ) starbursts . these dominant compact objects ( dcos )",
    "would appear to be ideal sites for the formation and/or rapid growth of a smbh .",
    "it has been suggested that the seeds of present - day smbhs may be present at the centers of the massive , compact stellar clumps seen in clumpy galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if these lbas indeed host an agn , they would offer the opportunity to study the relationship between the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in detail in objects that appear to be excellent local analogs to a major population of high - redshift galaxies .",

    "the errors for parameters were calculated according to @xmath38 , and the uncertainty of luminosity was proportional to the corresponding error of normalization of each component .",
    "for the three lbas where the temperature was permitted to vary the temperature ranged between 0.3 and 0.6 kev .",

    "the power - law component luminosity in the hard x - ray range ( 2 - 10 kev ) is within a factor of 2 of those derived from the single power - law model spectral fit mentioned above .",
    "this power - law plus thermal model fit makes no statistically significant difference in the derived column density compared to that of the single power - law model .    since the signal - to - noise of the _",
    "_ x__mm - newton   spectra is low , we attempted to constrain any thermal component by simultaneously fitting the spectra of all lbas together assuming that they have approximately the same hot gas temperature , i.e. , we tied the temperature parameters together between the fits but let the ` apec ` normalization vary for each lba .",
    "we also fixed the power - law index at 1.9 , and tied the normalization of power - law component in our fit ( although note that overall normalization for each lba was allowed to be free ) .",

    "we list the intrinsic column density , the thermal luminosity and the soft and hard x - ray luminosity contributed by the power - law component in table [ t : apecjoint ] .",
    "we see that the column densities and thermal luminosities given by this joint fit are consistent with those in the individual fits , but with improved constraints .    in fig .",

    "this comparison was done separately for both the cases in which the spectra were fit individually and those that were fit simultaneously .",
    "these are shown in the left and right panel of fig .",
    "[ f : lxlapec ] respectively .",
    "the results derived from the individual spectra fits imply that these two mechanisms play a nearly equal role in soft x - ray emission , except in j0808 + 3948 where the power - law soft x - ray luminosity is about one dex higher than that of thermal emission . for the joint spectral fit ,",
    "the luminosities from the two emission mechanisms are comparable , within the range of 1 dex .",
    "the obscuration of sdss j0214 + 1259 is compton - thick in the joint fit , and the power - law luminosity at 0.5 - 2 kev is negligible ( not shown ) .",
    "we list the uv luminosity for each lba measured from the om observation in table [ t : uv ] .",

    "relation by a factor of 1.5 to reflect the use of a kroupa rather than a salpeter imf ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting formula is as follows :    @xmath43    in table [ t : sfr ] we compare our sfr derived from the uv luminosity with that derived from a combination of the 24@xmath44 m and h@xmath23 luminosities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . due to the uncertain infrared seds",
    ", no @xmath45-correction was applied to the 24@xmath44 m luminosity in @xcite , and the actual sfrs might be somewhat higher than their derived values .",
    "the uv - derived sfr is lower than that derived from the ir continuum plus optical emission lines .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the uv photons suffer significant dust attenuation and are re - emitted in the ir ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we note that any agn contribution to the uv continuum is negligible in these objects .",
    "this is demonstrated most directly by _ hst _ cos fuv spectra of two of our targets @xcite .",
    "as we described in the introduction , the optical emission - line spectra of our sample of lbas suggest that these may be composite objects consisting of an intense starburst and an obscured agn .",
    "however , this evidence is ambiguous . @xcite",
    "have discussed this in detail and suggest as an alternative that the optical spectra of these galaxies could reflect extreme conditions in the ionized gas related to the presence of a starburst with extreme properties .",
    "the x - ray data we have presented provide important new insight into the nature of these objects .",
    "we begin by comparing the amount of detected hard and soft x - ray emission in the lbas compared to pure starbursts with the same star - formation rates ( as traced by the far - ir luminosity ) .",
    "we will then compare the lbas to typical type 1 and type 2 agn in terms of the ratios of the x - ray to [ o iii ] and mid - ir to [ o iii ] luminosities .",
    "the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity is considered to be a reliable indicator of the global sfr of star forming galaxies . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity has a tight linear correlation with the fir luminosity by investigating a sample of local star forming galaxies .",
    "we show our lbas in the @xmath46 diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ f : sfrlx ] ) with the ranalli relation , which is indicated by the solid line with two dashed lines indicating a factor of 2 above and below .",
    "the hard x - ray luminosities of the lbas are taken from table [ t : cstat ] , which are derived from the absorbed power - law model fit with the photon index fixed at 1.9 .",
    "for comparison , we also show the sample of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirg ) from @xcite and @xcite , where iwasawa et al s sample was divided into two groups of agn and  hard x - ray quiet \" galaxies ( hxq ) indicated by diamond and asterisk symbols respectively , and lehmer et al s sample was indicated by triangle symbols .",
    "we can see that our lbas are about 0.5 to 1 dex above the ranalli et al .",
    "relation , and even more displaced from the non - agn lirgs .",
    "this implies that a normal star forming process would only account for a minority of the hard x - ray emission of these lbas .",
    "we also fit a @xmath47 correlation from our lba sample by applying the survival analysis ( ` asurv ` rev 1.2 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we find similar results in the soft x - ray band .",
    "we fit the correlation between the soft x - ray ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and fir luminosity of our lba sample , and compared it with the result of @xcite .",

    "only part of the soft x - ray flux is likely to be contributed by normal processes associated with star formation .    given that the lbas suffer from less dust extinction than typical local starbursts with similar star - formation rates @xcite , one might worry that the high ratio of x - ray to far - ir luminosity seen in figures 7 and 8 is due to the incomplete conversion of far - uv into far - ir light .",
    "this is not the case . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the star - formation rates derived from the observed far - uv are much smaller than those derived from the far - ir data , implying that the far - ir is a good proxy for the star - formation rate . our results in section 3.2 and figure 6 further support this .",
    "the results from  [ 4.1 ] are consistent with interpreting the optical spectra as indicating the presence of an agn .",

    "the ratios of hard x - ray to [ o iii ] luminosities in the lbas are too low ( by about an - order - of - magnitude ) to be consistent with the values seen in type 1 agn .",
    "however , they do lie within the relatively broad range of values seen in type 2 agn .",
    "the relatively weak hard x - ray luminosity of type 2 agn is due to obscuration of the hard x - rays by the high column densities of gas associated with the agn torus .",
    "in contrast , the [ o iii ] line is formed in the 100 to 1000 pc - scale narrow line region and is not affected by the torus surrounding the black hole .    at first sight ,",
    "the presence of significant obscuration of the hard x - ray emission in the lbas would not be consistent with the relatively low absorbing column densities listed in table [ t : cstat ] .",
    "here we see that the column density derived from the spectral fitting of an absorbed power - law gives the 90% confidence level upper limit at the order of @xmath51 @xmath33 ( @xmath52 @xmath33 for sdss j0802 + 3915 ) .",
    "these columns are much too low to attenuate the hard x - ray emission by @xmath2 an order - of - magnitude .",
    "such a seeming paradox is often seen in type 2 agn and is most likely due to fitting an overly idealized x - ray spectral model .",
    "more realistic models ( e.g. partial covering models and/or models with reprocessing ) @xcite can reconcile the observed x - ray spectrum with heavy obscuration .",
    "alternatively , the actual absorbing column densities derived from the fits to the x - ray spectra may be correct . in this case",
    ", the low ratio of hard x - ray to [ o iii ] luminosities relative to unobscured agn would require that the [ o iii ] line is predominantly produced by the starburst rather than the agn .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this possibility can not be excluded .",
    "assuming for the moment that the relatively high ratios of x - ray to far - ir luminosity indicate that an agn is present in these lbas , our results still do not establish whether this agn is more luminous and heavily obscured in hard x - rays or less luminous and relatively unobscured .",

    "when we removed the gaussian component in the spectral fitting , the @xmath28-stat only increased by 5.5 compared to the value of 109.6/102(dof ) for the model with gaussian .",
    "we then performed the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation to test the significance of the iron emission line from the joint fit .",
    "we generated 6 chains , and the length of each chain is @xmath53 .",
    "the 90% confidence level for the line energy from the mcmc is 6.10 - 6.93 kev , and the estimated upper limit of ew is 2.5 kev .",
    "the histogram distribution of the line energy and normalization parameters is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : mcmc ] .",
    "the significance of the fe k@xmath23 line is calculated as the fraction of non - zero line normalization in the chains , which is found to be 95.3% , i.e. , at the @xmath54 level .",
    "one other test for the presence of a type 2 agn in the lbas is to compare the amount of mid - ir emission expected from a such an agn with the observed [ o iii]@xmath35007 luminosity . @xcite",
    "have shown that both of these are good proxies for the bolometric luminosity of an obscured agn ( unlike the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity ) .    in figure 12",
    "we plot histograms of the ratio of mid - ir/[o iii ] luminosities for the sample of type 2 agn in @xcite and for the lbas in this paper .",
    "the distribution for the type 2 agn has a mean of 1.89 dex and a dispersion of 0.57 dex compared to 2.71 and 0.34 respectively for the lbas .",
    "all six of the lbas lie above the mean value for the type 2 agn .",
    "this suggests that if the lbas are indeed starburst / agn composite systems , the starburst dominates over the agn in the mid - ir in most cases . in a future paper",
    "we will examine this issue in more detail spectroscopically using _ spitzer _ irs data .",
    "note that agn emission from the torus peaks in the mid - ir , while the emission from dusty starbursts peaks in the far - ir ( as is also the case for the lbas ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the bolometric luminosity of the lbas is primarily due to the starburst .",
    "as noted above , it is possible that the [ o iii ] emission in these lbas is primarily produced by the starburst and that the hard x - ray source suffers little attenuation . in this case , the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity will be even smaller .      as discussed in the introduction",
    ", these lba - composites may offer us an unparalleled opportunity to study the processes involved in the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this section we will infer the properties of the supermassive black holes in our sample if galaxies using standard methods .",
    "we will consider two possibilities .",
    "the first is the minimal case in which the hard x - ray source is not obscured . in this case",
    ", the bolometric correction to the hard x - ray luminosity in @xcite leads to a range of agn bolometric luminosities from 1 to 6 @xmath55 l@xmath8 .",
    "the implied black hole masses then range from @xmath56 to @xmath57 m@xmath8 .",
    "if these black holes are indeed radiating near the eddington limit , the implied masses are then in the range of the  intermediate mass \" black holes found in some nearby low - mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the context of the high redshift universe",
    ", similar objects could represent the seeds for the subsequent growth of more massive systems .",
    "the second possibility is that the hard x - rays are significantly obscured in these lbas and that the [ o iii]@xmath35007 emission - line is powered by a type 2 agn . adopting the bolometric correction to the extinction - corrected [ o iii ] luminosity from @xcite then yields agn bolometric luminosities of @xmath58 to @xmath59 l@xmath8 and black hole masses of @xmath60 to @xmath61 m@xmath8 . in this case",
    ", an eddington - limited black hole would have a mass of - order 10@xmath62 of the dco stellar mass @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the mass ratio seen in present - day galactic bulges @xcite .",
    "however , if the [ o iii ] line is contaminated or dominated by the starburst , the agn bolometric luminosity and implied black hole mass would be overestimated .",
    "we present in this paper _ _",
    "x__mm  observations of 6 lyman break analogs ( lbas ) : rare members of a local population that strongly resemble lyman break galaxies at high - redshift in stellar mass , star formation rate , metallicity , size , dust extinction , and velocity dispersion .",
    "our sample consists of lbas whose optical spectra are consistent with a composite system consisting of both an intense starburst and a type 2 ( obscured ) agn",
    ". however , other interpretations of the optical spectra are possible . to further elucidate the nature of these objects we combine our new x - ray data with sdss optical spectra and _ spitzer _ mid- and far - ir photometry .",
    "we summarize the key results as follows :      \\(2 ) we found that the ratios of x - ray to fir luminosity of the lbas are higher than the typical starburst values by factors of three to thirty .",
    "this implies a source of x - ray emission in addition to what is seen in typical starbursts .",
    "we suggest that the most likely candidate would be an agn .",
    "\\(3 ) the ratios of hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) to [ o iii ] luminosity are about an order - of - magnitude smaller than in unobscured ( type 1 ) agn but consistent with the broad range of values seen in type 2 agn .",
    "this might suggest that the hard x - rays suffer a significant amount of attenuation ( as in the case of typical type 2 agn ) .",
    "this would imply that the fitted column densities derived from the simple absorbed power - law model underestimate the true attenuation ( as is often the case in type 2 agn ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the hard x - rays are relatively unobscured and that the [ o iii ] line is primarily produced by an extreme starburst .",
    "\\(4 ) to discriminate between these possibilities ( and provide a confirmation of the presence of an obscured agn ) , we searched for the presence of the 6.4 kev fe k@xmath23 emission line in our lba sample .",
    "however , the limited photon detections and low signal - to - noise ratio do not allow us to come to a strong conclusion .",
    "the mcmc simulation gives a @xmath54 significance level for the iron line and a 90% confidence upper limit of 2.5 kev for the equivalent width .",
    "\\(5 ) we find that the ratio of mid - ir ( 24@xmath44 m ) and [ o iii]@xmath35007 luminosities of the lbas are higher than the values seen in type 2 agn ( by a difference of 0.8 dex in the mean ) .",
    "this would imply that the bolometric luminosity of these systems is primarily due to the starburst rather than an agn . if the [ o iii ] emission is primarily due to a starburst , this conclusion is even stronger .",
    "\\(6 ) given that these objects have significantly higher ratios of x - ray to far - ir luminosity than starbursts , we conclude that the most likely interpretation is that these galaxies are indeed composites of an intense starburst and an agn ( consistent with their optical emission - line spectra ) . if so , the implied black hole masses are of - order @xmath64 m@xmath8 for eddington - limited accretion in the case where the hard x - rays are unobscured and roughly an order - of - magnitude larger for an obscured agn that produces the observed [ oiii ] emission - line",
    ". these may be good analogs to black holes forming in the dense , stellar clumps in galaxies in the early universe .",
