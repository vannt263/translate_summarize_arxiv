    "we can now use eq .   to decompose the scattering rate into contributions for different plasmon modes",
    "this is what is shown in the lower panels of the figure for ( c ) the cigar , ( d ) the disk , and ( e ) the sphere .",
    "each point in the density plots corresponds to a given molecule - particle distance and plasmon energy , and we have introduced a broadening of the order of @xmath48 for each plasmon mode .",
    "the colors indicate the relative importance of the different plasmon modes . for the cigar - shaped particle ,",
    "we observe in panel ( c ) that up to very small distances it is primarily the dipole surface plasmon mode that couples to the molecule .",
    "this is because of the large energy separation between the plasmon modes of lowest energy , and the resulting weak coupling to the off - resonant modes . only for the smallest distances the coupling constants @xmath137 dominate over the detunings @xmath154 .",
    "similar behavior is observed in panel ( d ) for the disk - shaped particle .",
    "things are different in panel ( e ) showing results for the sphere . because of the small energy separation between the different surface plasmon modes , already at relatively small distances , say around 0.1 in units of the sphere diameter , the molecule starts to significantly excite the higher - lying plasmon modes . as consequence ,",
    "the quantum yield dramatically drops at these distances .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly discussing frster energy resonance transfer ( fret ) in presence of nanoparticles . here",
    "a donor and acceptor molecule exchange energy through dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "this process become drastically enhanced if the molecules can benefit from the nearfield enhancement of the metallic nanoparticle @xcite . for given donor and acceptor dipole moments @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the enhancement of the fret process can be computed from @xmath157 @xmath158 and @xmath159 denote the positions of the donor and acceptor molecule , and @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the dyadic green functions in presence and absence of the nanoparticle . in our approach",

    "[ sec : bem ] . note that the denominator in eq .",
    "is precisely the free - space dipole - dipole coupling .",
    "figure [ fig : fret ] shows the fret enhancement for a disk - shaped nanoparticle and for a molecular transition frequency equal to the dipole surface plasmon energy .",
    "the positions of the donor molecules are indicated in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . for simplicity , in the plot",
    "we assume that the acceptor molecules are placed on a sheet , and we have averaged over all orientation of the donor and acceptor molecules .",
    "the fret transfer becomes enhanced by up to four orders of magnitude , in particular for transfer processes across the nanoparticle .",
    "here , the donor and acceptor molecule exchange their energy via the resonant surface plasmon mode .",
    "note that in order to estimate the fret efficiency we additionally have to consider the enhancement of the radiative and nonradiative decay processes , as discussed in ref .",
    "in summary , we have developed a general framework , based on a suitable description of quantum electrodynamics in the presence of absorbing media and a general boundary element method approach , for the description of the modified molecular dynamics in presence of metallic nanoparticles . within the quasistatic limit",
    "the decay rate has been separated into radiative and non - radiative decay channels , which both obey a simple scaling behavior .",
    "we have discussed different nanoparticle discretizations , and have shown that reliable results can only be obtained for properly defined surface discretizations . from a comparison with mie theory",
    "we have estimated an errorbar of less than ten percent for our numerical results .",
    "we have performed an eigenmode expansion for the surface plasmons , and have shown that the higher quantum yield for quasi one- and two - dimensional nanoparticles can be attributed to the large energy splitting of the corresponding eigenmodes .",
    "finally , we have shown that significant enhancements of the frster transfer rates can be expected for donor and acceptor molecules placed in the vicinity of the nanoparticle .",
    "we are grateful to joachim krenn and alfred leitner for most helpful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we provide some details for the derivation of the fermi - golden - rule result .",
    "as we are dealing with an open system , i.e. , a molecule interacting with the continuum of photon modes , we have to adopt a density - matrix description @xcite .",
    "we assume that the molecule is initially in the state @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding density operator is of the form @xmath162 .",
    "the total density operator @xmath163 has to additionally account for the degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic environment .",
    "let us make the usual assumption that at time zero the molecule is decoupled from the electromagnetic environment .",
    "the total density operator then factorizes @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the density operator of the electromagnetic _ reservoir _ which we consider to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath166 follows from the liouville von - neumann equation @xmath167 $ ] , which we have written in the interaction representation with @xmath168 the light - matter coupling of eq .  .",

    "the four terms explicitly given on the right - hand side of eq .   correspond to photon emissions , and those resulting from the exchange of @xmath176 with @xmath177 to photon absorptions . as in this work we will be dealing with electromagnetic fields in the visible regime and room temperature",
    ", we can safely ignore the thermal occupation of the radiation modes , and thus neglect absorption processes of thermal photons throughout .",
    "let us assume that the dipole operators oscillate with the molecular transition frequency @xmath178 according to @xmath179 .",
    "in addition , we introduce the fourier transform of the field operators @xmath180 we will use the same symbol @xmath18 for the field operators in time and frequency space as long as there is no danger of confusion . for sufficiently large times",
    "@xmath181 , where @xmath182 is fulfilled , we can replace the lower limit @xmath0 in the time integration by @xmath183 .",
    "this replacement is called the _ adiabatic approximation _",

    "its appearance has nothing to do with a real damping process .",
    "rather it allows to perform the adiabatic limit in the integration _",
    "prior _ to the thermodynamic limit in the expectation value @xmath187 @xcite . finally , in the last expression on the right hand side of eq .",
    "we have only considered dirac s delta function , which accounts for the energy conservation in the scattering processes , and have neglected the cauchy principal value .",
    "the latter contribution is responsible for an energy shift of the molecular transition , usually known as the _ lamb shift _",
    "@xcite , which could be incorporated into a renormalized @xmath178 . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the expectation value of the field operators @xmath188 is diagonal in frequency space .",
    "putting together all the results and changing back from the interaction to the schrdinger representation , then brings us to the master equation @xmath189-    \\pi\\left < \\hat e_i^+(\\omega_0)\\hat e_j^-(\\omega_0)\\right>\\nonumber\\\\    & \\times &    \\left(\\hat d_i^-\\hat d_j^+\\,\\hat\\rho+\\hat\\rho\\,\\hat d_i^-\\hat d_j^+    -2\\hat d_j^+\\,\\hat\\rho\\,\\hat d_i^-\\right)\\,.\\,\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right hand side accounts for the free propagation of the molecule , and the second term for scattering processes due to the coupling to the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the terms in parentheses are reminiscent of the lindblad master equation . finally ,",
    "using the explicit form for the dipole operators and taking the matrix elements @xmath190 of the operator equation , we find that the upper - state population of the molecule decays according to @xmath191 , with the decay rate @xmath48 given in eq .  .",
    "in this appendix we provide some details of how to relate the current correlation function @xmath192 to the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the metal .",
