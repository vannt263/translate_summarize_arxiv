    "most local moment magnets undergo a transition from a high temperature paramagnetic state to a magnetically long range ordered state below some critical temperature .",
    "the ordered state is like a solid while the paramagnetic state is like the gaseous state .",
    "the state analogous to a liquid is elusive in magnets .",
    "that is because most magnetic solids have a unique state with the lowest energy and are able to freeze into that solid - like long range ordered state at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "if one is able to suppress this tendency to order , one could attain a liquid like state of spins where they would be strongly entangled and yet dynamically fluctuating down to @xmath12 .",
    "this can be achieved by enhancing quantum fluctuations which can melt the magnetic solid .",
    "one way of constructing such a quantum spin - liquid ( qsl ) is by arranging the magnetic moments on low dimensional or geometrically frustrated lattices .",
    "indeed , qsl s were first demonstrated to exist for quasi - one - dimensional spin chains like kcuf@xmath13 and sr@xmath14cuo@xmath13 ( see refs .   for experimental reviews ) .",

    "after the initial heat treatment , the material was reground and pressed into a pellet and given two heat treatments of @xmath24  h each at @xmath27c , with an intermediate grinding and pelletizing step .",
    "the pellet was always brought to room temperature by quenching in argon .",
    "hard well sintered pellets were obtained which are dark green in color .",

    "this upturn moves up in temperature and develops into a complete peak at @xmath87  t. the peak then moves to higher temperatures for larger @xmath6 .",
    "the broad peak is very unlike that expected for a second order phase transition where a @xmath88-like anomaly is usually seen in the heat capacity .",

    "a low temperature anomaly in the heat capacity which moves up in temperatures on the application of magnetic field is a hallmark of frustrated magnets in general .",
    "for example , in addition to the above materials , the pyrochlore spin - ice material pr@xmath14zr@xmath14o@xmath1 also shows an anomaly in the heat capacity at @xmath104  k which is attributed to the formation of a collective spin - ice state .",
