    "<S> in the language of differential geometry , the incompressible inviscid euler equations can be written in vorticity - vector potential form as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vorticity @xmath2-form , @xmath3 denotes the lie derivative with respect to the velocity field @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the hodge laplacian , @xmath6 is the codifferential ( the negative of the divergence operator ) , and @xmath7 is the canonical map from @xmath2-forms to @xmath2-vector fields induced by the euclidean metric @xmath8 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider a generalisation of these euler equations in three spatial dimensions , in which the vector potential operator @xmath9 is replaced by a more general operator @xmath10 of order @xmath11 ; this retains the lagrangian structure of the euler equations , as well as most of its conservation laws and local existence theory . despite this </S>",
    "<S> , we give three different constructions of such an operator @xmath10 which admits smooth solutions that blow up in finite time , including an example on @xmath12 which is self - adjoint and positive definite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a barrier to establishing global regularity for the three - dimensional euler equations , in that any method for achieving this must use some property of those equations that is not shared by the generalised euler equations considered here . </S>"
