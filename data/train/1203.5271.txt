    "( ra = 21:38:17.3 , dec = + 57:31:23 , j2000 ) is a solar type variable in tr37 .",
    "the star has a spectral type of g7 to k0 , an estimated mass of 2.1  m@xmath5 and a radius of 36  r@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the youth of gmcep is exemplified by its emission - line spectrum , prominent infrared excess @xcite , and x - ray emission @xcite , all characteristics of a ctts .",
    "the star has a circumstellar disk @xcite , with an accretion rate up to @xmath6  m@xmath5  yr@xmath7 , which is 23 orders higher than the median value of the cttss in tr37 @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the fastest rotators in the cluster , with @xmath8  km  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "most pms objects are variables .",
    "@xcite classified such variability into three categories .",
    "one class of variation is caused by rotational modulation of cool star spots .",
    "another class of variation arises because of unsteady accretion onto a hot spot on the stellar surface ; stars of this type are called exors , with ex lupi being the most extreme case .",
    "stars with the third kind of variation , called ux orionis type variables or uxors , are those which experience variable obscuration by circumstellar dust clumps .",
    "about a dozen uxors have been identified so far , with some showing cyclic variability with periods ranging from 8.2  days @xcite to 11.2  years @xcite .",
    "gmcep is known to be an abrupt variable , but interpretations on its variability have been controversial .",
    "@xcite collected photometry of the star from 1952 to 2007 in the literature , supplementing with their own intensive multi - wavelength observations , and suggested gmcep to be an exor type variable , i.e. , with outbursts and accretion flares . @xcite measured archival plates taken between 1895 and 1993 , and concluded otherwise  that the variability in the century - long light curve is dominated by dips ( possibly from extinction ) superposed on quiescent states . if this is the case , gmcep should be a uxor type variable , as claimed also by @xcite .",
    "gmcep has been observed by the young exoplanet transit initiative ( yeti ) collaboration , a network of small telescopes in different longitude zones @xcite .",
    "in addition to the yeti data , the observations reported here also included those collected during non - yeti campaign time , by the slt 40-cm telescope at lulin in taiwan , the tenagra  ii 81-cm telescope , in arizona , usa , the jena university observatory 25  cm and 90/60  cm telescopes in germany , and the 1.5  m telescope of moleitai observatory in lithuania .",
    "for the list of yeti telescope and instrument parameters , please refer to @xcite . while the primary goal of the yeti campaigns , each with uninterrupted monitoring of a target cluster for 710 days , is to search for exoplanet transit events in young open clusters  hence finding possibly the youngest exoplanets  the continuous and high - cadence observations produce data sets also valuable for young stellar variability study much relevant to planet formation @xcite . here",
    "we present the light curve of gmcep from 2009 to 2011 that reveals t  tauri - type flares and uxor - type variability , with the possible detection of cyclic occultation events by a dust clump in the circumstellar disk .",
    "all the ccd images were processed by the standard procedure of bias , dark and flatfield correction .",
    "the photometry of gmcep was calibrated by a linear regression with the seven comparison stars listed by @xcite .",
    "images taken under inferior sky conditions were excluded in the analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig:01 ] shows the light curves of gmcep and one of the comparison stars observed from mid-2009 to mid-2011 .",
    "the variability of gmcep is obvious .",
    "the star experienced a sharp brightening soon after our observations started in mid-2009 , prompting us to follow this star closely beyond the yeti campaigns .",
    "our intense monitoring started in 2010 . a brightness dip , with a depth of @xmath9  mag , lasting for 39  days , occurred , followed by gradual brightening ( by @xmath2  mag ) and fading .",
    "the falling and rising parts of the dip are roughly symmetric . in 2011",
    ", a dip also happened , but with rapid fluctuations .",
    "the star fluctuated some @xmath10  mag in 2010 and also in 2009 .",
    "we conclude that the sharp brightening in 2009 corresponded to the rising part of the dip seen in 2010 .",
    "if so , the recurrent time scale of the dip would be 346  days , and the minimum of the dip brightened from 2009 ( @xmath11  mag ) , 2010 ( @xmath12  mag ) , to 2011 ( @xmath13  mag ) .",
    "when this trend is taken out , the gradual brightening and fading is more or less symmetric in time with the peak luminosity happening between two consecutive dips , much like the round - topped light curves seen in contact binaries .",
    "such repeated dips plus a slow brightening and fading can be seen in the long - term light curve reported by @xcite , who claimed no periodicity in the data perhaps because of the sparse sampling of the data .",
    "figure  [ fig:02 ] shows the light curves of gmcep in @xmath14 bands since late 2006 , with additional data taken from @xcite and aavso .",
    "analysis by the nsted ( nasa / ipac / nexsci star and exoplanet database ) periodogram service , based on the lomb - scargle algorithm , shows the first - ranked peroid to be 311  d with a broad peak in the power spectrum , suggesting a quasi - periodicity , as shown in figure  [ fig:03 ] .",
    "such a recurrence time scale of 310320  d indeed seems to coincide with the minima in the light curve ( see figure  [ fig:02 ] ) at least for the last 5 cycles for which sampling has been sufficiently dense @xcite . in addition ,",
    "superimposed on the above light variations , there are sporadic flaring - like episodes with amplitude less than 0.5  mag , each lasting for about 10  d , characteristic of t  tauri activity .",

    "the light curve of gmcep is characterized by ( 1 )  a brightness dip of about 1  mag lasting for a month , with a recurrence time scale of about a year , ( 2 )  in between the dips , a gradual brightening of about 1  mag , followed by a roughly symmetric fading , and superimposed on the above two , ( 3 )  intermittent flares @xmath1  mag , each lasting for several days .",

    "the abrupt behavior in gmcep s light curve is not uncommon among herbig ae / be stars , with modulations of various time scales , i.e. , `` cyclic but not exactly periodic '' @xcite , superimposed on deep minima .",
    "a flare with a blue color can be accounted for by enhanced accretion of clumpy material .",
    "@xcite published the @xmath19 light curves of gmcep covering from mid-2008 , i.e. , one year earlier , but in lower cadence , than our data .",
    "their data showed @xmath20  mag in 2008 with no obvious dips , an obscuration event in 2009 , and another one in 2010 .",
    "these authors proposed that gmcep is a uxor variable . at the end of their observations , in early 2011 ,",
    "the star reached again @xmath20  mag , shown also in our data .",
    "the most striking feature of the light curve of gmcep is the month - long dips .",
    "there are various possible mechanisms to produce such a phenomenon , e.g. , by star spots or a rotating accretion column , which has a typical time scale of a few hours to days .",
    "a notable case , the t  tauri star aatau , is known to show deep fading ( @xmath21  mag ) lasting for about a week , believed to be caused by occultation by a warp in the magnetospheric accretion disk @xcite , with a quasi - cyclic time scale of 8.2  d @xcite .",
    "the dip phenomenon appears to be common among young stars with inner dusty disks @xcite . in a study by corot satellite of the young star cluster ngc2264",
    ", @xcite found a fraction of 3040% young stars exihibiting obscuration variations .",
    "we propose that the month - long dip seen in gmcep is a manifestation of obscuration by an orbiting dust concentration in the circumstellar disk , i.e. , gmcep is a uxor - type variable , as reported by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "if so , the orbital period of the dip gives information on the distance of the clump from the star , whereas the duration of the obscuration and amount of starlight extinction , give , respectively , the size and the column density of the clump .",
    "the mass of the star is uncertain for this pms star , but assuming 2.1  m@xmath5 @xcite , a keplerian motion , and a period of @xmath22=320  days , the orbital distance of the clump would be @xmath23  au .",
    "the duration of the obscuration @xmath24  days is related to the half - size of the clump @xmath25 by @xmath26 ; hence @xmath27  au , or about 1530 stellar radii @xcite .",
    "the extinction @xmath28 at wavelength @xmath29 is related to the amount of obscuring dust along the line of sight , i.e. , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the column density of the dust grains , @xmath32 is the geometric cross section of a grain of a radius of @xmath33 @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the dimensionless extinction efficiency factor .",
    "stars as young as gmcep should have large grains settled into the midplane , but because the disk is inclined @xcite , we assume that the obscuration is caused mostly by small dust grains with an average radius of @xmath36 m , thus @xmath37 , cautiously noting the possibility of abnormal dust sizes in the disk @xcite .",
    "it follows from the observed obscuration of @xmath38  mag in the @xmath15 band that @xmath39 .",
    "this amount of intervening dust is hardly excessive .",
    "the flux drop during the dip phase , @xmath2  mag , is comparable to the extinction of the star @xmath40 @xcite , a value commonly seen among cttss .",
    "the moderate extinction also indicates a line of sight out of the disk plane .",
    "what is intriguing in gmcep of course is the distinct on - off behavior of the obscuration .",
    "the column mass density is , given the same amount of extinction , proportional to the dust size @xmath33 , and in this case is @xmath41 .",
    "even for @xmath42 grains , the column mass density would be still several orders less than the minimum solar nebula , for which @xmath43 is a few thousands @xmath44 at 1  au @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the clump has a line - of - sight ( radial ) dimension comparable to its transverse size ( @xmath45 ) or is merely a ringlet .",
    "even if it is spherical , thus yielding the maximum mass , the mean volume density would be @xmath46 at the clump s center .",
    "given the proximity of the clump to the star ( @xmath47  au ) , we assume the dust composition to be mostly silicates , having an average density of @xmath48g@xmath49 .",
    "this leads to an estimated mass of @xmath50 for the clump , about that of an asteroid , if the mass is uniformly spread . for a clump",
    "this substantial in size , our line of sight does not need to line up to the orbital plane in order to detect the occultation . from the fast rotation , the infrared spectral energy distribution , and the h@xmath51 profile , an intermediate inclination angle",
    "was inferred @xcite .",
    "a clump extending in radial direction would have been tidally unstable .",
    "the clump is thus extended along the orbit , but short radially .",
    "the blueing phenomenon during the obscuration is most puzzling .",
    "it has been seen in uxori itself @xcite and other uxors @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported also the `` color reversal '' or the blueing effect in gmcep , and attributed it to possible anomalous dust properties , or disk geometry such as self - shadowing or a piled up wall in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "one appealing proposal by @xcite is that blueing happens when dust along the line of sight completely dims the star , and dust particles near the line of sight scatter preferentially blue light into the view , a mechanism supported by increased polarization during maximum extinction . in gmcep",
    "when the clump blocks out the star , either the hot boundary layer  a region between the star and the active accretion disk  or the magnetospheric accetion column , must have contributed much to the emission during the dip phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that , except for the flare events , the light curve of gmcep , namely repeated occultation modulated by gradual , symmetric brightening and fading , bears resemblance to that of an eclipsing binary or an exoplanet transit with phase variations @xcite , though the time and flux change scales are vastly different . in gmcep",
    "the flares are caused by enhanced accretion activity , and the dip , as we propose here , by occultation of the central star by a patch of dust in the circumstellar disk .",
    "the gradual brightening and fading , then , is the result of the orbital modulation of reflected starlight , as witnessed in high - precision light curves of eclipsing binaries or transiting exoplanets @xcite . without the shape information of the clump , it is difficult to quantify this effect .",
    "but the amount of reflected light allows us to estimate the height of the clump .",
    "if the yearly brightening trend in 20092011 is removed , the gradual brightening in 2010 amounted to @xmath52  mag , meaning approximately an equal contribution between the reflected light and the direct starlight . without knowledge on the density distribution and optical properties of dust",
    ", we made a simple analogy of dust grains as a translucent mirror , made up of a total number of @xmath53 particles . assuming the bond albedo @xmath54 , the reflected light is @xmath55 , and an ensemble of dust on the back side of , and 1.2  au away from",
    ", the star would yield @xmath56 .",
    "a rudimentary estimate , assuming an albedo of 4% ( cometary nuclei ) thus gives a height not much less than the perimetrical dimension .",
    "if our hypothesis holds , that the same clump has been responsible for the yearly dip , the clump must be dynamically stable .",
    "the mass we derived is only for the dust , and there is no evidence , even with a sufficient amount of associated gas , that the clump is on the verge of gravitational instability @xcite . in any case , the density of the clump is not likely to have a high contrast relative to the rest of the disk . in other words , it may be just a density inhomogeneity , such as a local dust concentration in a warped , spiral - armed disk or density enhancement by a companion star @xcite , that gives rise to the characteristic light curve seen in gmcep .    in conclusion",
    ", our photometric monitoring of gmcep confirms its uxor nature .",
    "moreover , the light curves and color variations suggest density inhomogeneity of dust in the young stellar disk . such enhanced density contrast may be a signpost of the transition phase from grain growth to the onset of planetesimal formation .",
    "gmcep may not be an isolated example , and intense monitoring should be carried out for young stars known to exhibit abrupt light variations .",
    "further characterization of the clumpy disk of gmcep , e.g. , by polarization , infrared spectroscopy , and high angular resolution submillimeter imaging , at epochs in and out of the occultation , should shed light on our hypothesis of this interesting young star .",
