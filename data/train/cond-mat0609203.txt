    "in a recent paper , lipowski and lipowska  @xcite considered a generalisation of the geometric tsp by adding a new term to the cost function : @xmath0 the familiar term @xmath1 of the traditional tsp is the total path length of a cyclic tour defined by some permutation of the @xmath2 city indices .",
    "the new term @xmath3 is a measure of the distance of the tour from the centre of the geometry .",
    "here we shall only consider the two - dimensional problem in a square domain , and shall take this centre , the origin of the city coordinates , @xmath4 , to be the centre of the square .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 , @xmath6 , specifies the relative strength of each term .",
    "the authors of @xcite gave example motivations for the centred model , but the fact that they found a transition as @xmath5 is varied and were able to identify it as a complexity transition provides sufficient interest .",
    "specifically , they used simulated annealing techniques to numerically study zero temperature optimum configurations .",
    "while these configurations appear similar to standard tsp tours for small @xmath5 , the picture is rather different at large @xmath5 . for @xmath7 , rather than connecting near neighbour cities ( @xmath8 ) , the tour connects cities lying on points that are almost inverted with respect to the origin ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this change in character can be seen directly though an observable measuring the angle between successive links of the tour : at small @xmath5 the angle is not especially biased in any direction ( though boundary effects cause a slight preference for acute angles ) , while at large @xmath5 there is a distinct preference for links to double back on themselves .",
    "sharp changes in quantities such as @xmath10 as @xmath5 is varied suggest a phase transition .",
    "moreover , this transition was identified as a complexity transition  @xcite , since the simulated annealing schedule required to reach optima in the ( large @xmath5 ) c - phase is much less stringent than that required in the ( small @xmath5 ) l - phase , indicating a difference in characteristic difficulty of the problem as the transition is crossed .",
    "complexity transitions have recently been of strong interest to computer scientists , combinatorial optimists and physicists , and although a transition has already been identified @xcite in other versions of the tsp , the geometric basis and simplicity of this centred model are very appealing .",
    "many questions about the nature of the transition remain , and the aim of this paper is to investigate the model using analytic techniques recently developed to study the statistical mechanics of tsp - like models  @xcite . these techniques allow a full solution of the theory in the region of high city density and finite temperature . in particular , expectation values for the path length @xmath10 and its fluctuations can be computed and these provide evidence for a smoothed transition at finite temperature .",
    "the technique is not able to access the optima at low temperature and we can not use it to compute critical indices for example . nonetheless , our methods produce other insights such as a duality ; @xmath11 between thermodynamic quantities that may have a role beyond the region of applicability of the technique .",
    "the analytic techniques we use to solve the model were derived in @xcite using a functional formalism and have since been placed on a firm basis via a discrete approach @xcite .",
    "the continuum equations for a system of unit area and a flat distribution of cities allow the free energy to be written in terms of a quantity @xmath12 which is defined by an integral equation , @xmath13\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : continuum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observables can now be obtained by standard thermodynamic relations .",
    "for example the expectation values for the total length of the path and its fluctuations are given by , @xmath14\\right)\\\\ \\langle ( h_l-\\langle h_l \\rangle ) ^2 \\rangle & = &   { \\alpha\\over\\beta}{\\partial \\langle h_l \\rangle \\over \\partial \\alpha } -{\\partial \\langle h_l \\rangle \\over \\partial \\beta } \\label{eq : expectations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these expressions are proportional to @xmath2 in contrast to the expected dependence of the optimum configurations .",
    "for example , the optimum path length for the standard ( @xmath15 ) tsp grows as @xmath16 , and for @xmath17 has more complex @xmath2 dependence reported in  @xcite . along with the non - extensive @xmath18 entropy ,",
    "this scaling makes it already clear that the region within which the technique is valid is restricted .",
    "similar formulae hold for expectations of @xmath3 , but in all cases we find that the solution of the integral equation ( [ eq : continuum ] ) , obeys a duality relation : @xmath19 this duality is a consequence of the symmetry that inverts with respect to the centre , @xmath20 , and interchanges @xmath21 . as a result , @xmath22 so expectations of @xmath3 are simply related to those of @xmath1 , for example , @xmath23 .",
    "one immediate result of the duality is that if any transition occurs , it must be at @xmath24 .",
    "we shall return to discuss whether this duality holds outside the range of validity of the equations ( [ eq : continuum ] ) .",
    "= 0.5    it has not been possible to analytically solve the integral equation ( [ eq : continuum ] ) , but an iterative procedure on a discretised version converges rapidly and is numerically stable .",
    "monte carlo simulations independently confirm the results and are shown in the figures below . at the lowest temperatures it becomes hard to equilibrate the monte carlo and we omit the @xmath25 data . in figure ( [ lvev ] ) the expectation value of the length per link",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath5 , for a variety of temperatures .",
    "evidently this tends towards a step function and is a smoothed out version of the zero temperature result shown in reference @xcite .",
    "= 0.5    fluctuations in the path length also grow as @xmath2 and figure ( [ lfluct ] ) shows how @xmath26 changes with @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity is numerically more delicate than the simple average , but although it can be computed by solving linear equations for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we have simply evaluated the expression in ( [ eq : expectations ] ) with discrete derivatives .",
    "the monte carlo also suffers from large sample to sample fluctuations at low temperature .",
    "as the temperature is reduced , a peak starts to appear at @xmath29 .",
    "other quantities such as correlations between angles between successive links have also been computed within this formalism and agree with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the computations are interesting in that they show how to generalise the methods of @xcite to compute correlations along the path , however they do not throw any further light on this problem and its transition .",
    "although no general analytic solution of the integral equations has been found , the low temperature limit can be understood using a saddle point at large @xmath30 . because the formalism does not scale temperature  @xcite this low temperature limit does not correspond to the tsp optimum .",
    "writing @xmath31 , the stationarity condition of the exponent at large @xmath30 is : @xmath32\\ ] ] a solution exists with @xmath33 linear in @xmath34 , matching the tendency of the iterative numerical solutions at low temperature .",
    "the prefactor @xmath35 , can also be determined based on linear rather than the usual quadratic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the resulting solution obeys duality : @xmath36 the resulting expectation values have sharp changes at the transition point .",
    "for example , @xmath37 the length fluctuations develop a delta function singularity at @xmath29 , with leading coefficient proportional to @xmath38 , @xmath39 the height of the fluctuation peak as determined by the iterative solution of the integral equation at fixed @xmath40 appears first to grow as @xmath30 as the temperature is reduced , but eventually this @xmath38 behaviour is observed .",
    "the method of @xcite for studying the statistical mechanics of tsp - like problems has been applied to the centred tsp .",
    "both numerical solutions of the equations at finite temperature and the limiting behaviour at large @xmath30 provide evidence supporting the transition observed though numerical study of optimum configurations in @xcite .",
    "the method is not able to reach the region where optimal configurations dominate and the character of the evidence is a smoothed signal of the transition indicating that the transition point lies at a temperature below that accessible by this technique .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the solutions is a duality , @xmath41 , relating observables on either side of the transition .",
    "this duality can be understood in terms of the density of states : the number of cyclic tours with @xmath1 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the same as the number of tours with @xmath3 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where in this regime of high city density and high temperature , @xmath42 should not be too small .",
    "this kind of relationship also exists between a particular pair of one - dimensional hamiltonians  @xcite in which the configurations are also specified by permutations of @xmath2 indices .",
    "however , in that case , even at finite @xmath2 , a map between a configuration with a certain value of one hamiltonian and another configuration with the same value for the other hamiltonian was demonstrated .",
    "a brief consideration of particular instances of the @xmath44 case shows that this precise relationship can not hold for the centred two - dimensional tsp , so the duality must only be valid in the large @xmath2 limit . within the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "even if the duality holds for optima and near optima outside the regime of high temperature , the lack of a clear map prevents one from using the @xmath45 model on the easy side of the transition to solve the hard tsp at @xmath46 ."
