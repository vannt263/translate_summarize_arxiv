    "if we perturb an initially planar deflagration front , the perturbations grow because of the dl instability bending the front . at the nonlinear stage ,",
    "the dl instability increases the deflagration velocity ; recent reviews on the dl instability in flames may be found in , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs.@xcite .",
    "the classical dl theory considers an infinitesimally thin deflagration front in an incompressible flow @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first attempt to study the influence of gas compression on the dl instability was made in ref.@xcite .",
    "reference @xcite treated compression effects as small corrections to the classical dl theory .",
    "this is reasonable for chemical flames , since even relatively fast laboratory flames have the mach number much smaller than unity both in the fuel mixture and in the burnt gas .",
    "however , there is an important example of deflagration with intrinsically strong compression effects ; this is laser ablation in inertial confined fusion @xcite . in laser ablation ,",
    "the isothermal mach number is one at the critical surface , where the laser radiation is partly absorbed and partly reflected by the fusion plasma . due to this",

    "in inertial confined fusion , the dl instability typically appears together with the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability @xcite .",
    "quite often the dl instability is overwhelmed by the rt instability because of the large acceleration of the plasma targets .",
    "still , taking sufficiently large targets , one obtains a small acceleration , which tends to zero for an infinitely large target . in that case",

    "@xcite did not state this finding openly ; for the first time it was done much later in ref .",
    "since then , there has been much interest to the dl instability in inertial confined fusion both in the theory @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite . in the theoretical papers @xcite the incompressible approximation",
    "was used , which may be considered only as a qualitative model for the ablation flow .",
    "the influence of compression effects on the dl instability in laser ablation has been considered only recently @xcite , where , unfortunately , the plasma compression was treated only as second - order corrections to the incompressible solution . moreover ,",
    "the second - order corrections in refs .",
    "@xcite concerned only terms proportional to the deflagration thickness ; this thickness is infinitesimal in the classical dl theory .",
    "such an approach can therefore not describe properly the dl instability in laser ablation .",
    "one should expect considerable modifications of the dl theory because of the flow compression already for a discontinuous deflagration front .",

    "the above problems with the dl theory in a compressible flow are not surprising , cf .  the rt instability in inertial confined fusion .",
    "it is well - known that the model of a discontinuous ablation front used to study the rt instability contains a deficit in the boundary conditions @xcite : the number of unknown values exceeds the number of conservation laws at the front by one .",

    "@xcite is incorrect : it contradicts the conservation laws at the deflagration front . in order to resolve the problem , ref .",
    "@xcite took into account energy conservation at the front , which provided one extra condition .",

    "this assumption may be treated as a hidden additional boundary condition in the analysis of ref .",
    "thus , we come to the question : what is the correct additional boundary condition at a fast deflagration front , taking into account a possibly strong compression of the plasma or gas . of course , this condition should go over to the dl condition in the case of incompressible flow .",
    "when this question is answered , we face the next issue : what is the influence of plasma compression on the dl instability in laser ablation and fast deflagration ?",
    "does it increase the instability , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , or leave it unchanged like proposed in refs . @xcite ? or may be we have the third option , and compression effects make the instability weaker . the solution presented in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested a combination of these tendencies .",
    "these questions are especially interesting for the chapman - jouguet regime of fast deflagration , for which the velocity of hot plasma or gas is equal to the local sound speed , isothermal or adiabatic .    in the present paper",
    "we solve the problem of the dl instability at a discontinuous deflagration front in a compressible flow .",
    "taking into account the internal structure of the front , we derive the additional boundary condition , which is missing in the model of a discontinuous front .",
    "the derived condition implies constant mass flux at the front ; it reduces to the classical darrieus - landau condition in the limit of incompressible flow .",
    "we demonstrate that the solution to the problem in general depends on the type of energy source . in the case of a strongly localized source ,",
    "compression effects make the dl instability considerably weaker . in particular , the dl instability growth rate",
    "is reduced for laser ablation in comparison with the classical incompressible case .",
    "the instability disappears completely in the adiabatic chapman - jouguet regime of ultimately fast deflagration .",
    "we start with basic hydrodynamic equations describing a plasma ( gas ) flow in the absence of gravity @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 and the equation of state of an ideal gas @xmath3",
    "we take the equation of energy transfer in the form describing variations of entropy @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are heat capacities at constant volume and pressure , @xmath7 is the adiabatic exponent and @xmath8 is the coefficient of thermal conduction . in general , kinetics of energy release in a deflagration flow may involve additional differential equations specific for a particular type of deflagration .",
    "since it is impossible to consider all particular cases in one paper , here we take energy release described by some function @xmath9 .",
    "most of the results of the present work do not depend on @xmath10 ; we only demand that energy release is strongly localized in a narrow zone inside the deflagration front , which is the usual case",
    ". this demand concerns not only the function @xmath11 , but also the derivatives @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in the case of laser ablation",
    "the energy release is typically presented by @xmath14-function , which implies sufficiently strong localization , e.g. see refs .",
    "we also assume that the function @xmath11 allows a planar stationary solution consisting of two uniform flows of cold heavy plasma ( label `` a '' ) and hot light plasma ( label `` c '' ) separated by a transitional region , which is the deflagration front .",
    "the labels `` a '' and `` c '' originate from the ablation and critical surfaces in the laser deflagration .",
    "typical internal structure of the deflagration front is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . strictly speaking",

    ", we may consider all possible values of the mach number in the light plasma from zero to unity , which would be impossible with a rarefaction wave . besides , the model of two uniform flows separated by the transition region is quite common in the studies of the dl and rt instabilities in laser ablation ,",

    "the structure of sound modes in the hot plasma is modified too . in that case , within the discontinuity approach of @xmath93 , the leading term in ( [ eq23 ] ) is @xmath123 .",
    "this also leads to @xmath124 in the hot plasma instead of the adiabatic relation ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "we also obtain @xmath125 instead of ( [ eq29 ] ) ; and the structure of the acoustic wave in the hot plasma coincides with the incompressible case . the instability growth rate in that case is almost the same as in the incompressible limit : the difference is only in the small terms @xmath126 .",
    "as we can see , taking the energy source in the form ( [ eq54 ] ) with @xmath120 we come to the results close to ref . @xcite and different from the main conclusions of the present paper .",
    "unfortunately , the work @xcite did not specify details of the energy release in the analysis . as another example",

    "( [ eq54 ] ) we recover the main results of the present analysis .",
    "therefore , solution to the stability problem depends on the type of energy release . if the energy release is localized , then we obtain reduction of the dl instability by the compression effects shown in fig .",

    "if the source is not sufficiently localized , then we may obtain increase or decrease of the instability growth rate , or no effect at all , similar to the previous works @xcite .",

    "any attempt to obtain the same result in general by appealing to strong thermal conduction in plasma corona is incorrect as long as one works within the model of a discontinuous front .",
    "we remind that the condition of strong thermal conduction for perturbations implies @xmath133 , which is just the opposite to the condition of a discontinuous front @xmath134 .",
    "taking into account finite deflagration thickness and thermal conduction like in @xcite , we can evaluate the cut - off wavelength of the ablation dl instability to be an order of magnitude larger than @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , the dl instability develops on length scales much larger than the distance from the ablation surface to the critical one . at such large length scales",
    "one may not treat sound perturbations as isothermal ones .",
    "thus we come to the question if the energy source is sufficiently localized in laser fusion",

    "electron concentration in plasma is proportional to density @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is mass per one electron .",
