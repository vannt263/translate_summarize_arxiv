    "extreme value theory is now widely applied when modeling block maxima or exceedences over a threshold is of interest . in particular , the generalized pareto distribution ( * gpd * ) describes the limiting distribution of normalized excesses of a threshold as the threshold approaches the endpoint of the variable @xcite .",
    "the gpd has a distribution function defined by :    @xmath0^{-1/\\xi } , x > \\mu , 1 + \\frac{\\xi(x -        \\mu)}{\\sigma } > 0\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the location , scale and shape parameters .    thus , when extreme values must be estimated , this approximation is frequently used .",
    "most applications based on this result are related to environmental sciences , as extreme wind speed @xcite , extreme sea level @xcite or extreme river discharge @xcite .    however , one must often deal with small samples and large uncertainties on estimation .",
    "several publications point out the problem of the shape parameter estimation .",
    "this parameter is of great interest as it determines the tail behaviour of the distribution .",
    "therefore , many authors analyzed the performance of particular estimators given a specified range for the shape parameter : @xcite for the method of moments ; @xcite for the maximum likelihood ; @xcite for the probability weighted moments ;",
    "@xcite for the minimum density power divergence estimator ; @xcite for a proposed generalized maximum likelihood .",
    "however , these results provide the most accurate estimator given the shape parameter ; which is never the case in practice .",
    "therefore , @xcite introduced a systematic way of selecting hyper - parameters for his proposed generalized maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "all these approaches only deal with information from the target site sample .",
    "however , it is frequent in hydrology to perform a regional frequency analysis ( * rfa * ) .",
    "traditional rfa consists of two steps : ( a ) delineation of homogeneous regions i.e. a pooling group of stations with similar behaviour ; ( b ) regional estimation i.e. estimate target site distribution from the regional information .",
    "more recently , bayesian approaches have been applied with success to incorporate regional information in frequency analysis @xcite .",
    "empirical bayesian estimators have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of these approaches is to distinguish the at site information from the other sites data in the estimation procedure .",
    "this is an important point as , no matter how high the homogeneity level may be , the only data which represents perfectly the target site is obviously the target site one .",
    "thus , the whole information available is used more efficiently . in addition , according to @xcite , the bayesian approaches allow to relax the scale invariance property required by the most applied rfa model , that is , the index flood @xcite .",
    "however , a preliminary study on simulated data showed that the approach developed by @xcite may lead to unreliable estimates for larger return periods ( @xmath5 years ) when small samples are involved .",
    "this poor performance is mainly due to the large variance on the shape parameter estimation .",
    "consequently , for such cases , attention must be paid to the regional estimation procedure for the shape parameter .",
    "the basis of our new development was formerly proposed by @xcite .",
    "they use reversible jump markov chain monte carlo techniques @xcite to attribute a non null probability to the gumbel case .",
    "therefore , realizations are not supposed to be gumbel distributed , but have a non null probability to be gumbel distributed .",
    "an application to extreme rainfall and sea - level is given . in this work , this approach is extended to take into account a regional shape parameter , not only the gumbel / exponential case , within a rfa framework .",
    "the reversible jump technique allows to focus on a `` likely '' shape parameter value given by the hydrological relevance of the homogeneous region .",
    "thus , this approach may reduce the shape parameter variance estimation while relaxing the scale invariance property .",
    "the main objectives of this article is first to present new developments in the methodology proposed by @xcite required for a rfa context ; second to assess the quality of two bayesian models based on the index flood hypothesis : the regional bayesian model proposed by @xcite ( @xmath6 ) and the new proposed bayesian approach applying reversible jumps markow chains ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "they are compared to the classical index flood approach of @xcite ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the assessment is developed through a stochastic generation of regional data performed in order to obtain realistic features of homogeneous regions .",
    "detailing the index flood concept is out of the scope of this article .",
    "estimation procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next two sections concentrate on methodological aspects .",
    "section [ sec : methodo ] describes the bayesian framework including the specific markov chain monte carlo ( * mcmc * ) algorithm , required to extend the work by @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : genproc ] presents the simple and efficient algorithm to generate stochastically hydrological homogeneous regions .",
    "a sensitivity analysis is performed in section [ sec : sensanal ] to assess how quantile estimates and related uncertainties are influenced by the values of two parameters of the reversible jump markov chains .",
    "section [ sec : simstud ] compares the performance of each estimator on six representative case studies .",
    "the impact of the bias in the target site index flood estimation is analyzed in section [ sec : effbias ] , while suggestions for building efficient pooling groups are presented in section [ sec : guidregconf ] .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in the bayesian framework , the posterior distribution of parameters must be known to derive quantile estimates .",
    "the posterior distribution @xmath9 is given by the bayes theorem  @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the vector of parameters of the distribution to be fitted , @xmath12 is the parameter space . @xmath13",
    "is the likelihood function , @xmath14 is the vector of observations and @xmath15 is the prior distribution .    in this study ,",
    "as excesses over a high threshold are of interest , the likelihood function @xmath16 is related to the gpd - see equation  .      in this section ,",
    "the methodology to elicit the prior distribution is presented . in this study ,",
    "regional information is used to define the prior distribution .",
    "furthermore , the prior is specific as it must account for a fixed shape parameter @xmath17 with a non null probability @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a sub - space of the parameter space @xmath12 of @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath18 is a hyper - parameter of the prior distribution .",
    "the approach is to construct a suitable prior distribution on @xmath12 ; then , for @xmath18 fixed , to modify this prior to account for the probability of @xmath19 .    for clarity purposes ,",
    "the prior distribution is defined in two steps .",
    "first , an initial prior distribution @xmath21 defined on @xmath12 is introduced .",
    "second , a revised prior distribution @xmath22 is derived from @xmath21 to attribute a non null probability to the @xmath19 sub - sample .      as the proposed model is fully parametric ,",
    "the initial prior distribution @xmath21 is a multivariate distribution entirely defined by its hyper - parameters . in our case study",
    ", the initial prior distribution corresponds to the one introduced by @xcite .",
    "consequently , the marginal prior distributions were supposed to be independent lognormal for both location and scale parameters and normal for the shape parameter .",
    "thus ,    @xmath23\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 are hyper - parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the jacobian of the transformation from @xmath27 to @xmath11 , namely @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the mean vector , @xmath30 is the covariance matrix . as marginal priors are supposed to be independent , @xmath30 is a @xmath31 diagonal matrix with diagonal elements @xmath32 .",
    "hyper - parameters are defined through the index flood concept , that is , all distributions are identical up to an at - site dependent constant .",
    "consider all sites of a region except the target site - say the @xmath33-th site .",
    "a set of pseudo target site parameters can be computed :    @xmath34    for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the target site index flood and @xmath37 are respectively the location , scale and shape at - site parameter estimates from the rescaled sample - e.g. normalized by its respective index flood estimate . under the hypothesis of the index flood concept ,",
    "pseudo - parameters are expected to be distributed as parameters of the target site .",
    "information from the target site sample can not be used to elicit the prior distribution .",
    "thus , @xmath36 in equations   and   must be estimated without use of the @xmath33-th sample site .    in this case study , @xmath36 is estimated through a generalized linear model ( * glm * ) defined by :    @xmath38 & = \\nu , \\qquad \\nu =        x\\beta\\\\        var \\left [ \\log c^{(j ) } \\right ] & = \\phi v(\\nu )      \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 are basin characteristics ( possibly log transformed ) , @xmath40 is the dispersion parameter , @xmath41 the variance function and @xmath42 is the linear predictor . @xcite",

    "indeed large deviations to the area - index flood relationship are often encountered in practice . in the following applications , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "these values arise from a previous study on a french data set  @xcite and ensure realistic magnitudes . for the application of section  [ sec : simstud ] ,",
    "the coefficients of determination for the regressive model   varies from 0.20 to 0.99 , with a mean value of 0.89 .",
    "the histogram of these coefficients of determination is presented in figure  [ fig : histr2 ] .",

    "[ fig : senspmassprobq ] , the quantile estimates distribution seems to be stationary , provided that @xmath100 . introducing a point mass does not impact @xmath101 estimates , whereas significant reduction in median biases and scatter of estimates is noticeable for more extremal quantiles .",
    "[ fig : senspmassprobci ] shows the posterior distributions of return levels and 90% posterior credibility intervals for several @xmath18 values .",
    "it is clear that credibility intervals are sensitive to the @xmath18 value .",
    "this result is consistent as more and more proposals in the mcmc simulation belong to @xmath19 as @xmath18 increases .",
    "thus , by construction , the markov chain is less variable .",

    "in addition , it seems to be more accurate with few but well - instrumented gauging stations rather more but less - instrumented ones .",
    "nevertheless for a light tail , all configurations seems to lead to similar performance levels .",
    "tables  [ tab : guidregconfifl ] ,  [ tab : guidregconfbay ] and  [ tab : guidregconfrev ] show that the estimation of @xmath101 is independent of the region configuration for all estimators . thus , it seems that the regional information is not relevant for quantiles with small non exceedence probabilities .",
    "this article introduced a new bayesian estimator which uses regional information in an innovative way . the proposed model accounts for a fixed regional shape parameter with a non null probability .",
    "thus , as in  @xcite , the regional information is still used to elicit the prior distribution . however , the prior distribution is now a mixture of a gev / gpd and a gev / gpd with only two parameters - the remaining one corresponds to the fixed regional shape parameter .",
    "the estimation procedure is achieved using reversible jump markov chains  @xcite ; and theoretical details for simulated suited markov chains were presented .",
    "a sensitivity analysis for the proposed algorithm was performed .",
    "the results showed that the estimates are consistent provided that the probability attributed to the fixed regional shape parameter is positive .",
    "in addition , as noticed by  @xcite , the credibility intervals are sensitive to this probability value .",
    "thus , the proposed estimator relates this probability value to the homogeneity degree of the region - using the heterogeneity statistic of  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the credibility intervals take into account the belief about the fixed regional shape parameter to be the true value .",
    "a performance analysis was carried out on stochastic data for three different estimators .",
    "for this purpose , another algorithm which generates stochastic homogeneous regions was implemented .",
    "the good overall performance of the proposed estimator has been demonstrated .",
    "indeed , on one hand , this approach combines the accuracy of the regional bayesian approach of  @xcite for quantiles associated to small exceedence probabilities . on the other hand",
    ", the duality of the prior distribution ( and the fixed regional shape parameter ) allows the proposed estimator to be at least as efficient as the index flood model .",
    "thus , this new estimator seems very suited for regional estimation when the target site is not well instrumented .",
    "furthermore , the two bayesian approaches considered here appear to be less sensitive to biases on target site index flood estimation than the index flood estimator .",
    "thus , the bayesian approaches are more readily adaptable which is a major advantage as errors on the index flood estimation are often uncontrollable .",
    "as noticed by  @xcite , the index flood model does not use information optimally .",
    "this point is corroborated in this study as the model initiated by  @xcite is not inevitably more accurate as the information within the pooling group increases .",
    "this is not the case for the bayesian approaches .",
    "in addition , they seem to be more accurate when dealing with regions with well instrumented sites , particularly for large quantiles .    all statistical analysis were carried out by use of  @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , the algorithm presented in section  [ subsec : postest ] was incorporated in the * evdbayes * packages  @xcite .",

    "in this section , the metropolis - hastings algorithm is presented . according to the results derived by @xcite , some details will be given to consider the reversible jump case .",
    "the basic idea of the metropolis - hastings algorithm is to obtain a markov chain that converges to a known stationary distribution .",
    "the strength of the metropolis - hasting approach is that the convergence is reached whatever the initial state of the markov chain is and that the distributions could be known up to a constant .",
