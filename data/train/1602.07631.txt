    "propagation of sound pulses and sound beams in weakly nonlinear media with account of small curvature of wave fronts is of considerable interest for many applications in science and industry from geology to medicine ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "mathematical theory of propagation of nonlinear sound pulses is often based on the study of the so - called khokhlov - zabolotskaya ( kz ) equation .",
    "if we denote , say , the flow velocity of the medium at a point @xmath0 at a moment @xmath1 as @xmath2 , then the kz equation can be written in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the axis of propagation of a sound pulse , @xmath5 is the sound velocity of linear waves in the medium under consideration , @xmath6 is the laplace operator in directions normal to the propagation direction , i.e. , @xmath7 in 2d - geometry and @xmath8 in 3d - geometry , and subscripts denote derivatives with respect to corresponding variables .",
    "in fact , this equation appeared first in the paper @xcite in the context of the theory of compressible gas flow past a thin wing but at that time it was not related with the problem of propagation of strong sound pulses .",
    "later it was derived by a.p .",
    "sukhorukov in framework of nonlinear physics studies that were performing in r.v .",
    "khokhlov group and was published in @xcite .",
    "the name _ khokhlov - zabolotskaya equation _ was coined by o.v .",
    "rudenko and early history of this equation is described in much detail in his paper @xcite .",
    "after the soliton theory arose in 70 s , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for a particular case of two spatial coordinated ( @xmath4 and @xmath9 ) has drawn much attention as a dispersionless limit of the famous kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation and the name _ kz equation _ has become commonly accepted .    both for applications and mathematical theory of nonlinear waves",
    "it is important to have methods of finding physically reasonable solutions of the kz equation and of other equations of the same type .",
    "first approximate solutions of this equation were studied already in the papers @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "methods related with the complete integrability of the kz equation ( dispersionless limits of the kp equation ) were developed , for example , in @xcite and in these papers some interesting exact solutions were presented .",
    "another methods based on the contact geometry approach to nonlinear differential equations were developed in @xcite and they were applied , in particular , to the kz equation and its particular solutions were found .",
    "however , all these methods are mathematically involved and hardly can be used in more general situations important for applications .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a simple and direct method of finding exact solutions of equations of kz type . at first in section 2",
    "we present derivation of particular solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in two- and three - dimensional cases based on physical reasoning .",
    "these solutions coincide with those found in @xcite by much more complicated methods and their form suggests _ ansatz _ for a generalization , developed in section 3 , for finding exact solutions of other equations of this type .",
    "our approach allows us to construct more general solutions than those found in the aforementioned papers and in the recent preprint @xcite . in section 4",
    "we illustrate the general theory by particular examples and in the last section 5 we present conclusions .",
    "although the kz equation has a quite general nature , for definiteness we shall imply here a problem of propagation of a strong sound pulse through a gaseous medium . in the main linear approximation the pulse propagates with the sound velocity @xmath5 . as a variable that describes the wave motion we choose a local flow velocity @xmath10 .",
    "if this motion can be described with a sufficient accuracy as a plane unidirectional wave , then the corresponding wave equation reduces to @xmath11 with obvious solution @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary function that can be determined from the initial condition .",
    "if we take into account weak nonlinear effects , then the sound velocity becomes dependent on the amplitude of the wave and the first approximation for the nonlinear correction to velocity of liquid particles in the wave profile is proportional to the amplitude @xmath10 , @xmath14 where the coefficient @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of the dependence of the pressure @xmath16 on the specific volume @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being the gas density ) as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath19 where the derivative is calculated at the condition that the entropy @xmath20 is constant .",
    "for example , in the case of a polytropic gas we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the heat capacity ratio .",
    "the nonlinear contribution @xmath23 to the velocity leads to an additional displacement of the wave profile points and as a result the solution ( [ eq3 ] ) should be modified as @xmath24.\\ ] ] this equation determines implicitly the dependence of @xmath25 on time and space coordinates for a given function @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , the nonlinear correction transforms the linear equation ( [ eq2 ] ) into the so - called hopf equation @xmath26 whose characteristic equation coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .    for transition to the case of several space dimensions we have to take into account displacements caused by curvature of the wave pulse front .",
    "in a simplest way it can be done for cylindrical and spherical geometries , and such an additional displacement was calculated long ago by landau @xcite and whitham @xcite ( see also section 102 in @xcite and section 9.1 in @xcite ) .    in cylindrically symmetric case a linear wave at large enough distance from the origin ( i.e. for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the pulse duration )",
    "can be represented by the asymptotic formula @xmath29 after time @xmath30 the pulse propagates due to nonlinear correction to velocity at the additional distance @xmath31 assuming @xmath32 and taking into account that in the additional term we can make a replacement @xmath33 and also replacing @xmath34 by @xmath35 in the coefficient @xmath36 , we modify ( [ eq9 ] ) as follows : @xmath37.\\ ] ] this formula describes evolution of a cylindrically symmetric weakly nonlinear wave .    in a similar way we start from the expression @xmath38 for the solution of a spherically symmetric linear wave equation and",
    "find the additional distance of propagation due to the nonlinear correction to the sound velocity , @xmath39 after replacement with the same accuracy @xmath40 we arrive at the expression @xmath41\\ ] ] describing evolution of a spherically symmetric weakly nonlinear wave .",
    "we can confirm validity of the expressions ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) by the perturbation theory calculations .",
    "as is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in cylindrically or spherically symmetric geometries evolution of waves through weakly nonlinear medium is governed by the equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 for cylindrical case and @xmath44 for spherical case .",
    "making variables replacements @xmath45 in cylindrical case or @xmath46 in spherical case , we transform eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) to the hopf equation @xmath47 with well - known solution @xmath48 that is transformed to ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) after returning to the initial physical variables .",
    "now we can turn to the kz equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we notice that the solutions ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) for small values of transverse coordinates @xmath49 compared with the propagation distance @xmath4 must be the solutions of the kz equation in the first order of the series expansion with respect to a small parameter @xmath50 ( term with @xmath51 should be omitted in the cylindrical case ) .",
    "thus , we arrive at the solution @xmath52\\ ] ] of cylindrical kz equation and @xmath53\\ ] ] of spherical kz equation .",
    "these solutions were found respectively in @xcite and @xcite by different more complicated mathematical methods .    on one hand",
    ", the presented here derivation shows that solutions of multi - dimensional equations that take into account small curvature of wave fronts can be found from corresponding symmetrical solution by their series expansions with respect to small transverse coordinates .",
    "therefore this method can be easily generalized on other forms of nonlinearity and number of transverse dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "substitutions ( [ eq16 ] ) or ( [ eq17 ] ) suggest that similar transformations can be done directly in the kz equation leading to its exact solutions",
    ". we shall develop such a direct method for quite general class of nonlinear acoustic equations in the next section .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we shall consider here the kz equation in non - dimensional form , @xmath54 for generalized nonlinearity @xmath55 and arbitrary number @xmath56 of transverse spatial coordinates @xmath57 , @xmath58 of course , in standard physical application we have @xmath59 or @xmath60 . besides that , we shall confine ourselves to the case of integer positive values of @xmath61 .",
    "solutions ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) as well as substitutions ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) suggest that it might be possible to obtain a wide class of solutions of the equation ( [ eq23 ] ) with the use of the following _ ansatz _ @xmath62 in these new variables the equation ( [ eq22 ] ) takes the form @xmath63_x=0 ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] where subscripts denote derivatives with respect to corresponding variables .",
    "if we assume that @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are some constants , then eq .  ( [ eq25 ] ) transforms to the equation @xmath67 the term with @xmath65 can be excluded by means of the additional replacement @xmath68 where @xmath69 satisfies the equations @xmath70 and evolution of @xmath71 defined in ( [ eq24 ] ) and evolving according to eq .",
    "( [ eq27 ] ) is governed now by the generalized hopf equation @xmath72    the first equation in ( [ eq29 ] ) coincides with the hamilton - jacobi equation for a free particle moving in @xmath56-dimensional space .",
    "its particular solution can be easily found by separation of variables as a sum of `` actions '' corresponding to separate space coordinates .",
    "most interesting for us solution @xcite reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75 , are integration constants",
    ". then substitution of this formula in the left - hand side of the second equation ( [ eq29 ] ) yields @xmath76 taking into account @xmath77 , @xmath78 and introducing @xmath79 , we arrive at the bernoulli equation @xmath80 that can be solved by a standard method to give @xmath81 or @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an integration constant .",
    "if @xmath84 then eq .  ( [ eq34 ] ) simplifies to @xmath85 thus , we have reduced finding @xmath86 to integration of the function in the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) or ( [ eq35b ] ) .",
    "when @xmath86 is found , @xmath87 is determined as @xmath88 .    as a result of the above calculations , the variables in ( [ eq24 ] )",
    "can be considered as known and it remains to find the solution of the generalized hopf equation ( [ eq30 ] ) .",
    "its integration with respect to @xmath89 gives at once @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an arbitrary function to be determined from the initial conditions .",
    "equation ( [ eq36 ] ) can be solved by a standard method of characteristics . along characteristic curve starting at the point @xmath92 at @xmath93 we have @xmath94 and this linear differential equation can be easily solved to give @xmath95 where we denoted @xmath96 the characteristic curve is determined by the equation @xmath97 and its integration yields @xmath98 let the initial distribution @xmath99 at @xmath93 be given by the function @xmath100 , or in implicit form by the function @xmath101 ; then exclusion of @xmath102 and @xmath103 from ( [ eq41 ] ) gives the final result : @xmath104 this equation determines implicitly @xmath105 as a function of @xmath106 through variables @xmath107 in terms of two arbitrary functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 which have to be found from the initial conditions .",
    "first of all , let us check that our general formulas reproduce the known solutions ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) .    in case of a cylindrical kz equation @xmath110 written here in standard non - dimensional notation",
    "we choose @xmath111 , @xmath59 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "then we have @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "consequently @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ kz1 ] ) has a solution @xmath118 or @xmath119 which up to notation coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) .    in a similar way in case of spherical kz equation @xmath120 we choose @xmath111 , @xmath60 , @xmath112 , @xmath121 and obtain @xmath122 , @xmath123 ; consequently @xmath124 , @xmath125 and eq .",
    "( [ kz4 ] ) has a solution @xmath126 or @xmath127 which again up to notation coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) .",
    "now we notice that the constants @xmath128 in ( [ eq31 ] ) and other formulas can have either sign what means that we can consider sound pulses focused in some transverse directions and defocused in the other directions .",
    "exact solutions of the kz equation for such situations , to the best of our knowledge , have not been considered earlier and we shall apply here our approach to a problem of this kind .",
    "thus , we wish to find the solution of the kz equation ( [ kz4 ] ) modeling propagation of a nonlinear sound pulse that is defocused in @xmath9 direction and focused in @xmath129 direction . to this end",
    ", we take in the above formulas @xmath111 , @xmath60 , @xmath84 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , so that @xmath134 and , consequently , @xmath135 where the integration constant is chosen in such a way that @xmath136 .",
    "we assume here that @xmath137 .",
    "the self - similar variable has now the form @xmath138 the variable @xmath139 is expressed in terms of @xmath71 as @xmath140 where @xmath141 obeys the hopf equation @xmath142 we assume that at @xmath143 the distribution of @xmath144 depends on a single self - similar variable @xmath145 then the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq48 ] ) can be written as @xmath146 or , returning to the original variables , @xmath147 this formula determines implicitly @xmath105 as a function of space coordinates at any moment of time @xmath1 in the interval @xmath137 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this restriction makes it impossible to take the limit @xmath121 and to reproduce the solution ( [ kz6 ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to represent this solution in a parametric form . to this end",
    "we notice that the initial @xmath148 given in the form ( [ eq49 ] ) is a function of a single variable @xmath149 the corresponding value @xmath150 is constant along characteristic @xmath151 , that is @xmath152 on this surface in 3d - space for fixed @xmath1 the dependent variable @xmath105 takes the value @xmath153 thus the above solution is parameterized by a parameter @xmath102 on which depend both @xmath105 and the self - similar variable @xmath89 .",
    "exclusion of @xmath154 and @xmath155 from ( [ eq51 ] ) and ( [ eq54 ] ) reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq50 ] ) .",
    "as we see , in the limit @xmath156 the amplitude goes to infinity as @xmath157 due to focusing .",
    "we illustrate this evolution for the case of the initial distribution @xmath158 the profile of the pulse along the @xmath4-axis for @xmath159 , @xmath160 is shown in fig .  1 for several moments of time .",
    "on the contrary to evolution of defocused pulse , now its amplitude increases at the axis and the profile steepens due by virtue of nonlinear effects .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper that exact nonlinear solutions of the kz type equations can be obtained in framework of a simple enough _ ansatz _ leading to partial separation of variables : evolution in transverse direction reduces effectively to free propagation of rays that is governed by simple hamilton - jacobi equation whereas nonlinear effects are described by ordinary differential equation that can be integrated in a closed form .",
    "it is important that our method is effective not only in case of completely integrable situations , when the kz equation represents a dispersionless limit of the kp equation , but also in multi - dimensional geometries and generalized nonlinearities .",
    "this allows one to obtain exact solutions in many realistic situations .    from physical point of view , this method combines nonlinear effects with linear diffraction for wave fronts described by multi - dimensional paraboloid surfaces with arbitrary signs and values of curvature radii . in practically most important 3d case , this yields the exact solutions for focused / defocused pulses with engineered phase fronts .",
    "one may hope that such solutions can find many applications in science and technology .",
