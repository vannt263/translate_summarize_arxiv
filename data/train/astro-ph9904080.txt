    "hickson compact groups ( hereafter hcgs ; hickson 1982 ) are small systems of several galaxies ( four or more ) in an apparent close proximity in the sky .",
    "their dynamical state has been the subject of a controversial debate .",
    "comparison of the observational data with model calculations led mamon ( 1986 , 1987 ) to conclude that less than a half of hcgs could be considered bounded dense systems .",
    "however accumulated statistical evidences ( hickson & rood 1988 ; hickson 1992 ) together with observational evidences , also coming from x - ray observations ( saracco & ciliegi 1995 ; ponman et al . 1996 ; pildis et al . 1995 ) , clearly favor the view that the majority of hcgs are physical systems and not chance projections or transient systems .",
    "one of the expected consequences of the gravitational interactions between galaxies is the enhancement of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the interacting systems ( joseph & wright 1985 ; bushouse 1987 ; laurikainen & moles 1989 ) . the photometric and spectroscopic studies carried out so far ( rubin et al .",
    "1991 & mendes de oliveira et al . 1997 ; moles et al .",
    "1994 & mendes de oliveira et al . 1994",
    "; vilchez & iglesias paramo 1998 ; plana et al .",
    "1998 , iglesias paramo & vilchez 1999 ) , aiming at establishing the fraction of interacting galaxies in hcgs , have often given contradictory results .",
    "actually a possibility exists that only a fraction of the hcgs are bound systems and that bound hcgs evolve in different ways .",
    "different evolutions could be due to both the different dynamical properties of hcgs and to their different birthplace , i.e. the environment in which they are embedded .",
    "powerful signs of star formation activity are the ionization lines emitted by the heated gas surrounding the regions of star formation . unlike the color indexes in the @xmath1 filters , that give indications about the past star formation ( @xmath2 years ) , the h@xmath3 emission line at 6563  can be used as a quantitative and spatial tracer of the rate of massive ( @xmath4 10 m@xmath5 ) and therefore recent ( @xmath6 years ) star formation ( kennicutt 1983 ; ryder & dopita 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , knowing the h@xmath3 emission of the hcg galaxies , it is possible in principle to carry out important knowledges about the present merger and interaction events in these systems .",
    "up to now the only h@xmath3 images regarding hcg galaxies have been collected by rubin et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and more recently by vilchez & iglesias paramo ( 1998 ) .",
    "they carried out h@xmath3 emission - line images respectively for 14 and 16 hcgs .",
    "while vilchez & iglesias paramo estimate the h@xmath3 flux for each of the 63 galaxies of their sample ( iglesias paramo & vilchez 1999 ) , rubin et al .",
    "do not use flux calibrated and they take into account a sample constituted by disk galaxies only .",
    "we have recently obtained @xmath0 fluxes and luminosities for a sample of 95 galaxies from calibrated observations of 31 hcgs ( severgnini et al .",
    "1999 ) . here",
    "we present the preliminary results of the analysis performed on a subsample of 66 galaxies .",
    "observations have been carried out at the 2.1 meter telescope ( design ritchey - chretien ) at the national observatory of mexico in s. pedro martir during three different observing runs ( november 1995 , april 1996 and february 1997 ) .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a tektronix ccd of 1024x1024 pixels , each 24@xmath7 m x 24@xmath7 m . the telescope scale ( 13 arcsec / mm ) and the pixel dimensions provide a pixel size of 0.3 arcsec / pix with a resulting field of view of 5.12@xmath85.12@xmath9 . during these three runs",
    "we observed 31 hcgs in h@xmath3 filters .",
    "the remaining 61 hcgs were not in ours sample because the adequate h@xmath3 interferometric filters were not available .",
    "this is the only criterion used to select the observed groups .",
    "+ in order to calibrate our data , we have observed some spectrophotometric stars , equally spaced in time during each night , taken from the list of massey @xmath10 strobel ( 1988 ) . the standards were observed in all the h@xmath3 narrow - band filters used to observe hcgs .    during the observations the seeing was in the range of 2 to 2.6 arcsec and the photometry was within 0.05 mag in all but one ( worse ) night .",
    "the mean limiting flux of the observations , at one sigma from the background and within the mean seeing disk ( 2.3 arcsec ) , is 9.22@xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 .",
    "we estimated the @xmath0 flux and luminosity for 66 galaxies , 12 out of which are upper limits .",
    "we adopt h@xmath14=100 km/(s mpc ) and q@xmath14=0.5 .",
    "+ in figure 1 the distribution of @xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath15 ) of the 54 detected galaxies is shown .",
    "@xmath15 for each galaxy has been derived from using a @xmath16 isophotal flux computed within the region defined by a detection threshold of one sigma above the background .",
    "a detailed description of the data reduction , the photometric calibration , the flux estimate and the luminosity derivation is given in severgnini et al .",
    "we have investigated about the dependency of the h@xmath3 luminosity of galaxies on the dynamical properties of hcgs and on the environment in which groups are embedded .",
    "the statistical analysis we have performed has made use of the survival analysis ( isobe , feigelson & nelson 1986 ) since some of the observed galaxies have not been detected in our observations .    in an undisrupted galaxy",
    "it is expected that actual sfr ( @xmath1710@xmath18 years ) is correlated to the quantity of young stellar population ( o , b stars ) . to test if this correlation is present also for hcg galaxies we searched for a correlation between the @xmath0 luminosity of galaxies and their @xmath19 absolute magnitude ( m@xmath20 ( _ `` atlas of compact groups of galaxies '' _ , hickson 1993 ) ) , good tracer of young stars .",
    "we found a significant correlation between these two quantities in the sense that :    @xmath21 galaxy having higher ( lower ) @xmath0 luminosity have higher ( lower ) @xmath19 luminosity .",
    "we have then searched for correlations between the dynamical parameters of hcgs ( velocity dispersion , mass density , surface brightness and crossing time , as from hickson et al .",
    "1992 ) and the @xmath0 luminosity of the member galaxies .",
    "our analysis shows the presence of correlations between each of these parameters and the @xmath0 luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "in particular we found that the @xmath0 emission is correlated to crossing time and it is anti - correlated to velocity dispersion , mass density and surface brightness in the sense that :    @xmath21 hcgs having higher ( lower ) densities have higher ( lower ) velocity dispersions and the galaxies inside them have lower ( higher ) @xmath0 luminosities .    in figure 2 the relation between @xmath0 luminosity of galaxies and the velocity dispersion of the groups",
    "is shown ( the probability of the two not being correlated is 0.001 ) .",
    "such correlations would seem to point toward a dependence of the @xmath0 luminosity of galaxies , and hence of their sfr , on the dynamical properties of hcgs .    to test if different environments , where hcgs are actually found ,",
    "affect the h@xmath3 of galaxies inside them we have divided our sample in two subsamples , following the rood and struble s ( 1994 ) classification : the first composed by the isolate compact groups ( hcg@xmath22 ) and the second one consisting of those compact groups embedded in loose groups ( hcg@xmath23 ) . through a statistical comparison we found that there are nt significant differences between @xmath0 luminosity distributions of galaxies inside hcg@xmath22 and hcg@xmath23 .",
    "the same result is found if we compare the dynamical parameters of isolate hcgs to those of hcgs in loose groups .",
    "nevertheless , from our data we found that the velocity dispersion ( figure 3 ) and crossing time of hcg@xmath23 are correlated to the @xmath0 luminosity of their galaxies and that these correlations are absent for hcg@xmath22 .",
    "we thus can assert that inside hcg@xmath23 there are correlations between two dynamical parameters and @xmath0 emission that are not present inside hcg@xmath22 .",
    "these results suggest that , although the surrounding environment of hcgs does not directly influence the sfr of galaxies and the dynamical properties of groups , it modifies the relation between dynamical properties of groups and sfr of their galaxies .",
    "+ moreover we have tested that the correlation found between @xmath0 and @xmath19 luminosity is present only for galaxies inside hcg@xmath23 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this result suggests that the different hcg environments affect also the ratio between the population of young stars and actual star formation of galaxies .",
    "+ thus we assert that the surrounding environment of hcgs affects the evolution of the hcg galaxies .",
    "finally , we also investigated if the morphology of galaxies is influenced by different environments and if a particular hcg surrounding environment can favor the formation and evolution of a particular morphology .",
    "we divide all the galaxies of hickson s sample in ellipticals @xmath24 lenticulars ( e / s0 ) and spirals @xmath24 irregulars ( s / i ) finding the same fraction of e / so and s / i inside hcg@xmath22 and hcg@xmath23 respectively . thus we conclude that the environment in which hcgs are embedded does not influence the morphology of their member galaxies .",
    "we have studied h@xmath3 calibrated fluxes for a sample of 66 galaxies in 31 hcgs .",
    "12 galaxies of our sample have not been detected in our images and this implies that they have a h@xmath3 emission lower than @xmath259.22@xmath26 erg s@xmath13 @xmath12 , being @xmath27 the 1@xmath28 limiting flux integrated within one seeing disk reached in our observations .    from the analysis presented above",
    ", we could conclude that the @xmath0 luminosity of galaxies is affected by the dynamical properties of compact groups .",
    "the correlations found would point towards a merger scenario in which @xmath0 brightest galaxies are inside groups with higher probability of interaction i.e. lower values of velocity dispersion and mass density .",
    "it is worth noting however that @xmath0 luminosity could be matched by mass of galaxies , that is the sfr could be higher ( lower ) because of the higher ( lower ) quantity of the available gas and not because of a real higher _ efficiency _ or _",
    "fraction_. in principle such degeneracy could be avoided normalizing the @xmath0 luminosity by a mass tracer of galaxies which is very well represented by the luminosity in the near ir band ( h or k band ) , as shown by gavazzi et al .",
    "nevertheless some authors ( e.g. iglesias paramo et al . 1999 ) make use of the absolute b magnitude under the implicit assumption that @xmath29 . on the other hand , since a correlation between @xmath0 and b luminosities is expected under robust assumptions ( and we found it ) the use of @xmath30 to remove the degeneracy could lead to misleading results .",
    "thus , even if we find correlations between @xmath0 luminosity and dynamical parameters of the groups , further investigations are required in order to establish if the dynamics of hcgs affects the evolution of their member galaxies .",
    "moreover the relations we find seem to depend on the environment in which hcgs are embedded , as confirmed by the correlations found only in the case of hcg@xmath31 sample .",
    "since the @xmath0 luminosity is a good star formation tracer , this result suggests that also the environments surrounding hcgs could influence the evolution of galaxies into hcgs .",
    "the sfr for objects can be directly inferred by h@xmath3 luminosity using the result of kennicut ( 1983 ) , which relates the sfr to @xmath0 luminosity through the relation @xmath32 where a salpeter initial mass function with an upper mass cutoff of 100 @xmath33 have been assumed . from the luminosities",
    "we infer a star formation rate for our detected galaxies in the range 0.01 - 2.88 @xmath33 yr@xmath13 in absence of internal extinction .",
