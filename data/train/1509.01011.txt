    "the study of the limit distribution of galois orbits of points of small height was initiated by szpiro , ullmo and zhang in their seminal paper @xcite .",
    "they proved the equidistribution of the galois orbits of sequences of points in an abelian variety over a number field , with nron - tate height converging to zero , over the archimedean places .",
    "it was motivated by the bogomolov conjecture on abelian varieties , and eventually applied in the affirmative answer to this conjecture by ullmo @xcite and zhang @xcite , see also  @xcite for similar results in the function field case .",
    "this equidistribution result was widely generalized , in particular to other varieties and other height functions and , with the introduction of berkovich spaces , to the equidistribution over non - archimedean places .",
    "we next introduce the necessary background to explain this generalization .",
    "let @xmath1 be a global field , that is , a field which is either a number field or the function field of a regular projective curve over an arbitrary field , and @xmath2 its set of places . let @xmath3 be a proper algebraic variety over @xmath1 of dimension @xmath4 , and @xmath5 a semipositive metrized ( cartier ) divisor with @xmath6 big .",
    "let @xmath7 be the associated height function on the set of algebraic points of @xmath3 , see  [ sec : preliminaries ] for details .",
    "it is a generalization of the notion of height of algebraic points considered by weil , northcott and others .",
    "the _ essential minimum _ of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath9 , is the smallest possible limit value of the height of a generic net of algebraic points of @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , we say that a net @xmath10 is _ @xmath8-small _",
    "if @xmath11    a fundamental inequality by zhang @xcite shows that the essential minimum can be bounded below in terms of the height and the degree of @xmath8 : @xmath12 we say that @xmath8 is _ quasi - canonical _ if this lower bound for the essential minimum is an equality ( definition  [ def:1 ] )",
    ". examples of quasi - canonical metrized divisors are given by the canonical metrics on divisors of toric and abelian varieties and , more generally , by the metrics coming from algebraic dynamical systems .",
    "for a place @xmath13 , we denote by @xmath14 the @xmath0-adic analytification of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath0 is archimedean , it is a complex space whereas , if @xmath0 is non - archimedean , it is a berkovich space over @xmath15 , the completion of the algebraic closure of the local field  @xmath16 .",
    "we endow the space of probability measures on @xmath14 with the weak-@xmath17 topology with respect to the space of continuous functions on  @xmath14 .    for an algebraic point @xmath18 of @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath19 its @xmath0-adic galois orbit , that is , the orbit of @xmath18 in @xmath20 under the action of the absolute galois group of @xmath1 .",
    "we set @xmath21 for the uniform probability measure on @xmath19 .",

    "let @xmath10 be a generic @xmath8-small net of algebraic points of @xmath3 .",
    "then , for every @xmath24 , the net of probability measures @xmath25 converges to @xmath26 , the normalized @xmath0-adic monge - ampre measure of @xmath8 .",
    "a common feature of this result and its variants and generalizations , is the assumption that the lower bound is an equality or , in other words , that the metrized divisor @xmath8 is quasi - canonical .",
    "this severely restricts their range of application .",
    "nonetheless , these results do apply to the important case of metrics arising from algebraic dynamical systems and moreover , they have a very strong thesis : not only the galois orbits of points of small height do converge , but the limit measure is given by the normalized @xmath0-adic monge - ampre measure .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to start the study what happens when we remove the hypothesis that @xmath8 is quasi - canonical .",
    "some of our typical questions are : is there always an equidistribution phenomenon for galois orbits of @xmath8-small points ? if not , can we give conditions on @xmath8 , beyond being quasi - canonical , under which such a phenomenon occurs ? when equidistribution occurs , can we describe the limit measure ?",
    "we address these questions and some of its continuations in the toric setting .",
    "our approach is based on the techniques developed in the series @xcite .",
    "these techniques are well - suited for the study of toric metrics and their associated height functions . in the sequel , we recall the basic constructions .",
    "let @xmath3 be a proper toric variety over @xmath1 of dimension @xmath4 , given by a complete fan  @xmath27 on a vector space @xmath28 , and a big toric divisor @xmath6 on @xmath3 , given by a virtual support function @xmath29 .",
    "this toric divisor also defines an @xmath4-dimensional polytope  @xmath30 in the dual space @xmath31 .",

    "they verify that @xmath37 is the zero function for all @xmath0 except for a finite number .",
    "the _ global roof function _ is a concave function @xmath38 defined as a weighted sum of the local roof functions .",
    "the metric functions and the roof functions convey lot of information of the pair @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , the essential minimum of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath8 can be computed as the maximum of the global roof function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.1 ) : @xmath40    in the toric setting , the condition that the metrized divisor @xmath8 is quasi - canonical is very restrictive , since it is equivalent to the condition that its global roof function is constant ( proposition [ prop:10 ] ) .",
    "thus , the only toric metrics to which the equidistribution theorem  [ thm:9 ] applies are those whose global roof function is constant .    to identify the toric metrics having good equidistribution properties , we introduce the notion of _ monocritical _ toric metrized divisor .",
    "the semipositive toric metrized divisor @xmath8 is monocritical if a certain function on a space of measures attains its infimum at a unique measure ( definition [ def:16 ] ) .",

    "critical point _ of @xmath8 .",
    "the condition for @xmath8 of being monocritical can be characterized in terms of its global roof function : given a point @xmath43 maximizing @xmath44 , the sup - differential @xmath45 is a convex subset of @xmath34 containing the point @xmath46",
    ". then @xmath8 is monocritical if and only if @xmath46 is a vertex of this convex subset and , when this is the case , the critical point of @xmath47 can be computed from the sup - differential of the local roof functions at  @xmath48 ( proposition  [ prop:14 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath49 be the torus of @xmath3 , which can be identified with @xmath50 , the principal open subset of @xmath3 .",

    "when @xmath0 is archimedean , it is the uniform measure on a translate of @xmath57 whereas , when @xmath0 is non - archimedean , it is the dirac measure at a translate of the gauss point of @xmath53 .    the following is the main result of this paper ( theorem  [ thm:5 ] ) .",

    "when this is the case , the limit measure agrees with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the @xmath0-adic component of the critical point of @xmath8 .",
    "quasi - canonical toric metrized divisors are monocritical , and theorem  [ thm:10 ] reduces to theorem  [ thm:9 ] in this case .",
    "our result produces a wealth of new examples of metric satisfying the equidistribution property , that were not covered by the previous results .",
    "in particular , this is the case for toric divisors over a number field  @xmath1 with positive smooth metrics at the archimedean places and canonical metrics at the non - archimedean ones ( theorem [ thm:8 ] ) .",

    ".    in the other extreme , classical examples of translates of subtori with the canonical metric can behave badly with respect to equidistribution .",

    "as we already mentioned , the original motivation in @xcite to search for equidistribution results of galois orbits of small points was to prove the bogomolov conjecture .",
    "the bogomolov conjecture for toric varieties can be stated as follows : let  @xmath3 be a toric variety over @xmath1 and @xmath98 an ample toric divisor on @xmath3 equipped with the canonical metric .",

    "this conjecture was proved by zhang @xcite for number fields , and later bilu gave a proof using his equidistribution theorem  @xcite .",
    "here we extend this result to an arbitrary monocritical metric on a toric variety over a number field ( theorem  [ thm:2 ] ) .",

    "_ if every @xmath8-special subvariety is a translate of a subtorus ( definition  [ def:15 ] ) .",
    "this property is intimately related with the equidistribution property .",
    "indeed , we give an example of a metrized divisor @xmath8 on @xmath75 , such that the line of equation @xmath110 is @xmath8-special ( example  [ exm:10 ] ) .",
    "this line is certainly not a translate of a subtorus , and so @xmath8 does not satisfy the bogomolov property .",
    "this metrized divisor is a variant of the one in example [ exm:5 ] , and does not verify modulus concentration nor equidistribution for any place of @xmath63 .",
    "we comment briefly on the techniques of proof . to prove theorem  [ thm:11 ] , for each place",
    "@xmath0 we construct an upper - semicontinuous concave functional @xmath111 on the space of probability measures with finite first moment on @xmath34 . using the toric dictionary from @xcite ,",
    "we reduce the study of the modulus distribution of @xmath0-adic galois orbits to the optimization of this functional , which we treat by applying prokorov s compactness theorem .    once we know that a monocritical divisor @xmath8 satisfies modulus concentration at every place",
    ", we can construct another toric metric on  @xmath6 that is quasi - canonical and such that the @xmath8-small points are also small with respect to this new metric . with this trick ,",
    "the toric equidistribution theorem  [ thm:10 ] is derived from theorem  [ thm:9 ] .    the bogomolov property for monocritical metrics ( theorem  [ thm:12 ] ) follows from theorem [ thm:7 ] , a variant of the toric equidistribution theorem for @xmath47-small nets that are not necessarily generic but only _ strict _ , in the sense that they eventually avoid any fixed translate of subtorus .",
    "these results arise several interesting questions .",
    "for instance : is it possible that a given semipositive toric metrized divisor @xmath8 satisfies the equidistribution property at one place and not at another ?",
    "we study this for the projective line showing that , under a natural rationality hypothesis , the equidistribution property holds at a given place if and only if it holds at every place ( proposition [ prop:8 ] ) .",
    "however , this conclusion is not true without this rationality hypothesis ( remark  [ rem:3 ] ) and we have neither settled this question for the projective line in full generality , nor treated toric varieties of higher dimension",
    ".    it would also be interesting to see if the converse of theorem [ thm:12 ] holds : let @xmath3 be proper toric variety with @xmath112 . given a semipositive toric metrized divisor @xmath47 on x , with @xmath6 big satisfying the bogomolov property , is @xmath8 necessarily monocritical ? in proposition  [ prop:2 ] we show that this is true in a very particular case . extending this to the general case would reinforce the link between the equidistribution and the bogomolov properties .",
    "the results of this paper also inspire questions for general varieties and metrized divisors .",
    "for instance , from corollary  [ cor:1 ] , it is plausible to conjecture that a toric divisor equipped with a positive smooth , but not necessarily toric , archimedean metric and canonical non - archimedean metrics , does satisfy the equidistribution property .",
    "a puzzling question is that of computing the essential minimum , with a formula generalizing to the general , non - toric , case . even more challenging seems the problem of generalizing the crucial notion of monocritical metrized divisor .",
    "several of the results presented in this introduction hold in greater generality and their thesis are stronger .",
    "we refer to the body of the paper for these versions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : preliminaries ] we give the preliminaries on galois orbits and height of points . in  [ sec : auxil - results - conv ] we introduce the upper semi - continuous concave functional @xmath111 and study its properties . in  [ sec : modul - distr - toric ] we study the modulus distribution of @xmath0-adic galois orbits of @xmath47-small nets of points in toric varieties . in ",

    "<S> furthermore , when this is the case , the limit measure is a translate of the natural measure on the compact torus sitting in the principal orbit of the ambient toric variety .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study the @xmath0-adic modulus distribution of galois orbits of small points . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize , in terms of the given toric semipositive metrized divisor , the cluster measures of @xmath0-adic valuations of galois orbits of generic small sequences .    </S>",
    "<S> the bogomolov property now says that a subvariety of the principal orbit of a proper toric variety that has the same essential minimum than the toric variety with respect to a monocritical toric metrized divisor , must be a translate of a subtorus . </S>",
    "<S> we also give several examples , including a non - monocritical divisor for which the bogomolov property does not hold . </S>"
