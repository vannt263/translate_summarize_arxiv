    "over the past few decades , it has become clear that a large fraction of stars with significant carbon enhancements exists among the populations of metal - poor stars in the galactic halo .",
    "these carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars were originally defined as having metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath3 and carbon - abundance ratios [ c / fe ] @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "recent studies of large numbers of metal - poor stars suggest that a more natural dividing line between the carbon - normal and carbon - enhanced populations is [ c / fe ] @xmath5 ( see , for example , figure 4 from aoki et al .",
    "2007 and figure 4 from carollo et al .",
    "we therefore define cemp stars as having [ fe / h ] @xmath3 and [ c / fe ] @xmath5 .",
    "the frequency of cemp stars , among metal - poor stars in the milky way , increases with decreasing metallicity @xcite , as well as with distance from the galactic plane @xcite . from the study of their elemental abundance patterns",
    ", one can begin to uncover details concerning the nature of their progenitor objects .",
    "there exist a number of different sub - classes of cemp stars with specific abundance characteristics ; these different sub - classes are suggestive of different sites of carbon production at early times @xcite .",
    "cemp-@xmath6 stars , which exhibit evidence of @xmath6-process - element enhancement , are the most common ; around 80% of cemp stars exhibit @xmath6-process - element enhancements @xcite , including both the cemp-@xmath6 and cemp-@xmath7 sub - classes ( the latter sub - class indicates stars for which the presence of both @xmath8- and @xmath6-process element enhancements are found ) .",
    "it is widely believed that these objects are the result of mass transfer from a companion asymptotic giant - branch ( agb ) star , where the production of carbon and @xmath6-process elements occurs @xcite .",
    "about half of the cemp-@xmath6 stars have been shown to be cemp-@xmath7 , suggesting formation from molecular clouds that had already been enhanced in @xmath8-process elements , opening the possibility that their carbon enhancements arose from more than one site . in any case",
    ", observational evidence suggests that the cemp-@xmath7 stars ( and other @xmath8-process - element rich stars ) do not require a contribution of @xmath8-process elements from a binary companion ( see hansen et al . 2011b , 2013 ) .",
    "stars in the cemp - no sub - class exhibit no neutron - capture element enhancements , and the source of the carbon enhancement for these stars is less certain .",
    "current suggestions include the possibility that very massive , rapidly - rotating , mega metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 ) stars were very efficient producers of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , due to distinctive internal burning and mixing episodes followed by strong mass loss ( hirschi et al .",
    "2006 ; meynet et al .",
    "2006 , 2010 ) .",
    "another suggested origin is pollution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by so - called faint supernovae associated with the first generations of stars , which can experience extensive mixing and fallback during their explosions @xcite .",
    "recent observations of some of the lowest - metallicity rr lyrae stars have revealed similarities between the abundance patterns of these stars and their non - varying counterparts in the halo of the milky way .",
    "for example , hansen et al . ( 2011a ) find that the elemental abundance patterns of two very metal - poor rr lyrae stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 ) match typical patterns of very metal - poor stars observed in the galactic halo , and indeed , they can be compared to theoretical yields from the first generations of stars .",
    "because a large fraction of the very metal - poor ( vmp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath11 ) stars studied in the galactic halo are cemp stars , one would expect that a similar fraction of vmp horizontal - branch stars would exhibit carbon over - abundances .",
    "prior to our observational program , only two cemp rr lyrae stars had been recognized @xcite .",
    "now , the sample size has increased by more than a factor of four , as we have identified seven new cemp rr lyrae stars .",
    "one clear advantage of the study of cemp rr lyrae stars , as opposed to cemp stars in other evolutionary stages , is that the observed surface abundances are primarily influenced by the dilution of accreted material in the receiving star at first dredge up .",
    "when the receiving star is on the main sequence , it is unknown whether the observed surface composition is purely due to the makeup of the accreted material , or whether some non - convective process ( such as rotation , e.g. , masseron et al .",
    "2012 , or thermohaline mixing , e.g. , stancliffe et al .",
    "2007 ) has already led to dilution . by using more evolved objects",
    "we bypass this uncertainty .",
    "detailed stellar models @xcite suggest that the surface composition of a cemp star in the rr lyrae phase is predominantly determined by the mass of material accreted , and the composition of the ejecta .",
    "this assumes that all evolved objects had a mass of around 0.8 m@xmath2 at the main sequence turn - off , and consequently , their structures along the giant branch ( particularly the depth that the convective envelope reaches during first dredge - up ) are similar .",
    "the cemp rr lyrae stars may thus provide a constraint on the efficiency of wind accretion , which , although currently highly uncertain ( abate et al .",
    "2013 ) , potentially has an important impact on , e.g. , type ia supernova progenitors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the target selection , observing techniques , and details of the observations .",
    "sections 3 and 4 describe the estimation of stellar parameters and carbon abundances .",
    "a discussion of the oosterhoff classifications of our program stars , and their implications , is given in section 5 .",
    "section 6 includes a description of the theoretical models used for comparison , and section 7 contains a thorough discussion of the analysis of our measured [ c / fe ] abundances in terms of these theoretical scenarios .",
    "our conclusions and plans for future work are provided in section 8 .",
    "the rr lyrae stars observed for this pilot program , listed in @xcite , were selected from the hamburg / eso objective - prism survey , cross - matched with previously recognized rr lyraes .",
    "the benefit of drawing cemp candidates from the he s is that ( rather crude ) preliminary estimates of [ fe / h ] and [ c / fe ] from their low - resolution spectra are available @xcite .",
    "higher - resolution spectroscopic observations remain necessary to confirm these values , as the errors on these low - resolution estimates are quite large .",
    "furthermore , observations of these rr lyraes during the he s is at random phase , whereas in order to obtain accurate estimates of their atmospheric parameters ( and elemental abundances ) it is crucial to obtain their spectra during times of low activity .",

    "[ cfe ] , it is evident that none of these five stars are consistent with the lowest - mass agb donor , 1 m@xmath2 , even when the highest accreted mass is considered . for lower accretion masses , the predicted values of [ c / fe ]",
    "are sub - solar and not shown in the figure .",
    "in fact , for all agb donor masses considered , the lowest accretion masses ( 0.001 m@xmath2 ) are inconsistent with this sample , as the resultant [ c / fe ] abundances are all sub - solar .",
    "furthermore , these observed abundances are inconsistent with large accretion masses , 0.1 m@xmath2 , regardless of the agb donor mass .",
    "for these five stars , we therefore can reasonably constrain the agb donor mass as being @xmath44 m@xmath2 and the accreted mass as being @xmath45 m@xmath2 . indeed , these five cemp rr lyrae stars are consistent with agb donors in the range @xmath46 m@xmath2 and appear to have accreted a few hundredths of a solar mass of agb material prior to their subsequent evolution .    _",
    "wy vir  _ the lowest - metallicity star in the sample , wy vir , has a carbon - abundance ratio that exactly matches two of the theoretical scenarios , both 0.02 m@xmath2 of material accreted from a 1.5 m@xmath2 donor and 0.01 m@xmath2 of material accreted from a 2.0 m@xmath2 donor , as shown in figure [ cfe ] . as such , it appears to be indicative of the same type of progenitor system described for the five stars above .",
    "however , given the large uncertainty associated with the measured [ c / fe ] ( 0.3 dex ) , there remains a possibility that @xmath47 solar masses of material could have been accreted from a low - mass agb companion of @xmath48 solar mass .",
    "while this ambiguity exists , it is nevertheless evident that such large accretion masses can not have come from the larger - mass donors considered . and , as for the rest of the sample",
    ", we can rule out all scenarios of very low accretion masses of 0.001 m@xmath2 .",
    "_ iv leo  _ the highest - metallicity star in the sample , iv leo , presents the only opportunity to explore the different evolutionary mixing mechanisms explored in these models .",
    "similar to all of the stars described above , its measured [ c / fe ] agrees with models of accretion of a few hundredths of a solar mass from a 1.5 or 2 solar mass agb donor .",
    "interestingly , another possible progenitor scenario includes the accretion of a large amount of mass ( @xmath490.1 m@xmath2 ) from the 1.5 or 2 solar mass donor , but _ only _ if one considers that thermohaline mixing , or thermohaline mixing and gravitational settling , was / were active during a previous evolutionary phase . without these extra mixing processes ,",
    "such a large accretion mass would result in a much larger [ c / fe ] than we measure in this star .",
    "it is possible , therefore , to consider that a very large amount of mass was accreted under these certain mixing physics constraints .",
    "we confidently rule out any scenario with an agb companion of 1 solar mass , as well as all cases of 0.001 solar mass accretion .    _",
    "j1245@xmath130419  _ the only star in this sample which does not formally meet the criteria for cemp stars , j1245@xmath130419 , has the most ambiguous carbon - abundance ratio when it comes to theoretical comparison , as can be seen in figure [ cfe ] .",
    "the value of [ c / fe ] for this star is fully consistent with a wide range of scenarios , including all three donor masses .",
    "if the agb companion was only 1 m@xmath2 , then accretion must have been very high . for the 1.5 and 2 m@xmath2 cases , accretion mass would have to be around 0.01 or 0.02 solar masses .",
    "regardless of this ambiguity , we can with certainty rule out a large accretion mass from a 1.5 or 2 solar mass donor .",
    "we have obtained moderate - resolution spectroscopy and estimated stellar parameters and carbon - abundance ratios , [ c / fe ] , for a sample of 8 rr lyrae stars , resulting in the identification of seven new cemp rr lyrae variables .",
    "as there were previously only two such stars discovered , we significantly increase the sample size of these objects .",
    "five of the stars are oosterhoff ii type variables and the remaining three are oosterhoff i , based on their periods , @xmath12 amplitudes , and metallicities . upon comparison to a sample of metal - poor rr lyrae stars with sub - solar [ c / fe ]",
    ", we find a separation between pulsation period , suggesting that the presence ( or lack ) of sufficient carbon could have a physical effect on the dynamics of variability .",
    "however , larger sample sizes of both carbon - enhanced and carbon - weak rr lyrae stars remain necessary to fully explore this claim .",
    "we compared the measured [ c / fe ] abundances in the cemp rr lyrae stars to new theoretical models of agb binary mass transfer and subsequent evolution .",
    "we find that the majority of the are consistent with agb donor masses of @xmath50 m@xmath2 and accretion masses of @xmath51 m@xmath2 .",
    "large accretion masses , on the order of 0.1 m@xmath2 remain possible for a few objects .",
    "all eight stars are inconsistent with scenarios in which very low accretion masses of @xmath52 m@xmath2 are considered , which is to be expected , given the small contribution of carbon these donors provide and the large degree of dilution that this material undergoes .",
    "future studies should include high - resolution spectroscopy of cemp rr lyrae stars , as well as other non - variable horizontal - branch stars , in order to explore more elements for theoretical comparison , in particular those associated with the @xmath6-process .",
    "with a larger set of high - precision abundance estimates , we can delve more deeply into the likely mixing history of these stars ( by both convective and non - convective processes ) .",
    "furthermore , we plan to expand the set of theoretical models to include those of different metallicities for a more complete set of donor masses and accretion masses .",
