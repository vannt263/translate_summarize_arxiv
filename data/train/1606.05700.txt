    "the berry - esseen theorem ( berry  @xcite and esseen  @xcite ) states that if @xmath0 , @xmath7 are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables with mean 0 and variance 1 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes `` is distributed as '' , then @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the komogorov distance : for two random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 with distributions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 the kolmogorov distance @xmath18 measures the difference between the distribution functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but it does not tell much about the difference between the probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 for a non - interval borel set @xmath21 , e.g. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the set of all integers . such difference is reflected in the total variation distance @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the borel @xmath27-algebra on @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the definition is equivalent to @xmath30 where the supremum is taken over all measurable functions @xmath31 on @xmath32 bounded by 1 .",
    "although central limit theorems in the total variation have been studied in some special circumstances ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is generally believed that the total variation distance is too strong for normal approximation ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , chen and leong  @xcite , fang  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the total variation distance between any binomial distribution and any normal distribution is always 1 . to recover central limit theorems in the total variation ,",
    "a common approach is to discretize the distribution of interest and approximate it with a simple discrete distribution , e.g. , translated poisson ( rllin  @xcite ) , centered binomial ( rllin  @xcite ) , discretized normal ( chen and leong  @xcite , fang  @xcite ) and a family of polynomial type distributions ( goldstein and xia  @xcite ) .",
    "the multivariate versions of these approximations are investigated by barbour , luczak and xia  @xcite .    by discretizing a distribution @xmath33 of interest",
    ", we essentially group the probability of an area and put it at one point in the area , hence the information of @xmath34 for a general set @xmath35 is completely lost . in this note , we consider the normal approximation in the total variation to the sum of iid random variables with finite second moment .",
    "the lebesgue decomposition theorem @xcite ensures that any distribution function @xmath33 on @xmath28 can be represented as @xmath36 where @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two distribution functions such that , with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath28 , @xmath39 is absolutely continuous and @xmath38 is singular .",
    "a distribution function @xmath33 on @xmath28 is said to be non - singular if @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , @xmath33 is non - singular if and only if there exists a sub - probability measure @xmath41 with a density @xmath42 such that @xmath43    [ thm1 ] let @xmath0 , @xmath44 be iid with finite second moment , define @xmath3 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "the following are equivalent :    \\(i ) there exists a finite integer @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "\\(ii ) there exists a finite integer @xmath47 such that @xmath49 is non - singular .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath51 has finite third moment , then ( i)-(iii ) are also equivalent to    \\(iv ) @xmath6 .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] says that , for the iid sequence @xmath52 with finite third moment , we have the dichotomy that either @xmath53 is singular so that @xmath4 for all @xmath5 or it can be approximated by the normal distribution with the same mean and variance in the total variation with convergence speed no less than @xmath54 .",
    "curiously , this phenomenon may be related to the kolmogorov s zero - one law .",
    "it is possible to generalize some parts of theorem  [ thm1 ] to non - identically distributed random variables but the formulation of such generalizations is typically complicated . by focusing on the most important case , we aim to keep the paper reader - friendly and to deliver a clear and concise message .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] is based on stein s method for normal approximation and the estimate of @xmath55 .",
    "generally speaking , the easiest metric that stein s method for normal approximation can handle is the wasserstein metric .",
    "much more effort is needed to achieve an error bound for the kolmogorov distance enjoying the same order as that for the wasserstein distance bound @xcite . the way that stein s method for normal approximation",
    "is used in this paper seems to be unexplored . in the context of poisson and other discrete distribution approximations ,",
    "this approach is well studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we start with a few technical lemmas .      _ proof . _ for convenience , we write @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 as the distribution , density and characteristic functions of @xmath65 respectively .",
    "it is well - known that the triangular density @xmath66 has the characteristic function @xmath67 , which gives @xmath68 . using the fact that the convolution of two symmetric unimodal distributions on @xmath28 is unimodal @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that the distribution of @xmath65 is unimodal and symmetric .",
    "this ensures that @xmath69 applying the inversion formula , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 and the second equality is due to the fact that @xmath72 is an odd function .",
    "obviously , @xmath73 so we need to establish an upper bound for @xmath74 .",
    "a direct verification gives @xmath75 which implies @xmath76 now , combining with gives .",
