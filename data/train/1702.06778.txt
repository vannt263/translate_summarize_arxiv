    "according to the principle of conformal invariance @xcite , two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems of constituents with _ short - range _ interactions , confined to a large domain with a smooth boundary , exhibit at the critical point universal finite - size properties .",
    "in particular , for a disk domain of radius @xmath8 , @xmath9 with the euler number @xmath10 , the ( dimensionless ) free energy has the large-@xmath8 expansion @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inverse temperature and @xmath13 is a length scale .",
    "the bulk specific free energy @xmath14 and the surface tension @xmath15 are non - universal , i.e. , dependent on microscopic details of the given model and on the temperature .",

    "the massless gaussian theory with a field @xmath17 , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath18 has @xmath19 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study 2d classical ( i.e. , non - quantum ) systems of charged pointlike particles interacting pairwisely by the _ long - range _ coulomb potential @xmath20 , where the dielectric constants of the medium in which particles move and of the walls are equal to @xmath21 ( vacuum in gauss units ) , for simplicity .",
    "the logarithmic potential is the solution of the 2d poisson equation @xmath22 and in three dimensions corresponds to the effective interaction of infinitely long parallel charged lines , perpendicular to the plane .",
    "two types of coulomb systems are of special interest .",
    "the one - component plasma ( ocp ) , or jellium , is a system of identical mobile ( say elementary ) charges @xmath6 immersed in a homogeneous neutralizing background charge density .",
    "the symmetric two - component plasma ( tcp ) , or the coulomb gas , is a system of oppositely charged @xmath2 mobile particles with no background .",
    "while the ocp is usually studied in the canonical ensemble , the tcp is treated within the grand - canonical ensemble , with the enforced neutrality condition for each microscopic configuration . in both cases ,",
    "the thermodynamics and the particle correlation functions are determined by the only dimensionless parameter , the coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "the 2d ocp is exactly solvable at @xmath23 by mapping onto free fermions @xcite .",
    "the 2d tcp undergoes the collapse of positive - negative pairs of pointlike charges at coupling @xmath23 , which corresponds to the exactly solvable free - fermion point of the equivalent thirring model @xcite . for reviews about exactly solvable 2d coulomb systems with various geometries of confining domains ,",
    "@xcite .    at arbitrary temperature of the conducting regime ,",
    "the long - range tail of the coulomb potential induces screening . due to the screening effect , the bulk particle correlations exhibit short - range ( exponential or even gaussian ) decay which indicates a non - criticality . on the other hand",
    ", the same screening phenomenon causes that the induced electrical - field correlations are long - ranged @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the free energy ( or the grand potential ) of any coulomb system exhibits a universal finite - size correction of type ( [ finite - size ] ) . since the logarithmic coulomb potential is the inverse of the laplacian operator @xmath24 , in the functional sense it is associated with the gaussian hamiltonian ( [ gaussh ] ) rewritten as @xmath25 .",
    "although the conformal anomaly number of coulomb systems is expected to be related to the gaussian one , there is a change of sign , namely @xmath26    the explicit checks of the universal finite - size behavior with @xmath1 were done , for both ocp and tcp , at the exactly solvable coupling @xmath23 .",
    "the studied cases involve coulomb gases with periodic boundary conditions @xcite , confined to a domain by plain hard walls @xcite , by ideal - conductor boundaries @xcite and by ideal - dielectric walls @xcite . for coulomb systems living on a surface of the sphere",
    ", a direct derivation of the universal finite - size correction was performed for any coupling by combining stereographic projection of the sphere onto an infinite plane with linear response theory ( tcp , ref .",
    "@xcite ) or with density functional approach ( ocp , ref .",
    "the prefactor to the universal correction term was related to the second moment of the short - range part of the planar direct correlation function . using a renormalized mayer expansion @xcite and observing a cancellation property of specific families of renormalized diagrams , this second moment",
    "was evaluated for both tcp @xcite and ocp @xcite .",
    "another explicit derivation of the universal logarithmic term at an arbitrary coupling constant was made for the tcp in a disk geometry @xcite .",
    "all obtained results confirm the conformal prediction ( [ finite - size ] ) for a critical system as we had @xmath1 .",
    "all that has been said holds for neutral coulomb systems .",
    "recently , ferrero and tllez @xcite studied the 2d tcp of @xmath2 charges at the exactly solvable collapse @xmath23 point , confined to a disk of radius @xmath8 .",
    "they fixed a `` guest '' hard - core impurity of charge @xmath4 at the disk origin and found that the large-@xmath8 expansion for the grand potential of type ( [ finite - size ] ) applies if the conformal anomaly number is modified to @xmath27 presence of the impurity has no effect on bulk and boundary terms .",
    "it has been noted in the same reference that the same modification of the anomaly number occurs when the minimal free boson conformal field theory @xcite , equivalent formally to the 2d tcp , is deformed by spreading out a charge @xmath4 at infinity , creating in this way a non - neutral system .",
    "the equivalence of the two systems , one with a charge fixed at the disk origin and one with the same charge spread out at infinity , can be explained by noting that a charge fixed at the disk origin is screened at microscopic distances by counterions from the tcp and thus the universal large-@xmath8 correction looks like the one for a non - neutral system with the net charge @xmath4 .",
    "notice that the definition of @xmath16 in refs .",
    "@xcite has opposite sign with respect to the standard notation used in this paper . at an arbitrary @xmath28 ,",
    "conformal field theory @xcite yields @xmath29 with this conformal number , the logarithmic correction in ( [ finite - size ] ) is no longer universal , its prefactor depends on both the coupling constant and the excess charge .    in this paper , we concentrate on the non - neutral 2d ocp confined to the disk .",
    "we perform a microscopic derivation of the finite - size expansion of the free energy and find that it is of type ( [ finite - size ] ) with the same anomaly number ( [ cqgamma ] ) as found for the 2d tcp in the context of conformal field theories .",
    "we would like to note that in contrast to the previous studies @xcite of charge fluctuations in finite coulomb systems in a much larger overall neutral system or with particle reservoir put at infinity , here we consider non - neutral systems within the constrained canonical ensemble with the fixed net charge and look for the dependence of finite - size corrections of the free energy on this excess charge .",

    "2 , we derive the total energy of mobile charged particles and the fixed background in presence of non - neutrality .",
