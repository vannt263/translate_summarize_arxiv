    "the last years of research have emphasized the importance of fluctuations in understanding glassy phenomena .",
    "the present comprehension of long lived dynamical heterogeneities in supercooled liquids compares the growth of their typical size to the appearance of long range correlations at second order phase transition points @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "in supercooled liquids , the theoretical study of these correlations beyond the mean field is just at an embryonic level .",
    "it has been recently proposed that the putative discontinuous dynamical transition of mode coupling theory , which is present when all activated processes are neglected , belongs to the universality class of the unstable @xmath2 theory in a random field ( @xmath2-rfim in the following ) @xcite .",
    "however in real systems the activated processes can not be neglected , the only remnant of the transition is a dynamical crossover and it is not clear if there is a range where the prediction of the theory can be tested .    in usual phase transition",
    "often we have a line of first order transitions that ends at a second order terminal critical point . the most popular case",
    "are ferromagnets : at low temperatures there is a first order transition when the magnetic field crosses zero ( the magnetization has a discontinuity ) and this transition lines end at the usual critical point . the same phenomenon happen for the gas liquid transition : it is a first order transition at low temperatures that ends in a second order transition at the critical point .",
    "a similar situation can occur for liquids undergoing a glass transition , where lines of discontinuous glass transitions can terminate in critical points . in this note",
    "we focus our attention to these terminal points , where the glass transition becomes continuous and activation does not play a major role in establishing equilibrium .",
    "this transition has both a dynamic and a thermodynamic character , and it is not necessarily wiped out in finite dimension .",
    "glassy critical points have been theoretically studied in detail both at the dynamic and at the thermodynamic level . in dynamical mode coupling theory (",
    "mct)@xcite these are known as @xmath3 singularities , and have been recently observed in simulations of kinetically constrained models on bethe lattice @xcite . at the thermodynamic level",
    "they are known from mean field spin glass models @xcite and integral equations approximations of liquid theory @xcite . at these points",
    "the discontinuity in the edwards - anderson non - ergodicity parameter vanishes and correspondingly , the separation of dynamics in alpha and beta regime is blurred .",
    "on approaching the critical points from the discontinuous transition side the mct exponents characterizing the beta relaxation go to zero and the alpha relaxation follows a universal scaling function @xcite . in general bulk liquids display a discontinuous transition pattern .",
    "however , the transition can become continuous for a particular choice of the parameters , e.g. in presence of constraints or of quenched disorder .",
    "it has been argued that within mct the glass transition can become continuous for liquids are confined in porous media @xcite .",
    "if one studies the transition as a function of the spatial density of the confining matrix @xmath4 , one finds lines of discontinuous dynamic and thermodynamic transition that get displaced at lower and lower liquid densities , until they merge at a common critical point where the transition becomes continuous . from the theoretical side a suitable way of constraining a glassy system",
    "consists in introducing a `` pinning field '' term in the hamiltonian pushing the system in the direction of a randomly chosen reference equilibrium configuration . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed a phase diagram in the plane of temperature and pinning field , showing lines of first order dynamical and thermodynamical transition that merge and terminate in a common critical point as reproduced in figure 1 .",
    "this view , based on simple spin glass models , was confirmed for liquids in the replica hypernetted chain approximation in @xcite and supported by numerical simulation of realistic model liquids in @xcite .",
    "phase diagram in the plane of temperature and pinning field in a schematic mean field system . at small temperatures for large values of the pinning field",
    "the system at equilibrium stays near the reference configuration ( high overlap phase ) while at small values of the pinning field the system stays far from the reference configuration ( low overlap phase ) .",
    "the upper curve is line of dynamical transition below which a dynamically stable high overlap phase exist .",
    "the middle curve is the thermodynamic first order transition line between the low overlap and the high overlap phases .",
    "the lower curve is the spinodal of the high overlap phase , i.e. the point where it becomes unstable .",
    "the three curves terminate in the critical terminal point .",
    "( figure from : s. franz and g.parisi , prl * 79 * 2486 ( 1997 ) ) . ]    more recently , the interest for the phase diagram of constrained systems has been renewed by liquid simulations where a finite fraction of the particles are frozen to the position they take in a selected equilibrium configuration@xcite .",
    "the effect of the frozen particles is similar to the one of an adsorbing matrix in a porous medium or of a pinning field , with the important addition that in this case the unfrozen particles remain in the original equilibrium state .",
    "the detailed phase diagram for spin models on random graphs was computed in @xcite .",
    "a theoretical discussion of the physical relevance of this situation for liquids and glasses and an exact computation for the mean field @xmath1-spin models were presented in @xcite . differently from the case of the pinning field where the field transforms the glass transition into first order and spinodal transitions , in the case of frozen particles the dynamic and thermodynamic transition lines keep with their glassy random first order character that one finds at zero pinning .    in all these cases ,",
    "the existence of a critical terminal point is interesting because while the dynamical critical line has to disappear in finite dimension thanks to dynamical activation , the critical terminal point , which is also the terminating point of the thermodynamic transition line could survive in finite dimensions and can be studied in numerical simulations and experiments .",
    "as it is usual for lines of phase transitions terminating in a critical point , the critical terminal point lies in a different universality class of the line .",
    "the critical properties of discontinuous dynamical transitions has been recently analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the time independent part of the fluctuations in the @xmath5 and early @xmath6 dynamical regimes admit a description in terms of a cubic replica field theory .",
    "the leading singularities of this theory in perturbation theory happen to coincide with the ones of a @xmath2 field theory in a random magnetic field .",
    "at the critical point the coefficient of the @xmath2 term vanishes and it is natural to make the hypothesis that the next relevant term is a @xmath0 term so that the resulting theory is the standard @xmath0-rfim @xcite .    arguments in this direction have been put forward in @xcite using a rg procedure .",
    "unfortunately , the arguments in @xcite , though suggestive , are not fully convincing .",
    "they are based on a migdal - kadanoff renormalization scheme , which uses a hybrid formalism where replicas are used to average out the randomness in couplings , but additional quenched disorder introduced to mimics the effect of the frozen particle is kept unaveraged .    in this paper",
    "we use the tools of replica field theory to support the hypothesis that glassy critical points are in the universality class of the @xmath0-rfim .",
    "we analyze in detail the case of a dynamical transition line terminating in a critical point .",
    "such a scenario applies exactly in the case in which a finite fraction of particles are pinned in an equilibrium condition .",
    "the case of a pinning field or of an adsorbing matrix presents additional complications that will be left to future work .",
    "replica field theory can be used to find out the nature of this transition .",
    "we have to consider a system with @xmath7 clone in presence of some constraint : when the number @xmath7 of components goes to 1 , one of the clones is at equilibrium and the other clones feel the effect of a quenched field .",
    "since one does not specify which of the clones is privileged the final theory is replica symmetric . from a field",
    "theoretical perspective , at first site the rfim hypothesis is self - evident : indeed if we take care of the leading terms , the replica theory corresponds to theory with a random temperature , that maps on a theory with a potential @xmath8 with a random magnetic field and the critical terminal point is described by a @xmath0 interaction .",
    "however this argument holds only for the leading terms and neglects sub - leading orders that may play a crucial role if the leading terms cancels .",
    "more precisely the mapping of the dynamical transition to the @xmath2-rfim comes from the extraction of the most singular contribution of a cubic replica field theory , with multiple fields of different scaling dimension .",
    "the neglected sub - leading terms turn out to become dimensionally relevant below dimension 6 , the same dimension as the quartic terms of the @xmath0-rfim .",
    "the contribution of cubic vertexes can not therefore be directly dismissed on the basis of dimensional analysis . to understand the nature of the terminal critical point and the possibility of cancellations that restore the rfim mapping , a careful analysis of the perturbative series",
    "is needed .",
    "the scope of this note is to investigate this problem at the level of ginzburg criterion , computing the one loop corrections to the propagators due to the residual cubic vertexes and comparing them to the ones coming from the quartic terms .",
    "we find that a - priori unexpected cancellations are present so that the cubic vertexes contributions appear to be irrelevant as compared to the quartic ones .    in order to test our theoretical results",
    ", we consider a diluted @xmath1-spin model ( random xor - sat problem ) on a random graph in presence of frozen spins and perform extensive numerical simulations to study finite size scaling close to the critical point .",
    "the simulations on large systems fully confirm our analysis , making us confident that the one - loop result indeed holds to all orders .    in the next section we present the theoretical analysis . in the subsequent one the numerical simulation .",
    "we then conclude the paper .",
    "an appendix is devoted to the technical details of the theoretical computations .",
    "our starting point is the replica field theory @xcite    @xmath9    where the field @xmath10 is an @xmath11 space dependent matrix order parameter with vanishing diagonal terms , describing the fluctuations of the correlation function around its plateau value . among all possible cubic replica invariant",
    "we have retained only the ones giving rise to the leading and possible next to leading singular behavior .",
    "it has been show in @xcite that in the limit @xmath12 the theory describe fluctuations close to the dynamical transition , that occurs for @xmath13 ( while @xmath14 and @xmath15 remain finite ) .    according to the discussion in @xcite the components of the matrix @xmath16",
    "do not share a unique scaling dimension .",
    "similarly to what found in the rfim problem @xcite , in order to use dimensional analysis one needs to change basis and define linear combinations @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the @xmath16 that exhibit good scaling properties . the actual linear transformation reeds @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a size two band matrix and @xmath19 is a symmetric matrix null on the diagonal and such that @xmath22 the analysis of the resulting quadratic form ( see below ) shows that @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 have well defined scaling dimension @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 that , fixing the dimension @xmath26 , verify @xmath27 and @xmath28 . fixing the dimension of @xmath17 by the condition",
    "that the action is adimensional one finds @xmath29 .",
    "notice that if the normalization of the dimension would be fixed by the condition that the dimension of the momentum is one , we should multiply all dimensions by a factor two .    in terms of the new fields",
    ", keeping only the terms giving rise to the leading singularities in perturbation theory and sending @xmath30 , one finds that ( [ rft ] ) is equivalent to the parisi - sourlas action @xcite    @xmath31    where the matrix of fields @xmath32 has @xmath33 independent components .",
    "these fields enter quadratically in ( [ fin ] ) .",
    "explicit integration over them gives rise to a determinant to the power that tends to @xmath34 for @xmath35 and is equivalent to the one generated by fermion fields .",

    "we should therefore consider quartic terms and sub - leading cubic ones .",
    "dimensional analysis , through repeated use of ( [ trasf ] ) , shows that among all possible quartic replica symmetric invariants , the most singular ones are @xmath40 that after the change of basis the leading terms ( lowest scaling dimension ) give rise to the rfim terms @xmath41 .",

    "needs in principle to consider the cubic vertexes that do not vanish for @xmath38 . among these , the ones of higher scaling dimension are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which for @xmath38 give rise to the term @xmath45 .",
    "this term does not have evident reasons to vanish .",
    "its superficial scaling dimension ( when multiplied by @xmath46 ) is @xmath47 and in absence of additional cancellations is would also become relevant below 6 dimensions .",
    "the relevance of these vertexes would spoil the equivalence with the rfim at the critical point .    in order to investigate the possible relevance of these terms in the action we could in principle analyze their contribution to the correlation functions of the various fields in perturbation theory . to do",
    "this one needs to keep into account the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) which give rise to some cumbersome combinatorics .",
    "we have preferred therefore to turn back to the original replica field theory ( [ rft ] ) and compute the exact contribution of the cubic vertexes to the self - energy and to the correlation functions to the one loop level .",
    "the diagrams contributing to the self - energy of a generic cubic theory are depicted in fig .",
    "2 , they are the diagrams irreducible against cuts that separate the ending points @xcite .",

    "the formal expression of the diagrams of fig .",
    "2 is given in the appendix .",
    "fortunately , the computation of the diagrams , which basically involves sums of constants and delta functions over replica indexes and momentum integration , can be fully automatized .",
    "we have achieved this goal using the algebraic manipulator mathematica , defining functions that implement the kronecker delta on the one hand and the sum of constants and delta functions on the other . in order to compute the contribution to the correlation function one",
    "needs to further multiply the resulting expression to the right and to the left by the bare propagator , which can also be done by automatic means .",
    "the result for the corrections to the correlation function can be cast in a form similar to the one of the bare propagator ( [ bareprop ] ) , parametrized by three numbers @xmath58 analogous to the @xmath39 s of ( [ bareprop ] ) .",
    "the resulting expressions , available upon request , are rather lengthy and we do not reproduce them here . for @xmath59",
    "the leading singularity behaves as @xmath60 , with corrective terms of order @xmath61 and higher . comparing the leading contribution with the behavior of the bare propagator",
    "@xmath62 one sees that , as already found with the @xmath2-rfim mapping of @xcite , non gaussian fluctuations become important below dimension 8 . for @xmath38",
    "the leading terms vanish .",
    "remarkably the computation shows that at the same time the corrective terms of order @xmath61 , also vanish .",
    "in fact these contributions are proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the first non vanishing contributions are of order @xmath64 .",
    "these are irrelevant down to dimension 4 , as opposed to the quartic rfim contribution which become relevant in dimension 6 .",
    "this result proves the @xmath0-rfim mapping to the one loop order in perturbation theory . though we believe the result to be valid to all orders the general mechanism for cancellation of the contribution of the cubic vertexes remains to be found",
    ". it would be tempting to think that for @xmath35 the fields @xmath32 in ( [ trasf ] ) verify fermionic algebraical relations that go beyond the simple identification of the replica determinant with the fermionic one that was used in @xcite .",
    "in order to check whether the universality class of the terminal critical point is that of a @xmath0-rfim we have simulated the 3-spin model on a random regular graph with fixed degree @xmath65 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath66 where @xmath67 are @xmath68 ising variables and the @xmath69 indexes @xmath70 are randomly chosen such that each variable appears exactly @xmath71 times and each interaction involves 3 different variables .",
    "the couplings are independent random binary variables , generated according to @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the thermodynamical limit ,",
    "the model has been solved with the cavity method @xcite and presents a dynamical phase transition at a temperature @xmath74 @xcite , followed by kauzmann ideal glass transition at a lower temperature @xmath75 . as long as @xmath76",
    ", the thermodynamical and dynamical properties of the model do not depend on the choice of the coupling bias @xmath77 , because almost any coupling configuration has the same free energy , thanks to the fact that the annealed average equals the quenched one ( @xmath78 ) . in particular we can choose the couplings according to the nishimori prescription @xcite that corresponds to @xmath79 .",
    "this choice has the great advantage that the all - spin - up configuration @xmath80 is an equilibrium configuration and we can use it as the starting configuration for the study of the equilibrium dynamics and also as the initial configuration for a monte carlo simulation , which does not require thermalization @xcite .",
    "we are interested in studying the 3-spin model defined above , when a fraction @xmath81 of variables are frozen to an equilibrium configuration ( the all - spin - up configuration in the present case ) .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath82 plane resembles closely the one derived in @xcite for the 3-xorsat model   at @xmath83 .",
    "phase transitions takes place varying @xmath6 , which plays the same role of the temperature in thermal models . ] in the @xmath84 plane ( see fig.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also very similar to the one derived in @xcite for the spherical 3-spin model .     of frozen variables in the 3-spin model on a random regular graph with a fixed degree @xmath65 .",
    "critical temperatures are shown with error ; the curve is just a guide for the eyes , not a fit . ]    in fig .",
    "[ td ] we show the numerical data for the dynamical critical temperatures as a function of @xmath81 obtained by the cavity method . all the critical points shown ( but the terminal point that we discuss in the following ) as been obtained by looking at the overlap with the reference equilibrium configuration ( @xmath80 ) : the dynamical critical temperature corresponds to the negative jump in this overlap when the temperature is slowly increased .",
    "a much more careful discussion requires the determination of the terminal critical point , that we estimate to be located in @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "indeed at the terminal critical point the phase transition is no longer of first order and there is no jump in the overlap with the reference configuration to be exploited ( even for @xmath87 but close to the terminal point the jump is so small that is not useful to estimate the transition location ) . on the contrary ,",
    "for @xmath88 the model has no phase transition at all and one can at most look at the precursors of the continuous phase transition taking place at the terminal critical point .",
    "the problem of locating the terminal critical point with high accuracy is delicate and we have followed a method based on solving the cavity equations in population , while looking at the instability parameter @xmath89 .",
    "more precisely , we run the belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm for determining the fixed point distribution of cavity magnetizations @xmath90 that solves the equation @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "then we have computed the local stability of the fixed point distribution by adding a small perturbation to each element @xmath93 of the population and checking whether such a perturbation grows or decreases under bp iterations : the stability parameter @xmath89 is defined such that the perturbation goes like @xmath94 for large times @xmath95 .",
    "so the fixed point is stable only if @xmath96 . in a discontinuous transition the condition @xmath97 identifies the spinodal points where the two states becomes locally unstable ; while in a continuous transition the condition @xmath97 marks the unique critical point .     as a function of the overlap @xmath98 with the reference configuration for two values of the fraction of frozen variables @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "data points are from fixed point distributions measured at several different temperatures around the critical one .",
    "curves are the best fitting quartic polynomials .",
    "data at @xmath101 show a discontinuous transition , while data at @xmath100 show the absence of any critical point . in this plot , the terminal critical point @xmath102 would correspond to a maximum @xmath89 value equal to 0 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] we show the stability parameter @xmath89 as a function of the overlap @xmath98 with the equilibrium reference configuration .",
    "for each value of @xmath81 , the plot contains few tens of thousands of points measured at different temperatures around the critical one ( both above and below the critical temperature ) .",
    "the noise in the data is due to the stochastic nature of the bp algorithm and to fluctuations related to the finiteness of the population ( we have used populations of sizes @xmath103 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath89 mainly depends on @xmath98 , while its dependence on the temperature is rather weak : indeed fig .",
    "[ lambda ] shows data measured at different temperatures that lay on the same curve .",
    "the interpolating curves shown in fig .  [ lambda ] are quartic polynomials . for @xmath101",
    "the model undergoes a discontinuous phase transition : the two @xmath98 values for which @xmath97 bracket an interval where no state can exist in the thermodynamical limit ( since it would be locally unstable ) ; by varying the temperature , the thermodynamic overlap has a jump not smaller than the size of this interval .",
    "moreover the larger overlap where @xmath97 is the plateau value at the dynamical critical temperature @xmath104 . for @xmath100 the stability parameter @xmath89 never becomes positive and consequently the model has a unique paramagnetic phase and no phase transition .",
    "the @xmath102 value of the terminal critical point is clearly in between these two @xmath81 values and for @xmath105 the @xmath106 function must have a maximum of height @xmath97 .",
    "the quartic interpolations shown in fig .  [ lambda ] allow us to obtain reliable estimate of position and height of the maximum of the function @xmath106 for each @xmath81 value .",
    "fitting these maxima we then arrive at the following estimates for the terminal critical point : @xmath85 and @xmath107 .",
    "the lowest dataset shows a clear hysteresis cycle at the first order phase transition .",
    "the data plotted with a black line have been measured at the critical @xmath102 .",
    "the horizontal line is the critical value for the overlap . ]    a reliable way to estimate the temperature of the terminal critical point is by plotting the average overlap as a function of the temperature for @xmath81 values at and around @xmath102 ( see fig .",
    "[ mediaq ] ) . in this way",
    "we can estimate @xmath108 as the temperature at which the average overlap measured at @xmath102 reaches the critical value @xmath109 .",
    "the uncertainty on this value comes both form the statistical error in this fitting procedure and from the propagation of the uncertainty on the value @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "[ mediaq ] we plot data for several @xmath81 values such that one can appreciate how much the average overlap changes by varying @xmath81 . the final estimate for the temperature of the terminal critical point is @xmath86 .",
    "the error is mainly given by the uncertainty on the value of @xmath102 .",
    "once we have obtained a reliable estimate for the location of the terminal critical point , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we have run extensive monte carlo simulations for those critical parameters .",
    "we have simulated sizes up to @xmath110 . for each size , but the largest , we have simulated @xmath111 different samples ( for the largest size only 2500 samples were used ) .",
    "thermalization is not an issue , given that the all - spin - up configuration is an equilibrium configuration by construction .",
    "as already discussed in detail in @xcite , there are 3 different sources of randomness in this model : the coupling configuration , the starting equilibrium spin configuration and the thermal noise .",
    "thanks to the fact the annealed approximation is exact in this model above @xmath75 , in the thermodynamical limit every sample behaves exactly the same , when the average over starting configurations and thermal noise is performed .",
    "however , we do not take the average over many initial spin configurations , and we only use @xmath80 as the starting configuration to avoid thermalization .",
    "so , the average over the many coupling configurations we consider does actually correspond to the average over the initial spin configurations : indeed we could gauge transform each sample in order to have roughly the same couplings and the initial spin configuration would change from sample to sample .",
    "so , we are left we only 2 sources of randomness : heterogeneities in the initial configuration ( _ het _ ) and thermal noise ( _ th _ ) .",
    "using the angular brackets for the thermal average and the square brackets for the average over the initial spin configurations , two different susceptibilities can be defined as follows @xmath112\\;,\\\\ \\chi_{het } & = & n \\left(\\left[\\langle q \\rangle^2\\right ] - [ \\langle q \\rangle]^2\\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the former measures thermal fluctuations within the same sample ( averaged over the samples ) , while the latter quantifies sample to sample fluctuations in the mean value of @xmath98 ( which is as usual the overlap with the equilibrium reference configuration ) .",
    "the total susceptibility is the sum of the two : @xmath113 - [ \\langle q \\rangle]^2\\right ) = \\chi_{th } + \\chi_{het}$ ] .",
    "a dimensional analysis of action of the @xmath0-rfim leads straightforwardly to the following scaling relations for the susceptibilities @xmath114 in fig .  [",
    "scaled ] we show the data collapse using the theoretically predicted exponents .",
    "we can see that the scaling for the largest fluctuations , @xmath115 , is very well verified , while some corrections to the scaling are still present in the data for the thermal fluctuations at the sizes we have simulated .",
    "( above ) and over the initial heterogeneities @xmath115 ( below ) rescaled according to the exponents predicted by a @xmath0-rfim theory , for comparison in the inset we plot the same quantity using the scaling appropriate for the @xmath2-rfim .",
