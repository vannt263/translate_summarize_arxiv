    "the current neutrino experiments have confirmed both the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies @xcite .",
    "there exist a large class of neutrino models ( see e.g. @xcite ) which explain the anomaly and are yet not excluded .",
    "on the other hand , more general model dependent features require certain restrictions on the neutrino spectra ( see e.g. @xcite ) . with in the framework of dimensional deconstruction",
    "@xcite it is interesting to examine the yukawa structure of an ultra - violet complete theory in its infra - red limit .",
    "it was first shown for neutrinos , that by employing non - abelian symmetries on a latticized @xmath0 orbifolding , dimensional deconstruction could lead to an agreement with data @xcite . in a much simpler set - up @xcite",
    ", we will show that the light neutrino mass ( with maximal mixing ) is an outcome of deconstruction which projects out the seesaw operator @xcite .",
    "we first present our basic two - site model which reproduces the seesaw operator along with maximal leptonic mixings in the light neutrino sector .",
    "furthermore , we illustrate the twin combination ( _ i.e. _ , maximal mixing and small mass ) is natural to this set up . in other words",
    ", we elucidate how our simple toy model makes a choice with respect to the form of the yukawa interactions .",
    "let us begin by considering a @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the usual standard model ( sm ) gauge group .",
    "the left - handed lepton doublets are denoted by @xmath3 and the corresponding right - handed charged leptons by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the leptons @xmath6 and @xmath4 transform as @xmath7 under @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 transform as @xmath11 under @xmath12 . to complete the particle content",
    ", we add the right - handed neutrinos @xmath13 and @xmath14 where , @xmath13 transforms as @xmath7 under @xmath8 while @xmath14 transforms as @xmath11 under @xmath12 .",
    "the scalar link field @xmath15 connects as the bi - fundamental representation @xmath16 the neighboring @xmath17 groups .",
    "this field theory is summarized by a moose diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twosites ] .",
    "we follow the conventions for the arrows as used in @xcite .    the corresponding renormalizable yukawa interaction for the neutrino [ yukawa1 ] l_y = y_h",
    "n _ + y_n_+ f n _ + h.c .",
    ", where as usual , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are complex yukawa couplings .",
    "the kinetic term for the link field is l _ & = & ( d_)^d^  , + d_&= & ( _ -ig_1a_1^a t_a+ig_2a_2^at_a )  .",
    "[ phi ] the gauge fields are @xmath20 @xmath21 with the generators ( @xmath22 ) and dimensionless couplings , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to note the absence of bare dirac and majorana mass terms which is due to invariance under the group @xmath25 .",
    "once the link field develops a vev , @xmath26 ( also taken to be the scalar mass ) , the deconstruction scale breaks the @xmath27 symmetry down to the diagonal @xmath28 , thereby eating one adjoint nambu - goldstone multiplet in the process .",
    "the deconstruction scale corresponds to lattice spacing @xmath29 .",
    "the relevant majorana mass matrix in the basis spanned by the neutrino fields @xmath30 takes the form @xmath31    0 & \\!0\\ ! & \\!0\\ ! & y_{\\beta}\\epsilon \\\\[-.5ex ]    y_{\\alpha}\\epsilon & \\!0\\ ! & \\!0\\ ! & fm_x\\\\ [ -.5ex ]   0 & \\!y_{\\beta}\\epsilon\\ ! & \\!fm_x\\ ! & 0\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ) ,   \\label{matrix}\\ ] ] where we have @xmath32 as the electroweak scale . at the scale @xmath33 the mass structure in ( [ matrix ] ) results in a light majorana neutrino mass @xmath34 along with",
    "maximal mixing .",
    "thus , starting for shorter length scales , @xmath35 , where we retain a completely renormalizable massless four - dimensional theory , for length scales @xmath36 , the mass matrix in ( [ matrix2 ] ) is identical to the one which arises from the usual dimension - five operator of the type @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , the infra - red limit naturally leads to maximal mixings between the two active neutrino flavors .",
    "this feature of maximal mixings can be easily understood once we realize that in our setup , the link field , @xmath15 , mediates a symmetry between each of the fermions @xmath38 placed at different lattice sites ; which is also reflected in the resulting mass matrix for @xmath39 as observed in ( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "this is retained after symmetry breaking ( when the fermion masses are generated ) , as there exists the diagonal subgroup @xmath28 which respects the symmetry such that the @xmath15 field would transform as @xmath40 . in the gauge sector",
    ", this unbroken symmetry corresponds to the presence of a zero mode .",
    "this can be seen in the kinetic term in ( [ phi ] ) which gives a mass squared matrix to the gauge bosons @xmath41 in the basis @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we have @xmath44    -g_1g_2 & g_2 ^ 2 \\\\   \\end{array } \\right ) ,   \\label{mg}\\ ] ] with the zero mode wave function @xmath45 the dirac sector of the model remains diagonal due to the nature of this construction while maximal mixings are introduced solely from the heavy majorana sector . as a passing remark ,",
    "the spectrum of the resulting light neutrinos are in opposite @xmath46 parities and there is no explicit leptonic @xmath46 violation .",
    "we examine now a generalization to the case of a moose mesh . consider a @xmath47 gauge theory containing five scalar link variables @xmath48 @xmath49 which transform under the @xmath28 gauge groups as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "we will denote the flavor fields @xmath55 by the set @xmath56 of leptons . in our scheme ,",
    "all the leptons associated with @xmath55 carry the same @xmath17 charges and connect the different gauge groups as bi - fundamental representations .",
    "hence , all fermions and scalars are treated identically as link variables ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : moosemesh ] .",
    "specifically , we make the choice @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "after symmetry breaking and giving universal vevs @xmath60 to the @xmath48 fields , the structures of the dirac and majorana mass matrices take the form @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the above , @xmath63 and denotes the corrections to @xmath64 and @xmath65 due to higher order terms ( here up to dimension six ) at scale @xmath66 .",
    "let us now consider an illustrative set of yukawa values : @xmath67 which leads to a familiar pattern of light neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "for the choice @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the ratio @xmath71 , we obtain : ( i ) atmospheric mixing angle @xmath72 ( ii ) @xmath73 . with the atmospheric splitting , @xmath74",
    ", we obtain a normal neutrino mass hierarchy with the solar splitting @xmath75 and the solar mixing , @xmath76 which corresponds to the msw lma - i solution @xcite .",
    "the system predicts an effective neutrinoless double beta decay mass , @xmath77 .    in summary ,",
    "we demonstrate the potential richness of dimensional deconstruction of latticized spatial dimensions for the flavor block of the sm . in this analysis ,",
    "we have limited ourselves to describing the physics of a periodic lattice ; where , we take the two - site model as a periodic interval corresponding to a brillouin zone . in the limit of a large lattice site model ( of size @xmath78 ) , one can draw comparisons to a true extra - dimensional scenario ( of radius @xmath79 ) along with the identifications to the five - dimensional gauges couplings , @xmath80 . here , @xmath81 is taken to be the fifth coordinate .",
