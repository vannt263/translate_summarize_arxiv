    "the suppression is the smallest and the condition for efficient suppression is much more stringent than @xmath198 , while for @xmath0 noise , the pulses with @xmath34 close to @xmath178 remain effective .",
    "however , irrespective of the environment , when the pulse interval gets longer , @xmath199 , there is a crossover from decoherence suppression to decoherence accentuation .",

    "2 ( a ) is that : ( i ) there is no sharp resonance as seen in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) in any environment although the crossover from decoherence suppression to accentuation can still be seen .",
    "( ii ) the condition @xmath202 is not necessary for the suppression of @xmath0 noise .",
    "even very slow pulses @xmath203 can suppress it . the second condition ( ii ) expressed before in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is particularly important in that it is often too stringent for practical implementation with qubits .",
    "note that the crossover behavior expressed in ( i ) is already manifest in the uncertainty relation plotted in fig .",
    ". similar effect also appears in the study of quantum zeno effect where sufficiently frequent measurements suppress the population decay@xcite .",
    "when the measurement is performed less frequently , there is a crossover from quantum zeno effect to the so called quantum anti - zeno effect , where measurement accelerates the decay@xcite .",
    "= .50    = .55 = .50    = .50      we now study the limit of long ( @xmath204 ) and slow ( @xmath205 ) pulses , opposite to the cases considered so far . in this limit",
    ", the pulse hamiltonian can be written as the interaction between the system hamiltonian and the constant field : @xmath206 let us consider the time evolution operator acting on the eigenstate of the total hamiltonian : @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "we take the large @xmath209 limit and consider the first order correction with respect to @xmath210 . using the nondegenerate perturbation theory",
    ", we see that @xmath211 , @xmath212 , where @xmath213 and @xmath214 are eigenstates and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath150 . by expanding ( [ upert ] ) around these unperturbed states ,",
    "we obtain in the large @xmath209 limit , @xmath215 for all @xmath125 .",
    "this implies @xmath216 thus in the limit of large @xmath209 , the system - bath interaction @xmath217 is eliminated .",
    "this effect resembles the quantum zeno effect@xcite in which the decay is suppressed by frequent measurements .",
    "indeed a parallel argument with the quantum zeno effect case is possible ( [ upertexpfinal ] ) and one can show that there is no relaxation in this limit@xcite . from ( [ upertexpfinal ] ) @xmath218\\nn & = & \\mbox{tr } \\left[\\hat{\\rho}(0 )",
    "|n\\rangle\\langle n | \\right ] = p_n(0 ) .",
    "\\label{ssr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the difference here from the quantum zeno effect in @xcite caused by repeated measurements is that the time evolution of the system in this case is unitary .",
    "the effect of the external field in ( [ hv ] ) is to slow down the decay process .",
    "it can in principle provide an alternative method to dynamical decoupling although @xmath209 is often uncontrollable as it is fixed by the design and fluctuations of @xmath209 induce an additional source of decoherence . in fig .",
    "4 , the excited state population is plotted as a function of the strength of the constant external field @xmath209 . for ohmic and super - ohmic cases , frequency renormalization ( ohmic ) and frequency and mass renormalization ( super - ohmic ) terms",
    "are taken into account by introducing counter terms@xcite before applying @xmath209 .",
    "these terms dominant at ultra - short times are not suppressed by the constant field in ( [ hv ] ) while they can be suppressed by the pulse decoupling ( [ hp ] ) as we saw in sec.3.2 and 3.3 . in fig .",
    "4 , the decay can be suppressed from coupling to constant large external field @xmath209 after the renormalization although overall suppression is not so remarkable as decoupling by pulses . in pulse decoupling ,",
    "the effect of the environmental mode with frequency @xmath219 is suppressed , while in the constant field case , for any finite @xmath209 , all the environmental modes upto @xmath220 contribute to decoherence .      in this paper",
    ", we propose a dynamical decoupling scheme for error prevention or deterrence based on the effective spin - boson model we introduced recently .",
    "a train of decoupling pulses with alternating signs creates a fictitious instantaneous hamiltonian evolution .",
    "our analysis does not make any of the conventional approximations such as the born , born - markov , rwa or adiabatic approximation , thus enabling us to probe the system dynamics in a much wider parameter regime including the low temperature , ultra - short time scale and strong external field conditions which are likely to be more relevant for quantum information processing .",
    "we studied this method in a general environment with ohmic , super - ohmic and @xmath0 spectral density functions . in all cases , in our decoupling scheme , there is no saturation of decoherence rate due to resonance as reported in previous studies using bang - bang controls .",
    "we saw the smooth crossover from suppression to accentuation of decoherence in our model that extends in a wide range of pulse durations .",
    "in particular , our method can suppress @xmath0 noise with much slower pulses than previously studied . due to",
    "the shielding of high energy modes in the environment as a result of defect motion , decoherence caused by telegraph noise is weaker at short times than that by @xmath0 noise from the harmonic environment discussed in this paper .",
    "thus we expect our pulse decoupling method could also provide efficient suppression of telegraph type noises .    for efficient suppression of decoherence from an ohmic environment ,",
    "the pulse parameter needs to satisfy @xmath193 and the pulses need to be fast compared to the uv cutoff , which is difficult to implement . for 1/f noise , @xmath194 ,",
    "thus the pulses can be reasonably slow and our scheme is relatively easy to implement .",
    "however , for super - ohmic environment , @xmath221 and the pulses need to be ultra - fast .",
    "thus the most serious obstacle for the implementation of quantum computing may be the presence of super - ohmic environments .",
    "we also studied the effect of strong constant field on the population decay .",
    "the decay process appears to slow down but the suppression is not so evident compared to the fast pulse decoupling .    in reality , we may not know enough information about the environment to identify the possible sources of decoherence @xcite .",
    "but one can cleverly reverse the argument here and propose to use our decoupling method to obtain information about the environment spectrum by measuring the decoherence rate with changing pulse intervals .",
    "for instance , if the value of @xmath222 at which the crossover between decoherence suppression and accentuation occurs is greater than @xmath223 , the environment has sub - ohmic spectrum . if smaller than @xmath223 , super - ohmic .    at this point , we are not aware of any experimental results on super - ohmic environments . since an electromagnetic field seen by a charged electron due to charge - field interaction in a three dimensional space is a super - ohmic environment@xcite we expect this type of environment to be rather ubiquitous than peculiar . while the @xmath0 noise due to charge - fluctuations in coulomb forces are frequently observed and more dominant , super - ohmic noise due to charge - photon interaction is likely to coexist with @xmath0 noise .",
    "however , the short time dominant characteristics of super - ohmic noise will make the actual detection very difficult .    in quantum computation with multiqubits ,",
    "the entanglement among qubits is used as a resource for the speed - up of computation based on quantum algorithm . in the presence of entangling operation ,",
    "the propagation of error in the whole computing space is unavoidable . to overcome this , fault tolerance is required in quantum error correction schemes@xcite .",
    "the spreading of non - markovian noise , in particular , noise of the super - ohmic type in the computation architecture can be a serious threat to many proposed fault - tolerant computation schemes @xcite .",
    "our results are readily applicable to the study of quantum aspects in nanomechanical resonators@xcite for which the system is commonly treated as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "esbm@xcite captures the essential short time dynamics common in many qubit models , in which their computational hilbert space is obtained by the lowest two levels of the underlying multi - level structure .",
    "it also allows us to calculate the precise non - markovian time evolution of leakage . the leakage is commonly neglected or crudely estimated in most of the popular theoretical models .",
    "another application of our work is to superconducting josephson junction qubits@xcite , in particular , the phase qubit models@xcite .",
