    "the most important event of last 15 years in astrophysics is conclusion about accelerated expansion of our universe at late stage of its evolution .",
    "this conclusion was based on observations of luminosity distances and redshifts for the type ia supernovae @xcite , cosmic microwave background @xcite , large - scale galaxy clustering @xcite , and other evidence @xcite .    to explain accelerated evolution of the universe various mechanisms",
    "have been suggested , including the most popular cosmological model @xmath0cdm with a @xmath0 term ( dark energy ) and cold dark matter ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model with 4% fraction of visible ( baryonic ) matter nowadays , 23% fraction of dark matter and 73% fraction of dark energy @xcite describes type ia supernovae , data rather well and satisfies observational evidence , connected with rotational curves of galaxies , galaxy clusters and anisotropies of cosmic microwave background .",
    "however , the @xmath0cdm model ( along with vague nature of dark matter and energy ) has some problems with fine tuning of the observed value of @xmath0 , which is many orders of magnitude smaller than expected vacuum energy density , and with different time dependence of dark energy @xmath1 and material @xmath2 fractions ( we have @xmath3 nowadays ) .    therefore a large number of alternative cosmological models have been proposed .",
    "they include theories with extra dimensions @xcite ; matter with nontrivial equations of state , for example , chaplygin gas @xcite ; scalar fields with a potential @xcite ; modified gravity with @xmath4 lagrangian @xcite and many others @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the cosmological model with anisotropic pressure and nontrivial equation of state in @xmath5 dimensions , suggested by pahwa , choudhury and seshadri in ref .",
    "the authors omitted the important case @xmath6 , we include it into consideration .",
    "we also analyze how to modify the equation of state and to avoid `` the end of the world '' ( the finite - time future singularity ) which is inevitable in the model @xcite .    in this model",
    "the @xmath5 dimensional spacetime is symmetric and isotropic in two subspaces : in 3 usual spatial dimensions and in @xmath7 extra dimensions .",
    "it has the following metric with two robertson  walker terms",
    "@xcite : @xmath8 here the signature is @xmath9 , the speed of light @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is are the scale factor and curvature sign in usual dimensions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are corresponding values for extra dimensions .",
    "it is supposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the scale factor @xmath11 grows while @xmath13 diminishes , in other words , some form of dynamical compactification @xcite takes place , a size of compactified @xmath15 is small enough to play no essential role at the tev scale .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite develop the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and suppose that the spacetime ( [ metricind ] ) is filled with a uniform density matter with anisotropic pressure and the following energy - momentum tensor : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the energy density and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the pressure in normal ( extra ) dimensions .",
    "so in normal dimensions pressure is different from that in additional dimensions , while being isotropic within each subspace .    in ref .",
    "@xcite matter in the form of a single fluid is supposed to behave like pressureless dust ( @xmath20 ) in usual dimensions , while in extra dimensions it has appreciable pressure @xmath19 depending on density @xmath17 by a power law @xmath21 with a negative constant @xmath22 .",
    "the latter equation of state resembles a generalized chaplygin gas @xcite . in this model matter ( [ tmn ] ) with anisotropic pressure plays a role of dark energy and source of accelerated expansion .",
    "so the following einstein equation without usual @xmath0 term is considered : @xmath23    to describe the late time acceleration of the universe many authors @xcite used the similar approach , in particular , extra dimensions , a metric of the type ( [ metricind ] ) and the energy - momentum tensor ( [ tmn ] ) . however , the cited authors used different equations of state . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite these equations were linear @xmath24 under these conditions a set of cosmological solutions with power law dependence of @xmath25 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 on @xmath26 was obtained in refs .",
    "but for these solutions an acceleration for @xmath25 and a dynamical compactification or stabilization for @xmath15 are not possible simultaneously .",
    "the similar problem appears in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors use the sum of two perfect fluids with densities @xmath17 and @xmath27 and the equations of state @xmath28 , @xmath29 . in this case for solutions with @xmath30 an acceleration ( @xmath31 ) suppresses any compactification or diminishing for @xmath13 .",
    "the problem of dynamical compactification for the extra dimensions was solved in the paper by mohammedi @xcite under assumptions ( [ metricind ] ) with @xmath32 , ( [ tmn ] ) and the following ansatz : @xmath33 mohammedi constructed solutions with accelerated expansion without a predetermined equation of state . in his approach evolution of values @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 was calculated from the right hand sides if eqs .",

    "relations between these values correspond to equations of state , they appear at the last stage of this scheme .",

    "( [ eosl ] ) are both negative , and also an accelerated expansion of @xmath25 in the late universe is incompatible with dynamical compactification of @xmath15 @xcite .",
