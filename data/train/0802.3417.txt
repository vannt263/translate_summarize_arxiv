    "we have already demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ model ] that these conditions are only satisfied in the condensed regime .",
    "therefore , it is obviously tempting , but wrong to conclude from @xmath229 that the system is second - order coherent .",
    "this misconception is due to the fact that @xmath224 only samples a small part of the first and second - order rdms of the system .",
    "so , how does the decrease of coherence manifest itself in second order correlation functions ? for second - order coherence to be present , at least approximately , also @xmath226 has to be close to one .",

    ", we find that @xmath226 has a complicated behavior and deviates significantly from values close to one , thereby proving that strong correlations are present . note that the interaction between the particles is weak and that the strong correlations are due to the transition from a single to a fragmented condensate .",
    "this transition is in turn induced by a change of the shape of external potential .",
    "varying the shape of the external potential therefore provides a means to introduce strong correlations between the particles . the strongest correlations ( black spots in the third panel of the third row of fig .  [ fig6 ] ) occur at those values where the two - body momentum distribution has local minima . at the values of @xmath230 and @xmath231 ,",
    "where the strongest correlations occur , the one - body and the two - body momentum distributions are _ clearly _ distinct from zero , see third panel in the middle column of fig .  [ fig3 ] and the third panel in the third row of fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "experiments that measure @xmath226 in ultracold quantum gases have been carried out recently , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "the amplitude of the correlations is smaller than in the many - body regime , and the correlations between different momenta are modulated by a single oscillatory structure .",
    "this structure can be well understood within the analytical mean - field model of sec .",
    "[ generalresults2 ] .",
    "the oscillatory part of @xmath226 is determined by the difference of the wave vectors multiplied by the distance between the wells , see eq .",

    "a description of second - order coherence in terms of @xmath224 alone is therefore incomplete .",
    "the corresponding results of the bmf solution agree well with those of the many - body solution as long as the system is not in the many - body regime at intermediate barrier heights . in the many - body regime",
    "the bmf result is inaccurate , but it anticipates the final form of @xmath224 in the fragmented regime .",
    "in this work we have investigated first- and second - order correlations of trapped interacting bosons . for illustration purposes",
    "we have investigated the ground state of @xmath95 weakly interacting bosons in a one - dimensional double - well trap geometry at various barrier heights on a many - body level .",
    "we have obtained the many - body results by solving the many - body schrdinger equation with the recently developed mctdhb method .",
    "this allowed us to compute from first principles the natural orbitals and the natural geminals of a large interacting many - body system , together with their occupation numbers . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first computation of the natural geminals of an interacting many - body system of this size .",
    "depending on the height of the double - well barrier we found that there are three different parameter regimes . at low barriers",
    "the ground state is condensed and the many - body wave function is well approximated by a single permanent of the form @xmath127 . at high barriers",
    "the ground state becomes fully fragmented and can be well approximated by a single permanent of the form @xmath154 . at intermediate barrier heights , where the transition from a single to a fragmented condensate occurs",
    ", the ground state becomes a true many - body wave function to which many permanents contribute .",
    "we have demonstrated that the transition to a fragmented state results in the occupation of a natural geminal that contributes very little to the interaction energy .",
    "the overall energy of the system can be lowered by the occupation of such a geminal , and the ground state becomes fragmented .",
    "we have shown how the transition from a condensed to a fully fragmented ground state manifests itself in the one- and two - particle momentum distributions . however , the transition is _ not _ captured by the one- and two - particle density distributions , not even in the many - body regime .    in order to determine the coherence of the state during the fragmentation transition , we have computed the first- and second - order normalized correlation functions @xmath235 , @xmath224 and @xmath236 . in the condensed regime , a high degree of coherence is indeed present in the ground state wave function .",
    "first and second order correlations were found to be negligible at the interaction strength and particle number chosen for our computation .",
    "however , with increasing barrier height correlations between the momenta of the particles build up .",
    "these correlations were found to be very strong in the many - body regime at intermediate barrier heights .",
    "the ground state at high barriers was found to be correlated , but not as strongly as the ground state at intermediate barrier heights .",
    "while the transition from a virtually uncorrelated state to a correlated one is clearly visible in @xmath235 and @xmath236 , the transition hardly shows up in @xmath224 .",
    "a description of second - order coherence in terms of @xmath224 alone is , therefore , incomplete and can lead to wrong predictions .    for comparison",
    "we have computed results based on ( i ) the best approximation of the many - body wave function within mean - field theory , the bmf wave function , and ( ii ) the gross - pitaevskii solution .",
    "we found that the gp wave function is identical to the bmf solution up to some barrier height .",
    "however , once the true many - body solution starts to fragment the bmf wave function is no longer given by a gp type permanent @xmath127 , but rather by a fragmented state of the form @xmath154 . in the true many - body regime",
    "neither the gp , nor the bmf solution provide an adequate approximation to the many - body wave function , and the predicted correlations are inaccurate .",
    "while the gp mean - field is only accurate at low barrier heights , the bmf solution provides a very good approximation to the true many - body wave function at low _ and _ high barriers .",
    "we have shown that the gp mean - field predicts qualitatively wrong results at high barriers .",
    "the bmf only fails at intermediate barrier heights where the true many - body wave function becomes a superposition of many permanents .",
    "such many - body effects can , by construction , not be captured by mean - field methods .    in the mean - field regimes at high and low barriers",
    "we have provided an analytical mean - field model that allows us to understand the general structure of the computed correlation functions .",
    "our work sheds new light on the first- and second - order correlation functions of interacting many - body systems .",
    "the variation of the shape of the trapping potential allows one to change the physics of the system from mean - field to strongly correlated many - body physics .",
