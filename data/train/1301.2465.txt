    "we adopt the same methods as @xcite for constraining the h@xmath0co distribution , here fitting models that assume a radial power - law (  [ power ] ) and a simple ring with inner boundary at the co `` snow line '' (  [ ring ] ) .      for a first - order analysis of the distribution of h@xmath0co , we model the radial variation in the column density as a power law n@xmath15 between an inner radius r@xmath16 and outer radius r@xmath17 , where n@xmath18 is the column density at 100 au in @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the distance from the star in au , and @xmath21 is the power - law index .    for the vertical distribution , we assume that h@xmath0co is present with a constant abundance in a layer with boundaries toward the midplane and toward the surface of the disk ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption is motivated by chemical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that predict a three - layered structure where most molecules are photodissociated in the surface layer , frozen out in the midplane , and have an abundance that peaks at intermediate disk heights .",
    "the surface ( @xmath22 ) and midplane ( @xmath23 ) boundaries are presented in terms of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hydrogen column density measured from the disk surface .",
    "this simple model approximates the vertical location where h@xmath0co is most abundant .",
    "the excitation of multiple transitions can constrain both @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but in this case of very modest signal - to - noise , we fix @xmath22 to 0.79 , the surface boundary found for co by @xcite , and we fit @xmath23 for the midplane boundary and the power - law parameters ( n@xmath18 , @xmath21 , r@xmath16 and r@xmath17 ) .    using the structure model , we compute a grid of synthetic h@xmath0co visibility datasets over a range of r@xmath17 , r@xmath16 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 and n@xmath18 values and compare with the observations .",

    "we use the two - dimensional monte carlo model ratran @xcite to calculate the radiative transfer and molecular excitation .",

    "we find that @xmath21 is constrained between 0.53.0 ( within 1@xmath28 ) while r@xmath16 is constrained to be @xmath29200 au .",
    "the @xmath26 value does not change significantly for inner radii @xmath2990 au , as expected for the 2@xmath30 beam size of the observations .",

    "figure  [ fig : mod_spec ] shows the h@xmath0co 32 line spectrum compared with the spectra derived from models with different radial column densities power - law indices .",
    "the spectra suggest a lack of high velocity line wings associated with emission originating in the inner regions of the disk , consistent with the results of the @xmath26 analysis .",
    "the positive power - law index found for the h@xmath0co radial distribution implies that h@xmath0co is present mainly in the outer disk .",
    "this is expected if h@xmath0co forms _ in situ _ from co ice hydrogenation and is therefore present mainly beyond the co snow - line , previously determined to be at 160  au by @xcite",
    ". guided by this astrochemical _ ansatz _ , we have tried a second `` ring '' model where the h@xmath0co gas is only present where co has frozen out .",
    "the vertical surface boundary is then defined by the co freeze - out temperature of 19  k @xcite , while the midplane boundary can be constrained by the excitation of multiple h@xmath0co transitions , as in the power - law model . within this layer",
    ", the abundance of h@xmath0co is assumed to follow that of h nuclei with a constant fractional abundance , which is also a parameter fit to the data .",
    "the best - fit abundance is @xmath31 and the midplane boundary @xmath23 is consistent with what we find in the power - law model ( table  [ tab : best - fit ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] shows that the vertical surface boundary at 19  k effectively results in a ring - like radial structure , where the inner edge of the ring is at co snow line .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] also shows that the best - fit power - law and ring models result in similar h@xmath0co column densities beyond the co snow line .",
    "the profile of the ring model is considerably flatter than the power - law model and even drops outside of 300  au exponentially to the edge of co emission .",
    "figures [ fig:32_chmap][fig:43_chmap ] show that the power - law model and the ring model channel maps display some subtle differences . but both provide good fits to the data within the noise of the sma observations .",
    "the same model also provides a good match to the n@xmath0h@xmath1 flux , but the combination of low signal - to - noise and observations of just one transition preclude any independent modeling of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 distribution .",
    "hd  163296 is very favorable for h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 imaging since its relatively high luminosity and massive disk puts the co snow line at a large angular distance compared to other disks , enabling us to resolve the h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission . without such spatial information , however , we can still obtain a constraint on where h@xmath0co",
    "emission originates in disks based on the average h@xmath0co excitation temperatures . as a gross approximation",
    ", h@xmath0co that coexists with co ice should be cold ,",
    "i.e. present at an excitation temperature comparable to the co freeze - out temperature . to test the viability of using excitation temperatures to constrain the h@xmath0co distribution we extracted spectra from three of the hd  163296 simulations presented in  3.2 , selecting models with the best outer radius , no inner hole and power - law indices of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34",
    ". these distributions approximately correspond to a h@xmath0co abundance that follows the h@xmath0 column , that keeps constant with radius and that increases steeply , forming a ring .",
    "assuming lte , that both h@xmath0co transitions trace the same underlying populations , and a single rotational excitation temperature , @xmath35 , we calculate @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the upper energy levels for the low and high h@xmath0co transitions used in the calculation ( h@xmath0co @xmath39 and @xmath11 for most disks ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 the corresponding line frequencies and temperature independent transition strengths and dipole moments , @xmath42 the integrated line intensity , which is calculated from the integrated fluxes based on @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the flux in jy , @xmath45 the intensity in k , @xmath46 the line wavelength in millimeters , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 the emission diameters in @xmath30 .",
    "because of both vertical and radial temperature gradients in the disk , the size dependence of the emission regions from two transitions is complicated but the emission area is not expected to be very different . for simplicity",
    "we assume the extent of the emission is the same for both transitions on account of the model dependent effects of the temperature gradients .",
    "all of the line parameters were gathered from splatalogue ( a transition - resolved compilation of several spectroscopic databases ) , with the data originating from cdms @xcite .",
    "lte is a reasonable approximation if h@xmath0co is mainly present at high densities .",
    "the critical densities for the observed h@xmath0co transitions vary between 10@xmath49 and 5@xmath5010@xmath51 @xmath52 @xcite , dependent on assumed kinetic temperatures . at radii @xmath29300  au ,",
    "all gas colder than 25 k is at densities higher than 10@xmath53  @xmath52 @xcite , justifying this assumption .    using the simulated spectra we derive an excitation temperature of 27  k for the model with @xmath54 and excitation temperatures close to or below 20  k for the other two models .",
    "excitation temperatures thus provide some constraints on the h@xmath0co distribution , but a temperature close to the expected co freeze - out temperature only implies an increasing abundance with radius ; it can not be used to assess how steeply the abundance increases .    by combining the new h@xmath0co detections toward tw  hya and hd  163296 with h@xmath0co data from discs @xcite",
    ", we have a sample of 10 disks with two h@xmath0co line detections or one h@xmath0co line detection and one upper limit ( table [ tab : star ] ) .",
    "these data are sufficient to calculate excitation temperatures , albeit with substantial uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : temp ] shows the calculated excitation temperatures for 9 of the 10 disks ; the chemically peculiar herbig ae star hd 142527 is not included because its excitation temperature of 250  k is probably not due to thermal excitation .",
    "the h@xmath0co excitation temperature , listed in table [ tab : star ] , is consistent with , or lower than , the co freeze - out temperature of @xmath320  k for all of these disks .",
    "the average h@xmath0co temperature in the sample ( excluding hd  142527 ) is @xmath55  k. we note that the relatively high excitation temperature toward hd  163296 is most likely due to the fact that some h@xmath0co 32 emission is resolved out by the sma observations , as the compact - north antenna configuration has few short baselines .",
    "we examine the disk sources to test if n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0co emission are correlated across the sample , as would be expected if 1 ) the two molecules form under the same physio - chemical conditions , i.e. only in the regions where co has frozen out , 2 ) the line emission trace the total n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0co column well , and 3 ) midplane ionization levels and co hydrogenation efficiencies do not differ ` too much ' across the sample ( i.e. the size of the co freeze - out region is the most important regulator of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0co column across the sample ) .",
    "it should be noted that there are other scenarios that could produce a correlation as well , and that the correlation analysis below should only be considered as a constraint on the h@xmath0co distribution in combination with the results in the previous sections . in particular a constant h@xmath0co / n@xmath0h@xmath1 across a disk sample",
    "would be expected if the relative fractions of chemically characteristic disk regions is always similar in disks .",
    "to conclusively test this requires a larger sample than currently available , but the fact that we did not find that h@xmath0co emission correlates with any other molecular emission than n@xmath0h@xmath1 already challenges this scenario .",
    "where possible , we base the comparison on the h@xmath0co @xmath39 line that has @xmath56  k , similar to n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xmath13 ( @xmath57  k ) , to minimize variations in fluxes caused by the different detailed temperature structures in different disks . excluding hd 142527 ,",
    "this line has been observed toward 6/9 of the sample . for the remaining 3/9 disks , we calculate the expected h@xmath0co @xmath39 line flux based on the h@xmath0co excitation temperatures and fluxes of other h@xmath0co lines toward each source .",
    "we then normalize the flux of each h@xmath0co @xmath39 line to the ( taurus ) distance of 140  pc , and we further normalize to a disk mass of 0.01  m@xmath58 to account for the fact that more nearby and more massive disks tend to have overall stronger line emission .",
    "figure [ fig : corr ] shows that there is a strong correlation between the normalized h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 fluxes in the disk sample ; the rank correlation is statistically significant at the 95% level .",
    "as expected , figure [ fig : corr2 ] shows that this implies a nearly constant n@xmath0h@xmath1 3 - 2 / h@xmath0co 3@xmath59 flux ratio across the sample .",
    "our modeling strategy in this study and in @xcite has been to first constrain the overall structure of molecular emission in disks using a parametric model with a minimum of free parameters , i.e. to determine whether the radial column density profile of a species decreases , increases or is flat as a function of disk radius .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the slope of the radial column density profile already can place significant constraints on the formation pathway of a molecule . here",
    "we find that h@xmath0co toward hd  163296 belongs to the family of molecules that display an increasing column density with radius .",
    "this first - order constraint on the h@xmath0co distribution motivated us to consider h@xmath0co formation pathways that would result in an increase of h@xmath0co with disk radius .",
    "h@xmath0co formation through co - ice hydrogenation results in a simple prediction that h@xmath0co should be present in a ring , with the inner edge at the co snow line .",
    "we therefore set up a second model , based on this prediction , to test if the observations are consistent with this hypothesis for h@xmath0co formation .",
    "we propose that this combination of backward and forward modeling both provides a fair view of the constraints obtained by fitting the data , and challenges our basic understanding of disk chemistry .",
    "h@xmath0co can form through multiple chemical pathways .",
    "we have shown that the h@xmath0co distribution towards hd  163296 and the sample statistics are consistent with formation through _ in situ _ co ice hydrogenation . here",
    "we consider the effects of additional pathways for h@xmath0co formation , in particular ( 1 ) _ in situ _ gas phase formation , and ( 2 ) formation in the pre- and proto - stellar phases , followed by incorporation into the disk .",
    "h@xmath0co can form in the gas - phase through ion - neutral reactions involving , e.g. ch@xmath60 or through neutral - neutral reactions between ch@xmath4 and o ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the neutral - neutral formation pathway is expected to result in a radially flat column density structure for a typical t tauri disk @xcite , with most emission originating at temperatures of 20 - 40  k @xcite .",
    "it is not clear from existing disk models whether the structure will look substantially different if the neutral - ion reactions dominate . in a protostellar chemistry model @xcite",
    ", ch@xmath60 disappears when co depletes ( e. bergin , private communication ) .",
    "this suggests that h@xmath0co forming through this pathway should be anti - correlated with co - freeze - out .",
    "neither of these gas - phase pathways thus predicts excess h@xmath0co column densities in the outer disk , or at low ( t@xmath2920  k ) temperatures .",
    "the observed low excitation temperature could on its own be explained by efficient turbulent mixing of h@xmath0co formed in the gas - phase and then cooled down in the midplane regions , similarly to what has been proposed to explain cold co gas in disks @xcite .",
    "turbulent mixing would not , however , explain the observed deficiency of h@xmath0co towards the inner disk in hd  163296 .",
    "gas - phase formation of h@xmath0co then seems an unlikely dominant source of h@xmath0co in disks in light of the new observations , but the case is unlikely to be conclusively settled until the exclusive grain - surface product ch@xmath4oh is observed to display a similar distribution .",
    "h@xmath0co in disks could be a product of protostellar or molecular cloud chemistry , as h@xmath0co is commonly observed in pre- and protostellar sources , and this molecular content may be preserved , at least in part , through the process of disk formation .",
    "@xcite has modeled this scenario , starting with a h@xmath0co ice abundance of 10@xmath61 inherited from the cold cloud .",
    "the model also includes h@xmath0co formation through gas - phase processes in the disk and results are presented with and without photodesorption . in the model without photodesorption , h@xmath0co follows co in the inner disk and has an additional outer disk component with an abundance that decreases with radius beyond the co snow line . when photodesorption is included , the h@xmath0co column is flat across the disk , corresponding to a power - law index of 0 .",
    "neither predicted abundance pattern is consistent with the new observations .",
    "in addition , h@xmath0co is common towards protostellar sources of a range of luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , while it is pre - dominantly detected towards disks around the low luminosity t tauri stars .    in short , h@xmath0co formation through _ in situ _ co - ice hydrogenation is not only consistent with the observations , but it is the _ only _ pathway proposed ( so far ) that naturally explains the observations . to conclusively demonstrate a co - ice hydrogenation origin would , however , require the detection of co - spatial emission of ch@xmath4oh ; ch@xmath4oh has no known efficient gas - phase formation pathway and is predicted to form together with h@xmath0co whenever co ice is hydrogenated @xcite .",
    "the `` snow line '' is typically used to denote the midplane disk radius at which the temperature is low enough for water to condense out on dust grains .",
    "outside of the snow line , grain accretion will be faster because of larger and stickier grains , which may substantially speed up the formation of planetesimals and eventually planets ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    ". in the solar system , the dividing line between rocky planets and gas giants coincide with the h@xmath0o snow line @xcite .",
    "co is another abundant volatile in disks and its snow line may boost planet formation in the outer disk by providing extra solid masses @xcite and inducing planet traps @xcite , and could affect the elemental make - up of the forming gas - giants @xcite . because of its high volatility ( @xmath62  k ) , the co snow line is expected at disk radii of 10s100s of au . this should make it a far more accessible target than the h@xmath0o snow line for millimeter interferometry studies aimed at examining the general effects of snow lines on disk structures .",
    "localizing the co snow line directly from millimeter co data is challenging , however .",
    "disks have both a radial temperature gradient away from the central star , and a vertical one set by radiative heating at the disk surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a co condensation front that is located at different radii at different disk heights ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) , and also that some co is present at all radii in the upper disk layers .",
    "this fact , together with a complex radiative transfer ( most co lines are expected to be optically thick in the disk center and optically thin in the outer parts of the disk ) , means that the location of a co snow line in a disk can not be inferred from simply inspecting a co disk image .",
    "the best constraint that exists to date on a co snow line radius is toward the herbig ae star hd  163296 based on the analysis of multi - transition , multi - isotope , spatially resolved co line data on a self - consistent physical disk model @xcite .",
    "the temperature structure of the model has been constrained by optically thick multiple co lines and detailed analysis of the optically thinner @xmath63co emission reveals a significant column density reduction at around 165 au that can not be explained by the overall disk column distribution as traced by the dust .",
    "this is interpreted as the result of co freeze - out and the location as the co snow line .",
    "uncertainties in the temperature structure will mainly affect the determination of the co freeze - out temperature at the location of the co snow line , rather than the location itself , which is constrained between 135 and 175  au in the disk of hd  163296 . while fruitful , this is a time consuming approach that will be difficult to apply to larger samples of disks and will always include some degree of model dependency .",
    "another approach to constrain the co snow line location is to identify trace species that are only present where co has begun to freeze out .",
    "such molecules should display a ring - like structure with the inner edge corresponding to the midplane co snow line .",
    "as we have described , n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0co are good candidate probes of co snow lines . in principle , these species can be used as powerful chemical imaging tools to constrain co snow line locations in large samples of disks , rather than relying on complex analysis of the co isotopologue observations .",
    "it seems clear that both n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0co are outer - disk species from the chemical perspective . to connect their formation to the onset of co freeze - out",
    "conclusively requires a combination of higher sensitivity , and higher resolution imaging .",
    "this kind of imaging can be done with the newly available capabilities of the alma telescope in chile , which is nearing completion of construction .    to demonstrate the astrochemical predictions generated by our analysis of the sma data , and the ease at which they can be tested with alma",
    ", we present a set of simulations of hd  163296 alma observations using the antenna configuration 5 ( corresponding to 0.3  resolution ) in figure [ fig : sim ] .",
    "the predicted h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 rings are readily detected at this resolution , and the power - law and ring models are clearly distinguished .",
    "for both models , the diameter of the emission maximum can be estimated directly from the images within a fraction of the beam size , enabling us to determine if the h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission truly trace the co snow line .",
    "in addition , alma should have sufficient sensitivity to detect ch@xmath4oh if it is present with a similar abundance and distribution as h@xmath0co , as expected if both of these species are formed through co hydrogenation and then non - thermally desorbed .",
    "we have presented three observational results that support the idea that co freeze - out regulates the h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 chemistry in disks :    1 .",
    "h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission towards hd  163296 appears offset from the continuum peak at a size scale consistent with the co snow line at 160  au .",
    "these observations are matched well by a ring model where h@xmath0co is present only in the disk regions with co freeze - out .",
    "the h@xmath0co excitation temperature in a sample of 9 disks is typically below @xmath64  k , consistent with the bulk of h@xmath0co emission originating in disk regions where co is expected to freeze - out .",
    "the h@xmath0co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission are correlated across the disk sample , consistent with the hypothesis of coexistence beyond the co snow line .",
    "these results suggest that both n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0co should be present in rings , with the inner edge at the co snow line .",
    "this may be used as a probe of co snow line locations across samples of disk and is also important for predicting the organic content of comets forming at different disk radii . in general ,",
    "the radial and vertical distributions of molecules constitute strong probes of the basic chemistry used into astrochemical models , while molecular abundances and column densities are probably best used to test our understanding of the structure and history of individual objects .",
