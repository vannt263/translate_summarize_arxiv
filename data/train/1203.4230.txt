    "one of the main scientific objectives of the _ integral _  mission is performing a survey of the sky in a mostly unexplored region of the electromagnetic spectrum : from the hard x - ray to the soft @xmath0-ray band . since its launch in october 2002 , _ integral _  has used the unprecedented imaging capabilities of ibis ( imager on board integral spacecraft : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coupled with those of isgri ( integral soft gamma - ray imager ; * ? ? ?",
    "combining data from these two instruments , it is possible to generate images of the sky with a 12 arcmin ( full width half maximum , fwhm ) resolution with typical source location accuracy of @xmath1 1 - 3 arcmin over a @xmath119 degree ( fwhm ) field of view in the energy range 171000 kev .",
    "the fourth soft @xmath0-ray source catalog @xcite ( hereinafter 4ic ) obtained with the ibis @xmath0-ray imager on board the _ integral _  satellite lists 723 hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray sources . in particular , the 4ic substantially increased the extragalactic sky coverage including both transients and faint persistent objects that can only be revealed with long exposure observations @xcite .",
    "several observations at low energies have been already performed to decrease the number of the unidentified _ integral _  objects ( uiss ) ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for optical and x - ray observations of uiss ) ; however , a considerable fraction of the 4ic sources are still completely unidentified .",
    "according to the 4ic , there are 113 uiss , corresponding to about 16% of the whole catalog , and 178 other sources have uncertain classification . the largest fraction ( i.e. , 35% ) of the associated _ integral _  sources are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , compared to 31% identified as galactic sources @xcite . for comparison , the 58-month catalog of observations with the bat hard x - ray detector on board the _ swift _  observatory , lists 1092 objects detected in the 14 - 195 kev energy range , with 86 unidentified hard x - ray sources listed @xcite .",
    "recently , using the _ wise _  all - sky ir survey , we discovered that blazars , the largest known @xmath0-ray class of agn , can be separated from other extragalactic sources using ir colors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper i ) .",
    "we used the magnitudes of the recent _ wise _  ir all - sky survey performed at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath2 m with an angular resolution of 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 & 12.0 arcsec and with 5@xmath3 point source sensitivities achieving 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 and 6 mjy , in unconfused regions on the ecliptic , respectively .",
    "the absolute ( radial ) differences between _ wise _  source - peaks and  true \" astrometric positions anywhere on the sky are no larger than @xmath1 0.50 , 0.26 , 0.26 , and 1.4 arcsec in the four _ wise _  bands , respectively @xcite .    moreover , we investigated a sample of blazars detected by _ wise _  and associated with _",
    "sources to characterize their ir-@xmath0-ray properties ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper ii ) .",
    "this was the first step to develop a new association method for the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources , able to recognize if there is a @xmath0-ray blazar candidate within their positional error region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper iii and paper iv , respectively ) . with this new ir diagnostic tool , we searched for @xmath0-ray blazar candidates within the unidentified @xmath0-ray source sample of the 2fgl @xmath0-ray catalog , and for the first time we have been able to provide a candidate counterpart for 187 out of 313 unidentified @xmath0-ray sources analyzed , having the same ir properties as the @xmath0-ray emitting blazars ( see paper iv ) .    in this letter , we apply this association procedure to test whether there is a possible @xmath0-ray blazar candidate for the uiss using their _ wise _  ir colors . for the selected @xmath0-ray blazar candidates",
    ", we also search _ swift _  pointed observations for the presence of an optical - uv and/or x - ray counterpart .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sample ] we describe the uis sample selected for our investigation ; in section  [ sec : method ] we illustrate the basic details of our new association method , that , in section  [ sec : uis ] , we apply to the uiss . section  [ sec : swift ] is devoted to the optical - uv - x - ray counterparts in the _ swift _  observations available .",
    "our results are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "in the 4ic there are 113 sources that are completely unidentified ( i.e. , type = ? , according to table 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while there are 97 sources that are indicated as unidentified transients ( i.e. , type = ? ,",
    "t , according to table 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , within the 4ic , there are also 32 agn sources of uncertain type ( i.e. , type = agn ? * ? ? ? * ) and another 49 objects with uncertain classification .    in this letter , we only considered the 86 uiss out of 113 listed in the 4ic that lie in the portion of the sky covered by the _ wise _  preliminary source catalog .",
    "in paper iii , using a subsample of the roma - bzcat blazar catalog @xcite , detected by _ wise _  and associated with _ fermi_-lat   sources ( papers ii and iii ) , we presented the parametrization of the _ wise _",
    "@xmath0-ray strip ( _ wgs _ ) based on the _ strip parameter _ @xmath4 .",
    "this parameter , ranging between 0 - 1 , provides an estimate of the distance between the _ wgs _  and the location of a generic _ wise _  source in the ir color parameter space , and it is weighted for the errors on all the ir colors .",
    "we distinguished between _ wise _",
    "sources that lie in the subregion of the",
    "_ wgs_occupied by the bzbs and bzqs using the @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters separately ( paper iii ) .    in paper iv , we presented the association method based on the _ wgs _  parametrization .",
    "for each unidentified @xmath0-ray source we defined the _ searching region _ corresponding to a circular region of radius @xmath7 equal to the semi - major axis of the elliptical source location region at 99.999% confidence level , centered on the @xmath0-ray position given in the 2fgl catalog@xcite .",
    "we calculate the ir colors for every _ wise _  source that lies within the _ searching region _ as well as their @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters . given the distributions of generic _ wise _  sources in random regions of the sky , we distinguish three classes of @xmath0-ray blazar candidates on the basis of their @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 values :    * class a : _ wise _  sources with 0.24 @xmath8 1.00 and 0.38 @xmath9 1.00 ; * class b : _ wise _  sources with 0.24 @xmath8 1.00 or 0.38 @xmath9 1.00 ; * class c : _ wise _  sources with 0.10 @xmath8 0.24 and 0.14 @xmath9 0.38 .",
    "all the _ wise _  sources with @xmath100.10 or @xmath110.14 are considered _",
    "outliers _ of the _ wgs_. sources of class a are the rarest with respect to the other classes ( paper iv ) .",
    "our association procedure consists in ranking all the _ wise _  sources within the _ searching region _ of an unidentified @xmath0-ray source as described above and indicating as a @xmath0-ray blazar candidate the positionally closest source belonging to the highest class .",
    "our association procedure provides a completeness of 87% based on the _ a posteriori _ re - association of the roma - bzcat blazars , detected by _ wise _  and associated with _",
    "fermi_-lat  sources .",
    "we applied our new association method to the case of the 86 uiss selected above .",
    "this process allows us to verify if there is a @xmath0-ray blazar candidate within the positional error region of each uis analyzed .",
    "we considered a _ searching region _ with radius equal to the position error at 90% confidence level , as reported in the 4ic catalog ; then , we estimated the ir _ wise _  colors for all the sources that lie within the _ searching region_.    running our association procedure , we found that 68 out of 86 uiss have only outliers of the _ wgs _  lying in their _ searching regions _ , while within the remaining 18 uiss we found 4 @xmath0-ray blazar candidates of class a , 12 of class b and 2 of class c. in table 1 , we present the list of @xmath0-ray blazar candidates found for the 18 uiss together with their ir colors , as well as the @xmath5 and @xmath6 parameters .",
    "we also estimated the probability to find a generic _ wise _  source with the same @xmath4 values in 36 random circular regions of the _ wise _  sky having the same radius @xmath7 of the _ searching regions_. we found that this is smaller than 10@xmath12 .",
    "we note that the positional accuracy of the uiss is a least order of magnitude better than that of the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources in 2fgl .    summarizing our results",
    ", we found 18 _ wise _",
    "@xmath0-ray blazar candidates that could be candidate counterparts of the corresponding uiss responsible for the hard x - ray emission detected by _",
    "we found that among the @xmath0-ray blazars selected according to our association procedure , 10 candidates out of 18 have at least one _ swift _  pointed observation .",
    "in addition , none of these @xmath0-ray blazar candidates has a @xmath0-ray counterpart in the 2fgl .",
    "we reduced and analyzed these _ swift _  observations to verify if these _ wise _",
    "@xmath0-ray blazar candidates have an optical - uv or soft x - ray counterpart . here",
    "we report the data reduction and analysis procedures used in our _ swift _  data analysis .",
    "the comparison between the _ swift _  and the _ wise _  images will be presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we followed the same uv - optical telescope ( uvot ) reduction procedure described in @xcite consequently , here we report only the basic details .",
    "several filter combinations are available for uvot observations ; however , we note that not all the optical and uv data are available for each source .",
    "the detection algorithm @xmath13 was used to confirm the presence of the optical - uv counterpart of the @xmath0-ray blazar candidates .",
    "we then performed the photometric analysis using the @xmath14 tool .",
    "counts were extracted from a 6@xmath15 radius aperture in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 filters and from a 12@xmath15 radius aperture for the other uv filters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) , to properly take into account the wider point spread function in these bandpasses .",
    "the count rate was corrected for coincidence loss , and the background subtraction was performed by estimating its level in an offset circular region at 20@xmath15 from the source .",
    "the correction for the interstellar reddening was obtained assuming the @xmath22 values from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the corrections described in cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , while the fluxes were derived with the same conversion factors given by giommi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) data reduction used in the following is also the same one described in @xcite ; here we only report the basic details .",
    "the xrt data analysis has been performed with the @xmath23 software ( v.  2.1 ) , developed at the asi science data center ( asdc ) and distributed within the heasoft package ( v.  6.10.0 ) .",
    "event files were calibrated and cleaned with standard filtering criteria using the xrtpipeline task , combined with the latest calibration files available in the _ swift _",
    "@xmath24 distributed by heasarc .",
    "only events in the energy range 0.310 kev with grades 012 were used . when more than a single _ swift _",
    "pointing of each source has been performed and is available within the _ swift _  archive , we combined several low s / n observations , because the the co - added x - ray image increases significantly the source detection .",
    "no signatures of pile - up were found in our xrt observations .    given the low exposure of the _ swift _",
    "observations it was not possible to carry out a detailed spectral analysis , so unless stated otherwise we used the detection algorithm @xmath25 , a tool of the @xmath26 package for all the _ swift _  observations .",
    "the @xmath25 algorithm locates the x - ray point sources using a sliding - cell method taking into account the average background intensity .",
    "the position and intensity of each detected source is calculated using a box whose size maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this detection algorithm has been extensively used in the swift serendipitous survey in deep xrt gamma - ray burst fields ( see also * ? ? ? * for additional details ) .",
    "statistical and systematic uncertainties on count rates are added quadratically .",
    "finally , we measured the net count rates for each detected soft x - ray source and we converted them into fluxes assuming a power - law spectrum with spectral index 1 and using webpimms .",
    "applying our new association procedure developed for the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources of _",
    "fermi_-lat  to the uiss , we found that 18 sources out of the 86 analyzed have a @xmath0-ray blazar candidate as possible counterparts .",
    "we note that this new association method proposed for the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources of _",
    "does not have the same efficiency when applied to soft @xmath0-rays and/or hard x - rays .",
    "in fact , in the _ fermi_-lat  energy range ( i.e. , 30 mev - 10 gev ) blazars are the largest known @xmath0-ray population @xcite , while the hard x - ray band is generally dominated by the emission of different classes of agn , such as seyfert galaxies , which constitute @xmath1 24% in comparison with the 2.4% for blazars already associated in the 4ic .",
    "this implies that the _ wise _",
    "@xmath0-ray blazar candidates are not necessarily the low - energy counterparts of the uiss .",
    "the relation between the ir spectral shape in the _ wise _  energy range and that in the @xmath0-rays is based on our association method ( e.g. , paper ii ) . on the other hand , in hard x - rays there is not yet evidence of a correlation between the ir and the x - ray emission of blazars , thus the eventual association between the _ wise _  @xmath0-ray blazar candidate and the uiss is less robust that in the case of the _",

    "this discrepancy is not sufficient to exclude the blazar association of the uiss because blazars exhibit rapid x - ray variability ; however , the it could suggest that the blazar is not the most probable low - energy counterpart for the uiss , in agreement with the fact that they are not the dominant class of agn in the hard x - rays .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-ray blazar candidates found with our method are _ wise _  sources , detected in all four _ wise _  bands , in particular at 22 @xmath2 m as the case of igrj14549@xmath316459 shown in figure  [ fig : igr14549_wise ] , for which the _ wise _  candidate counterpart appear to have the ir colors of blazars .",

    "we found that 18 out of 86 uiss analyzed clearly have a blazar counterpart within the _ searching regions _ , and for 10 of them also _ swift _  archival observations are available .",
    "however , for the latter 10 sources in _ swift _  we did not find a good agreement between the _ swift _  x - ray flux and the one estimated by the extrapolation of the _ integral _  spectrum .",
