    "the experimental ability to tune and control the quantum properties of matter has increased dramatically during the past decade .",
    "the evaporative cooling of bosons enabled the creation of bose - einstein condensates in dilute atomic gases  @xcite . due to statistics fermionic atoms proved harder to cool , but",
    "the favorable collisional properties of certain two - component mixtures made the efficient cooling of fermions into quantum degeneracy possible  @xcite .",
    "if two different kinds of fermions are mixed , they can interact via s - wave interactions .",
    "if this interaction is attractive , fermions can pair and form a superfluid as predicted by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the transition temperature of the superfluid transition is typically much smaller than degeneracy temperature of the fermions and therefore hard to reach experimentally .",
    "this difficulty was recently overcome by using the so - called feshbach resonance to change the strength of the interaction between two atoms .    near a feshbach resonance an external magnetic field  @xcite",
    "is used to tune the energy difference between the molecular bound state and the two - atom continuum .",
    "changes in this energy difference give rise to a resonant behavior of the interaction strength between two atoms .",
    "in particular , the interaction strength can be varied from a small and negative value ( bcs - side ) , into a very large value close to resonance , and finally into a small and positive value ( bec - side ) at the other side of the resonance . in the bose - einstein condensate side of the resonance the system forms diatomic molecules  @xcite and , at sufficiently low temperature , a condensate of molecules  @xcite .",
    "fermion pairing is possible on the bcs - side of the resonance .",
    "strong indications of such pairing were experimentally observed employing magnetic field sweeps across the resonance  @xcite and by monitoring the behavior of collective modes  @xcite . soon after the pairing gap was directly measured using radio - frequency spectroscopy  @xcite . finally , the smoking gun of superfluidity , a vortex lattice , in a fermionic system was very recently observed  @xcite .",
    "new tools to manipulate the atomic clouds have been developed .",
    "in particular , optical lattices have proved to be an especially useful tool . in the context of degenerate quantum gases , optical lattices  @xcite",
    "have been used to explore , for example , non - classical states , phase coherence , condensate dynamics , as well as matter wave interference . since both the lattice depth and the lattice geometry",
    "can be easily changed , there is the possibility of investigating experimentally anisotropic quantum systems as well as quantum phase transitions from , for example , a superfluid into an insulator as the tunneling strength between nearest neighbors is reduced  @xcite .",
    "also , sufficiently deep lattices in certain directions can be used to control the dimensionality of the system .    the ability to trap atoms into optical lattices",
    "does not depend on which statistics , fermionic or bosonic , the atoms obey .",
    "indeed , recently degenerate fermions have been studied experimentally in one - dimensional  @xcite as well as in three - dimensional  @xcite optical lattices .",
    "there has also been rapid progress on the theoretical front . among other things ,",
    "there are several studies on fermions and boson - fermion mixtures in optical lattices  @xcite and on fermion dynamics in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "in addition , more exotic fermionic systems with several flavors have been discussed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the density response of superfluid fermions in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattice , to elucidate how to investigate dimensional crossover effects .",
    "therefore we calculate the above signatures also for non - cubic optical lattices with varying lattice depths in different directions .",
    "we show that the speed of sound ( bogoliubov - anderson phonon ) as a function of filling fraction behaves qualitatively differently when the dimensionality of the lattice is changed .",
    "while we work consistently within the framework of the bcs theory , we expect our results and discussions to be instructive also somewhat closer to the feshbach resonance where interactions are stronger .",
    "naturally it is to be understood , that if the scattering length characterizing the interaction strength becomes comparable to the lattice spacing , the continuum feshbach physics will change  @xcite .",
    "if we furthermore have about one atom per lattice site , the simple bcs description is expected to fail in this case .",

    "this gives rise to a finite linewidth in the density response .    because the experimentally relevant lattice sizes are relatively small , only in the order of 100 sites per dimension , it is possible to explicitly calculate , i.e. without approximating by integrals , the sums over all lattice sites in the bcs - theory and the density response . for concreteness",
