    "[ bllac_lc ] shows examples of light curves of the lbl bl  lacertae , taken during a broadband observing campaign carried out in the second half of 2000 @xcite . while the radio emission of blazars is generally variable on time scales of weeks  months ( fig .",

    "* ) , which can be interpreted as the synchrotron radiation signature of gradual injection and/or acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons into the emitting region , and subsequent radiative cooling @xcite .    in lbls ,",
    "the soft x - ray emission is also sometimes dominated by the high - energy end of the synchrotron emission component , so similar spectral hysteresis phenomena should in principle be observable . however ,",
    "those objects are generally much fainter at x - ray energies than their high - frequency peaked counterparts , making the extraction of time - dependent spectral information an observationally very challenging task . fig .",
    "[ spectralvar ] clearly illustrates that the _ beppo_sax observations of bl  lacertae in 2000 revealed evidence for spectral variability , but lacked the sensitivity to clearly establish or rule out spectral hysteresis .",
    "such a measurement might require the new generation of x - ray telescopes such as _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton_.",
    "the high apparent bolometric luminosity combined with the short variability time scales and the apparent superluminal motions of individual jet components observed in many blazars , provide compelling evidence that the nonthermal continuum is produced in emission regions of a typical size scale of @xmath6  a few light days or less , moving relativistically along a jet structure which is directed at a small angle with respect to our line of sight .",
    "the jets are most likely powered by accretion of circumnuclear matter onto a supermassive black hole of @xmath8 .",
    "the emission regions are characterized by the presence of an ultrarelativistic population of nonthermal electrons .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed concerning the acceleration of such ultrarelativistic electrons , including impulsive injection near the base of the jet @xcite , individual shock waves propagating along the jet @xcite , relativistic particle acceleration at shear layers between a fast - moving inner jet and a slower moving outer jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or internal shocks from the collisions of multiple shells of material ejected into the jet structure @xcite .",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the time profile of injection and injected particle spectra of ultrarelativistic electrons are generally treated as free parameters in blazar modeling .",
    "the nonthermal electrons are emitting synchrotron radiation , which is responsible for the low - frequency emission from radio to uv or even x - ray frequencies .",
    "higher - frequency ( x - ray and @xmath0-ray ) emission is produced via compton scattering processes .",
    "possible target photon fields for compton scattering are the synchrotron photons produced within the jet ( the ssc process ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , or external photons ( the ec process ) .",
    "sources of external seed photons include the uv  soft x - ray emission from the disk  either entering the jet directly @xcite or after reprocessing in the broad line region ( blr ) or other circumnuclear material @xcite  , jet synchrotron radiation reflected at the blr @xcite , or the infrared emission from circumnuclear dust @xcite . in the context of jet model invoking a significant deceleration of the outflow along the jet , an important source of soft photons might also be provided by the synchrotron photons from slower portions of the jet further downstream @xcite .",
    "in addition to these fundamental radiation processes , @xmath9 absorption and pair production as well as synchrotron self absorption have to be taken into account in order to build a self - consistent blazar radiation model .",

    "the evolution of the photon population in the emission region has to be solved simultaneously with the electron distribution , and is determined through    @xmath17 @xmath18 where now @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe the fundamental emission and absorption processes , @xmath21 and @xmath22 describe the scattering rates into and out of a given photon energy bin , and @xmath23 is the photon escape time scale .      various versions of the generic leptonic jet model described in the previous section have been used very successfully to model simultaneous broadband spectra of several fsrqs , lbls , and hbls . as more detailed spectral information has become available , the results of such broadband spectral modeling have now converged towards a rather consistent picture @xcite .",
    "the spectral sequence hbls @xmath24 lbls @xmath24 fsrqs appears to be related to an increasing contribution of the external comptonization mechanism to the @xmath0-ray spectrum . while most fsrqs are successfully modelled with external comptonization models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "bl  lacertae , a lbl , appears to be intermediate between these two extremes , requiring an external comptonization component to explain the egret spectrum @xcite .",
    "one generally finds that hbls require higher average electron energies and lower magnetic fields than lbls and fsrqs . in most cases ,",
    "the required doppler boosting factors @xmath25 seem to be comparable for all types of objects , although there have also been some results indicating an extraordinarily high value of @xmath26 for the hbl mrk  501 @xcite .",
    "typical examples of broadband spectral fits consistent with this sequence of leptonic jet model parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ bbspectra ] .",
    "the occasional finding of very high doppler factors , in particular in some hbls , has prompted @xcite to propose their model of a decelerating , stratified jet in which synchrotron photons from slower regions of the jet would serve as seed photons for compton scattering , appearing slightly blue shifted in the rest frame of the faster high - energy emission region further upstream .",
    "such a scenario could remove the need for bulk lorentz factors largely in excess of @xmath4 for hbls .",
    "the generic blazar model described above is inherently time - dependent and facilitates the modeling not only of the broadband seds , but also the detailed spectral variability of blazars .",
    "studies of blazar spectral variability have been done in great detail for the case of pure ssc models with electron cooling dominated by synchrotron losses , e.g. , by @xcite . in those papers ,",
    "the spectral hysteresis observed in several hbls was reproduced , significantly constraining model parameters beyond constraints obtainable from pure spectral modeling .",
    "more recently , @xcite have extended these studies to an inhomogeneous jet model , also including an external compton component , so that the model would now also be applicable to lbls and quasars .",
    "they have applied their model to the special case of 3c  279 . based on their results",
    ", they interpreted the lack of a measurable time lag between the @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission in that object @xcite as evidence that x - rays and @xmath0-rays might be produced co - spatially by electrons of similar energies .",
    "this , in turn , provides evidence for two separate emission components being dominant at x - rays and @xmath0-rays .",
    "most plausibly , this might indicate that the x - ray emission is dominated by ssc emission , while the @xmath0-rays are dominated by external compton emission .",
    "time - dependent , homogeneous leptonic jet models in which radiation mechanisms other than synchrotron may dominate have recently been investigated in an analytical approach by @xcite , and with detailed numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a dominant contribution from ssc to the electron cooling will produce a characteristic time - averaged synchrotron spectral index of @xmath27 ( energy spectral index ) , independent of the injection index of relativistic electrons in the jet . in this case , the cooling time scale of electrons radiating at a synchrotron photon energy @xmath28 is expected to scale as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the electron injection spectral index @xcite .",
    "this differs characteristically from the synchrotron or ec dominated case in which @xmath31 , independent of the electron injection index @xmath30 .",
    "detailed numerical simulations of the time - dependent emission characteristics of homogeneous jet models with parameters specifically chosen to be appropriate for low - frequency peaked and intermediate bl  lac objects have been done by @xcite . a key result of their study was that a dominant ssc component would leave very obvious imprints in the x - ray spectral variability of these objects , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bc02_hid ] .",
    "in contrast , they found that a moderate and even slightly dominant contribution from external compton scattering will have virtually no effect on the x - ray spectral variability patterns .",
    "this might be a consequence of the fact that the beaming pattern of external commpton emission is more strongly peaked in the forward direction than the synchrotron and ssc components ( which are assumed to be isotropic in the co - moving frame of the emission region ) .",
    "thus , even if the ec component is dominating the @xmath0-ray emission at mev ",
    "gev energies , it may only make a moderate contribution to the electron cooling rate .",
    "the results of @xcite have been applied in detail to simultaneous multiwavelength observations of w  comae in 1998 @xcite and bl  lacertae in 2000 @xcite .",
    "while leptonic models deal with a relativistic e@xmath32 plasma in the jet , in hadronic models the relativistic jet consists of a relativistic proton ( @xmath33 ) and electron ( @xmath34 ) component . in the following ,",
    "a brief summary of the synchrotron - proton blazar ( spb- ) model @xcite is given , as an example of a hadronic model that takes into account all the salient features of hadronic blazar jet models in general .",
    "like in the leptonic model , the emission region in an agn jet moves relativistically along the jet axis which is closely aligned with our line of sight .",
    "relativistic protons , whose particle density @xmath35 follows a power law spectrum @xmath36 in the range @xmath37 , are injected instantaneously into a highly magnetized environment ( @xmath38  const . within the emission region ) , and are subject to energy losses due to proton - photon interactions ( meson production and bethe - heitler pair production ) , synchrotron radiation and adiabatic expansion .",
    "the mesons produced in photonmeson interactions always decay in astrophysical environments .",
    "however , they may suffer synchrotron losses before the decay , which is taken into account in this model .",
    "if the relativistic electrons are accelerated together with the protons at the same site , their injection spectrum shows most likely the same spectral shape @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the relativistic primary @xmath41 radiate synchrotron photons which constitute the low - energy bump in the blazar sed , and serve as the target radiation field for proton - photon interactions and the pair - synchrotron cascade which subsequently develops .",
    "the spb - model is designed for objects with a negligible external target photon component , and hence suitable for bl  lac objects .",
    "the cascade redistributes the photon power to lower energies where the photons eventually escape from the emission region .",
    "the cascades can be initiated by photons from @xmath42-decay ( `` @xmath42 cascade '' ) , electrons from the @xmath43 decay ( `` @xmath44 cascade '' ) , @xmath33-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath33-synchrotron cascade '' ) , charged @xmath45- , @xmath46- and @xmath47-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath48-synchrotron cascade '' ) and @xmath49 from proton - photon bethe - heitler pair production ( `` bethe - heitler cascade '' ) .    because `` @xmath42 cascades '' and `` @xmath44 cascades '' generate rather featureless photon spectra @xcite , proton and muon synchrotron radiation and their reprocessed radiation turn out to be mainly responsible for the high energy photon output in blazars .",
    "the contribution from the bethe - heitler cascades is mostly negligible .",
    "the low energy component is dominanted by synchrotron radiation from the primary @xmath34 , with a small contribution of synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons ( produced by the @xmath33- and @xmath48-synchrotron cascade ) . a detailed description of the model itself , and",
    "its implementation as a ( time - independent ) monte - carlo code , has been given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this code has been used , e.g. , to generate the spectral fits presented in @xcite for bl  lacertae in 2000 ( see also fig . [ bllacfit_lept_had ] ) .",
    "both the leptonic and hadronic models described in the previous sections have been applied successfully to the data obtained during the multiwavelength observing campaign on bl  lacertae in 2000 @xcite .",
    "the best time - averaged spectral fits are shown in figs .",
    "[ bbspectra ] and [ bllacfit_lept_had ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the leptonic and hadronic model fits differ substantially in the following ways : ( a ) the overall jet power required in the hadronic models is @xmath50 orders of magnitude higher than for the leptonic models ( @xmath51  ergs  s@xmath52 vs. @xmath53  ergs  s@xmath52 ) ; ( b ) the magnetic fields in hadronic jet models are a factor of @xmath54 higher than for leptonic models ( @xmath55  40  g vs. @xmath50  g ) , and the bulk lorentz factor of the emission region is a factor of @xmath50 lower for the hadronic models ( @xmath56  9 vs. @xmath57 ) .    considering the time - averaged emission of bl  lacertae in 2000 , hadronic models predict a sustained level of multi - gev  tev emission which should be detectable with second - generation atmospheric cherenkov telescope systems like veritas , hess , or magic . in contrast , our leptonic model only predicts a peak flux exceeding the anticipated nominal magic sensitivity during short flares ; the accumulated fluence over observing time scales of several hours might not be sufficient for a significant detection .",

    "various generic flaring scenarios had been investigated and compared to the observed optical and x - ray spectral variability patterns ( see fig . [ spectralvar ] ) . specifically , we had investigated scenarios invoking a temporary increase in jet power , a flattening of the electron injection spectral index , an increasing high - energy cutoff @xmath59 of the electron injection spectrum , and various combination of these .",
    "other parameter fluctuations could be ruled out on the basis of general , analytical considerations , without detailed simulations .",
    "we found that the observed optical and x - ray spectral variability in bl  lacertae in 2000 can be reproduced through short - term fluctuations of only the electron injection spectral index , with all other parameters remaining unchanged .",
    "remarkably , our time - dependent fits indicated that an injection index larger than @xmath60 , even during the peak of an individual short - term flare , is required .",
    "if the injection of ultrarelativistic electrons into the emitting volume is caused by fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks , detailed numerical studies have shown that with fully developed turbulence in the downstream region , a unique asymptotic index of @xmath61  2.3 should be expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , recently @xcite have shown that fermi acceleration might lead to drastically steeper injection spectra if the turbulence is not fully developed . furthermore , depending on the orientation of the magnetic field at the shock front , an abrupt steepening of the injection spectra may result if the shock transits from a subluminal to a superluminal configuration . in this context , our leptonic fit results may indicate that such predominantly geometric effects , may be the cause of the rapid variability observed in bl  lacertae .",
    "our spectral - variability simulation predicted counter - clockwise spectral hysteresis at x - ray energies .",
    "such hysteresis was not predicted in the specific spb model fits presented in @xcite , but could not clearly be ruled out either .",
    "thus , sensitive spectral - hysteresis measurements of bl  lacertae could possibly serve as a test of our modeling results and a secondary diagnostic to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic models , though , by itself , it would not be sufficient as a model discriminant .",
    "@xcite had previously noted the discrepancy between the time - averaged optical and x - ray spectra @xcite which could not be joined smoothly by an absorbed power - law spectrum .",
    "they had considered several possibilities to explain this discrepancy , including additional particle populations , extreme klein - nishina effects on the electron cooling rates , and/or anomalies in the intergalactic absorption .",
    "our successful modeling of the observed time - dependent flux and hardness values at optical and x - ray frequencies in the framework of a leptonic model effectively removes the need for such additional assumptions and indicates that the time - averaging involved in compiling the detailed broadband spectral energy distribution may be the cause of this apparent discrepancy .",
