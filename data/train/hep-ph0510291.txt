    "there are various reasons to suspect that baryon number is not a good symmetry of nature : ( i ) first is that nonperturbative effects of the standard model lead to @xmath6 , while keeping @xmath7 @xcite ; ( ii ) understanding the origin of matter in the universe requires @xmath8 @xcite and ( iii ) many theories beyond the standard model lead to interactions that violate baryon number @xcite .",
    "if indeed such interactions are there , the important question is : can we observe them in experiments@xmath9 ?",
    "two interesting baryon nonconserving processes of experimental interest are : ( a ) proton decay e.g. @xmath10 etc @xcite and ( b ) @xmath11 oscillation @xcite . these two classes of processes probe two different selection rules for baryon nonconservation : @xmath7 for proton decay and @xmath12 for @xmath11 oscillation and indicate totally different directions for unification beyond the standard model .",
    "for example , observation of proton decay will point strongly towards a grand desert till about the scale of @xmath13 gev whereas @xmath11 oscillation will require new physics at an intermediate scale at or above the tev scale but much below the gut scale .    while proton decay goes very naturally with the idea of eventual grand unification of forces and matter ,",
    "recent discoveries of neutrino oscillations have made @xmath11 oscillation to be quite plausible theoretically if small neutrino masses are to be understood as a consequence of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as follows : seesaw mechanism implies majorana neutrinos implying the existence of @xmath14 interactions . in the domain of baryons , it implies the existence of @xmath11 oscillation as noted many years ago @xcite .",
    "an explicit model for @xmath11 oscillation was constructed in @xcite by implementing the seesaw mechanism within the framework of the pati - salam @xcite @xmath15 model , where quarks and leptons are unified .",
    "it was shown that this process is mediated by the exchange of diquark higgs bosons with an amplitude ( @xmath16 ) which scales like @xmath17 . in the nonsupersymmetric version without fine tuning ,",
    "one expects @xmath18 leading to @xmath19 .",
    "so only if @xmath20 tev , the @xmath21 is in the range of @xmath22 sec and is accessible to experiments . on the other hand , in generic seesaw models for neutrinos ,",
    "one expects @xmath23 gev depending on whether the third generation dirac mass for the neutrino is 1 - 100 gev .",
    "an important question therefore is whether in realistic seesaw models , @xmath11 oscillation is at all observable .",
    "another objection to the above nonsupersymmetric model for @xmath24 that was raised in the 80 s was that such interactions will erase any baryon asymmetry created at high scales",
    ". it will be therefore important to overcome this objection .    in this note",
    "we point out that in a class of supersymmetric @xmath1 models ( called susy @xmath25 ) , an interesting combination of circumstances improves the @xmath26 dependence of the @xmath27 to @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 making @xmath11 oscillation observable .",
    "further more the same model also allows us to overcome the difficulty with high scale baryogenesis .",
    "an example of such a theory was presented in @xcite where it was shown that in the minimal version of the model , there exist accidental symmetries that imply that some of the @xmath30 s are in the tev range even though @xmath31 gev .",
    "we discuss this class of theories in this letter .",
    "the new results in this paper are : ( i ) a new diagram which enhances the @xmath11 oscillation amplitude ; ( ii ) a realistic example which is in agreement with the observed neutrino oscillation parameters while predicting observable @xmath11 oscillation amplitude and ( iii ) adequate leptogenesis mechanism @xcite for understanding the origin of matter via the quasi - degenerate leptogenesis @xcite with right - handed neutrinos at @xmath32 gev .    at present , the best lower bound on @xmath33 comes from ill reactor experiment @xcite and is @xmath34 sec .",
    "there are also comparable bounds from nucleon decay search experiments @xcite .",
    "there are proposals to improve the precision of this search by at least two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we feel that the results of this paper should give new impetus to a search for neutron - antineutron oscillation .",
    "the quarks and leptons in this model are unified and transform as @xmath35 representations of @xmath15 . for the higgs sector",
    ", we choose , @xmath36 and @xmath37 to give mass to the fermions .",
    "the @xmath38 to break the @xmath39 symmetry .",
    "the diquarks mentioned above which lead to @xmath40 processes are contained in the @xmath41 multiplet .",
    "we also add a @xmath39 neutral triplet @xmath42 which helps to reduce the number of light diquark states and a gauge singlet field @xmath43 .",
    "the superpotential of this model is given by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 note that since we do not have parity symmetry in the model , the yukawa couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not symmetric matrices .",
    "when @xmath48 , this superpotential has an accidental global symmetry much larger than the gauge group@xcite ; as a result , vacuum breaking of the @xmath39 symmetry leads to the existence of light diquark states that mediate @xmath49 oscillation and enhance the amplitude .",
    "in fact it was shown that for @xmath50 and @xmath51 and all vevs in the range of @xmath52 gev , the light states are those with quantum numbers : @xmath53 .",
    "the symmetry argument behind is that @xcite for @xmath48 , the above superpotential is invariant under @xmath54 symmetry which breaks down to @xmath55 when @xmath56 .",
    "this results in 21 complex massless states ; on the other hand these vevs also breaks the gauge symmetry down from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "this allows nine of the above states to pick up masses of order @xmath59 leaving 12 massless complex states which are the six @xmath60 plus six @xmath61 states .",
    "once @xmath62 , they pick up mass ( call @xmath63 ) of order of the elctroweak scale .",
    "to discuss @xmath11 oscillation , we introduce a new term in the superpotential of the form : @xmath64 where the @xmath65 etc stand for @xmath66 indices and we have suppressed the @xmath67 indices .",
    "we choose @xmath68 .",
    "this does not affect the masses of the higgs fields .",
    "when @xmath69 aquires a vev , @xmath70 interaction are induced from the superpotential , the contribution to neutron antineutron oscillation in this model comes from the diagram in fig .",
    "1 , which gives @xmath71 which scales like @xmath72 .",
    "there is also another pure higgs diagram that involves the vertex @xmath73 which also scales the same way and gives an identical contribution .",
    "this graph is the supersymmetric partner of fig .",
    "1 . note that for high scale seesaw models , these contributions to @xmath16 are considerably enhanced over that from the nonsupersymmetric theory@xcite which goes like @xmath29 .",
    "oscillation.,width=226 ]    in order to estimate the rate for @xmath11 oscillation , we need not only the different mass values for which we now have an order of magnitude , we also need the yukawa coupling @xmath74 .",
    "now @xmath74 is a small number since its value is associated with the lightest right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "however , in the calculation we need its value in the basis where quark masses are diagonal .",
    "we note that the @xmath75 diagrams involve only the right - handed quarks , the rotation matrix need not be the ckm matrix .",
    "the right - handed rotations need to be large e.g. in order to involve @xmath76 ( which is @xmath77 ) , we need @xmath78 to be large , where @xmath79 .",
    "the left - handed rotation matrices @xmath80 contribute to the ckm matrix , but right - handed rotation matrices @xmath81 are unphysical in the standard model . in this model , however , we get to see its contribution since we have a left - right gauge symmetry as we will see later .",
    "let us now estimate the time of oscillation .",
    "when we start on a @xmath82-diagonal basis ( call the diagonal matrix @xmath83 ) , the majorana coupling @xmath74 in the diagonal basis of up- and down - type quark matrices can be written as @xmath84 .",
    "now @xmath85 is @xmath77 and @xmath86 can be @xmath87 , so @xmath74 is about 0.4 in the diagonal basis of the quark matrices .",
    "we use @xmath88 , @xmath63 @xmath89 gev and @xmath0 gev . due to the presence of the colored field",
    "the couplings become non - perturbative very soon beyond the @xmath26 , we therefore take @xmath90 gev . the mass of @xmath91 i.e. @xmath92 is @xmath93 gev which is obtained from the vev of @xmath42 . putting all the above the numbers together ,",
    "we get @xmath94 . along with the hadronic matrix element@xcite , the @xmath75 oscillation time is found to be about @xmath95 sec which is within the reach of possible next generation measurements .",
    "we also note that as noted in @xcite the model is invariant under the hidden discrete symmetry under which a field @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the baryon number of the field @xmath98 . as a result , proton is absolutely stable in the model .",
    "since @xmath11 oscillation is a low intermediate scale phenomenon , it is necessary to see how it affects the baryogenesis discussion .",
    "one could of course invoke weak scale baryogenesis , which would remain unaffected since it happen at the weak scale .",
    "instead here we focus on leptogenesis mechanism for origin of matter .",
    "the obvious problem here is that if leptogenesis takes place at a scale where the @xmath100 process is in thermal equilibrium , then the matter - antimatter asymmetry generated will be erased .",
    "so two questions must be answered within our model : ( i ) what is the temperature @xmath101 below which the @xmath100 processes are out of equilibrium@xmath9 ? and",
    "( ii ) what constraints must be obeyed by the right - handed neutrino spectrum in the theory so that it will be possible to generate the lepton asymmetry below @xmath101 ? clearly , @xmath101 must be above the weak scale so that the sphalerons can be effective in converting leptons to baryons .    to answer the first question , we compare the @xmath100 reaction rate with the hubble expansion",
    ". the diquark higgs field @xmath60 remains at weak scale in the thermal bath , while @xmath102 etc decouple at high scale .",
    "the @xmath100 process surviving till lowest temperature is @xmath103 .",
    "the coupling of the interaction can be estimated as @xmath104",
    ". the out of equilibrium condition of this process would be : @xmath105 which gives @xmath106 gev .",
    "this implies that for leptogenesis to work , at least one right - handed neutrino should be lighter than @xmath107 gev .",
    "in fact in view of the low scale , we will need to invoke quasi - degenerate leptogenesis @xcite , in the case of thermal leptogenesis or one can also have the inflaton decaying into the two light right - handed neutrinos and the decay of the right - handed neutrinos would generate the required lepton asymmetry . in both these cases , the lighter right - handed neutrinos are almost degenerate to produce the correct amount of baryon asymmetry .",
    "below , we give an example of the heavy right - handed neutrino as well as the dirac neutrino mass texture as an example that leads to the correct neutrino mixings as well as a correct amount of baryons .",
    "we choose the majorana neutrino coupling to the @xmath108s as : @xmath109 where @xmath110 to have two right - handed neutrino around @xmath107 gev , where the heaviest neutrino mass is @xmath111 gev .",
    "the degeneracy has to be broken , however , since we need @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are masses and decay widths of right - handed neutrinos , respectively .",
    "thus , we need small perturbation in 11 and 22 elements .",
    "the formula for lepton asymmetry is : @xmath115 where the neutrino dirac yukawa coupling @xmath116 in this expression is given in the basis where the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "we choose the following dirac neutrino coupling ( which generates the correct neutrino masses using type i seesaw ) @xmath117 where we have omitted phases of order one .",
    "the asymmetry generated by this texture needs to be multiplied by the efficiency factor @xmath118 . for quasi degenerate right - handed neutrinos",
    ", one gets @xmath119 . as a result",
    ", there is an enhancement factor for the lepton asymmetry depending on the mass difference which is a parameter in this model .",
    "the decay parameter @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the decay width of the heavy majorana neutrino , is large ; for example , @xmath122 for above choice of @xmath123 and @xmath124 around @xmath107 gev , @xmath125 or smaller .",
    "our model has several interesting phenomenological consequences both for colliders and rare decays for up - type quarks .",
    "for instance , since our diquark higgs bosons and their superpartners have masses in the few hundred gev range , they should be produced at lhc , possibly at tevatron .",
    "the production can happen singly or in pairs via parton processes such as @xmath126 , @xmath127 etc .",
    "these new higgs boson and its superpartners can decay into to two charm , up quarks , top quarks should provide a good signal . at the lhc ,",
    "the signal from a pair production may contain the following final states : 4 charm quarks , 2 top-2 charm quarks , 4 top quarks etc .",
    "the fermionic partner of these diquark higgs , however , would produce missing energy in the final states . the single production will produce a change in the top quark pair production .",
    "a detailed study is underway .",
    "a second interesting consequence is that in the mass eigenstate basis for quarks , the light @xmath128 will mediate flavor changing processes such as @xmath129 , @xmath130 etc .",
    "the present bounds on charm changing processes is consistent with the value of the diquark higgs boson mass that has been used in the paper .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a quark - lepton unified model where despite the high seesaw ( @xmath26 ) scale in the range of @xmath131 gev , the @xmath75 oscillation time is around @xmath132 sec . due to the presence of a new supersymmetric graph and accidental symmetries of the higgs potential ( also connected to supersymmetry ) .",
    "no unatural fine tuning of diquark masses is needed to get such an enhanced effect .",
    "our predicted oscillation time is within the reach of possible future experiments .",
    "we believe that this work should provide a new motivation to conduct a new round of search for @xmath75 oscillation . to show that this is a completely realistic model , we note that ( i ) the proton is absolutely stable in this model ; ( ii ) the model can provide a realistic description of known quark and lepton physics as well as ( iii ) a way to generate an adequate lepton asymmetry via the mechanism of quasi - degenerate leptogenesis .",
