    "no symmetry principle is known in physics which may guarantee the conservation of baryon ( b)- or lepton ( l)-number . nevertheless , there are two important observations which are relevant to b and l non - conservation in a very profound way : namely baryogenesis  @xcite , and the realization that b and l are not strictly conserved in the standard model of electroweak interactions  @xcite .    in the standard hot big bang model  @xcite ,",
    "one of the most obvious relics from the early universe is the baryon .",
    "but the universe , at some distance scale around us , @xmath51 , is practically 100  % charge asymmetric , with baryon number density very much exceeding that of antibaryons , @xmath52 ( and @xmath53 .",
    "the distance @xmath51 is at least of the size of our visible universe .",
    "the standard electroweak theory contains in principle all the elements necessary for the generation of the baryonic asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical elements are    \\(i ) anomalous electroweak baryon - number non - conservation  @xcite ,    \\(ii ) c- and cp - violation in the fundamental gauge and higgs interactions of the quarks ,    \\(iii ) deviation from thermal equilibrium , assuming the cosmological electroweak phase transition is first order  @xcite , which occurs at temperatures of about @xmath54 .",
    "this scenario was explicitly realized with the advent of the grand unified theory ( gut ) , which predicts b and possibly cp violations , mediated by very heavy gauge bosons , x and y. the gut baryogenesis is appealingly simple but does not easily fit into an acceptable cosmology . ]    at low temperatures , this anomalous electroweak b violation is negligible  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the proton lifetime , determined from the absence of the decay @xmath55 was found to be larger than @xmath56 years at 90  % confidence level  @xcite . on the other hand , at the @xmath5 resonance with an equivalent temperature of 90 @xmath57 , the decays @xmath58 may conceivably occur at an observable level due to the anomalous interactions mentioned above .    in this paper , we present the results of a search for the decays @xmath59 and their charge conjugate final - states , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with the opal detector at lep .",
    "these decays would violate b , l and the fermion number , n = ( b+l ) while conserving ( b  l ) .",
    "we have searched for events characterized by a pair of back - to - back charged particles , where one is identified as a lepton and the other as a proton .",
    "although other rare decay modes of the @xmath5 can also be handled in the same analysis , they are not discussed here since they either violate conservation laws attributable to some fundamental symmetries , or since stringent constraints on their rates have already been set by opal and other lep experiments  @xcite .",
    "a complete description of the opal detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and only those components most relevant to the identification of high energy electrons , muons and protons are described briefly here .",
    "the central detector provides charged particle tracking over 96% of the full solid angle in a 0.435  t uniform magnetic field parallel to the beam axis  .",
    "it consists of a two - layer silicon microstrip vertex detector , a high precision drift chamber , a large volume jet chamber , and a set of @xmath62 chambers measuring the track coordinates along the beam direction .",
    "the sensitive volume of the jet chamber is a cylinder of about 2 m in radius and 4 m in length .",
    "it is divided into 24 sectors , each equipped with 159 sense wires and two cathode wire planes . up to 159 measurements of position and charge deposition per track",
    "are possible .",
    "the momentum resolution of the whole tracking system is @xmath63/@xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath64 is the momentum component transverse to the beam direction .",
    "the charge measurements were used for the calculation of the specific energy loss @xmath66of a track .",
    "the @xmath66resolutions obtained with a number of samplings @xmath67 are @xmath68 and @xmath69 for muons in @xmath70 and for minimum ionising pions within jets , respectively  @xcite . a detailed description of the main features of the jet chamber can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic coil is surrounded by a time - of - flight counter array ( tof ) which measures the time - of - flight for a charged particle from the interaction region with a time resolution of about 300 ps and can be used for the rejection of cosmic ray muons . a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) , located outside the magnet coil , covers the full azimuthal range with excellent hermeticity in the polar angle range of @xmath71 . in the barrel region ( @xmath72 ) , the ecal is composed of 9440 lead - glass blocks , each 37 cm in depth .",
    "the blocks are approximately @xmath73 in cross section , and the calorimeter is typically 24.6 radiation lengths deep .",
    "the energy resolution of the barrel ecal is approximately @xmath74 for 45 @xmath75 electrons .",
    "the magnet return yoke is segmented and instrumented for hadron calorimetry ( hcal ) and consists of barrel and endcap sections along with pole tip detectors that together cover the region @xmath76 .",
    "the hcal provides tracking for muons above @xmath77 and sampling for the showers produced by hadrons interacting with material ( a total of @xmath78 8 absorption lengths to the back of hcal in the barrel region ) inside the lead glass of ecal and the return yoke of hcal .",
    "four layers of muon chambers cover the outside of the hadron calorimeter .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeters close to the beam axis complete the geometrical acceptance down to 24 mrad in @xmath79 , except for the regions where a tungsten shield is present to protect the detectors from synchrotron radiation .",
    "these are lead - scintillator sandwich calorimeters and , at smaller angles , silicon tungsten calorimeters  @xcite located on both sides of the interaction point and used for luminosity measurement .",
    "the data used for this analysis were recorded at lep during 1990  1994 .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the data sample is 119 @xmath80  @xcite corresponding to 5.2 million @xmath5 decays .",
    "the simulation of @xmath81 decays and their charge conjugate final - states begins with 20,000 @xmath70 events that were generated at the @xmath5 resonance peak with @xmath82 using the koralz  @xcite monte carlo .",
    "the masses , particle types and the four momenta vectors of the muon pairs were then changed into those of @xmath83 or @xmath84 pairs with equal probability and the necessary corrections were made to preserve momentum and energy conservation .",
    "responses of the opal detector to these particles were then obtained by processing the four vectors through the opal monte carlo simulation chain  @xcite .",
    "the analysis procedure consists of the selection of a pair of collinear charged particles in the barrel region of the jet chamber , each with approximately the beam energy , followed by particle identification .",
    "major backgrounds were anticipated from mis - identification of the high energy charged leptons in @xmath85 and @xmath86 decays .",
    "large samples of standard model lepton pairs ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) were generated with the koralz and babamc  @xcite monte carlo programs .",
    "in addition , 1.3 million standard model @xmath5 decays into @xmath89 s , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 quarks , were also generated with the jetset  @xcite monte carlo program .",
    "all events are then processed through the opal analysis chain  @xcite .",
    "in this analysis , candidate events were chosen from a sample of low ( charge ) multiplicity events .",
    "we demanded that the events contained two , and only two , well  measured high energy tracks , satisfying the following preselection criteria to guarantee a high degree of redundancy in triggering and to give almost an 100 % trigger efficiency for the detection of the signal  @xcite :    @xmath92 well  measured tracks were defined by :    the distance of closest approach to the beam axis in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis must be less than 2 cm .",
    "the distance to the interaction point along the beam axis , at the point of closest approach in the plane transverse to the beam axis , must be less than 40 cm .",
    "the @xmath93 of the track fit in the @xmath94 plane must be less than 2 .    the first sense wire in the jet chamber used for track fitting must lie within a radius of 75 cm from the colliding beam axis",
    ".    there must be at least 100 hits used for the ionization energy loss , @xmath66 , measurement and 4 hits in the @xmath62 chambers .",
    "the track polar angle must satisfy @xmath95 .",
    "the track must have either its measured @xmath96 , or its associated @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath92 to select the required event topology , the two tracks were required to be :    oppositely charged and collinear within @xmath98 ,    in coincidence at the tof counters , where we demanded that : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the measured time - of - flights and polar angles of the two preselected particles respectively .    at this stage",
    "@xmath102 events passed the event preselection criteria .",
    "possible contamination from two photon interactions were efficiently removed by the high @xmath103 and @xmath104 cuts .",
    "cosmic muons passing through the interaction region were rejected by the coincidence requirement on their tof measurements .",
    "the surviving events , consistent with the number expected from standard model @xmath105 decays to @xmath106 and @xmath86 , constituted the major background to the signal .",
    "comparisons of the data with these standard model monte carlo simulated @xmath5 decay backgrounds are shown in row 3 of table  [ tab : tab1 ] for the numbers of events that survived preselection , and in figures 1 and 2 for the @xmath107 and @xmath66 distributions of the charged tracks , respectively .",
    "the monte carlo simulated background reproduced the data very well .",
    "we demanded , among the two pre - selected high energy particles in each event , that there be one identified charged lepton and one charged track identified as a proton and not as a lepton .",
    "particle identification was achieved using five independent quantities , namely momentum ( @xmath108 ) , ionization energy loss ( @xmath66 ) , energy deposits in the calorimeters , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and the information on matching of muon chamber hits to the charged track .",
    "we defined a ` tracking road ' along the direction of each charged track in the opal calorimeters with a width : @xmath111 @xmath112    @xmath92 electron identification :    electron candidates were defined as those tracks having @xmath113 with @xmath114 , and no hits found in the ` tracking road ' , except for the first layer of the hcal .",
    "@xmath92 muon identification :    as muon candidates we considered those tracks which failed the electron identification .",
    "those tracks must have its measured momentum , @xmath108 , satisfying @xmath115 , and have more than 4 hits along the ` tracking road ' . to distinguish muons from protons",
    ", we further demanded that either at least two of the hits on the ` tracking road ' be in the muon chamber , or there be at least 4 of the hits in the hcal with no more than one hit per layer , or that there be at least 2 of the hits in the 3 outermost layers of the hcal .",
    "@xmath92 proton identification :    we considered those tracks as proton candidates which failed the electron identification . the proton track must have @xmath115 and have at least one hit found in hcal with the expected total calorimeter energy associated with the measured track @xmath116 but requiring that @xmath117 .    @xmath92 event identification :    finally , events identified as @xmath118 or @xmath119 pairs were removed , while event to be identified as a signal must satisfy the @xmath66requirement defined below :    @xmath92 @xmath66requirement :    the proton must have a measured @xmath66@xmath120 9 @xmath121(see figure 2 ) . for the accompanied @xmath122 or @xmath123 , the measured @xmath66must agree with its expected value for the particle assignment and the measured momentum .",
    "no events in the data sample survived the selection criteria , while 1.2 background events were expected from the standard model background processes .",
    "to estimate the detection efficiency of the signal and to investigate possible bias in the selection of events , preselection and particle identification criteria were applied to reconstructed monte carlo signal events .",
    "the shaded histogram in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , with arbitrary normalization , shows the distribution of the expected total calorimeter energy , @xmath124 , associated with each of the measured tracks of pre - selected monte carlo simulated signal events .",
    "the low energy peak centered at 3 @xmath57 comes from the muons , while the peak centered at the beam energy ( 45 @xmath57 ) comes from the electrons .",
    "the broad peak in the middle of the spectrum comes from the protons  @xcite .",
    "no such central region broad peak is seen either in the data ( points ) or in the monte carlo simulated background ( open histogram ) events as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the preselection criteria limited the acceptance of the signal to the barrel region of the opal detector where the jet chamber provided a large number of hits for each of the pre - selected charged tracks for the @xmath66and momentum measurements .",
    "these criteria ensured a better than 5.3 % resolution in momentum and a 3.5 % resolution on @xmath66for a @xmath125 charged particle . as a result",
    ", 3@xmath126 separation between protons and muons , and 4@xmath126 separation between protons and electrons at @xmath127 were achieved  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66distribution of the pre - selected data is compared to that of the monte carlo simulated background in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the shaded histogram shows the @xmath66distribution expected for 45 @xmath128 protons .",
    "a @xmath66@xmath129 @xmath121cut was used for the identification of protons .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] summarizes the event flow history .",
    "the equivalent integrated luminosities of the monte carlo generated background sample sizes are shown in row 1 .",
    "row 2 shows the numbers of these events , normalized to the recorded luminosity ( @xmath130 ) , surviving the requirements of low ( charge ) multiplicity . in row 3 , the numbers of monte carlo simulated events and data events surviving the preselection are compared .",
    "the agreement here is excellent .",
    "not shown in the table are the corresponding numbers for the standard model monte carlo simulated multi - hadronic decays of the @xmath5 , because we found that none of the 1.3 million monte carlo simulated @xmath131 events survived the preselection criteria .",
    "in addition , six million standard model @xmath5 decays were generated with jetset  @xcite and subjected to a preselection at the four - vector level .",
    "we found no event other than the standard model @xmath132 or @xmath133 pairs that survived the preselection criteria . in table 1 ,",
    "row 4 shows that :    the pre - selected data were dominated by ( 97.4 % ) @xmath132 pairs .",
    "after preselection , the efficiency for the identification of @xmath118 was found to be 99.9 % , and 94.5 % for @xmath119 .",
    "after the identified @xmath118 and @xmath119 pairs were removed , none of the events in the data sample survived the @xmath66requirement selection , while 1.2 events were expected from the simulated background .",
    "the detection efficiencies of the signal events for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , were found to be : + @xmath136 and @xmath137 respectively .",
    "more details on particle identification for the pre - selected events are shown in table  [ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "the numbers of tracks surviving the preselection criteria are shown in row 1 .",
    "the numbers of electron and muon candidates identified in the data sample are compared to those of the monte carlo simulated backgrounds in rows 2 and 3 .",
    "proton candidates shown in row 4 are due to the mis - identification of ( @xmath78 0.5 % ) the pre - selected charged leptons before imposing the final @xmath66requirement .",
    "this was anticipated because :    @xmath138 a high energy muon or electron can sometimes deposit a great deal of its energy inside the calorimeters due to bremsstrahlung , @xmath118 pair production , or deep inelastic nuclear interaction ( dis ) .",
    "these processes are characterized by large uncertainties , small cross sections , hard spectra , and large energy fluctuations in the generation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers ,    @xmath138 a high energy lepton can undergo dis in the ecal , where only the electromagnetic component of the shower is measured by the lead glass , resulting in @xmath139 ,    @xmath138 hadrons are emitted in @xmath140 decays .",
    "these effects , in particular the dis of the @xmath122 s and @xmath123 s , made the proton identification , with @xmath124 cuts alone , difficult .",
    "however , after removing the identified @xmath118 and @xmath119 pairs , the final @xmath66requirement efficiently eliminated every one of the 1249 identified proton candidates in the data .",
    "the 1.2 background events , all identified as @xmath141 , consisted of 0.5 events coming from @xmath119 and 0.7 events from @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath119 background events can be understood as dis of one of the high energy muons , while the @xmath133 background events are due to mis - identification of @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "allowing the @xmath66and @xmath124 cuts to vary , based on the analysis of the monte carlo simulated events , we estimated a 0.71 % systematic uncertainty for the detection of the signal .",
    "final - state radiation ( fsr ) is expected to be different for muons and electrons or protons .",
    "changing the particle code from @xmath123 to @xmath145 in the final - state of @xmath70 events ( see section 3 ) may have caused an underestimation of the fsr correction on the electrons in the @xmath146 events resulting in a larger than expected acceptance of the signal .",
    "based on a study of the @xmath147 events , we found that 0.47  % of the electrons could have a measured @xmath104 less than 35 @xmath57 .",
    "this value was quoted as the systematic uncertainty in the estimation of the detection efficiency due to fsr .",
    "another source of systematic error came from the 0.41  % uncertainty in the collected luminosity  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "a quadratic sum of all of the above mentioned errors yielded a 0.94  % systematic error on the detection efficiency , @xmath148 , and 0.81  % on @xmath149 .",
    "using a data sample of 5.2 million @xmath5 decays and with 0 candidate event found , we obtained the following upper limits : @xmath150 and @xmath151 at 95  % confidence level  @xcite .",
    "this is the first time that limits have been obtained on the partial widths of @xmath5 decays for processes which simultaneously violate baryon- , lepton- , and fermion - number conservation .",
    "the above limits are comparable to the existing limits on lepton family number violating @xmath5 decays  @xcite .",
    "we particularly wish to thank the sl division for the efficient operation of the lep accelerator at all energies and for their continuing close cooperation with our experimental group .",
    "we thank our colleagues from cea , dapnia / spp , ce - saclay for their efforts over the years on the time - of - flight and trigger systems which we continue to use .",
