    "in the past few years conclusive evidence that low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxrbs ) contain fast spinning , weakly magnetic neutron stars has been gathered .",
    "coherent periodicities have been discovered in four sources sax j1808.43654 ( 401 hz , wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) , xte j1751305 ( 435 hz , markwardt et al .",
    "2002 ) , xte j0929314 ( 185 hz , galloway et al . 2002 ) and recently xte j1807294 ( 191 hz , markwardt , smith & swank 2003 ) .",
    "all these four sources are transients , i.e. exhibit only sporadic activity and for most of the time remain in a state of low level activity ( for a review see e.g. campana et al .",
    "these transient pulsars share many similarities among them , but are rather peculiar among transient sources containing a neutron star ( usually named soft x ",
    "ray transients , sxrt ) . their peak x ",
    "ray luminosities are rather faint ( @xmath2 ) , whereas sxrts have peak luminosities of @xmath3 .",
    "they show x  ray pulsations , whereas for sxrts and lmxrbs tight upper limits exist ( e.g. vaughan et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the discovery of x  ray pulsation during the outburst phase has also allowed to reveal an orbital periodicity , which in all cases is shorted than @xmath4 hr ( 2.01 hr for sax j1808.43654 , chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ; 42.4 min for xte j1751305 markwardt et al .",
    "2002 ; 43.6 min for xte j0929314 galloway et al . 2002 ; 40.1 min for xte j1807294 , markwardt , juda & swank 2003 ) .",
    "these periods are much shorter than what usually found in sxrts ( @xmath5 hr ) .",
    "these differences led some authors to suggest that transient pulsars might form a separate ( sub-)class among sxrts , called faint transients ( heise et al .",
    "1998 ; king 2000 ; int zand 2001 ) .",
    "faint transients are poorly known .",
    "the best studied source is sax j1808.43658 .",
    "it was studied across three outbursts ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ) , in quiescence ( campana et al . 2002 ) , in the optical ( homer et al . 2001 ) and radio ( gaensler et al .",
    "1999 ) bands .",
    "concerning xte j1807294 very little is known .",
    "the source was discovered during a galactic plane scan by rxte / pca ( markwardt , smith & swank 2003 ) .",
    "the source was observed at a level of 33 , 38 , 58 , 41 and 20 mcrab ( 210 kev ) on 2003 feb 16.7 , 19.8 , 21.6 , 22.6 and mar 13.9 , respectively . a follow - up chandra observation on 2003",
    "mar 10.8 allowed to obtain a much better position ( @xmath6 uncertainty ) .",
    "pulsations were still detectable and allowed a refined orbital solution to be obtained from rxte data ( markwardt , juda & swank 2003 ) .    here",
    "we report on an xmm - newton ( discretionary time ) too observation of xte j1807294 on 2003 mar 22 ( see also campana et al .",
    "2003 ) . in section 2",
    "we describe the observational data and the reduction strategy . in section 3",
    "we describe our results on spectral and timing analysis .",
    "conclusions are reported in section 4 .",
    "the xmm - newton observatory ( jansen et al . 2001 ) includes three 1500 @xmath7 x  ray telescopes each with a european photon imaging camera ( epic , 0.115 kev ) at the focus .",
    "two of the epic imaging spectrometers use mos ccds ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) and one uses pn ccds ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) . reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs , 0.352.5 kev , den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) are located behind two of the telescopes .",
    "xte j1807294 was observed on march 22 , 2003 from 13:57 to 18:40 .",
    "mos1 was operating in small window mode , mos2 in prime full window mode and pn in timing mode , all with thick filters .",
    "rgs1 and rgs2 were operating in the spectro + q standard mode . due to a problem in the field acquisition",
    "the source was originally pointed 1 arcmin apart .",
    "this problem was then corrected , resulting in an overall efficiency decrease of the pn , mos1 and rgs instruments .",
    "we generated final product using sas v. 5.4.1 .",
    "a small soft proton flare event occurred at the beginning of the observation , we excluded the first 2.5 ks from the analysis .",
    "we obtained net exposure times of 14 ks and 9 ks for mos2 and the other instruments , respectively .",
    "the source is extremely bright such that the mos cameras are saturated and the radial support structure of the mirrors is visible .",
    "piled - up rate for the mos2 camera is @xmath8 counts s@xmath9 ( 0.510 kev ) .",
    "source position is consistent with that determined with chandra ( markwardt , juda & swank 2003 ) .",
    "a simple way round to pile - up is to extract photons for spectral analysis in an annulus around the source , thus excluding the inner ( piled - up ) core .",
    "we followed this strategy for analysing the mos2 data , whereas for mos1 data the window is too small ( see also the analysis carried out on mkn 421 , presenting similar problems , by ravasio et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "we extracted photons from an annulus of @xmath10 and @xmath11 inner and outer radii , respectively .",
    "background was extracted from two different outer circular regions @xmath12 each .",
    "we selected only single - pixel events and make sure that no pile - up is present ( through the sas tool epatplot ) .",
    "this is also in line with prescriptions by molendi & sembay ( 2003 ) .",
    "the count rate within the 0.510 kev energy band is @xmath13 counts s@xmath9 .",
    "response matrix and ancillary files were then generated with rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "spectral data were rebinned to have 80 counts per bin .",
    "timing mode was selected to have the opportunity to reveal x  ray pulsations .",
    "given the high count rate of the source , this mode is particularly useful to avoid any pile - up .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum from the raw image , taking a column 10-pixel wide and the background from two separate boxes 5-pixels wide .",
    "we consider only `` single '' and `` double '' events .",
    "no x  ray bursts were detected .",
    "the source count rate in the 0.510 kev band is @xmath14 counts s@xmath9 .",
    "background is at a level of @xmath15 in the full band .",
    "pile - up is negligible and dead time is at a level of @xmath16 .",
    "response matrix and ancillary file for spectral analysis were generated using sas tasks .",
    "spectral data were rebinned to have 80 counts per bin .",
    "the standard sas procedure rgsproc was used to derive the first order rgs spectra . in the 736   band rates",
    "are @xmath17 and @xmath18 count s@xmath9 for rgs1 and rgs2 , respectively . for spectral analysis together with the other instruments we rebinned the data to 100 counts per bin .",
    "we further inspect the rgs spectra for emission or absorption lines . in this case",
    "we rebin the spectra to 20 counts per bin ( see below ) .",
    "the spectral analysis has been carried out in the 0.510 kev energy range for mos2 and pn and in 736   for the two rgss , using xspec ( v11.2 ) .",
    "all spectral uncertainties are given at @xmath19 confidence level for one degree of freedom ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we first tried the standard model for sxrts , i.e. an absorbed soft component ( black body ) plus a hard component ( power law ; e.g. campana et al .",
    "the fit is good with a @xmath21 ( 1571 degrees of freedom , d.o.f . ) .",
    "fit parameters can be found in table [ spetab ] .",
    "the column density is @xmath22 which is slightly higher than the galactic value of @xmath23 .",
    "a comparable ( but more physical ) model is obtained by replacing the power law with a comptonization model like comptt ( titarchuk 1994 ) as observed in sax j1808.43658 ( gierlinski , done & barret 2002 but not in xte 1751305 , miller et al .",
    "in this case we obtain @xmath24 ( 1569 d.o.f . , see fig . [ spe ] ) .",
    "systematic errors at @xmath25 level provide an acceptable fit .",
    "the column density is @xmath26 , consistent with the galactic value .",
    "the black body temperature is @xmath27 kev and its radius ( assuming spherical symmetry ) is @xmath28 km ( with @xmath29 the unknown distance to xte j1807294 in units of 8 kpc and @xmath30 the spectral hardening factor obtained as the ratio of the color temperature to the effective temperature , e.g. merloni , fabian & ross 2000 ) .",
    "the temperature of the soft input photon is @xmath31 kev . in the comptonization model",
    "the temperature of the corona and the plasma optical depth are tightly related .",
    "the best fit is for a relatively cool corona ( @xmath32 kev , i.e. @xmath33 kev ) and an optical depth ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "a very hot corona ( @xmath35 kev ) with a negligible optical depth ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 at @xmath19 confidence level , c.l . ) is also ( formally ) acceptable .",
    "however , with a detector sensitive up to 10 kev , it is impossible to test the presence of such a high coronal temperature . the unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux for our best fit spectrum amounts to @xmath38 .",
    "source luminosity is @xmath39 .",
    "the extrapolated luminosity to the 0.01100 kev band is a factor @xmath40 larger .",
    "the hard component contributes almost the entire ( unabsorbed ) flux ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the black body component is detectable only at low energies .",
    "other soft components have been tried with similarly good results .",
    "we can not discriminate between an emission from a black body or from an accretion disk ( @xmath42 kev , @xmath43 km ) . a neutron star atmosphere ( gnsicke , braje & romani 2002 ) and a thermal spectrum however provided a worse fit to the data .",
    "we searched for an iron lines in the pn and mos data with negative results .",
    "taking the line energy in 6.406.97 kev and 0.1 kev ( best fit ) or null values for the line width , we derive an upper limit on the equivalent width of 18 and 25 ev , respectively .    following miller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we searched the rgs spectra for emission or absorption lines .",
    "we divided the spectra ( rebinned at 20 counts per bin ) in slices of 3   and inspect them for lines in the energy band 720  .",
    "we fitted the sliced spectra with an absorbed ( vartbabs , wilms , allen & mccray 2000 ) power law model .",
    "all fits are acceptable . no emission or absorption lines are found .",
    "we directly searched for ne k edge line at 14.25   following the evidence for enhanced absorption in ultra - compact binaries ( schulz et al .",
    "2001 ; juett , psaltis & chakrabarty 2001 ) .",
    "no ne edge is visible and the fit procedure is not sensible to its presence .",
    "we also searched for ne ly@xmath44 line at 12.13   ( in the range 1113  ) .",
    "no line is present and an upper limit of 41 ev can be set ( @xmath45 c.l . ) . in case of a narrow line",
    "the limit is 9 ev .",
    "detected ne lines in 4u 162667 had equivalent witdhs of 20   ( schulz et al .",
    "we used the sas task barycen to correct the pn data .",
    "the time resolution is 29.56 @xmath46s ( kuster et al .",
    "a significant signal in the power spectrum is readily visible in the data ( campana et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , the power spectrum shows a large number of peaks likely resulting from aliasing of the short orbital period ( see fig .",
    "[ power ] ) .",
    "the correct pulse period can only be obtained after correcting for the orbital modulation .",
    "we assumed the orbital period derived by markwardt , juda & swank ( 2003 ) using rxte data , i.e. @xmath47 min , and searched for the projected orbital radius and time of @xmath48 mean longitude assuming the hypothesis of circular orbit . stepping on those two parameters and , for each case , folding the events into a 10-bin light curve .",
    "the presence of a modulation in the folded light curve was then estimated with a @xmath49 test .",
    "this is similar to the analysis carried out by kirsch & kendziorra ( 2003 ) .",
    "we successfully recover the pulsation with a projected orbital radius @xmath50 and an epoch of @xmath48 mean longitude @xmath51 ( @xmath19 c.l .",
    ", see fig .",
    "[ contour ] ) .",
    "pulsations were detected at 5.2459426(2 ) ms ( @xmath19 c.l . ) .",
    "after correction for the orbital motion and in the full band used for timing analysis ( 0.310 kev ) the ( background subtracted ) pulsed fraction amounts to @xmath52 ( @xmath19 c.l .",
    ", without correction the pulsed fraction is only @xmath53 ) .",
    "the fit is not completely satisfactory ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "an additional sinusoidal component at half of the spin period is highly significant ( f - test probability @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "the pulsed fraction of xte j1807289 is comparable to what observed in sax j1808.43658 ( @xmath57 , wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) , xte 1751305 ( @xmath57 , markwardt et al .",
    "2002 ) and xte j0929314 ( @xmath58 , galloway et al .",
    "the pulsed fraction increases with energy , going from @xmath59 in 0.32 kev to @xmath60 in 25 kev and to @xmath61 in 510 kev .",
    "also for these curves two sinusoidal components provide a much better fit .",
    "the orbital modulation is not directly visible in the data . folding the barycentered pn light curve at the orbital period reported by markwardt , juda & swank ( 2003 )",
    ", we can put a @xmath45 upper limit on the modulated component of @xmath62 .",
    "we report on xmm - newton observation of the fourth millisecond low mass x  ray pulsar xte j1807294 .",
    "we reveal the source still in a bright state @xmath63 d after its discovery .",
    "the source luminosity is @xmath64 at a fiducial distance of 8 kpc .",
    "our results are very similar to what observed in xte j1751305 ( miller et al 2003 ) .",
    "the hard spectral component contributes most of the observed flux ( @xmath41 ) , even though a soft component ( a black body ) is needed by the data .",
    "the equivalent radius of the black body component is small , @xmath28 km , suggesting an emitting hot spot onto the neutron star surface .",
    "no emission or absorption lines are observed in the data .",
    "we study in more detail ne lines following the suggestion by yungelson , nelemans & van den heuvel ( 2002 ) and bildsten ( 2002 ) that the companions of faint transient sources are ne - rich white dwarves .",
    "we did not find any evidence of emission lines ( 41 ev and 9 ev @xmath45 upper limits for a broad or narrow line ) or absorption edges .",
    "iron lines are not detected either with upper limits of @xmath65 ev .",
    "the hard component ( the main contributor to the source flux ) can be better described with a comptonization model rather than a simple power law model .",
    "this is at variance with the case of xte j1751305 .",
    "the optical depth and the plasma temperature are highly covariant . in any case a firm upper limit on the optical depth of 4.3 ( @xmath19 c.l . )",
    "can be set .",
    "this is in line with the predictions of titarchuk , cui & wood ( 2002 ) .",
    "they suggested that x  ray pulsations can be observed in sources with an optical depth lower than @xmath66 at a plasma temperature of @xmath67 kev ( as in our case ) . for sources with a higher optical depth , e.g. @xmath68 in the z source gx 349 + 2 ( di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ) or @xmath69 in the atoll source 4u 172834 ( di salvo et al .",
